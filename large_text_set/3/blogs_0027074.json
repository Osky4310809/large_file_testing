But at the moment the job of getting people to drive EVs is a total mess, with years of planning showing little results and steady attack coming from Detroit and Washington against it all.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nThe big news of the day is that California’s electric car incentive program has not actually increased any rates of leasing new electric cars. These are unbelievably good incentives; leasing an electric car in California can cost zero dollars per month when incentives are factored in, as Automotive News pointed out today in an excellent report:\nWith state rebates, federal tax credits and manufacturer discounts, the effective monthly payments in California for zero-emission vehicles including the Nissan Motor Co. Leaf and Ford Motor Co. Focus Electric can add up to zero — or less — a month, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said in written comments to the California Air Resources Board, which meets Thursday.\n\n“Yet the ZEV market share has remained at the 3 to 3.5 percent level,” the alliance said in its 80-page submission, asking the agency known as CARB to ease up on plans to require more sales of the vehicles.﻿\n\nThese are effectively free cars. Free cars! California’s incentive system functionally has the state giving away EVs and yet they haven’t made a new dent in the market. That is insane, particularly when you realize the scale of these incentives: $7,500 of federal incentives, $2,500 of a California state discount and another $1,500 from California for low-income buyers.\nAdvertisement \n\nI personally struggle to believe that this is completely a sign of a broken system. I don’t lay all of the responsibility of electric car ownership on the thousands of dollars of incentives the state lays on electric cars themselves. I point to the cars themselves as part of the problem.\n\nOne of the state’s landmark electric cars was the Fiat 500e, with a range of 87 miles to a four-hour charge. It’s a nice car, sure, but it’s pretty obviously a niche vehicle. And that was probably the best weirdo Californian electric around. GM’s Spark EV had about as much promise of luring conventional car buyers away from gas-powered rides as free wheatgrass ice cream has a chance of luring people out of line for McBlizzards.\n\nStill, this looks pretty bad for the incentive program, and it doesn’t help the state support its increasingly-tough requirements for carmakers to sell zero-emissions vehicles within California. California wants a 40 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Along with that, CARB has projected that 40 percent of the cars an automaker sells in California will have to be all-electric, hydrogen-powered or plug-in hybrids.\n\nAn earlier focus of California’s zero-emissions mandate was on hydrogen cars, not today’s battery-electric cars.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a lobbying group that works on behalf of carmakers, is not super pleased with it, arguing on its website that these government rules do not “align with affordable technology and market realities.” The Alliance has asked for the Trump administration to “help” with the ZEV mandate (lol) and wants them to be included in the federal midterm review of emissions standards, as Automotive News reported earlier this month. Days into the new presidency, the Auto Alliance was asking Trump to turn his anti-regulation eye on ZEVs, as The Detroit Bureau reported back in November:\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:50:36.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
