Businesses are encouraged to support the strike by closing their doors or giving their female employees the day off.\nThe day is inspired in part by the Yemeni New York City bodega workers who led a strike in response to President Trump’s controversial first travel ban , as well as the “Day Without Immigrants” strike last month.\nToday, we will stand together in making a #DayWithoutAWoman a beacon of hope, energy and love.

However, the National Park Service, which operates the monument, denied that it had anything to do with the planned strike.\n“A portion of the lighting system that illuminates the Statue of Liberty experienced a temporary, unplanned outage tonight,” National Park Service public affairs officer Jerry Willis told USA Today . “The outage was most likely due to work related to an ongoing project to activate a new emergency backup generator that is part of our last remaining Hurricane Sandy recovery projects.”\nStill, the timing was just too coincidental to ignore.\nStanding Up to the Bull We’re bringing the power of women in leadership to life – right here in the center of our financial markets. pic.twitter.com/AqW492AZXJ \n— State Street (@StateStreet) March 7, 2017 \nOne change to an iconic New York City landmark was no accident.\nState Street Global Advisors, a nearly $2.5 trillion investor, placed a bronze statue of a defiant little girl standing in front of the Wall Street bull.\n“To celebrate International Women’s Day, State Street Global Advisors offered a new symbol of women in leadership,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement shared on their website. “Standing strong and confident, a new iconic landmark arrives in the one place no one can ignore — New York City’s financial district.”\nState Street vowed to push for more women to serve on the corporate boards of companies they work with.\n“Standing proudly for the promise and power of women in leadership, she is right where she belongs,” the spokesperson said.\nPresident Donald Trump ‘s Message Is Met with Criticism Trump, 70, took to Twitter early Wednesday with a message praising women.\n“I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy,” he wrote. “On International Women’s Day, join me in honoring the critical role of women here in America & around the world.”\nI have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy.\n— Donald J.
