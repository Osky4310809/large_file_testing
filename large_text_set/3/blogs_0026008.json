I did not tell him what to do,” Zierbarth said.\nThere are seven other teachers students can sign up with so they can drive with an adult with whom they are comfortable.\n“We had an understanding. He was making a choice, and I was making a choice. His name never appeared on my sign-up sheet again, so I thought it was over,” Zierbarth said.\n“I thought it was best for everyone. I didn’t want my feelings to seep into my instruction unintentionally.”\n“I believe the pledge is a sacred thing,” Ziebarth told WGN. \nThis isn’t the first time a teacher has gotten in trouble at the Blue Island high school for reprimanding Cooper for his refusal to stand.\nLast August, his Spanish teacher tried to forcibly remove him from his seat when he refused to stand for the pledge and told her “America sucks.”\nThe teacher was disciplined but not fired.\nStudents upset about Ziebarth’s dismissal have launched a Change.org petition to get him reinstated. \nIt currently has close to 800 signatures, with a goal of 1,000.\n \n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:41:51.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
