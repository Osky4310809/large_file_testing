It could be malicious but I don’t really see why someone would go out of their way to hurt those lovely animals,” Kim Aranha from Bahamas Humane Society told the Tribune 242 . A post shared by Ellen Taylor (@ellenharttaylor) on Feb 23, 2017 at 9:19am PST \nAn investigation has been launched according to Aranha, who said the deaths are “not good for the economy or tourism because if tourists come and see dead pigs on the beach, it’s not good publicity for us.” \nA total of 15 pigs remain at the beach, which in recent years has seen its popularity surge, with celebrities including Amy Schumer and Donald Trump Jr holidaying there to see the swimming pigs.
