One such spec was a “3D” sensor , and a new report from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo once again names that component.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com Kuo said the 3D sensor is revolutionary and might be used for multiple applications ranging from facial recognition for security to even gaming, according to a note obtained by 9to5Mac . Kuo “says the advanced 3D front camera system could be used in new innovative games that can accurately replace a character’s head with that of the user,” 9to5Mac said, noting this might allow users to create “selfies.”\nTango-like? 3D cameras have a wide range of uses. A module inside of Google’s Tango devices, for example, can be used for measuring distance between objects, creating a 3D augmented-reality-space and more. It’s unclear if Apple’s technology is that advanced; there’s a lot you can do with 3D cameras.\nThe iPhone 8 may cost as much as $1,000 off contract, which means it’s going to be the far more premium device out of the trio expected in September. It’s sounding more and more like this is the phone that smartphone enthusiasts will want, however.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:10:29.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
