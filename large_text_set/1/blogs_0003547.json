From social media to live events, there are so many ways that we can connect with people today. Think about connections, rather than sales, and make 10 connections every day. That can be through social media, text message, a phone call or even attending an event. \nNext, Blum says \"think free.\" Give and share something of value to potential customers -- for free. For example, if you run a yoga studio, offer a free first class. If you're a restaurant, offer a free appetizer. Give someone an experience or taste of what you have to offer. \nBlum also emphasizes the importance of being ready at all times. Being ready to accept a payment, send a proposal or sign a contract -- making your process as easy as possible for clients is vital to your success. \nTo learn more, click play. \nRelated: 3 Digital Marketing Tactics Every Small Business Can Implement Today \nEntrepreneur Network is a premium video network providing entertainment, education and inspiration from successful entrepreneurs and thought leaders.
