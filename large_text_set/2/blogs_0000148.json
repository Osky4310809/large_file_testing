Trump's international hotel company is working on a deal to put its flag in downtown Dallas. \nBut don't expect to see the \"Trump\" name on the building. \nA developer is negotiating with the Trump Organization's New York-based hotel management firm to build a small business travelers hotel on the southeast side of downtown. \nDeveloper Mike Sarimsakci said the $50 million hotel would be one of the first of a new chain of small hotels under Trump's Scion brand. \n\"They want to roll out this pretty aggressively,\" Sarimsakci said. \"It's aimed more toward millennials. \n\"It's the next generation business hotel for cost conscious travellers,\" he said. \nLast summer Trump Hotels announced the new hotel chain that will be a step below it's 5-star super luxury properties. The company said rooms in the Scion Hotels would go for between $200 and $300 a night. \nIn January Trump Hotels said it has signed letters of intent with more than a dozen developers to build Scion Hotels in markets around the country. \nAnd Trump Hotels CEO Eric Danziger identified Dallas as one of the markets the company is looking at. \nSarimsakci said he's been talking with the Trump group for more than a year. \nHe originally proposed a high-rise luxury Trump Hotel for a small vacant block on Young Street near Dallas City Hall. \nBut Sarimsakci said he decided to go with the smaller, less expensive development. \n\"I've got some friends at the Trump organization,\" he said. \"They are going to give me a license and a franchise. \n\"Dallas been on their radar and it's some thing we want to do.\" \nThe planned Trump Scion Hotel, would be built on a vacant half block at Young and St. Paul streets. The site is about a block away from where Sarimsakci has been redeveloping the historic Butler Brothers Building into loft apartments and two hotels. \nSarimsakci said that the hotels in the Butler Building are due to open in May with 274 rooms in a combination of Marriott's Townplace Suites and Fairfield Inn. \nThe planned Trump Scion Hotel across the street will be 220 rooms in a 6-story building, he said. \n\"It will have an area for collaborative users and entrepreneurs,\" Sarimsakci said. \"We wanted to dress it up and make it nice. \n\"There is a lot of glass and it will celebrate the mid century modern style.\" \nDallas-based architect 5G Studio Collaborative - the same designer for the huge Omni Dallas convention hotel - did the new Scion for Sarimsakci. \n\"It's a great fit for the neighborhood,\" he said. \"Downtown is moving toward the south.\" \nSarimsakci's Alterra International company has contracted to purchase the land from another developer. \nHe said he hopes to start construction on the Scion Hotel project before the end of the year. \nThe hotel would be just the latest in a series of new developments coming to the southeast side of downtown Dallas. \n\"With the success of major projects being redeveloped in that part of downtown Dallas like the Statler-Hilton, Lone Star Lofts and the Butler Building, there is momentum continuing to happen,\" said John Crawford with Downtown Dallas Inc. \"It's a whole new redevelopment area. \n\"That hotel would be a welcome addition to that part of downtown.\" The planned 6-story hotel would cost about $50 million. Alterra International The 220-room hotel was designed by Dallas architect 5G Studio Collaborative.
