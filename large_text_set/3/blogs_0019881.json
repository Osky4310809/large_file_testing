Credit George Etheredge for The New York Times “This project very much started with my horror at the Bou Bou case.” Kevin Sack, who wrote Saturday’s investigative article on search-warrant raids (and a second article that followed ), was speaking from the basement office of his home in Atlanta, where he is based as an investigative reporter. “The stories and photos in the Atlanta media were horrific and stuck with me until I could clear my decks of other projects,” he said. Mr. Sack was referring to the case of Bounkham Phonesavanh , known as Baby Bou Bou, who sustained extensive injuries when a flash-bang grenade landed in his playpen during a no-knock raid in Cornelia, Ga., in May 2014. (The sheriff’s deputy, Nikki Autry, who sought the no-knock warrant, was later indicted by federal prosecutors on charges of violating Bou Bou’s civil rights, but she was ultimately acquitted.) Such raids, often involving SWAT teams outfitted with repurposed military equipment, have become a common tactic in the war on drugs. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “It wasn’t just that the facts of the case were compelling,” Mr. Sack said. “It was that, in this one case, so many different problems with the forcible-entry tactic were exposed.” Mr. Sack’s two articles, totaling more than 12,000 words, have taken up the vast majority of his time for well over a year, ever since he attended Ms. Autry’s weeklong trial in December 2015. “After the trial, everything came together to reinforce my feeling that there was a lot to say about these tactics,” Mr. Sack said. “And for me, the next step was to find out how pervasive these kinds of incidents were.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Pinning down the statistics on forcible entry proved to be a Sisyphean task. As the articles indicate, there are no federal mandates requiring police departments to catalog such operations. As a result, Mr. Sack employed a variety of strategies to uncover the numbers himself. He set search-engine alerts to notify him when key terms appeared in local and national news reports, focusing on phrases like “no-knock warrant”. He combed through the filings from roughly 2,000 federal civil rights cases, isolating those that involved forcible entry in residential drug raids. And he relied on various databases compiled by outside organizations, including The Washington Post, The Guardian and the American Civil Liberties Union. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The most intensive research phase, Mr. Sack said, lasted until roughly the middle of 2016 — more than six months of digging. In the end, he identified 94 people, including 13 law enforcement officers, who had been killed as a result of forcible-entry raids from 2010 to 2016. But there is no way to know, he emphasized, how comprehensive the numbers are. \nAdvertisement “I’m very deliberate about this: I can’t say for sure that the numbers I came up with are absolute,” he said. “I think of them as a minimum. There might be many more out there.” \nAdvertisement “And in a literal sense,” he added, “there’s an uncountable number of injuries and maimings, not to mention the destruction of property.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Armed with a sense of the statistics, Mr. Sack began writing in the early fall. He quickly realized that two of the cases — those involving Henry Magee and Marvin Guy, who were the subjects of forcible-entry raids on their homes in Texas — had a number of significant parallels that, when considered in tandem, would allow for a separate narrative. (That second article can be found here .) Now, Mr. Sack, who traveled to Charleston, S.C., in December and January to cover the trial of Dylann Roof , is searching for his next assignment. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “I have some general follow-up ideas related to policing and SWAT that I’d like to at least look into,” he said. And a callout to readers for information about forcible-entry raids that may have escaped his research could lead to tips worth pursuing. Such follow-up opportunities seem to be a welcome form of continuity for Mr. Sack, who acknowledged that getting started — in particular, identifying the right subject — is often the hardest part of investigative journalism. “There comes a point where the weight of the reporting finally convinces you that you’ve got something,” he said. “But it often takes a while to get there.” A version of this article appears in print on March 19, 2017, on Page A2 of the New York edition with the headline: The Grenade in the Playpen.
