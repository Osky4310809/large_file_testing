He also announced that he would champion the legal efforts to protect the travelers with a personal donation of $100,000 with attorney Lisa Blue. \n\"We're not leaving until the job is done,\" he said at a gathering Wednesday that was part news conference and part revival, with a large crowd shouting their support and speeches by attorneys praising one another and the demonstrators. \nDallas County Judge Clay Jenkins and former Dallas City Council member Angela Hunt, a private attorney, were also at the news conference. So was Imam Omar Suleiman, who helped lead the weekend protests at the airport, and other faith leaders. \nTrump signed an order Friday that for three months will bar entry to travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Iran, Lybia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. He also suspended the refugee program for four months and banned Syrian refugees indefinitely. \nCivil rights advocates promptly challenged the order in federal courts, where judges have temporarily blocked Trump's restrictions. \nSome travelers detained at DFW Airport on Saturday told attorneys that they had been asked to sign papers expediting their removal. A stay against Trump's order was granted in a New York court late the same day, and those travelers were eventually released. \nBut since that time, others are still being held for hours at a time and being submitted to intrusive screening, according to the attorneys. They described how travelers were being asked about their religion and how authorities were extracting information from their cell phones. \nHamilton said orders are coming from Washington, D.C., to continue enforcing the travel restrictions, but he said it was unclear who was giving the instructions. \n\"It's a black hole of information,\" he said. \nThere is no public tally from an official source about the number of people who've been held at DFW Airport or submitted to additional screening as a result of Trump's order. Hamilton said lawyers are getting their information from travelers, their families and \"public servants.\" He declined to give specifics about any travelers who may be in custody right now, citing the attorneys' desire to protect their clients. \nCustoms and Border Protection representatives haven't returned multiple requests seeking comment. \nFederal officials can stop travelers coming into the United States for any number of reasons, such as concerns about contact with livestock or gifts being brought into the country. But some travelers have been held for more than four hours. \nOne wheelchair-bound Iraqi man was held for 15 hours even though he carried a special immigrant visa for helping the U.S. Army, according to attorneys. Hamilton and others had filed an emergency court petition asking for the man's release. Iraqi in wheelchair released after 15-hour detention at DFW Airport under Trump's travel ban \nThe Department of Homeland Security explained Sunday that permanent residents, or green-card holders, from the seven countries in Trump's order won't be barred from re-entering the United States. At DFW Airport, however, most of the travelers who have been held are green-card holders, Hamilton said. \nThe attorneys in the \"war room\" at the airport are working pro bono. A GoFundMe page on behalf of the group is collecting donations to pay for the hotel conference room they've been using and supplies. \nWhile community leaders hosted vigils in support of Muslims and immigrants early this week, activism in the international terminal at DFW Airport has quieted down. Attorneys continue to sit near the arrival doors to offer assistance to families of travelers who may have been stopped.
