Yet when we see someone have it — or hear about it — we still freak the f*ck out. \nNow, in certain cases getting peeved about public sex is warranted (see: sex on a motorcycle and sex at a Domino's ). But not in this case. \nA couple in Salamanca, Spain, were caught on video having sex on a balcony (presumably their apartment balcony unless they were AirBnbing or something). Spanish TV stations Telecinco and Antena 3 got ahold of the footage and proceeded to shame the couple on national TV, according to The Sun . \nThe neighbors were reportedly upset about the public display, but the situation was different online. Commenters on the video defended the couple and hell, I will, too. \nI'm not saying I'm down to watch my neighbors get it on in the balcony next to me, but damn, what's the big f*cking deal? They were having sex — deal with it. Public sex is great, public sex is fun and sex itself makes you happier — and happier people are happier neighbors. So maybe instead of criticizing, you should try it sometime (here's how to do it without getting caught ). Drop This Fact \nThe couple who had sex in the Domino's ended up getting charged, but only the woman because the guy was seen fully-clothed on camera.
