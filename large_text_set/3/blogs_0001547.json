By Jenny McCoy Friday, March 3, 2017, 3:54 pm Amesy / Getty Many runners are familiar (read: all too familiar) with the black toenail . The condition involves bruising, blistering or bleeding beneath the nail from repetitive trauma, either of the top of the shoe banging against the nail or the toe slamming into the end of the shoe. It’s most commonly experienced by marathoners and those training at especially high intensity. Some even see it as a badge of honor: the more black nails, the more badass. 1/5 Ictor / Getty Repetitive Trauma The most common culprit for black nails, repetitive trauma can result from running, or from wearing any type of ill-fitting footwear. If a black nail crops up shortly after a workout or a day spent in too-tight or too-loose shoes, this is likely the cause. Repetitive trauma ranges from mild (i.e. a small, painless, black-and-blue discoloration beneath the nail), to severe (i.e. large, bloody blisters between your nail and nail plate), explains Dr. Jacqueline Sutera, D.P.M. and spokesperson for the American Podiatric Medical Association . In mild cases, no treatment is needed and the black nail will simply grow out. In severe cases, beneath-the-nail blisters can cause the nail to detach—either partially or fully—from the nail plate. This process can be quite painful if the detachment is only partial, warns Dr. Lori Weisenfeld, NYC sports podiatrist, explaining that once the nail fully separates from nail plate, it is officially dead and will never reattach. The good new about this: it’s no longer painful. The bad news: it can take a long time for a new nail to grow in—about a year for big toenails and 3 to 6 months for smaller nails. In certain cases, a fresh nail can begin growing underneath an old, dead nail. If there’s additional repetitive trauma, the new nail can become bruised and detached as well. To prevent this, Weisenfeld recommends visiting your doctor who can trim down or entirely remove the dead nail, which will allow the new nail room to grow in properly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:37:57.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
