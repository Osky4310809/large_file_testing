Facebook claims its solution was shaped by discussions with \"policymakers and civil rights leaders\" it has since had.\nBONUS: Facebook's new Privacy Basics", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/qgE4NqTZ.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/qgE4NqTZ.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-09T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:41:00.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
