Not only is the feeling itself extremely unpleasant, but stress makes everything in your life worse ( even the simple stuff ). Stress is like a boulder rolling downhill, picking up speed and smashing everything in its path. Here are six things that happen when you’re stressed that just make you more stressed. 1. Breakouts \n(source) \nStress can make your skin break out, and what’s more stressful than having a face covered in zits? Why does skin even want to zit? It’s so unnecessary. Breakouts always come at the worst time, like when you have picture day or prom, exactly because you’re worried that you’ll get a breakout. It’s Murphy’s law of acne. 2. Getting sick \n(source) \nStress lowers your immune system, which makes you more susceptible to illness. That’s why you always get sick at the absolute worst time. When you’re stressed out studying for finals, you're for sure going to catch a cold. Then you’re stressed because your cold is interfering with your studying. It never ends. 3. Hardening arteries \n(source) \nAutopsies on people as young as 19 show that the first part of the human body to start aging are your arteries. Even young people who die in accidents show symptoms of plaque building up in their arteries. Hardening arteries comes from both poor eating habits as well as stress. And what is more stressful than knowing at 19 you’re already aging? 4. Insomnia \n(source) \nStress can keep you from sleeping, and nothing makes you more stressed than not being able to sleep. God damn this is such an evil cycle. The pressure just heightens every night that you can’t get to sleep and you feel sh*tty and stressed all day long. 5. Gaining weight \n(source) \nIt’s easy to put on five or 10 pounds out of the blue when you’re stressed. A high level of the stress hormone cortisol makes you crave junk food, and then you store that junk food in your belly fat. There are few things more stressful than trying to put on your pants in the morning and finding that nothing fits. Then, if you’re stressed because you’re busy, you might not have enough time to eat well and work out and get those pants to fit again. 6. Procrastinating \n(source) \nWhen you feel really stressed, your to-do list feels even more unmanageable. So you put it off, because it all feels like too much. But guess what? It’s now even later, and you haven’t done your work, so now you’re more stressed. \nWhat stress situations make you stressed?
