From comforting orphaned pigs with giant stuffed animals to spending hours under the sweltering summer sun to save a kitten who was trapped between two metal sheds, Edgar’s Mission is a pioneer in rescuing animals and providing them with a safe and loving forever home . And this story is just one of the many examples proving just that. \nBenjamin the goat recently went to the vet to have laser treatment on one of his joints. The little one was suffering from a build up of scar tissue after sustaining a soft tissue injury. To protect Benjamin’s eyes from the laser, he was provided these super cute glasses to rock. It’s so amazing to see the lengths Edgar’s Mission is going to help this adorable baby goat. Benjamin is in great hands! \n\n\nTo some, the idea of going to such an extent to ensure the comfort and well-being of a goat might seem absurd, but anyone who has met a goat knows they’re not too different from our cats and dogs. Goats are highly intelligent and emotional animals, they also make wonderful mothers. Even after years of separation, a mother goat will remember her baby’s call , illustrating the deep bond shared between these dynamic beings. And as seen from the above photo, goats are also quite stylish! \nWe know that Benjamin is going to get the chance at a happy life he never would have been had he grown up on a commercial farm. However, now that he is in the safe embrace of Edgar’s Mission he will live out his days surrounded by sheer joy and love! As Edgar’s Mission says, “If we could live happy and healthy without harming others, why wouldn’t we?” \nTo keep up with the amazing work Edgar’s Mission does, follow them on Facebook .
