The Colombian climber had to withstand an onslaught from Contador, who was looking to overturn a 31 second lead on the final stage of the race and despite losing over minute inside the last hour of racing, the Team Sky rider rallied to deny Contador a famous victory.

David de la Cruz won the pulsating stage but the race will be remembered for Contador's attack from 50 kilometres out and Henao's desperate and ultimately successful chase. \"It's a reward after the terrible moments that I've been through,\" Henao said in relation to past injury problems. \n\"Today the sun came out for me and I'm very happy. I'd like to dedicate this win to the team and all the staff, the mechanics, and to Dave Brailsford as well.\" \nBrailsford was at the race on the final stage but refused to talk to Cyclingnews. He has been under intense pressure in recent months due to the on going UKAD investigation into a potential violation that occurred under his watch. Henao had said before the final stage that if he won, he would dedicate the victory to his team boss. \n\"He was always there when I needed him. He was there when I was injured, when I crashed several years ago and my knee was completely destroyed, he was there to support me.\" \nContador had Team Sky on the ropes when he attacked on the penultimate climb, and having dropped Henao on stage 7, it looked as though Spaniard would win the overall for the first time in ten years. \nHowever, it was not to be and Henao first subdued a number of other attacking rivals before stemming the tide against Contador. The Colombian rode a tactically astute race. He was on the right side of the cross-winds on stage 1, finished second on the stage to Fayence, and then managed his losses against a surging Contador. \n\"I did panic a little bit when the gap was over a minute,\" he admitted. \n\"I was not getting help from the other teams but it was simple as to what I needed to do. I had to do a time trial uphill and then give all I had on the down hills. The team worked very hard for me. I knew that it would be difficult and that I would need to fight until the last meter.\" \n\"Contador is the sort of rider who always attacks. I knew that he would attack and I was ready for it.\" \nRead more on this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T09:02:04.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
