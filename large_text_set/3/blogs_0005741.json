These documents detail CIA cyber operations which include hacking a television so that it pretends to be off while recording targets. \nOne document detailing notes of an October 2014 meeting of the “embedded development branch” says a potential target is “vehicle systems.” WikiLeaks wrote in a press release, “the purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.” \nWired has previously reported on how hackers were able to take control of a car’s controls and disable the brakes. The CIA has not confirmed nor denied the validity of the documents released by WikiLeaks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:57:18.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
