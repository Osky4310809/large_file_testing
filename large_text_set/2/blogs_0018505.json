At least…this wallaby seems to think so.\nWallaby? What? Yup, Ariel Winter posted a hilarious wallaby picture on her Insta! And um, we’re jealous that she and her BF Levi Meaden got to hang out at the famous Taronga Zoo during their summer vacation in Australia (where Meaden has been working on Pacific Rim Uprising ), let alone step inside the wallaby’s stomping ground! No fair! Just kidding…we’re super happy for them, and this selfie is utterly perfect. Animals just get us every time.\nShe wanted us all to do Blue Steel but we weren't down. #selfie @tarongazoo \nA post shared by ARIEL WINTER (@arielwinter) on Feb 19, 2017 at 3:12pm PST \n“She wanted us all to do Blue Steel but we weren’t down,” Winter wrote in the caption. via GIPHY During their visit, Winter and Meaden also got to spend quality time with the…SNAKES! We’re not AS jealous of that perhaps for obvious reasons, but it does look kinda fun.\nHe slithered into our DMs @tarongazoo \nA post shared by ARIEL WINTER (@arielwinter) on Feb 19, 2017 at 1:34am PST \n\nOkay, these two lovebirds are just the cutest (even when holding a slithering snake). We couldn’t be happier for Winter and her new beau , who are utterly charming together.\nWuv uuu to da \nA post shared by ARIEL WINTER (@arielwinter) on Jan 15, 2017 at 11:56pm PST \nOh my, this is almost too much. Is that the Sydney Opera House in the background? Quick question, why weren’t we invited on this magical trip?\nA beautiful lady came to visit me while I'm working. #luckyman \nA post shared by Levi Meaden (@levi_meaden) on Jan 19, 2017 at 1:09am PST \nAriel, are you there? WHY?! \nGetting ready for @glamourmag's Women of the Year LIVE summit! #glamourWOTY see you soon;) \nA post shared by ARIEL WINTER (@arielwinter) on Nov 14, 2016 at 11:50am PST \nOkay, calming down. We’re totally vicariously living through Winter right now. Or maybe, planning a quick trip to the land Down Under, because there’s no time like the present.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:41:58.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
