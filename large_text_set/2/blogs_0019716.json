So what should we take from this? Quite a bit, actually. \nOn the sides, we have volume rocker, SIM tray (likely doubles as SD card tray too), and a metal frame. That’s all good, but nothing ground breaking. However, you get an expanded view of the overall design and minimal bezel on the front, which is sure to be a selling point for LG to push. \nThe 5.7-inch QHD+ LCD display with its 18:9 ratio, does appear to take up almost all of the front, just like we saw in leaks . There is still some bezel, which I actually appreciate as someone who hates the idea of unwanted touches happening as I grip a phone that lacks all side-bezel. \nAs for the back, you can see the double-camera setup that LG announced as dual-13MP shooters . The fingerprint reader is there as well, and it should double as the power button, just like the past half-dozen or so LG devices. Finally, you’ll notice that the camera housing is flush to the body, unlike the V20 and G5 from last year. \nAgain, this looks like all of the leaks that have popped up over the past month or so. Thoughts? \n…could’ve been the Nexus 7X… Orion \nNot going to lie….looks fantastic. drewthebrave \nI think it looks great. Screen to bezel ratio is fantastic! Now if only it worked on Project Fi… TechGuy22 \nit better not be over 600 dollars Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nI’m a fan. i would l ve if that front earpeice doubled as a front facing speaker to give this sort of an HTC 10 sound. \nwill be looking forward to some reviews to see if this is worthy of a purchase! Daistaar \nI’d prefer it without the peach fuzz. Bald or nothing baby! Jérôme Besnard \nLove it! Kevin Davis \nVery nice looking phone. I like it a lot, and they’ve done a good job at toning down the “surprised robot ” look for the rear camera module. Good luck to Lg. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nI read a “report” somewhere that there will be a difference between US and International devices… Metal back vs Glass Back… Maybe this is why the phones look so different in leaks. \nLike here… this back definitely looks like metal. I guess I could be wrong though. \nhttp://www.droid-life.com/2017/02/03/more-lg-g6-photos/ disastrousrainbow \nBest case scenario is there’s just different styles available. Remember when the HTC One M8 had a brushed metal variant and a more standard metal-ish color with all other colors? Perhaps LG is approaching it that way with the G6 and we’ll get a glass backed variant and metal one to choose from. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nThat would make sense, but ever since the first black version leaked, and now this render this Back just doesn’t look like metal at all. Especially with how glossy it is. And isnt this phone supposed to have wireless charging? disastrousrainbow \nMaybe they figured out a way? Or it could’ve just been a prototype design because one thing that struck me as odd about that metal version was the lack of antenna lines on the back. Then again that could be because they’re utilizing a primer like they did with the G5 but if that’s the case then…eww. paul_cus \nI really like what the LG did with the design. Very sleek. Thinking it’s probably going to be my next phone. I’m kinda partial to the silver version, personally. s_man \nIs it me or the back looks more like glass than metal zookeeper116", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:10:03.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
