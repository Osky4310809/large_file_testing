John Lewis (D-Ga.) was the target of Donald Trump’s Twitter tirade after saying he was not a “legitimate president.” (JOSHUA ROBERTS/REUTERS) SPECIAL TO THE DAILY NEWS Sunday, January 15, 2017, 3:41 PM \nRepresentative John Lewis is a genuine American hero. One of the original Freedom Riders, Lewis was beaten nearly to death by white supremacists as he campaigned for civil rights in the South. \nDonald J. Trump is a bully, a narcissist, and a liar. After Lewis said that he was not a “legitimate president,” the notoriously thin-skinned President-elect tweeted false information about Lewis’ congressional district and claimed that Lewis was “all talk” and “no action.” \nNevertheless, Lewis was wrong to say that Trump won’t be our rightful leader. Indeed, Lewis’ remark sunk to the level of . . . Donald J. Trump. It played fast and loose with the facts, and it placed Lewis’ enemy — in this case, Trump himself — beyond the pale of decency and dignity. It rendered Trump not just as an opponent but as a fraud, who obtained his power via underhanded means. \nAnd Lewis simply doesn’t know whether that’s true. \"I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected,” Lewis said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” which was aired on Sunday. “And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.” \nTrump cancels MLK day visit to African American history museum \nReally? The Russians did attempt to undermine Clinton, of course, as a declassified intelligence report by three security agencies confirmed earlier this month. But that’s very different from saying that their intervention affected “political processes” or swung the election to Trump, as the same report emphasized. \nNobody — including John Lewis — has any idea whether the Russians’ efforts had their desired effect. The Senate Intelligence Committee recently announced that it would investigate alleged ties between Russia and members of Trump’s campaign, which is exactly what it should do. But even if we uncover links of that sort, we might never know if they actually altered the outcome in November. \nPretending otherwise is worse than deceptive. It undermines our institutions, just as the Russians hoped. And it also echoes Donald Trump, who spent much of his campaign complaining that the election was “rigged.” He also insisted that our government had failed African-Americans, whom he repeatedly described as mired in destitution and violence. \nTrump was at it again in his reply to Lewis, claiming that the congressman’s Atlanta district was “in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested).” Yes, there are pockets of poverty and crime in Lewis’ district, which is majority African-American. But it also includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the busiest airport in the world, and many other markers of growth and prosperity. Throughout his campaign, Trump suggested the political system was “rigged.” (Evan Vucci/AP) \nAnd as far as Lewis being all talk and no action . . . that’s plainly absurd, another one of Trump’s unfounded Twitter gems. Let’s leave aside what Lewis has or hasn’t done for his Congressional district, and think about what he has done for his country. He gave his blood — and, almost, his life — to challenge racism, the biggest blot on our collective soul. No action? Please. \nNow, more than at any time in our recent past, it’s our country that we all need to think about. That’s what President Obama said the day after the election, congratulating Trump on his victory and calling on Americans to join hands across their differences. “We have to remember that we’re actually all on one team,” Obama said. “We’re not Democrats first. We’re not Republicans first. We are Americans first.” \nObama repeated those themes in his stunning farewell address last week in Chicago, where he quoted Atticus Finch from “To Kill a Mockingbird.” “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view,” Finch says, in the passage Obama quoted, “until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” \nBut to do that, you have to show more respect for your opponents than Donald Trump has displayed. He consistently dismisses his foes as illegitimate, not just ill-advised. And that’s why it was so sad (to use one of Trump’s own favorite adjectives) to see John Lewis doing the same thing. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump calls Rep. John Lewis 'sad!' \nObama’s final speech also quoted George Washington’s farewell address, which urged Americans to protect the “sacred ties” between them. “We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others; when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and blame the leaders without examining our own role in electing them.” \nDonald Trump devoted much of his campaign to defining immigrants and Muslims as somehow less than American, and to suggesting that the whole political system was corrupt. But he wrong. For good or ill, we made Trump our President. It’s time to stop blaming the Russians — or anyone else — for that. \nJonathan Zimmerman teaches education and history at the University of Pennsylvania.
