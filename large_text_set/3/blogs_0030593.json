Ian Rush found the back of the net 25 times against Everton (Photo: Getty Images) \nHe notched a staggering 25 in his time and Everton fans were no doubt delighted when he left the club for Leeds United in 1996. \nRush's most memorable Merseyside derby came in 1982, when he smashed four goals past the Toffees in a 5-0 win at Goodison Park. Steven Gerrard \nGames: 27 \nGoals: 8 \nLike Rush, Steven Gerrard is someone who needs no introduction in Liverpool, and another star who loved a goal against the Toffees. \nBorn in Whiston, the now 36-year-old always had a fans' understanding about how much the game meant to everyone in the city. Steven Gerrard scored a goal to remember against the Toffees in 2001 (Photo: LFC) \nAnd of course made sure that knowledge transferred onto the pitch in the form of eight goals in 27 games against the Toffees. \nPerhaps his most memorable was his first derby goal - a thunderbolt of a shot that stunned everyone at Goodison Park in 2001. Robbie Fowler \nGames: 17 \nGoals: 6 \nOne of the game's great finishers, Robbie Fowler was always going to get goals against Everton, and that he did. \nIn 17 games for the Reds he found the back of the net six times. Robbie Fowler bagged two in a 3-2 victory back in 1999 (Photo: Allsport) \nHis most memorable Merseyside derby came in 1999 when he bagged two great goals in a 3-2 win - securing Liverpool's first victory over Everton in five years. \nHis infamous 'eating the grass' celebration also made an appearance in this game. Kenny Dalglish \nGames: 23 \nGoals: 5 \nKing Kenny is a fan's favourite having represented the club as a player and later going on to manage them. \nHe found the back of the net five times against Everton and in total for Liverpool scored on a staggering 172 occasions. King Kenny scored just 20 seconds from kick-off back in 1985 (Photo: Getty Images) \nIn 1985 the Reds recorded a 3-2 win over their rivals at Goodison park, with Dalglish getting himself on the score sheet. \nThe game was particularly memorable for the Scottish striker as he put his side ahead just 20 seconds after kick-off. Luis Suarez \nGames: 6 \nGoals: 5 \nDespite not playing in half as many Merseyside derbies as the above legends, Luis Suarez made his mark in them. \nIn just six appearances he found the back of the net five times. Luis Suarez dived in front of David Moyes after putting Liverpool ahead in 2012 (Photo: Getty) \nA controversial character but also a genius with a football at his feet, his most memorable goal against the Toffees came in a 2-2 draw in 2012. \nThe Reds threw away a two-goal lead on the day, but it was Suarez's celebration to breaking the deadlock - a dive at the feet of David Moyes, after he claimed the Uruguayan went down too easily - that will always be remembered. poll loading What's your Mersey derby prediction? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:10:21.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
