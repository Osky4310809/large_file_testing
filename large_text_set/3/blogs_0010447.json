Save Codame \nRobots are usually created to help us, but that's not always the case. Last week, California's Palm Desert was home to a machine that was different. ShyBot didn't serve us at all, instead -- as its name suggests -- it had a reclusive mission: stay as far away from people as it could. \nShyBot was designed by Italian artist Norma Jeane and a team of engineers from Codame for the DesertX art exhibition, in collaboration with the San Francisco Italian Cultural Institute . In her artist statement , Jeane said the robot is \"based on an algorithm designed precisely to evade the human perspective.\" So, from February 27th to March 4th, the six-wheeler evaded as well as it could, roaming the Coachella Valley in an effort to hide from everybody. ShyBot was so anti-social that it even avoided the drones used to film its adventure if they got too close. \nAs the autonomous, solar-powered rover traversed the California desert, it was tracked in real time using GPS technology, curious viewers can revisit the whole journey here . While Shybot avoided being seen, it did have a camera that transmitted its point of view to San Francisco art gallery The Lab for an exhibition called \"Norma Jeane: Scene with ShyBot.\" We're sure it hated the attention, even from afar. \nThe sad irony is, that we've never wanted to hug a robot more. Still, at least we don't have to worry about this one eventually enslaving humanity in a merciless machine uprising.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:39:26.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
