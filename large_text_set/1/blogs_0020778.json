It was an incredible show of solidarity, with many famous faces doing their bit for women’s rights (even if one of them did threaten to blow up the White House ). It was amazing to see so many people all over the world unite for an important reason.\nWhat a remarkable view! #WomensMarch \nA photo posted by Legally ⚖ Brunette (@legally.brunette.kw) on Jan 24, 2017 at 3:02am PST \nHowever, not everyone could make it down to the marches happening. For example, Rose Redfern couldn’t attend the march in Washington, D.C., to support her sisters, so she instead decided that she’d host her own Women’s March at home with some of her own squad: her dolls.\nRose’s father, Mark Redfern, shared pictures of his daughter’s adorable yet powerful march, in which Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Cinderella, Poison Ivy, and Tiana from Disney’s The Frog Princess were all in attendance.\n& Our own Woman's March.\nNai-post ni Mark Redfern noong  Sabado, Enero 21, 2017 What’s more, Mark helped his daughter out with her signs, some of which could totally match the incredible ones that were present in Washington and at other cities.\n& Don't forget that Supergirl is an illegal alien. Don't think the wall would stop her.\nNai-post ni Mark Redfern noong  Sabado, Enero 21, 2017 We’re pretty taken with Cinderella’s sign. Crack that glass ceiling, girl!\n& Cinderella doesn't think our president is any kind of Prince Charming.\nNai-post ni Mark Redfern noong  Sabado, Enero 21, 2017 Personally, however, this is the one we relate to most.\n& Tiana doesn't need a frog prince.\nNai-post ni Mark Redfern noong  Sabado, Enero 21, 2017 In his Facebook posts, Mark also pointed out that Rose wanted to make her own sign.\n“Rose made some signs too. The scribbled one is apparently about love,” he wrote. & Rose made some signs too. The scribbled one is apparently about love.\nNai-post ni Mark Redfern noong  Sabado, Enero 21, 2017 Tbh, we’re pretty impressed with Rose’s ingenuity and dedication to the cause. It’s great to see such a young woman standing up for what she believes in, and encouraging her friends (or dolls) to get involved, too. More power to you Rose!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T14:04:49.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
