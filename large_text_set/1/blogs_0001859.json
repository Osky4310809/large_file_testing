The news came after Leslie Jordan, who played Beverly Leslie on the show, seemed to say that the show was “absolutely” coming back.\nJordan’s comments come after the four original main cast members — Will, Grace, Karen, and Jack, played perfectly by Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally, and Sean Hayes — returned for a special one-off scene of the show around the Presidential election.\nSince then rumors of a reboot have been spreading wildly. Firstly, Deadline reported that NBC was *seriously* considering a short run of reunion episodes . Then, Megan Mullally stoked the fire in an interview with Pride Source , where she said there was a “good chance” that the show was coming back.\n“It’s not happening right this second. I mean, we’re not rehearsing or anything like that. But there is a very good chance that something is going to materialize,” she revealed. “But can’t really talk about it or say anything, because you know how it is.” However, now Debra Messing has quietly put a dampener on the Will & Grace reunion rumors. \nResponding to a fan on Twitter, Messing, who played interior designer Grace Adler in the sitcom for eight seasons, said that nothing had been 100% confirmed.\nWhen asked whether it was true that show had been commissioned for 10 episodes by NBC, Messing said:\n“Sadly Leslie was wrong. Nothing beyond talks.” Sadly Leslie was wrong. Nothing beyond talks. https://t.co/NDmKoH2Iql \n— Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) January 2, 2017 Okay…while this news is rather upsetting, it’s not all doom and gloom. What we do know, then, is that while Will & Grace isn’t quite in pre-production, there are talks of a reunion and, from the other interviews and comments that fellow cast members have given, it seems that things are heading in a positive direction.\nThus, 2017 *could* 100% still bring us a Will & Grace reunion and we’ve got everything crossed!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T11:36:30.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
