The 21-year-old Ijebu Ode, Ogun State indigene was buried around 2pm on Thursday after a 21-gun salute at the parade ground, as colleagues and family members paid their last respect to the victim. PUNCH Metro had reported that Sholape, aka Shomzy, and Kalu had met on a parade ground at the Air Force Base, Makurdi, Benue State, and struck a romantic relationship. Kalu had allegedly shot dead his lover on March 12, 2017, after accusing her of having romantic affairs with other men. He was thereafter arrested and detained at the base. A note reportedly written by Kalu later emerged on some social media platforms, in which he allegedly said only idiots would call him a fool for his action. The air force authorities were reported to have ordered a psychiatric test on the suspect, saying the circumstances of the case required the test before his eventual dismissal and prosecution for the crime. On Thursday, some family members of Sholape went to the air force base at Ikeja, Lagos, to receive the corpse after it arrived aboard a military plane at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja. After certifying that the body was indeed that of Sholape, they joined in following the hearse to the Ojo Military Cantonment, Ojo. PUNCH Metro learnt that after a short burial service, the coffin, which was wrapped with the Nigerian flag, was opened again for friends and family members before Sholape was eventually interred. The elder sister of the victim, Jolaade Oladipupo, said the family had to wait for about one hour at Ikeja before the corpse arrived. She said, “After the corpse arrived around 9am, five of us were asked to step forward to identify her. She was dressed in the air force ceremonial uniform. We were in tears and I felt like asking her to wake up and follow us home. The military authorities asked us if she was the one, and we said yes. “Then she was put into a hearse and we went to the Ojo Cantonment, where they also had a parade and a 21-gun salute. It was an emotional moment for the family.” PUNCH Metro gathered that Sholape was the eight of 11 children and lived with Jolaade at their family house in Badagry before she joined the air force. Jolaade explained that the deceased had attempted joining the force several times without success until she was shortlisted to join the air force. She said, “She had always wanted to join the force. She was a strong girl and always fought for people’s rights. Before she joined the air force, she had applied to join the police, the army and navy,without any success. She didn’t give up until her application to the air force succeeded. “On the night that she was killed, we had earlier spoke and I advised her to further her studies in order to get accelerated promotion in the air force. She told me that she had told her boyfriend that she didn’t have time for any relationship and that she wanted to concentrate on her studies. She said she planned to buy the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination form. That was the night that the man killed her.” The 31-year-old said only justice would assuage the pain of the family.
