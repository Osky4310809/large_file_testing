After realizing that the attacker’s gun is jammed up, the two square off in a heated skirmish. \nLater, Black takes aim at the KKK by standing in front of a burning cross. As he dances and raps away in front of his crew, a nearby KKK effigy is spotted hanging on a cross. \n“I jumped out of that wraith, Kodak bought a wraith/ I get any girl I want, any girl I want/ She want me to save the day, but I ain’t got a cape,” the Florida MC raps on the Metro Boomin’ and Southside-produced beat. \nBlack will join Future on his Nobody Safe Tour alongside Migos and Tory Lanez , kicking off this May in Memphis. \nCheck out the Michael Garcia-directed video below. \n[embedded content]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:43:40.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
