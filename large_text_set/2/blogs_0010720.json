Their journey to the land down under together is the BFF pairing we didn’t know we needed.\nThe two actresses are set to star in Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time , so their traveling is actually for work. Despite the fact that they had to get together to film in New Zealand, they didn’t have to go on the same flight, but luckily they did.\nWitherspoon and Kaling’s friendship is one of the more secret friendships in Hollywood, but we love it just the same. The first time we really saw it was when Kaling created “Wreath Witherspoon” on her TV show, The Mindy Project . It is a Christmas wreath with pictures of Reese and it’s awesome.\nShe later donned a tee from one of Witherspoon’s Draper James collections . Oh, and then Witherspoon approved of the TV wreath and read Kaling’s book ! Now they are showing off their real-life friendship in a tropical destination and we’re all for it.\n“I am headed here for work and I could not be more excited. I even rewatched Lord of the Rings as a primer. I usually play characters that work in American offices so this is big change!,” The Mindy Project star captioned her travel photo. “Plus so much stellar comedy from here. Any lovely Kiwis out there have recommendations for me? Your country is so beautiful and I am lucky to be able to go. #travel #newzealand #anIndianGirlinNZ.” I am headed here for work and I could not be more excited.
