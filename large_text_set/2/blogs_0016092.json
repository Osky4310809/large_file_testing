Twitter Ivanka was responding to a series of disturbing news reports about incidents made against the Jewish community in the United States. \nOver the weekend, more than 150 headstones were damaged in a Jewish cemetery in Missouri. Police are investigating.

The Trump administration has not been particularly strong in condemning anti-Semitism. \nIn fact, the Trump administration has been accused of encouraging anti-Semitism instead. \nThroughout the election, Donald Trump used anti-Semitic rhetoric . His election was marked by an increase in visible incidents of anti-Semitism, including online. “His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension.” Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect \nTrump has taken to using the phrase “America First,” which has an anti-Semitic history. He hired Steve Bannon as his chief strategist, who has been linked to anti-Jewish sentiment. \nTrump wrote a statement for International Holocaust Remembrance Day without using the word “Jews.” \nJust last week, he refused to answer a Jewish reporter with a question about efforts to stop anti-Semitism committed in Trump’s name.

Twitter \nHillary Clinton tweeted on Tuesday, February 21 that “everyone must speak out” against Jewish attacks. She tagged @POTUS directly, saying he needs to say something. \nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler of New York said on CNN by not speaking out, Trump “refused the elementary duty of a president — to denounce the wave of bigotry and help stop it.” Rep. Jerry Nadler blasts Trump: \"He's refused the elementary duty of a president to denounce the wave of bigotry.\" https://t.co/45TCJvBk93 \n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 21, 2017 Trump briefly touched on the attacks on Tuesday at the National Museum of African American Museum and Culture. \nThe president said , \nThe anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil. \nHe added in an interview with MSNBC, “Anti-Semitism is horrible and it’s going to stop and it has to stop,” which is just so meaningful.
