Soon, we’re going to hear the story of a wealthy family who lost everything, and exactly how the Bluths got to be the Bluths in the first place: We’re going back to the beginning with Michael, GOB, Tobias, Lindsay, George Sr., and Lucille. Season 5 will be a prequel.\nAccording to TVLine — who spoke to Bluth family insiders — Season 5 will be set present-day, and also in the past. Specifically:\n“Potentially half of the action unfolding in flashbacks featuring much younger versions of all the principal characters (played by different actors).” This would be to alleviate the stress of trying to schedule Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, Toby Hale, Portia de Rossi, David Cross, Jeffrey Tambor, Jessica Walter, Michael Cera, and Alia Shawkat to all appear in the same room at the same time. They are all very busy people.\nBy using the prequel technique, “More of the episodes can now include all of the original cast together, with lots of big group family scenes,” the source continued. One of the major complaints about the (still pretty good) Season 4 is that it was obviously most of the cast was not together at the time of filming. There was that big scene in the police station with everyone…but that was it. Then everyone went on their merry way with their own Bluth family storylines.\nThere was a lil’ bit of a prequel element to Season 4 already, with Kristen Wiig and Seth Rogen playing young Lucille and George. It was great. Mike Yarish/Netflix Now, it sounds like we’ll be in for more of that. Wiig and Rogen could obviously reprise their roles again, but imagine going back to the very beginning when Lucille and George first met.\nThe Bluth children have also appeared as young kids before, but now it sounds like we’ll see a lot more of their early years.\nFox While this is an interesting route to go, honestly, we’ll take it if it means we get more Arrested Development in our lives and SOON.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:56:00.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
