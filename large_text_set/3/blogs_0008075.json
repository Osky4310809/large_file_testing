Garoppolo will either leave his new team via free agency, get the franchise tag from that team, or sign a big-money long-term deal with that team. So adding the cost of two first-round picks likely explains why it has been reported that the Patriots simply won’t be trading Garoppolo. The likelihood of any team being willing to part with two first-round picks — even for a QB-desperate franchise like the Browns — has to be close to zero.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:09:35.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
