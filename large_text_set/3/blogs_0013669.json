The hottie is now retuning to the silver screen with Anees Bazmi ‘s next, Mubarkan , alongside Arjun Kapoor and Anil Kapoor . \nKaran will be seen playing an NRI Punjabi in the romcom, and his character reportedly required him to undergo some physical transformation. Speaking to TOI about the film, Karan said: \nI have grown up watching Anil (Kapoor) sir’s films and it’s an honour to shoot with him. I learn so much every day. The feeling when he shakes hands with me on the set is unexplainable. It’s like a big Punjabi family coming together on a set. We crack jokes, talk in Punjabi and Anil sir shares anecdotes with us. \nWe are quite excited to see this hottie on the big screen!
