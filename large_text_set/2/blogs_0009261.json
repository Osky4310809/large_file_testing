Today we were poor and feel very disappointed but be careful – it is only our third defeat in the Premier League and we are one point above Liverpool still.” \nPochettino clearly believes that his side suffer from unfair expectations after creating hope among Spurs fans by over-achieving against rivals with deeper pockets. \nSpurs have only the sixth-highest wage-bill in the Premier League but have provided the most consistent challenge to Chelsea this season — just as they did to Leicester last season. \n“If you compare Tottenham with the other sides competing for the top four, maybe you should say, 'Wow, they deserve a lot of credit for where they are now,’” said Pochettino.

We are a club fighting for the Premier League with different tools in a different project. \n“We can’t compare with another team. Chelsea have a lot of players who know what it means to win and we are creating a winning mentality. I am disappointed today, but feel calm.” \nPochettino acknowledged a lifeless first-half display at Anfield gave Spurs a mountain to climb against a Liverpool side that had won just once in 10 previous games. \nHe said: “In the first 45 minutes you saw a team that is not ready to fight for the Premier League.” poll loading Will Tottenham finish in the top four? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:50:02.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
