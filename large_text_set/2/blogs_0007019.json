(Johnson family photo) \nIt was October 2015, and for one night, Latasha Johnson had run out of options. \nSix months after being evicted from her Breckenridge Hills apartment, she was on the streets. No apartment. No car. No money for a hotel. She found a place for her daughter Gabrielle, to stay for the night. She was 9 at the time. \nThen she curled up for the night in a side entrance to the Peabody Opera House , out of the way, so nobody would bother her. “It was not a good feeling at all,” Johnson says. \nWe were drinking coffee last week at the Denny’s on Hampton Avenue, where she’s worked since about a month after that fateful night on the street. Since that time, the 34-year-old has run the gamut on homeless services in St. Louis. She spent a few nights at the New Life Evangelistic Center run by the Rev. Larry Rice. “It was horrible,” she says. Eventually she found her way to Gateway 180 , and now she’s in transitional housing. Soon, she hopes to be in her own apartment again. \nThat’s where she was in March 2015 when her troubles began in earnest. Johnson was living in the Hickory Trace Apartments . She had moved in the previous fall, but had noted problems with the livability of her unit from the beginning. The shower was missing tiles, and the issue never got fixed by the landlord, Kohner Properties Inc. Eventually, mold started appearing. Then, one night, the ceiling in the bathroom caved in. \n“I heard this big boom at 3 o’clock in the morning,” Johnson remembers. “Half the ceiling was in the bathtub.” \nAccording to court records, Johnson asked the landlord to fix the problem. She had complained several times about mold. Instead, a black plastic tarp was hung over the hole in the ceiling. The mold was causing health problems for Johnson’s daughter, who has cystic fibrosis. Eventually, Johnson got a hotel to stay in for a few nights. She told the landlord she wouldn’t pay her rent until the problem was fixed. \nKohner sued and started eviction proceedings. Johnson, with the help of Legal Services of Eastern Missouri , countersued, claiming a breech of contract under a section of law that gives renters a right to “implied warranty of habitability.” \nIn St. Louis County Circuit Court, Johnson lost. Circuit Judge Judy Draper awarded Kohner a judgment of more than $2,100. She agreed with Kohner’s legal argument that for Johnson to be able to make a legal claim that she has a right to withhold rent, she actually would have to pay that rent to the court to hold it in escrow while the dispute is being litigated. \nFor a poor person, this creates a Sophie’s Choice: Pay rent to the court and stay in the uninhabitable apartment, or do what Johnson did and go to a hotel, and get evicted. \nIt’s unfair, says Lee Camp, Johnson’s attorney, because the requirement would, in effect, bar access to the courts for poor people. Camp appealed the circuit court ruling and in September, a unanimous Eastern District Appeals Court agreed with him . \n“To automatically require every tenant to escrow her entire withheld rent payment dilutes the very remedy the implied warranty establishes,” wrote the court. “Such an inflexible requirement potentially creates a new dilemma for impoverished tenants to (1) use their rent money to seek new housing or to remediate the condition or its deleterious effect and be prevented from countersuing or defending against the landlord, or (2) continue to pay or escrow their rent and live in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in order to pursue the claim in court.” \nThe appeals court immediately sent the case to the Missouri Supreme Court and on Wednesday, Camp will argue Johnson’s case. The resulting decision will affect thousands of low-income renters across the state, Camp says, either evening the playing field with landlords or making it easier to begin the process that ends with people like Johnson on the street. \n“If you have a contract, that contract is binding,” Johnson says. “Both parties have to uphold it. What’s the difference between me not holding up my end of the bargain and them not holding up theirs? If I don’t hold up my end of the bargain, I get put out.” \nJohnson is living in the city of St. Louis now. She takes a bus to her job. She’s trying to save enough money to get out of transitional housing and into her own apartment again. Her daughter is tired of moving, Johnson says. She has high hopes for her moment before the Missouri Supreme Court, and she hopes that with its ruling, the court answers an important question. \n“Who is the justice really for?” Johnson asks. “Is it just for people with money or is it for everyone?” By Tony Messenger St. Louis Post-Dispatch 8 hrs ago", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:12:36.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
