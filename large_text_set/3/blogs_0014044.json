Share this video   \nThis adorable baby was born with such long locks that his huge quiff could be seen in his ultrasound scan. \nLittle Oliver Dunn shocked medical staff not only in the womb but also after his birth when he came out with a full head of hair. \nEver since, it's continued to grow an inch a month and now at five-months old it stands at an impressive five inches tall. \nAmused parents Angie and Brian Dunn, 33 and 32, from Nampa in Idaho, say people are besotted with his 'do and constantly try to touch his tufts. \nDespite combing and wetting his head, his parents say nothing will stop the rebellious quiff from sticking up and say it makes him look like he's been 'permanently electrocuted'.

The tot's quiff was so big, it could even be seen on his ultrasound scan (Photo: Caters News Agency) \n\"Some people have commented that he looks like a baby Chris Farley or like Kevin Bacon in Footloose, which I find really funny. \n\"Whenever we're out in public, his hair is the first thing people notice about him, nobody can believe how big it is for such a young baby. \n\"It's so puffy and fluffy that everyone wants to touch it and think it's really cute, fortunately Oliver doesn't mind and is really smiley. \n\"No one can believe his age when we tell them, they often think he's much older because he is such a tiny little guy with such a lot of hair.\" Read More Oliver's hair has grown an inch every month since he was born (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nOliver's massive mop has always drawn attention even during the ultrasound and straight after he was delivered. \nAngie said: \"The first time we realised was during an ultrasound, when my doctors said 'wow, he has a lot of hair.' \n\"But even I was surprised how much hair he had when he was born, all the doctors, nurses were shocked because he had a tonne of it. \n\"Even people from other wards were coming into the room just to see his hair.\" Proud parents Angie and Brian with their son (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nAngie maintains she uses no hairspray or product and that his hair is naturally very voluminous. \nShe said: \"I don't use any oils to help grow his hair, I just use regular baby shampoo and that's it. \n\"After giving him a bath, I brush his hair down but it pops back up by the time it's dried. \n\"There's nothing you can do to make his hair lie down.\" \nOliver's hair is increasing an inch a month and has quicker growth-rate than some adults. \nThis means he will desperately need a haircut before reaching six-months-old.
