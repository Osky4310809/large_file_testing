Tonight’s episode was a somewhat-cerebral reminder of that. So, in what felt like a pettiness-detox, KJo decided to call celebrities from his own hood: directors Kabir Khan, Imtiaz Ali and Zoya Akhtar. Intricacies of the craft were discussed, shocking Bollywood practices were revealed (“Most actors don’t read the scripts”) and critics were slammed for getting a tad too personal in their viral reviews. For the first time this season, KWK followed a non-promotional, real conversation-endorsing format, probably in response to the flak that it has been receiving lately from all quarters (read the Internet). \nAnd … it was meh . Admit it, KWK has spoilt us. In the absence of the usual suspects of the show – the snarky comments, the sexual innuendos and the insinuations – the show didn’t feel much like itself. As much as it sounds regressive, the show is at its most entertaining when it allows itself to be it’s fun, frivolous and often scandalous self. Nevertheless, we fought hard to pull out few gems from the show that may appeal to your highbrow humour, so here you are. Please sip on jasmine tea while perusing and don’t forget to put your reading glasses on because KWK got se-ruh-ous. 1. Zoya Akhtar is apparently the seductress of KWK. The belle of the ball, as KJO addressed her, is desired by most directors in the industry. 2. The directors had a totally relatable discussion about lip-syncing and how it doesn’t make sense, at all, but admitted to succumbing to the practise at some point. 3. When Zoya revealed that her secret to surviving rejections was to be cocky! 4. When the directors shared this disturbing fact: Most actors in Bollywood don’t read scripts. 5. When Kabir Khan attempted to explain the concept of pre-Friday and post-Friday films and busted an unnamed producer’s success formula on national T.V. 6. When all directors high-key threw shade at movie critics for being far too mean and had a 5-minute rant session dedicated to dissing the system. 7. When Zoya fiercely labelled the critics in India as “really lowbrow, supremely pathetic”. 8. Zoya couldn’t fathom the feedback for her movie, Dil Dhadkne Do , that said that she only makes movies about rich people. “How can you critique the economic strata of a movie?” Karan who has been at the receiving end of similar criticism, all through his career, was seen chiming in instantly. 9. When all the four directors couldn’t wrap their heads around “Live Tweets” and debunked the popularity around it as straight-up piracy. 10. When Zoya Akhtar, despite being Javed Akhtar’s firstborn, failed terribly at Urdu translations. 11. And our favourite, when in one of the many Koffee quizzes, KJO’s question, “Name three films where SRK’s name was Rahul”, was met with a dead silence from the three directors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:25:10.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
