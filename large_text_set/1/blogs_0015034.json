On day two, Republicans will start printing laws the way you print fliers for a homecoming dance,” Moore said. “Before the liberals and the Democrats can get their heads screwed on straight, they’ll have 20 laws passed. Building a wall. Creating a Muslim ban. He’s shown how he’s going to do it.” \nMoore added that Americans should take Trump at his word, explaining that it’s one of the reasons he was able to correctly predict Trump’s win and Hillary Clinton’s loss. \n“I’ve taken him literally and seriously since day one. That’s why I’ve been able to be active and energized since the election. I went through my five stages of grief months and months ago when I realized he was going to win,” Moore explained. “You do have to take Trump at his word. I still hear people say, ‘Oh, he’s not really going to build the wall.’ Oh, he is going to build it. He knows that he’s got to deliver at least a version of the wall.” \nBuilding a wall on the southern U.S.-Mexico border was one of Trump’s earliest and strongest campaign promises that he maintained through the Republican primaries and the general election. Although he vowed in the beginning that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, Trump has since conceded that U.S. taxpayers will likely have to foot the bill, with possible reimbursement from Mexico coming later. \nBanning Muslims from immigrating to the U.S. was one of Trump’s most controversial campaign statements. He initially made the promise in December 2015 shortly after two Islamic terrorists slaughtered 14 people in San Bernardino, California. \nHowever, Trump and his senior campaign staffers later softened their rhetoric on the issue and haven’t spoken much about it since his election victory. Still, Trump administration officials say they will continue to look at limiting immigration from countries that traditionally produce terrorists or are terrorism hotbeds, including many countries in the Middle East, South East Asia and North and East Africa. \nDuring his interview with Variety, Moore also explained that he’s “absolutely” concerned by the fact that Trump will have access to America’s nuclear launch codes. \n“I wish he had to go through a psychological evaluation, because I’m pretty sure that it would come out that he is a malignant narcissist,” Moore claimed of Trump. \nMoore made headlines shortly before last year’s presidential election because he was very critical of Clinton’s campaign, saying that she and the Democratic Party were ignoring middle-America, which Moore said was exactly the reason Trump would win the election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T17:14:03.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
