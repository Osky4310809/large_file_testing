The show somehow manages to stay true to — and expand upon — the books’ source material. View this image ›\nSyfy / Carole Segal/Syfy The show, based on Lev Grossman’s Magicians Trilogy , gives us all the big moments and characters from the books, as well as new plots and characters. They’ve made room for fascinating cast additions like Marina, Top Bitch in New York, who will hopefully give the show a shelf-life well beyond the source material.\nID: 8150294 3. The show’s not shying away from the darkness of the books. If anything, it’s even scarier. View this image ›\nSyfy The Dean’s fate after his run-in with The Beast? Alice’s poor brother? These things were scary on paper, but the show’s visuals are straight-up horrifying.\nID: 8150260 4. The central villain, The Beast, has been executed perfectly. His head is LITERALLY INSECTS. View this image ›\nSyFy INSECTS, MAN.\nID: 8150341 5. Honestly, all the creatures are terrifying. Syfy\nSyfy\n Niffins and fox gods and inescapable death, oh my.\nID: 10266331 6. The show tactfully tackles issues of mental health and medication. View this image ›\nSyfy From the very first episode, mental health and medication are integral parts of the story, making the show feel more refreshingly honest. Magicians author Lev Grossman has written about his own journey with both in the past.\nID: 10266099 7. The show also (briefly) addresses sexual violence — and will continue to do so in Season 2. View this image ›\nSyfy “What Lev does, and what we kind of inherited and what we get to do in this show, is to get real with these stories and to talk about what the human truth of these stories is,” showrunner Sera Gamble told The Hollywood Reporter after the finale aired.\nID: 10266655 8. Actor Jason Ralph’s character is all of us. View this image ›\nSyfy / Via arirsw.tumblr.com His portrayal of Quentin Coldwater is appropriately sardonic, insecure, and occasionally frustrating. Every fantasy nerd who’s ever had trouble growing up and coming to terms with the real world will relate to him on a spiritual level.\nID: 8150263 9. Olivia Taylor Dudley nails the whole quiet, withdrawn brilliance thing. View this image ›\nSyfy Nothing about her character Alice’s shy awkwardness is forced, and it’s easy to believe she’s the most brilliant Magician at Brakebills.\nID: 8150346 10. And both are really nailing the whole friendship-turned-romance thing. View this image ›\nSyfy / Via nospaup.tumblr.com The chemistryyy.\nID: 8150445 11. Stella Maeve is giving us the perfect amount of steel and vulnerability. View this image ›\nSyfy / Carole Segal / Syfy She’s the perfect Fortinbras to Quentin’s Hamlet, except, thankfully, she gets way more stage time.\nID: 8150379 12. Hale Appleman (Eliot) and Summer Bishil (Margo) are so wickedly delightful together, they deserve their own reality TV show spin-off. View this image ›\nSyfy / Via naughty-strawberry.tumblr.com Someone put them in a tropical setting with nothing but their combined wits, some alcohol, and a few greased up shirtless men. Would click, would share.\nID: 8150267 13. The Magicians has the cutest bromance ever. View this image ›\nSyfy / Carole Segal/Syfy Sure, it gets kinda weird later on, but Eliot and Quentin are the perfect odd couple for most of the first season.\nID: 8151421 14. Arjun Gupta (Penny) is just…really hot. View this image ›\nSyfy / Via serenelyandwithcomposure.tumblr.com He’s also doing a great job with the series’ very different take on Penny, but let’s also just acknowledge that fact that he’s super babely.\nID: 8150283 15. Like, really super hot. View this image ›\nSyfy / Eike Schroter/Syfy Helloooo.\nID: 8150315 16. Almost as hot as Kady (Jade Tailor). View this image ›\nSyfy Kady is a fantastic non-book addition to the series, and she’s a delight to watch.\nID: 8150286 17. And the two of them together, good lord. View this image ›\nSyfy / Carole Segal/Syfy ID: 8150320 18. There’s a scene in which two characters transform into foxes and have sex for the first time. View this image ›\nSyfy Seriously.\nID: 8150350 19. The Brakebills sets are gorgeous, especially the Physical Kids’ cottage. View this image ›\nSyfy / Via drunkmagnus.tumblr.com It’s like Town and Country meets Hogwarts.\nID: 8150488 20. The finger tutting is actually remarkably cool. View this image ›\nSyfy / Via brakebillskids.tumblr.com In place of wands, Brakebills students conjure magic with complex hand and finger movements. It’s neat and you will 100% try to copy them.\nID: 8150493 21. Julia and Quentin have a complex friendship that isn’t based solely on romance. View this image ›\nSyfy / Via itismultifandom.tumblr.com The longtime best friends definitely have some sexual tension early on, but they deal with some deep shit pretty fast: jealousy, betrayal, dishonesty, and, ultimately, using magic to try and destroy one another.\nID: 8151837 22. Season 2 takes place in a magical land and it looks frackin’ amazing. So please binge-watch the first season ASAP and come back so we can talk about it.
