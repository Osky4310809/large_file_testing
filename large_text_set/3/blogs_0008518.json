The researchers found that women and people in relationships were overrepresented in this group. \n12.7 percent fell into what the researchers call the \"highly distressed non-compulsive” group. That group had low compulsivity and intensity scores but high levels of emotional distress after viewing porn. They watched for an average of 17 minutes per week. \nThe third group, which comprised 11.8 percent of the total respondents, fell into the \"compulsive” profile, meaning they averaged 110 minutes of porn-watching per week and reported high levels of compulsivity and and intensity but moderate levels of distress. \nWhile the results certainly are interesting, convenience sampling is often used to gather preliminary data and examine any trends without having to use a randomized sample, which tends to be more complicated and costly for most researchers. The biggest criticism of convenience sampling, though, is that the sample won’t be representative, meaning there’s no way to really generalize these results to the general population. That said, the researchers were looking to better examine in what kind of context porn might present a problem for people and were able to conclude from this study that for most people, porn probably doesn’t cause any issues when it comes to their overall well-being. So if you’re at all worried about your habits, you can relax — most likely, your viewing preferences are totally normal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:23:13.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
