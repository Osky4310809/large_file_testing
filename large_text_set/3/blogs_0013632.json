AFP \nMONTREAL, Canada — A blizzard moving north from the United States caused car pileups and school closures, and left six dead as heavy snow and powerful winds paralyzed eastern Canada on Wednesday. \nTwo men were found frozen to death in their snow-covered car outside of Quebec City. One of them had called emergency services for help late Tuesday but officials on snowmobiles were unable to reach them in time. \nTwo other motorists were killed in collisions on icy roads as blowing snow reduced visibility, and a 58-year old man died when he was struck by a snow plow.

Snow-clearing equipment was overwhelmed, leaving firefighters to rescue people trapped in cars throughout the region. \nThe main highway between Toronto and Montreal remained closed after a 30-vehicle collision on Tuesday. \nThe driver of an overturned truck carrying hydrofluoric acid died in the crash and several others were treated for exposure to the toxic spill. \nThe scenes at area airports were also chaotic as passengers tried to re-book thousands of flights canceled the previous day.
