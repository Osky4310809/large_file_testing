We didn’t have that many different ideas to get through their defence, but what they did they were doing well. \n“I didn’t see them as much in my half – they focused on defending and dealt (with us) really well. They will hope for a crazy game at their ground but we have to be there from the first minute and play our game to go to the next round.

We just need to get some goals. We have to go through clearly – that’s our aim.” \nMignolet returned between the sticks for Liverpool's visit to Old Trafford on Sunday but Karius is expected to start again in the FA Cup after also playing in the League Cup semi-final first leg defeat by Southampton. \nThat was Liverpool's last visit to the south coast, and Jurgen Klopp will be hoping for a more successful outing against Argyle. poll loading Will Liverpool beat Plymouth in the FA Cup replay? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T18:42:01.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
