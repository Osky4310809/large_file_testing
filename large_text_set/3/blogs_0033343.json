Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Spor Mar 30, 2017 at 5:02p ET 0Shares \nAfter 33 games in the Swedish Hockey League, Minnesota Wild prospect Joel Eriksson Ek is back. \nThe former first-round pick got a taste of the NHL earlier this year, and spent the first nine games of the season with the Wild before being loaned back to his SHL club. More Wild coverage Wild recall St. Paul native Alex Stalock \nBut after adding a bit more muscle over in Sweden, head coach Bruce Boudreau says the 20-year-old is ready for another shot. \n“From what I gathered from everything everybody said, he did a great job over in Europe and he’s gotten bigger, and he’s stronger already I think,” Boudreau said Thursday, ahead of a game against the Ottawa Senators. \nA versatile forward, Eriksson Ek scored eight goals (16 points) in 25 games for Farjestad BK back in Sweden, adding three goals and three assists in seven playoff games. \nBoudreau says Eriksson Ek has add some muscle to his 6-foot-2 frame, and is up to 205 pounds after being listed at 197 pounds during his first stint in the NHL. \n“He’s just a meat-and-potatoes kind of player, and he can play left wing or center, which is good,” Boudreau said. \nBut while Eriksson Ek will be available Thursday, veteran forward Zach Parise is likely to miss at least one more game after being hit in the face with a stick earlier this week. \nThat doesn’t mean he isn’t pushing to play though. \n“I’m waiting for him to come in and ask me to play tonight, quite frankly,” Boudreau said. “He looked okay, which is great news for us, that the injury to his eye and his upper body wasn’t as bad as we had thought at the beginning.” \nBut would Boudreau let him? \n“I don’t know. I’d say ‘let me talk to [GM Chuck Fletcher].’ I’d throw it right on him.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:26:26.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
