The first part of the saga will be released for Android and many other platforms on April 18 for the price of $4.99.\nSee also: Best games with gamepad support for Android November 1, 2016 The developer has also released a new screenshot from the game, and it looks like Star-Lord, Drax and Groot will be fighting against the mad Titan Thanos. Telltale is still keeping the game’s story under wraps, saying only that it involves the Guardians finding “an artifact of unspeakable power” after an epic battle.\nTelltale will also release the first gameplay trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy this Thursday, March 30 around noon Eastern Time. As we have mentioned before, the game is based on the comic book incarnation of the team, and not directly based on the movie versions of the team or its characters. However, the first episode is being released just a few weeks before the movie sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, hits theaters on May 5.\nTelltale is also still busy with a second episodic game series based on a comic: The Walking Dead – A New Frontier. Episode Three of this five-part series is being released for other platforms but so far this section has not made its Android debut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:17:12.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
