The cited section and schedule in the ACJA require that every charge must include the date, year, and location of the commission of the offence for which the accused is being charged. \n“When it comes to the specificity of time of the commission of an offence, there is no provision for the term ‘diverse dates’ either in Section 196(1) or in second schedule of ACJA 2015. \n“Secondly, Section 43 of CAP C38 requires that an accused person can no longer be tried for treason and related felonies after two years from the stated date of commission of the offence. \n“Without a specific date of commission of the offence, how then can the prosecution prove that two years have not elapsed as at the time of commencement of this case in Justice Binta’s court? \n“In addition to dismissing these three counts, we urge Justice Binta Murtala Nyako to indict, convict and jail the prosecution for committing a crime punishable under Section 118 of CAP C38. \nThey warned that should Justice Binta Nyako refuse to dismiss count four, IPOB would base its argument for the continuation of the charge on Section 379(5) of CAP C38, insisting that the court must grant them the rights to subpoena everyone linked to the charge, in line with the argument of IPOB.
