John Lewis (D-GA), who expressed his fervent opposition to the AHCA in extremely impassioned remarks. \n“We cannot abandon our principles,” the civil rights icon bellowed. “Mr. Speaker, we cannot forget our values. I’ve fought too hard and too long to back down now. I will fight any bill that turns the clock back to a darker time.” \nHe added, “Mr. Speaker, I will fight every day, every hour, every minute, and every second! I oppose this bill with every breath and every bone in my body!” \nHeading into today’s vote, NBC News claimed that there were 34 GOP House members who had stated they would vote no on the bill. Also, it was reported that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan told the president today he doesn’t have the votes to get the bill passed. \nWatch the clip above, via MSNBC. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:24:41.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
