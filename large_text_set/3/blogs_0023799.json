The Musketeers mounted a 9-0 run in the last 2:40 of clock time, after they fell eight points down a few minutes earlier. Xavier’s closing run followed a 12-0 run the other direction, which appeared to win the game for Zona.\nAllonzo Trier nearly won the game for Arizona in the final 10 seconds. But Trier’s three-pointer rimmed out, and the Musketeers drained the clock from there.\nX gives it to ya one more time! #Sweet16 pic.twitter.com/NhtVAZb05m\n— NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) March 24, 2017 The Musketeers advanced to the Elite Eight. They’ll face the West region’s No. 1 seed, Gonzaga, in a game on Saturday in San Jose. It’ll be the Musketeers’ third Elite Eight appearance, after they appeared in 2004 and 2008. A win would land Chris Mack’s program in the Final Four for the first time in the history of the program.\nIt’s the second year in a row that Xavier’s been involved in one of the tournament’s most dramatic games. Last year, the Musketeers were on the wrong end of a Bronson Koenig buzzer-beater that sent Wisconsin to the Sweet 16. This will taste better.\nThe second half on Thursday night was a seesaw. Xavier led by four points with seven minutes on the clock. Arizona fought back, led by sophomore guard Trier, and went up eight just more than three minutes later. Xavier came all the way back to grab a 73-71 lead in the last minute. There would be no more points.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/marchmadness/status/845135306420469762", "https://t.co/NhtVAZb05m", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sweet16?src=hash"], "published": "2017-03-24T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T08:04:56.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
