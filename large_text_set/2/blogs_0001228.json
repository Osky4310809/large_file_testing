Rowling \nJ.K. Rowling is fighting fire with SAVAGE INTERNET BURNS. \nThe Harry Potter author has made no secret of her disdain for Donald Trump , and has regularly roasted President Tiny Hands on Twitter whenever he does something stupid (So, you know… a LOT). \nOf course, not everyone has taken a liking to the writer's criticisms of the predatory POTUS, and Trump's supporters are responding in a very Trump approved way. \nRelated: Rowling Just Crushed Your Cursed Child Dreams! \nBy burning all their Harry Potter books, obviously! \nAfter receiving tweets from a lynch mob of fans claiming to torch their Potter -verse merch, the 51-year-old responded to the book burners by pointing out how ridiculous they were being: \nWell, the fumes from the DVDs might be toxic and I've still got your money, so by all means borrow my lighter. pic.twitter.com/kVoi8VGEoK — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 31, 2017 \nHa! \nThe best of Rowling's retorts was directed at a self-proclaimed fan of 17 years, who, according to the author, missed the entire point of the Potter series: \nGuess it's true what they say: you can lead a girl to books about the rise and fall of an autocrat, but you still can't make her think. pic.twitter.com/oB7Aq6Xz8M — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 1, 2017 \nThese expert clap backs might be due to the fact that this isn't the first time Rowling's hit series was threatened with book burning. Back in 2001, Christian groups organized mass Potter burns in protest, claiming the novels were satanic. \nRelated: Rowling-Approved Harry Potter Quiz Reveals Your Patronus! \nBut even when virtually burning her haters, Rowling still exudes kindness more than she has to! \nAs evidenced by her tweets, she took the extra time to post the comments as attached photos, and blurred out the trolls' Twitter handles so her army of fans won't viciously attack them for going after the magical mastermind! \nThe moral of this story? People really need to read between the lines — and don't try to outsmart J.K. Rowling on Twitter. \n[ Image via Lia Toby/ WENN . ] Famous People Who Fist Fight!
