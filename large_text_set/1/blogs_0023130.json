The only thing the 4-2-3-1 shape has encouraged is constant movement and a high tempo simply because Juve's best players love to attack with abandon. As soon as the Bianconeri regain possession, they all look to exploit the gaps at the top, overwhelming the opponent and dragging defenders away to create even more space for the others. \nJuventus are only ever successful when their players keep moving, but on too many occasions this season, we have seen them play a static type of football, with Miralem Pjanic looked upon for answers -- ones he struggled to provide. \nPlaying in a deeper role, the Bosnia international is putting his technique on the ball to great use, ensuring possession and vertical passes going forward. With Dybala allowed to stay further up field rather than retreating in search of possession, Pjanic too looks more effective. The only problem is that Juve are still not making the most of their superiority, having squandered some brilliant goal-scoring opportunities in their last two matches. \nAgainst Sassuolo, it seems Allegri will opt for the new formation again. But on this occasion, Marko Pjaca may start ahead of Juan Cuadrado on the right. The Croatia international -- as we all have witnessed -- is blessed with audacious talent and technique. But according to Allegri, a man who took his time to introduce Alvaro Morata and Dybala to the starting lineup, Pjaca has yet to learn how to suffer. \nJuventus and Serie A is a step up from Dinamo Zagreb, and with his old side, Pjaca was the star, the man his teammates looked to on the pitch. At Juventus, he's simply another player who must work hard to unleash the talent of those around him. It will take time, but Allegri is certain Pjaca has what it takes to prove important for the second part of the season. \nSassuolo are a difficult team to face, especially at home, and Allegri hopes his side can walk away with three points. Often deployed in a 4-3-3 formation that turns into something resembling a 4-5-1 when not in possession, Sassuolo are a team that loves to attack via the wings and score goals from open play. As such, should Pjaca start, he will need to remain aggressive and alert, pressing relentlessly to peg back the opponents. \nHowever, it will be Alex Sandro and Mario Mandzukic on the left who must remain highly alert and defensively cautious, as they will face Domenico Berardi, a player who so often inspires the team to victories. His pace and talent have earned him attention from the best clubs in the world, including Juventus , and he will try to impact the game as much as possible. \nAway from home, the Old Lady has suffered, and Sassuolo have been known to spring a surprise. If they manage to make the most of their chances and remain alert for the entirety of the game, Juventus can achieve an important win away from home. \nMina Rzouki covers Juventus and the Italian national team for ESPN FC.
