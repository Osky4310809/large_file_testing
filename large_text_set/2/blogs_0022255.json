Few items are more important to that foundation than underwear and undershirts.\nTommy John 's roots are actually in undershirts. Founder and CEO Tom Patterson was frustrated he couldn’t find an undershirt that suited his needs. He wanted one that would fit flush with his body without riding up or showing through his dress shirt, so he decided to make his own. He found the right materials, made some shirts, and a few trials later, Tommy John was born.\nFrom there, Tommy John expanded into other clothing categories, including workout gear, loungewear, socks, and underwear. The guys of the Insider Picks team recently got the chance to try out Tommy John's underwear .\nHere's what we thought:\nTommy John Instagram\nTyler Lauletta, commerce reporter:\nIn my time writing about underwear on the internet, I have long held that MeUndies makes the most comfortable pairs of underwear I’ve ever worn. I still stand by that, but there are more things than comfort that go into making a great pair of underwear, and this is where my Tommy John boxer briefs excelled.\nWith great movement and support, they make for a great undergarment for when you know you’re going to have an active day. On days when I have a big walk or workout planned, Tommy John is the best choice I have in my dresser drawer.\nBrandt Ranj, commerce reporter, tech:\nTommy John’s underwear walks that fine line between form-fitting and comfortable. Their material is very soft, and while the boxer briefs don’t leave a whole lot of room, I didn’t mind too much.\nIn most cases, I’ve had to choose between comfortable underwear with a funky design, or a contemporary look with a worse material. Tommy John’s boxer briefs have the best of both worlds; they’re quickly becoming one of my go-to pairs of underwear, and they look more professional than other underwear I own.\nBreton Fischetti, senior director, commerce:\nI found Tommy John's product to be very comfortable, if a little thin for my taste. My favorite model was the 360 Torque Trunk . I thought the pocket was a little silly at first, but I've used it to keep some cash with me when I'm on a run or traveling in a foreign country, just in case. It's a much more elegant solution than some of those bulky and unfortunate-looking travel wallets I've seen in the wild.\nI also liked their undershirts, they were tight without being restrictive and very soft.\nTommy John\nHaving just started the new year, it’s a good time to think about refreshing your dresser with the items you probably wear the most, but think about the least.\nPersonally, I know that I hold on to socks, undershirts, and underwear too long, unless I take proactive steps to make sure I’m keeping my wardrobe updated. If you’re in need of a few fresh undergarments for 2017, or are looking for pairs of underwear that can handle your resolution to hit the gym three times a week, Tommy John is a great option for you.\nYou can check out Tommy John’s underwear here , or see all the company has to offer here.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
