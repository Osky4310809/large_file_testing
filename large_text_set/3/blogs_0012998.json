I was floating. I don’t fall. Shit, nothing happened. Floating is amazing. It’s like getting in a plane. I just flew, man. I’m a magician, like David Blaine. I could never fall. Drake is an amazing person. Also, a magician. He’s a big brother, super-talent, he’s cool.” \nScott also spoke about his upcoming project Astroworld , sounding completely committed to the concept that he has discussed several times before: \n“The next record is called ‘AstroWorld’. It might be the best music that I made. I have two records on the album that are like, man, they are the best. They tore down ‘AstroWorld’ to build more apartment space. That’s what it’s going to sound like, like taking an amusement park away from kids. We want it back. We want the building back. That’s why I’m doing it. It took the fun out of the city.” \nIn other Travis Scott news, he also unleashed his Birds In The Trap short film Monday night (March 13), which can be watched via Apple Music . \n“With close to a billion album streams and a top ten most streaming album of all-time with Apple, we feedin’ the streets again TONIGHT!” he wrote in the caption to a clip on Instagram. \nJUST ANNOUNCED. @trvisXX #BirdsInTheTrap short film.Tonight: 9pm PT/12am ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T06:00:46.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
