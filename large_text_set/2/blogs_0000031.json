Ruby Rose thinks it can be. \nIn Cosmopolitan’s March issue, the Orange is the New Black star shares why she feels marriage is more about equal rights than the act itself. \n“When you don’t have equal rights, it trickles down to kids who think, ‘My aunt’s gay so she can’t get married, or I’m weird because I feel the same way,’” she said. “So it’s important to break down that barrier. I’m more interested in having a loving, healthy, long-term relationship with someone I might want to have kids with someday.” \nHear that, ladies? \nActress Ruby Rose in Cosmopolitan's March issue. (Photo: Ben Watts, Cosmopolitan) \nThe Australian actress and model, who is known in part for her androgynous style and gender fluidity , also said she feels blessed to be confident and in tune with her sexuality, noting how that can be difficult for people in different places around the world. \n“I’m lucky I can explore,” she said. “I have a very healthy sex life, and there’s something very empowering, strong and feminist about being open and comfortable in that world.” \nAnother place she seems to feel open and comfortable is on social media . \nShe explained that she’s always going to be vocal online about things like LGBTQ and animal rights, but knows she's another voice amongst other opinions. \n“I have a platform and I can open up a dialogue, but I also know that I’m just an actor. I’m just another person with an option no better than anyone else’s opinion,” she said. “I don’t overanalyze. I just write from the heart, post it and hope for the best.” \nRose's cover issue is on newsstands Feb. 7.
