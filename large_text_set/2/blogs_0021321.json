According to a report by Factor Daily, the company could launch its taxi service within this year, and it has already ordered about 600 cars to kickstart the service. \nAs per the report, Ambani’s taxi service could be called Reliance Jio cabs. The launch of the service will reportedly depend on the commercial launch of the Jio telecom service, which will start on April 1st when the telco will start charging for its services that have been free since September last year. The company is planning to launch the taxi service after April, but it might take up to six months more depending how the commercial rollout plans out. \nThe brand will reportedly compete in the taxi service market with aggressive pricing. It has roped in consulting firm E&Y to come up with pricing strategies, which align with Reliance Industries Chairman Ambani’s plans to “go all out to get market share”, adds the report. \nIt appears that unlike current app-based taxi service giants including Uber and Ola, Reliance Jio will have its own cabs. The brand has allegedly ordered cars for its own fleet from manufacturers like Mahindra and Hyundai, and has placed orders for about 600 cars. “The idea is to operate its own fleet of cars along with independent cab drivers who can attach their cars to the Reliance Jio Cabs network,” reads the report. \nReports indicate that Reliance Industries is planning to give a stiff competition to Uber and Ola with Jio Cabs. The company will reportedly launch the services first in Bengaluru and Chennai, followed by a launch in Delhi and Mumbai. The service will have an Uber-like app, and its development is already underway. The brand is purportedly still exploring the payment system for the drivers, and is likely to use Jio Money, its own mobile wallet. The service is expected to offer free Wi-Fi to the riders via Jio’s network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:33:54.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
