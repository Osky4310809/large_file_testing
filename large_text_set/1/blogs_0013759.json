Share Mark Gatiss as Mycroft Holmes (Photo: BBC) Share Get celebs   Thank you for subscribing!   \nWhatever Mark Gatiss did in last night’s Sherlock finale he was never going to top his eye-catching, three-minute cameo as a bloated, foul-mouthed George IV the previous evening. \nLikewise, Sherlock itself was never going to shake my belief that its BBC1 unstablemate Taboo, in which Tom Hardy stars as a brooding, grunting, vengeful 19th century shipping company boss/suspected crazy cannibal, is TV’s best drama right now. \nSherlock will still grab all the headlines and the fangirling on social media, but surely I can’t be the only viewer who preferred it when Holmes and Watson were just solving fairly believable mysteries. If it went back to that I’d welcome another series or two with open arms. \nHowever, if the BBC decided to spend its drama budget on something else instead, dipping back into the Taboo end of the market would be a good start.
