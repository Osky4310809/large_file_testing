Whole eggs are one of the least expensive, highest-quality proteins on the planet. Though once demonized due to their high cholesterol, better science now shows that dietary cholesterol has no effect on overall blood cholesterol. So go to town on these 8 fatty foods that have health benefits . And don’t believe restaurants and “experts” who say egg whites are heart healthy and that whole eggs are not. 2/6 Shutterstock #2: Non- or low-fat packaged foods Fat helps your body absorb nutrients. So when you buy a bottle of non-fat salad dressing, you’re actually consuming fewer nutrients from the greens than if you were to use a little olive oil. Plus, admit it: Non-fat dressing tastes terrible. 3/6 Shutterstock #3: Full-carb snacks Crackers, cereal bars, pretzels–these foods offer little nutrition beyond a measly gram of so of fiber, at most. Swap these for snacks that include stomach-filling protein and/or better fiber numbers. Nuts, jerky, apples, cheese, Greek yogurt, berries, and cottage cheese are all good picks. 4/6 Shutterstock #4: Peanut butter I have a “friend” who can sit with a jar in hand and mindlessly feed himself spoonful after spoonful of the stuff. Yes, peanut butter (and almond butter, and cashew butter) offers a great source of heart-healthy fats, but PB calories can pile up fast. Limit yourself to two spoonfuls. Then close up the jar and back away. If this seems impossible, give any of the popular powdered peanut butters a try. 5/6 Shutterstock #5: Energy bars Many of them are nothing more than fortified candy bars—sometimes with more calories. Yes, they’re convenient, but think about packing your snack bag with more nutritious non-perishable options (jerky, nuts, shelf-stable single-serving milks) instead. 6/6 Shutterstock #6: Fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt The word “fruit” should be used loosely. It’s more like sugar on the bottom, as some yogurts can have more added sugar than a soft drink. Instead, stick with plain Greek yogurt and add fresh fruit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T04:18:35.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
