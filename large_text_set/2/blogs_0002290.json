We also know that being a metahuman is a dream come true, at least according to Jessica Camacho, the actress who portrays Reynolds/Gypsy in the Arrowverse. Not only that, Camacho seems to be a big fan of Gypsy's costume on The Flash as well. \n\"Yeah, man, let me tell you it holds you back from reaching for that cupcake at lunch,\" Camacho joked with Comicbook.com. \"You're like 'Maybe I'll just have a couple of almonds instead.' I was so excited! I can't think of very many more exciting experiences as an actor. For me, putting on a superhero suit, being a metahuman, is a dream come true.\" \nWhile Gypsy was only seen briefly at the end of last week's episode in apparent pursuit of Harrison Wells, tonight's episode is set to explore Gypsy more in-depth and see her in action in her full outfit. \n\"When I saw her badassery and her jacket and I suited up for the first time and saw what Gypsy looked like, it was a whole other level of joy and excitement and I just wanted to bring life to that,\" Camacho said. \"I was completely enthralled by it. I will say, a corset may or may not be involved with the jacket, but it’s worth it!” \nThe Flash airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT, followed by DC's Legends of Tomorrow at 9 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:32:05.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
