Of particular concern are the 2 million cars on Norway's roads that are not equipped with Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) receivers, they say. We're the first country to switch off FM but there are several countries going in the same direction Ole Joergen Torvmark, head of Digital Radio Norway \nS ixty-six percent of Norwegians oppose switching off FM, with just 17 percent in favour and the rest undecided, according to an opinion poll published by the daily Dagbladet last month. \nNevertheless, parliament gave the final go-ahead for the move last month, swayed by the fact that digital networks can carry more radio channels. \nSwitzerland plans a similar shift from 2020, and Britain and Denmark are among those also considering such a switch . A smooth transition to DAB, which is already beamed across Norway, could encourage these countries to move ahead. \nThe shutdown of the FM (Frequency Modulation) network, introduced in the 1950s, will begin in the northern city of Bodoe on Jan. 11.

So there is definitely a safety concern,\" he said. \nFor the same cost, digital radio in Norway allows eight times more radio stations than FM. The current system of parallel FM and digital networks, each of which cost about 250 million crowns (£23 million), saps investments in programmes. \nAmong other nations, Britain plans to review the need for a switchover once digital listening reaches 50 percent. That could be reached by the end of 2017 on current trends, Digital Radio UK spokeswoman Yvette Dore said.
