The show featured a slew of talent, including Alabama Shakes , Ben Harper , and Sufjan Stevens . Of all the great moments, one of the most unique came with a collaborative performance by Iggy Pop and New Order members Bernard Sumner , Phil Cunningham and Tom Chapman. \nBacked by the string group Scorchio Quartet, Pop and Bernard opened their set with a performance of New Order’s “Stray Dog” off 2015’s Music Complete . Cunningham and Chapman then joined for Pop’s 1986 track “Shades”, which was Sumner’s personal request. The short set closed with Pop’s own song choice, a cover of Joy Division ’s “She’s Lost Control”, which saw Pop and Bernard trading vocals for what was the evening’s most rocking moment. \nCheck out fan-shot footage of “Stray Dog” and “She’s Lost Control” below. (Security was extremely strict with people taking pictures or filming, hence all the downward angles from the balcony.)

First, the band came out along with Scorchio Quartet and harpist Lavinia Meijer to back Sufjan Stevens on a stunning rendition of his “The Star Spangled Banner”. Later, to cap off Smith’s own closing set, the entire bill — including Smith’s son Jackson, Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes, Harper and his daughter, Pop, Glass, New Order, Laurie Anderson , Tenzin Choegyal , Jesse Paris Smith , Zack Glass, and some Tibetan monks — joined together to perform the classic “People Have the Power”. \nCheck out footage of those performances below.
