'Brutal behaviour' \nThe Palestinian appears to be explaining something and emphasising a point, whereupon the officer headbutts him and slaps him back and forth across the head. \nAs the driver clutches his head and bends over, the policeman knees him in the stomach then punches him on the back of the head. \nAt this point, two more individuals arrive and start remonstrating with the policeman, who shoves one of them backwards. He pushes back at the policeman, who then kicks out at him. \nThe edited video then cuts to a moment where the second man apparently strikes the policeman on the side of the face, before a third man steps in and tries to calm the policeman down. \nThe footage drew outrage from Israeli Arab politicians. Member of the Knesset Ahmad Tibi called for the officer to be arrested and prosecuted. \n\"It is brutal behaviour of mafia and gang members, not people who are responsible for law and order,\" he said. \nIsrael's Public Security Minister, Gilad Erdan, condemned the officer's actions. \n\"There is no place for such behaviour in the [police] force and I hope that the police investigation unit will prosecute him to the full extent of the law,\" he said.
