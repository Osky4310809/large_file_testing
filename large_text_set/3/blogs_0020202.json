She said that trans women, born as men, may not share the same struggles as women. \n“I think if you’ve lived in the world as a man with the privileges the world accords to men, and then switched gender, it’s difficult for me to accept that then we can equate your experience with the experience of a woman who has lived from the beginning in the world as a woman, and who has not been accorded those privileges that men are,” Adichie said at the time . \nAdichie maintained that her position on trans women and women hasn’t changed during her talk at the bookstore. \n“But really, my position remains: I think gender is about what we experience, gender is about how the world treats us, and I think a lot of the outrage and anger comes from the idea that in order to be inclusive, we sometimes have to deny difference,” Adichie went on . \nSend tips to [email protected] .
