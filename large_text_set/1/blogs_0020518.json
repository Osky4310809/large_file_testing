The show, which is being made in partnership with Marvel and is currently being referred to as Untitled Marvel Action-Adventure Series , will follow two parents who are forced to go on the run after they discover their children have mutant abilities. The series is set in a period where the government is hostile toward mutants, and together with other families they meet along the way, the family must do whatever they can to survive. Fox briefly spoke about the show at a recent television conference in Los Angeles, where producer Lauren Shuler Donnner told IGN it would incorporate a version of Sentinels. In the films, Sentinels are mutant-hunting robots that were created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee in X-Men #14 in November 1965. Unlike the Sentinels fans are used to seeing, however, Donner said the television version of the mutants’ adversary would be much smaller in scale. Nix confirmed the show will acknowledge the events of what has transpired in the X-Men film franchise, but won’t fit into any particular period. There’s no word on casting or when the show could potentially air at this time. Fox’s sister network, FX, will premiere Legion , its own X-Men-related series, on Feb. 2.
