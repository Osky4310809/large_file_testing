But for me, it's just something I don't want to get into, and that's a personal choice and hopefully people respect that decision.\" \nMcIlroy initially cited concerns over the Zika virus as the reason behind his withdrawal from the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, but last week he said he has come to \"resent\" the Olympics because he feels torn between two flags. McIlroy is from Northern Ireland, which is a part of Great Britain, but represented Ireland in amateur team competitions. \n\"It's not to say where I'm from is a bad place. Northern Ireland is one of the best places on Earth, and I try to get back there as much as I can,\" he said. \"But again, it's a personal decision and it's a decision I haven't taken lightly and a decision I've fought myself over for so many years.\" \nMcIlroy garnered headlines last summer at The Open when discussing his Olympic withdrawal, and he admitted that in hindsight that news conference may have included \"one question too many.\" \n\"I maybe said something off the cuff that went a little too far, but it was always in there. It was always there in the back of my mind, and that day it came to the front of my mind and I sort of let it go,\" he said. \"I think golf in the Olympics is a great thing, and it went so good last year and I hope it goes even better in 2020. I just probably won't be a part of it.\" Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:31:45.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
