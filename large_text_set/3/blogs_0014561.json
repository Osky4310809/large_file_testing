It's me. I'm stalking people and drunk tweeting all up in your Twitter feed.\nYes, Adele has reportedly fessed up to the fact that she runs her own top-secret Twitter profile, after her management team banned her from \"drunk tweeting\" on the official Adele account . Have you ever heard of anything so quintessentially Adele?\nWell, if you've been following her dirty-joke-telling , Elmo-meeting , hiding-in-a-box and fending off mosquitoes shenanigans Down Under the past few days, then yes, you probably have. But this takes the cake.\nThe obvious question everyone wants answered is: Where is this magical, uncensored Adele account?\nSEE ALSO: Adele invites drag impersonator on stage to belt tunes and take selfies\nIt's been long-established that Adele was banned from tweeting directly from her own account. In 2015, she explained to the BBC : \"I mean I'm not a drinker any more, but when Twitter first came out I was, like, drunk tweeting, and nearly put my foot in it quite a few times.\"\n\"So my management decided that you have to go through two people and then it has to be signed off by someone, but they're all my tweets. No-one writes my tweets. They just post them for me. So, yeah, that's very, very true.\"\nThen, at a show Tuesday night in Brisbane, Australia, she said something wonderful. According to the The Sun , the singer told the crowd: \"I was looking on Twitter last night. They don't know I have a secret account. Well obviously they do now because I said that. By 'they' I mean my management.\"\n\"I'm not allowed access to my own Twitter because I'm quite mouthy and I say the wrong thing a lot of the time. So they took that privilege away from me.\"\nSay what?! Adele is just floating around incognito on Twitter, reading everyone's tweets and unnoticed by her 27.9 million followers? This is too much. And fans know it.\nOn a hunt to find adeles secret twitter!
