Chelsea analysis: Hazard makes fools of Arsenal as Alonso shows hunger \n\"Yes, maybe,\" he said after being asked if he is a more well-rounded player than in 2015. \"With experience you get more. I think I'm a better player. But I think we are in better form as a team. It's not just me. \n\"A couple of years ago I was on fire. Maybe I can score more goals this season. Two years ago I finished with maybe 13-14 [it was 19], I don't remember. We have a lot of games to play, we will see. \n\"I try to be this kind of player that when I get the ball I do something. From the moment I get the ball, I try to do something. \n\"Sometimes in the past, I don't touch the ball for 20-30 minutes. But now I try to touch the ball all the time and play my football for my team-mates.
