A quick search of YouTube alone yields turnt-up GT-Rs with 800, 1,200 or even over 2,500 horsepower. Fun fact! This was not what Nissan had in mind when first it sold the car to us.\nJust last week, we saw AMS Performance’s incoherent beast of a GT-R run a quarter mile in 6.937 seconds. That, in drag racing terms, means that it’s a six-second car. Take your ten-second car and get outta here, Dominic Toretto.\n\nThis Nissan GT-R Ran A Quarter Mile In Six Damn Seconds This Nissan GT-R Ran A Quarter Mile In Six Damn Seconds This Nissan GT-R Ran A Quarter Mile In Six Damn… Count to six. That’s how long it takes for AMS Performance’s monstrosity of a Nissan GT-R to run… Read more Read more \nWhen the R35 GT-R first hit our shores in 2008, it quickly rose to stardom the old-fashioned way: by utterly obliterating the competition with straight-line races and blistering lap times, despite being as heavy as a building and costing a fraction of the price of some Italian exotic. The first GT-R was a steal at about $70,000 all while being capable of doing the zero to 60 mph dash in the mid-threes. It was also faster around the Nürburgring than a 911 Turbo. \nAdvertisement \n\nAdvertisement \n\nIn an old Top Gear review, Jeremy Clarkson cricked his neck because the car cornered too hard. Like, what? Sure, he probably wasn’t in the best of shape, but still .\n\nAnd that was what it could do stock .\nLike the Skyline GT-Rs before it, the car would inevitably catch the eye of the tuning community, with gearheads everywhere salivating at the thought of what could be done to that twin-turbo V6 engine. But clearly, Nissan’s engineers had other things in mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:59:55.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
