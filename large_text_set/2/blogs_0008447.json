But discussion about its efficacy as a source was revived in early January when one user led the campaign against the Daily Mail .\nEditor Hillbillyholiday argued during a discussion that the outlet is untrustworthy for science-related stories, inappropriately posts photos of children and has limited credibility even with direct Quote: s and interviews.\nThose opposed could not support a blanket banning but agreed on a comprise: to use the Daily Mail as a source only in limited situations.\nOne user commented with a \"strong oppose\" comment that \"The Daily Mail , as hated as it is, is a very mixed bag. It can contain wonderful information such as accurate and informative interviews with highly respected people.\"\nThe Daily Mail was dragged through the mud on a Wikipedia discussion about its reliability.\nImage: Steve Meddle/REX/Shutterstock\nUltimately, though, the news outlet has been effectively banned as a source, due to its \"reputation for poor fact checking, sensationalism, and flat-out fabrication.\"\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, who runs the main Wiki site, pointed out that the outlet isn't fully banned — its use as a reference is just \"generally prohibited, especially when other more reliable sources exist.” But the key takeaway is that the Daily Mail is no longer a go-to reliable source for citing something on a page.\nThe ruling does not mean the Mail can never be used as a source, but editors are being encouraged to change information that cites the publication to a different source.\nThe Mail joins the National Enquirer among the few outlets that Wikipedia has called out in particular. The Sun and the Daily Mirror are also seen as unreliable . Wikipedia also warns against using state-run media like China's Xinhua or Iran's Press TV as sources.\nAdditional reporting by Jason Abbruzzese.\nBONUS: Even Fox News is defending CNN against Trump", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1pIdUwBbnb3PYQ8SKMOzuMyLAz4=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F377096%2F67ca4b59-f071-4927-a605-9850d29aaae3.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Hillbillyholiday", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/vZJGM3Fv.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Potentially_unreliable_sources", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bkGP266j0lg_UiVmTD0skHSalBA=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F377096%2F67ca4b59-f071-4927-a605-9850d29aaae3.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Daily_Mail_RfC", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Potentially_unreliable_sources&diff=642377260&oldid=642376102", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/vZJGM3Fv.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-09T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:37:26.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
