NO NEED TO RUB IT IN. http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2017/02/27/5839844518771799063/1024x576_MP4_5839844518771799063.mp4 \nJessica happily sang along in the crowd before breaking it down with Justin, glowing like the sun in a metallic dress and making it easy for the crowd to find the couple amongst the chaos. \nWhat IS it about happy celebrity couples that make you cry happy tears and also want to vomit at the same time? \nAnd, DAMN, are these two likeabe?! The two of them goofing around on the red carpet pre-show and Justin telling Ryan Seacrest Jessica’s dress is “perfection” are everything. REX/Shutterstock \nTimberlake finished his performance singing a rendition of “Lovely Day” by Bill Withers, and is a nominee for Best Original Song up against Lin-Manuel Miranda and Auli’i Cravalho’s “How Far I’ll Go” (from “Moana”), Sting’s “The Empty Chair” (from the film “Jim: The James Foley Story”) and “Audition” (“The Fools Who Dream”) and “City of Stars” from crowd favorite, “ La La Land .” \nWeirdly enough, my bowl of ice cream and I shared a similar intimate moment in my apartment Sunday night. Singing together in my living room and looking into one another’s eyes. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:10:39.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
