Carlie has Down syndrome. Can't wait for prom with this sweet gal 🎈😁 pic.twitter.com/z3Lc66YRW3 \n— Shaedon Wedel (@shardonwedel) March 17, 2017 \nIn a video posted to Facebook, Wedel arrives at the Wittmans’ home wearing a T-shirt bearing the words, “I know I’m NACHO typical Dorito but… I’m going to be CHEESY and ask: Will you go to prom with me?” \n“Will you go to prom with me?” Wedel asked in the video as he gave Carlie a bouquet of roses and a bag of Doritos. She happily said “Yes!” \nThe video quickly gained attention online, as did pictures of the promposal Wedel posted on Twitter. \nWedel told KWCH, “Ever since I’ve known her, she’s loved Doritos.” \nWedel said he wasn’t seeking attention when he asked Carlie to prom, but he has enjoyed seeing “positivity coming out of it.” \n“I didn’t do it for the publicity and stuff, I did it to make her happy,” Wedel said. “She deserves a lot.” \nWedel said Carlie has “brought nothing but joy to my life.” \n“Anyone who’s ever around her, she makes them laugh. She always has a smile on her face. She’s amazing,” Wedel said. \nWedel told CBS News that another reason he wanted to ask his best friend Carson’s little sister to prom is because he thinks of the Wittmans as a second family. \n“They have been so kind and nurturing to me,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:25:10.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
