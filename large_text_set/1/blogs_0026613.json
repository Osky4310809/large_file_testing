Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAs I lie on a gaudy, gold-edged king-size bed, seven floors up from the commotion outside, the chants of “no hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here” echo from the TV. \nGetting through crowds of protesters just to check in to room 718 at the new $200million Trump International Hotel in W­ashington DC was a feat in itself. \nOn the 55-inch screen, news channels go on to recap Donald Trump ’s first week in charge, starting with his inaugural speech. “Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families”. \nYet despite his pledge to “Buy ­American and hire American”, a Mirror investigation found nearly everything in his hotel rooms are made by the foreign powers he has viciously accused of cheating the States and stealing US jobs. \nEven his suggestion of imposing a 20% import tax on goods sent from his nemesis Mexico was found to be riddled with hypocrisy after we discovered his hotel’s TVs are made south of the border.

But he failed to mention he was delighted about their TV-making skills. \n“The President has taken credit for stopping companies like Ford moving jobs to Mexico but when it comes to his ­businesses he doesn’t give a f*** – he’ll go ­wherever it is cheapest.” Mirror reporter Chris Bucktin inside the Trump Hotel, where virtually everything was made outside the US (Photo: Daily Mirror) These have unfortunate branding (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nDespite his attacks on China, the rooms, starting at an average of £500 per night, are packed full of items from the country he accused of a “massive theft of intellectual property”. \nFour lamps, two bath robes, a set of bathroom scales, the valet stand and a shower cap are all from the Far East. \nFurther inspection finds sumptuous Italian bed linen, expensive ­Canadian toiletries, fine German Villeroy & Boch porcelain cups, Indian towels, two telephones from Malaysia and a Swiss fridge.

We also found him cashing in on his most hated religion – Islam. \nOpening the bedside drawer I came across a Gideon Bible with a note on hotel stationery: “If you would like to continue your spiritual journey, we also offer the following: Talmud. Quran. Gita. Avesta. Tripitaka (Pali Canon). Shri Guru Granth Sahib. Book of Mormon.” Brass-plated bin, which was made in Britain (Photo: Daily Mirror) The toiletries have regrettable branding (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nA call to ­housekeeping confirmed guests were able to have the holy book of Islam brought to their room in Arabic and English, with a prayer rug and a compass pointing to Mecca. \nIt is clear Trump the President is happy to sign an order temporarily barring ­citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US. \nBut Trump the hotelier welcomes Muslims – if they are loaded with dollars. Despite the President’s campaign and subsequent promise to put “America First” the only US-made things I could find in the room were the crisps and Trump Chocolate Gold Bullion Minis. The towels are made in China (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nThe same could be said for the staff. Most of those I spoke to during my stay had African or Caribbean accents. Even the hotel’s managing director, Mickael Damelincourt is from France. \nLike Trump’s presidency, the hotel is already beset with problems. Democrats are challenging his right to lease the Old Post Office Pavilion, which the hotel occupies, citing a line in the agreement that prohibits elected officials from profiting off a government lease. \nIn 2013, he signed a 60-year lease for the building with the General Services Administration, meaning he is now effectively the building’s landlord. There's a wide range of reading material (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nTrump was criticised before the election over the building of his new hotel, amid claims he relied on undocumented workers – labourers with no legal right to be in the US – to cut costs. The workforce included many Hispanics, including some claiming they were undocumented. \nIt was later discovered that despite his attacks on China, the President had ditched US-made steel in favour of cheaper metal from the Far East. \nHe used Chinese steel and aluminium in the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. It is understood he did not import steel for the refurbishment of the building that hosts his Washington hotel. The bathrobes were also made in China (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nA spokesman for Trump said the company and its contractors followed all ­applicable laws. \nBut his rival Hillary Clinton said: “He’s used undocumented workers; he’s made his products in foreign countries; he’s used Chinese steel instead of American steel, so you can talk a good game, but let’s look at the facts, and the facts show he has stiffed American workers.” \nBut the hotels’ biggest problem may be the damning reviews that helped it lose more a reported $1.1million – £881,000 – in its first two months. Chris with the Mexican television (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nAccording to members-only LTI-Luxury Travel Intelligence, it is one of the world’s worst high-end hotels. Its review states: “This place is not for the true discerning luxury traveller.” \nThe hotel fared little better among everyday travellers. On website Yelp, Austin L, of Berkeley, California, simply said: “Probably the worst hotel experience of my life. The only redeeming trait were the constant protests outside.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:58:39.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
