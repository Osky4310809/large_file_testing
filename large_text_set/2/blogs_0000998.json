Tom Brady. Taylor Swift. Cats. Babies. Golf. The Big Bang Theory . Cilantro. The word ‘moist.’ Skip Bayless. Everything. These are all things that many people don’t just hate, but actively enjoy hating, and would probably be stoked to find and maybe even date other kindred spirits who despise these very same things. Seizing a golden opportunity, a Goldman Sachs expat has developed a new dating app that uses an algorithm to match people by how much they dislike any given topic , reports Mashable . Naturally, it’s called Hater. \nFire up the app and you’ll find 3,000 topics to evaluate, including butt selfies (how could you hate butt selfies?) and bad tippers (this one we understand). You can either swipe up to love or down to hate, and left to dislike or right to like. From there, you’ll be matched with other haters, marry one, and have lots of little baby haters. So far during the beta phase of the app, Hater’s founders said via Mashable that the three most commonly hated topics are the presidential election of 2016, bad sidewalk etiquette, and drain hair, which is indeed awful. The most loved, however, are “my mom,”“the ocean,” and “guacamole,” which are all correct.
