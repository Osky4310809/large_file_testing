Theresa May urged to come clean on investments   11:58 Get short URL Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May © Francois Lenoir / Reuters UK Prime Minister Theresa May is facing calls to reveal her financial interests after it emerged she set up a blind trust of shares when she became prime minister, thought to be worth up to £145,000 ($175,000). \nSuch a trust, which allows May to keep investments while relinquishing management of them, was revealed in a recent Cabinet Office list of ministerial interests. \nA blind trust is controlled by a third party, meaning May will not know when shares are traded and replaced while she is in power.

When asked why, the spokesperson said: “The prime minister has a far wider set of public duties than the home secretary.” \nLast summer, May revealed she had received £5,419 in dividends in 2014-15, a return that suggests the amount invested in her blind trust could run into six figures. \nThe Telegraph reports the blind trust could be worth up to £145,000. \nBlind trusts are a relatively common way for ministers to retain their investments while in office. \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair was heavily criticized by the Tories for using a blind trust to fund his office in opposition.

However, blind trusts were used by many of his ministers, with at least 16 senior politicians keeping their interests in such schemes in 2011. \nLabour shadow cabinet minister Andrew Gwynne has called on May to disclose what she put into the blind trust in the interests of transparency. \nGwynne said if May has “nothing to hide,” she needs to reveal her “existing financial interests.” \n“In not being able to scrutinise the prime minister’s financial affairs it’s not possible to know if they present a conflict of interest with her government responsibilities.” \n“The British people deserve full and proper transparency so they can make their own minds up on whether their politicians are acting in the nation’s interest, rather than their own.” \nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron echoed this sentiment, saying: “I’m sure the prime minister has nothing to hide but the public has a legitimate interest in what companies she invested in and who runs the trust. \n“Theresa May promised the most transparent government in the world. This is an early test to see if her deeds match her words.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T14:04:58.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
