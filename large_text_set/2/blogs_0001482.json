That aligns with our report that multiple analytic providers and social media talent managers saw a big decline in Snapchat usage after Instagram Stories came out . \nWhile we can’t be sure Instagram Stories directly caused the issue, its rapid rise is higly curated with Snapchat’s slow down. \nIn Q1 2016, Snapchat averaged 122 million daily active users, having grown 14% over the past quarter. Then Q2 proved to be its best growth quarter ever, thanks to massive interest in full-screen visual communication and a lack of direct competitors. Snapchat hit 143 million daily users with a wopping 17.2% growth rate. \nBut on August 2nd, Snapchat’s much larger competitor Instagram launched an exact clone of Snapchat Stories at the top of its app used by 300 million people daily and 500 million people each month. By October, the feature had 100 million daily users of its own. Instagram Stories launched on August 2nd, adding an exact copy of Snapchat Stories to the top of the popular Instagram feed \nSuddenly, Snapchat slowed down. It had its lowest percentage growth quarter since the beginning of its publicly available data in 2014. Snapchat grew just 7% in Q3 2016 to reach 153 million daily users. And in Q4 it sank further, as Instagram Stories reached 150 million daily users, just shy of Snapchat’s total number. Snapchat only pulled in an average daily user count of 158 million with a 3.2% growth rate in Q4. \nThat means Snapchat was growing at just 1/5th of the speed it was two quarters earlier. Its growth rate actually slowed beneath that of Facebook, which grew daily users 4.2% in Q4 to reach 1.23 billion . By December Snap had 161 million users, but that’s not enough to buck this trend. If you calculated the growth between the Q3 average and December 2016, it would still only by 5.2%. \nSnapchat admitted in its IPO filing’s risk factors that “We face significant competition in almost every aspect of our business both domestically and internationally” listing many companies including Facebook and Instagram. Then it noted “For example, Instagram, a subsidiary of Facebook, recently introduced a “stories” feature that largely mimics our Stories feature and may be directly competitive.” \nThis decline in user growth rate may force Snapchat to define itself not by scale, but by the deep engagement it shows. The most impressive stats in today’s IPO filing centered around just how often each of its users open the app. The average daily user opens Snapchat 18 times a day and uses it for 25 to 30 minutes, with 60% of them creating Snaps and/or using its chat feature daily. \nThat engagement combined with vivid full-screen ads may be enough for it to build a healthy business. But you can expect the growth rate to become a fixation for Wall Street. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:26:04.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
