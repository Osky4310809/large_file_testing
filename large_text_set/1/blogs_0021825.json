Sadly, it did the exact opposite! \nRelated: Here Are Donald Trump's First Three Executive Orders! \nAccording to sources, the businessman's \"uncomfortable\" visit \"made relations with the intelligence community worse.\" YIKES! \nTo make matters worse, Donald apparently filled the first three rows with supporters in order to make it seem like people actually like him. An insider says around 40 people were invited by Trump, VP Mike Pence , and Representative Mike Pompeo . While CIA officials were sitting in the front, we're told they were NOT cheering for the newly elected President; in fact, many staffers were offended by his tone of voice. \nThis report contradicts what White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Monday where he denied there were \"Trump or White House folks\" in the first few rows. He said: \n\"There were no Trump or White House folks sitting down. They were all CIA… So, not in rows one-through-anything, from what I'm told.\" \nConsidering Spicer lied about Trump's inauguration attendees, we're not surprised he's spewing more garbage. Alternative facts, much??", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T06:08:38.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
