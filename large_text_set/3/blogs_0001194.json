The others are: Champagne West, Devils Bride, Triolo D'Alene, Vieux Morvan, Gallant Oscar, Tour Des Champs, Dromnea and Otago Trail. The weighting game Unlike the Cheltenham Gold Cup, where horses race off level weights, the Grand National is a handicap. Horses are ranked according to their previous form, with the best given top weight. The handicapper's ultimate (although in practice unfeasible) aim is for the horses to pass the winning post in a dead heat. The closest finish came in 2012 when Neptune Collonges denied Sunnyhillboy by the shortest possible distance - a nose. \nTrainer Gordon Elliott had indicated Outlander would not run as soon as he was allocated top weight of 11st 10lb, and Ryanair boss O'Leary has lived up to his vow to withdraw several of his leading hopes. \nRoad To Riches and Rogue Angel are among his horses still in the marathon contest, for which the weights are now headed by Carlingford Lough, with last year's runner-up The Last Samuri next on the list.
