Whilst this method is great at providing an instant dose of volume, it can lead to lot of damage if it’s done badly. \nThe back-and-forth motion used in this technique often cause breakage and split ends. Plus, it leads to knots and tangles. However, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t tease your hair! In order to protect your precious locks, all you have to do is follow these easy steps: Step One: Start With Dry Hair \nNever ever tease wet hair unless you really want to destroy it! Make sure your mane is 100% dry before beginning. Conair 1875-Watt Pro Styler | Source: Conair Step Two: Detangle \nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive, use a wide tooth comb to ease out any knots. Smooth hair is always the best canvas. Vega Large De-Tangling Comb | Source: Vega Step Three: Add Texture \nAdd a little grip to your locks with the help of a dry texturising spray.

Rather than going back-and-forth, brush your hair in a downward motion only. Work in small sections.

When you are done for the day, work in a bit of leave-in conditioner to help break up the knots. Then, wash and comb it out. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T14:31:59.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
