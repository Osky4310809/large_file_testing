The course should really set up well for my game and I’m really looking forward to teeing it up there in June against some of the Tour’s best players.” \nThe Travelers will be part of a busy stretch for McIlroy. He will play five times in a six-week stretch, including starts at the Irish Open and Scottish Open leading into The Open . \nRussell Knox is the defending champion at TPC River Highlands .
