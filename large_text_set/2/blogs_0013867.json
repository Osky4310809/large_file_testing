The announcement was made today by John Entz, President of Production and Executive Producer, FOX Sports. \nRecently retired, Swisher, a fan-favorite with an infectious personality throughout his 12-year playing career, makes his 2017 debut on FS1’s MLB Whiparound this April and appears regularly as a studio analyst during FOX Sports’ pregame coverage on Saturdays during the regular season. Swisher made his first ever appearance as a studio analyst during FOX’s World Series coverage in 2014. \n“Swish was impressive as an analyst for us during the 2014 World Series and we knew we wanted to engage with him once he made the decision to retire,” said Entz. “His positivity and clear love for the game comes through on screen and we love that about him. We also just found out that he likes to go shark diving which is always a plus.” \n“I’m super excited for this new chapter and can’t wait to get out to the FS1 studios in a few short weeks,” said Nick Swisher. Swisher announced his retirement today via a post to the Players Tribune and on his twitter account @NickSwisher. \nDrafted 16th overall in 2002, Swisher’s successful Major League career spanned across five different franchises: Oakland Athletics (2004-2007), Chicago White Sox (2008), New York Yankees (2009-2012), Cleveland Indians (2013-2015) and Atlanta Braves (2015). Swisher was selected to the American League All-Star team in 2010 as a member of the New York Yankees, where he played an integral part in earning the team’s record 27th World Series title in 2009. Swisher finishes his career with a .249 batting average, 803 RBIs and 245 homeruns. \n(FOX Sports press release)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:32:59.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
