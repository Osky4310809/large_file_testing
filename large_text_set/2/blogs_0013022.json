The kids were mad at me last year because I put co-champs on the T-shirts. We were co-champs,” Whitehall coach Nate Aardema said. “If we want to get it outright, then we have to come to work tomorrow and start prepping for Hart and see where we are.” \nAardema won’t tinker with Vikings outside shooting after they made 13 3-pointers compared to three by Montague and that turned out to be a huge difference in the game. \nSchumm hit six 3-pointers en route to a game-high 27 points. Young, who finished with 22 points, and Casey Huizenga each had three 3s and 6-6 junior center Brandon Rake added the other. All but one of the 3-pointers came in the final three quarters. \n“I saw the first one go in, after that the crowd kind of quieted down a little bit and I was into it,” Schumm said. “It’s crazy to watch.” \nSo has been the league race this season. Neither Whitehall nor Montague were considered to be the favorites this season, but they are alone at the top. \n“We thought so, I don’t think anybody else did. That’s why it’s so important to keep yourself within the locker room, keep your ears within the locker room and believe in yourself,” Schumm said. “I don’t think one newspaper had us as the conference champs and here we are, co-champions, at least and we’re hoping to seal the deal Friday and if not, we’ve got one more after that.” \nMontague raced out to a 12-2 lead and fought all the way behind the inside play of senior Josh Weesies, who finished with 26 points, but came up short. Whitehall handed Montague its other league loss 55-52 in January. \n“I feel bad for our seniors. (Merritt) Hamann is playing basically with strep throat right now,” Montague coach Dave Osborne said. “You can see he wasn’t himself. When you hit 13 3s, it’s going to be, I would dare say they haven’t hit 13 in the last three games, maybe. Maybe they are better shooting than I thought.” \nWith Hamann limited to eight points, Weesies and Abram Erickson picked up the slack for the Wildcats, who slip to 10-2 in the league and 12-3 overall. Weesies bulled his way to the basket and used a nice drop-step to score at will and Erickson added 17 for Montague. \nMontague led most of the first half until Schumm went off to score 15 consecutive points for Whitehall, turning a 25-22 deficit into a 39-31 halftime lead. \nIn the second half, Whitehall went ahead 65-52 early in the fourth quarter when Osborne picked up the first technical of his career questioning what he thought were repeated missed calls. Montague rallied to cut it to 67-66 with two minutes to play and had Whitehall on the ropes. \nBut the Vikings went four corners and Young scored on a drive and hit two free throws with 5.3 seconds left to seal it for Whitehall. \n“I told Drew yesterday he was going to have a good night,” Aardema said. “He’s so capable and it’s just a matter of him being aggressive.” \nAardema coached the game with a cast on his right wrist after getting hurt in a 30-and-over pickup game two weeks ago, but it didn’t seem to bother him. \nHe joked his playing career might be over, but not his coaching. \n“I love it. I get the greatest kids. It’s such a blast,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T15:36:24.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
