Wanna know what's not so great? If you're an Android user and you don't have enough internal storage left to store videos.\nA new update to the Android app fixes that. Users with Android mobile devices that support microSD cards can now download videos to the external storage.\nSEE ALSO: Everything you need to know about Netflix downloads\nTo change the download location from the internal storage to a microSD card, simply tap the menu button > App Settings > Download Location > then change it from \"Internal Storage\" to \"SD Card.\"\nThere should be no limit to the amount of videos you can download, so long as you have enough storage to do so.\nOf course, there's a caveat. Netflix says the feature is \"not available on all devices.\" Mashable tried the feature on a Samsung Galaxy S7, LG G5, and Moto X (2015) and had no problems.\nAs for pirates thinking they can just move the downloaded files from the memory card to a computer and watch them forever? Think again; downloaded videos have DRM and are encoded in a \".nfv\" file, which isn't playable on any other media players. Nice try!\nBONUS: The top 9 shows to watch in 2017", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/2iNpUfz6.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/2iNpUfz6.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-25T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T02:27:45.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
