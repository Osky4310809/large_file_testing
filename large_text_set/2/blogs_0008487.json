Britain’s most racist election: the story of Smethwick, 50 years on Read more \nJohn Bickley, who is also the party’s treasurer, apologised in a statement to the Huffington Post , for offence caused by the similarities to a slogan used half a century ago in the infamous West Midlands campaign. \n“Yesterday I retweeted a cartoon about the potential consequences of Labour’s support for uncontrolled immigration without realising it relied on a rhyme that had been used in an election in 1964 in a racially abusive context,” he said, after widespread criticism from Labour MPs and others on social media. The retweet has since been deleted. Owen Bennett (@owenjbennett) February 12, 2017 \nThe cartoon is an original image by Peter Brookes of the Times, entitled “Entryism” from August 2015, at the height of Europe’s refugee crisis. \nThe original shows people clambering into a lorry with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in the driver’s seat, with one sitting on the top of the vehicle waving a communist flag. \nThe image is a clear play on the accusations that hard-left activists were infiltrating the Labour party to vote for Corbyn, who had just won the leadership contest, as well as the party’s attitude to refugees and migrants. \nHowever, in the version retweeted by Bickley, the title has been cropped out, as has the communist flag. \nThe slogan, “if you want a jihadi for a neighbour, vote Labour” has been added manually and is not part of the original cartoon. David Jones, the Twitter account retweeted by Bickley, regularly shares anti-Muslim and far right memes. \nAfter several Twitter users including ITV’s Robert Peston raised the cartoon with the party leader Paul Nuttall , Ukip donor and Leave.EU founder Arron Banks said he did not object to the cartoon’s sentiment, tweeting: “Seems eminently accurate to me.” \nTottenham MP David Lammy said the retweet showed the party’s true colours, drawing the comparison the 1964 Smethwick byelection. David Lammy (@DavidLammy) February 13, 2017 \nThe 1964 Smethwick byelection became notorious when the seat was won by Conservative candidate Peter Griffiths, against the national trend, amid allegations of racist campaigning by the far right. \nThe Conservative party insisted the racist slogan was not official party literature, though Griffiths refused to condemn them, saying they were “a manifestation of popular feeling”. \nBickley, who has stood in several byelections for the party, said in his statement he wanted to “apologise for any offence caused” because of the racist origins of the slogan, but he did not explicitly apologise for its anti-Muslim sentiment. \nThe tweet is not the first time Bickley has been criticised for his campaigning tactics. In 2015 as a candidate in the Heywood and Middleton byelection, he accused Labour of a “betrayal of the young white working-class girls of Rotherham and Rochdale, rather than upset immigrant communities” in reference to the grooming scandals in the town. \nBickley also contested the Oldham West and Royton byelection after the death of veteran Labour MP Michael Meacher. A key target for the party, Bickley only managed to secure an incremental increase in the vote. \nNuttall, who is standing in the Stoke Central byelection, backed his immigration spokesman. He said: “He’s got my support, absolutely, he’s apologised for it. It wasn’t clever and John’s apologised and he’s taken it down.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T17:22:36.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
