Baton Rouge police spokesman Sgt. L'Jean McKneely told the Advocate that Bennett grabbed the officer's stun flashlight, radio and baton, using it to repeatedly bash the officer in the head. He allegedly tried to grab the officer’s gun as well. \nThat was when Williams-Tillman came to the rescue. \n“ I could see in his eyes he needed help, ” Williams-Tillman told the Advocate. “ You don't have time to think about it… I did what God needed me to do. ” \nShe managed to hold Bennett off until more officers arrived at the scene.
