Martinez rounded Fire keeper Jorge Bava and sent his shot into the empty net. \nLiga MX resumes with potential hangovers \nMartinez, who is on loan from Serie A side Torino, just barely stayed on, but it counted all the same. \nThen in the 82nd minute with Atlanta up 3-0, Martinez again received a throughball, this time from Yamil Asad, and got past Bava once more. Despite having a very narrow angle to shoot at, the striker snuck it inside the far post for the brace. You gotta be kidding with that finish, @JosefMartinez17 . #ATLvCHI https://t.co/fU66QF41zr — Major League Soccer (@MLS) March 18, 2017 \nIf you’re not convinced by how little angle Martinez had, check this shot out: — Major League Soccer (@MLS) March 18, 2017 \nThat brings Martinez’s goal total up to five on the season in just three games, after his hat trick against fellow expansion side Minnesota United last week.
