Delaware Prison Riot & Hostage Situation: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published Updated 4:30 pm EDT, February 2, 2017 7 Comments By Tom Cleary 42.1k Share Tweet Follow \nA corrections officer was killed when inmates complaining about prison conditions and President Donald Trump took control of a building and held four guards hostage. \nThe hostage situation at the maximum security James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna lasted nearly 20 hours, the Wilmington News-Journal reports . \nOne guard was found dead inside the prison when authorities entered the building about 5:30 a.m. Thursday. A female corrections officer was rescued. Two other guards, one with non-life-threatening injuries, were released on Wednesday. \nSergeant Steven Floyd , a 16-year veteran of the Department of Corrections, has been identified as the officer killed. \nThe situation, which prisoners called a “rebellion,” began Wednesday about 10:30 a.m. It is not known how many prisoners took part in the uprising and hostage-taking. Other prisoners were also being held hostage along with the guards, according to phone calls made from inside the facility to the News-Journal. \nDelaware State Police and the FBI were assisting the state Department of Corrections, which oversees the prison. \nAll other prisons in Delaware were locked down as a precaution, per state policy. \nHere’s what we know so far: 1. The Guards Were Taken Hostage in a Building Holding More Than 100 Inmates \n— Suchat Pederson (@SuchatPederson) February 1, 2017 \nSergeant Richard Bratz said a correction officer called for immediate assistance in “C” Building, which holds more than 100 inmates, about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday. \nThe facility was placed on lock down and four guards were taken hostage. About 2:30 p.m., one of the guards, who was injured, was released and taken to the hospital. He is expected to survive. \nA second guard released later Wednesday. Police initially said five guards had been held, but then reduced that number to four. \nOfficers breached the building about 5 a.m. Thursday, and rescued a third guard. The fourth guard was found and pronounced dead. \n“I’m praying hard for the fallen officer’s family,” Governor John Carney said in a statement. “This serves as a tragic reminder that members of law enforcement risk their lives every day on behalf of the people of Delaware. We will stand by the fallen officer’s family and fellow law enforcement officers during what is an extremely difficult time.” \n“This was a long and agonizing situation,” he continued. “I want to thank all those involved in responding, including officers at the Department of Correction and the Delaware State Police, as well as our federal partners. Our priority now will be to determine what happened and how this happened. We will hold accountable anyone who was responsible. And we will make whatever changes are necessary to ensure nothing like it ever happens again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T05:40:57.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
