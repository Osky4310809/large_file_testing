And apparently it's so popular that it's getting its own show, beyond the confines of his talk program.\nAccording to the president of TBS, \"video game companies are sending [them] their new product...because it's been such a huge success.\" Reilly also shuts down the rumor that Conan's core show is moving to a once a week format, noting that this is \"more activity for him...not less.\"\nI hope that \"activity\" involves more trips to the Taco Bell headquarters.\nConan O'Brien to Remain Nightly, for Now, TBS Boss Kevin Reilly Says [Hollywood Reporter]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T19:43:06.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
