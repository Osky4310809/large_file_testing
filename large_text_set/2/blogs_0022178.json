From wins for fan-fueled films like Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts to political messages and that ending , the 89th Annual Academy Awards were full of emotionally exhausting surprises — and became one unforgettable night.\nBest Moonlight swings an upset\nIn the most insane Oscar plot twist ever, the La La Land team was mid-acceptance speech when they stopped to declare that Moonlight actually won best picture.\nThat time when La La Land realized they lost to Moonlight. #ICYMI pic.twitter.com/5b425PSJH3\n— Mashable (@mashable) February 27, 2017\n\"This is not a joke,\" repeated producer Jordan Horowitz (probably because Jimmy Kimmel was in the vicinity) before Warren Beatty returned to show the winning envelope to the camera.\nMatt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel fuel their feud\nChildren have been born and grown sentient since Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel began trolling each other with Sarah Silverman in 2008 . Since then, the friendly rivalry (mostly friendly) became a recurring bit on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and finally transcended the Oscar stage on Sunday night.\nJimmy Kimmel's years-long feud with Matt Damon doesn't stop just because it's the #Oscars pic.twitter.com/E1dGkiDbaV\n— Mashable (@mashable) February 27, 2017\nThe Hidden Figures cast welcomes Katherine Johnson\nThe woman whose real-life story is at the center of Hidden Figures took the Oscar stage next to the powerhouse trio of Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe. Johnson's story may have been hidden for decades, but now it's finally seeing light.\nThe stars of 'Hidden Figures' welcome the real-life Katherine Johnson to the #Oscars pic.twitter.com/rGHKuCpg8m\n— Mashable (@mashable) February 27, 2017\nAuli'i Cravalho absolutely crushes \"How Far I'll Go\"\nThe 16-year-old Moana star and singer performed the film's Best Original Song contender with a rap intro from composer Lin-Manuel Miranda. Not only was her performance poised and poignant, but it was accompanied by breathtaking choreography from La La Land choreographer Mandy Moore.\nLoved this performance!! #Moana #Oscars pic.twitter.com/PZQcYKq0te\n— Natasha Del Riego (@natashaaa__) February 27, 2017\nAsghar Farhadi's winning letter for The Salesman\nThe Iranian filmmaker skipped the Oscars to send a message to the American government about Donald Trump's immigration ban. In a letter from Farhadi read on stage by Anousheh Ansari, he called the ban \"inhumane\" and amplified a message of empathy and inclusion.\nDenzel officiates a wedding\nThe bus of unsuspecting gatecrashers may have been one of the worst Oscar bits ever, but Denzel Washington saved it because that's what he does. When passenger Vicky called him out as her favorite actor, Washington leapt from his seat to pronounce her and fiancee Gary husband and wife.\nBest use of selfie stick at the #Oscars pic.twitter.com/TOVqcLpEfH\n— Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) February 27, 2017\nSunny Pawar, the Lion king\nThe Lion star who stole Hollywood's hearts this season indulged in a bit with Jimmy Kimmel that ended in the Oscar host lifting Pawar up a lá Simba to the intro from \"Circle of Life.\"\nLemonheads and Mike and Ikes #Oscars pic.twitter.com/Gr4iRmytZS\n— Mashable GIF (@mashablegif) February 27, 2017\nWorst Jimmy Kimmel being lazy\nKimmel's opening monologue included a poor Moonlight sex joke and a very old joke that sounded better from Tina Fey and Amy Poehler . He parachuted in candy the way that Ellen delivered pizza , he brought in a bus full of tourists who couldn't care less, and ABC shamelessly highlighted his show with a section of \" Mean Tweets .\" Sorry, Jimmy, but we deserve better.\nNOT YOUR JOKE, JIMMY pic.twitter.com/Vq6e0T15VU\n— Kristin Chirico (@lolacoaster) February 27, 2017\nAll the Mel Gibson jokes\nHey Hollywood, we know: Mel Gibson is problematic. You can't un-nominate him by awkwardly acknowledging how weird it is at every available opportunity. If you feel weird about honoring the work of a known anti-Semite, don't honor the work of a known anti-Semite. Or an alleged sexual abuser , at that.\nthis whole show is like, \"mel gibson is racist and we all know it and we'll laugh about it but invite him anyway\" #Oscars\n— Caroline (@carolinefallonn) February 27, 2017\nThe bus full of randos\nAre a group of people on a bus tour during the Oscars really going to care about the Oscars? The gobsmacked guests stumbled through interviews with Kimmel, shell-shocked selfies and the prophetic whispers of Ryan Gosling , and we could've done without any of it.\nBONUS: The 10 most painful Oscar snubs of all time", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mashablegif/status/836058367978311682", "https://t.co/E1dGkiDbaV", "https://t.co/PZQcYKq0te", "https://t.co/5b425PSJH3", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ICYMI?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/836053163975262208", "https://t.co/rGHKuCpg8m", "https://t.co/Vq6e0T15VU", "https://twitter.com/natashaaa__/status/836040863155355648", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Moana?src=hash", "https://t.co/Gr4iRmytZS", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/OFvQaUIh.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/mashable/status/836090257678413825", "https://t.co/TOVqcLpEfH", "https://twitter.com/mashable/status/836073440104824832", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/OFvQaUIh.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Oscars?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/carolinefallonn/status/836044616444960768", "http://oscar.go.com/news/music-moments/watch-moana-performance-at-the-2017-oscars", "https://twitter.com/mashable/status/836037423637360640", "https://twitter.com/lolacoaster/status/836029129514336256", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSfoF6MhgLA"], "published": "2017-02-27T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:31:06.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
