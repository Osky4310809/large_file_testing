We are 30kph down on the straight.\" \nSpeaking to Sky Sports News HQ, Alonso added: \"I'm driving at my best. I feel I am the best driver out there, I just need an engine that can run as quick as the others on the straight. \nAlonso also described the fault with the MCL32's fuel tank on the first day of winter testing as an \"amateur problem\". \nThe two-time world champion, who quit Ferrari to join McLaren ahead of their reunion with Honda two years ago, was even more outspoken with the Spanish media, reputedly telling reporters: \"The team are all ready to win except Honda.\" \nWith just 334 laps completed, most of which have been run at reduced power to nurse the Honda engine and with a longest stint of just 11, Alonso estimated McLaren were still at \"day two\" level of their programme. \n\"We have to improveâ€¦definitely there [must be] a big reaction from the team which l expect immediately,\" said Alonso. \nWhile denying McLaren's problems were on a par with the nadir of 2015, when the McLaren-Honda reunion immediately hit seismic problems, the Spaniard admitted: \"The frustration is probably more this year because after the change in regulations you have higher hopes that you can close the gap over winter testing.\" \nAlonso vows to bow out of F1 as a winner But despite Alonso's scathing criticism of Honda, the 35-year-old has insisted he still believes he can win with McLaren and has no intention of walking away from F1. \n\"I am confident that this year we will be competitive. I don't know at which point of the year but we will be competitive and l want to win races. The team will be fully ready for Australia and to compete at a good level,\" he said. \"The only question is how much power we will have.\" \nAlonso has spoken previously of being prepared to leave Formula 1 if he didn't enjoy the sport's new brand of cars but insisted on Tuesday that he was enjoying driving the MCL32 despite its engine woes and had given no thought of quitting. \n\"This brings me more motivation to continue and to win,\" he told reporters. \"I will not stop racing without a good result and one l deserve. \n\"If one day in the car l see people are doing fantastic lines, they are braking later than me, they do better starts than me, on that day l will stop and say 'it's time'. But what l am seeing now is completely the opposite. More than ever, this year, this winter, what l see on the track from myself is the best level. Now it's the time to attack.\" \nThe Sky Sports F1 Digital team will be providing live commentary from dawn until dusk for all days of winter testing while Sky Sports News HQ will also deliver live updates from trackside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T20:29:33.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
