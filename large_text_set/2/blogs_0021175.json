The information is based on a Samsung spec sheet. \nThe S8+, as it is dubbed on the spec sheet, boasts a touchscreen measuring just over 6 inches, as well as a 12-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel front camera. It will also include an iris scanner, introduced with the discontinued Galaxy Note 7 line. Samsung Galaxy S8+ spec sheet.

The electronics giant will host a press conference on February 26 during Mobile World Congress, where it has traditionally showcased its latest smartphones. However, Samsung will not show the S8 there, instead reportedly planning a reveal in the spring . \nThe launch of the Galaxy S8 is critical to Samsung, as they attempt to recover from the disastrous launch of the Galaxy Note 7. The smartphone had to be pulled from shelves after reports the device would overheat and either catch fire or explode. \nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .
