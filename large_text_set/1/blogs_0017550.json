The train was traveling between Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh state to Bhuvaneshawar in Orissa. \n\"Thirty-six people have been killed so far and 19 bodies have been identified,\" said JP Mishra, a spokesman for East Coast Railway, adding, however, that the toll could rise further as many people were still trapped. Poor safety record \nIndia's railway system is the world's third largest, but is severely hampered by a lack of modern signaling and communication systems as well as poor maintenance of tracks and equipment. Manual signaling is still used at several places, raising the risk of human error. \nIn November , 146 people were killed when a packed passenger train derailed near the town of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh in the deadliest rail accident in the country in at least five years.

The worst occurred in 1981, when a train fell into the Baghmati River in northern India, killing nearly 800 people. \nNarendra Modi, India's p rime minister, pledged last year to invest $137bn over the next five years to modernise the railway network, which is used by about 23 million passengers a day. \nIn a message on Twitter on Sunday, Modi expressed his condolences for those killed in the latest accident and said the railway ministry was monitoring the situation closely.
