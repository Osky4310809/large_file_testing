Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 \n\nSo, we decided to take a look at the latest such poll from CNN and \"shockingly\" found that Trump kind of has a point . For some reason, CNN/ORC simply can't seem to conduct a poll where the distribution of respondents mirrors the actual distribution of registered voters in the U.S. As you can see below, in the latest \"oversample\" farce, CNN decided that filling it's poll with Democrats was becoming way too obvious and, as such, just decided that 45% of registered voters are suddenly independent. From the polling methodology: \nA total of 1,002 adults were interviewed by telephone nationwide by live interviewers calling both landline and cell phones. Among the entire sample, 29% described themselves as Democrats, 25% described themselves as Republicans , and 45% described themselves as independents or members of another party. \nOf course, as we've pointed out multiple times, actual voter registration numbers are no where near CNN/ORC's latest distribution. \n\nBut, at least CNN was able to engineer its desired result with 53% of their respondents saying they oppose Trump's travel ban. \n\nMeanwhile, 55% of the respondents in CNN's \"rigged poll\" seem to view Trump's immigration executive order as a \"Muslim ban.\" \n\nOf course, as we've noted before, only 12.5% of the world's Muslims live in the seven countries on Trump's immigration ban list...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:28:36.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
