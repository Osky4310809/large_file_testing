(Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com) \nIn the parlance of politics, Fox Sports Midwest has been trumped. \nFor the first time in 108 years, the Chicago Cubs are the reigning World Series champions. And with them opening the season against the fierce rival Cards, it was a natural for ESPN to grab the game to show nationally as the opener to its “Sunday Night Baseball” package. It’s a stand-alone game on opening night of the season — there are a couple afternoon games that day, but nobody else is scheduled to play that evening. \nESPN has exclusive rights. So regular Cards local telecaster FSM, which is set to show 147 of their games this season, is out. But only in part. \nUnlike in the political world, in which talk often is big and results small, FSM has pulled a nifty move and is set to carry the home opener pregame festivities — always a big deal in St. Louis. \n“Opening day is one of the marquee events on the St. Louis sports calendar,” Fox Sports Midwest general manager Jack Donovan said in a statement. “When ESPN picked up the opener, we began working with the Cardinals to ensure that fans throughout the region will be able to watch the ceremony live.” \nESPN has had two other Cards openers on Sunday night in recent years, but both were on the road so the home-opener festivities were not affected. \nThis will be the first time FSM will televise the ceremonies without showing the Cards’ game that follows, and it will be the first time such an arrangement has been done in St. Louis since 2007. \nKSDK (Channel 5) had a dreadful presentation then, when it carried the events before ESPN showed the game. In addition to technical problems, Channel 5 announcers kept yakking while players were being introduced and the faces of some of the athletes were obliterated by a box showing an inane fan interview. \nFor a time FSM had its share of snafus covering the home-opener hubbub, mainly by turning the focus away from the main events taking place on the field. But thankfully those problems have been a thing of the past in recent years. \nThis is one event in which those in the audience just want the basics — to see and hear what is happening on the field. \nThis year’s schedule includes the proven fan favorites — a parade around the field by the Budweiser Clydesdales, a salute to Cardinals Hall of Famers and introductions of members of this year’s Redbirds team. \nDan McLaughlin and Rick Horton are to anchor that coverage from FSM’s studio in Ballpark Village, starting at 6:30 p.m., with Jim Hayes reporting from Busch Stadium. \nThat production also is to be steamed on Foxsportsgo, which is available to those who subscribe to FSM. BASKETBALL BIZ \nIt’s the mantra of the week — one blue blood and a bunch of new blood in the NCAA Tournament’s national semifinals. \nNorth Carolina is in the Final Four for the 20th time, but two other participants (Gonzaga, South Carolina) never have been it and the other team (Oregon) hasn’t made it since 1939. \nThat’s hardly an ideal lineup, at least historically, for CBS — which will be televising the national semifinals on Saturday and title contest on Monday night. \nOfficials of that network have said in the past that it is better for ratings if there are well-established schools involved. But CBS Sports chairman Sean McManus points to strong ratings for the tourney to date as he is optimistic for a big weekend. \n“I think we’ve got enormous tail winds headed into the championship weekend,” he said on a conference call this week. \nLouisville leads the way in ratings for the tourney to date among the 56 major markets in which Nielsen tabulates viewership electronically, with 20.5 percent of homes with a TV there turning in on average. Kansas City is next, at 15.8. St. Louis is No. 26, with a 6.7 rating. \nCBS (KMOV, Channel 4 locally) has more than three hours of pregame programming scheduled for Saturday, starting at 2 p.m. \nGreg Gumbel, Steve Smith, Seth Davis and Jay Wright are to participate from a set outside University of Phoenix Stadium, with Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley, Clark Kellogg and Kenny Smith contributing from a courtside set. \n“We’re really poised to have some great studio programming,” McManus said. “I think the momentum that all of us have instinctively felt during the first two weekends of the tournament is going to carry to the Final Four weekend.” \nHow much that translates into viewership levels remains to be seen. \n“The ratings are primarily going to be determined by the closeness of the games and the excitement surrounding the games,” he said. “I’m happy that we have broad national distribution (of teams), but I’ll be even happier if the games are close.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:35:01.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
