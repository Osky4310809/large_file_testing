The video of a “release candidate version” of the Model 3 is over in six seconds. It could be enough to satiate fans and shareholders --at least temporarily--as pre-production of the Model 3 ramps up.\nA “release candidate” is a critical step on the road to a production-ready vehicle. This typically indicates an automaker is building the cars on production equipment to test the manufacturing process and the new vehicle.\nFirst drive of a release candidate version of Model 3 pic.twitter.com/zcs6j1YRa4 \n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017 \n\nTesla introduced a prototype version of Model 3 in a splashy event nearly a year ago. Since then, activity at the company’s Fremont, Calif., factory and the company’s headquarters has escalated to a frenetic pace as it prepares for its most important vehicle to date.\nThe $35,000 electric vehicle marks the company’s official transition from niche luxury automaker to the mainstream.\nTesla is expected to begin limited vehicle production of the Model 3 in July. It plans to ramp up production to more than 5,000 vehicles per week in the fourth quarter and to 10,000 vehicles per week at some point in 2018, according to a shareholder letter released in February.\nEarlier this month, Tesla raised about $1.2 billion --about $350 million in common shares and $850 million in convertible debt--a much needed cash injection for the company as it ramps up pre-production of the Model 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:10:22.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
