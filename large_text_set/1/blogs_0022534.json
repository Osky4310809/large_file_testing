Clayton claims that he was a child visiting a park the very first time he was abducted, and that he feels the aliens might be studying him throughout his life. \n“I remember just floating up higher,” Donna Lee recounted about her experience, “And, all that was around were stars and blackness. And then, I blacked out.” \nThe couple have had their memories of this event awakened by a local psychologist, who ironically, doesn’t actually believe in aliens herself. \nThey have both drawn sketches of the aliens, and appeared on multiple media outlets to talk about their story, including this one on the O’Reilly Factor : \nO’REILLY: All right. And you were abducted multiple amounts of times? \nD. LEE: Yes, yes. \nO’REILLY: Did you ever talk to the abductees? I mean, did they tell you where they were from or anything? \nD. LEE: No, that I don’t have any remembering of at all, having the conversation, no. \nO’REILLY: So they just swept you away somewhere? Where’d they put you? \nD. LEE: Different places, different times. I’ve had memories of being on what I consider the ship, because I know it was someplace other than any place I’d ever visited before. \nO’REILLY: So you were in some kind of — you were in some kind of vehicle? \nD. LEE: Yes. It was a vehicle, a room. It was very cold, metal. A lot of metal. A lot of metal. \nO’REILLY: Did you see — did you see the aliens? \nD. LEE: Yes. \nO’REILLY: What do they look like? \nD. LEE: What I saw on that particular visit, they were tall, slender, blond. Looked human, but not human, not quite human. \nO’REILLY: All right. \nD. LEE: They didn’t really use their voices to talk. \nThe couple say they remain worried about being abducted against almost daily, but that they want to “live their lives” regardless. 2. The Gundiah Mackay Alien Abduction \nIn a chilling story that three different people were involved in, a 22-year-old named Amy was abducted right out the window of her lounge room by some sort of flying craft. \nAmy’s husband Keith had already gone to bed, while her friend Petra stayed up to read in another room. Petra was abruptly disrupted by a blinding light coming from the lounge room, and the sound of shattering glass. \nThe rectangular beam of light was shining into the room, and according to Petra, she saw Amy being pulled out of the window by the light, still apparently asleep. \nKeith then woke up, and both he and Petra searched the house and surrounding area for Amy, who was nowhere to be seen. Keith eventually called the police. \nAmy eventually turned up miles away, with strange marks on her inner thigh, and bizarrely extensive body hair growth. 3. Russian millionaire politician taken by Aliens? \nKirsan Ilyumzhinov, the former President of the only Buddhist political state, avidly claims that he was once kidnapped by creatures not of this world. \nHe says they abducted him off his apartment balcony, and took him to their spaceship: \nYeah! yeah, yeah, yeah I was taken from my apartment in Moscow to this spaceship! And we went to some star. After that I asked “Please bring me back” because the next day I should be back in Kalmykia! They said oh no problem Kirsan, you have time. \nWhen pressed for details of the aliens themselves, Ilyumzhinov says: \nThey are people like us. They have the same mind, the same vision. I talked with them. I understand that we are not alone in the whole world. We are not unique. \nThe ship was absolutely enormous. One of its chambers was the size of a large football pitch. We landed on one of the planets and picked up some piece of equipment. They told me everything in detail. \nAllegedly, while Ilyumzhinov was abducted, his staff came looking for him and was unable to locate him until he inexplicably appeared in his suite hours later. 4. The Robert Taylor Incident \nRobert Taylor was a forestry worker in Livingston, Scotland. He was heading to work in the woods in 1979 when he turned a corner, and saw a UFO parked in a field. \nAll at once, two small spheres came from the object. They made a sound as their spikes moved over the earth. They came to a stop beside him, grabbing his trousers, and began to drag him back to the UFO. The spiked objects were very similar to the UFO, only smaller. Taylor could smell a strong, sickening odor. He lost consciousness. \nWhen he regained consciousness, the spheres were gone, but his red setter was still there. The dog was panicky, running around and barking. Taylor tried to calm him down, but found that his voice was gone. He was very weak, and when he tried to stand, he couldn’t. He crawled for a time until he was able to stand again. \nHe finally made it back to his pick-up truck and tried to radio his work headquarters via his two-way, but still could not speak. \nAttempting to drive his truck back home, he got stuck in the mud, so he started a long walk of about a mile back to his house. He arrived at 11:45 AM. ( Source ) \nHis wife phoned the police once he got home, remarking that he “looked terrible.” The police began an investigation, having no true explanation for the bizarre tracks left at the scene of the UFO. No aircraft — civilian or military — was scheduled to be in the area according to comprehensive flight logs. 5. Forestry worker goes MIA for five days — where was he?? \nTravis Walton was one of seven men working in a forestry team in Snowflake, Arizona. When heading home from work one night, the team spied a blindingly bright light. Thinking it was a crashed plane, they drove over to the craft. What they saw, however, did not look like any plane: Youtube / UFOCaseReview \nWalton jumped out of the truck to get closer to the craft. Suddenly, a bright light shot from the UFO and sent Walton floating into the UFO. The remaining six crew members, panicked, and drove away from the scene to get help. \nAbout 7:30 p.m., one of the crew members called the police. Deputy Sheriff Chuck Ellison answered the telephone; The crew member initially reported only that one of a logging crew was missing. Ellison then met the crew at a shopping center. They related the tale to him — all the men distraught, two of them in tears — and though he was somewhat skeptical of the fantastic account, Ellison would later reflect “that if they were acting, they were awfully good at it.” ( Source ) \nAfter an initial scan of the area showed no evidence of an “UFO” the police began to suspect the men were using the story to coverup the fact that they simply murdered Walton. However, over the next few days, all six loggers were subjected to intense interrogations and polygraphs, and their story seemed to hold up. \nThat’s when Walton suddenly reappeared. Thinking he had only been gone for a few hours, Walton retold parts of the story he could. \nHe said he was interrogated by three creatures with bald heads and huge eyes. He apparently encountered many different creatures on the craft, who performed experiments on him. \nMany people were skeptical of the story, but Walton and all the other loggers maintain their stories. 6. The Manhattan Abduction \nLinda Napolitano (originally aliased as Linda Cortile) triggered one of the most well-documented UFO abduction cases when she claimed to have been kidnapped out the window of her Manhattan apartment building by a flying saucer. \nLinda describes her time with the aliens: \n“I’m standing up on nothing. And they take me out all the way up, way above the building. Ooh, I hope I don’t fall. The UFO opens up almost like a clam and then I’m inside. I see benches similar to regular benches. And they’re bringing me down a hallway. \nDoors open like sliding doors. Inside are all these lights and buttons and a big long table. I don’t want to get up on that table. They get me on the table anyway. They start saying things to me and I’m yelling. I can still yell. One of them says something that sounds like {Nobbyegg}. I think they were trying to tell me to be quiet because he put his hand over my mouth.” \nHer abduction story has been corroborated by two United Nations bodyguards, who claim to have seen exactly the scene that Linda describes. \n“There was an oval-shaped object hovering over the top of the apartment building two or three blocks up from where we sat. \nWe didn’t know where it came from. It happened too fast. Its lights turned from a bright reddish orange to a whitish blue coming out of the bottom. Green lights rotated round the edge of the saucer. A little girl or woman wearing a white gown sailed out of the window in a fetal position – and then stood in mid-air in this beam of light. I could see three of the ugliest creatures I ever saw. I don’t know what they were. They weren’t human. \nTheir heads were out of proportion, very large heads with no hair. Those buggers were escorting her into the craft. My partner screamed, ‘We have got to get them.’ We tried to get out of the car but couldn’t. After the woman was escorted in, the oval turned reddish orange again and whisked off.” \nYears later in 2001, this photo would taken taken at Linda’s apartment. The aliens might have been visiting to check on her: Yancy Spence via UFO Casebook \nBoth bodyguards would later go on to suffer severe psychological maladies after seeing what they did that night. Linda still maintains her story to this day. 7. Real Life “Men in Black” Top5 \nOkay, not quite an abduction, but a bizarre visitation of another kind. \nRobert Richardson was supposedly driving through Toledo, Ohio when he drove into a strange object, which he claimed vanished the minute that he stepped out to inspect it. Remaining next to his tire, however, was a shard of metal that appeared to have been apart of the mysterious object. Richardson took the metal and continued his drive home. \nThree days later, two men in jet black suits and black sunglasses knocked on Richardson’s door. They immediately demanded the piece of metal. Richardson told them that he had it sent off to a lab for analysis. They ordered him to get it back, saying that his wife would be in grave peril if he didn’t. \nRichardson ordered them to leave, and never saw them again. 8. Barney and Betty Hill Abduction \nPerhaps one of the best known cases in UFO lore, Barney and Better Hill were allegedly abducted by aliens in 1961. \nIt all started when they were driving back home from a vacation in Canada, and they saw something they could not explain: \nAt about a quarter past 10:00 PM, three miles south of the city of Lancaster, Barney noticed what appeared to be a bright star, or planet, which seemed to move erratically. Barney pointed this out to Betty, and they both began to keep track of the object. \nThe couple began to believe that they were watching a plane appear and disappear, as the movement of their vehicle caused the trees to come and go in obstructing their view. Later, Barney would state that he tried to convince himself that the object was a plane, but that Betty thought it to be something else – an unidentified craft of some kind. \nAs the two continued to the Flume, just north of North Woodstock, the object appeared to move in an odd way. \nAs they reached Indian Head, Barney actually stopped the car to have a look at the object with his binoculars. He saw multi-colored lights, and rows of windows on a flat-shaped object, which now seemed to be moving toward him. \nAs the object moved to within a hundred feet of him, he could see occupants inside. Frightened, he ran back to his car where Betty waited. They climbed inside and sped away. Soon, two hours of their lives would vanish into oblivion. \nAfter resuming their journey home, they were not able to see the strange craft anymore. Oddly though, they heard a beeping sound. They then heard the beeping a second time, noticing that they were suddenly thirty-five miles farther down the road than a minute or two ago. They were now in Ashla. ( Source ) \nOnce they got back home, however, the strange occurrences didn’t stop. Betty forcefully insisted that their luggage be kept near the back door, their dress shoes were scuffed and scrapped, and both of their watches were broken — never to work again. \nBut it wasn’t over yet. \nBetty began having vivid dreams about the craft and strange people in it. \nIn the dreams, Betty, Barney, and the men walked up a ramp into a disc-shaped craft of metallic appearance. Once inside, Barney and Betty were separated. She protested, and was told by a man she called “the leader” that if she and Barney were examined together, it would take much longer to conduct the exams. She and Barney were then taken to separate rooms. \nBetty then dreamt that a new man, similar to the others, entered to conduct her exam with the leader. Betty called this new man “the examiner” and said he had a pleasant, calm manner. Though the leader and the examiner spoke to her in English, the examiner’s command of the language seemed imperfect and she had difficulty understanding him. ( Source ) \nAccording to Betty, she was then subjected to an examination. Afterward, she spoke to “the leader.” The Leader told Betty that she could keep a book that she found, but later insisted that he take it back, saying that “the others” wanted to wipe her mind completely. Betty told the Leader that no matter what he did, she would remember the events. \nAnd I guess she did.
