I couldn’t believe it.” \nShe was diagnosed with a carcinoma and had a tumour in her neck. \n“Before I had radiation at Westmead Hospital, I had to have nine teeth removed.” \nShe had six weeks of radiation and chemotherapy. \nA tube was inserted into her nose for eight weeks and the mother of two said it took between six months to a year to feel normal again.
