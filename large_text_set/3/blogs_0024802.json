Turns out, police say, he did it himself.\n\nKing called police Feb. 10 claiming that someone had spray-painted the swastikas on his home overnight.\n“I was horrified,” he told the Daily Gazette last month, taking a breath before and shaking his head and calling the vandalism “heartbreaking” and “painful.”\nHowever, police in Schenectady, New York, said an investigation revealed that King was the actual vandal. The 54-year-old was charged with reporting a fake crime, Sgt. Matthew Dearing told BuzzFeed News.\n\nKing pleaded not guilty Tuesday before he was sent to county jail on $500 bail, Dearing added.\nView this image › \nScreenshot from WTN / Via news10.com \nID: 10743993 King had expressed sadness and outrage over the defacement to several local media outlets. He also told the Gazette that he supported President Trump and was ridiculed for doing so.\n“People use a lot of excuses and lack civility by using Mr. Trump,” he said. “I do take jesting about Trump and sometimes I had some hard attacks about him.”\nThere are doubts as to whether King, who wore his yarmulke in several interviews, is even Jewish, according to News10 .

Dozens of Jewish community centers and institutions have received bomb threats and vandals desecrated about 100 headstones in a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia.\nAlthough Trump denounced the wave of threats and attacks last month, his administration had been criticized for taking too long to do so.\nKing had told the Gazette last month that would “ring the necks” of whoever damaged his home and would leave the swastikas up to make a statement.\n“This can show people who thrive on hate, in my opinion, that love trumps hate in the long run,” he had said.\n4.\nWave Of Bomb Threats Against Jewish Centers Soars To 100 This Year \nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10744322 5.\nAnti-Muslim And Other Hate Groups Are On The Rise, Report Warns \nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10744330 6.\nHere Are 28 Reported Racist And Violent Incidents After Donald Trump’s Victory \nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10744332", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:21:23.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
