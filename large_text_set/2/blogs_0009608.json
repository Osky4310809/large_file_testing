The article was based on speculation involving unnamed sources who told the paper that a Cuban candidacy was feared by the White House. I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.He's not smart enough to run for president! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017 Advertisement - story continues below \n— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 12, 2017 \nCuban then decided he could not leave it alone, and posted his response to Trump with one of their 2016 spats.

I like to challenge you,” he said then. “And like you said, I may go after that job some day and it could be against you. So it helps to get a head.” \nCuban took one more shot at the president when he was asked what might have prompted the latest jab from Trump.

They’ve been jabbing each other for years. @mikeluis93 Mark Cuban is a bully who is physically very soft and therefore should immediately stop wearing T shirts. No strength! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2013 \nOn Friday, Cuban said CEOs don’t have it easy when they get in the presidential cross-hairs. \n“It’s a tough situation for CEOs,” he said. \n“You want to make nice with the president because you’re a public company and you have shareholders, and it’s hard to balance doing the right financial thing versus doing what they think is the right thing, whatever your political beliefs are. It’s not an easy position to be in.” \n“Do what you think is right,” Cuban said. “Be an American citizen first.” \n“In the bigger scheme of things, our country benefits from peaceful activism a lot more than it benefits from one more shoe being sold, or one more basketball ticket being sold, for that matter. The people that say stay away from politics are the people that are looking for politics,” he added. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
