Petition \nFollowing Viacom’s announcement, environmental group Save Philippines Seas launched an online petition dubbed “No to Nickelodeon’s Underwater Theme Park in Palawan.” Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nIn less than 24 hours, close to 100,000 netizens have signed the petition against the plan. \nAnna Oposa, co-founder of Save Philippine Seas, led the campaign on Bataris.com. \n“We call on the local government of Palawan, Nickelodeon or Viacom International Media Networks and Coral World Park Undersea Resorts Inc. to junk their plan to build a 400-hectare underwater theme park in Coron,” the petition read. \n“Contrary to a press statement that the underwater theme park would advocate ocean protection, it will accomplish the exact opposite. By building artificial structures, you will undeniably damage and disrupt Palawan’s marine ecosystems – our Last Frontier,” the petition said. \n“For a television channel that targets children, Nickelodeon is setting a terrible mistake to the younger generation by taking away their right to enjoy our natural resources,” it added. \nThe petition can be accessed through social media sites Facebook and Twitter. \nMeanwhile, fishers’ group Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya) joined the call to stop the proposed Palawan underwater theme park. \n“The fisherfolk group vows to oppose and frustrate the project in order to protect the country’s marine resources and most of all, the livelihood of the fishers and the Filipino people,” Pamalakaya said in a statement. \nPamalakaya chairman Fernando Hicap said that contrary to Nickelodeon’s claim that the project will promote environmental protection, the construction of the resort and theme park would destroy Palawan’s environment and its marine and aquatic life. \nBased on the group’s records, Palawan is home to more than 300 coral species or about half of all coral species in the world, as well as breeding ground of more than 1,500 fish species in the country. – With Janvic Mateo Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:34:26.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
