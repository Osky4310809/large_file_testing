Like when you’re at work trying to come across as a professional that’s got it all together. There, there—dry your eyes and tell everyone it’s because you care so damn much. \nA new study , led by Elizabeth Baily Wolf of Harvard Business School, suggests there’s a good way to cover up the tracks of your tears. Throughout a series of five experiments, Wolf and her colleagues found that participants who said their tears were due to an emotional investment in their work were considered to be more competent than those who blamed other causes. For example, participants that said the root cause was team member conflict, or that they were “just being emotional,” were rated as less competent. So, cry at work if you have to. But if you get busted, use it as an opportunity to show what a great worker you are.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:05:37.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
