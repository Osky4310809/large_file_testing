We are so happy.\" \nWould you like to expand upon that? \nPG: \"No, it's enough.\" To watch Premier League action on your mobile now download the Football Score Centre on iPhone or Android \nIt was an emotive day, wasn't it, for the players, for the fans and for the manager as well? \nPG: \"Yes, Happy New Year.\" \nExpand upon that, tell me first of all about the red card. What were your thoughts on the red card? \nPG: \"You are the journalist. You can see it and you can explain it.\" Fernandinho fouls Johann Gudmundsson of Burnley, leading to his red card \nWell, I don't get paid to explain it. I get paid to ask you… \nPG: \"Me neither. I'm here to explain about the games and not the red cards and so on.\" \nHow did that change your thinking as a manager? \nPG: \"About what?\" \nHow did having to play with 10 players change your thinking in the game? \nPG: \"We played an amazing second half.\" \nHow did you change your tactics given that you were a player down? \nPG: \"Instead of playing 4-4-1 we played 4-3-2 because we played with 10 men against 11 in a lot of circumstances.\" \nYou made two changes at half time, when did you decide you were going to make those changes? \nPG: \"After the red card from Fernandinho.\" \nWas it a mistake not to play Aguero and Silva from the start and make so many changes? \nPG: \"Sure, sure, my mistake. I made a big mistake, you are right.\" Aguero scores past Burnley's Tom Heaton \nBut then did you turn it around by making a change? \nPG: \"I'm intelligent.\" \nHow did you enjoy it today? It obviously looks like it's been an emotive day for you… \nPG: \"Happy New Year. We won, we are so happy.\" \nWe'll leave it there, thank you. \nGuardiola's curious mood continued in his post-match press conference for the written media where he went on to talk about his future. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was left bemused when he was quizzed by journalists regarding Fernandinho’s red card against Burnley. \nHere's the full transcript... \nAny complaints about the red card? \nPG: \"Ask the referee, not me.\" Guardiola remonstrates with referee Lee Mason \nHow do you cope without two important midfield players, Fernandinho (suspension) and Gundogan (injury)? \nPG: \"We will play with another one.\" \nThat was your seventh red card of the season - do you feel there is a discipline problem? \nPG: \"The team with more ball possession. We did it, we have had a lot of disciplinary problems so now we respect what The FA decide. We try to play football, don't forget about that. My teams through my career always try to play football. I cannot control the circumstances.\" \nDo you expect a player of Fernandinho's experience to be a bit more intelligent and not dive in like he did? \nPG: \"I didn't see it, but I saw the fault [foul] for Claudio Bravo, that was definite. Now we are going to accept the three or four games [ban for Fernandinho] but remember it was a fault (for Bravo).\" Pep Guardiola tried to hype up the Man City crowd before the second half started against Burnley – but received a muted response. \n\"All around the world, the Burnley goal on Claudio Bravo is a fault [foul]. Here, and all around the world, the rules say the goalkeeper in the six-yard box cannot be touched. \n\"But okay so I have to adapt and I have to understand there are special rules here in England. Now I learn, so now we're going to play.\" \nYou said in interview with NBC you feel you are reaching the end of your career as a manager - will City be your last team? \nPG: \"It might be one of my last teams.\" \nWhy do you feel you need to retire? \nPG: \"Because I decide so.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:12:13.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
