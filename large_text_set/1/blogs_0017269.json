I was happy we could give him 60-something minutes,\" said Klopp. \n\"It was really good for him and us to get a rhythm because even Philippe Coutinho cannot be back on the pitch and immediately be 100 per cent. That is not really possible. \n\"It is very important for us and I am happy about this. We've not had 150 (pieces) of good news in the last few days but that is one of the best for sure.\" \nThe loss of Coutinho and the subsequent departure of Senegal forward Sadio Mane to the African Nations Cup has robbed Liverpool of two of their key attacking options and also put more pressure on Firmino, who has been moved from his preferred central position to do a job out wide where he has been less effective. \nIn the 13 matches he played alongside Coutinho for at least some part of the game before his injury, Firmino scored five goals. In the nine matches he played during his fellow Brazilian's absence he managed just one goal. \nSome of that can be attributed to his change of role to accommodate others, and Klopp does not subscribe to the view that Coutinho's absence has affected Firmino. \n\"We have a few players who have played nearly every game and Roberto, of course, had a few moments when he lost this ball or maybe didn't score in this situation, but he does not depend on any other player,\" the German said. \n\"It helps the whole team when Phil is in and at his best but they like each other and everyone can benefit from Phil's skills. \n\"He (Firmino) has played more on the wing because Sadio is not here and that changes things a little bit, but he is often enough in the right areas. \n\"He had a pass from Phil in the United game which was one of the best first contacts in a game I ever saw. \n\"It is good for all of us he is back but Roberto is in good shape. The most important thing is that they don't just play with each other because that makes it very predictable. \n\"They are good friends but they are footballers and don't care (about friendship). \n\"If Roberto is in the best position then Phil gives him the ball, and if not someone else gets it. That is a real partnership. \n\"Good understanding in the team helps a lot but they have a good understanding with all their team-mates and not just each other.\" \nPaul Clement admits it would be naive of Swansea to conduct their January transfer business without considering the prospect of relegation from the Premier League. \nClement has already signed three players - defender Martin Olsson, midfielder Tom Carroll and winger Luciano Narsingh - in little more than a fortnight since being appointed Swansea head coach. \nBut critics have been quick to suggest that the trio, signed for a combined cost of around BÂ£13million, are not the game-changers that rock-bottom Swansea need to avoid dropping into the Championship. \n\"I would say 90-95 per cent thinking about the players we have brought in is to have an impact now,\" Clement said ahead of Saturday's daunting trip to third-placed Liverpool. \n\"But it would be naive from my point of view, and the club's point of view, not to think beyond that, just from an economical point of view. \n\"They (Carroll and Olsson) will improve us, but we are looking at other areas for additions. \n\"It does not look hopeless, we are one point behind the team outside the relegation zone and not far behind the teams just above that as well. \n\"That can change very quickly. \n\"I don't have a figure on it (survival). We can look back at historical records and say what it takes to stay up. \n\"But I am just looking at game-to-game basis - trying to do the best we can in each and every game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T13:23:18.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
