Potter believes he was refused entry because he is gay and married. “They were rude and belittling to me,” he said. “They would call me up and then send me back to my seat.”\nHe was asked why his husband was not with him. He had his phone and wallet searched and was asked about their contents. They asked about his hometown of Olds, Alta., and why he relocated.\nPotter alleges he was then taken into a small cell where he sat for about 15 minutes.\nOfficers entered and next told him to remove his jacket, shoes and belt and to put his hands on the wall. Officers frisked him on “every part of his body,” he said.\n“I was given no reason at all,” Potter said. “I asked and they would not answer.”\nTyler Brownbridge/Windsor Star/Postmedia Network An executive order by U.S. president Donald Trump is impacting Windsor border crossing, including the Ambassador Bridge seen here in a file photo, leaving many commuters and other visa holders to seek answers about traveling to Detroit, Michigan. Soon after, he was offered a chance to speak with a supervisor. But after being told it would take an hour or two, he refused.\nPotter alleges he was taken back to his seat in the waiting area, questioned some more, before being told at around 2:30 p.m. by customs officers they were denying his entry into the U.S.\nHe was escorted back to his Jeep where he discovered his small suitcase and all his personal belongings had been dumped and strewn throughout the vehicle.\nPotter was directed back through the tunnel to Windsor.\n“I felt like I was profiled and didn’t get in because I was gay,” he said, adding that he’d done the exact same thing on previous trips across the border — made purchases and declared them. “This time I added that I had a husband.\n“I am very upset. I feel worse than being bullied or beaten up because you have no rights and couldn’t fight back.\nRelated Amid Trump travel ban, Canadian schools question future of class trips to the United States Windsor public school board forbids student trips to U.S. because of ‘unsafe’ political climate Fewer Canadians being turned away at U.S. border under Trump despite anecdotal reports “It didn’t matter how polite I was, nothing was good enough. I will never cross into the U.S. again. I have family and friends there, but they will have to come here.”\nA spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Detroit said Tuesday he could not comment on Potter’s experience at the border.\n“Due to privacy rules we can not make comments about any individual,” said Chief Ken Hammond.\n“It’s unfortunate he feels that way. There can be issues with each individual situation. He was well within his rights at any time to speak with a supervisor.”\nPotter has written a letter to local MPs and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nDax Melmer Michael Potter, who was detained and refused entry to the United States at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel Friday, March 24, 2017, is pictured at his home Tuesday, March 28, 2017. Potter believes he was refused entry because he is gay and married. He is calling for Canada to reject Bill C-23, pending legislation that would allow for U.S. Customs officers to be stationed at select Canadian airports where they would have full power.\nPotter travels frequently with his husband — including to Cuba, Dominican Republic and Barbados — and never encountered anything similar to his experience with U.S. customs in Detroit, he said.\n“My goal would be to stop this from going through and giving Americans power on our soil,” he said.\nLocal MP Brian Masse (NDP — Windsor West) said Tuesday there has been an increase recently of complaints by people in Windsor about treatment by U.S. customs at the border in Detroit.\n“Right now, such stories are happening more often than before,” he said. “We are hearing about a couple a week.”\nANDRE FORGET/QMI AGENCY NDP minister Brian Masse speaks to the media at Parliament Hill in Ottawa Wednesday Oct 21, 2010. “We have heard similar things before where there have been feelings a denial in crossing the border was based on sexual orientation.”\nMasse has expressed concerns in the past to the U.S. Ambassador to Canada. Recently, Masse’s office became aware of another case involving a family with young children detained up to six hours.\n“The reality at the end of the day is (U.S. customs) is on sovereign American land, so there is little we can do except make sure things don’t go past their mandate,” he said.\nPotter, should he wish to pursue the matter, would have to come to his office and fill out an official complaint that would launch a review of his incident at the border, Masse said.\nSome are unwilling to go that far, because it involves an intrusion into their personal lives, “but the protocol is there,” the MP said.\n“We help them make the complaint, we would track their file and what happens to that complaint,” he said.\nGiven the glaring spotlight on immigration and rule changes at U.S. border checkpoints, Masse said: “I can’t emphasis enough that everyone makes sure they have everything in order with your paperwork or electronic devices when you cross the border.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:57:39.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
