But in an ever-shifting culture, sometimes in order to take advantage of a big opportunity, you may actually have to dial your career back. This could mean a reduced title, fewer hours, or lower pay. For hard-driving, career-oriented gals, these consequences are tough to swallow. However, it's important to keep things in perspective. Sheryl Sandberg — yep that Sheryl Sandberg — noted the best career advice she ever received told her to \" look for growth ,\" first and foremost. Often, when we're comfortable in a position, it means we aren't growing like we should be. Opportunity will knock, but it rarely saunters through the door holding a tray of money and happiness with your name on it. If you're striving for more in your career there will be times of second guessing, reaching, and insecurity.\nBut simply knowing growth is in store doesn't make swallowing that smaller paycheck or lower title easy. Here are three ways to keep driving toward bigger things, even if you've found yourself (temporarily) in a smaller role.\n1. Stay Away From the Comparison Trap You've heard it before, but comparison steals your joy. No matter how tempting it is to eye your cubemate each time he or she nabs a meeting with the head honcho, step away from the side eye . Often we assume our co-workers just naturally have it all together; we imagine they have the exact same background, education, and experience that we do — they're just better at everything. This couldn't be further from the truth. When we attempt to quantify our careers and the careers of others we soon realize it's not an apples-to-apples thing.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/newsmakers/best-advice-sheryl-sandberg-received-don-t-idiot-161459450.html", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/sYUOt7-1X1xkK90SPdIRNf1NP7U/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/11/17/866/n/42301552/df8ba98b14c521c7_StockSnap_Y2P39NGLLO.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-20T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:00:16.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
