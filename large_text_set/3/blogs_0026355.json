Don’t go running to the burbs for a house, report says National Weather Service \nDenver set a record high temperature Thursday, the same day a blizzard warning was posted for parts of central and eastern Colorado. \nThe high temperature in Denver reached 77 degrees at 1:37 p.m. Thursday, breaking the previous record mark, 76 degrees on March 23 in 2012, according to the National Weather Service. \nA spring storm, however, is barreling toward Denver. \n“Don’t be fooled by the warm temperatures. It’s a very potent-looking storm, and it’s forming right over us tonight,” said Tod Dankers, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. \nA blizzard warning is in effect starting at midnight for parts of Elbert and Douglas counties, areas above 6,000 feet, including Castle Rock, Elbert, Kiowa and Larkspur. Northern El Paso County, Monument Ridge and the Rampart Range below 7,500 feet are also under the blizzard warning starting at midnight, which runs through noon Friday. \nCounties east of Denver, including eastern Adams and Arapahoe, and the cities of Bennett, Byers, Deer Trail, Agate, Hugo and Limon go under the blizzard warning at 3 a.m. \n“We’re expecting a lot of wind and rain changing to snow in the early morning,” Dankers said. “There could be quite a bit of it. We are expecting quite a bit of moisture with it.” \nSome areas could see between 5 to 10 inches of snow, the weather service reports, with winds gusting up to 55 mph Friday afternoon. Visibility will be near zero at times. \nModerate to heavy snowfall can be expected in the mountains, the foothills and along the Palmer Ridge, with the heaviest amounts along and south of of the I-70 corridor. Very strong northerly winds will develop late tonight and continue through Friday across the plains, the weather service said. Blizzard conditions will be possible from the Palmer Divide east toward Limon and north across central and eastern Adams and Arapahoe counties. \nIn Denver, 2 to 4 inches of snow is possible Friday morning, with an additional 1 to 3 inches on Friday afternoon. The chance for precipitation Friday in Denver is 90 percent. \n“It’s going to be a pretty nasty commute, with poor visibility,” Dankers said. \nThe high temperature Friday in Denver should top out at about 46 degrees. \nThe Colorado Department of Transportation will have snow crews “out in full force,” said spokeswoman Stacia Sellers. \nCrews and trucks were underway at 1 p.m. Thursday doing preparatory and maintenance work. By nightfall, CDOT expects to have 100 plows out throughout the Denver area, west along the I-70 corridor to the Eisenhower Tunnel, south to Monument Hill and east to Bennett. \nCDOT crews are expecting the brunt of the storm to hit the south metro area hard and strong. \n“Colorado weather is unpredictable, but our crews will be out there,” Sellers said. \nCDOT reminds drivers to keep a safe distance between the vehicle in front and not to pass plow trucks on the right. \nRecent warm weather has many trees in Colorado leafing out. Denver Parks & Recreation suggests that residents make sure tree branches are free and clear of utility lines before removing snow from limbs. Brooms can be used to gently tap snow from drooping limbs. Residents should not attempt to climb trees or use ladders to reach high limbs, especially in wintry weather. \nThe storm will be powerful but should be short, likely exiting the area Friday night into Saturday morning. Saturday in Denver should be mostly sunny, with a high temperature of 62 degrees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:07:31.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
