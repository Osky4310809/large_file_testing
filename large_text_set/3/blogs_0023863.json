He said that she has \"multiple skull fractures\" and that \"we need a miracle.\" Ross told TMZ that Jane was riding her Vespa without a helmet to the gym near their home in Oklahoma. She was hit by another vehicle and struck her head. She was rushed to a local hospital in critical condition and underwent surgery.\nRoss told TMZ that the situation \"touch and go\" at the moment and that \"it could be a tough day.\" \nOur thoughts and encouragement are with Jan and J.R.. My wife Jan, my little angel, was hit while riding her Vespa & has multiple skull fractures. She's in surgery now. We need a miracle.  Jim Ross (@JRsBBQ) March 21, 2017 \nFollow Raj Giri on Twitter at @RajGiri_303 . Got a news tip or correction? Send it to us by clicking here .
