FOOTBALL GOSSIP \nCeltic goalkeeper Craig Gordon, 34, wants to hold talks with Chelsea over a move to Stamford Bridge. The Premier League leaders contacted the Scottish champions with an offer of about £2.5m to purchase the Scotland international on Thursday morning. (Daily Mail) \nHowever, Celtic say Gordon is not for sale. Manager Brendan Rodgers insists: \"Craig is very much a part of what I am doing here. He is 34 years old and can go on for a number of years yet and can be a real pillar of this team.\" (Evening Express) Eboue Kouassi was keen to point out that Kouassi is indeed his surname, not his first name \nFormer Celtic striker Charlie Nicholas believes the club should offer Gordon an improved deal. He says: \"Celtic should put Gordon on a contract that reflects his talents, his worth to the Rodgers revolution and make the decision to stay in Glasgow a formality. At the moment, Celtic have a keeper they know can do the job and who is settled at the club. Why allow that situation to change?\" (Daily Express) \nRangers manager Mark Warburton has told Kenny Miller, 37, and Clint Hill, 38, he can't do any more to get them new deals and it's now up to the Rangers chairman Dave King to make them an offer. (Daily Record) \nRangers must ditch one of their four centre-halves to sign West Ham's Reece Oxford, 18, on loan. He currently has Danny Wilson, Rob Kiernan, Clint Hill and Philippe Senderos for the position. (Sun) \nMotherwell manager Mark McGhee has revealed that Australian striker Scott McDonald was on the bench against Rangers last Saturday because a potential move back home had left \"his head all over the place\". (National) \nCeltic defender Dedryck Boyata has responded well to advice from Brendan Rodgers but says he has been helped through a tough period at the club by Kolo Toure. \"The good thing about Kolo is he is a person with a very good spirit. He doesn't like to lose,\" says the Belgian. (Sun) \nThe Scottish Professional Football League is set to crack down on clubs who refuse to pay players the national minimum wage. (Daily Record) Esmael Goncalves played for St Mirren for the tail end of season 2012-13 \nSt Mirren manager Jack Ross has re-signed midfielder Stephen McGinn. The 28-year-old spent the first four seasons of his career at Paisley before moving to Watford and Sheffield United. (Sun) \nIvorian midfielder Eboue Kouassi, 19, has brought his mum to Glasgow to help him settle after his £2.8m transfer from Russian club Karasnodar. (Herald) \nAnorthosis Famagusta expect to agree Esmael Goncalves' transfer to Hearts in the next 24 hours for about £175,000. (Scotsman) OTHER GOSSIP \nCommonwealth light-welterweight champion Josh Taylor is keen to emulate the American success of fellow Scotsman Ken Buchanan and bring titles back to Edinburgh.
