And if the video above is anything to go by, it will be worth every penny. \nConstruction for the 'New White Hart Lane' began in July and it included a corner of the north Londoners' current stadium being demolished. \nIt also meant that Spurs had to play this season's Champions League games at Wembley due to certain UEFA restrictions. \nBut two seasons of hardship will surely be worth it when Spurs move into their new lavish 61,000 seater stadium.
