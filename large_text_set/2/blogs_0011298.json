Consumers in the US have been waiting as well, but at least for T-Mobile variants of the S7 and S7 edge that were running the beta, Nougat is now being sent out over the air. \nThe update brings all the features one expects from Samsung’s version of Nougat, including the February 1 security patch (keep in mind that the devices that were updated earlier are on the January 1 security patch). The OTA is sized at around 115 MB for both the S7 and S7 edge; naturally, those who didn’t participate in the beta will see a much larger update at some point in the near future. February 24th is apparently the date for the general rollout for devices still on Marshmallow. \nThe full Android 7.0 Nougat firmware should be showing up on Samsung Smart Switch and in our firmware database once the update goes live for everyone on T-Mobile, and we will be sure to inform you when that happens. In the meantime, check out this video to see all the new features and take a look at a few tips and tricks to get the most out of your Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge on Nougat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:28:20.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
