Ryding describes his rise to world class slalom star as “insane” (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nThe 30-year-old has racked up four top ten finishes this season after deciding five years ago to concentrate only on slalom racing, and forget about the downhill and Super-G. \nHe said: “Slalom was my best. With my coaches, we decided to put all our eggs in one basket. I’ve doubled my slalom training load, and it has worked. It is mentally demanding, but I love it.” \nRyding, who was 17th at the Olympics in Sochi says of his breakthrough year: “If the season stopped now, I’d be over the moon.” \nHe coped with the pressure of being in contention in Kitzbuhel joking: “It was a roller coaster of emotions but I’ve lead a few dry slope races back in the UK so its kind of the same thing right?! Ryding has been focused on Slalom success for the past five years (Photo: AFP) \n“It felt like a win and it’s something I’ll remember for the rest of my life. \n“I didn’t start training on snow till I was 12. I was at least eight years behind the Austrians, who are on skis almost as soon as they can walk. Slalom is a real skill-based discipline and I’ve always been playing catch-up. \n\"Training is a year round job. A good winter of racing is set up with five hours a day of physical work in the summer.

In the afternoon at around 4pm, I’ll go to the gym and do a workout. \n“I mix squats with deadlifts for around two hours and follow that with an hour working on my core muscles and balance. I do sit-ups and use the fit ball for balance. \n“I work out for five hours every day, but take Sunday off to give my body time to rest and allow me to spend time doing other things, catching up with mates or just chilling out.” \nThis Sunday will be his biggest race yet. A long way from the kid who started on the Pendle dry slop so his parents would take him on their annual ski holiday. \nHe said: “I’ll just keep trying, that’s all I can do.” \nHe’s already done rather well... for an Englishman. poll loading Do you think Dave Ryding will be crowned world champion? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:40:34.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
