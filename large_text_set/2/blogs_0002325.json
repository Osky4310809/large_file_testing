Arjuna Capital and Baldwin Bros. filed the shareholder resolution in collaboration with OpenMIC, a nonprofit organization (co-founded by one of Arjuna Capital's managing partners) that works with investors on net neutrality and digital privacy issues.\nThe shareholder resolution cites a Pew report that found that 64 percent of Americans are confused by fake news stories and a Buzzfeed story which found that fake news headlines were more popular than real news stories on Facebook. The resolution warns that the prevalence of fake news on Facebook poses a number of risks to the company — including government regulation and fines and a loss in reputation that could lead users to abandon the platform.\nAs a first step in dealing with the fake news epidemic, the resolution calls for Facebook to produce a detailed report on the issue.\n\"Shareholders request Facebook issue a report (at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary or legally privileged information) reviewing the public policy issues associated with fake news enabled by Facebook,\" the shareholder resolution states. \"The report should review the impact of current fake news flows and management systems on the democratic process, free speech, and a cohesive society, as well as reputational and operational risks from potential public policy developments.\"\nArjuna managing partner Natasha Lamb told POLITICO that the issue of fake news is complex, and Facebook's shareholders and users have a right to know the details about how Facebook is attempting to deal with the issue and what impact it could have on the company's business.\n\"They haven't addressed the public policy issue,\" she said. \"They haven't addressed the censorship issue. They haven't addressed the reputation issue in a substantial way. They really dismissed it, at first. There's lots of intricacies into how they're dealing with this, whether they're impinging on free speech rights, whether they're censoring, whether they're creating systemic bias every time they tweak their algorithm.\"\nFacebook has not yet responded to the resolution. If the company takes no action, then shareholders will be able to vote to approve or reject the resolution at Facebook's annual shareholder meeting in June. Facebook could also just agree to produce the report before the shareholder meeting, in which case Arjuna and Baldwin would withdraw the resolution. Or Facebook could try to fight the resolution, arguing to the SEC that it is already taking steps to combat the spread of fake news and thus the resolution should not be put on the ballot at the shareholder meeting.\nArjuna filed a similar shareholder resolution with Google parent company Alphabet in December 2016. Google has not yet responded to the resolution, so it is likely to be put up for a ballot at Alphabet's annual shareholder meeting in June.\nArjuna and Baldwin are small investment firms — the former controls about $200 million in assets, the latter just under $1 billion — but Lamb said that they are often to punch above their weight by introducing shareholder resolutions on issues that are relevant to other investors.\nIn addition to its current crusade against fake news, Arjuna is waging a shareholder activism campaign to get large tech companies to commit to gender pay equity. That campaign has been fairly successful; Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and others (but not Facebook or Alphabet) have released data about the gender pay gap and committed to taking steps to close it.", "external_links": ["http://arjuna-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Fake-News-Proposal_Facebook.pdf"], "published": "2017-02-02T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:30:17.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
