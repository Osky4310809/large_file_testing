By Jason Samenow January 5 at 4:56 PM Follow @capitalweather \nThe first measurable snowfall of the season is expected across the metro region tonight, but will it be enough to delay or close schools? Probably not. [ An inch or so of snow possible in parts of D.C. area tonight, slick spots possible ] \nGenerally, just a dusting to an inch is likely in our southern areas and perhaps an inch or so in our northern areas. Although it doesn’t take much to disrupt schools in the D.C. area, an inch or less probably isn’t quite enough to make it happen. \nThe case for delays is further hurt by the fact that the snow may end as soon as 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., giving crews time to clear roads. \nStill, there’s a small chance of some localized heavier snow totals to the tune of two to three inches, mainly in our northern suburbs. \nSo while less than 50-50, we think there’s a fighting chance of delayed openings in Loudoun, Montgomery, Howard and Frederick counties. \nBottom line: Do your homework. School is likely to open on time Friday for most of the region. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:12:20.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
