And now that we've seen it, both us and toads can never go back.\nIt all starts with Mr. Toad, who would show up day after day on Chris Newsome's porch in the summer.\nSEE ALSO: Just a load of animals with pancakes because humans are weird\n\"The toad would sit on my front porch every night during the summer,\" Newsome explained. \"He lives under the daisies in my flower bed and he would come to the porch to eat bugs.\"\nImage: 1158PM/IMGUR\nSince the toad became a regular visitor, Newsome dubbed him Mr. Toad (although he isn't completely sure that the toad is male). And although Mr. Toad may not have been ready, he was about to become the center of a child's delight.\n\"A friend of mine has a little boy that lost his pet toad,\" Newsome said. \"He was crying about his toad and he remembered Mr. Toad. He asked if Mr. Toad was still coming to visit me every night, so to make him feel better I sent him a photo to show that Mr. Toad was alive and well.\"\nNewsome then decided to take it to the next level.\n\"I started making the hats to cheer him up because all kids would laugh at a toad with a hat.\"\nThat's just what he did and kids weren't the only ones to laugh.\nImage: 1158pm/imgur\nd\nImage: 1158PM/IMGUR\nImage: 1158PM/IMGUR\nNewsome's posts on Reddit and Imgur about Mr. Toad gained a ton of attention.\n\"The toad never seemed to mind the hats,\" Newsome said. \"I would just place them on its head and it would just sit there.\"\nHe sent us a GIF showing just how chill the toad is donning its fresh new look.\nMr Toad getting a hat\n\"I made the hats out of foam paper. I had never made any type of hat before, so it was a quick 'wing it' as you go design,\" Newsome said. \"I just cut the foam paper and folded it until it until it seemed like a hat.\"\nImage: 1158pm/imgur\n\"Hopefully, the toad will return this season,\" Newsome said about Mr. Toad's potential future. \"I'll make sure to make some new hats. If he does (or another one comes to the porch) I'll definitely take more photos.\"\nAll the best, Mr. Toad. We hope you are doing well.\nWATCH: Doggy tour bus shows adventurous pups the sights of London", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hTFywCUckszz2kAoVaeaSCma0NE=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410805%2F44380d02-3b8c-4d0b-a10d-93ab1b935a1f.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/tvYZMque.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/a-E-oC_E4LRAohGvI94vbUvqNJA=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410807%2F66fcd265-f933-4e47-87dc-5fca98e24d7a.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Qt0nV-oykqW2MYIlEOaIfYOsfIY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410805%2F44380d02-3b8c-4d0b-a10d-93ab1b935a1f.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zaboXjIVDCTELsC2zwUkmRPcy7E=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410809%2F9c281b89-ef97-44b8-ab06-3ef7c8f08311.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/N6RA9ef7O7eSgkDi9FecWTTu-Pg=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410799%2F7e115cd5-f537-4b9c-8aa7-bf47aad53191.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/07Z4qgWK4OOtmxflWGPhingjqaA=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410816%2F616e5a20-608e-4592-9104-d66ef9ace457.jpg", "https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/5yjebe/toad_on_my_porch_needed_a_hat_so_i_made_him_one/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GNwOIzgBJNtikLGSiDEjdSiZ3-M=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410799%2F7e115cd5-f537-4b9c-8aa7-bf47aad53191.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ptCnOL9phYWSj33tczLZymJdpH0=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410807%2F66fcd265-f933-4e47-87dc-5fca98e24d7a.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/tvYZMque.m3u8", "https://imgur.com/a/4BVrs", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7t2hqW1TQdpEsIrv0EYgx3ClKrI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410816%2F616e5a20-608e-4592-9104-d66ef9ace457.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iEK2dyBmTJZ_D8AVFuNIkcvseZQ=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410809%2F9c281b89-ef97-44b8-ab06-3ef7c8f08311.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-11T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:45:27.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
