As great as PS Now sounds on paper, its pricing has always left much to be desired. At $19.99 for one month and $44.99 for three months, it’s an expensive service — especially when you consider that you don’t get to keep any of the games. Thankfully, something better just came along.\nMicrosoft has just announced Xbox Game Pass . For $9.99 a month, Xbox One owners will have access to 100 Xbox games. This isn’t a streaming service either. Users will be able to download full games onto their Xbox One. Also, every game on Xbox Game Pass and its add-ons can be purchased at a discount by subscribers. Like Netflix, new games will be cycled in and out.\nThere will be titles from publishers such as 2K, 505 Games, BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment, Capcom, Codemasters, Deep Silver, Focus Home Interactive, SEGA, SNK CORPORATION, THQ Nordic GmbH, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and of course, Microsoft Studios. Some of the specific games that will be available on Xbox Game Pass when it launches in Spring are Halo 5: Guardians , Payday 2 , NBA 2K16 and SoulCalibur II .\nStarting today, Microsoft will test Xbox Game Pass with select members from the Xbox Insider Program in an Alpha Preview ring. These testers will have access to a small sample of titles. Xbox Live Gold members will get exclusive access to Xbox Game Pass before the program is launched.\nRight now, Xbox Game Pass is only available for the Xbox One. When PCGamesN contacted Microsoft about this, the company responded by saying: “The Xbox One and PC icons appear on the Xbox Game Pass description page because you can redeem on console, web, and PC. However, Xbox Game Pass is only available on Xbox One consoles.”\nOverall, this sounds like a great service for Xbox owners. If it is successful, perhaps Sony will rethink how PlayStation Now works. As things stand at the moment, Xbox Game Pass is superior to PlayStation Now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T15:02:07.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
