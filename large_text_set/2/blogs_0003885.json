Whether it’s singing along to the Beauty and the Beast or making a Frozen references whenever we’re presented with the opportunity, it’s safe to say that Disney Princesses are a very important part of our lives, which makes the newest news out of Disney super exciting. Disney just announced that they’re teaming up with subscription toy company Pley for their new Disney Princess PleyBox . \nA new Disney Princess PleyBox arrives every two months with a combination of toys, accessories, shirts, other new items. Umm, sign us up! \n\nLaunching the PleyBox is a limited edition Beauty and the Beast inspired PleyBox . Inside the box, are figures of Belle, Gaston, Beast, Lumiere and Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts, a book of stories about Belle, and an adorable t-shirt. At $24.99 per box, this seems like an amazing deal. \nDisney Another cool part of the Disney Princess PleyBox is the the reusable box . The boxes can be transformed into castles reflecting the princess inside the box. We hope there are instructions included! \n\n“Instead of throwing the packaging away, our physical shipping boxes become a part of the princesses’ story. Each box has instructions that transform the shipping box into a playable toy such as a castle, boat or a carriage that can be decorated and played with. We call it ‘Pleycycle,’ and are proud to be a leader in reducing the environmental footprint of toy packaging,” Pley CEO Ranan Lachman explained in the press release. \nWe love how the PleyBoxes are not only amazing on the inside but they’re super sustainable! \n\nDisney princesses are literally the most magical role models and we love that now we get the opportunity to buy a Disney Princess PleyBox and read new stories and create our own stories with our fave Disney princesses.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:00:29.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
