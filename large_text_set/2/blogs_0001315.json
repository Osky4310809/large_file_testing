Johnson | USA TODAY Sports Images Rice head coach Mike Rhodes (right) makes use of deft scheming and play-calling to help his team to victory. College basketball: How teams win the scoring battle after a timeout Brian Mull | NCAA.com Contact | Archive | RSS Mike Rhodes is in his third season as the coach at Rice. He’s trying to build a winner at a program unfamiliar with winning. In 103 seasons, Rice has lost 57 percent of its games. The Owls haven’t been to the NCAA tournament since 1970. They’ve finished with one winning record since 2005 and enjoyed just two 20-win seasons since Eisenhower was president. MARCH MADNESS ON SOCIAL MEDIA JOIN THE TEAM. Follow @marchmadness At this point in the process, Rhodes lacks the personnel to beat the better teams in Conference USA, not to mention some of Rice's non-conference opponents. Stealing possessions and manufacturing points are imperative. How? Taking open shots in transition is one route. Another? Winning the scoring battle coming out of a timeout. Executing and scoring on those 10-12 possessions per game is a priority for Rhodes and his staff, and the numbers reveal they’re excelling at it. According to Synergy Sports Technology data, the Owls are second in the nation in offensive efficiency after a timeout, scoring 1.081 points per possession (ppp), trailing only the turbo-charged offensive juggernaut of UCLA. Rice is 14-8 this season -- that's already the most wins the program has had since 2011-12 -- with nine games remaining in the regular season. The Owls are 127th in KenPom, their best ranking since 2005. Chuck Cook | USA TODAY Sports Images Rice Owls guard Marcus Jackson (22) is one of only four upperclassmen (one senior) on this team. Their success out of timeouts starts with communication. “Are we listening in the timeout? Are we going to do what we just talked about?” Rhodes says. “It’s a pet peeve of mine when guys walk out of a timeout and look at each other and say, ‘What are we doing?’ We have a real quick message in our timeout -- one voice. So in the huddle, assistants speak real quick, make their point, then let’s have one voice on one page so when we walk out, we’re executing.” NCAA.com explored the Synergy data to identify teams that thrive exiting a timeout, then looked at teams whose post-timeout performance exceeds their efficiency the rest of the game. In many cases, the teams that are best in scoring or defending out of timeouts are simply good throughout the game. UCLA is scoring with amazing efficiency out of a timeout, at 1.083 ppp. No. 1 Gonzaga leads the nation in points allowed out of a timeout, at .536 ppp. (Then again, the Zags are also second in the nation in halfcourt defense, at .729 ppp. Scoring against coach Mark Few’s club is difficult. Period.) Possessions after timeouts account for 15-18 percent of possessions in a game. The worst teams score around .7 ppp. Average teams score around .85 ppp. The best score more than 1.0 ppp. And there are many teams who execute better within seconds of receiving advice from the coaching staff. Rice, for example scores .95 points on all halfcourt possessions (41st in the nation). “We try to always be prepared for a man-to-man or zone play,” he says. “Let’s not panic if they change defense, go to man, zone or trap. We practice that, talk about it. Our guys are better because it’s an emphasis.” \nTop 10 - points per possession after a timeout Team", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T22:45:56.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
