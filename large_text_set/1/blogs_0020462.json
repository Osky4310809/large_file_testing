She is an Islamic fanatic and your best case scenario with her is she kills you last. @sallykohn \n— Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) January 24, 2017 \nUh-oh, Sally. This might be a good time to check his bio to see what else Kurt did for a living… I feel sad for you and everyone who thinks like you. It must be hard having your heart filled with so much blind hatred. https://t.co/Tyso6rrMQw \n— Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) January 24, 2017 \n“Blind hatred, she says.” And she fell into the trap: Hi @sallykohn . Here's me showing my \"blind hatred\" while deployed away from my family protecting Muslims from genocide. Where's your pic? pic.twitter.com/JRwUTxjE0q \n— Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) January 25, 2017 \nOver to you, Sally: When have you helped stop a genocide?
