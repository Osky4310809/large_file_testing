Pardoning the dead is fine. Better to say sorry to the living | Catherine Bennett Read more \nThe general pardon is modelled on the 2013 royal pardon granted by the Queen to Alan Turing , the mathematician who broke the German Enigma codes during the second world war. He killed himself in 1954, at the age of 41, after his conviction for gross indecency. \nWelcoming the legislation, the justice minister, Sam Gyimah, said: “This is a truly momentous day. We can never undo the hurt caused, but we have apologised and taken action to right these wrongs. I am immensely proud that ‘Turing’s law’ has become a reality under this government.” \nThere is already a procedure in place for the living to apply to the Home Office to have their past convictions, relating to same-sex relationships, expunged from their criminal records. \nUnder what is known as the disregard process, anyone previously found guilty of past sexual offences that are no longer criminal matters can ask to have them removed. \nA disregard can be granted only if the past offence was a consensual relationship and both men were over 16. The conduct must also not constitute what remains an offence of sexual activity in a public lavatory. Sam Gyimah, justice minister, says the government has ‘taken action to right these wrongs’.

Those granted a disregard will also be pardoned. \nNo lists of past pardons will be published but the new law will allow future historians to point out that those imprisoned or fined for consensual gay relationships would not under modern legislation have committed a crime. \nRewriting history will not be easy. The complexity of the evidence, for example, that led to Oscar Wilde’s conviction in 1895 for gross indecency – including evidence of procuring male prostitutes – would make it difficult to assess. \nThe gay rights organisation Stonewall has suggested the playwright and author, who was sentenced to two years hard labour in Reading jail, should be entitled to a pardon. \nThe justice ministry said there would be no historical limit in relation to past offences. It declined, however, to say whether Wilde would be among those deemed posthumously pardoned. \nThe amendments to the bill were tabled by Lord Sharkey, Lord Cashman and Lord Lexden with government support. A private member’s bill with a similar aim and a blanket pardon, brought forward by the SNP MP, John Nicolson, was not supported by the government. It would have backdated pardons only to 1919. \nA Stonewall spokesperson said: “This is significant. And it’s as important to the whole lesbian, gay, bi and trans community, as it is for the gay and bi men affected. \n“The more equality is enshrined into our law books, the stronger our equality becomes, and the stronger we as a community become. Posthumous pardons law may see Oscar Wilde exonerated Read more \n“This month the government issued a clear and powerful apology to every gay and bi man who had been unjustly criminalised for being who they are. This is not just equality for gay and bi men; the passing of this law is justice. \n“We’re working to ensure that this new process is brought quickly and correctly, and to ensure all gay and bi men unjustly persecuted and prosecuted can finally receive the justice they deserve.” \nWelcoming the new law, the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: “This pardon is an important, valuable advance that will remedy the grave injustices suffered by many of the estimated 50,000 to 100,000 men who were convicted under discriminatory anti-gay laws between 1885 and 2003 – the latter being the year when all homophobic sexual offences legislation was finally repealed in England and Wales. \n“A pardon has connotations of forgiveness for a wrong done. These men and the wider LGBT community believe they did no wrong. \n“The legislation has a few omissions. It does not explicitly allow for the pardoning of men convicted of soliciting and procuring homosexual relations under the 1956 and 1967 Sexual Offences Acts. Nor does it pardon those people, including some lesbians, convicted for same-sex kissing and cuddling under laws such as the Public Order Act 1986, the common law offence of outraging public decency, the Town Police Clauses Act 1847, the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860 and the Army, Navy and Air Force Acts and other diverse statutes. \n“However, agreements secured by Lord Cashman mean that people convicted under these other laws can also apply for a pardon.” \nThe last men who were executed for homosexuality in England were James Pratt and John Smith who were hanged in 1835.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T19:30:09.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
