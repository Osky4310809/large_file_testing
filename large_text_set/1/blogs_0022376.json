Cisco Ramon , what have you gotten yourself into. After The Flash returned tonight with an electrifying episode, it looks like some heat is being taken off of Barry and being shoveled onto Cisco. The newbie metahuman offers himself up to a rather intimidating bounty hunter named Gypsy when she comes looking for Harrison. And, when the poor guy challenges her to combat for the elder’s freedom, things go about as well as planned. \nOr, as Harrison so eloquently put it, she’s going to kill Cisco. However, if the boy’s training with Barry has anything to say, then Cisco may come out of the encounter alive. \nYou can check out the episode’s synopsis below: \n“H.R.’s (Tom Cavanagh) past catches up with him when a bounty hunter with vibe powers named Gypsy (guest star Jessica Camacho) arrives in Central City to bring him back to Earth-19 to stand trial for his crime. It turns out inter-dimensional travel is illegal on their Earth. H.R. surrenders but when Barry (Grant Gustin) and Cisco (Carlos Valdes) find out that H.R.’s only hope would be to challenge Gypsy to a fight to the death, they intercede and Cisco offers to fight Gypsy instead.” \nHarry Jierjian directed the episode with story by Benjamin Raab and Deric A. Hughes and teleplay by Zack Stentz \nIf you’re looking for a way to satiate your appetite for The Flash, then you can check out ComicBook.com’s ‘Flashback,’ an aftershow dedicated to the hit series. Flashback will air at 9 PM ET on ComicBook.com's Facebook page, with new episodes airing Tuesday nights after each new hour of the CW series.
