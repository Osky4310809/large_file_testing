The only reason Verizon is offering this plan is to get consumers used to the idea of downloading 22gb/month. When 5G becomes mainstream, people will be burning through 22gb faster than ever. If you think you’re the type of person that would never use 22gb, think again. And when you hit your 22gb/month limit, you run the risk of being throttled down to 3g. I’m not taking the bait. I’m sticking with my original unlimited data plan. I’m sure Verizon will find some creative way to force me off my OG Unlimited plan. Me \nMight have to make the switch. Just waiting on a pixel deal mcdonsco \nCan someone please explain to me why anyone would need 1gbps speeds on their phone? Really, seriously? \nI would MUCH rather see a massive expansion and reduction of congestion on the 4g network so instead of 7mb down / 2mb up most of the time we could all see 80+mb down and 30+mb up all the time. \nBut, progress with specs just for the sake of progress and specs. Whatever. \nAt some point speed needs to take a backseat (being more than fast enough) to range, coverage and consistency in the speed across most devices and locations. The Doctor \nPeople said the same thing about 4G. mcdonsco \nKnew someone would say this, to which I would say, no, no they didn’t. Speeds on 3g were largely in KB not mb, as such there was a definite need for speed. The Doctor \nI’d love to download a full-size movie while waiting in line at the grocery store. mcdonsco \nOK, besides the point of, you can now depending on location (full bars or one bar). \nWhy? \nAren’t you in transit after? Can’t wait a few minutes for the every once in a while 1gb+ file? \nWhy does everything have to be instant in dense urban areas and slow as crap everywhere else? Why not balance it out, where anywhere you go is equally fast? Makes a lot more sense to me. Then you could download your movie in line, or while waiting for your water to boil at the campsite. \nRight now, it’s download in line and barely able to make a call much less use any data at the campsite which to me, is stupid. ck125 \nHeck no. 3G on verizon was dreadfully slow. LTE4G \nI don’t think this is intended for phones directly – The idea being point to point broadband for homes/businesses to compete with Cable/DSL/Fiber. 5G! \nWill you be ‘upgrading’ your username? ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nhttps://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd89a1e451a2563b3ea44d6f244133b768d3b7c9511c65e94d613e67b8b63b1b.jpg Kris Stewart \nThe faster speed actually reduces the air time used by each transmission easing congestion for more devices. Hopefully this will open the door to affordable internet at good speeds for rural broadband. Of course using affordable and Verizon together is rather optimistic. mcdonsco \nReasonable enough…But then with any new network you have coverage issues for years to come…Why not just reduce congestion and increase FAST speeds coverage on the existing tech first? A lot cheaper, and expansion to cover rural areas would be a lot faster and cheaper. \nJust seems like we’re always too focused on speed and at some point need to shift the focus to coverage/range etc. \nI have the same issue with wifi routers…SPEED SPEED SPEED!!!! while range is pure crap. Cjkdajfkjda \nWhat network are you on? mcdonsco \nWas cricket, used T-Mobile for a while and back on Verizon as of their new unlimited plans. Cliff Keene \nClearly you know not how Verizon tries to sucker people in with 5GVOLTEABC123NOWYOUANDME…..Sorry mis-share. Kris Stewart \nSpeed is the marketing side of it for sure. They do need more incentive to expand rural coverage. Working with verizon tower guys at times they have been deploying all new towers with only new wireless bands and leaving out the old bands. Preparing for this in outlying areas. I am around the Springfield MO area and Verizon deployed small cells on towers throughout the city (hundreds). Test site to use for 5G as home broadband I have a feeling. Me \nIdk, sounds kinda communist to me ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nBecause when the network is congested you can get something like 90mbps down mcdonsco \nWhich 4g is capable of now. Seems to me reducing congestion and increasing coverage through expansion of 4g makes a lot more sense. \nAt some point in the very near future, sure, we will need those speeds, but for now what we really need is just better overall coverage and reduction in congestion. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nBest I’ve ever got was ~60 down and ~50 up ck125 \nI saw 160 down the other day. mcdonsco \nYup. mcdonsco \nI’ve seen over 100mb many times on both Verizon and T-Mobile … Depends on where you are, signal strength etc which is EXACTLY my point. Genkidama \nReduced latency to 1ms according to the white papers is the reason I would take 5g any day. Far superior to 4g transmission speeds. ggareis \nThis isn’t about faster speeds for your phone. It’s more about fixed wireless broadband. Their calling it wireless fiber. The most expensive part of rolling out Fios is running the last mile to Homes and businesses. 5g is the answer to this problem. billiebob808 \nYou’re absolutely right. But the carriers don’t care about that (or I should say it’s not as high a priority as 5G). It’s all about the marketing angle. They’re racing to become “the first” or “the best” 5G carrier evar. Verizon can claim the most coverage in their ads all they want, but once AT&T says “ALL NEW 5G,” then people will flock to them. So it becomes an arms race for marketing (i.e. bragging) rights.
