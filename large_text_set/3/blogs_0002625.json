Conservatives voiced concerned about tax credits in the plan, which they feel create another entitlement program. But a second draft bill, which leaked to the press Friday shows significant changes have been made to the initial version of the legislation. \n“The health care committees in Congress worked over the weekend with the White House to tie up loose ends and incorporate technical guidance from the administration. Saturday there was also a call with the speaker, Chairman Walden, Director Mulvaney, Secretary Price, Andrew Bremberg, and others, and House and Senate staff worked throughout the day to close out open issues,” the GOP aide continued. “We are in a very good place right now, and while drafting continues, we anticipate the release of final bill text early this week.” \nTop GOP lawmakers in both the House and Senate said they are aiming to have an Obamacare repeal bill passed through the reconciliation process before Easter recess. And, if the bill makes it out of committee next week as planed, they should be right on schedule. \n“We are now at the culmination of a years-long process to keep our promise to the American people,” Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong told TheDCNF in a statement.
