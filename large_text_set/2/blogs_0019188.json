The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to allow the ban to go forward. The move has caused Trump to criticize the judicial system at various times. \nThe new executive order is expected to be rolled out some time this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:42:25.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
