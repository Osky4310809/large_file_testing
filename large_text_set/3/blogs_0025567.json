It will exclude Energy Transfer Partners, Enbridge Energy Partners, Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum from its investments. \nIt is the latest victory for the divestment campaign that has seen a number of investors and pension funds cut ties with companies dealing with Energy Transfer Partners’ pipeline. \nThe Standing Rock Sioux and others have protested the 1,900-kilometer (about 1,180-mile) pipeline’s route under the Missouri river’s Lake Oahe and land it deems bound by treaty. \nOther Norwegian companies have already divested from companies involved in the pipeline. Nordea Bank AB sold its bonds in three companies in February, and Storebrand financial group said it would divest earlier this month. — WECAN, International (@WECAN_INTL) March 24, 2017 \nA delegation of indigenous women from Standing Rock and its allies were headed to Norway on Friday for a week-long mission to engage with financial institutions, media and civil society groups and share concerns and experiences from the Standing Rock resistance effort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T05:59:55.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
