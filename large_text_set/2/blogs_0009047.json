The protest had been organised by Pakistan’s pharmaceuticals industry. \n“Apparently it was a suicide blast but police are still investigating to know the exact nature of [it],” a Punjab police spokesman, Nayab Haider, said. \nA spokesman for Jamaat-ur-Ahrar, a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, called Reuters and claimed responsibility for the attack. Police and security officers cordon off the scene of the explosion in Lahore. Photograph: K.M. Chaudary/AP \nThe group had also claimed responsibility for a blast last Easter in a park in Lahore that killed more than 70 people. \nSecurity in the country has improved in recent years but Islamist groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and Islamic State still pose a threat and have carried out mass attacks. \nThe prime minister vowed the attacks would not weaken Pakistan’s resolve in fight against militancy. \n“We have fought this fight against the terrorists among us, and will continue to fight it until we liberate our people of this cancer, and avenge those who have laid down their lives for us,” Nawaz Sharif said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T17:22:34.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
