ADVERTISEMENT \nTrump concedes, “I also understand that’s politics. And in terms of him being behind things, that’s politics. And it will probably continue.” \nHe says he’s not surprised, saying “I’m changing things that (Obama) wanted to do.” Trump said he’s tougher than Obama in terms of his efforts to deport anyone living in the country illegally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:26:33.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
