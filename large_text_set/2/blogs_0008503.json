All the 13 Local Governments and 18 Development Areas were involved in this illegality. \n“We want to warn that we shall no longer accept it,” Mr Tete Jatau, the NUT Chairman, told newsmen, on Monday in Lafia. He said that the union would be forced to take drastic action if the situation persisted. *Pupils listen with rapt attention in their ‘modernised’ classroom \nJatau said that some Education Secretaries had claimed that the deducted monies were for the payment of union’s check-up dues. “The union’s check-up dues are usually deducted from the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs before salaries are sent to the local governments. So, we do not know of any other deduction,” he said. \nThe official explained that the only legitimate deductions from member’s salaries were union dues, and declared that no one had the right to effect further deductions. Jatau advised education secretaries to always confide in the union before making deductions so as to avoid “hard consequences”. \nNUT official enjoined primary school teachers to be dedicated to their duties and assured them of the union’s determination to protect their interests.
