The final toll won’t be available for another six weeks, but Allegheny County Medical Examiner Dr. Karl Williams projects that about 500 people will have died from drug overdoses in 2016. \nKDKA’s Andy Sheehan: “And it’s getting worse?” \nDr. Williams: “It is still getting worse, yes. We have not seen the peak of the crisis. We haven’t seen any evidence so far that it’s even leveling off.” \nThe epidemic has taken the lives of addicts like Kevin Meininger who died in August of a heroin overdose. It has upended the lives of their families forever. \n“He was my baby. We were very close. Just having him gone, it’s too hard,” said Maureen Hendershot, Kevin’s mom. \nHendershot says Kevin made several tries at beating his addiction, but addicts says that heroin is readily available in towns throughout the region and pull is often too great. \n“He was in three or four different rehabs. Did good once he got out and came back home to Pitcairn, right back, right back,” said Hendershot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T12:37:56.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
