Here are seven examples of the character’s and the comic strip’s influence. Popeye’s Obsession With Spinach Popularized the Vegetable With Kids \nPopeye’s obsession with spinach, which gave him strength, so popularized the food that Crystal City, Texas — the self-proclaimed Spinach Capital of the World — erected a statue in honor of the Sailor Man. He Was the Inspiration for Donkey Kong and Mario \nThe video game that launched Nintendo into the stratosphere, Donkey Kong , originally started out as a game about Popeye climbing half-finished skyscrapers to save Olive Oil from a hulking, burly Bluto. But when Nintendo lost the Popeye rights, they had to create their own characters, which ended up giving us both Mario and Donkey Kong. It Gave Us the Word \"Wimp\" \nThe word \"wimp\", meaning weak, was taken from Popeye's greedy mooching friend J. Wellington Wimpy. Remember that you have Popeye to thank next time you're hasslin' a nerd. He Also Gave Us the Word \"Jeep\" \nThe automotive vehicle, then known as the Willy MB , was named after Popeye’s magical, dimension-hopping pet The Jeep. The idea was that, much like the Jeep, the Willy MB could go anywhere with ease. AND Popeye Popularized the Word \"Goon\" \nThe word \"goon\" existed before Popeye, but it wasn’t until the comic strip introduced the bizarre creature known as Alice the Goon that the word took off. Popeye Was the Father of the Superhero \nAs a strong muscleman who fought for the people years before Superman, Popeye is often credited for being the father of the superhero. And Jack Kirby — creator of Fantastic Four, Thor, The Hulk and countless other franchises for Marvel — cribbed Popeye’s insane brawling style for his superhero comics. What’s more, the cartoon above is an example of Kirby himself working on the Popeye animated series as an inbetweener — the guys who drew the frames in between the important frames. \nSo what do you think? Popeye’s not just for nerds now, eh? Now he’s the guy who invented the word wimp!
