Just explaining to him ‘it’s way too hard for me down here’ and he just told me to keep sticking it out.” \nTaylor was no stranger to tough times in his teens. \nHe suffered three serious shoulder injuries that needed reconstructing but his decision to move away from his family was the biggest test of his life. \nIn the end, a simple heart to heart saved Taylor’s career. \n“I spent that weekend away with my family and me and Dad did sit down and had a chat about things and where I could be and where I could have been,” Taylor said. \n“I could’ve been back home just working, being a normal guy. It did get better and (I’m) grateful to still be here. Ash Taylor during Titans training. Source: News Corp Australia \n“I wouldn’t be here, where I am today without my dad and my mum. I just really wanted to give back to him. He helped me along the way so now it’s just about giving back to them.” \nWithout that conversation, Taylor could’ve been playing park footy in 2017. Instead he kicked off the year playing alongside his idol — Johnathan Thurston — in the annual NRL All Stars match. \n“Getting to partner up with him (Thurston) is just incredible,” Taylor said. \n“He’s a great player and a great bloke off the field as well.” \nIt was a career highlight that signified how far Taylor had come. \nSix years earlier, he played for the Queensland Murri under-16s side in the curtain-raiser to the All Stars match. \nThe Gold Coast halfback now uses that story to inspire others. \n“That only felt like it was only a couple of years ago,” he said. \n“I love to tell that story when I go back to schools and back to rugby league clinics that NRL’s not too far away for them.” Hayne reaches out to Roosters 2:28 \nTaylor still can’t believe he spent a week rooming with the rugby league’s only four-time Dally M medallist and future Immortal. \nHe learnt bucketloads during the week-long camp in Newcastle and is primed for a bumper season alongside Kane Elgey on the Gold Coast. \n“He’s dynamic. He’s quick and he can read the game quick,” Taylor said of Elgey. \n“We’ve only got 40-odd games together, combined in the NRL, so we’re going to have to keep learning and keep getting better as we go along. \n“We’ve just got to make sure we’re competing — listening to the coach, listening to the players around us, getting feedback. That’s the biggest thing I’ve learnt at training.” Ash Taylor at a recovery session. Source: News Corp Australia \nTaylor is contracted with the Titans until the end of 2018 and has dispelled rumours he’ll return to Red Hill in two years. \nThe 2017 Emerging Maroons squad member wants to be part of a bright future on the glitter strip. \n“Neil (Henry) touched on that. We are young halves and we do want to build the team around us. \n“As long as me and Kane are playing well I’m sure he can build a team around us.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
