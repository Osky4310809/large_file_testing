But yesterday, Milo Ventimiglia thought people would be calling out of work due to the emotional despair that plagued them this morning. He’s not necessarily wrong — after all, some pretty upsetting things ended up happening.\nThere are spoilers ahead, so a fair warning — you’ll want to catch up before reading any further. Last night’s episode, titled “Memphis,” focused primarily on Randall and his relationship with his father , William, whose health has been deteriorating since the start of the season.\nAs you know, Randall was just recently able to reconnect with his dad — as a member of the “Big Three,” he was raised by Kate and Jack with no knowledge of his birth parents.\nNBC While we knew this moment was coming, it finally happened. During a road trip together, in which Randall learned a lot about William’s life as a young man, William passed away.\nAnd, well — Milo Ventimiglia wanted the fans to know that he, too, was upset over the outcome of the episode.\nJust in case you need a note after tonight's episode of #ThisIsUs . #PapaPearsonLovesYou .
