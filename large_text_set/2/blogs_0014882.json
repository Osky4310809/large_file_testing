He noted that Trump’s a grandfather to Jewish children through is son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

There are people committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to….” \nTrump interjected, “OK, sit down, I understand the rest of your question.”   \nHe later told Turx to be quiet, when the reporter perceived he misunderstood the question. \nTurn told Fox News host Ed Henry he realized he had hit a sore spot with Trump.

I’m with him when it comes to being outraged about him being charged with this anti-Semitism.” \n“I’m the least anti-Semitic person you have ever seen in your entire life,” Trump said in response to what he perceived to be Turx’s question. “Let me tell you something, I hate the charge. I find it repulsive.” \nTurx tweeted after the news conference: President Trump clearly misunderstood my question. This is highly regretful and I'm going to seek clarification. #TrumpNewsConference \n— Jake Turx (@JakeTurx) February 16, 2017 \nWhen the issue of anti-Semitism came up at during a joint press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, the Israeli prime minister came strongly to Trump’s defense. \n“I’ve known President Trump for many years … and there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump. I think we should put that to rest,” Netanyahu said.
