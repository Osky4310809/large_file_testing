Now, Bob Iger has let slip a few Han Solo movie story details! During an event at USC , the Disney CEO confirmed that the film will span a seven year stretch, covering Han’s life from 18 to 24. It will showcase how he came into possession of the Millennium Falcon and how he first met Chewbacca. \nRELATED: The Future of Star Wars: Disney Makes Post-Saga Plans \n“You’ll also discover how he got his name,” Iger revealed (via Variety ). \nDoes that mean that Han Solo’s name isn’t actually Han Solo?
