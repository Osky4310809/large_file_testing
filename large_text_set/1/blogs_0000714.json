It was not immediately known if the man had been charged with any crime. \nThis woman was lucky she wasn’t seriously injured in this attack, because it seemed like the man had every intention of hurting her, as male Muslim refugees have been known to do with women at their mercy. \nThe fact that this refugee used personal problems as an excuse for attacking the woman does not make it OK.
