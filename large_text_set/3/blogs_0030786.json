The opera’s title character, a beautiful princess in ancient China, turns romance into a life-or-death scenario. Any man who wants to marry her must solve three challenging riddles on pain of death — a test that no one survives until Prince Calaf comes along. \nAs strong as Turandot is, her story is more about fate more than individual agency; ultimately, she is conquered by Calaf’s love. \nYet in Pittsburgh Opera’s production of “Turandot,” which opened Saturday at the Benedum Center, Turandot has a bit more say in the matter. Soprano Alexandra Loutsion recently told the Post-Gazette that she wanted to explore Turandot’s softer side: what makes the ice queen so appealing to her suitors. In her debut in this fiendish role, she made a compelling case for that approach, depicting this character as someone who is vulnerable to her circumstances yet in control of her destiny. \nMs. Loutsion, a Canonsburg native and former Pittsburgh Opera resident artist, had a commanding presence, her voice soaring above the chorus in the second act. But she did not use that size for its own sake, bringing the same energy to softer phrases as she did to Turandot’s scorching riddles. By exposing Turandot’s sympathetic and assertive qualities, she deepened her portrayal of the character: It is Turandot who kisses Calaf in the final act, taking matters of the heart into her own hands. \nThis exploration of Turandot’s gentler side did not always work, and some moments felt too obvious or easy; Turandot’s sobs after Liu committed suicide comes to mind. And at times, my ear was seeking a bit more edge from the role. Overall, however, this was a triumphant role debut for Ms. Loutsion. \nThe other star of the show was the production itself, the most visually impressive staging that Pittsburgh Opera has offered since “Aida” in 2013. It’s no surprise Pittsburgh Opera, which last presented “Turandot” in 2011, brought back this production, originally directed and choreographed by Renaud Doucet and staged this time by Kathleen Stakenas and choreographer Roxanne Foster. \nDressed in elaborate robes, the chorus and supernumeraries carried various scepters and props; the Three Stooges-esque Ping, Pang and Pong (Craig Verm, Julius Ahn and Joseph Hu) contributed confusion and fine singing during their appearances; dancers twirled on the circular set, centered on the moon-like orb in the back of the stage. The lighting, designed by Guy Simard, especially added to the sense of grandeur. \nWhile Ms. Loutsion’s voice certainly matched this spectacle, the rest of the cast was uneven. With his high cheekbones, long black hair and heroic demeanor, debuting tenor Thiago Arancam cut a handsome Calaf, yet his pleasant voice was too small for the Benedum. The beloved “Nessun Dorma” had the hopeful quality of a boy tossing pebbles at the window of his crush. That approach had a certain charm to it — Calaf’s confidence in his ability to win over Turandot is a sort of romantic Napoleon complex — but Mr. Arancam’s sound was outmatched by Ms. Loutsion’s throughout. \nBass Wei Wu was impressive as Calaf’s father Timur, featuring a clear and muscular tone (not to mention a fantastic costume and wig). Maria Luigia Borsi captured the sweet loyalty of Liu, but her pitch was wobbly, her sound strained and her use of vibrato inconsistent. \nOutside of the occasional untethering among singers, chorus and orchestra, and early timidity from the instrumental and choral ensembles, music director Antony Walker effectively commanded the opera’s huge musical forces. The conductor’s pacing always kept an eye toward Puccini’s next musical peak. \nAs it did in 2011, Pittsburgh Opera used the original gongs from the 1926 premiere of “Turandot,” which added another special element to this production. \nPerformances continue through April 2. \nElizabeth Bloom: , 412-263-1750 and Twitter: @BloomPG . \nFirst Published March 26, 2017 11:20 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:28:11.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
