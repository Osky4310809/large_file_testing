We’re not complainers, which is why I think people put that ‘Angry Black Woman’ tag on us.”\nOrji recalls similar obstacles at the beginning of her career.\n“I remember when I was starting out at comedy clubs, and without fail a male comic—or just a man in general—would say, ‘Oh, so what’re you doing tonight? Are you doing spoken word? You singing?'” To which Orji would reply, “At the comedy club? ‘Comedy’ being the operative word, sir. Why are you asking me these things?”\nAlso appearing in All Jokes Aside: Black Women In Comedy are Michelle Buteau, Marie Faustine, Tiffany Haddish , Luenell, April Reign, Amanda Seales, Sasha Stewart, Sydnee Washington and Debra Wilson. Together they speak on the the ups and downs of practicing their craft.\nFollowing the documentary’s release, VH1 held a live panel discussing diversity and black women in entertainment with host Franchesca Ramsey and guests Buteau, Ellen Cleghorne, Azie Dungey and Naomi Ekpergin.\nWatch all of the great moments from the panel here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:14:10.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
