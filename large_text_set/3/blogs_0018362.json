It has a lot of effect,” he said, later adding that “What Trump is doing is wielding a two-by-four.” \nAfter an intemperate Trump tweet, “An epidemic of constitutional chin tugging and civil libertarian hair pulling immediately breaks out.

Congress is where the fate of the Trump presidency will be decided,” Krauthammer added then. But earlier this week, Krauthammer noted that Trump took his unique style right into the halls of Congress when he confronted Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., during a meeting with House Republicans.
