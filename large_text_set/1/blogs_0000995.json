Mansour, 63, was charged with murder, felonious assault and domestic violence after he reportedly shot his daughter, Tahani Mansour, twice in the head while she was sleeping in her bed.\nJamal’s son called 911 after his sister was shot, telling authorities that his father had shot Tahani.\nHowever, Jamal’s family says his diabetes was to blame, reports WXIX via Gateway Pundit.\n“We don't have a solid motive other than an argument occurred between a father and his daughter,” said Lt. George Lichman with Rocky River Police.\nBut when the father appeared in Rocky River Municipal Court on Sept. 29, the judge wasn’t buying his excuse, according to WJW. The judge said Jamal had “assassinated his daughter” and feared he would hurt more family members or flee the country.\nHis $1.3 million bond was altered to $4.5 million after the prosecutor requested a higher bond for Jamal.  \nJamal is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Jordan. He and his Brother own grocery stories and gas stations throughout the area.\nTahani was the youngest of six children, went to Cleveland State for college before going to Northeast Ohio Medical University for a pharmacy doctorate and lived with her parents.\n“We had the fire department respond and do an evaluation, it turns out (the father) was not under any medical care at the time of the incident and since he's been in our jail,” Lichman said.\nNeighbors say the family was quiet and kept to themselves. The family had lived in the area for a number of years.\n\"I understand that they have children. I have never seen the children. I would not recognize them. I've seen the father cutting the grass and occasionally the mother puttering with flowers, but I have never seen the children,\" said Horvath.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T01:02:23.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
