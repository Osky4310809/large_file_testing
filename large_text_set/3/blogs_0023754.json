However, ODI captain Mashrafe Mortaza conceded that the hosts are a better ODI outfit than in Test cricket. \nSri Lanka's ODI form isn't great though as they suffered a 5-0 whitewash at the hands of South Africa in their last series, but Mortaza said that the hosts will be tough opponents, especially at home. \n\"I think Sri Lanka have a more matured squad in the ODIs than the Tests. It is not going to be easy for us. A small innings can change things in the ODIs and T20s. We have to try to execute our plans to the full, or we just have to fight till the end,\" Mortaza told journalists on the eve of the opening ODI in Dambulla. \nMortaza wasn't part of the Test team that created history in Colombo, but was glad that most of the players who featured in the Test series will be playing the ODIs. \n\"If you look at our ODI squad, most of them are playing in Tests as well. It will help them perform in ODIs. But in the last three months, we have played five Tests and not ODIs. It is a totally different ball-game now. We have to be very careful in the first match and stick to our plans,\" Mortaza said. \n\"I think our batters are in good form, but all three departments have to come to the party in ODIs. Shakib recently has got a hundred so we are looking for something similar from him, and the others,\" Mortaza added. \nOff-spinner Mehedi Hasan wasn't picked in the ODI squad and returned home with the Test specialists. But he was called back to Colombo immediately to give the attack a bit of variation. \"Mehedi has joined the squad and we have some variation. We will try to balance the side leading into the first game,\" Mortaza said. \nBangladesh have a decent record in ODI cricket at home, but their form away from home is not so great. Mortaza stressed the need to improve their game away from home. \n\"We have done well at home. Our challenge started in New Zealand to do well away from home. We couldn't do it there, despite creating a lot of chances. In the second and third ODIs, we gave away good starts. We have to hold on to good starts here, with bat and ball as home teams have extra advantage.\" © Cricbuzz TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T18:49:43.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
