The report, which was signed by one Folasade Bello on behalf of the Director-General of the DSS, was in response to a letter sent to the DSS by the AGF dated December 19, 2016 with reference number, HAGF/DSS/2016/Vol 1/7. The DSS also attached 12 documents as evidence against Magu who was rejected by the Senate last week based on the damning security report. According to the DSS, Magu while serving on the presidential arms procurement probe panel befriended a fellow member of the panel, Air Commodore Mohammed Umar (retd.). Umar was later arrested and charged by the DSS sometimes last year for alleged money laundering and illegal possession of firearms. According to the DSS, Umar said in his confessional statement that his company furnished Magu’s official residence in upscale Maitama. It reads in part, “This is a copy of the confessional statement of the confessional statement of Air Commodore Mohammed Umar (retd.), a suspect hitherto detained and currently being prosecuted by the service. “The statement confirms his ownership of Valcour SA Nigeria Limited, a company awarded the contract of securing and furnishing an official residence for Ibrahim Magu by the FCTA. Investigations revealed that this was facilitated after Magu was earlier shown the residence by one Uche Aleka, a close business associate of Umar who was introduced to Magu by the former.” The security service said when Umar’s house was searched by operatives, several top secret documents, which emanated from the EFCC were found at his residence, evidence that Magu was providing him with sensitive information. It added, “This is a copy of progress report with reference number SH/COS/24/A/7277 dated 25th May, 2016 on NNPC/NLG Brass Investments Accounts in Nigeria commercial banks from Chief of Staff to the President, Mr. Abba Kyari, to the acting Chairman of the EFCC chairman. The letter is an official/classified document of the EFCC, which was duly received by the commission as indicated by the stamp on the document. However, it was recovered at Umar’s residence.” The DSS alleged that Magu allegedly used his position to settle personal scores with his perceived opponents. It concludes, “It has exposed Magu as a fraudulent officer and betrays the high confidence reposed in him by the President.” All attempts to speak with the EFCC spokesman, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, proved abortive as his telephone indicated that it was switched off. In his response to the AGF last year, however, the EFCC boss denied all the allegations levelled against him by the DSS. Magu his relationship with Umar was one of “professional acquaintance devoid of issues of conflict of interest” since their paths crossed when they became members of the arms procurement probe panel. He said, “The claim that EFCC documents, including EFCC letters addressed to the Vice President and being investigation reports on the activities of Emmanuel Kachikwu and his brother Dumebi Kachikwu, were found in his home during a search by the DSS came to me as a surprise. “If that is correct, he should be made to disclose how he came by such documents. I never discussed my official duties with him let alone give him documents pertaining to investigations being conducted by the commission.” Magu further denied allegations that Umar rented the Maitama apartment for him.
