They give them a suspicious-looking piece of cheese with a label that we've never seen before,\" she said. \nIn between images of cartoon characters, the packet of the snacks provided by the ministry as part of a project launched to enhance the students' nutrition, carries the logo of the military-owned Al-Nasr for Services and Maintenance (Queen Service) and the phrase \"long live Egypt,\" which was popularized by President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and became a trademark for the military and the former defense minister turned president. \nOfficials at the Education Ministry told local media outlets prior to the start of the current academic year that the ministry had contracted the military's production arm, the National Services Projects Organization (NSPO), to provide the meals. \nThe entity, which encompasses companies producing goods that range from bottled water to construction material, is part of the military's growing economic empire, which has expanded since the election of al-Sisi in 2014. \nThe Education Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that it has formed a committee to test the meals and reveal the cause of the students' illness.
