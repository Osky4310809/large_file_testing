There's been a lot of discussion as to whether there would be a sequel and, if so, what form it might take. \nBut despite having nearly-identical Rotten Tomatoes ratings (26% for Green Lantern and 28% for Warcraft ), Jones thought he had some constructive criticism for the future of the space-cop franchise. — Duncan Jones (@ManMadeMoon) January 13, 2017 \nThe limit on the rings power should not be about battery life, but the need to be original every time you use it. — Duncan Jones (@ManMadeMoon) January 13, 2017 \nMechanics & stakes of Green Lantern always bugged me. Ring that can do anything & you have a tough time winning fights? Hero, please! — Duncan Jones (@ManMadeMoon) January 13, 2017 \nThe hook in the \"dumb jock\" version of Green Lantern is that he has the power, but lacks the wits to use it. Endearingly frustrating. — Duncan Jones (@ManMadeMoon) January 13, 2017 \nAnyway, Im not doing Green Lantern. I think he's dumb. :) Hope someone proves me wrong. — Duncan Jones (@ManMadeMoon) January 13, 2017 \nIt's arguably worth noting that Jones's biggest problem with Green Lantern -- that his ring can make \"anything,\" and yet he uses it for fists and laser blasts -- is a frequent criticism of Hal Jordan, and one that was largely addressed in the form of Kyle Rayner, the Green Lantern who took over for a while in the 1990s. Rayner was an artist in his day job and often created elaborate monsters, Rube Goldberg devices, and more. Elements of that personality were brought into Hal's \"race car track\" in the 2011 movie. \nAdditionally, while he has some solid points, hardcore fans will note that in the comments of his tweets, Jones suggests some uses for the Lantern ring that indicate he's either just being glib for the sake of argument, or he doesn't understand the way the ring works in-universe.
