ADVERTISEMENT \nAteneo was on an eight-game winning streak prior to its game against NU, but the Lady Bulldogs were there to spoil the party as they handed the Lady Eagles their second loss in 11 outings. \nMeneses added that it wasn’t just the UAAP schedule that was chipping away at the team, it was also the school’s midterms which were scheduled around this time. \n“The exam week is a factor, and you all know how hectic exams are, it’s their hell week,” said Meneses. “It’s exhausting for them, some even skip sleep.” \nBut Meneses said the Lady Eagles’ morale is still high despite having their eight-game winning streak snapped. \n“The morale’s still there, as we said earlier in the locker room even though we lost we still have a reward because we’ll practice just once tomorrow instead of having one in the morning and one in the afternoon,” said Meneses. \n“The kids are still happy, they’re just tired.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T10:24:19.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
