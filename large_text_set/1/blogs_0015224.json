The voters knew all along that you had it in you. That’s why you lost. \nAt a time when the lack of results from Congress has led to the legislative branch being held in contempt by most Americans, nothing could display self-centered arrogance more than the assumption that your do-nothing presence or notice-me absence from Friday’s inauguration has some meaning. Advertisement - story continues below \n— The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) January 17, 2017 \nGet over yourselves. \nThis divided nation ought to be coming together to make the painful but essential transition from politics to government. That’s the American way. The American tradition. But you don’t understand that, do you? Your refusal to support America’s next president because you lost the election reveals that you have no interest in serving the people of a nation that deserves better from you. Advertisement - story continues below \nThat’s not really a surprise, but it’s nice that instead of Republicans having to make the point, you made it yourselves. I can’t thank you enough for your foot-stamping absurdity, because more than any words from any other political figure, your lingering, collective pout over the fact that Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton shows clearly the limits of your narrow vision. \nSpare us the pretext of the Russians, or the Martians, or the this or the that. Spare us the social justice race warrior innuendo. Donald Trump is going to be America’s next president because the warmed-over hash of 1960s knee-jerk buzzwords has finally acquired that greenish tinge of all things left around when their time for disposal has passed. \nPitiful. Doubly pitiful for black legislators who seem to think it is 1956 all over again because the incoming president refuses to kowtow to the black establishment any more than he does the white one. \nYou are a politically irrelevant fringe. For years, for decades, voters have sent you to Washington in hopes that you would do something. What have you given them back? Nothing more than the Democratic philosophy of more handouts, more abortions and less responsibility, which has turned neighborhoods that were once poor but proud into gang-ravaged war zones.

Then again, he believed in something. You believe in nothing more than the politics of pointless gestures so that you can fool the folks back home into thinking you matter. \nYou don’t. The last time we had a significant number of lawmakers boycott a republican presidential inauguration was in 1861… same old democrats. pic.twitter.com/yP8cw5PIBw \n— Dissident Patriot ن (@disspat) January 18, 2017 \nSo take Friday off. Don’t bother attending a ceremony for a society you no longer understand and a nation that has moved beyond your crude polarizing characterizations of non-liberal whites as Klansmen. \nLet me suggest one variation to your plan. The usual routine, of course, is that on Friday you will develop principles as you whine and moan about racism and Russians and then next week return to the House floor where your endless round of wheedling and deal-making will begin all over. \nNo. \nIf seeing a man who won the election fair and square take the oath of office is just too much democracy for your tender feelings to bear, if working for all the people of America and not just the niche groups that own you is too much to stomach, please take your toys and your obstructionist self-pity and just go home. \nAnd don’t come back. \nMy president doesn’t need you. My country doesn’t need you. \nAmerica has work to do. \nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.
