'Top-of-his-class' guy \nKuchibhotla was a software engineer at Rockwell Collins, an avionics and information technology company, Rod Larson, his line manager, told the newspaper. \n\"He was very sharp, a top-of-his-class kind of guy,\" Larson said. \n\"His personality was exceptional. He was the kind of employee every manager would want. I couldn't say anything slightly bad about Srinivas.\" \nSushma Swaraj, India's foreign minister, said on Twitter \"I am shocked\", adding that she would help the family to bring Kuchibhotla's body back to Hyderabad. \nVikas Swarup, spokesperson for India's foreign ministry, said Kuchibhotla was from Telangana state. . @USAndIndia strongly condemns the tragic shooting of two Indians and one American in Kansas.Our deepest sympathies. https://t.co/wGjUv35iIJ â€” MaryKay Loss Carlson (@USAmbIndia) February 24, 2017 \nGrillot said in an interview from his hospital bed that when the shooting broke out, he hid until nine shots had been fired and he thought the suspect's gun magazine was empty. \n\"I got up and proceeded to chase him down, try to subdue him,\" Grillot said in a video posted on the Kansas City Star's website. \"I got behind him and he turned around and fired a round at me.\" \nGrillot said the bullet went through his hand and into his chest, just missing a major artery. \n\"It's not about where he [the victim] was from or his ethnicity,\" Grillot said. \"We're all humans, so I just did what was right to do.\" \nUS Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas posted a statement on Facebook about the shooting, expressing concern for the safety of other immigrants. \n\"I strongly condemn violence of any kind, especially if it is motivated by prejudice and xenophobia,\" Moran said.
