(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washigton Post) 6:05 p.m. update: Prince William County Public Schools have already decided to close. Follow this link for any additional announcements of closings and delays: School closures and delays in the D.C. area for March 14\nOriginal post from 5:15 p.m.\nMany students and teachers in the Washington region haven’t had a snow day this entire winter. On Tuesday, many of them finally are likely to get their well-deserved and long-awaited day off.\nA major and messy winter storm will probably create slick travel conditions in many parts of the region Tuesday morning. And the snow and sleet, combined with gusty winds, may be arriving during the morning commute.\n[ Major and messy winter storm bears down on Washington: What to expect and answers to frequent questions ]\nBut federal workers: We’re not convinced conditions will be bad enough for a shut down and we think you may stay open for business — although perhaps you’ll be delayed.\nSchoolCast\nThe schools most likely to close are those west of Interstate 95, where the most snow and coldest temperatures are expected — which will lead to slick road conditions.\nThe weather in the District and east of Interstate 95 may even be messy enough for some schools to pack it in, but it’s more uncertain. Some school systems may opt to delay instead.\nHistorically, D.C. public schools will stay open unless conditions are seriously hazardous, so the city’s likelihood of delay and closing is lower than adjacent school systems.\nSchools in St. Mary’s County, where mostly rain is expected, may open on time.\nBecause schools haven’t used up snow days to this point this winter, we think they’re more likely to err on the side of caution and these likelihoods take that into account.\nFedCast\nWe don’t think this storm will be severe enough to shut down the federal government. But because conditions may be slick early in the morning and snow may coincide with the morning commute, we could easily see a delayed opening.\nAlso, we are fairly confident that federal workers will be granted an unscheduled leave or telework option.\nThe Capital Weather Gang's Jason Samenow breaks down the expectations for the winter storm barreling toward the D.C. area on March 13 and 14.
