The National Autonomous University of Mexico, known as UNAM, says the Carlos Slim Foundation and the National Human Rights Commission signed the agreement Tuesday. UNAM will train 50 instructors who will give 10 workshops at its satellite facilities in San Antonio, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and Tucson, Arizona. The Slim foundation will publicize the effort through its Acceso Latino web platform. The workshops will focus on an estimated 2 million to 3 million Mexican migrants who might be eligible for U.S. citizenship but haven't completed the process. Migrants will also be taught how to defend their rights. Reblog", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T02:36:49.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
