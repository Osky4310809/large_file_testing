Always keen to put her own edgy twist on a demure, ultra-feminine look, Dunst pair her dress with loose waves, a bold red lip, and layered diamond necklaces, adding a bit of spice to an otherwise ethereal ensemble.\nDavid Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images So romantic! \nThe bustier dress has been cropping up on red carpets for months now, and we’re more than on board with the trend. Stars like Dunst are proving that a modern take on this Victorian garment (slash short-lived 2000s trend ) can be fashionable — and far less painful to wear than in centuries past!\nAt the SAG Awards, actress Natalia Dyer — who plays Nancy Wheeler on Stranger Things — also worked the red carpet in a bustier dress by Miu Miu .\nJeff Kravitz/FilmMagic Slay , queen! \n\nEarlier this month, Kristen Bell worked a bustier jumpsuit at the People’s Choice Awards, pairing her ensemble with beachy waves much like Dunst’s.\nAllen Berezovsky/Getty Images for Fashion Media And in November last year, at the 2016 Angel Ball honoring her late father Robert Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian wore a statement-making bustier frock with oval cutouts on the thighs.\nJohn Lamparski/WireImage Talk about trend-setting!\nWhile bustiers, which feature cups that push the breasts up and together, might not be comfortable for everyone, we’re liking the remixed versions of this look that we’ve seen in Hollywood recently.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:09:47.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
