( CMG ) announced on December 12 that Monty Moran would step down from his board seat and role as co-CEO, effective immediately. His departure leaves founder and chairman Steve Ells as the company's sole CEO once again; he had shared the top job with Moran since 2009. \nElls has his work cut out for him. Chipotle just barely logged a year-over-year revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2016, after straight four quarters of decline. Same-store sales continued to fall, and the stock remains mired at 2013 levels. \nElls himself panned the company's turnaround effort on December 6, telling a Barclays investment conference that he's \"not satisfied with the rate of recovery,\" in particular \"the quality of the restaurant experience.\" He pinned longer lines – which many observers have taken as a sign of improving health – on worsening service. Faced with declining sales and expensive promotions, the company cannot afford to hire or even hold onto the best workers; meanwhile the job's difficulty has risen due to a host of new food safety protocols. Surveying this landscape, Ells admitted he was \"nervous\" about the company's 2017 earnings guidance of $10.00 per share, released in October. The stock, predictably, swooned. \nThere's still some hope: Ells told the conference that, beginning in July, the company was gaining more customers than it lost. The Rise of Chipotle's Stock \nEleven years ago, such troubles were unthinkable. Investors couldn't get enough of Chipotle from the moment shares hit the market on January 26, 2006. The stock opened at $45.00, more than double its initial public offering (IPO) price of $22.00 – itself boosted from an initial range of $15.50 to $17.50 – and closed up exactly 100%, at $44.00. \nThe press gushed. The debut was \"spicier than a three-alarm hot sauce,\" Dow Jones Newswires wrote the following day. Citing another item the chain does not sell, USA Today called the stock \"a hot tamale.\" MarketWatch ticked off an impressive list of bests-since. \nStill owned by McDonald's Corp. ( MCD ) at the time, the 13-year-old burrito chain was a rising star at the confluence of two major trends: the \"fast-casual\" approach to dining that has reshaped the restaurant industry and the real-food push that has shunned industrialized farming and over-packaged, over-processed edible plastics. What's better, unlike so many hot IPOs before and after it, Chipotle kept investors hooked using the same approach that kept customers lining up: a simple, quality offering. \nTo customers it served up a straightforward set of options and the perception that they were eating something honest and reasonably healthy. In the early days, when there was no menu, customers would come in, get confused and turn to walk out. Founder and CEO Steve Ells \"would chase them down and say, 'No, no, no, I'll buy you a burrito. Just try it,'\" COO Gretchen Selfridge told Bloomberg last year. As Ells put it, \"Better than a menu board, look at the food.\" People tried it, and they came back. They brought their friends. (See also, Steve Ells Biography . ) \nInvestors got a refreshing back-to-basics experience with Chipotle, as well. It sold a product within just about everyone's \"circle of competence,\" and from the time Ells opened his first location, it sold vastly higher quantities of it than anyone expected. To break even, the first store needed to sell 107 (or 114, accounts vary) burritos per day. Within a month of opening Ells was pushing over 1,000 out the door every day. Co-CEO Monty Moran told Bloomberg, \"No one ever looked at the business plan again.\" \nRevenues exploded. Chipotle sold $187.0 million in its first quarter as public company. A year later that figure was up 26%, followed by 29% the next year and 16% the year after that – not bad for the calamity-filled year to March 2009. By the third quarter of 2015 revenues had reached $1.2 billion, an increase of 639% over ten years. \nProfits followed suit: $8.0 million in the first quarter of 2006 rose 55% to $12.4 million a year later, rose 40% to $17.3 million a year after that. Chipotle reported net income of $144.9 million for the quarter ending September 2015, a leap of 2,741% over a decade. \nNot that investors wanted any of those profits back. Chipotle has never paid a dividend , focusing instead on relentless expansion. Every 10-K the company put out boasted a list of new states with a smattering of new countries – Canada, Britain, France, Germany – and a reliably triple-digit annual increase in total restaurants. \nChipotle was doing what its corporate parent (from 1998 to 2005) had done in prior generations, printing cash by selling fast, cheap, tasty food to anyone and everyone. But it was doing it better than McDonald's. Its food was fresher, the line went: healthier, more ethical, better for the environment. It tasted better. Who could resist the burritos or the shares? Chipotle was taking over. \nStates with Chipotle locations at year-end, 2005-2015 \nSource: company filings. \nFor a while the only problem was the valuation . As shares surged, even rapidly rising sales and profits couldn't keep up. An April 2012 Motley Fool article noted that the company traded for over 60 times its trailing twelve month earnings , but called the \"lofty\" valuation \"rather justified\" in light of profit growth that far outstripped that of rivals such as Panera Bread Co. ( PNRA ) and Qdoba owner Jack in the Box Inc. ( JACK ). \nChipotle's shares hit an all-time high of $758.61 on August 5, 2015. The hypothetical oracular investor who had bought at the stock's IPO opening price and sold at that level would have made a 1,586% profit. The Fall of Chipotle's Stock \nThen five people caught E. coli from a Chipotle in Seattle. No one noticed. Next came a norovirus outbreak in Simi Valley, California, which sickened dozens in mid-August. Early in September, that outbreak was traced back to Chipotle, as was a salmonella outbreak in Minnesota. In late October cases of E. coli began to crop up in Washington and Oregon, prompting the closure of 43 locations in those states as health officials investigated. The CDC reported additional cases of E. coli in California, Minnesota, Ohio and New York later that month, followed by Illinois, Pennsylvania and Maryland in December. A norovirus outbreak at Boston College followed soon after, with over 100 students affected. \nThe CDC continued to investigate the chain's multiple E. coli outbreaks, with Oklahoma, Kansas and North Dakota joining the ranks of affected states. On January 6 the company revealed that it had received a grand jury subpoena related to the Simi Valley outbreak. Management began damage control, hosting a Q&A at a conference in Florida that lifted shares for a couple of sessions. The CDC declared an end to the E. coli outbreaks on February 1, the day before the company reported fourth-quarter results.
