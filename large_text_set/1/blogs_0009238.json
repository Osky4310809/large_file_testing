I’m sad because I like him, I’m sad because he could be an option for us in the long season. \n“I’m happy because this is what he wants, he wants to play, he wants to play every game, he wants to be an important player in the team. \n“So if this is what he wants, I’m happy for a very good professional.\" Mourinho has mixed emotions over Schneiderlin's departure (Photo: Tom Purslow) \nSchneiderlin had seen first-team opportunities short on the ground under Mourinho this term, featuring in the Premier League for just 11 minutes. \nThe 27-year-old knew he is down the pecking order and has been keen to reunite with his former Southampton boss Ronald Koeman at Goodison Park. \nWest Brom were also interested in the Frenchman, and had prepared to make him the club's highest-paid player. \nBut they were unable to agree a fee with United, seeing an £18million offer turned down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:25:20.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
