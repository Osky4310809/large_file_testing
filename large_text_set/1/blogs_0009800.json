He makes it look so easy with defenders on him, I’m not sure he’d even be effective in a dunk contest at this point. Let me be clear, though, Giannis: If you want to enter the dunk contest, please do, because this is fantastic.\nWatch Rodney McGruder try to defend Antetokounmpo on the break. He honestly does his best and makes Giannis pick the ball up outside of the paint. He even contested the dunk in a way that what would normally have been successful, but this is The Greek Freak and there is nothing you can do to stop him.\nHe. Dunked. This.
