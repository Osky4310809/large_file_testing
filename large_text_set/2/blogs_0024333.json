Now, the Costume Designers Guild obviously only cares about one specific aspect of a film and The Wrap points out that the winner of the contemporary category has never gone on to win the costume design Oscar, but this could be the start of a new trend where the Costume Designers awards are somehow able to predict the Best Picture winners.
