Lately, however, they are not on the same page about a particular matter. \nIf reports are to be believed, Abhi and Ash have conflicting opinions about their daughter, Araadhya Bachchan ‘s entry in Bollywood. While Abhishek reportedly wants his daughter to start doing films early and hone her acting skills, mommy dearest begs to differ as she does not want her to enter the industry at such a tender age. The contrasting take on this matter has led to a rift between the parents. \nIt’s a cute reason to argue, if you ask me!
