By Tyler Pecyna / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nThe best way to commemorate Sidney Crosby’s 1,000th career point ? Consume lots of meat, fries and slaw. \nAt least that’s how Primanti Bros. sees it. \nThe restaurant chain unveiled a sandwich called “The Captain” in honor of Crosby’s milestone. It features capicola —“the leader of the Primanti Bros. team”—“flanked by” turkey and roast beef. (No word on whether those cold cuts represent Crosby’s linemates, Chris Kunitz and Jake Guentzel.) The sandwich is topped with what Primantis is calling a “record-setting pile” of cheese, fries, coleslaw and tomato. [Read more: Ranking Crosby’s best career points ] \nThe sandwich was made available Thursday immediately after Crosby recorded his historic assist against Winnipeg, and — unlike Primantis’ previous Penguins-themed food — it seems like this one might be a menu staple. \nIt “will be around as long as Crosby keeps scoring,” the restaurant said in a news release. Crosby’s only 29 and likely isn’t going to stop putting points up for a few more years. At least, as long as he skirts injury, father time and things like record-setting piles of cheese, fries and coleslaw. \nTyler Pecyna: tpecyna@post-gazette.com and Twitter, @tyler_pecyna .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:55:41.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
