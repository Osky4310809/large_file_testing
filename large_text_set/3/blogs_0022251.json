It's not for nothing that we are seventh in the UEFA ranking. \n\"But I have no doubt that Jurgen Klopp can lead Liverpool to its old strength if he's allowed to work calmly.\" \nIn the summer, Liverpool made an approach for BVB's Christian Pulisic, while Klopp met Ousmane Dembele for talks about a move before he eventually opted to switch to Dortmund . \nAnd Watzke said clubs could forget about signing Dortmund's young stars, adding: \"Those who have tried soon realised it's a waste of time.\" \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
