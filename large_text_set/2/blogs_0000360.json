The \"sharks\" on the episode are: Mark Cuban, Daymond John, Kevin O'Leary, Lori Greiner, and Robert Herjavec. \n\"It was half MBA, half theater class, and 100 percent the big leagues!\" Delahanty said. Peaceful Fruits' founder Evan Delahanty on \"Shark Tank.\" Courtesy Disney/ABC Television Group \nDelahanty, a Peninsula native who graduated from Old Trail School in Bath, Walsh Jesuit High School in Cuyahoga Falls, and Cornell University, said acai berries can be sustainably harvested to provide a livelihood for the ethnic African people who live there, without harming the rainforest where they grow. \nSince launching Peaceful Fruits in 2014, he has sold more than $25,000 of snacks online and through local retailers such as Mustard Seed and Krieger's Market in Cuyahoga Falls . \nPeaceful Fruits is hosting a private invitation-only watch party and Q&A from 7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. at the Mustard Seed Market & Cafe , 867 W. Market St., in Akron. \nHe will appear in an episode themed \"America's Heroes\" that also features a firefighter and his wife's fireproof bags, a pediatric nurse who invented a vibrating mat to calm crying babies; and a former Army intelligence officer and his business partner from Portsmouth, Ohio, who created a healing ointment from essential oils. Peaceful Fruits fruit strips: \nFlavors: Wild Acai Apple or Pineapple \nEach 0.25-ounce strip has 30 to 35 calories, 1.5 grams of fat (0 grams trans fat), 60 mg of potassium, 5 grams of carbohydrates, and 3 grams of natural sugars. \nIngredients (pineapple): Organic acai, organic pineapple, organic pear. \nIngredients (apple): Organic acai, organic apple, organic pear, organic lemon juice. \nPrice: $1.25 each, or $15 for a 12-pack. \nRetailers: Hattie's Food Hub , 395 Douglas St.; Acme Fresh Market ; Krieger's Market ; Mustard Seed Market & Cafe; Nature's Bin , Vita Urbana Bistro & Urban Market . \n\"Walking into the Tank was an incredibly surreal experience,\" Delahanty said. \"It was like stepping into your TV and suddenly it was really happening!\" \n\"My strategy was to get the Sharks interested in the product itself, get them chewing (literally, making TV is hungry work!) and then hook them with my social good story,\" he said. \n\"On TV, the Tank is non-stop and high energy. In real life, it's the same thing times 10! These are five high-level, Type-A all-stars -- and they are used to getting answers. Talking over each other, coming at you from every angle, and asking followups or debating you while someone else is already asking the next one! \n\"There is editing for length, of course, but it's not 'TV magic' with multiple takes, etc. It's hectic and live and the Sharks are evaluating you every second - it's one of the highest pressure things I have ever done, and also one of the most fun!\" \nLegally prohibited from discussing the outcome before it airs, Delahanty said he, too, is looking forward to seeing the episode for the first time. \n\"I guess the world will see how good of a job I did on the 10th!\" Top Workplaces", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:57:59.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
