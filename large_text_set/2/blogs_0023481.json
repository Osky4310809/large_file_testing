The United States Air Force has plans to drop 100 bombs , some as large as 300 pounds each , in waters north of Kauai, Hawaii, which will surely disrupt the lives of hundreds of marine animals who call the Kauai waters home. If approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA-Fisheries), the tests would begin in September 2017 and continue all the way through August of 2022. The testing would involve the detonation of a variety of missiles and other weapons. There is no need to impact the health of innocent marine animals, just for some bomb testing! Satit Soithongcharoen /Free Images \nThe bomb testings could cause sound or pressure-related problems for not only whales but also dolphins and other marine mammals. Whitlow Au , the chief scientist of the Marine Mammal Research Program at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology at the University of Hawaii said, “We don’t even know the intensity of the sound that reaches an animal caused by a missile launch.” But the Air Force has stated that they will protect marine animals by looking for them on the surface of the water, which makes zero sense considering the ocean waters are more than 15,000 feet deep. \nThe negative impact of ocean noise on whales and dolphins has been well documented. Whale and dolphins rely on acoustics to navigate their way through the ocean. These mammals rely on sound for communication, mating, foraging, and migration . The addition of loud noises from ships, sonar, drilling rigs, and other human sources can distort messages sent by marine mammals. Scientists believe that acoustic noise pollution prevents these mammals from being able to detect approaching ships or fishing nets, adding to the risk of being killed . \nPlease sign this urgent petition asking the NOAA-Fisheries to block plans by the U.S. Air Force for these unnecessary bomb testings. And please share with your friends and family too. Marine animals are counting on us! \nLead Image Source: Satit Soithongcharoen /Shutterstock  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:42:54.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
