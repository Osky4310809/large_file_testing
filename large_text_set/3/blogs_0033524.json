Staff had previously noted that the boy had “certain difficulties” and was aggressive and rough. \nThe family have had extensive contact with social workers and received significant therapeutic services for the boy who has been diagnosed with autism. \nThe 39-year-old man, who was the main carer for the child and who cannot be identified to protect his son's identity, has undergone anger management therapy and psychological intervention. \nDefence counsel for the man said the boy remained in the care of his parents and that social services had concluded that the child was in a loving and supportive family environment. \nThe accused man, who has no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to one count of wilful assault of the child in June 2013 and two counts of assault in December 2014. \nJudge Martin Nolan said playschool staff were to be praised for how they dealt with the matter and said they had handled it in an “exemplary way” that was fair to everyone. \nHe said it seemed the man was “at the end of his tether” and did not know what to do with his child. \n“Most parents feel like that at certain times” said Judge Nolan, but noted it was not permissible to treat the child as the accused had. He imposed a one year sentence which he suspended in full on the basis the accused be of good behaviour. \nA local garda told the court that the boy's playgroup first reported concerns about the boy when he was two years old and they noted bruise marks on his neck. The child later attended with a bite mark to his cheek. The accused admitted biting the child to show him how sore it was. \nIn a later incident at playschool the accused man struck his son several times and swung him by his arm after being asked to collect him following a biting incident. \nDefence counsel, Tom Neville BL, said his client had been fully co-operative with investigation and expressed remorse. He handed in a psychological report which he said outlined his clients background in terms of how he had been raised and differing approaches to discipline. \nEvidence \nA local garda told Gerardine Small BL, prosecuting, that in early June 2013 the two year old child came to playgroup wearing a scarf and hat. When staff removed them they noticed bruising which looked like fingermarks on his neck. Photographs were taken and emailed to social services. \nThe accused man told staff that the child had said “the F word” and he went to hit him but missed and hit his neck. \nLater in June the mother of the child told staff as she dropped off her son that he had fallen off a toy tractor or car. Staff noticed bruising on his face, a circular mark to the back of his neck and what looked like a bite mark on his face. \nSocial services were alerted and a medical exam confirmed it was a non-accidental bite mark. \nThe accused said the bruising was from running into a pool table and falling off his trike. He said he would sometimes threaten the boy with his belt but did not always hit him. He said this was usually in relation to the boy's refusal to eat and his behaviour. \nThe accused later told gardai he had bitten the child because the child had bitten him and he wanted to show him how sore it was. \nIn December 2014, when the child was four-years-old, the accused was notified by playschool staff of a biting incident. The accused attended to collect him and when the child ran over to him he struck him twice. He grabbed his son by the arm and swung him. The child fell against a wall. \nStaff asked the father to sign an incident report but he refused and began shouting at a staff member. \nThe court heard social services were working with the family and the mother and the accused agreed not to discipline the child physically. The accused spoke to garda voluntarily. \nThe garda agreed with Mr Neville that it had been over two years since the last incident without any recurrence and social workers have been liaising with the parents and retraining them. \nHe agreed with Mr Neville said that, not withstanding the offending incidents, social services had concluded that the child was in a loving and supportive family environment.
