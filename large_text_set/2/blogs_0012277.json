And now we’re looking forward to it even more if possible, because a behind the scenes Beauty and the Beast video was just released and ohmygosh , we might need to lay down.\nNo, seriously, can somebody call the doctor, because our blood pressure is way too high to be normal, um. We not only get a few more glimpses of what the upcoming live action version looks like, but some clips of the original, which, heart eyes, AND interviews with the cast.\nHas Christmas come early? Is it our birthdays? Nothing this good happens without provocation , we just don’t BELIEVE it. Emma Watson totally fangirls over the movie which we TOTALLY RELATE TO, and we love hearing her and her costars talk about what a cool privilege it is to be able to bring something near and dear to them when they were younger to new life.\nOne of the things we’re most excited about is the updating of Belle’s character. We’ve already heard that Belle will be the inventor in this version, not her father, which is exciting. But director Bill Condon speaks in the video about adding complexity and nuance to Belle’s character, and we SO HERE FOR THAT.\nNot that we don’t love the original, but it’s super important to make sure Disney princesses are adapted to a modern context and given the agency and dynamic qualities that they perhaps weren’t afforded when the movies were originally made. “She is a character in an animated movie, so it is a question of taking these characters and putting them into this extra dimension, putting them into a live-action context, which means adding levels of psychology and nuance, and updating it.” Have we mentioned we’re excited? BECAUSE WE’RE EXCITED.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:04:02.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
