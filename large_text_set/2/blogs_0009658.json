Tubmanâ€™s photo is one of 44 photo cards of abolitionists and politicians collected by Emily Howland, a Quaker abolitionist. \nThe photo (left) is a particularly rare find because of how young Tubman was when it was taken. It dates back to just after the Civil War when she was in her early forties. (Tubman was born sometime between 1819 and 1823, but the exact date is unknown.) Many of the known photos of the abolitionist and suffragist show her later in life. The famous photo on the right was taken sometime in the 1870s when she was in her early fifties. \nThe photograph is going up for auction on March 30. \nAll images courtesy Swann Auction Galleries More from mental_floss...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:02:59.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
