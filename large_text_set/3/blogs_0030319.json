The single market is an idea that Britain originally pushed for—a trading area where the regulations are harmonised so that goods and services can be traded on an interchangeable basis. Without it, there is the danger that trade is restricted because, for example, Slovenia might impose rules on car design which mean that it effectively excludes vehicles made in other EU countries. But in order to make the single market work, there have to be common rules; and the imposition of those rules is something that British voters seemed to rebel against. A further confusion is between access and membership . Every country in the world, even North Korea, has access to the single market; it is membership that makes it easier for companies to sell their goods. Then there is a customs union. This simply means a free trade area where all members have common tariffs against goods from outside . Again, such a deal is efficient but prevents member countries from agreeing separate deals with other countries (as Britain wants to do). Then there is the European Economic Area (EEA) which is a peculiar type of free trade agreement, operated by just Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein . This gives some freedom to negotiate deals with countries outside the EU but requires accepting freedom of movement and budget contributions. Then, there is falling back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules; these would involve trading with the EU but with tariffs imposed on goods and with possible barriers to trade in services. Britain's red lines mean that being part of the EEA or the customs union would be impossible. And falling back on WTO membership would be economically damaging. So the hope seems to be, as Brexiteers have argued, that Britain could have a free trade agreement similar to those signed (just) with Canada or South Korea. But that is where the trickiest bit of the negotiations would occur because of the EU's red line; it does not want Britain to benefit from a cherry-picked deal that might encourage other countries to follow the path to the exit. A free trade agreement would avoid tariffs but still require agreement on rules of origin. These would require British manufacturers to show that more than 60% of the goods they export to the EU were made in their home country—tricky in a world of global value chains where cars, for example, use a lot of imported components. It might also involve a mutual recognition agreement, so that EU countries could accept that Britain's standards for testing and certification. Without such agreements, British goods could face barriers just as steep as those deriving from tariffs. But here is the rub. If Britain agreed to mutual enforcement of standards with the EU, it could not then agree to sign a separate deal with other countries (such as China) involving separate standards. Perhaps Britain could do a deal in which certain sectors were effectively part of the Customs Union, as the government seems to have promised Nissan? Such a deal would have to be ratified by all other EU members, making it hostage to one intransigent Parliament. Worst of all, Canada's free trade deal does not cover services, the area where Britain tends to have a trade surplus; 37% of Britain's services exports go to the EU. A deal that lets German cars into Britain but prevents British accountants and lawyers from selling to German clients would not be not a good one. As the paper concludes The UK seems to be more wedded to its red lines but also risks losing more by not modifying them All this will require a lot of patient negotiation, which seems unlikely to be completed by March 2019 when the formal date for EU exit may occur. So that may require an interim period in which Britain maintains the EU trading arrangements, including free labour movement and budget contributions. That might be economically sensible (some think Britain may choose to continue in this limbo forever). But it would be politically tricky; Theresa May would face the 2020 electorate with Britain still effectively in the EU.
