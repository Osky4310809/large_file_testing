Byrd wrote on Facebook that the decision to fire his wife had come from the \"home office\" and not the Corydon location. As the silence from Cracker Barrel stretched out, the Internet took notice. It got a little nuts from there. Hashtags were born. Memes were made and hilarity ensued.\nOnce the Internet has found something fun to do, it doesn't stop playing. The continued silence of Cracker Barrel fanned the flames.\nThere's always one guy who doesn't get the joke.\nThe absolute worst thing you can do once the Internet has decided it wants something is to tell it it's wrong. Bad move.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/03/23/what-why-did-cracker-barrel-fire-brads-wife/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/lifestyle/user-content/36/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-11.51.38-PM.png", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/lifestyle/user-content/36/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-24-at-12.05.43-AM.png", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/lifestyle/user-content/36/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-11.49.16-PM.png", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/lifestyle/user-content/36/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-11.44.06-PM.png", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/lifestyle/user-content/36/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-24-at-12.20.34-AM.png", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/lifestyle/user-content/36/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-11.52.51-PM.png", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/lifestyle/user-content/36/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-11.53.11-PM.png", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/lifestyle/user-content/36/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-11.44.44-PM.png", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/lifestyle/user-content/36/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-24-at-12.20.34-AM-300x145.png"], "published": "2017-03-24T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:14:31.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
