The home-grown Filipino cager will be spending the summer break early after his Creighton Bluejays fell in the hands of te Rhode Island Rams, 84-72, in the first round of the NCAA \"March Madness\" basketball tournament in the United States, Saturday, Manila time. The 6-foot-6 Paras was fielded into the game only in the final 1:51 of the second half. But as soon as he took the floor, he drilled a three-pointer to bring his squad to within 67-80. Paras also corralled a rebound in two minutes of action with the Big East No. 3 Creighton. Thank you to all blue jay fans that have been there for us through thick and thin! I'm already looking forward to next season. #GoJays \n— Kobe | KoKo Wave (@_kokoparas) March 18, 2017 There's nothing to be ashamed though as Paras is only in his first year with the Bluejays. Before joining Creighton, the son of PBA great Benjie was touting an average of 3.25 (out of five) stars as a recruit in the scouting arena. He is one of the two Filipinos currently looking for a crack at the National Basketball Association. The other one is Kiefer Ravena, who is currently juggling tasks with Alab Pilipinas and the Texas Legends, Dallas' Mavericks NBA D-League affiliate.
