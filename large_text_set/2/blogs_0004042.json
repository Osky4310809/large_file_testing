Benedict Bermange looks at the stats behind his record reign as skipper \nCook, England's leading scorer in Tests with 11,057 runs, became captain in August 2012 and led his country to Ashes glory on home soil in 2013 and 2015 as well as series wins in India and South Africa. \nBut England were held at home by Pakistan in 2016, and then thumped 4-0 by India over the winter. \nSky sources understand that England's players were informed of Cook's decision by email on Sunday evening, and the opener followed this up with individual telephone calls. Sky Sports News HQ understand the new captain will be appointed before England fly out to the West Indies - where they are playing an ODI series - on 22 February. Joe Root is favourite to succeed Cook as skipper. \nCook said: \"It's been a huge honour to be England captain and to lead the Test team over the past five years. Cook led England in a record 59 Test matches \n\"Stepping down has been an incredibly hard decision but I know this is the correct decision for me and at the right time for the team. \n\"I've had time to reflect after the India series and this weekend I spoke to Colin Graves, the Chairman, to explain and offer my resignation. Cook intends to play on this year \n\"It's a sad day personally in many ways but I want to thank everyone I've captained, all the coaches and support staff and, of course, the England supporters and the Barmy Army who follow us home and away and have given us unwavering support. \n\"Playing for England really is a privilege and I hope to carry on as a Test player, making a full contribution and helping the next England captain and the team however I can. Cook and his England team-mates celebrate winning the Ashes \nEngland director of cricket and Cook's predecessor Andrew Strauss said: \"I want to thank Alastair on behalf of the ECB and from a personal perspective for the fantastic contribution that he's made to the England Test team since 2012. \n\"His country owes him a great debt of gratitude; he's led the team with determination, conviction and a huge amount of pride over the last five years and his record stands for itself. \n\"With more matches leading the team than anyone, including two Ashes wins, he deserves to be seen as one of our country's great captains.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T13:38:01.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
