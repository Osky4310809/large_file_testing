By: FE Online | Updated: March 26, 2017 2:22 PM \nIn the wake of a crackdown on the illegal and mechanized slaughterhouses in the Uttar Pradesh, meat sellers have gone on an indefinite strike. \nIn the wake of a crackdown on the illegal and mechanized slaughterhouses in the Uttar Pradesh, meat sellers have gone on an indefinite strike. This move comes after Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath had ordered to ban all slaughterhouses without a license. Tunday Kababi, Lucknow’s one of the iconic eateries, was also one of the victims of this crackdown. Out of 186 slaughterhouses, there are only 40 legal slaughterhouses in the Uttar Pradesh and no legal slaughterhouse near Lucknow, affecting the supply of meat and the livelihood of the sellers in the state. \nPiqued by the government’s decision, meat sellers have called for a shutdown by shutting down their shops for an indefinite period of time. As reported by the New Indian express,”The mutton and chicken sellers have shut down their shops and have threatened to intensify the stir from Monday,” said Mubeen Qureshi of the Lucknow Bakra Gosht Vypar Mandal. “The meat sellers are annoyed over the crackdown on slaughter houses which has adversely hit the livelihood of lakhs of people”. He also added that the fishermen too may join the protest. \nThe associations of meat sellers in Lucknow had announced on Saturday that they will close their outlets for an indefinite period. \nIn order to mollify meat and chicken sellers, BJP leader Mazhar Abbas appealed that the ban was against the slaughterhouses carrying illegal license and only they will face the government action. It won’t affect the genuine ones, according to a PTI report. \nA Member of Lucknow Murga Mandi Samiti, an association of chicken sellers, Razwan Siddiqui said,”In most cases, chicken and mutton are sold from the same shops. Chicken shops do not require any separate license or slaughterhouse, police officials are forcing mutton shops to down shutters, thereby inadvertently stopping these shopkeepers from selling chicken as well,” \nHe also added that “We don’t want our shops to get sealed by authorities, so we have decided to shut them. If sealed, it would take months to get them opened again. By closing them, we can at least start some other business there,” as reported by the Indian Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T11:54:35.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
