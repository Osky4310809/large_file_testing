Even quoting or retweeting an incorrect statement would be illegal. \n“ At a time when political leaders are promoting ‘alternative facts’ and branding unflattering reporting as ‘fake news,’ we don’t think it’s a good idea to give the government more power to punish speech, ” said Dave Maas, an investigative researcher for the EFF. \nVia RT .
