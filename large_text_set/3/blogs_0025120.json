Though we still don't have anything official, we do now have a poster leak with a European release date of September 8. \nThe poster has leaked from GameStop Italy and suggests that PlayStation 4 players will have early beta access to the game too. Bungie hasn't confirmed whether or not this release date is accurate but we will update with any update as it comes. You can see the leaked poster below: \nOriginal article continues below... \nWhen Destiny dropped in 2014, gamers were initially sceptical of its messy story and repetitive content. But over time, and through the release of some major expansions including The Taken King and Rise of Iron, the game has built a reputation as a solid MMO shooter that looks and handles exceptionally well. Three years on, fans are still flocking to it in their millions. \nDestiny 2 is now waiting in the wings, and ahead of its scheduled release later this year we’ve gathered all the news, rumours and info about the game into one place. This is everything you need to know about Bungie’s blockbuster sequel. Cut to the chase What is it? The highly-anticipated anticipated follow up to MMO shooter Destiny When it is out? Fall 2017 (Q3) Will Destiny 2 launch on PC? Probably – but it's far from certain Destiny 2 developers : Bungie and High Moon Studios Destiny 2 publisher: Activision Blizzard Destiny 2 price : TBA, but most likely £49.99/$59.99 Destiny 2 Release date \nDestiny 2 will drop later this year. The game was initially due to release in 2016, but was pushed back to make sure it was everything fans hoped it to be. There were worries that it would experience further delays – but Bungie has come out and promised a 2017 Fall (Q3) release. Phew. Destiny 2 PC \nPC gamers are clamouring for Destiny 2 – and it would seem like a perfect fit for the platform, which has long been the spiritual home of the MMO. It would also give Bungie access to a huge new audience. \nAnd, from what sources are saying, PC gamers will get their wish. The rumour of a PC release started on NeoGAF in September, when a forum user claiming to have inside knowledge said Activision staff had been told there would be a PC version. This was backed up by Kotaku , quoting sources close to the game. \nBungie has not yet confirmed a PC release, but Activision Blizzard has said that Destiny 2 will “broaden the franchise’s global reach”, despite dropping the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game. That sounds very much like it’s coming to the mouse and keyboard… Destiny 2 confirmed features \nActivision and Bungie have played their cards very close to their chest – so, as of yet, there are very few confirmed features. However, there are a few things that are nailed on. \nA cinematic story \nGamers will be glad to hear that the developers are placing more emphasis on the story and characters this time around. \"The cornerstone...is a great cinematic story,\" Activision exec Eric Hirshberg said earlier this year . \"That's been a real focus with a great cast of memorable, relatable characters.” Bring it on. \nLots of expansions \nThis is hardly unexpected given the success of Destiny’s myriad updates and add-ons, but Activision has confirmed that it has “follow-on content plans” for Destiny 2. That likely means the team will be listening to players and tailoring the future experience – expect fresh content, gameplay changes, and cosmetic add-ons. \nMore accessible for “casual players” \n‘Casual’ has become a bit of a dirty word in some gaming circles, but Activision and Bungie are clear about their intention to make their game more open to all. \"We've made it more accessible to someone who just wants to have a great more casual first-person action experience... without losing anything that our core players love,” Hirschberg said . What that means in practice is not clear, but we hope it means a game with less grinding and more varied gameplay. \nCharacter continuity with the first game (to some extent) \nWe don’t know how Destiny 2 will handle player’s Guardians from the first game (more on that in the rumours section below), but we know there will be some continuity. “That idea is that the Guardian you have created is something you can bring along with you on that adventure,” Community Manager David Dague told IGN in 2014. “If you take a look at the way people have played other games for a long period of time, they’ve had a relationship with the same character for a very long time.” Intriguing. Destiny 2 Rumors \nA game with this much hype always attract a deep well of rumours – and the gaming community has not disappointed. Here’s a round-up of the most plausible ones (in order of plausibility). \nDestiny 2 will start from scratch – without previous player characters \nOkay, so this runs contrary to what the Destiny team said about continuity in 2014 – but that was three years ago, and a lot can happen in development. Numerous rumours suggest that Destiny players will not be able to transfer their characters over to the sequel, and that the team behind Destiny 2 – led by the minds that created The Taken King – will overhaul the story, combat, and mission design. “D2 is a completely different game,” one source familiar with development told Kotaku . “ The Taken King was a reboot for Destiny 1 to fix small things. This is the overhaul to fix big things.” \nA focus on the Cabal – with a battle in the Tower \nDestiny 2’s main antagonists will be the Cabal, the war rhinos that featured in the first game, rumours suggest. First, we have a report from industry insider shinobi602 , who has called things right in the past. He/she says the Cabal will be a “major focus” - and that is backed up by the unlikeliest of sources: Mega Bloks toys . A toy appeared on Amazon showing the Cabal battling Guardians in the Tower, the player hub from Destiny that saw no combat at all. One to watch. \nMore dense hubs, called “play-in destinations” \nOne from Kotaku and shinobi602 , who both say that Destiny 2 will contain more detailed hub areas bustling with activities. “They're going to do more open playspaces that incorporate towns, outposts, etc into more common areas,” says shinobi602, while Kotaku has a name for these spaces: “play-in destinations”. These will make Destiny 2’s planet areas “feel more populated with towns, outposts, and quests,” the report said – which would be welcome. \nSet on Saturn? \nShinobi602 says the game will be largely set on Saturn, which will be bigger than all of the areas in Destiny 1 combined. This has not been confirmed by other sources. \nDestiny 2: Forge of Hope? \nThis one has been straight up denied by Bungie, but they do have a history of rubbishing rumours that go on to be true. Reddit user Inside_Leaks , claiming to be a Bungie insider, said that the game will be called Destiny 2: Forge of Hope. The game will be built with a whole new engine, and will be a console exclusive to PS4 for three months. It’s worth taking with a pinch of salt, as no other sources have backed up the information. Destiny 2 wish list \nDestiny was a great game, but it wasn't without its issues. Here are our top picks for features we hope make it into the sequel. \nRaid matchmaking \nOne of Destiny’s big problems is that to play raids – a staple of MMOs and some of the best bits of the game – you had to team up with five people on your friends list. There is no way to play with gamers that you don’t know, which locks out vast swathes of the community. What Destiny 2 needs is a rock-solid matchmaking system to bring you and other randoms together, lowering the bar for entry. The team have confirmed they are “thinking about” it – which is a good start. \nSpaceship battles \nPerhaps a pipe dream, but how cool would it be if Destiny 2’s spaceships were more than just glorified loading screens? Piloting one into a dogfight could prove an awesome distraction from the core content, and would give you reason to explore the world, finding materials to upgrade your ship. \nA fleshed-out campaign \nDestiny’s single player content was undoubtedly one of its weaknesses: if you weren’t willing to pair up with friends then you’d get little from the game. A fully-fledged campaign with voiceacting – which we saw in The Taken King – and a meaningful story would add a lot. \nMore varied gameplay, including in player hubs \nDestiny’s environments looked great, but they often felt constrained because there simply wasn’t enough to do in them. In Destiny 2, we’re hoping Bungie inject more imagination into the mission types. There’s only so many bullet-sponge bosses you can defeat or hordes you can fend off before you get bored. We’d also like a dense hub bustling with shops, minigames, and perhaps even missions to occupy players that don’t want to venture out into the wild. Think the Citadel in Mass Effect, with players going about their business and impacting on the hub itself. The rumours bode well for this one. \nMore customisation \nDestiny did offer a fair amount of customisation and weapon variety, and you could paint your character’s armour as you pleased. But fans are asking for more: it would be nice to be able to decorate yourself with individually-coloured armour pieces, decals, and other bells and whistles, as well as having the option of changing your appearance after the start of the game (even if it was as simple as being able to change your hair-do…). \nWhat are you hoping for in Destiny 2? Are their any rumours we’ve missed out? Let us know in the comments section below.
