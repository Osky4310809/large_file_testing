Reynolds and his Life co-star Jake Gyllenhaal talked to ET's Carly Steel at the South by Southwest premiere of their new movie over the weekend, where the 40-year-old actor admitted that having kids has given him a little bit of anxiety. \"I think you're just more desperate in everything you do cause you're like,\" he shared. \"'I've got 10 minutes to do this, and then I gotta get home for a thing, and a thing, and a thing...'\" \"There's just no time anymore, so you're hardened by it,\" he added. \"Anxiety, I think, that's probably it.\" Yep, parenthood will do that to you! Thankfully, Reynolds has the support of wife Blake Lively to lean on as the couple raises their two daughters, 2-year-old James, and 5-month-old Ines. Another thing the Deadpool star has -- bro companionship!

Gyllenhaal agreed, \"It's a beauty that is unmatched pretty much anywhere, I would think.\" \"Though Garth Brooks may try his hand,\" Gyllenhaal jokingly added. \"I don't think he would come close.\" [Bing] Crosby and [Fred] Astaire gave it a shot back in [the 1942 film] Holiday Inn, and a few other ones, but nope, not a chance,\" Reynolds riffed.
