That number, reported by Sea Shepherd , is shocking. According to the reports, divers were choosing the future fate of the animals, selecting which were to be sold to marine parks and which right away killed for their meat. This is not an isolated case as the dolphin hunt is a tradition in the area. \nFortunately, the dolphins have found a powerful spokesperson to plead their case, Slash. Slash, best known as the lead guitarist of Guns N’ Roses, commented on the situation calling the practice “deplorable” and urged people to recognize the terrible reality of the situation . \n“It’s the kind of thing that just has to stop,” he said, “and I think that it’s possible to put an end to it. It’s just gonna take more and more people speaking up.” The artist recognized that in order to make a change there is a strong need for us to “stop the market” and rethink our choices when it comes to buying tickets to aquariums. \nClick here to visit Sea Shepherd’s website and find out what you can do to help the organization.
