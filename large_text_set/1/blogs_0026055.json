People who value other people and value other religions,” said Marwan Kreidie, executive director of the Philadelphia Arab-American development corporation. \nREAD: Iran To Ban US Citizens In Response To Trump’s Order \n“We don’t know what will happen,” Kreidie said. “I mean just imagine we are telling people not to go out of the country because they may not be allowed back in the country that they live in that they have families in. I believe it’s mind boggling. I believe it’s illegal, its immoral, it’s nothing that one would expect. \nKreidie says the irony of the president’s order is that it was signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day. \n“And we’ve got to remember that Jewish refugees from Germany were denied the ability to come to the United States prior to World War II and a lot of them went back and they were killed, and this could happen to people,” he said. “These people who are fleeing for their lives are being sent back to areas of danger and we should be ashamed of ourselves as a country.” \nCommunity meetings are being planned for the coming days.
