They were raised differently and to show emotion and passion when you play. We do show emotion; we do show passion. But we just do it in a different way.\" Kinsler and the rest of the United States team will square off with Puerto Rico in the championship game Wednesday. The World Baseball Classic tweeted out what could be seen as an appropriate response to Kinsler's comments after Puerto Rico beat the Netherlands to reach the title clash: WBC Baseball @WBCBaseball 3/21/2017, 5:35:47 AM There is no doubt the Puerto Rico team has been one of the most expressive during the tournament. The players have used blond hair dye and displayed genuine emotion and pride as they compete for their country. Some of the most exciting, young players in baseball are on the roster, including the Chicago Cubs' Javier Baez, the Cleveland Indians' Francisco Lindor and the Houston Astros' Carlos Correa. Bill Baer of NBC Sports argued the energy Puerto Rico has displayed is critical to attracting more fans to the sport and noted, \"Baez did more to make baseball appeal to new and lapsed audiences with his premature celebration tag than the entire U.S. team has done this tournament.\" Kansas City Royals infielder Christian Colon, who is a Puerto Rico native, responded to Kinsler's comments, per Rustin Dodd of the Kansas City Star : \"It's the truth. We got flair, and he don't.\" Puerto Rico has enjoyed plenty of opportunities to celebrate since it is undefeated in this year's tournament and already beat the United States in pool play. The players will surely unleash a memorable and well-deserved celebration Wednesday if they beat Kinsler and his teammates again.
