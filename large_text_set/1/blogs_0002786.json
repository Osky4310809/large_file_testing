Donald Trump’s transition aides and House Republicans are preparing a proposal for the long-promised wall by using “a 2006 law signed by former President George W. Bush that authorized the construction of 700 miles-plus of ‘physical barrier’ on the southern border” that never came with a sunset provision, report POLITICO’s Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan .\nAnd what about the plan for Mexico to pay for it? That part wouldn’t happen.\n“The plan is an implicit acknowledgment by Republicans and the incoming administration that Mexico will not pay for the border wall — a promise from Trump that was always viewed skeptically. Instead, American tax dollars will.”\nInstead, if carried out, the cost to build just the wall — not including other expenses such as border control and maintenance — could range from a few billion dollars to as much as $14 billion and it would ultimately fall on taxpayers.\nRepublicans are considering whether to tuck the funding into a must-pass spending bill in April, and possibly baiting Democrats into a government shutdown showdown.\nWhether Republicans are planning the Westeros-eque border wall Trump described during the campaign or something a bit less grandiose remains to be seen. In describing the law and the plan, House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Luke Messer said they would begin “the building out of hundreds of miles of wall, or fence, on the southern border.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T03:52:47.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
