Volkswagen is offering two versions – the R-Line exterior package and R-Line package – for customers to choose from. \nThe exterior package is exactly as described, and tags on a full bodykit that includes a R-Line front bumper with a honeycomb mesh lower intake and air intake screens in high-gloss black, as well as a new rear bumper accompanied by a diffuser and trapezoidal-shaped, chrome-finished exhaust tips. \nOther additions include a rear spoiler with package-specific aero flaps and R-Line badges on the front grille and side panels. For those who are still left wanting, the R-Line package gets the same additions as the exterior package, but sees some further modifications, including in the cabin as well. \nFor starters, there are new R-Line sport seats in a “Carbon Flag/San Remo” design, or an optional “Vienna” leather (perforated) in Black-Crystal Grey. Adding to this is a leather-wrapped, multifunction sport steering wheel with contrast stitching and R-Line badge, “Dark Diamond Flag” inlays and black rooflining. \nThat’s not all as additional contrast stitching on the gear shift boot and floor mats, plus there are some stainless steel bits (door sills, pedal caps, foot rest) and a R-Line logo on the display start screen. Buyers also get to choose from a selection of wheels – 17 or 18-inch “Sebring” alloys, 17-inch “Singapore” alloys, and 18-inch “Marseille” alloys.
