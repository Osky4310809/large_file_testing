With Spring Boot, you will be able to develop a stand-alone, production grade application, in easy to deploy JAR or WAR formats. \nMicroservices are a compilation of independently deployable, small and modular application services. Each microservice has defined input and output exposed through RESTful endpoints. As a result, you can scale, replace and link to other services, such as caching, without any architectural changes. \nThis 3-week course covers : Introduction to REST and Microservices Building a RESTful Java Application with Spring Boot Automating Build and Deploy with Developer Cloud Services \nThe MOOC format: Available to anyone at no charge.
