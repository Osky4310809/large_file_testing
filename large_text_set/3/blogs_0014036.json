Russian annexation of Crimea alarms Georgia \nThe deal would allow the Russian military to recruit South Ossetian soldiers as contractors, but they would first have to be dismissed from active duty by South Ossetia, reported Tass. \nLeonid Tibilov, the de-facto leader of South Ossetia, said last year the self-declared republic would retain its army while part of its military would serve in the Russian armed forces. \n\"Transfer of some units of South Ossetian Armed Forces into the Russian army is at variance with the Russian legislation, that is why additional agreements to the Treaty on Alliance and Integration between South Ossetia signed in March 2015 will specify that some South Ossetian military will be integrated into units of the Russian Federation, notably the 4th Russian military base stationed in the republic,\" Tibilov was quoted as saying by Tass. \nHe also said it was not yet clear how many military servicemen would go into Russian units. \nThe Georgian government issued a statement condemning Russia's move, saying the decision was \"one more obvious step towards de-facto annexation of South Ossetia\". \n\"We call on the international community to assess in a proper way the so-called agreement and to demand that Russia fulfils international obligations,\" the statement said. \nRussia recognised South Ossetia as an independent state in 2008 after fighting a short war with Georgia. \nGeorgia says it wants South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another breakaway region, back.
