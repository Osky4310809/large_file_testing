In the ad, entitled \"Take Mine\", a young lady arrives at a Greek village to visit her grandmother. After greeting each other with open arms, the two women are seen sitting in a café, where the granddaughter uses a Rose Gold iPhone 7 Plus to take a picture of the elderly woman using the Depth Effect. After previewing the shot, her grandma stands up in awe, taken aback by its quality. This catches the attention of others in the café, and a woman asks if she can get a picture, too. The young lady happily obliges. Thus begins a spree of depth-of-field photography as locals in the village queue up to have their pictures taken, including fishermen, a musician, children, a barber, and even a local shepherd, all framed in sharp focus with the familiar blurred background effect. The ad ends with the tagline, \"Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus – practically magic\". Today's iPhone 7 Plus ad is the latest in a series that have showcased the features of Apple's latest handsets, like waterproofing, improved battery life, the camera, and the iOS 10 operating system . Apple has also previously shared tips to \" Shoot like a Pro \" with the depth-of-field effect in the iPhone 7 Plus, highlighting a range of suggestions collected from professional photographers on its news site. Franjelisco 1 hour ago at 12:51 pm Τhank you Apple for showing another face of Greece! It's always about us being lazy scums, not paying our debts and trying to get away with everything... Thank you Apple for showing the world that our country is of exceptional beauty, our people are compassionate and loving and that it's not always about money, it's also about the little things in life! You are the best!!! Rating: 8 Votes Yellowbean12 1 hour ago at 12:51 pm As a photographer, I really appreciate this advert. Background defocus and bokeh are often really important aspects of all photography, especially portraits. I just wonder if the average viewer of this advert will even understand what's going on. Maybe I worry too much. Maybe this is a good example of Apple not treating its customers as idiots, and treating them instead as people who love photography and understand many aspects of it. Rating: 4 Votes 1 hour ago at 12:46 pm Actually a great ad. Jim Lahey 31 minutes ago at 01:35 pm Great camera, cool commercial. Shame the phone is the size of a chopping board. I'm looking forward to this feature being added to the real iPhone. I still think 'portrait mode' is a poorly chosen name though. Rating: 2 Votes aroom 42 minutes ago at 01:24 pm if only Apple could stop fragmenting the iPhone and give to both models the same camera options. I don't want to have a bigger phone and yes I do want to have this feature. awesome feature. so lame IMO Phone Junky 18 minutes ago at 01:48 pm You don't know what you're missing until you get a bigger phone. You won't want to go back, especially with all that extra battery life. Had the bigger phone. Don't miss it. Don't want one again. Battery life on my 7 is excellent. Rating: 1 Votes blasto2236 22 minutes ago at 01:44 pm Love the ad. It's actually quite true. I snapped a really great shot of a relative over Christmas, the first photo he had liked of himself in ages, and suddenly everyone wanted it sent to them and their own similar portrait taken. It really is a great feature. I snag the perfect shot on the first attempt nearly every time. It doesn't work very well in low light, but other than that it's aces. It also kind of guides you in to the perfect conditions before it will even snap, which is nice.

The \"portrait\" mode on the 7+ doesn't work well indoors even with good ambient light. Outdoor in the day may be fine. There are some good pocket cameras now that link with your phone to share photos and I carry a Canon G7XMkII with me, but yes when I don't have it the 7+ works and is better than no camera.
