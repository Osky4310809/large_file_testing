Previewed by the QX50 Concept from this year’s Detroit Auto Show, the test mule seen here appears to retain some of the styling cues of the show car, with a few tweaks to be production ready. \nAt the front, the Infiniti grille is retained, flanked by a pair of headlights that are reminiscent of those found on the Q60 coupe . The corner intakes on the front bumper are also reshaped here, each with a fog lamp beneath them. Other changes from the concept include a more prominent lower intake, previously a large skid plate. \nThe QX50’s profile also appears to be carried over, with Infiniti masking off the C-pillar in an attempt to hide what should the kink beneath it, as seen on the concept. The character line that originates from the front bonnet, proceeding through the door handles beneath the beltline, is also seen here. If that isn’t enough, even the wheels look like the fan blade units from the Detroit debutant. \nA view of the rear shows us a set of stylish taillights, which are two-piece units with part of them being found on the tailgate, just like on the concept. The exhaust outlets aren’t as pleasing to look at but as this is merely a prototype, they should be changed to closer mimic those on the concept. \nInfiniti has hinted that its new variable compression ratio 2.0L VC-Turbo engine may make its way into the QX50 when it goes on sale sometime in 2018, although we’ll have to wait for the carmaker to reveal the car in full for more details. Other technologies that are said to feature include autonomous driving systems, likely adopted from Nissan’s ProPilot . \nGALLERY: Infiniti QX50 Concept", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:55:01.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
