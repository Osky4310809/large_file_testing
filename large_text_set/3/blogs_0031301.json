Some even measure up to 1.7 meters (5 feet, 6 inches) in length. \nDr. Steven Salisbury describes the diversity of the tracks as globally unparalleled. He says, \nIt’s is extremely significant, forming the record of non-avian dinosaurs in the western half of the continent and providing the only glimpse of Australia’s dinosaur fauna during the first half of the Early Cretaceous Period. Giphy \nHe added, \nThere are thousands of tracks around Walmadany. Of these, 150 can confidently be assigned to 21 specific track types, representing four main groups of dinosaurs. \nAmong the tracks is the only confirmed evidence for stegosaurus in Australia. There are also some of the largest dinosaur tracks ever recorded. Some of the sauropod tracks are around 1.7m long. \nSo, really, it’s just a matter of time before they can make dinosaurs real again to devour you, right? \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
