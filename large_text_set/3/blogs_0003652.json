With 608 PS (600 bhp) and 900 Nm (663 lb. ft.) delivering a 0-60 mph time of 4.0 seconds (0-100 km/h in 4.1 seconds) and a top speed of 187 mph (301 km/h), the Bentayga is the world's fastest SUV. \nProduced in very limited numbers due to the highly complex, handcrafted nature of the Bentayga Mulliner's luxurious interior features, this new flagship model will be available to order in Spring 2017. \nA special one-off example of the Bentley Bentayga Mulliner will be on the Bentley stand in Geneva next week, featuring a unique inlay to the front fascia depicting the stunning Monte Rosa mountain range in exquisite hand-crafted marquetry. \nAn Extraordinary Mulliner Exterior \nThe Bentley Bentayga Mulliner is the most exquisitely appointed luxury SUV ever created, and will appeal to owners searching for the pinnacle of go-anywhere motoring, with the finest performance and comfort. 2018 Bentley Bentayga Mulliner \nThis new model introduces striking optional Duo Tone paintwork for the first time on Bentayga. The elegant finish is achieved by choosing the perfect proportional balance point for the split, the resulting effect making the cabin and bonnet appear as though floating. The split also serves to enhance the Bentayga's trademark super-formed muscularity and accentuates its powerful presence. Duo Tone paintwork will be available across the Bentayga range from April. \nThe new Mulliner 22\" Paragon seven-spoke wheels with floating wheel centres, unique exterior badge, and the addition as standard of body-coloured lower bodywork and bright chromed lower bumper grilles, complete the exterior enhancements. \nThe Ultimate Handcrafted Interior \nInside, Mulliner has combined traditional and modern coachbuilding design. A new Mulliner designed interior colour split - with the front and rear seats finished in different hide colours and offered in seven suggested colour ways - complements the optional Duo Tone exterior paintwork. The hand-stitched hides are finished with unique Mulliner embroidery and contrast stitching. \nBespoke features by Mulliner include a new Mulliner Bottle Cooler in the rear of the cabin, featuring an illuminated chilling cabinet and bespoke Cumbria Crystal flutes, all   generously proportioned, rear centre console. \nOmbr√© Burr Walnut Veneer is exclusively introduced to the Bentayga Mulliner model. This showcases a unique wood transition from Black through to Burr Walnut as the veneer wraps around the interior and a special veneered panel replaces the standard central console fascia. \nMood lighting, comprising six different 'moods', together with illuminated Mulliner tread plates and Bentley LED Welcome Lamps, create a luxurious night-time ambience. Bentayga Mulliner also offers owners the chance to create their own bespoke ambience, with 'My Mood', which allows occupants to choose from 15 different colours, while also adjusting the brightness in doors, armrests and footwells. \nLuxury in Audio, Comfort and Convenience \nThe Naim for Bentley Audio system in the Bentayga Mulliner is the most powerful, highest quality audio system in the class, featuring twenty speakers driven by a 1,950-watt, 21-channel amplifier. \nA convenient, remote-controlled Parking Heater function allows the vehicle interior to be heated or cooled when the engine is switched off, while electric rear window blinds and a double sun-visor are also available with the Sunshine Specification. \nThe Touring and City Specifications enhance the comprehensive suite of standard driver assistance features, including Park Assist, Lane Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, Traffic Assist, Night Vision and a Head-Up Display. \nThe Bentley Bentayga Mulliner also benefits from Bentley Dynamic Ride - the world's first electric active roll control technology that utilises an unrivalled 48V system. This system instantly counteracts lateral rolling forces when cornering and ensures maximum tyre contact to deliver class-leading cabin stability, ride comfort and exceptional handling. \nThe flagship Bentayga is also available with the exquisite optional Linley Hamper by Mulliner, complete with refrigerator, bespoke fine Linley china cutlery, crockery and crystal glass, and storage area for dry goods. For comfort in the great outdoors, sections can be removed and used as seats. \nAnother striking option is the bespoke mechanical Mulliner Tourbillon by Breitling clock. The most complex of watch mechanisms, the Mulliner Tourbillon features 196 individual pieces and is automatically wound periodically by a dedicated high-precision winding mechanism within the car. This masterpiece is machined in solid gold (customers can select from yellow, white or rose gold), with a choice of either a mother-of-pearl or black ebony face and decorated with eight diamond indexes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:27:14.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
