Andrew Hoyle/CNET Is the Honda Civic Type R or Ford Focus RS the better hot hatchback? Debating the merits of the two freshest sport compacts to come to America. by Antuan Goodwin Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF \nFor Honda enthusiasts in the US, the debut of the 2017 Civic Type R at the Geneva Motor Show is significant. Previous generations of Honda's halo performance sport compact were sold in major markets like Japan and Europe, but not in America -- leaving Honda fanboys and fangirls here out in the cold. The arrival of the latest Type R is different because it will be hitting showrooms here late this spring. \nThe wait for the new Civic Type R is almost over. Andrew Hoyle/CNET \nThe first Honda Type R model to officially be sold in the United States lands at a time where there is a good number of formidable opposition in the track-bred compact car class. While the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution has faded away, old segment stalwarts like the Subaru WRX STI and Volkswagen Golf R remain. Then there is the Ford Focus RS , which itself is a newer entry in the US market after years of terrorizing European streets and race tracks. \nThe Roadshow staff happens to think extremely highly of the RS, having done plenty of smokey drifts in one and even pitting it against a more expensive thoroughbred performance machine in the BMW M2 . With some details of the production Civic Type R in hand, we couldn't help but draw some comparisons between the Honda and the Ford. \nSimilarities are vast with both being five-door hatchbacks powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Both feature good old fashion six-speed manual transmissions, adaptive suspension systems and Brembo front brakes. Each car will cost enthusiasts roughly the same amount of money with the RS starting at $36,120, while Honda is saying the Type R will begin in the mid-$30,000 range.
