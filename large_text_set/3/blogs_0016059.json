She wonders why skeptics can’t just let people believe in her ability to talk to their dead loved ones. \nTheresa Caputo is not bothered in the slightest if you don’t believe that she’s a medium. \nThe TV personality and star of “Long Island Medium” on TLC has plenty of believers and says if you’re not one of them, that’s OK, too. \n“I’m not asking anyone to believe in what I do. Everyone has a right to their own opinion,” Caputo said in a recent telephone interview. \nWhat she doesn’t understand is how skeptics think people who do believe in psychic readings are wrong: “How can someone tell someone that what they’re experiencing isn’t real?” \nCaputo believes that if someone has a session with a medium and then walks away feeling uplifted and empowered, people should respect that. \nBecause “what they’re experiencing” only happens because they believe your lies. They get all emotional thinking that you really are passing messages on to them from their dead family and friends, but we know that you aren’t. We know the centuries-old cold reading techniques you use, we know how they work and we know why people fall for your act. And we know that you’re getting very rich taking advantage of their gullibility. It’s not about them, it’s about you. And you’re a con artist that needs to be called out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:29:26.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
