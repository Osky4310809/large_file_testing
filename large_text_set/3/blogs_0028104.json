Of the group, she noted that one was about 10-year-old. Watts asked United for an explanation.\nUnited responded to Watts on Twitter, writing that they “have the right to refuse transport for passengers who are barefoot or not properly clothed.” They later clarified that the girls in question were “pass travelers,” or travelers flying on comped or discounted tickets, typically reserved for employees and their family members. United explained that they have a stricter dress code for pass travelers as they are representing the United brand.\nStill, stars like Chrissy Teigen and William Shatner joined the list of people speaking out against United’s confusing policy on Twitter.\n“I have flown united before with literally no pants on. Just a top as a dress,” wrote Teigen, 31. “Next time I will wear only jeans and a scarf.”\nPatricia Arquette also shared her thoughts on Twitter.\n“Why aren’t you allowing girls to wear leggings on flights?” she wrote. “Who is your gate agent policing girls clothing? “Was there something’s strange about all these girls leggings? Do U understand U have just made at least half UR customers very unhappy?”\n“Leggings are business attire for 10 year olds. Their business is being children,” the actress continued. “Y did dad board wearing shorts? Shorts R only business attire 4 Angus Young.”\n“Turns out United bans leggings, torn jeans, and shorter shorts for free employee pass tickets. Still @united should update policy,” she added.\nI have flown united before with literally no pants on. Just a top as a dress.
