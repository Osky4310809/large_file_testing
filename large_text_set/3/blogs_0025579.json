Due out via Exploding in Sound, it serves as their fifth overall and the follow-up to 2015’s well-received You’re Better Than This . \nThe 13-track collection was recorded in their hometown at the Record Co., a space whose big windows afforded Pile views that would directly influence their music. “We were at home and we could see the sun and I think both of those things lent themselves to a more focused and deliberate record,” guitarist/vocalist Rick Maguire explained in a press statement. \n(Read: Pile: You’re Cooler Than This ) \nJanuary saw the release of lead single “Texas” ; now, Pile are back with a second offering in “Dogs”. Not unlike the band’s previous material, the track is replete with seamless peaks and valleys, crunchy guitars and Maguire’s hollowed howl. Speaking to Stereogum , Maguire detailed the coming together of the song and how it relates to the rest of the LP: “That was written on tour in 2015. I felt compelled to write it because the stuff that we were touring on the last record was sort of disjointed and weird — there were a lot of moving parts in those songs. I wanted to write something a little more conventional or standard for this album. But as far as what it it’s about… it definitely speaks to the ‘I’d rather be alone’ sort of vibe that set the tone for the rest of the songs on A Hairshirt Of Purpose . The story that the song is about is a little personal, so I don’t know if I feel like divulging too much information.” \nStream it down below. \nA Hairshirt of Purpose lands in stores on March 31st. In support, Pile will hit the road for a US spring tour. \nPile 2017 Tour Dates: 03/16 – Austin, TX @ The Velveeta Room 04/02 – Cambridge, MA @ The Sinclair 04/06 – Brooklyn, NY @ Baby’s All Right 04/07 – Brooklyn, NY @ Sunnyvale 04/12 – Philadelphia, PA @ First Unitarian Church 04/13 – Washington, DC @ DC9 04/14 – Durham, NC @ Duke Coffeehouse 04/15 – Asheville, NC @ The Mothlight 04/16 – Nashville, TN @ Third Man Records 04/17 – Atlanta, GA @ The Masquerade 04/18 – Birmingham, AL @ The Syndicate Lounge 04/19 – Tallahassee, FL @ Club Downunder 04/20 – New Orleans, LA @ Gasa Gasa 04/21 – Houston, TX @ The Satellite Bar 04/22 – Austin, TX @ Sidewinder 04/23 – Dallas, TX @ Three Links 04/26 – Phoenix, AZ @ The Rebel Lounge 04/27 – San Diego, CA @ Soda Bar 04/28 – Los Angeles, CA @ The Echo 04/30 – San Francisco, CA @ Rickshaw Stop 05/02 – Portland, OR @ Mississippi Studios 05/03 – Seattle, WA @ The Black Lodge 05/05 – Salt Lake City, UT @ The Loading Dock 05/06 – Denver, CO @ Lost Lake Lounge 05/07 – Omaha, NE @ River City Star 05/09 – Minneapolis, MN @ 7th St. Entry 05/10 – Milwaukee, WI @ Cactus Club 05/11 – Chicago, IL @ Subterranean 05/12 – Detroit, MI @ Marble Bar 05/13 – Lakewood, OH @ Mahall’s 05/14 – Rochester, NY @ Bug Jar Artists", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T04:30:07.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
