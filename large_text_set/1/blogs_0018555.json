Those cells were found to have an unspecified manufacturing defect caused by ramping up a production line that wasn't ready to scale. In other words, different cause, same problem.\nIn all, Samsung reportedly lost about $5 billion from the Note 7 recall, which didn't hinder its ability to earn record profits in the fourth quarter . But the question of the company's long-term reputation is still very much in the air, especially since it will come to light through this report that corners were cut in expediting the first recall.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 7 Galaxy Note 7 fires, recall and cancellation: Everything you need to know Survey results: Samsung users stay loyal after Note 7 recall Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review The latest Galaxy Note 7 news Join the Note 7 discussion in the forums!
