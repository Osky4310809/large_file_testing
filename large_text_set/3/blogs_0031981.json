A group of people who bring out the best in you, who are a part of all your plans, who make life easier for you, just people you like the best out of the other millions of humans on the planet.

Now, when it comes to the young star Alia Bhat and her squad, we would expect people like Siddharth Malhotra and Varun Dhawan to be a part of it. But, all this time, we were completely wrong. Just last night, Alia Bhatt took to Instagram to post a picture of her real squad which consists of the two most important ladies in her life, her sister, Shaheen and her mother, Soni Razdan. Not to ignore the fact that all three looks really beautiful and Alia Bhatt seems to have gotten a haircut which looks really cute!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T08:42:02.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
