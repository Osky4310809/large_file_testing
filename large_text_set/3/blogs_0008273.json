The smartphone will soon be available in India and will make its debut on March 15. Unlike the previous Moto G series, it will be sold exclusively on Flipkart, and not on Amazon.\nThe smartphone is available in a few different variants and for now, there’s no word on which one will launch in India. The price also remains a mystery for now but will be announced on March 15, along with all the other details.\nAs a refresher, the Moto G5 Plus sports a 5.2-inch Full HD display and is powered by the Snapdragon 625 chipset. It comes with 2, 3, or 4 GB of RAM and 32, or 64 GB of storage, which is expandable (up to 128 GB). You’ll find a 12 MP camera on the back with an f/1.7 aperture and a selfie snapper on the front that has a 5 MP sensor.\nSee also: Moto G5 and G5 Plus hands on: bringing premium looks to the mid-range 1 week ago Other features of the smartphone include a 3,000 mAh battery, a front-mounted fingerprint reader, and a USB Type-C port.
