In case you missed it, Donald Glover has been cast as a young Lando in the upcoming Han Solo film. And while we’re all pretty stoked about it, Williams is finding it hard to witness someone filling his shoes.\nWilliams played Lando in the early ’80s, and has since voiced the character in video games and animated films. He’s the only one who has played the character until now, so we totally get why he’s having trouble.\nBilly Dee Williams met with Donald Glover to chat about his portrayal of Lando Calrissian portrayal in the upcoming film. \nThe legendary actor sat down with the Hollywood Reporter to talk about the new Han Solo film . Of meeting Glover, he said:\n“He’s a very delightful young man, I must say. We had a very nice lunch and we talked for a very long time and it was very easy. He had questions about [Lando]. I guess he was doing what normal actors do, they just want to find out what direction they want to take so they gather their information. So, we just sat and talked, and I didn’t want to impose on anything he wanted to do — he’s got his own ideas, I would imagine. I know he has his own ideas. He’s a very talented young man.” And Williams got real sentimental about his acclaimed role.\n“To me, I guess what it is that I identify so much with Lando,” Williams said. “I mean, Lando has been very much a part of my life for over 30 years. When I go out and do conventions and stuff like that, even though people know me from all the other things that I’ve done, certainly [Lando] takes precedence. I just never thought of anybody else being Lando, I just see myself as Lando.” \nWe completely understand where he’s coming from. And, in spite of his feelings, we’re sure he’ll still be supportive of the new film.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:09:06.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
