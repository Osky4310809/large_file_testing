Beckham caught only four passes for 28 yards on 11 targets and — worse yet — he had three key drops, a potential TD in the second quarter and two others on third-down conversions.\nIf you bet Tavarres King as the Giants leading receiver with three catches for 78 yards and a touchdown, you won a lot of money.\nAs bad as Beckham was in the biggest game of his career, the Giants first playoff appearance in five years, the Giants really were done in by a Hail Mary at the end of the first half.\nHonest.\nYes, the Giants had seen this movie before.

Trey Songz rips Giants DBs as Boatgate defense But five years ago, they were the stars of the show. They were the ones basking in the glow of a euphoric happy ending. They were the ones moving on to an even better place and eventually the Super Bowl.\nIn an utterly uncanny occurrence, the climactic moment of both the 2011 show and the one that played out Sunday night took place at the same time of the game in the same end zone of the same stadium.\nIt came via the Hail Mary pass.\nThis time, though, the Packers were the stars of the show, moving on to play the Cowboys in Sunday’s divisional round in Dallas.\nFive years ago in a divisional playoff game between the Giants and Packers, it was Eli Manning connecting with Hakeem Nicks on a 37-yard Hail Mary on the final play of the half to give the Giants a 20-10 lead in a game they’d go on to win 37-20 en route to the Super Bowl.\nThis time, it was Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Randall Cobb crushing the wills of the Giants defense, with Rodgers launching a Hail Mary into the frigid Green Bay night sky as the Packers’ faithful watched it land into the arms of Cobb with no time remaining for a stunning 14-6 Green Bay lead at the half.\nIt was the second of four touchdown passes by Rodgers, who completed 25-of-40 for 362 yards.\nOn the play, Cobb got away with a push-off on Giants safety Leon Hall just before he leaped into the air and caught the ball in the back of the end zone with Landon Collins, Eli Apple, Keenan Robinson among others around the play.\nThe play capped a demoralizing final few minutes of a first half the Giants defense had mostly dominated.\nThe Giants’ worst sin of the half — other than yielding the killer Hail Mary — was trying to beat Rodgers with field goals.\nWhen the Packers took possession of the ball from the Giants’ 38-yard line with 3:45 remaining in the half, they’d produced a total of 29 yards of offense in the game.\nOn the first play of that series, Rodgers connected with receiver Davante Adams on a 31-yard pass play over the head of Apple, the Giants rookie cornerback, to the Giants 7-yard line.\nSo in one play, the Packers outgained their previous output by 2 yards.\nTwo plays later, Rodgers, after dancing, darting and dodging around the Giants pass rush for a whopping eight seconds, hit Adams on a 5-yard scoring pass to give the Packers a 7-6 lead with 2:20 remaining in the half.\nSo all that work, nearly 28 minutes worth of dominating, and the Giants, who’d taken a 6-0 lead on two Robbie Gould field goals, were losing a game they would soon lose complete control of.\nThe Giants’ only flicker of fire came after Packers coach Mike McCarthy opted to go for a fourth-and-1 from the Green Bay 42-yard line with 6:29 remaining in the third. Ty Montgomery was stopped for a 1-yard loss, giving the Giants the ball at the Green Bay 41 and — more importantly — a jolt of momentum and energy.\nTwo plays later, Manning (23-of-44 for 299 yards, 1 TD and 1 INT) connected with King on a 41-yard TD to cut the Packers led to 14-13. King beat Packers cornerback Damarious Randall in single coverage on the play.\nRodgers and the Packers offense, however, ripped the momentum right back with a 30-yard Rodgers scoring pass to Cobb, who outran cornerback Trevin Wade in the middle of the field to give Green Bay a 21-13 lead with 2:53 remaining in the third.\nThe Packers made it 24-13 on a 32-yard Mason Crosby field goal with 21 seconds remaining in the third.\nRodgers, now toying with the very Giants defense that had confounded him so in the first half, made it 31-13 with a 16-yard scoring strike to Cobb, who beat Apple this time, with 9:19 remaining in the game.\nThe unofficial end for the Giants came with 8:31 remaining in the game when Packers linebacker Clay Matthews sacked Manning, stripped him of the ball and recovered it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T03:27:17.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
