The Washington Post 's Mike Jones confirmed the news. A 3-4 defensive end, McGee projects as the Redskins' replacement for Chris Baker —who reportedly inked a three-year deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday, per FoxSports.coms Peter Schrager . McGee spent the first four years of his career with the Oakland Raiders —whom he posted a farewell message to on Instagram — and he developed at a steady clip as he worked his way into the defensive line rotation.

Those numbers don't jump off the page, but McGee did flash solid pass-rushing chops while operating as a steady presence in run defense as he consistently set the edge thanks to his surprisingly nimble stylings at 6'3\" and 308 pounds. Now on a Redskins team that finished last season ranked 24th overall in average rushing yards allowed (119.8) per game, McGee will be called upon to help set the tone as an integral piece of Washington's front-seven.
