Notable leaker Evan ‘evleaks’ Blass has now put forth some new information, in the form of European pricing and color variants.\nAccording to Mr. Blass , the Samsung Galaxy S8 will start off at €799 ($860; ₹56,260), while the Galaxy S8 Plus will start off at €899 ($966; ₹63,300). Additionally, the new Gear 360 VR camera will reportedly cost €229 ($246; ₹16,125), the Gear VR will cost €129 ($139; ₹9,084) and the DeX docking station will cost €150 ($161; ₹10.560). Evleaks has only revealed the European pricing in his tweet, and direct currency conversions are just given for reference and are not indicative of the pricing that the devices will see in those regions, so expect some variation.\nEvleaks also revealed the color variants of the devices. The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will come in black sky , orchid grey and arctic silver color variants. He was also kind enough to provide images of the color variants (pictured in that order, with S8 in the top row and S8 Plus in the bottom row), but since there is such a thin frame on the actual device, the colors do not really pop in these images.\n\nThe leaked pricing on the S8 and S8 Plus are certainly on the higher end, leaving no doubt that these are premium flagships. Barring any glaring flaw, the next flagships from Samsung are on track to becoming one of the most popular devices in the high-end flagship category.\nWhat are your thoughts on the reported pricing and the color variants of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus?
