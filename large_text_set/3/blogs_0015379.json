We all know what that means, right? 14 long weekends = 14 short trips. But wait... what if you are broke, or injured, or didn't book tickets on time? In other words, not all of us can get out of town every time there are three days off work. It kills us to think that we might be wasting this generous blessing that has been bestowed upon us. But, traveling is not the only way to make the best of a long weekend. If you can't manage an Instagram worthy trip, do these instead: 1. Sleep 2. Have a movie marathon \nAll of us have a long list of movies we haven't seen yet! 3. Read a book \nAll of us have a long list of books we haven't read yet! 4. Have a house party \nDay 1: Party \nDay 3: Rest You're welcome 5. Try a new exercise \nWhy not? 6. Hit the mall \nSince everybody will have escaped for the long weekend, the malls will be pretty much empty, and you can browse through all those pretty things at leisure. 7. Explore your own city \nDo you know the city you live in well enough? If not, now if the time to see all the things you haven't yet. 8. Spend it with your family \nBecause we just don't spend enough time with our families anymore.
