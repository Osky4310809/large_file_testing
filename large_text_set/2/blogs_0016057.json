How we miss thee…or do we? \nIf you came of drinking age (or perhaps not quite) during the 1990s, you probably downed a bottle or two of the clear malt drink that was marketed as not beer, not wine, but simply a “unique alcohol beverage.” Whether or not you kept it down is a different story. \nThough it was officially off shelves by 2008, the internet is now abuzz with the possibility that it will be making a comeback in the near future. The drink will “allegedly be offered for a limited time only,” AdAge reports , citing Beer Business Daily.

When you’re in a ’90s dystopian bar where they only serve Zima so you’re just like, “sure.” \n4. When you’re low-key being attacked by bees and the only known cure is Zima. \n5. When your Zima chills you out so hard that your mouth sticks to the aluminum pole that is for some reason positioned at the bar during a grunge concert. \nFor more food and beverage news, follow People Food on Facebook.
