Durkin | 7:09 am, February 13th, 2017 \nThe hosts of MSNBC’s Morning Joe continued their blistering attacks against Stephen Miller , the senior advisor to President Donald Trump , just one day after the political aide represented the White House on the Sunday talk shows . \nAnd despite the fact that Miller’s performance earned favor with the President himself, Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough were flabbergasted at Miller’s combative rhetoric against the judiciary. \n“It’s so much worse than I thought,” said Brzezinski, who used her own Twitter account late Sunday to promote the hashtag #MillerTime2Go. \nScarborough, who previously ripped into Miller for his role in advising the executive orders on immigration , continued his brash language Monday morning. “[The President’s decisions] will be questioned my young, little Miller. They will be questioned by the Court. It’s called judicial review. Alexander Hamilton and James Madison wrote about it in the Federalist Papers . It was enshrined in Madison’s Constitution.” \n“That was the worst performance out of anybody,” Scarborough continued. “That was horrendous. An embarrassment.” \nOn Sunday, Miller defended the President’s use of executive order, going as far as to criticize judges who dared stand in the way of the law and order Presidency. “We do not have judicial supremacy in this country,” Miller said to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday . “ We have three co-equal branches of government .” \nTo make matters worse, Brzezinski pointed out on the Morning Joe panel Monday, “They love him. They love this guy.” \nAnd what would happen if Miller’s assertions were actually acted upon by the administration? “We would have impeachment proceedings within the next six months. Donald Trump would be impeached,” added Scarborough sharply. \n“There are some anti-Constitutional forces in that White House,” the Morning Joe co-host continued.
