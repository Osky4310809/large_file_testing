We know of so many stars who were super cute and chubby when they were young, and now have the body to die for. Such as actor Tiger Shroff, who recently made his debut on the Koffee With Karan couch with father, Jackie Shroff. Tiger was not always this fit and perfect. His sister, Krishna Shroff, recently shared an old picture of her and Tiger from when they were kids. Both of them look super cute in this adorable snap. See it for yourself.
