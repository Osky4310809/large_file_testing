The Twin Peaks page is May, with the first box in the calendar's grid -- Sunday, April 30 -- filled with the recognizable \"Welcome to Twin Peaks\" sign from the show's opening credits. (Photo: Showtime) \nThat's led WTTP to speculate that the series could premiere on April 30 or sometime in May, and lots of other sites have jumped on the bandwagon. \nIt's not an unreasonable assumption: Showtime chief David Nevins has said he hoped to debut the next installments of Twin Peaks in the first half of 2017, and it's likely that the network's Sunday night hit Homeland will wrap its season sometime in April. Placing something like Twin Peaks , which is expected to be a big hit for the network, into an already-successful time slot could be a way of Showtime helping it match expectations. \nThat said, basing a specific date on something on a calendar is pretty flimsy. Promotional calendars from comic book publishers, movie studios, and TV networks will often try to fit high-profile releases into the \"right\" month on the calendar, but it's hardly exact science. In particular, the idea that the network should fill the only \"empty\" day in the calendar's first week with a piece of key art hardly seems like a smoking gun. \nComplicating matters are a few other pieces of rumor and conjection that have cropped up this week: fans started wondering about the release date after series star Sherilynn Fell tweeted an image from Twin Peaks with the message that it's \"happening again\" and \"sooner than you think.\" \nIt's happening again this year....sooner than you think.... pic.twitter.com/CgEazhx8JQ — sherilynfenn (@sherilynfenn1) January 1, 2017 \nThat coincided not only with that calendar speculation, but a rumor that there would be a screening of at least one Twin Peaks episode at the Sundance Film Festival later this month. Co-creator and executive producer Mark Frost tweeted a denial of the Sundance rumors, but declined to address the scheduling question. \nTwin Peaks is written and produced by series creators and executive producers David Lynch and Mark Frost and is directed entirely by David Lynch. \nTwin Peaks returns as a limited series to Showtime in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:14:31.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
