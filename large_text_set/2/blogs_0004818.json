During the Chattanooga Women's March in Tennessee on Jan. 21, 2017. (Photo: Doug Strickland, AP) 10 CONNECT 26 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLetter to the editor: \nI live in California, I’m a heterosexual white male, and I wear a bright red hat that really infuriates people. \nMy hat has a patriotic phrase on the front: “Make America Great Again,” but from the looks I get, you’d think it was some sort of communist propaganda. Contrary to the belief of those who see me wear it, I am not a racist, sexist, or bigot. In fact, the ones who get the most upset upon seeing my hat are probably bigots themselves — my beliefs are different, and that really seems to grind their gears. \nWearing the hat is my way of protesting the politically correct movement that’s successfully turning half of the U.S. into pansies. It’s my jab at all the liberals who claim to be tolerant, yet seem to be very intolerant of my hat (and my views). It’s my attempt to expose the hypocrisy of some of those on the left who think I’m deplorable for donning such an accessory. \nThe truth is, I’m sick of the politically correct nonsense. I’m sick of seeing people shamed into silence. My hat is my counterattack. It’s me refusing to change my wardrobe because people are offended. I love American values and the freedom we enjoy — to say what I want to say, believe what I want to believe and wear what I want to wear — and I won’t let the ill-feelings of others scare me into submission. \nAre you offended by the hat I wear? Your answer might say more about you than it does about me. \nNoah Peterson; Santa Clarita, Calif. Policing the USA \nFacebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar: \nLet’s let the man whom we elected do his job. Even if you did not vote for him, the American way is to respect who is in office. Let President Trump do his job. His tactics may be too harsh for some, but he is doing all he talked about during his campaign. \n— Sylvia L.
