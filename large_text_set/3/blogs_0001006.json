Take his age out of it, it’s what he has achieved this season and what he has done. \n“We played against United on the first day of the season I was very impressed by him. He took his goal well and he has gone on to prove how good he is.

The Cherries have been sliding towards the relegation zone (Photo: Reuters) \n“Even in interviews after you can see how he is built to achieve the success he has. I’m appreciating him on a football level. “ \nBournemouth are only four points above the bottom three after failing to win since December. \nBut Howe, who masterminded their amazing rise from League Two to the Premier League, said: “I do see Bournemouth in the Premier League next season, our destiny is in our own hands.” poll loading Will Manchester United beat Bournemouth on Saturday? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:46:14.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
