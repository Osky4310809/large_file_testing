It was sad to say goodbye to him this week as he left us for stud in Bahrain but we're sure that Proconsul will prove to be a worthy replacement.\" \nProconsul - who ran twice for Andre Fabre in France without reaching the frame - is the fifth son of his Listed-winning dam Kind to stand as a stallion. \nFrankel needs no introduction as his first crop of two-year-olds were the subject of intense scrutiny last year. Noble Mission stands at Lane's End Stud in Kentucky, while their three-parts brother Bullet Train plies his trade at Crestwood Farm in Kentucky. \nMorpheus, that trio's half-brother by Oasis Dream, resides at Tally-Ho Stud in County Westmeath.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:10:59.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
