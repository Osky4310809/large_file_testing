A brand like TVF has always focused on entertaining us was one of the most popular on social media. The blog that alleged severe molestation charges against Arunabh Kumar paved way for several other women to come out and speak about similar encounters. \nScreenshot of the medium blog \n(Also read: TVF Founder Arunabh Kumar Denies Allegations, Says He Is Open To Receiving Police Complaint) \nThe statement that was earlier pushed out by TVF's team was not just weak but it also received a lot of flak for being too emotional. Many claimed that it was a threatening and over-confident post that didn't have any of their facts in place. So, after days of its first response, TVF sent out another modified response. \nTVF Accepting its flawed first response, the team admitted that it should have responded in a better manner rather than reacting emotionally and too quickly. However, it also made a point that whoever first levelled allegations against Kumar in a blog post, was never on its payroll. In its second statement, TVF wrote, \nThank you for reaching out to us. \nIt's been a tough couple of days for us at TVF, as you would know. We needed to first & foremost take care of our internal team that has been most impacted by the recent events. \nYes, there have been allegations of misbehavior against our Founder, from several women. When the first blog appeared on March 12th, it shocked all of us including our extended set of associates. The allegations were severe. We were confused & taken aback. \nThe blog alleged that he/she was an employee with the organization & even indicated specific content production they were a part of. We immediately began checking the facts internally. \nWe did send out an instant response, which may have been a bit too quick & emotional. We recognize that we should have handled that response better. However, it is a fact that we have found no records of any such person on our payroll, in that given time period, as described in the blog. \nEven as we were dealing with the first episode, several other allegations surfaced soon thereafter. Please know that we are sincerely looking into each one of them. We are committed to getting to the bottom of these allegations. Many of you have asked so we would like to confirm that yes, we have an ICC Committee set up in each location. \nWe as a team of 240 strong professionals are determined to work hard in winning your love back. We will do everything in our capacity to learn & get better, get bigger. Give us that chance.
