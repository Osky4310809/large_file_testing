Julie Muncy Culture   4:15 pm. 4:15 pm Yes, Overwatch Was One of Pornhub’s Biggest Searches in 2016 Activision Blizzard \nPornhub released its year-in-review viewing statistics today, and as usual it’s a fascinating glimpse into a (humongous) corner of internet usage that isn’t discussed much in polite conversation. Besides the fact that “VR” was the fastest-growing search in just about every country, one detail in particular caught our eye: the 11th most popular search term in the world last year was our Game of the Year , multiplayer shooter Overwatch . To which you may be asking yourself: Wait, what ? \nIn truth, it’s not that surprising for anyone familiar with the game. Overwatch is, well, horny; it has a wide, colorful cast of largely attractive characters, many of whom are sexualized in ways ranging from the explicit to the more subtle . (Both of those links are safe for work. Scout’s honor.) It’s something the game’s fandom has run with in a big way, too; a quick search of the Overwatch tag on Tumblr or any site like it reveals an unending stream of fan art, much of it depicting every possible relationship configuration you can imagine. And the cast coming from a wide variety of geographical and cultural backgrounds is apparently paying off in the porn scene: While the game doesn’t crack the top 10 search terms globally, it’s third in Spain, second in Argentina, and the top Pornhub search term for all of 2016 in Russia. (That last one probably isn’t a coincidence. Zarya, a pink-haired heavy who many in the fandom read as a butch lesbian, is from Russia in the game’s backstory and seems to have quite the following there.) \nThe cast of characters is broad enough to cater to a lot of different prurient interests, from the traditional to German proto-viking warriors to, uh, robots who can turn into stationary turrets. Games encourage you to identify with the characters you play as , and a game like Overwatch in particular encourages you to select, learn, and master specific characters. It’s only natural that those connections might extend to other parts of life. If anything, it’s surprising that sexy videogame interpretations haven’t hit the mainstream sooner. Then again, if any game from last year was poised to take the NSFW world by storm, we’re just glad it was one that was designed to be as inclusive and harassment-free as possible, rather than, like, Doom .
