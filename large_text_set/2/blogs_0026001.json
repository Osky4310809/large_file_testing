And, now, the actor is working towards another life goal he has - climbing the Mount Everest. Yes, you read that right. Amit has had a love for trekking and mountaineering since he was all of six-years-old. And the Mount Everest is the ultimate destination. But it's no easy feat. He is currently on a crazy training schedule, to prepare himself for the expedition, doing Pilates to strengthen his core, and Yoga for breathing techniques and altitude training. He is aiming to make the climb in 2019, and has also taken six months off work for the same. About the process, he says, \"A lot of permissions have to be taken and it's not easy to climb Everest. About Rs 35 lakh will be needed for this and, currently, I am in the process of figuring out the logistics. I am also locking the team that I am going to be climbing with\". He is also taking off four months in 2018 to climb Mount Annapurna, which happens to be the tenth highest mountain on the planet before Mount Everest, possibly as preparation. We wish him best of luck with this dream of his, and we'll definitely be cheering him on from down here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:25:07.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
