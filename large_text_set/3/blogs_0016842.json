I’m not interested in summaries, I can’t deal with anonymous sources . I need witnesses, I need facts, and I need evidence.” \nHe went on to state later that focus needs to be put less on the witch hunt for which no evidence actually exists, and more on the fact that a “ small universe ” of people are leaking classified information and further threatening American national security . \n“It’s a small universe of people who would have had access to the underlying conversation, any summaries, and then what ultimately ended up in The Washington Post,” Gowdy said. “You’re not talking about 300 million people . You might be talking about 30. So you need to find those 30 and apply whatever pressure is necessary from a legal standpoint through your investigation, because leaks are going to destroy these programs.” \nThe liberal Obama-lovers can continue to spew stories from anonymous sources, but nothing is going to change the fact that the House Intelligence Committee is still going to operate within the parameters of verifiable evidence. Don’t expect to hear this on mainstream media.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:13:11.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
