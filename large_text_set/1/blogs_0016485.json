By Tom Phillips Published 17/01/2017 \nBrexit has already hit Toblerone and Terry's Chocolate Orange, but now its effects are about to really hit home. \nApple has today notified app developers of an incoming 25 per cent price hike for the UK App Store, which will see its default 79p price tag raised to 99p. \nWhile 99p is still a small fee, this price change is a sizeable increase - and double the 10p raise seen on the App Store previously. \nIt will also be the first time UK pricing is now identical to the US. 99 cents on the App Store will now equate 99p. \nHigher prices will change accordingly - so £7.99 will become £9.99. Unless Nintendo chooses to drop its price, this means Super Mario Run's unlock fee will rise by £2. \n\"When foreign exchange rates or taxation changes, we sometimes need to update prices on the App Store,\" Apple told developers in an email this morning, as seen by The Guardian . \nCustomers will begin to see pricing change over the next seven days. \nApple has already raised the cost of its Mac hardware in response to Brexit. iPhone 7 is also more expensive in the UK as a result , too. \nIt's not just Apple, either. HTC Vive got a price hike last August . Brexit has also been blamed in part for contributing to Nintendo Switch's £280 launch price.
