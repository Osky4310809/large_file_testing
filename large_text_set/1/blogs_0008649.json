I don’t know how these exotic car tours turn out but hopefully he had all his waivers in order because the Reddit thread Jalopnik referenced says his insurance estimated about $270,000 worth of damage to the car . And it probably goes without saying but that’s a st p price to pay for a guy almost sending a high-priced sports car flying off a mountain because he’s trying to show off for the Bart Simpson-voiced gal in the car with him. But overall that’s a lesson that guys like this need to learn. A Ferrari like this goes well beyond being some gearhead dude who knows a little about cars and can fake his way through a conversation with people who know things with only some eye rolls. You’re dealing with some serious technology here that could send you soaring off a cliff like Thelma and Louise and hurt yourself and others on the road, it’s not a place to be a tough dude thinking he can hang corners at 90 miles an hour. Sometimes in life you’re a Mario Kart 50CC guy. No shame in that. \nAlso love car hardo burns: \nNote: He is referring to a type of Subaru car and not a sexually transmitted infection. Now we don’t both have to Google that. Chris Spags |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:19:48.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
