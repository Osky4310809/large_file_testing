Full report will be on the way shortly. pic.twitter.com/9VkV7R3vud \n— Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) March 21, 2017 \nOne security vulnerability, described in detail by Ormandy here , not only allows an attacker to steal passwords, but — in certain circumstances — it can also be used to run arbitrary code on the victim's computer. \nOn Tuesday, LastPass announced that particular issue was resolved. But on Wednesday, the company acknowledged that there is an unpatched bug in its Firefox add-on. \nThe issue reported by Tavis Ormandy has been resolved. We will provide additional details on our blog soon.\n— LastPass (@LastPass) March 21, 2017 \nWe are aware of reports of a Firefox add-on vulnerability. Our security is investigating and working on issuing a fix.\n— LastPass (@LastPass) March 22, 2017 \nLastPass said users don't need to do anything at this point. But the company still hasn't published anything on its official blog regarding these new security holes. \nWhile no software is safe from security holes, vulnerabilities that affect password managers such as LastPass are particularly worrisome, as these services safeguard users' entire password collections. It's sort of like a skeleton key for your personal data. \nThis is not the first serious security issue LastPass has encountered. The service got hacked in 2011 and again in June 2015 . And in 2013 , a bug caused some users' Internet Explorer passwords to get exposed to the public. \nLastPass did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nWATCH: This automatic smart lock is both convenient and secure", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:11:09.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
