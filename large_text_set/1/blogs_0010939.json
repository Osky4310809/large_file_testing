The Vice President said he had “no inkling” he would be presented with the award.\n“You got right the part about my leaning on Jill, but I’ve also leaned on you and a lot of people in this room,” Biden said. “I get a lot of credit I don’t deserve, to state the obvious. I’ve always had someone to lean on.”\nOf the president, Biden said, “this is a remarkable man.”\n“This honor is not only well beyond what I deserve but it is a reflection of the extent and generosity of your spirit,” Biden said. “I don’t deserve this but I know it came from the president’s heart.”\nBoth the President’s and the Vice President’s speeches were filled with lighthearted moments and actual emotion.\nAside from presenting the president with an opportunity to honor his veep, Obama joked that the event also “gives the internet one last chance to talk about our bromance.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:13:48.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
