Even Democrats support this by a [48 percent to 43 percent] margin. Additionally, respondents disagree with the Democratic claim that if Republicans repeal ACA that it will make America sick again.\" \nThe poll was conducted Jan. 3-5 by Greg Strimple and Brooks Kochbar of GS Strategy Group. The self-identified political affiliation of the respondents broke down as 36.4 percent Democrat; 34.5 percent Republican; 24.2 percent independent. The margin of error was 3.1 percentage points.

It's a play on President-elect Trump's campaign slogan: \"Make America Great Again.\" Trump has promised to sign repeal legislation that is coupled with an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, President Obama 's signature healthcare overhaul law. \nPartisan polls can offer a distorted view of voter sentiment. The questions, and the wording of the questions, can be designed to produce a desired outcome. So it's possible that a Democratic poll could reveal competing concerns and reaction to the Republicans' plans for junking Obamacare and replacing it with something new. \nHere are some of the survey's findings: 54.1 percent favor complete repeal or major changes to Obamacare, including 61.6 percent of Independents and 17.6 percent of Democrats. The closest margins for repeal/major changes versus minor tweaks or doing nothing are among women and Millennials, who favor repeal by 1.7 points and 1.4 points, respectively. At 44.4 percent, the No. 1 reason respondents gave for opposing Obamacare was that it is too expensive or that it has increased the cost of health care. At 21.8 percent, cost was the No. 1 concern respondents had about the law. The federal mandate for purchasing insurance is the No. 2 concern, at 16.4 percent. \nDespite Obamacare's continued unpopularity, Democrats might be encouraged by some of the poll's findings heading into the battle in Congress over repeal of the law. Among them: Also from the Washington Examiner Parade announcer on being dumped by Trump: 'I thought I was going to commit suicide' \nThe 89-year-old man who has announced every presidential inaugural parade since President Dwight Eisenhower's second term in 1957 is \"traumatized\" after President-elect Trump decided to replace him. \n\"I looked at my email, then I got the shock of my life,\" Charles Brotman told CNN on Monday. \"I felt like Muhammad Ali had hit me in the stomach.\" \nHe is being replaced by Steve Ray, a freelance announcer in Washington, D.C. \n\"I thought I was going to commit suicide,\" Brotman said about the email he received from Trump's transition team on Thursday. \n\"It was really terrible. I know that I've been doing it for 60 years and nobody has ever asked whether I'm a Democrat, Republican, independent. â€¢ 01/09/17 5:20 PM Support for repeal and replace is based on there being a \"realistic, modest transition period to get the new system up and running, letting people keep their coverage while they wait for the new law to be in place.\" In other words, as long as Republicans avoid the disruptions that accompanied the implementation of Obamacare, voters would support it by a margin of 68.9 percent to 25.2 percent. Support for some of the core components of the Affordable Care Act, including prohibitions against refusing coverage based on a pre-existing medical condition and allowing parents to keep their children on their insurance until they reach age 26. Those policies are supported by 92.2 percent and 78.8 percent of respondents overall.
