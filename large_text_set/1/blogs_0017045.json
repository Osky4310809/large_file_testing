She was a straight antagonist in the original film, but in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , there is going to be more of an arc for the character. \nIn a recent interview with The Wrap , Nebula actress Karen Gillan shared her excitement about the newest entry in the series, and how it might get some fans to look at the character a bit differently. \n“What I love about the second movie for Nebula in particular is that we get — We know that she’s a pretty angry woman with some daddy issues. [But] in the second movie, we’re going to start to see how much pain her father actually caused her, and we’re going to delve right into the relationship with her sister Gamora,” the actress told TheWrap of what Marvel fans can expect in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.”. \n“I think we might even feel a tinge of sympathy towards Nebula this time, because we really start to see the emotional crack in her character,” she added. “I was just allowed to completely explore that and take it to a completely different dimension with her. I was really happy about that.” \nIn the first trailer, it looks like Nebular is either kidnapped or smuggled out of a secret location, and she seems to be working with the Guardians as opposed to against them this time around. How that came to be remains to be seen, but the character has not had an easy life, and villains like her are always more interesting when you at least have a general understanding of where they are coming from. Showing how she got here will go a long way to making the character even better in the sequel. \nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos. The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill’s true parentage. Old foes become new allies and fan-favorite characters from the classic comics will come to our heroes’ aid as the Marvel cinematic universe continues to expand. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is written and directed by James Gunn (Slither). The film marks the return of the original Guardians, including Chris Pratt (Jurassic World) as Peter Quill/Star-Lord; Zoe Saldana (Star Trek Into Darkness) as Gamora; Dave Bautista (Spectre) as Drax; Vin Diesel (Furious 7) as the voice of Groot; Bradley Cooper (American Sniper) as the voice of Rocket; Michael Rooker (Jumper) as Yondu; Karen Gillan (The Big Short) as Nebula ; and Sean Gunn (Gilmore Girls) as Kraglin. New cast members include Pom Klementieff (Oldboy), Elizabeth Debicki (The Great Gatsby, Everest), Chris Sullivan (The Knick, The Drop) and Kurt Russell (The Hateful Eight, The Thing). \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is scheduled to hit theaters on May 5, 2017.
