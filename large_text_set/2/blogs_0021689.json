That's according to The Sun 's Martin Blackburn , who added that City boss Pep Guardiola is a known admirer of the defender's and attempted to sign him last summer, while Chelsea manager Antonio Conte worked with him at Juve and later as Italy coach. The centre-back rowed with Allegri on camera during Friday's 4-1 win over Palermo and was punished for the incident by being left out of Wednesday's UEFA Champions League tie with Porto. However, the pair have now made up. Allegri told Sky Sports (h/t GianlucaDiMarzio.com ): \" It's a shame that we had the incident on Friday. These are things that happen during the season, I'll go as far as thanking him for raising the emotional tension. But Leo has apologised, and everything has been resolved.\" Indeed, Bleacher Report UK's Adam Digby does not believe the row will have an impact on Bonucci's future at the club: Adam Digby @Adz77 Sure this will lead to speculation about the futures of @OfficialAllegri & @bonucci_leo19 but for me its no different to Pogba/Conte in 2013 Juventus went on to beat Porto 2-0 away from home. Nevertheless, BeIN Sports' Matteo Bonetti and Fox Sports' Aaron West believed him to be a significant loss: Matteo Bonetti @TheCalcioGuy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:26:54.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
