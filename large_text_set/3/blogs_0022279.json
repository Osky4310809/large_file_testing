Efron plays Matt Brody, a gold medal-winning swimmer who wants to join the “Avengers of the beach,” but Johnson’s Mitch Buchanan isn’t having any of it. In the end, he’s forced to enlist Matt for a mission to stop Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra), who’s leaving a trail of drugs and dead bodies.\nCheck out the official trailer above, and the previous teasers below.\n\n\n\nIn other movie news, Microsoft is releasing a military-inspired Xbox controller .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:26:49.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
