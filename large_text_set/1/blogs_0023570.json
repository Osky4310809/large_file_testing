They said they killed Parker because he was a pedophile, while his wife was a “casualty of war,” according to the  Daily Mail .\nWhile the Moodys had initially acted repentant and asked for a 30-year sentence, they showed their true colors when the maximum sentence was handed down in the Union County, North Carolina courtroom Tuesday.\n“See you perverts later,” Jeremy Moody shouted at Charles Parker's family as he exited the courtroom. '”That's what child molesters get.”\n“They got exactly what they deserve,” he told a reporter. “Had to do it over again, I'd kill more.”\nHis wife seconded that sentiment.\n“I think Jeremy and I would have done it again if given the opportunity,” Christine Moody said to reporters. “I have no regrets. Killing that pedophile was the best day of my life.”\nThe couple  killed the Parkers  in July 2013, pretending they were having car trouble outside their residence and then ushering them inside with a gun, according to Union County Sheriff David Taylor. Jeremy Moody shot them both, making it clear that he was doing so because Marvin Parker was a registered sex offender, while Christine Moody slit Dawn Parker’s throat. It wasn’t long before they were apprehended—a surveillance camera on the property caught Jeremy Moody’s “skinhead” tattoo.\nWhile the Moodys are self-professed white supremacists, they claim that the murders were not committed in connection to a group. That said, they do reportedly have personal connections to Crew 41, a white supremacist group that has a history of killing sex offenders, according to the  Southern Poverty Law Center .\nThe defendants’ lawyers said that both Moodys were sexually abused as children, and so targeted the same type of offender who had wronged them. Attorneys also said that Jeremy Moody is medicated for schizophrenia and was not on his medicine at the time of the murders, while Christine Moody has cancer, as well as a host of personality and stress disorders.\n“He was on his medicine today and look what he had to say,” said prosecutor Kevin Brackett at the trial.\n\nSources:  Daily Mail ,  Fox Carolina \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T01:42:51.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
