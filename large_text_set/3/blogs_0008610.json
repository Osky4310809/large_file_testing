Ms. Story, 48, a jewelry designer and an adjunct professor at New York University and the Fashion Institute of Technology, makes enough money from hourly rentals that she was able to reduce her teaching load. She rented out her three-story East Village townhouse about 20 times over the last year on Splacer and Peerspace, charging users $173 an hour. Facebook and Etsy have held company retreats in her living room, which has an exposed brick wall and a floating staircase. The space has also been used for wedding receptions, baby showers and photo shoots. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story On a good month, Andrew Matusik , 47, a fashion photographer who owns a 1,600-square-foot loft on Park Avenue South , makes $11,000 through Splacer, more than enough to pay the $8,000-a-month mortgage on his $900,000 apartment. He charges renters, mostly film and photography crews, about $1,800 a day to use his studio space with vaulted, 13½-foot ceilings and oversize windows. Mr. Matusik spends six to 10 hours a week coordinating rentals. His guests have included Absolut vodka and the VH1 show “Love & Hip Hop.” While Mr. Matusik does not mind strangers overtaking his apartment twice a week, his wife, Sunni Spencer, 42, is less enthusiastic. The couple married in 2015, about a year after Mr. Matusik started the endeavor. The couple sleeps in the mezzanine level of the loft on a Murphy bed. “For the first year of marriage, it was difficult,” he said. Ms. Spencer, a brand adviser, had trouble adjusting to the endless stream of visitors in an apartment with an open floor plan that leaves little room for privacy. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Not all parties go as planned. About a year ago, Ms. Story walked in the door of her townhouse at midnight to find that a party that was supposed to end at 10 p.m. was still going strong. Added to that, about 70 people were in her home, well over the 30-guest limit. “I was like, ‘What’s going on?’” Ms. Story recalled. “They were supposed to be in the cleanup phase. The guy gave me an attitude.” The bathroom was flooded. Ms. Story insisted that the group pay for a maid service. All three companies provide liability insurance, and hosts can request that their guests leave a security deposit. While many hosts have renters or homeowners insurance , a residential policy may not cover damage from a commercial use. Corporate guests generally have insurance, too. Still, cleaning up a mess takes time. In Bushwick, Brooklyn , Cristina Puron spent two days refinishing the floor of her 1,200-square- foot loft after a dance troupe destroyed the varnish and cracked the wood with their shoes. But the incident did not deter Ms. Puron, 27, from listing her rental apartment again. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story She lists the space, with a hammock and a rope swing hanging in the living room, on all three sites for around $100 an hour. As for the potential for mishaps, she said: “It’s a risk that you have to take when you do this.” A version of this article appears in print on March 12, 2017, on Page RE4 of the New York edition with the headline: Renting Your Home as an Event Space.
