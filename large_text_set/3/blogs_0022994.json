A 10,000-year-old geothermal spring at the Homestead Resort in Midway, UT, has become a popular attraction for its warm mineral waters and unique dome shape. Its beehive-like limestone walls reach 55 feet above the crystal-clear pool narrowing at its opening. \nThe Homestead Crater was a result of melting snow on the Wasatch Mountains that seeped two miles below the ground. The earth's interior naturally heated the water, which eventually deposited minerals to the surface forming its volcano shape. The water always maintains a temperature of 90 to 96 degrees Fahrenheit. \nVisitors are required to make reservations prior to arriving ($16 for a soak) and are allowed to swim, scuba dive, snorkel, soak, or enjoy a paddle board yoga class. If you're wondering whether you have to jump through the top to get in, you don't. The resort created a tunnel at ground level for entry, which takes you to their custom-built decks inside the crater. You can also check out the natural phenomenon without having to take a dip and take a tour instead. Check out some awesome photos ahead!
