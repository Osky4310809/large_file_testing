Beating sister and longtime rival Venus, Serena won her seventh Australian Open tournament. #23 is significant to many sports fans when talking about basketball for sure, but the number now has an added layer of meaning which Nike and Jordan Brand acknowledged.\nHaving been with the brand since 2004, Nike and Jordan Brand honored the occasion by releasing an exclusive Air Jordan 1, Williams’ favorite sneaker. Williams also happened to changed into a pair of the sneakers for the title ceremony. Alongside the Air Jordan 1, Nike also released a limited edition of the women’s NikeCourt Flare. The exclusive AJ1s come in Williams’ favorite colors pink and black, while the NikeCourt Flare comes in both red/black and pink/black colorways.\nIt’s fair to say that when it comes to a conversation regarding the greatest athletes of all time, Serena Williams is in the same bracket as Michael Jordan, Muhammad Ali and Lionel Messi.\nThe SW x Air Jordan footwear collection launches January 28 in selected Nike stores. Both colorways of the women’s NikeCourt Flare AJ1 release January 30 on SNKRS in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan. The Girls’ Air Jordan 1 Retro High SW is available January 30 in the U.S. only.\n\nIn other news, John Boyega will be starring in a new Netflix original film titled Imperial Dreams, available to stream on February 3.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T18:50:07.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
