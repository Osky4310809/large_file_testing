(Representative Image) \nA day after a bomb was hurled at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) office in Kallachy, there has been another incident reported today. The latest development is that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) office was set on fire last night at Vishnumangalam by some unidentified people. While no casualties have been reported, this has triggered a fresh round of political allegations between parties across the state. Despite the fact that the Kerala Budget had to be presented today, the atmosphere of tension was apparent since early morning. \nYesterday’s attack at the RSS office saw three RSS workers who were injured and had to be rushed the Government Medical College in Kozhikode. According to local channels, the immediate reason for triggering this attack may have been related to reports of an RSS leader from Madhya Pradesh who had offered one crore rupees to anyone who brought him Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s head. \nJ Nandakumar, All India Sah-Prachar Pramukh of the RSS, said, “The RSS does not endorse or support such statements. Despite several attacks on our RSS workers in Kerala, we have always stood by democratic means to respond to the increasing violence targeted against our cadres. RSS remains committed to a democratic way of functioning and we do not respond to violence or comments that provoke violence.” \nWatch this also: \nThis isn’t the first time that there have been attacks on CPM and RSS workers. On February 13th, a 20 year old BJP worker Nirmal had been stabbed to death and the BJP state unit had alleged that the CPM had masterminded it. \nWhy the political killings in Kerala have to stop right now \nFollowing the tensions and the possible attacks between both party workers after 20 year old RSS worker Nirmal’s death, CM Pinarayi Vijayan had called leaders of both parties to discuss their issues across the table and he had assured that peace is paramount for the state to progress. \nHowever, CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s ”discussion” has turned out to be a temporary measure as within weeks, a fresh round of attacks has begun yet again and the state administration has done nothing to take charge or rein in the situation.
