Ross 2017-03-05 05:51:15 UTC In the immortal words of Mr. Gump: “Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.”\nSo if you’re Octavia Spencer, you just might serve a very special kind of pie to Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions on Saturday Night Live . \nSpencer made an unusual host cameo in tonight’s cold open. She showed up as her Oscar-winning character from The Help , Minny, all to deliver a hot slice of “chocolate” pie to Kate McKinnon’s Sessions in a hilarious Forrest Gump send-up. \nFor those who haven’t been following recent events, the attorney general is in a spot of bother right now over meetings he had with the Russian ambassador. Meetings Sessions apparently failed to disclose during his Senate confirmation hearing. \n“This senator from up north started asking me all these questions about, Russia, if I ever talked to them,” McKinnon said, in her southern bumpkin Sessions drawl. “I got so nervous and confused I got about as worked up as a double-donged piggy in a room full of sows.” \nSo when the lie was uncovered, Sessions followed the advice of his lawyer to “Run Forrest, Run!” all the way to the bus stop. Unheeded, perhaps, was advice not to divulge anything more about potential meetings with the Russians. \n“I was the only one who talked to the Russians. Well, me and Michael Flynn,” McKinnon said. “So just me and Michael Flynn. And JD Gordon. So just me, Michael Flynn, and JD Gordon, and also Jared Kushner at Trump Tower. Me, Michael Flynn, and JD Gordon and Jared Kushner at Trump Tower. And Carter Page. And that’s all I got to say about that. And Paul Manafort.” \nWe’re pretty sure Spencer’s Minny didn’t meet with the Russians, but she did show up to give Sessions — the very Jeff Sessions Coretta Scott King wrote that damning letter about — a slice of humble pie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T12:44:56.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
