Even though she was nominated for an Oscar herself for her role as Jackie Kennedy in Jackie , Natalie also happened to be 9 months pregnant. It was the best decision for her , and now we’re learning that it was actually THE BEST decision: Natalie gave birth over a week ago, well before the Oscars.\nYup, sounds like a pretty good reason to skip the (memorable) 89th Academy Awards.\nAs People reports, Natalie and her husband, Benjamin Millepied, have only just revealed that they’ve welcomed their new little one into the world. Her name is Amalia, we bet she’s adorable, and she’s actually been in this world for almost a week and a half. According to People , Natalie actually gave birth on February 22nd — the Oscars took place four days later, on February 26th.\nJust before the Oscars, Natalie gave a statement to People explaining: “Due to my pregnancy, I am unable to attend the Independent Spirit Awards and the Academy Awards. I feel so lucky to be honored among my fellow nominees and wish them the most beautiful of weekends.”\nIt wasn’t just her pregnancy keeping her home, but her new little one, too. Yup, you bet if we had just given birth, we would have opted to stay home, too. Honestly, nothing sounds better than saying in with the family and watching TV together (we are assuming that the whole family gathered around the television to watch the Oscars’ telecast unfold on live TV).\nSending so much love and happiness to Natalie, Benjamin, new big brother Aleph, and lil’ Amalia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:17:15.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
