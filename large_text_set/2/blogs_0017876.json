And I'm not the person who has to answer that.\" \nCatalan newspaper Mundo Deportivo said the reaction of the fans at the weekend , rather than criticism for the Paris defeat, was the reason. Lionel Messi scored twice against Leganes but did not celebrate his second goal. \nLuis Enrique and Andre Gomes were among those whistled amid a tense atmosphere. \nMessi is in the final 18 months of his contract and his father, Jorge, is currently in Barcelona where he is reported to be negotiating a new deal with president Josep Maria Bartomeu. \nBartomeu has told supporters he is confident that an agreement can be reached. \nSamuel Marsden covers Barcelona for ESPN FC.
