For instance, Gerwig’s character Abbie discovers she has cervical cancer during a visit to Planned Parenthood, and another scene shows Fanning’s character Julie receiving her first prescription for birth control at the same facility.\nIn order to make sure the scenes were realistic, Planned Parenthood actually consulted on the film and Planned Parenthood California Central Coast shared information and resources about Planned Parenthood health centers in the ’70s. \n“The people at Planned Parenthood were so helpful to me with the writing and pre-production of 20th Century Women ,” Mills said in a statement. “They connected me with people who worked in PP offices in the ’70s to make sure every aspect of my scenes was correct, from the language counselors used to the very particular decor and dress of the people in those offices, to the overarching philosophy and attitude of the women who worked there. It was very important to me that we capture this moment in women’s reproductive rights accurately and they were so generous and helpful to me.” \n20th Century Women hits theaters nationwide on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T05:18:50.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
