A European Union flag besides a British flag outside Europe House in London. AP \nAnand Menon, a professor of European politics at King's College London university, said the relationship was always \"transactional\" and therefore the break-up is \"logical\". \"It's been a utilitarian relationship since 1973 and the emphasis was always on the economic dimension, not on the political one,\" said Pauline Schnapper, professor of contemporary British history at the Sorbonne University in Paris. \"The sentimental dimension is near-inexistent,\" she said. \nThe path towards the European Union began after World War II, as the shattered continent tried to rebuild and deepen integration as a way of bolstering the peace. The project did not immediately appeal to Britain. \n\"I think we didn't feel vulnerable enough to join, quite simply,\" Menon said. \nBritain preferred to focus on its special relationship with the US and the remains of its empire. London nevertheless supported the push for closer integration on the European continent: wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill called for the creation of a \"United States of Europe\" in his 1946 Zurich speech. \nBut in the early 1960s, Britain's fortunes changed for the worse. Its economic growth started lagging behind that of France and Germany, making the European single market on its doorstep seem an appealing option. \nBritain said on Monday it would begin the Brexit process on 29 March with a formal notification by letter to EU President Donald Tusk. Joining the European fray in the first place was not an easy task. \nIn 1961, France's then-president Charles de Gaulle vetoed Britain's first application, seeing it as a \"Trojan horse\" for the US and doubting Britain's European spirit. Another French veto followed in 1967 and the UK was only finally welcomed into the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973. \nUnfortunately for Britain, the first oil crisis struck that same year and so the much-hoped-for economic boost failed to materialise. Nevertheless, 67 percent of the British people voted to remain in the EEC in a 1975 referendum. \n\"The fact that we joined late is one of the reasons there are suspicions, because obviously there is a sense that we joined a club that others had set up to suit themselves,\" Menon said. \nBritain and the EEC soon locked horns and London began opting out of the major attempts to step up European integration. \nIn 1979, London refused to participate in the European monetary system, defending its national and fiscal sovereignty. \nSix years later, it refused to ratify the Schengen Agreement — abolishing internal border checks — and in 1993, it opted out of the European single currency. Britain's anti-federalist approach was spelled out by then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during a 1988 speech at the College of Europe in Bruges. In it, she rejected the idea of a \"European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels\". \nIn the 90s, Britain's defiance towards Brussels accelerated further with the creation of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which campaigned for the country's exit from the EU. The opposition party's successes, particularly in the 2014 European Parliament elections when it topped the polls, pushed the government to harden its rhetoric. \nThe Eurozone crisis, large-scale immigration from the EU, and the refugee crisis of the past few years stoked discontent, pushing Prime Minister David Cameron to call the June 2016 referendum. In the end, 52 percent of voters opted for Brexit. \nNeither side is likely to end up the happier after the divorce, said John Springford, director of research at the Centre for European Reform in London. \"I am not convinced that Britain leaving the EU will help Britain or help the EU,\" he said. \n 38  38 pm Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:31:46.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
