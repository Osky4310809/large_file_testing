(Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nSutton United FC, a fifth-tier English soccer club, incredibly reached the fifth round of the FA Cup and hosted Premier League power Arsenal at Gander Green Lane in South London on Monday. \nArsenal won, 2-0, but the biggest star of the match didn't even play. \nSutton's backup keeper is Wayne Shaw. The 46-year-old really made the most of this rare matchup with a Premier League club. He was seen vacuuming the dugouts before the match . \nBut even better, BBC's Chris Slegg spotted Shaw at the stadium bar during halftime. I kid you not.
