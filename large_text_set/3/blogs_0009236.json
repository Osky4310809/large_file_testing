Earlier Thursday, the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, of which Scalise is a member, moved the American Health Care Act forward. \nAlthough numerous objections to various portions of the bill have emerged since it was unveiled Monday, Scalise said that this week’s fast start and the Republican unity that has prevailed on the two panels are important to the eventual passage of the new health care plan.

This bill eviscerates Obamacare. pic.twitter.com/SUjnbgr9Gn \n— Rep. Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) March 10, 2017 \n“It was significant that we got this first step done in a very unified way. The committee was unified. There was no Republican infighting,” Scalise said. “It was fun to fight between philosophies, conservatives and liberals, and that’s what happened for 27-and-a-half hours.” Advertisement - story continues below \nHe said that when the vote came and the measure passed, it was easy to see that a landmark event had just occurred. \n“If you look at the Democratic faces on the committee after 27-and-a-half hours,” he said, “you recognize just how powerful this moment is.” \n“Today you saw very clear lines because that’s what’s at stake. This bill truly does eviscerate Obamacare. Every Democrat knew that. You could look at their faces. They knew we were about to eviscerate Barack Obama ’s signature achievement.” \nScalise’s job as majority whip is to know the majority has the votes to pass legislation and to continue working with Republicans to keep them on track. Scalise noted that President Donald Trump has been a major asset in his work.

He wants this bill on his desk,” said Scalise. “He’s been very hands-on and it’s been very helpful.” \nScalise is also supported by Vice President Mike Pence, a former congressman, who on Thursday replied to a question about the health care bill by proclaiming, “Steady progress!” \nAlthough Republicans have targeted several points of the proposal upon which they disagree, Scalise estimated “85 percent” of the bill has the full support of the House majority. \n“Most of our members recognize this bill guts Obamacare and starts the whole process of completely repealing and replacing Obamacare. Keep in mind, this gets rid of the mandate penalties,” he said Friday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe . \n“It starts to open a free market where consumers can buy their own health care insurance. That’s at the heart of failures of Obamacare,” he said. \nScalise knows his job may get tougher next week when the Congressional Budget Office releases what’s called a “score” for the bill, estimating how many Americans might lose insurance under the new plan. Scalise does not project concern. \n“Over the years, CBO has been all over the board on health care. The only consistent point is they’ve missed the mark on different pieces,” he said. “That’s the nature of a scorekeeper.” \n“They are the only referee we can use, but it doesn’t mean they are infallible,” Scalise said. “We’re not going to let some un-elected bureaucrats in Washington stop us from moving forward with our agenda, but at the end of the day CBO is not the Holy Grail.” What do you think?
