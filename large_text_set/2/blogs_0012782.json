The former rebel, Haisam Omar Sakhanh, 46, was arrested last March in Karlskoga, Sweden, and charged with a crime against international law. According to prosecutors, Mr. Sakhanh was among a group of rebels who took part in the killings of the soldiers, in Idlib Province in northwestern Syria, in 2012. A former rebel, horrified by the atrocities, provided a video of the killings to The New York Times, which revealed them in September 2013. To justify the prosecution of an international law violation in Sweden — a country that had nothing to do with the killings — the prosecutors extensively researched the conditions of the civil war in Syria, and in particular in Idlib. “We had to put the criminal act in its right context in order to determine that it is a war crime and not just seven cases of murder,” Henrik Attorp, a senior public prosecutor, said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story He cited “very good cooperation with various countries,” and said that prosecutors had found additional evidence online, including a video taken shortly before the killings in which the rebels posed with the prisoners and explained where they had been seized. The rebels called themselves the Suleiman Soldiers. The man whom prosecutors identified as Mr. Sakhanh was wearing a neat brown jacket and appeared to be joking around. He was holding a Kalashnikov rifle, with which he shot a man at his feet. “We also found information on YouTube and Facebook that specified the time and place where they were captured,” Mr. Attorp said. “We were able to show how little time passed between the capture and execution of the prisoners. Some of the information was posted by the Suleiman Soldiers themselves. There was only 41 hours between their being taken captive in one location and brought to another village and executed. There wasn’t any form of quasi-judicial procedure or due process. And that’s why they found him guilty.” Italian officials also participated in the case. Mr. Sakhanh lived for some time in a town near Milan, and was arrested in February 2012 after participating in an occupation of the Syrian Embassy in Rome. He fled Italy and joined rebels in Syria . Maurizio Romanelli, the prosecutor in Milan, who oversaw an investigation after Mr. Sakhanh took part in an attack on Syrians living in the Lombardy region of Italy, said there had been a productive collaboration between the Swedish and Italian authorities.
