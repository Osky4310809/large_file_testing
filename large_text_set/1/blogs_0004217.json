Because we live in a society where you are grabbed, molested and then left to suffer by men, who also never do seem to get arrested. This is okay ... because you asked for it, right? You always do ask for it and then you cry when you do get it. That's the logic plain and simple. \nAnd you don't need us to tell you how flawed that logic is. Or rather, how sick. \nRight after the horrific molestation in Bangalore, came two politicians who again (it's 2017 guys) went on to blame the usual - women, short dresses, western culture, mobile phones, high heels - but never the men who did it. It is never their fault is it? And thus spawned this brilliant gem called #NotAllMen which was a large group of men saying 'so what if you got raped? We didn't rape you, did we.' \nIt seems that we are nowhere near seeing this \"blame the victim\" culture ending anytime soon. When politician Abu Azmi made a disgraceful comment about the women in Bengaluru themselves asking for it we expected people to counterattack. And they did. \nSane people like Farhan Akhtar and Esha Gupta took to questioning this man. Women should not dress like westerners b'coz men dressed like westerners are molesters, says the man in the shirt. #oxy (deprived)morons ‚Äî Farhan Akhtar (@FarOutAkhtar) January 3, 2017 The only woman to blame here,n she probably would have blamed herself too,is the woman who unknowingly gave birth to a jerk like u#AbuAzmi ‚Äî Esha Gupta (@eshagupta2811) January 3, 2017 \nAzmi's son, Farhan (who just happens to married to Ayesha Takia, FYI) lashed out at them both, especially Esha who he believed had insulted his mother.
