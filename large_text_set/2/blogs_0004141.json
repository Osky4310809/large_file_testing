His opponent, Bermudez, is on the cusp of entering the featherweight title picture and a big win over a veteran like Jung will put the rest of the top five on notice. \nIn the co-main event, up-and-coming star Alexa Grasso battles Felice Herrig while strawweights Jessica Andrade and Angela Hill kick off the main card in what should be considered a No. 1 contender’s bout. \nThe action gets underway at 7PM/4PM ETPT on UFC Fight Pass before moving to FS1 at 8PM/5PM for more prelims action. The main card starts at 10PM/7PM sharp, also on FS1.
