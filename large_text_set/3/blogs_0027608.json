Cpl. Andre Dakis/US Marine Corps\nThe offensive to destroy ISIS in Syria took a big step forward recently with US military advisers, helicopters, and artillery helping position a force of about 500 soldiers near a strategic damn outside of Raqqa, ISIS's Syrian capital.\nThe US military, along with Kurdish forces and the multi-ethnic Syrian Democratic Foces rebel group, have moved to put a stranglehold on Raqqa with shelling, air support, and ground forces at the last route in and out of the city, according to a press release .\nOperation Inherent Resolve, the 68-nation mission to destroy ISIS, flew in fighters from the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed rebel group, behind enemy lines to a strategic dam.\n“It takes a special breed of warrior to pull of an airborne operation or air assault behind enemy lines,” Col. Joe Scrocca, a spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve told the Times .\n\"Seizing Tabqah Dam will isolate Raqqah from three sides and give the SDF the strategic advantage and launching point needed for the liberation of the city,\" said the release. But while the US says they're mainly backing local forces, they seem poised to take on a more active role with conventional forces fighting ISIS on the ground in Raqqa.\nThe Pentagon has been considering sending as many as 1,000 ground troops to help take back Raqqa from ISIS, which would signal a reversal of the Obama-era policy to fight ISIS via train and equip methods and airstrikes.\nThe coalition says they've conducted more than 300 airstrikes around Raqqa in the past month.\nSyrian Democratic Forces with their Syrian Arab Coalition fighters prepare for an offensive to liberate Tabqah Dam from ISIS Mar 22 in Syria pic.twitter.com/2Ho1SQYhL1\n— Inherent Resolve (@CJTFOIR) March 23, 2017 Raqqa, situated along the Euphrates river in the mostly barren Easter Syria has been ISIS' main Syrian stronghold since 2014.\nThe US, Inherent Resolve coalition partners, and local forces have been involved in a massive air and ground campaign to rid the country of the terrorist group while simultaneously carrying out similar operations in neighboring Iraq.\nISW\nSyria: Our partners have rolled back ISIS territorial gains to the East, North, & West of Raqqah, capturing over 7,400 sq km of territory.\n— OIR Spokesman (@OIRSpox) March 15, 2017 A spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSEE ALSO: Watch a US-led airstrike destroy part of ISIS' arsenal in the terror group's shrinking Iraqi stronghold NOW WATCH: Here's footage of the US military's new helicopter that'll cost as much as an F-35 Loading video...
