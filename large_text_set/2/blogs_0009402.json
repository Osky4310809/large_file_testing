For this singular reason including those I had earlier mentioned, I am not convinced that he would spring up for his trial. \n“In consequence, it is hereby ordered that the accused be remanded at the Federal Prisons, Koton-Karfe. Meanwhile, the case is adjourned to Feb. 22, for further mention”, he said. \nEarlier, the prosecuting counsel, Mohammed Abaji, said the accused and one Yusuf Abdulqudus, who is currently at large masterminded the bombing. \nAbaji said that the duo had planned to bomb the FM Station again and sent a text message to the station during a call-in programme through the station’s phone number. \n“We are coming to bomb the office by 4:00p.m.” \nThe prosecution said that the threat through the text message from the Amoto’s phone number 09068487387 was promptly reported to the State Security Service who traced the number and subsequently arrested him. \nThe prosecution said the case was particularly heinous as the April 27, 2015 bombing of the station claimed the lives of Sadiq Salami, Abdullahi Suleiman, Sufiyan Abu and Idris Onivehu Salawu. \nHe prayed the court to take cognisance of the offences of criminal conspiracy, culpable homicide and attempted culpable homicide, contrary to Sections 97(1), 221 and 229 of the Penal Code. \nCounsel to the accused, Habib Abbas, had earlier made oral application for the bail of the accused, but the court refused the oral application. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T15:00:25.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
