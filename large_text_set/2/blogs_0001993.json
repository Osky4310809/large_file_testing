I think that everyone should have a touch of Granny in them and that every child needs someone like Granny throughout their childhood. I have to qualify though that as much as I would love to know granny, I would not want her for a relative, unless I was seven (almost eight).The story centers upon two important characters with an eclectic ensemble cast. Our first character of primary importance is Elsa who is struggling to overcome her perceived differences from other children along with nightmares and a full bucket of fears. Granny is our second character of note. Granny is like no other Granny. Honestly, she is a kick…when you are reading about her. Again, tough for grownups to have as a relative! Granny is gifted with an unbounding imagination with which she cleverly helps Elsa accept herself and her life as it was given to her. Elsa is taken on a journey like none other where she learns that even if she is a little bit different that there is an incredible value in just being herself. I love this quote that comes from Elsa’s narrative:\"Elsa also loves treasure hunts, but not as much as Granny. No one in any kingdom in the eternity of ten thousand fairy tales could love them like she does. She can make anything into a treasure hunt: if they’ve been out shopping and Granny can’t remember where she parked Renault; or when she wants Elsa to go through her mail and pay her bills because Granny finds this insanely boring; or when there’s a sports day at school and Elsa knows the older children are going to lash her in the shower with rolled-up towels. Granny can make a parking area into magic mountains, and rolled-up towels into dragons that must be outsmarted. And Elsa is always the heroine.\"One adventure was traded for another upon Elsa’s birth. Granny had kind of stunk as a parent to Elsa’s mom as she was primarily traveling the world round on medical aid missions. Elsa is her opportunity to make up for some lost family time. Not surprisingly, with Granny’s u mmm “adventurous spirit”, in close quarters she tends to get on absolutely everyone’s last nerve. Fortunately though, Elsa knows \"that all of the things that Granny did were for [her] sake\". People that live life full on are known to step on toes occasionally, in actuality everyone can, but crazy grannies do it more; hence the need for her to say that she’s sorry.As Granny is coming close to death she creates a treasure hunt for Elsa. Don’t forget that Granny loves treasure hunts! The tasks that Elsa is given help her to understand Granny and the people who live around her in a better way while simultaneously offering closure for those from whom Granny seeks forgiveness. It brings a whole group of people together who had lived separate lives within close proximity. Each one of them shared a common tie to Granny but were not much more than neighbors in the same building. Through this adventure community is born. Through this adventure a child is healed.Don’t miss this read. It will fill you with laughter, it will have you shaking your head, it will make you wonder how much crazier the story can get, and it will make you shed a tear or two.I was given this ARC in exchange for my honest opinion. My many thanks to the author and publisher for this privilege. Loved this book! by ClouQ This is a most enchanting story. Granny is every grand child's dream grandparent. The story comes together just as Granny's fairy tales rivet the reader. I highly recommend this book.
