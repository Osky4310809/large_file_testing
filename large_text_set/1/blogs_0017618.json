Canadian brand Gildan (the same peeps responsible for Gold Toe socks and Anvil) has acquired the brand, and now, they’re shuttering its brick-and-mortar staples, as well as its headquarters. \n“They do have a plan, and that plan doesn’t involve US manufacturing and certainly not Los Angeles (which recently upped its minimum wage) manufacturing,” a chief investment banker unrelated to the company, Lloyd Greif, told the LA Times . \nInstead, they’ll likely move the brand elsewhere instead: As the Times pointed out, if the company’s past business endeavors are any indicator, it may be headed to resellers such as Target or Kmart, though nothing is set in stone at the moment — except the fact that come April, we’ll be SOL should we need any neon leggings. \nWe have to say — we really are sad to see this one go. After all, we got some truly great things from them over the years (including these awesome Halloween throwbacks ). \nRIP, AA —We’ll miss you! \nAre you sorry to see American Apparel go?
