It makes the world a smaller place and connects us so that we can better understand those who may have differing views from ours. It gives each of us a voice, so that people of goodwill may come together and share viewpoints in the spirit of mutual respect, in the hope of discovering common grou…. \n….Oh, who am I kidding? \nSocial media has transformed the internet into a weapon, an instrument of targeted destruction. \nIt is not enough, apparently, that I might disagree with you. It seems, of late, that if we disagree then you must die. \nIt is not enough, apparently, to shake your head and wonder at the things people do. It seems, of late, that if they offend us then they must pay. \nThey must be shamed, scorned and sentenced within minutes of the offense becoming public. \nAnd yeah, likely lose their jobs because a bunch of school bureaucrats are quivering at the attention turned their way. \nI’d like to say this story ends with the pair of them getting off with a short suspension for a demonstrated lack of better judgment and allowed to keep their day jobs. (Because clearly, they have no future in late-night comedy.) \nI’d like to say the administration will stand up to bullies and respond with something proportional to the act. (It is clear bad judgment, after all, these days to think that we can laugh at, well, anything.) \nI’d like to, but I don’t hold out much hope. \nMeanwhile, the administrators are getting death threats both online and, at least in the case of one of them, at home. \nImagine for a moment what it must be like to pick up your home phone and field a threat to you and your family because you dared to parody Donald Trump and in jest, called parents “morons.”. \nWhat are we doing, America?
