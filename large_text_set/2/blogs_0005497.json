They discovered the omega-3 fatty acids—the same compounds found in fatty fish like salmon and tuna—reduced the production of IgE, the antibodies that cause asthma symptoms. Omega-3s were most effective in people with milder cases of asthma, since corticosteroids, which are used to treat people with more severe cases, may blunt the beneficial effects. \nSupport Your Partner If your partner is feeling frazzled, she may try to push you away—but don’t let her: Supporting your mate during stressful times can reduce future depression and improve her self-esteem, researchers from the University of Alberta discovered. Doing so can even boost your self-esteem, too, the study found. \nPack In Protein You know that eating enough protein is vital for building—and maintaining—muscle and strength. But it might not matter where you’re getting it from. Researchers from the Institute for Aging Research found that greater amounts of dietary protein led to greater muscle health regardless of whether it came from animals or plants. (Here’s what and when you should eat if you want to build muscle.) \nBlock Your Ears N early 1 in 4 adults has signs of noise-induced hearing loss , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.
