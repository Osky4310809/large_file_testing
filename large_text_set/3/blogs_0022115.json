The post led to a fairly brief, respectful exchange between a few people from my high school and myself. My view that white locks are culturally appropriative has been shaped by the writings of black people with locks, published in any number of articles online including the one I posted in the comments of my post, as well as by conversations with black people who have locks. My post includes the line ‘please tell him to stop literally everything he’s doing.’ Hyperbole aside, if the person I saw has friends who share my views, I would encourage them to have a conversation with him about white locks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:53:41.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
