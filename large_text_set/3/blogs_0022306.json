Southwind High School says the commitment he made to Alabama just after his junior season is still firm. \nThe 6’5, 239-pound edge rusher spoke with SB Nation Sunday at the Nike Opening Regional Camp in New Orleans. With his length, frame and athleticism, it is easy to see why schools including LSU, Tennessee, Georgia, Louisville, and Florida offered Davis after his commitment to the Tide. \n“Other colleges are taking their chances, but I am still committed to Alabama,” Davis said while wearing Alabama gloves. “It’s still Roll Tide.”\nLSU and Tennessee are coming after Davis the hardest. \n“They want to support me and put me in their family.”\nBut Alabama still has the edge, in part because of how football-crazed the town and school are. \n“Alabama is very straight with you,” Davis said. “It’s straight football. I mean, I don’t want to go nowhere else where the basketball team is good, too. I want to go somewhere where it’s straight football, strictly football. And when you get down there, it’s straight business. Even the fans, you go to the restroom and the fans are talking about how the football team is. I really like the business part of it.”\nAs far as relationships on the staff, Davis is closest with his future position coach. \n“Coach Lupe (Tosh Lupoi) is my guy, and my future position coach.” “He talked to me about playing some Madden or [NBA] 2K when I get back down there.” \nLupoi coachs outside linebackers, so the natural question that follows is, ‘can Davis cover?’\n“Oh yes sir, yes sir I can. I can get out there in the flats, and that’s one main play [coach Lupoi] has shown me. That’s no problem for me, it’s my routine on Friday nights.”\nSome class of 2017 signing members are also recruiting Davis to stick with the Tide, including Vandarius Cowan. \nDavis hopes to return to Tuscaloosa soon. \n“I went down to Tuscaloosa a few months back, and will be going back soon for the spring game.”\nAlabama has finished with the No. 1 recruiting class for seven-consecutive years . As of March 21, the Tide has four commitments for the 2018 class.
