Rooney, Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw, Chris Smalling and Matteo Darmian: Five stars fighting for their Manchester United careers this summer \nJose Mourinho already knows who he wants to bring to Old Trafford... but who will make way? By Ryan Baldi, Football Whispers 7th February 2017, 3:53 pm Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments THE January transfer window may have closed but speculation over who Manchester United will sign in the summer is only growing. \nJose Mourinho claims that he already knows which players he will target, while the prospect of the Red Devils signing Antoine Griezmann for £85million looks increasingly real. Getty Images 15 Jose Mourinho already knows his top summer transfer targets, but he will need to offload some of his current stars to trim his squad \nBut, with the 20-time champions reportedly set to make as many as five high-profile purchases in the summer, some current Old Trafford stars must be moved on to make way. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Manchester United news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nFootball Whispers have identified the five players fighting for their Manchester United futures this season. \nAt the start of Jose Mourinho ’s reign, it seemed as though Juan Mata’s United future was extremely uncertain, but the Spaniard appears to have played his way into his manager’s long-term plans, while Marouane Fellaini, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo have also won the trust of the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss. related articles Team News Arsenal vs Hull: Hector Bellerin a doubt with concussion but Elneny should return after AFCON heartbreak TV TIMES Arsenal vs Hull: What TV channel is it on, what time is the match and what is SunSport's score prediction?

'Of course I would' Tennis star Rafael Nadal wants to become the next Real Madrid president after he retires SLAV BY YOUR MAN West Ham to offer boss Slaven Bilic a new contract at the end of the season... but only if they finish in the top eight \nAlthough Bastian Schweinsteiger has been reintegrated into the squad of late, he still seems certain to depart Manchester at the end of the current campaign, and Ashley Young’s six-year stay at Old Trafford looks like coming to an end amid interest from China. \nBut there are a handful of stars who are playing for their future at the club in the final months of the season. Reuters Anthony Martial has struggled for game time this season under Jose Mourinho at United Getty Images The French star enjoyed an impressive first season at Old Trafford last year Getty Images Martial has been linked with a move away, but claimed on Twitter those reports were rubbish Anthony Martial \nSeveral media outlets claimed recently that Anthony Martial is unhappy with the amount of game time he has seen in recent weeks, but the Frenchman took to Twitter yesterday to assure fans that that isn’t the case. \nBut the 21-year-old’s demeanour has told a different story of late, while Mourinho seems to be unhappy with what he is seeing out on the pitch from Martial. \nTop scorer in his debut season with United last term, few fans would have expected the £36million signing from Monaco to be facing an uncertain future at the club less than a year later. Manchester United fans sing song about Anthony Martial \nWith only two Premier League goals under his belt this season and completing just 1.3 dribbles per game in the league this term, down from 2.7 in 2015-16, Martial looks a shadow of the player who took English football by storm upon arriving from Ligue 1. \nIf Mourinho decides to cash in on the 15-cap France international, Paris Saint Germain will be at the front of the queue, according to the Mirror. Getty Images Luke Shaw made a great start to life at Man United until he suffered a horrific leg break last season Reuters Jose Mourinho has been openly critical of the left-back Shaw at times this season PA:Press Association Last month's FA Cup win over Wigan was Shaw's first appearance since he was hauled off at half time against West Ham in November Luke Shaw \nEngland full-ball Luke Shaw looked well on his way to fulfilling his immense potential last season before a horrific leg break curtailed his development. \nIn and out of the United side at the beginning of the current campaign, Mourinho has been openly critical of the youngster, insinuating that the former Southampton defender needs to start delivering on the promise he showed as a teenager which led the Red Devils to hand over £27million for his purchase in 2015. \nLast month’s FA Cup victory over Wigan Athletic was Shaw’s first appearance since being withdrawn at half-time in the 4-1 EFL Cup win over West Ham United in November. A series of niggling injuries can partly explain his absence, but it’s clear that Mourinho wants to see a lot more from the 21-year-old if he expects to make the left-back spot his own. Getty Images Matteo Darmian began the season out of the United side under Jose Mourinho Getty Images The Italian has 27 caps for his country and moved to Old Trafford in 2015 Getty Images Darmian has since returned to Mourinho's starting XI but in the unfamiliar role of left-back Matteo Darmian \nFormer AC Milan full-back Matteo Darmian found himself on the periphery of the United squad at the beginning of the season, before being reintroduced to the team in the less familiar role of left-back. \nThough defensively astute, with an impressive average of 2.5 tackles and 2.6 interceptions per game, Darmian is less comfortable when joining the attack, having failed to register a goal or an assist in his 10 Premier League outings so far this term. \nThe performances of Antonio Valencia have forced Darmian down the pecking order in his favoured right-back role, while Portuguese outlet Noticias Ao Minuto’s claims that the Red Devils have already agreed a deal to sign Benfica full-back Nelson Semedo in the summer suggests that the Italian could be heading back to Serie A in the near future. Getty Images After several impressive years at United, Smalling seems to have regressed this season Getty Images The England defender scored in the recent FA Cup victory over Wigan Getty Images Smalling has been overtaken by new boy Eric Bailly this season as the mainstay of the United defence Chris Smalling \nAfter producing the best form of his career in the early parts of last season, England centre-back Chris Smalling seems to have regressed this term. \nThe 27-year-old, who was signed from Fulham in 2010, has been unconvincing at the heart of United’s backline, with his shaky display in October’s 4-0 Stamford Bridge defeat to Chelsea marking a low point. \nUnited’s best defensive performances have come with Jones and Rojo paired at the back while Smalling was out injured, and his return to the side coincided with less assured displays against Stoke City and Hull City. \nEric Bailly, a £30million signing from Villarreal last year, has made a hugely impressive start to life at Old Trafford, and looks set to be a mainstay of Mourinho’s defence for years to come. \nSo that leaves one spot alongside the Ivory Coast international up for grabs. The fact that Portuguese newspaper O Jogo believes the Red Devils will sign Swedish centre-back Victor Lindelof in the summer should worry Smalling. Getty Images Wayne Rooney finally broke Sir Bobby Charlton's Manchester United goal record last month Getty Images The Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney is under contract at Old Trafford until 2019 Wayne Rooney \nHaving broken Sir Bobby Charlton’s long-standing United scoring record with a stunning stoppage-time free-kick against Stoke last month, Wayne Rooney has nothing left to achieve at club level. \nThe England captain has reiterated his desire to stay at Old Trafford for as long as possible, and with a £300,000-per-week contract running until 2019, he has every right to do so. Wayne Rooney breaks Sir Bobby Charlton’s Manchester United goalscoring record \nBut The Mirror believes that Rooney has been offered a whopping £700,000 a week to move to the cash-rich Chinese Super League, and Mourinho has already insisted he won’t stand in his skipper’s way if he wants to go – although the Football Whispers Index currently rates Everton as the 31-year-old’s most likely destination with a score of 1.4 out of five . \nWith widespread reports suggesting that the Red Devils will push the boat out to sign Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid in the summer – a 3.3 likelihood on the Football Whispers Index – it’s been speculated that they’d like to free up some space in their wage budget with Rooney’s departure.
