On Sunday, Pyongyang had blamed the U.S. for the isolated country’s nuclear and missile tests and warned it would test-launch the ICBM at any time from any place chosen by leader Kim Jong Un. \n“We are seriously concerned over this… We call on all sides to refrain from actions that could escalate the situation. We will closely monitor the situation and try to contribute to upholding peace and stability on the peninsula,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said . \n“The United Nations Security Council has clear rules for North Korea regarding its use of ICBM technology to test missiles. In this complex and sensitive situation, China asks all relevant parties to not engage in acts that will raise tensions,” Lu added .
