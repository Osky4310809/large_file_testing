Starbucks plans to hire 10,000 refugees over the next 5 years. This is CEO Howard Schultz’s plan to combat such a terrifying executive order, and he expressed his goal in an open letter in the Starbucks Newsroom.\n“We have a long history of hiring young people looking for opportunities and a pathway to a new life around the world. This is why we are doubling down on this commitment by working with our equity market employees as well as joint venture and licensed market partners in a concerted effort to welcome and seek opportunities for those fleeing war, violence, persecution and discrimination.” Starbucks CEO responds to Trump's Executive Order with plans to hire 10,000 Refugees over 5 years in 75 countries https://t.co/2PKfByzqzp pic.twitter.com/BCqz6fIimu \n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) January 29, 2017 He went on to describe Starbucks as a “place of opportunity,” especially for young people who are just starting out in the workforce and have come to America to begin a new life. “We are in business to inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time – whether that neighborhood is in a Red State or a Blue State; a Christian country or a Muslim country; a divided nation or a united nation. That will not change. You have my word on that.” \nvia GIPHY It’s reassuring to see that someone is taking active steps to influence positive change, and this news definitely made our day.\nEvery week brings a new challenge in the government, and that can feel overwhelming or out of control sometimes. But we all have the ability to influence something, whether it’s in the work place, or just our circle of friends. So let’s keep the momentum going , because there’s SO much work still to be done.\nH/T: Cosmopolitan \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T04:18:41.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
