Sessions also recused himself from any investigations into the Trump campaign, saying he had planned to do so anyway because he had stumped for Trump during the election and not because of the growing scandal he was forced to hold a press conference to address.

He declined to mention those meetings during his confirmation hearing when Senator Al Franken asked him, under oath, if he knew of any contact between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Sessions says they discussed a 1991 church trip he took to Russia and the status of Ukraine. \n“Most of these ambassadors are pretty gossipy,” Sessions said. \nIn his official statement, he said, “This announcement should not be interpreted as confirmation of the existence of any investigation or suggestive of the scope of any such investigation,” before misspelling Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente’s name.
