With 2017 shaping up to be the year of protest, with more marches planned on Washington , and people actively campaigning for change via social media, many are creating memes and hashtags to help spread the word. After Senator Elizabeth Warren was silenced for reading a letter from Coretta Scott King during a filibuster against Jeff Sessions nomination last week, #ShePersisted started trending on social. Many people created memes of famous women, but they weren’t necessarily the most inclusive. Now, one activist has resolved that problem, creating the most inclusive images this meme has seen. \nActivist and artist Angela C. Dumlao “Call Me They” created trans-inclusive #ShePersisted images and shared them to their social media on Thursday, giving even more voice to this hashtag. This is the type of thing that intersectional feminism tries to ensure: that all women and non-binary folks are included in our feminism. \nThey used images of trans actress Laverne Cox, Stonewall protester Marsha P. Johnson and many others, giving voice to trans women who otherwise had been overlooked by the hashtag. Representation always matters, and having different women within the meme helps give voice to all different people. Follow them on Twitter for more awesome work like this, and retweet your fave. \nWhat’s your favorite meme?
