But for this year's Grammys 2017 Paris Jackson and Lea Michele both switched the script and opted for untraditional eye looks. While Michele steered clear of mascara to give her all-over pink shadow a full stage, Jackson kept her lids bare—completely bare—with lots of mascara. Jo Baker , Jackson's makeup artist, exclusively walked us through the starlet's \"cool-girl glam\" look for the star-studded evening, here. \"Paris is tomboy at heart so she really likes less glam and being comfortable in her own skin,\" Baker explains to Allure of the star's fresh-faced look. \"There are certain things [Paris] likes to feature, and the rest of it is kept pretty neutral, pretty monochromatic. She’s going for less of a makeup look and more of a confidence look.\" A look we can totally get behind.

She likes to have a little element where she knows she can scratch her eye, or have a little area that’s hers.\" To balance out the rest of the look, Baker gave the star \"strong, yet natural brows with a sharp angular look,\" using the Rimmel London Professional Eyebrow Pencil in Dark Brown, which was also used to fill in any gaps in the brow. From there, Baker created subtle contour by sculpting Jackson's cheekbones using the Rimmel London Kate Sculpting & Highlighting Kit in Golden Sands but steered clear of blush. \"She’s not a girl that likes girly-girl blush,\" says Baker. \"It's that tomboy, badass, cool-girl approach to glam, which is not overly pretty and girly, it’s actually a little bit edgy and simple. It’s subtle.\" More exciting Grammys coverage:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:46:16.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
