Eddie Howe will be contemplating how he replaces the Dutchman, who had been a key part of his Bournemouth side this season. \nBut the group who have been most inconvenienced by Ake's return to Stamford Bridge? Fantasy football managers. Nathan Ake, the subject of some obscure fantasy laws (Photo: PA Wire) \nMost aficionados of the fantasy world play Fantasy Premier League, a game that currently features a huge total of 4,305,737 managers. \nOne of the key rules of FPL states that you can only pick three players from any Premier League club. At the moment, 9.9 percent of all managers have Ake in their team right now - that equates to 430,000 people who have selected the (until very recently) Bournemouth man. \nNow consider how many managers already have multiple Chelsea players in their side. 44.4 percent of teams include Diego Costa. 34.2 percent have Eden Hazard. 21 percent have Cesar Azpilicueta. 15.4 percent have Thibaut Courtois.

The key rule (Photo: Fantasy Premier League) \nThe rules state that: \nIf a player is transferred to another team in the Premier League, and this transfer takes you over the players per team limit, then you will need to go back under the limit when making your next transfers. \nSo, if you already have Ake and three Chelsea players in your side, you could actually get away with keeping them all… you just wouldn't be able to make another transfer. \nSounds a lot like a transfer embargo to us… Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T16:56:20.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
