It is not easy to achieve what the protocol states.” \nThe Vice-Chancellor used the occasion to clarify what he called the current misinformation about changes in the costs and delays in the delivery of the PC tablets to the students. \nHe said, “To start with, the tablet project started four years ago when we conceived the idea to make University of Ilorin’s graduates well-equipped for the challenges of the outside world which they will soon face when they leave here.” \nAmbali said that until sometimes in 2015, when the naira began to depreciate significantly in value, the project was smooth and trouble-free. \nThe VC added that most operations in the university were digital, adding that the business of the university’s Senate was paperless. \nHe said, “You will not see professors and senate members of the university carrying lots of pamphlets in their hands going to the senate chambers. \n“Unilorin was the first to start the Computer-Based Test in the country. We started it more than 10 years ago.” \nHe said that for the university to be having a paperless Senate, having cashless environment, the teaching and learning on the campus have to be ICT-based. \nHe said it was heart-warming to hear laudable achievements from students of the university at their various NYSC camps and the offices where they were employed. \nOn the issue of accommodation, the VC said, “When we started the project about four years ago, about 3,000 out of over 30,000 students that we had were accommodated on the campus. \n“The present administration under my leadership embarked on an advocacy to sell the university to friends of the University. \n“This was done to attract them to come and build hostels on our campus under the Federal Government’s directive of Build-Operate-and-Transfer.” \nNAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T17:35:33.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
