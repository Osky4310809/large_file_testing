A hotel in Portstewart to here. \n“A lot has happened since I had my first fight and it is hard to believe really. It makes you proud. \n“Just to see your name up in lights in Vegas, I never really believed this could happen when I turned professional. \n“I would have been happy to have won a world title and that to be it but as my career has progressed I feel like I’m making new goals and targets all the time.” \nThere was no victory that night against his opponent from Scorpion Boxing Club as both were under the age of 11 and barely over 20kg so could not compete competitively. \nBut there have been plenty of victories since then. \nFrampton had a successful amateur career in Ireland before being spotted by mentor and manager Barry McGuigan at the 2007 EU amateur boxing championships. \nHe would turn professional in 2009 with McGuigan and they have not taken a step back since. \nNow with an unbeaten record of 23 wins, Frampton looks to defend the title once held by his mentor on the biggest stage he has ever been on and is arguably the best of the UK’s 13 reigning world champions. \nThe Belfast man has been in Las Vegas for the last three weeks acclimatising to the time difference and conditions, but it has also given him a chance to see his name plastered down the side of the MGM Grand on his walks down the Strip.

This is a long way from the picturesque seaside town of Portstewart. \nThe MGM Grand Garden Arena was once the home of Floyd Mayweather Jnr and hosted some of the biggest fights in the sport’s recent history, including the American’s clash with Manny Pacquiao. \nFrampton used to stay up overnight in his Tigers Bay to watch the likes of Mike Tyson and his hero and compatriot Wayne McCullough, Northern Ireland’s last world champion before him, in action. \nBut dreams of one day being the star in the city famous for gambling never entered his head with aspirations closer to home and in a different sport. \n“When I was a kid and watched the big fights I never really thought ‘I would love that to be me’,” he said. \n“I probably never believed that it would have been me if I’m being honest. \n“I was more dreaming about playing football for the Crues (Crusaders FC) or something like that. \n“Just to be here in this position now and to top the bill with the calibre of fighter I am facing is great.” \nFrampton believes there will be around 4,000 making the trip from the UK and Ireland to watch him in action this weekend. \nAnd he plans to make it a night to remember not just for them but for himself. \n“You can’t dwell on it too much now,” he added. \n“You have to wait until you hang up the gloves to reflect on it. \n“I’ll probably be that wee man sitting in the bar telling everyone about the time I topped the bill in Vegas. \n“It makes me proud and very honoured to do it. It has been a long road, but I feel like I deserve to be here.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:54:54.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
