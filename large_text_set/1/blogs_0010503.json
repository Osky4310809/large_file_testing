The documents appear to mostly deal with the handling of computer hardware collected from Clinton’s lawyers for the investigation. \nThe FBI has previously released notes from interviews it conducted during its investigation of Clinton’s handling of classified information. FBI director James Comey declined to recommend that Clinton be charged in the case, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch accepted that advice. \nCheck back for more updates as The Daily Caller digs through the documents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:42:04.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
