Renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch , the property is currently going for a cool $67 million USD.\nThe 2,700-acre estate comes equipped with a pool, tennis courts, a lake, train station, barn, guest house, and a separate building with a dance studio and 50-person movie theater.\nThe late Jackson originally bought the Santa Barbara County, California property back in 1987, then naming it after the the fictional world in Peter Pan where kids never grow up. He outfitted the space with rides, a petting zoo and various other attractions in order to entertain children.\nJackson stopped living at the mansion after his molestation trial in 2005. Before his death in 2009, Michael sold Neverland Ranch to Colony Capital for $22.5 million USD. Colony Capital redeveloped the home, then doing away with the amusement park rides and exotic animals.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:04:25.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
