As we noted at the time, those two tweets were subsequently removed from the account’s timeline. Looks like the Trump administration hasn't taken control of the @NatlParkService Twitter feed just yet. pic.twitter.com/dCKGHoW0cU \n— Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) January 20, 2017 \nWell, it appears that someone in the Trump Administration was none too happy with those tweets and has now told all National Park employees to stop using official Twitter accounts “until further notice.” In an email to staff obtained by Gizmodo, NPS workers were told they would need to find contingency plans to deal with this order. \nAll: \nWe have received direction from the Department through [the Washington Support Office] that directs all [Department of Interior] bureaus to immediately cease use of government Twitter accounts until further notice. \nPWR parks that use Twitter as part of their crisis communications plans need to alter their contingency plans to accommodate this requirement. Please ensure all scheduled posts are deleted and automated cross-platform social media connections to your twitter accounts are severed. The expectation is that there will be absolutely no posts to Twitter. \nIn summary, this Twitter stand down means we will cease use of Twitter immediately. However, there is no need to suspend or delete government accounts until directed.﻿ \nThis does not affect use of other approved social media platforms. We expect further guidance to come next week and we will share accordingly. \nThanks for your help! \nGizmodo also stated that a park ranger told them that unofficially it was due to the two retweets. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T11:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T06:47:20.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
