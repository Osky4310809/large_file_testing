Instagram \nYeah. \nKhloé dished about her special Valentine’s Day with Tristan when she joined “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” recently. \nShe said, \nI am going to be in Cleveland with Tristan. He actually has a game on Valentine’s Day, so I will be with him after the game. \nI’ll probably cook dinner, have food waiting for him when he comes home… maybe look a little sexy.

James Harden Explains How Khloe Kardashian Was Dragging Down His Life & Career https://t.co/QsaLlNiijV via @thacover2 pic.twitter.com/oLqdVnfBbT \nRecently, in a longform interview with Sports Illustrated’s Lee Jenkins, the 27-year-old Harden appeared to dish on why his relationship with Khloé Kardashian didn’t work out . \nSpeaking with Jenkins, James Harden said, \nI’m not worried about anything but hooping, and that may be why I’m having this kind of success. \nI didn’t like all the attention. I feel like it was for no reason. I wasn’t getting anything out of it except my name out there and my face out there, and I don’t need that. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it wasn’t me. \nI don’t need pictures of myself when I’m driving my car. Who cares? What shoes am I wearing? Who cares? Where am I eating? Who cares? It was unnecessary stuff that I think trickled down to my teammates. I had to eliminate that. \nWhoa! \nSo, it sounds a lot like Harden is saying he’s now finding success on the court because he ditched Khloé Kardashian , and the media circus that follows her, off of it. \nI mean, Harden is averaging 28.8 points per game at the moment and has started all of the Rockets’ 61 games this season. \nHarden’s also averaging a career high in assists per game, 11.3, and the Rockets are the third best team in the Western Conference. \nCare to respond, Khloé? \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
