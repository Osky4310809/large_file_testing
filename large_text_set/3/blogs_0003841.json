PUBLISHED: 16:04, Thu, Mar 2, 2017 | UPDATED: 16:45, Thu, Mar 2, 2017 GETTY Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU will 'never become a state' \nThe EU Commission chief insisted any dreams some politicians may have of a United States of Europe are dead and buried amid voter apathy about the project and growing divisions amongst its member states on migration, Brexit and trade. \nHe admitted that he was once a federalist himself, but said he now appreciated that ordinary Europeans will not accept the imposition of a superstate by the back door and that Brussels must allow national governments a greater say on Europe-wide policy. Related articles Brussels calls on EU leaders to agree 'special relationship' with UK \nMr Juncker’s remarks came after he launched an historic white paper on how to save the struggling project yesterday, which unusually consisted of a massive consultation exercise on five “pathways” for the future. \nUnlike in previous years the Commission and its chief have flatly refused to express a preference for how they want the EU to move forward, save to say that they do not believe a return to a simple trading alliance would be the right course of action. EbS The EU boss made the remarks at a press conference in Slovenia EbS Mr Juncker berated MEPs for their reaction to his white paper \nEurocrats, who are unelected, have been stung by a fall in voter support for the bloc and repeated accusations that this has been caused by a dictatorial approach of loftily handing down decrees without consulting citizens. \nBut some MEPs have criticised the plan saying that eurocrats should have taken a strong stance on the issue and simply handed down a solution, prompting an exasperated Mr Juncker to berate them and demand: “Sh*t, what do you want us to do?” \nThe Brussels boss addressed the criticism further today during a visit to one of the club’s newest members, Slovenia, where he discussed the future of the EU, migration and Brexit with prime minister Miro Cerar. No, no, no, we’ll never become a state Jean-Claude Juncker \nHe said: “I know from my past experience as prime minister in Luxembourg that in smaller member states people don’t believe, our citizens don’t believe that their country has an influence. Slovenia has an influence and is a positive actor in the EU. \n“Smaller member states, they should not try to gain some importance by saying no. Smaller member states have to be a force of proposals, trying to bring European integration to its very end without wanting to give the impression that European Union is something like United States of America. \n“No, no, no, we’ll never become a state. I used to be a federalist when I was 15 but that’s a long time ago as you can see.” \nHe added: “Now I do think that the EU has to be constructed not against nations and member states, but together with nations and member states. \n“That’s of importance to smaller member states because small member states, bigger member states they’re equal in rights and they have the same dignity.” What countries are in the EU?
