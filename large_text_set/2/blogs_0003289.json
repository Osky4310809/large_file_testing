Natalie Portman’s Ruth Bader Ginsburg movie will have a badass female director! Mimi Leder will helm the film, called On The Basis Of Sex . She is sure to bring an awesome perspective to an already alluring script.\nAs can be seen from the subject matter, this movie depicts one of the coolest Supreme Court justices , RBG. Ginsburg was the first Jewish female justice and she will be played by Natalie Portman , who is Jewish herself. Now we are lucky enough to add another badass lady into the mix, and as a director no less!\nThe Script \nIn addition to penning the script, Daniel Stiepelman is also Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s actual nephew. Meaning we can learn things about RBG that no one knew before! Of course, that means he might have a certain bias when it comes to the subject matter, but that is par for the course when dealing with biopics. Because Daniel Stiepelman has access to all the juicy details on his aunt, we await amazing insights into this icon’s sharp wits.\nThe Director \nIn any event, the Natalie Portman’s Ruth Bader Ginsburg movie is a promising one. Daniel’s script for On The Basis Of Sex has been on everyone’s radars for a while. It even landed on the coveted Black List in Hollywood. Now that it has Mimi Leder directing, everything is coming up Bader! Mimi is the force responsible for Deep Impact, Pay It Forward, and The Peacemaker. Not only does she have a great eye cinematically, she is also able to get amazing performances from her actors.\nIt looks like quite a few women are going to get the opportunities they deserve with this project!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:10:31.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
