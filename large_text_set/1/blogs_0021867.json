We could struggle against the inevitability of the coming chill, or we could embrace it. At least the good parts, anyway. \nWe’re talking about sorbet. Specifically, apple pie sorbet. \nThank heaven for small mercies. All photos by Sydney Mondry. \nThis one comes courtesy of Elise Kornack of Brooklyn’s Take Root , where Kornack and her wife, Anna Hieronimus, serve tasting menus to a mere 12 diners at a time. \nWhile that might sound fancy, this sorbet is not. But it’s not just some frozen apple juice, either. \nTo start, Kornack cooks sliced apples in butter to get them to that tender, soft, pie-filling consistency. \nOnce that’s done, she purées them in a blender along with some fresh apples and apple juice, for extra apple punch. \nShe then passes that through a strainer for a super-silky texture. \nThen comes the additives: sugar, of course, along with some citric acid (the stuff that’s found in lemons and limes, and easily sourced online) for a little bit of lip-puckering zing. \nThe problem with a lot of sorbet, however, is that it often gets grainy and melts rather quickly. Kornack’s chef solution: stabilizer and xanthan gum, also easily found online. \nAll of those get blended together one more time, resulting in an ultra-smooth base that will remain creamy when frozen, even though it doesn’t contain a drop of cream. \nGive it a spin in whatever kind of ice cream machine you have, and you suddenly have the best of both worlds: a cool dessert and comforting pie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T07:11:50.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
