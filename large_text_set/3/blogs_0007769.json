Check out a video of the event below.\n“Biggie Smalls, Frank White, the king of New York. He died 20 years ago today in a tragedy that occurred in Los Angeles. But his words live on forever,” Jeffries said. “I got the privilege of representing the district where Biggie Smalls was raised.”\n“We know he went from negative to positive and emerged as one of the world most important hip hop stars. His rags-to-riches life story is the classic embodiment of the American dream. Biggie Smalls is gone but he will never be forgotten. Rest in piece Notorious B.I.G.. Where Brooklyn at?”\nJust paid tribute to late/great #BiggieSmalls on House flr.
