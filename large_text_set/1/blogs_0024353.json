Profiling Chance for GQ last August, Zach Baron said that the rapper worked for \"actual months\" on the song, layering the gospel harmonies and wringing every drop of sweetness from it. The result was an unlikely thing of beauty and one that, in hindsight, gave Chancelor Bennett an opportunity to explore his foundations. It was all worth it in the end . \nLast night, Chance appeared on The Late Show to perform the track alongside host Stephen Colbert, band leader Jon Batiste, and the song's original composer, Ziggy Marley. The daydream sketch recreates Arthur 's original intro sequence with color and charm and is entirely worth watching below. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T20:36:12.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
