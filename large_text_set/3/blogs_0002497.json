We prefer ‘Trendlebury’ at foxfooty.com.au . \nNo matter your title preference, Scott Pendlebury and Adam Treloar form an exciting on-ball for Collingwood fans and loom as one of Nathan Buckley’s biggest weapons ahead of the biggest season of his coaching career. \nGeelong fans entered 2016 full of excitement at the prospect of superstar on-baller Patrick Dangerfield uniting with skipper Joel Selwood at Simonds Stadium. \nThe results were electric, with the two players thriving both individually and collectively. \nDangerfield had a career-best season in 2016, winning his first Brownlow Medal, averaging one goal per game and breaking Champion Data’s metres gained record. His presence also helped ease the burden on Selwood, who averaged four more uncontested possessions per game compared to 2015 while also maintaining his elite contested ball status. \nBut if you were a Magpies fan disheartened by your side’s slide down the ladder, you would’ve found great joy in Pendlebury and Treloar’s output. \nIn fact, Trendlebury’s numbers were on-par — if not better — than Dangerwood’s. Geelong’s Patrick Dangerfield and Joel Selwood were excellent at winning the contested ball. Picture: Michael Klein Source: News Corp Australia \nAccording to the Official AFL Player Rating s — which Champion Data recognises as the best indication of a player’s performance as it emphasises the quality of games played over the quantity — Dangerfield and Selwood only averaged one more point per game than Pendlebury and Treloar. \nWhen it came to winning the footy, 0.9 of a disposal separated the two pairings. Dangerwood won a lot more inside ball (+5.3) and clearances (+3.2), but Trendlebury was better in racking up the uncontested possessions (+3.7). \nBut it’s on the defensive side of the game where the star Magpies combination had Dangerfield and Selwood covered, with Trendlebury averaging 1.6 more tackles and 1.8 more pressure points per game. They were also +3.6% up on Dangerwood for kicking efficiency. \nWIN FREE FOXTEL!

In fact the Pies have the best midfield in the competition, according to Champion Data . \nWhile the on-ball brigade is obviously headlined by the ‘elite’ duo of Pendlebury and Treloar, the ‘above average’ trio of Taylor Adams, Steele Sidebottom and veteran recruit Daniel Wells are quality players. Add an exciting prospect in Jordan De Goey and the ever-improving Jack Crisp, it sees the Pies’ midfield sit above both the Bulldogs and Giants’ groups. Collingwood’s Taylor Adams, Adam Treloar and Scott Pendlebury will lead the league’s No. 1 midfield in 2017. Picture: Michael Klein Source: News Corp Australia \nThat midfield strength is why Essendon champion Tim Watson is optimistic about Collingwood’s chances in 2017. \n“I think they’re stronger (overall), but if you really want to cut to the chase with Collingwood, you talk about their midfield power,” Watson told SEN on Thursday. \n“Pendlebury and Treloar as a pair are greater (numbers-wise) than Dangerfield and Selwood in terms of their impact. Then you add Steele Sidebottom into that mix and then you’ve got Wells — hopefully — Adams, (Levi) Greenwood, Crisp and (James) Aish.” \nBut Watson said the Pies’ on-ball brigade had to perform this season to save Buckley, as there’s still ample development needed inside both 50m arcs. \n“That midfield has to be that good, because I think they’ve got to have the most powerful midfield in the competition because there are still some doubts about their front half and there are still some doubts about their back half,” Watson said. \nNo matter Collingwood’s win-loss ratio this season, Pies fans will be able to rely on consistent, high-level efforts from both Pendelbury and Treloar. \nAnd perhaps by season’s end, Trendelbury might’ve superseded Dangerwood. \nThe newly-formed ‘Pritchell’, however, could have something to say about that. \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.
