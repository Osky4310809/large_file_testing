Some sort of explosion just heard outside #coralsprings \n— David Henry (@dshuf04) February 17, 2017 Who heard that explosion in Weston ? \n— Camilo Andres ® (@Crueda7) February 17, 2017 \nOthers said they felt their house shake from a “sonic boom.” @CityofWeston did anyone else hear the loud bang & house shake?
