It’s a very real piece of software created by a high school student from West Virginia. \nRobbie Barrat, a 17-year-old hip-hop fan and coding whiz, taught himself to code using open source software, according to a report from Quartz . \nInitially, the software simply rearranged 6,000 Kanye rap phrases to create new songs, but now the software has been modified to create original rap lines using the Kanye word bank. \nOn the YouTube Page demonstrating the software’s ability, Barrat says, “Excluding the beat; this song was written 100 percent by a deep neural network.” \nThe results? Well, depending upon what you think of Kanye’s ego-tripping flights of fancy, this AI spit-bot’s bars might actually be as good as the real thing. \nWarhol that , Pablo. \nIf you’re interested in adding your own twist on the rap-powered Singularity, Barrat has posted the code for his project on GitHub.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T08:35:11.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
