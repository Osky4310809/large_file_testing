These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium,” it continued. \nKeep in mind that the University of Cincinnati is a public institution. Public funds are going toward this insanity. \nThis is not even a thing that should offend white people. It should offend everybody. \nConsider the following hypothetical: Replace the term “white” in the workshop title with “Muslim,”“Jew,”“Christian,”“Black,” or any other way you can conceive to group people.
