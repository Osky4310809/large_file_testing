Patriotism is somehow problematic and the latest incident occurred in Iowa, where students wore red, white, and blue that triggered the opposing team, which had players from families who are refugees. I’m not making this up (via WHOtv ): The Valley High School-Des Moines North State Tournament game was one for the ages. \"They played hard,\" said Morgan Wheat, an assistant coach at Des Moines North. \"We had a chance to win at the end. Hats off to Valley, they made more plays.\" \n[…] \nValley students had chosen to wear red, white and blue instead of their school colors black and orange. \"Any normal person, any educated person can look at that and think what the hell are these kids thinking,\" said Wheat. \nThe Polars team is filled with players who come from refugee families and fans took to social media wondering the same thing. \"Kids are kids, I get it, but I do have questions. I want to know why.\" \n[…] \nTo the Students and Staff of North High School: \nIt has been brought to our attention that the decision by the Valley High School student section to wear U.S.A. apparel at our game last night was offensive to members of your community and fan base. We are deeply sorry if we have offended anyone in any way. We have traditionally dressed in such a fashion for great games such as the one last night. Everyone here at Valley has immense respect not only for your team and players but for your community as a whole. Please know that our intent was in no way to offend or demean—just to support our own team in a way we have done before. \nCongratulations on a wonderful season and we wish you nothing but the best of luck in the future. \nSincerely, \nValley High School Student Council Leadership \nSeriously—you might be labeled a racist for outward displays patriotism? Moreover, it’s now only an issue because the political correctness police made it one. These aren’t triggering antics. Fox News added other instances of the political correctness police cracking down on innocuous displays of American pride: In Oklahoma, students at a Tulsa high school were blocked from bringing flags and banners on \"USA Night.\" \nIn South Carolina, a high school banned the American flag in the stands, claiming it had been used in the past to taunt opposing teams with Hispanic players. \nMaybe the Russians were involved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:42:32.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
