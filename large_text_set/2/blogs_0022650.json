Finance Minister, Mrs Kemi ADEOSUN \nAdesoun stated that investment in critical infrastructure across the country would unlock job and wealth creation and strengthen economic development across all states in Nigeria. \nWhile speaking on the outlook for the Nigerian economy, the Minister noted that government was committed to increasing spending on critical infrastructure across key sectors, including power, rail, roads and water, which would underpin growth in priority sectors, especially Agriculture and Agro-Allied, Solid Minerals, Manufacturing, and Power. \nAccording to her, “we will now target 30 percent of government expenditure on infrastructure, up from 10 percent”. \nAdeosun said the Federal Government would mobilise private capital to complement government spending on infrastructure. \n“We recognise that government spending alone will be inadequate to bridge the infrastructure gap and we have started engaging the private sector through our housing fund and the road trust fund for which fundraising is in progress,” she said.
