For example, y ou could tweet at Wendy's and get mercilessly roasted by them , or you could hit up Chrissy Teigen and get savagely put in your place by her too .\nBut because we're talking about the internet here, not every online interaction is about getting ridiculed for being stupid. No, because this is the web, people don't really have much of a filter and feel like they can talk about anything.\nLike this dude who tweeted at a popular British supermarket chain about penises and donuts.\nBecause the donuts he purchased from Morrisons don't have holes in them, he can no longer use them in the bedroom. @Morrisons oi there's no ring in my donuts how I'm I supposed to put these on my willy and get my girlfriend to eat them off now ???? pic.twitter.com/ZFCOfKUwHn \n— silverfox? (@PeeWeeMFC75) January 6, 2017 Now this is disgusting. I know it is, but because the guy decided to put a whole bunch of angry faces on it, it transforms would could have easily been just a gross tweet into a gross/funny tweet. And, I beg everyone's pardon here, I think the emojis also make this nasty bit of correspondence oddly charming.\n\nMorrisons must have thought so too, or at least thought enough of @PeeWeeMFC75's tweet to respond. @PeeWeeMFC75 Improvise! - Cam\n— Morrisons (@Morrisons) January 6, 2017 \nAnd thus began a full-fledged online conversation between a supermarket chain's PR-run Twitter account, and a customer... @Morrisons I did I'm now in a&e with burns from the onion rings\n— silverfox? (@PeeWeeMFC75) January 6, 2017 \n...about putting penises in donuts. @PeeWeeMFC75 You didn't wait for them to cool down? - Cam\n— Morrisons (@Morrisons) January 6, 2017 \nAnd things got very revealing. @Morrisons you don't know my mrs she's very demanding cam ?\n— silverfox? (@PeeWeeMFC75) January 6, 2017 \nAnd Morrisons stayed helpful every step of the way. @PeeWeeMFC75 She sounds it! My advise, leave everything to chill for 2 minutes. - Cam\n— Morrisons (@Morrisons) January 6, 2017 \nAn unlikely friendship was then forged. @Morrisons thanks cam it's nice to finally talk to someone about this\n— silverfox? (@PeeWeeMFC75) January 6, 2017  \n@PeeWeeMFC75 If you need anything else, you know where I am - Cam\n— Morrisons (@Morrisons) January 6, 2017 Cam and Silverfox, forever.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T17:55:18.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
