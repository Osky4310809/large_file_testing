This time a firm named TrendForce is suggesting a few features we can expect from the iPhone 8, though a rounded screen isn’t one of them.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com The site said the iPhone 8 will pack a 5.8-inch display and will sit in Apple’s arsenal as the best-of-the-best new iPhones, above even the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus that are expected to launch at the same time. It says, however, that Apple has scrapped ideas of including a rounded OLED panel, something that seemed like a lock until now. Word on the street is Apple can’t get enough high-quality panels from suppliers.\nInstead, Apple’s going to go for an edge-to-edge design, but without any bendable panels in sight. The phone is also expected to offer 3GB of RAM and 64GB or 256GB storage options, the same that will be available for the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. TrendForce also points to a 3D camera of sorts, which was mentioned in a rumor earlier this morning.\nS8 and Note 8 still expected to pack curved OLED I’m not sure this is a big deal, so long as the iPhone 8 has a great display it doesn’t really matter if it curves or not. This might give Samsung a bit of a leg-up with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8, which will almost certainly pack curved panels. Anyone who was planning to switch to the iPhone for that reason will no longer want to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:18:16.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
