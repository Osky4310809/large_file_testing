Today, at its pre-MWC event in Barcelona, the Korean giant has unleashed the LG G6 to the world.

The UX 6.0 offers a differentiated experience for viewing content such as videos and web browsing. LG says that the smartly-designed GUI enables opening two perfectly square windows side by side. The device also comes pre-loaded with the Google Assistant, which makes it the first smartphone after the Pixel duo to offer it. \nComing to the other specs, the LG G6 flaunts a 5.7-inch quad-HD+ FullVision display.
