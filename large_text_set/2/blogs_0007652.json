Oakland went 12-4 only to see its season derailed when quarterback Derek Carr suffered a broken leg in the second to last game of the regular season, leading to a wild-card playoff loss to Houston. \n“We are excited to continue building on the strong foundation that has been established and this is a significant step in achieving that goal,” Davis said in a statement . \nFormer Denver defensive coordinator Del Rio took over two years ago as the team’s ninth head coach since the start of the 2003 season. The Raiders had the NFL’s worst record in that span, failing to produce a single winning season or playoff berth. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:04:02.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
