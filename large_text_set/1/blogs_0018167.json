They were also interested in Crystal Palace midfielder Yohan Cabaye – but will not pay the transfer fee on top of the player’s wages. Nice are a growing force with new owners financing signings such as Balotelli (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nNow, they are waiting in the wings to see how Payet’s situation develops with Marseille, and appear willing to to step in to end his stay under Slaven Bilic. \nPayet is lucky he hasn’t been pinned up against the wall by angry West Ham players, according to Hammers legend Martin Allen. \nThe wantaway Frenchman’s car was vandalised outside his home on Thursday and senior players have cut him from their WhatsApp group. \nAllen, who played 190 games for the club, is disgusted by Payet’s behaviour and reckons he should have been sold as quickly as possible. \nAllen said: “Payet doesn’t give a toss about the club or his team-mates. His awful displays have been jeopardising their careers. It’s their living and he’s disrupting their livelihood to get a move, which could relegate the club.
