Exercising can improve joint function with arthritis , researchers from Northwestern University found. Those who exercised for just 45 minutes a week were 80 percent more likely to improve or sustain their functional movement over two years, the study found. And it doesn’t need to be intense—even brisk walking can work. \nSleep Soundly Struggling with insomnia can raise your risk of asthma , researchers from Norway discovered. People who reported problems falling asleep “often” or “almost every night” were 65 percent and 108 percent more likely to develop asthma over 11 years, respectively. The researchers believe the effects of insomnia may be harming your airways. \nSpot Stroke Fast treatment is necessary to treat stroke, and a delay in seeking medical help can be deadly.
