Credit Michael Flecker, via Asia Society A trove of porcelain and other items excavated from an Arab cargo ship will go on view in the U.S. for the first time next month in an exhibition at the Asia Society Museum in New York, six years after another planned display was canceled amid ethical concerns. The treasure, salvaged from a ship that sank en route from China to the Persian Gulf in the ninth century, was discovered by commercial sea cucumber divers in 1998 off the coast of Indonesia. It was first shown in 2005 in Singapore, which purchased the contents. Among the items are solid-gold dishes, a silver wine flask, blue-and-white ceramics and copper mirrors decorated with Tang Chinese patterns of lions, grapevines and flying birds. In 2011, the cache was scheduled to go on display at the Smithsonian’s Sackler Gallery in Washington, D.C. However, archaeologists and scientists demanded the show’s cancellation, arguing that the excavation, by a commercial salvaging company, had been too hasty and had failed to satisfy academic standards — potentially jeopardizing historically important material.
