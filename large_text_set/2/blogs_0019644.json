Oh, and male models. For real.\nWe just heard that a couple of male models rescued six teens who fell through the ice in Central Park while they were trying to snap a selfie. Here’s how it went down: Bennett Jonas and Ethan Turnbull (AKA: THE MODELS) were skateboarding nearby when they saw the group of teens fall into the ice . They sprung into action and worked together to pull each kid out of the freezing water, including two who sank extremely far beneath the surface.\nvia GIPHY \nBoth guys reflected on this scary — and heroic — experience on social media. “We ran over and immediately we’re put in the toughest situation I think we will have to go through. 6 kids screaming for help being pulled down by each other, soaking backpacks and huge jackets. I had to make a decision to get in the middle of that or watch them drown,” Jonas said in his post.\n@ethanturnbull and I tonight went out to Skateboard around Central Park. Passing a frozen lake we saw a group of 6 kids go though the ice. We ran over and immediately we're put in the toughest situation I think We will have to go through. 6 kids screaming for help being pulled down by each other, soaking backpacks and huge jackets. I had to make a decision to get in the middle of that or watch them drown. When I got about waist deep two of the kids jumped on top of me and pulled me under. I had to pick them both up and throw them to Ethan. I then grabbed a ladder and pulled the next 2 in. Behind them were two lifeless bodies that I knew I couldn't get too. I swam out and grabbed the last two guys and was able to get them to shore and keep them alive. I feel humbled and grateful that God called me to be there tonight, I'm still shaking and am completely shook by what I experienced, but I'm alive and so are 6 other kids who got very lucky tonight. \nA post shared by @bennett_jonas on Feb 20, 2017 at 8:39pm PST \nThese guys were definitely in the “right place at the right time,” as Turnbull (who is an Aussie FYI) notes in his post. They’re lucky to be alive, and the teens who fell in are extremely lucky to have been saved by people who acted so quickly and calmly. They suffered mild hypothermia, but were given the okay to be released from hospital shortly after.\n'Right place right time' - Fortunate enough to have been in the position to help multiple younger generation New Yorker's today. With out the help of my Buddy @bennett_jonas the outcome of this event would have been much different.

But seriously — we’re blown away by their bravery and their willingness to put themselves in danger to help absolute strangers. The world needs more of this, and we’re just so glad everyone ended up being okay!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:33:31.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
