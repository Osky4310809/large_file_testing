They won a record-equalling four medals, including a first ever medal on snow in Jenny Jones' snowboard slopestyle bronze. \nHalfpipe skier Rowan Cheshire was also being talked about as a medal prospect in Russia having won a World Cup a month earlier. But her Games ended dramatically before her event began. \nThe then 18-year-old was training on the Olympic halfpipe at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, when she made a mistake. Cheshire landed on her head, knocking herself unconscious and breaking her nose. \n\"I don't remember anything, just waking up in hospital and wondering what the hell was going on,\" she told BBC Sport. \nIt resulted in a severe concussion and was the first of three head injuries over the next 18 months, which Cheshire said caused \"severe side-effects\" that changed her life and almost saw her leave the sport. \n\"It's not just a headache or a little bruise to the head, there's a lot of backlash - I couldn't even look at my phone without getting migraines,\" said the skier. \n\"As well as the physical stuff, there was the emotional side - I'd get anxious and have a breakdown or a panic attack at just little situations and have to come home. \nAll the complications started in Sochi with the horrendous crash Pat Sharples British freestyle skiing head coach \n\"After the Olympics I wouldn't be able to get on the train by myself and that's weird for me as an athlete because I travel everywhere, but I wouldn't do it without my mum with me.\" \nBritish freestyle skiing head coach Pat Sharples has known Cheshire since she was a young teenager, trying out the sport on a dry slope in Stoke. \n\"All the complications started in Sochi with the horrendous crash,\" he told BBC Sport. \"The two concussions after that weren't anything like as huge as she'd had before, but it still triggered a lot of difficulties. \n\"It was new territory for us and a huge learning curve for everyone on the team as we'd never had to deal with anything like this. \n\"We were told it was 50/50 as to whether she would get back to fitness, but we just wanted her to be OK. It wasn't about her being back on skis.\" \nCheshire spent months working with her psychologist, Dave Collins, to overcome the anxiety of putting her body and mind on the line again. \n\"I did go through some doubts - I think it's only natural after a bad injury as it knocks your self-confidence and your whole thought process about the sport,\" she said.
