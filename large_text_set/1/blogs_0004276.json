One of the buildings, at 566 feet and 39 stories, would be one of Boston’s 15 tallest. It is due to contain up to 160 condos. The other tower would run to 283 feet and 24 floors; and would hold up to 182 apartments. Developer Weiner Ventures says its plan for what’s being called 1000 Boylston Street would transform “an underdeveloped Back Bay streetscape and air rights expanse into a fully-integrated dynamic hub of residential housing and retail activity.” The developer, a partnership between Adam Weiner and Steve Samuels, acquired the parcels and air rights for the project from the state in 2013. The whole affair hinges on building a 23,000-square-foot platform over the Turnpike. On that podium would go a six- to seven-story base for both towers. That base would contain 33,000 square feet of retail, amenities, and lobbies as well as 303 parking spaces (we told you transit-oriented development wasn’t a real trend ). Nothing is decided yet re: 1000 Boylston, though the proposal is among several others that also hinge on building over the Turnpike . In fact, the snazzy rendering above from Weiner Ventures shows other proposals such as the S-shaped Viola complex. Stay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:33:22.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
