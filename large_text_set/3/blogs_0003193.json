The Florida rapper is currently jailed and missing out on thousands of dollars in performance fees as his Back and Better Tour had to be canceled in light of his recent legal troubles. \nSo far, Kodak’s team canceled four scheduled performances that were to snag the rapper $50,000 per show, reports TMZ . Kodak doesn’t get his day in court until March 10 regarding the violations, and there’s the matter of the criminal sexual misconduct case in South Carolina still looming over him. \nTMZ adds that aside from the checks for performing, Kodak is also missing out on his expensive needs backstage. In his rider, the rapper demands an Xbox or PS4 gaming system complete with the Madden and NBA 2K sport game titles, a bottle of Patrón, 12 bottles of Perrier-Jouet and Golden Oreos. There’s also a demand for a dinner for 10 at each stop. \nKodak Black is currently being held without bond in a Fort Lauderdale jail.
