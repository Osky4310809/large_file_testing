A year ago, UCLA missed the NCAA tournament at 15-17. This season, the Bruins are a national powerhouse, in large part because of freshman point guard Lonzo Ball .\nWhen the Bruins are at their best, no team is more entertaining. They proved it on Friday with this sequence in their first round matchup against Kent State:\nThe underhand pass by Ball, the scoop pass to the trailer, the flush by T.J. Leaf.\nThe Miami Heat earned a nickname during the LeBron James and Dwyane Wade years: the “Flying Death Machine.” The Heat were amazing in transition and when they get out on the break you had no chance to stop them.\nThis UCLA team is basically the college basketball equivalent of that. LeBron would be proud.\nBruins basketball is a thing of beauty when it’s working like this. Let’s see how far they can go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T05:19:03.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
