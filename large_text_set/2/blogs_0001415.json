I started to notice it in high school.\" \nThe questions were part of an exercise during the second annual DFW Leadership Council Forum hosted by Highland Park High School's student council. More than 200 student council leaders from 20 high schools throughout North Texas came together on Wednesday at Southern Methodist University to discuss their perceptions of race. \nThe students were divided into random groups where they discussed and presented solutions to improve race relations within their communities. \nFor many, this included sharing personal stories of experiences with racism and discrimination. \nAshenafi recalled her life in Utah before her family moved to Frisco two years ago. \n\"They would make fun of me because I was the only black student at my school,\" she said. \"I was called the N-word, and because my parents are from Ethiopia they assumed that I came from a hut.\" \nShe decided to share her experiences with the group as a way for others to learn from them, she said. \n\"It's important to not judge a book by its cover,\" Ashenafi said. \nJohn Hinton, a special education teacher and the student council sponsor at Highland Park, said the council came up with the idea for the forum while brainstorming ways to better their community. \n\"We started thinking about recycling and others things that schools usually do,\" Hinton said. \"But we decided to push ourselves to come up with an idea.\" \nThe students ultimately decided to tackle race relations in the community. The forum was held at Highland Park High the first year, but it moved to SMU when twice as many schools responded to their invitation this year. \nThe council also created an initiative called \"Race to End Racism,\" which they hope will be picked up by others schools around the country, Hinton said. The students have created a website, several social media sites and a hashtag to help promote the forum's message. \nThe council plans to present the initiative during the Leadership Experience and Development (LEAD) Conference in Chicago on Feb. 10-12. \nMaddie Basso, the Highland Park student council president, said the initiative can help student leaders like herself better understand and help find a solution to racism and discrimination in the U.S., even though the conversations can at times be uncomfortable. \n\"I learned that we really all have to step out of our comfort zones,\" Basso said. \"You're sitting there with nine other student council members you've never met before, but it's about breaking that barrier and connecting with each other and discussing uncomfortable topics that are relevant.\" \nOmar Lozano, a junior at Irving High School, sat across from Ashenafi as he shared an instance when his mother was discriminated against. He told his peers that his mother had been scolded for ordering food at a barbecue restaurant in Spanish by a man she didn't know. \nSome of the teens gasped in awe, and others shook their heads. \n\"I felt that was very rude,\" Lozano, 16, later said. \"Telling someone to speak only English gives the false narrative that Americans are all one race of people without any diversity. \" \nSeveral campus police officers also joined the student discussions. Allison Alexanders, who teaches law enforcement in Prosper and has been a police officer for 10 years, said she hoped to take the feedback from the students at the forum and share it with her students. \n\"It's happenstance that I'm on the cultural diversity unit,\" Alexanders said. \"People are really uncomfortable to talk about what's going on, but we have to talk about it.\" \nAfter the students finished answering their questionnaires, they were assigned to come up with solutions to the problems they had brought up in conversation. Some groups suggested developing games that would help students get to learn about others who are different from them, or diversity classes and festivals at their high schools. \nShajia Awan, a senior at W.T. White in Dallas, said her group agreed on educating those who may say something offensive, even if it's one of their friends. \n\"Racism stems from ignorance,\" Awan said. \"We have to educate those around us in order to become part of the change.\" More than twenty area schools attend the DFW Student Council Leadership Forum, hosted by Highland Park High School's student council. The second annual forum was held at Southern Methodist University campus in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, February 1, 2017.

(Allison Slomowitz/ Special Contributor) Special Contributor \nThe students also went outside, where they were encouraged to talk and shake hands with strangers, as part of the \"Race for Change\" campaign activity. \nFormer state Rep. Scott Turner ended the forum by encouraging students to take a stand against racism and discrimination, and to not be discouraged when no one else stands up for what is right. \n\"Real leaders lead when no one is looking,\" Turner told the crowd. \"It takes great courage to step out and do what's right. And sometimes you are going to be the only one who's standing.\" \nGeorge Stewart, a Highland Park student council member, said he plans to take what he has learned and teach others how to be accepting of those who may be different. He also hopes others do the same. \n\"If each of us goes home and changes five people's perspectives, just imagine the change we could achieve,\" Stewart said.
