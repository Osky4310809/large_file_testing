I’ll call you tomorrow,” she said at the end of the best first date ever. And then you never heard from her again.\nYou’ve been “ghosted.” The term is used most often to describe a sudden end to a potential romance, though it keeps expanding in our lexicon. The New York Times has published half a dozen articles on the phenomenon in the last two years, from Charlize Theron ghosting Sean Penn to patients ghosting their doctors to a column just last week on friends ghosting friends.\nBut is ghosting new? People who’ve been ghosted certainly think it is.\nOf course, there’s nothing exactly novel about cutting off contact with someone. The current obsession with ghosting is likely related to the ongoing expansion of online dating. With people going on so many first dates, the likelihood of being ghosted, possibly repeatedly, increases.\nPlus, with so much interaction today done via a screen and not face to face, ghosting can seem like the more natural option to slide out of a not-quite-relationship.\nStan, 38, says he ghosts women regularly and thinks it’s the more humane way to date. He says that when he has made the mistake of verbally breaking up with women with whom he had only gone on one or two dates, they often get angry and hurl insults. He just doesn’t think it’s worth it.\nMost of the articles on ghosting accept the premise that it is, by its very nature, rude. But it really isn’t. We’re living in an age where people love to over-emote, over-share, over-discuss. We’re consciously uncoupling, having divorce parties, putting it all out there. Ghosting is more honest than all of that. It says, “I have nothing left to say to you. Move on.”\nIn Psychology Today , Dr. Jennice Vilhauer writes that ghosting can be damaging to the ghosted because they don’t know how to process it.\n“Ghosting gives you no cue for how to react,” according to Vilhauer. “It creates the ultimate scenario of ambiguity. Should you be worried? What if they are hurt and lying in a hospital bed somewhere? Should you be upset? Maybe they are just a little busy and will be calling you at any moment. You don’t know how to react because you don’t really know what has happened.”\nBut we do know what’s happened. Any adult understands that the silence isn’t without meaning. No one is forced to tell anyone that they’re going to be real busy at work or that they’re moving to Yemen.\nThere’s nothing fake about ghosting. You can process it however you need to.\nWith a ghoster, you get to pretend they died. There’s no better closure than that. Yes, it’s very sad, he was so young. There’s not some guy walking around who didn’t think you were good enough to be his forever person. No, there was a guy who was super into you and when you parted he was hit by a car and died on the way to the hospital. Mourn him briefly, then find another.\nS., a 30-year-old woman who prefers not to be named, disagrees: “It’s no longer ‘it’s not you, it’s me,’ and that’s OK. Everyone is going on so many dates, with access to all these sites and apps, that there is an understanding that you won’t be everyone’s type.”\nShe said it doesn’t require a big sit-down, just a few words of closure. S. has ghosted men before, but since being ghosted after what she considered an amazing first date, she won’t do it again.\nMelissa, 38, says that ghosting used to make her crazy but now she’s partial to it, especially since becoming a single parent. “You see a guy isn’t worth your time faster this way, and it’s preferable because you don’t have much time to waste anyway.”\nWhat’s next? Well, New York Magazine declared something called “benching” to be the “new” ghosting while Cosmopolitan went with a similar-sounding “breadcrumbing” as ghosting’s up-and-coming replacement. These terms mean someone keeping you on the hook while they explore their options. So, look out, I guess.\nDating shouldn’t be so difficult. It’s supposed to be a fun thing that you do while you look for someone to settle down with, not something you struggle through under duress.\nIf you need buzzwords to describe what someone is doing to you, that’s not the person for you. Set your boundaries and find someone who works around them. Be grateful to the ghoster for not wasting more of your time.\nIt’s not you, he’s dead.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T03:00:59.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
