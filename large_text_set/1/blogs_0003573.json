Be it political (see: Brexit) or sartorial (London Fashion Week Men’s is poised to kick off tomorrow), the city is headed for a sizable cultural upheaval. But for Nigerian-born designer Duro Olowu , a resident of London for the past 25 years, the cobbled streets are familiar stomping grounds. A fixture on the British fashion and art scenes since opening up his Masons Yard shop—a bustling menagerie that has quickly become a hub for both stylish natives and visitors—the rakish creative knows the coolest haunts of the vast and diverse London scene. All of which makes him the perfect guide for those descending upon the city to take in the new season of menswear designs. \nFrom the best place to grab a cup of coffee in between appointments and the essential apothecary for English gents to the perfect London flea markets to find the most unique furniture and vintage fashion finds, Olowu shares his thoughts on the city as well as all the places you’ll want to hit up between shows. \nA True-Blue Londoner “I have lived in London for more than 25 years, and although I now divide my time between here and New York, its singularly unique and thriving multicultural community reminds us of what in the end history has taught us. That despite the recent surge in racist, Islamophobic, xenophobic, and homophobic rhetoric of politicians both here and all over the world, diversity and equality are huge benefits to any society. The tragedy of the recent Brexit vote was a great blow to Londoners and, I feel, a far cry from what most people in this city feel or represent.” \nWhen It Comes to Fashion, Look to Your Elders for Inspiration “London style is rather unique and always ahead in many ways. An interesting and international mix of sharply cut classic tailoring with edgy experimental details. I constantly look to people in their 70s and older for style inspiration. The effort they make with the way they dress on a daily basis is very uplifting.” \nMenswear Essentials for the London Gentleman “All London men need a Depara zigzag knit scarf by Grace Wales Bonner. It is luxuriously extra-long and chic. Navy V-neck merino cardigans from Uniqlo are a wardrobe staple for me, and knee-length fine-wool socks from Turnbull & Asser are an elegant way to stay warm.” Expand Photographed by Sebastian Kim, Vogue , March 2016 \nGrace Wales Bonner Is the Never-Miss Show “It’s a very busy time for me in preparation for women’s London Fashion Week in February, so I tend to go to no more than two shows, but I always look forward to the magical Grace Wales Bonner show. She is an exceptional and thoughtful designer who fuses her deep interest in black history, contemporary art, and British and international styles to create somewhat unisex, impeccable menswear with intricate and luxurious details.” \nFavorite Neighborhood “Golborne Road. I live around the corner from it and love its multicultural (West Indian, Moroccan, Portuguese, Spanish), energetic vibe. It’s changing fast and becoming gentrified, but still has some of its original unique qualities. On Friday afternoons, lunch of grilled fish, rice, and salad at one of the outdoor Moroccan food stands is a must.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:26:41.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
