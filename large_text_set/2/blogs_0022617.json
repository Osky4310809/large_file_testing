It would be terrible to mistakenly think that someone was replying \"good\" in response to a phone being stolen, when in fact they were expressing surprise! • Acknowledgement -- I See, I Understand \nWhen achha is said in a neutral tone at intervals during a conversation, it’s a way of acknowledging what the other person is saying. “I’m late for work today because I had so many problems along the way”. “Achha”. “Firstly, I left my wallet at home.” “Achha”. “After I went home and got it, I missed my train”. “Achha”. • Agreement -- Okay \nWhen achha is repeated in quick succession during a conversation, it means that the person is agreeing with what’s being said. In this situation, \" achha \" sounds more like “achhchhachha”. “I’’ll be in the city next week and we should catch up. How about we go to dinner and see a movie? I can meet you at 7 p.m.” “Achhchhachha” (Okay, okay). \nNote that Indians have a habit of repeating words to add emphasis to them. More often than not, when okay is said in agreement to something, it will be said not once but two or three times in a row! You can add a head wobble for further agreement and effect. • Question -- Listen up \nYou’ll also hear achha said in a rising tone of voice at the start of a sentence as a way of attracting someone’s attention, particularly when a question is to follow or some information is being sought. “ Achha , so tell me…” (Listen up, tell me…). • Exclamation -- Oh! Well, Well! \nIn addition, achha can be used at the beginning of a sentence in a falling tone of voice as a sign of exclamation and reproof. “ Achha! You’re still sleeping.” (Oh! You’re still sleeping, you should be out of bed by now). “ Achha! Today’s your birthday”. (Well, well! Today’s your birthday, why didn’t you say so).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:24.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
