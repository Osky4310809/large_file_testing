Winger Jakub Voracek (minus-27) and defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere (minus-25) rank second and third for the Eastern Conference’s lowest plus/minus rating. \n— Minnesota’s penalty kill ranks fifth in the league over the last month at 86.8 percent. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:38:36.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
