New companies are even popping up to help fill the gaps. A couple weeks ago, Stellar launched at Sephora to help provide foundations to those with medium skin tones. Mented Cosmetics, on the other hand, creates nude lipsticks for deeper skin tones. Its founders KJ Miller and Amanda E. Johnson, who met at Harvard Business school, personally know how hard it can be to find the perfect nude lipstick. For years, they found themselves searching for ones at beauty counters but coming up short. \"It felt as if the products weren't made for us in mind,\" they tell Allure . \"We started Mented because we believe every woman should be able to find herself in the world of beauty.
