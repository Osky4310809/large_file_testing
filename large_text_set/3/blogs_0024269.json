But it has now said it’s grounded its entire autonomous fleet — so also in the two other regions where it is currently piloting the self-driving cars: Pittsburg and San Francisco. \n“Our vehicles in Arizona remain grounded while we continue our investigation. Our vehicles are grounded in Pittsburgh and SF today as well,” an Uber spokeswoman told us. \nFour hours ago the same spokeswoman told us the fleet was grounded in Arizona but did not mention the other two locations so it appears the company has decided to expand the suspension in the past few hours. \nThe spokeswoman confirmed that the Arizona grounding will last as long as the duration of the investigation into the crash but added that the wider suspension does not have a set timing — so it’s not clear how long all self-driving Ubers will be parked. Presumably at least for the rest of today. \nAlthough Uber pulled the autonomous vehicles out of SF last December , after a dispute with local regulators, a smaller fleet returned to California’s roads earlier this month — after it was granted a permit to test two self-driving cars. \nIn Phoenix and Pittsburg Uber has been testing 12 cars apiece. All its test cars include a human driver sitting in the driver’s seat so they are in a position to take over driving the vehicle should that be necessary. \nIn the Arizona incident, in which no one has been reported seriously injured, the WSJ reports local police saying Uber’s technology was not responsible for the accident — instead a regular vehicle “failed to yield”. \nAs we noted earlier, the crash is just the latest in a string of bad news stories for Uber — including several related to its self-driving technology but also beyond that, with accusations the company has a problem with systemic sexism in its corporate culture. Which might explain why it’s taken the decision to err on the side of caution and ground all its autonomous vehicles, despite the tech not being accused of culpability for this particular incident. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:32:10.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
