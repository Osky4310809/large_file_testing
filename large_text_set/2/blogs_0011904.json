Or a weak one? \nSo he made a call ― except not to any of the business leaders Trump brought into his administration or even to an old friend from his days in real estate. Instead, he called his national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, according to two sources familiar with Flynn’s accounts of the incident. \nFlynn has a long record in counterintelligence but not in macroeconomics. And he told Trump he didn’t know, that it wasn’t his area of expertise, that, perhaps, Trump should ask an economist instead. \nThis is Donald J. Trump here, self-proclaimed business genius and so-called president, having no effing clue about, you know, money , and dialing up his national security advisor—a disgraced Army officer who was pushed out of the Defense Intelligence Agency for being an unhinged prat—at 3 o’clock in the morning (in his bathrobe?) seeking advice on matters economic. \nEven for Trump, that rates a serious fucking “wow.” At least Flynn had the good sense to demur, but that response, according to the Huffington Post, still pissed off the “POTUS.” And there’s an even scarier thought: an enraged, befuddled commander-in-chief, alone in the middle of the night, unable to figure out how dollars work, looking for a suitable target for his ire. Next time he gets spurned after a midnight drunk-dial, who knows how he’ll react? \nWant to do something about this maniac? It starts with winning seats back in the House, and that means chipping in a few bucks to Democrat Jon Ossoff , running in a winnable special election that’s coming up soon in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:34:32.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
