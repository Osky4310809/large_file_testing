That’s not a popular move at any football match, let alone El Tractico where both teams were desperate to win. \nIn the end the game ended in a 1-1 draw, but by the look of some Twitter reaction, peoples’ love for Sheeran transcends his indiscretion. Maybe he won’t need to trek up to that “Castle on the Hill” after all. — Luca Liberti (@LucaLibz) February 26, 2017 ED SHEERAN 💙💙💙 of course he's an Ipswich fan 🚜🙌🏼 — Natasha Mann (@TashaItfc91) February 26, 2017 Typical, you finally get a chance to get a selfie with two NCFC legends, and an Ipswich fan photo bombs you... @adamdrury78 @Grantholt31 pic.twitter.com/pY3aRdhaJ0 — Andy Cossey (@AndyCossey) February 26, 2017 \nSPEAKING OF MISTAKES IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP... \nHow about this blunder regarding Massimo Luongo’s Queens Park Rangers. \nTheir Championship opponents Preston North End accidentally printed a Birmingham crest on the teamsheet where QPR’s should have been. \nHowever, it didn’t infuriate the Socceroo’s team enough as they went on to lose 2-1. — Ian Taylor 📲🎙⚽️ (@IJTaylor81) February 25, 2017 @IJTaylor81 So why have PNE given QPR the Birmingham crest? — Lager Lout (@lagerlout1966) February 25, 2017 \nBUT NOT AS EMBARRASSING AS YAKUBU \nSure, the 34-year-old former Everton striker is now playing for Coventry in League One, but that doesn’t mean he has an excuse for doing absolutely nothing. \nDuring the 3-1 loss to Swindon Town, he was videoed for a full two and half minutes by a fan during the match doing exactly that. Here's Yakubu not doing anything for 2 & 1/2 mins. He was the closest outfield player to Burge (our GK) during a City attack in this period pic.twitter.com/XxgoIiiRD8 — CJ Joiner (@CJ_covblaze) February 25, 2017 \nWORLD’S OLDEST PRO FOOTBALLER \nYakubu is still in his 30s so he has no excuse when you consider Kazuyoshi Miura’s effort. \nHe celebrated his 50th birthday by starting a J-League game for Yokohama FC and playing 65 minutes in the 1-0 home win over second division rival Matsumoto Yamaga. \nHe’s the oldest Japanese played to partake in a professional football match and reportedly the world’s oldest pro player. \nHe was given a standing ovation from 13,000 fans when he was substituted and appeared in a pink suit for his post-match press conference where he was given a bunch of red roses and a birthday cake. \nBut Miura’s, who’s nickname is “King Kazu”, career is far from over. He recently resigned with Yokohama on a one-year deal that will see him play a 32nd season and extend his own record. Japanese legend Kazuyoshi Miura played on his 50th birthday yesterday 👏 pic.twitter.com/reHswO9BfK — UNILAD Football (@UNILADFooty) February 27, 2017 \nREFEREE’S TEASE HARRY KANE \nI wonder if “King Kazu” has ever had this problem. \nAfter Harry Kane became the first Tottenham player to ever score four Premier League hat-tricks, naturally he wanted to take the match-ball home. \nHowever, when the striker approached referee Jon Moss to accept the it, Moss hid it away from him and the official to his left said the third goal needed to go to the, “dubious goals panel!” \nThat’s because Kane completed his treble with a free kick that took a heavy deflection off Peter Crouch. \nBut the Englishman was not leaving without the ball! Refs tease 'dubious' Kane 0:29 \nEPL: The officials have some fun with Harry Kane following his hattrick performance against Stoke.
