The Economic Times first reported about the consortium’s deal with PSCSCL.\nWith Google Station, a program announced last year , Google is looking at bringing affordable and fast internet connectivity with the help of businesses, or individuals who have good internet connectivity. The company has plans to offer monetary benefits to its partners, Caesar Sengupta, VP of Google’s Next Billion Plan had mentioned last year.\nAccording to ET’s report, IBM will provide smart city solutions, while state-run ISP RailTel helps with last mile connectivity lines. The city will also have message displays to deliver information across 161 locations in the city.\nL&T also has partnership with the Maharashtra government to bring Wi-Fi at over planned 5,00 locations in Mumbai.\nBONUS: 10 years, 4 million YouTube followers – meet the internet's favourite mad scientist", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/3kMlE1K0.m3u8", "http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/technology/smart-city-mission-google-bags-first-city-wi-fi-deal-for-pune/57051743", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/3kMlE1K0.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-09T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:55:46.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
