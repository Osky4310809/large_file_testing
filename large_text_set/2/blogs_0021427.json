Thus, it is critical that we keep our data safe and secure from would-be thieves, whether it be through the use of a secure lockscreen method, keeping our phones up to date to avoid exploitation, and finally avoiding sending any important information over unsecured networks. \nUnfortunately, even if you yourself do your due diligence in keeping your private data safe, you can’t guarantee that other people you correspond with are doing the same. If another person’s e-mail account is hacked, how do you know that the person messaging you is actually them and not a malicious third-party? While you might be able to recognize obvious spam from a hacked account, more malicious, sophisticated attempts might be harder for you to detect. If your friends and family start using S/MIME certificates in their outgoing messages, you will know that it was them who actually sent the e-mail. Understanding S/MIME. (Credits: Microsoft) \nS/MIME is an enhanced level of e-mail encryption that is available on the web-based version of Gmail , and it is indicated by the green padlock symbol on messages. For a while, users of the Android app could only send messages over the default TLS encryption (enabled by default), but in version 7.2 of the Gmail application , it appears that support for sending messages with this enhanced S/MIME encryption may soon be supported . \nAlthough a teardown can provide valuable information regarding upcoming features, it is entirely possible that these features may not make their way into the final product. Do not take these teardowns as proof that a feature will be added, but rather as a hint of what could be coming. Enhanced Encryption with Gmail \nHidden within the APK file of the latest Gmail update are a bunch of strings that clearly point to the inclusion of S/MIME encryption support.

This will be shown by the aforementioned green padlock icon, similar to what is shown on the desktop Gmail. When you first send an enhanced encryption message, you will see a dialog letting you know that S/MIME is being used. If your certificate is invalid, expired, or revoked, you will also be notified of this. For now, private keys will still have to be uploaded by your network administrator on the desktop Gmail app. \nA couple of new layout files have also been added in this update, which rule how this feature will be implemented in the app. They are fz_details.xml, fz_failure.xml, fz_details_item.xml, fz_details_divider.xml, and fz_failure_background.xml .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:42:25.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
