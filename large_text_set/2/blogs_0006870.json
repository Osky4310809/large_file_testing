Two clean sheets in a row is really important for us. We have the quality to give more and play better. \n\"We have had a good week of preparation ahead of Arsenal. We need to continue to do our work. \n\"I want my players to keep their feet on the ground. We have won nothing yet and the hard work must continue.\" \nSilva will be without Michael Dawson and Abel Hernandez for the match, although Ahmed Elmohamady is back after helping Egypt to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations. \nHe said: \"Michael is out with a calf injury – maybe for a few weeks. Abel is out with a hamstring muscle injury. \n\"Elmohamady is back with us now after international duty and available for Saturday. He is an important player for us – he knows the club and competition well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:29:41.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
