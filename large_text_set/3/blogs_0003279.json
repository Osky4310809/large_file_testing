Following the drop in performance, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) had promised to go into a discussion with the 29-year-old and decide the future course of action. \nBangladesh team manager Khaled Mahmud confirmed on Thursday (March 2) that Rahim would play in the upcoming two-match Test series against Sri Lanka as a specialist batsman, handing over the wicketkeeping duties to young Liton Das. Das, 22, has featured in just three Tests thus far, having made his debut against India in 2015. \n\"The coach [Chandika Hathurusingha] and I have informed Mushfiqur officially [that he will play only as a batsman],\" Mahmud told the Bengali daily Prothom Alo. \"He is the best batsman in the team. He is in such form that we believe he will be able to give more to the team, which is why he will bat at No. 4 and will not be keeping wickets. Mushfiqur has taken the decision positively, which is the best part. \n\"We gave him examples of Kumar Sangakkara and Brendan Taylor whose batting improved as soon as they gave up wicketkeeping in Tests. It is hard to play as wicketkeeper, captain and batsman,\" Mahmud added. \nMushfiqur is not new to the idea of shedding gloves, with the senior pro having played as a specialist batsman in the 2016 Asia Cup, while Nurul Hasan kept wickets. However, this change in role would mean that Liton gets a spot in the eleven and the team management would have to ponder dropping either Mahmudullah or Sabbir Rahman from the starting lineup. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T11:18:16.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
