That is hard to imagine for a movie about a dog who dies over and over and over again. But then, Marley and Me made $250 million worldwide a few years ago, so there’s apparently a huge appetite for movies with dogs who die. The thing about most moviegoers, however, is that while they love a good dog death on a movie screen (see also Old Yeller , John Wick ), the idea that any animal was hurt during filming is a huge turn-off, so the controversy surrounding A Dog’s Purpose after a dog was mistreated on set while shooting the film may have hurt its box-office prospects. The film ultimately opened this weekend with roughly $18 million, which is below expectations, but still an insane figure for what I can only describe as dog snuff film . It might have helped the film, however, after the author of the bestseller upon which the film is based, Gavin Pollone, spoke out against the mistreatment of a dog , sharing similar concerns as others who saw the video. \nIn either respect, $18 million is not bad for a film that only cost $22 million to produce. Dog films tend to have decent box-office legs, and with an A Cinemascore, A Dog’s Purpose might have another weekend of good grosses in it before LEGO Batman comes along and puts the film out of its box-office misery, much like the movie did to the dog at the center of the film over and over and over again. \nThe $18 million gross was not enough, however, to topple M. Night Shyamalan’s Split in its second weekend. In fact, Shyamalan’s Split had a remarkable hold for a horror film, probably due to curiosity over the twist ending, which sets up an exciting future prospect for the series . The film made around $25 million (falling only 35 percent) in its second weekend and it’s closing in on $80 million cumulative, which is exceptional for a movie that cost less than $10 million to produce. In ten days, Split has already exceeded the entire domestic box-office runs of Shyamalan’s last two films, The Visit and After Earth . \nThird place this weekend goes to Hidden Figures , which continues to coast along after three Oscar nominations. The film added another $13 million and crossed the $100 million mark. It may stick around in the top ten for another couple of months. \n\nSony\nIn at fourth place is Resident Evil: The Final Chapter , the final installment in a six-movie franchise that has unbelievably crossed $1 billion in box-office receipts. The final film, however, was something of a dud. It looks like it will end the weekend with something around $13.8 million, which is the worst opening weekend of the series’ run (the last film, 2012’s Retribution , opened with $21 million). It’s hard to say whether the fact that a stuntwoman almost died on set hurt the film’s prospects, but I did see plenty of people bring it up on social media this weekend. \nFortunately for Sony, however, American audiences are not depended upon to make Resident Evil movies a success. American audiences, after all, only contributed 17 percent of the eventual $240 million haul for Retribution . After worldwide grosses are accounted for, expect The Final Chapter to easily clear its $40 million price tag. Nevertheless, Sony had to be disappointed with the domestic take (and the reviews for the film, which have been dismal . \nSlots five through nine all went to holdovers this weekend. La La Land continues its consistent performance, adding around $11 million and bringing its overall total to $106 million. xXx: The Return Xander Cage , which had a disappointing opening weekend last week, continues to stumble, dropping nearly 70 percent to come in at number six, with around $32 million cumulative. Sing is hanging in there (and should for another two weeks, before LEGO Batman steals all of its screens), adding $6 million to bring its total to nearly $260 million. Rogue One added $5 million (it’s now made $520 million domestic), and in at number nine, Monster Trucks added $4 million. Its box-office total is $28 million, well short of its $125 million price tag, making it one of the biggest flops in recent memory. (The $20 million it has added worldwide isn’t helping much.)\nWeinstein\n\nSpeaking of flops, Matthew McConaughey has turned in another. Gold , like Michael Keaton’s The Founder , was supposed to compete for Oscars this season. Despite strong performances from their leads, both movies have performed terribly. That’s a bigger disappointment for The Founder , which is actually a terrific movie (it came in at number 11 in its second weekend with $2.5 million). Gold meanwhile, features a strong McConaughey performance, but not even McConaughey could save the movie. It’s not a very good film , and it’s McConaughey’s third live-action dud in a row after Free State of Jones and Gus Van Sant’s The Sea of Trees , which made only $20,000 despite opening in 100 theaters. We probably could have predicted Gold’s failure after the Weinsteins moved it off its original Christmas Day release. I wouldn’t worry too much about McConaughey, however. He should bounce back nicely with The Dark Tower , which opens this summer. \nNext weekend has only two wide releases lined up: Rings , the reboot of the horror franchise, and The Space Between Us , an Asa Butterfield film about the first human born on Mars who travels to Earth for the first time.\nSource: Box Office Mojo , Deadline \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T19:00:17.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
