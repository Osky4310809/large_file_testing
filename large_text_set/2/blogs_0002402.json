We don't know who'll win the game, but we do know this means \"Grimm\" fans will again have to be patient. \nLast time the Blazers bumped \"Grimm\" out of the Friday berth, the show aired in the wee, small hours of Saturday morning. So when will we find out what happens in the fifth episode of the sixth and final \"Grimm\" season? \nRelax. This week's \"Grimm\" episode airs at the reasonable hour of 8 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 4. The episode's title is \"The Seven Year Itch,\" but it doesn't sound like it has anything to do with the movie that starred Marilyn Monroe. \nNope, there's another new case involving a murder in a Portland park. While Nick (David Giuntoli), Hank (Russell Hornsby) and Wu (Reggie Lee) are investigating, Captain Renard (Sasha Roiz) is still having ghostly visions. \nAs usual, I'll be sharing my thoughts about the episode right here at Oregonlive, on Saturday night after the episode airs. Come on back and weigh in with what you think after watching. \nOh, and \"Emerald City\" fans, this week's episode will also be bumped on Friday by the Blazers game. The new \"Emerald City\" episode will instead air at 9 p.m. Saturday, right after \"Grimm.\" \n-- Kristi Turnquist", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:27:32.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
