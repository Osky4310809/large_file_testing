Media | Brand | Lifestyle | Entertainment Columnist --- Shares February 23, 2017 \nIn this video, Entrepreneur Network partner Bryan Elliott meets with bestselling author Seth Godin to discuss the importance of understanding your customers and realizing when it's time to test a business idea. \n\"You will never be ready,\" Godin says. \"You should be prepared, but you will never be ready. Because what it means to be 'ready' is that it [your business idea] is going to work. When Gutenberg launched the printing press . . . 94 percent of the people in Europe were illiterate. So, it was a stupid time to launch the printing press. \n\"When Carl Benz launched the car, it was against a lot of laws, there were no roads and no gas stations.
