It was a little sad. It took away from the glamour of the Oscars. It didn't feel like a very glamorous evening. I've been to the Oscars. There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad.\" \nTo wit, the night was filled with politically charged moments: Host Jimmy Kimmel jokingly echoed trump to call actress Meryl Streep \"underwhelming,\" \"mediocre\" and \"lackluster.\" Streep drew Trump's ire earlier this award season when she called out his treatment of a disabled reporter/ Kimmel also tweeted at the president \"u up\" and \"#Merylsayshi\" And he reminded us about last year, when it \"seemed like the Oscars were racist\" On the more serious front, after winning an Oscar for best foreign film, Iranian filmmaker Asghar Fahadi had a statement read on his behalf that denounced the president's temporary travel ban on seven Muslim majority countries Actor Gael Garcia Bernal: \"As a Mexican, as a Latin American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, Iâ€™m against any form of walls that wants to separate us.\" \nBreitbart's take on it all: \"The president has got the last laugh as he hammers Hollywood for its epic fail.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2mxvL4a Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:50:14.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
