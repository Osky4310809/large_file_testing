But this time they didn’t get a response from the president, much to the chagrin of the actors. \n“You know, we’re more than two hours into the show and Donald Trump hasn’t tweeted at us once,” Kimmel said during the live broadcast Sunday. “And I’m starting to get worried about him.” \nAfter all, Trump is the same man who bashed actress Meryl Streep last month as “overrated” after she went on an anti-Trump tirade while accepting an award at the Golden Globes. \nAnd even though Trump remained quiet on his personal Twitter account late Sunday, that didn’t stop Kimmel from “poking the bear” during the awards show. \n“Hey @realDonaldTrump u up?” Kimmel tweeted at Trump during the show.
