Live blog: FA Cup third round \nIn the last of his 758 recognised appearances for United in April 1973, Charlton had 249 goals, although he went on to play in the Anglo-Italian Cup a week later against Verona, scoring two goals. \nThe game was an official game organised between the Football Association, the Italian FA and Uefa, but the goals, and the appearance, is not recognised by United as it was not considered a ‘first-class game competition’. \nUnited insist Charlton’s last-ever game was the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea, and not the game against Verona. \nDespite this, the yellow cards picked up in the fixture contributed towards suspensions for players, leading many to claim the goals should also stand. \nTherefore Charlton actually scored 251 goals for United, and not the 249 officially recognised, leaving it up for debate whether Rooney is actually the club’s joint all-time record goalscorer. \nBut in the club’s eyes, and record books, no player has scored more goals for Manchester United that Rooney.
