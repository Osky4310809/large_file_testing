It's filled with flowers in spring and snow in winter. Pretty Kashmiri villages with traditional wooden houses and colorful rooftops can be seen along the way. These popular tourist places in Kashmir are good starting points. \nThe easiest way of getting around is to hire a car and driver. Your hotel or houseboat owner will be able to readily arrange tours. Otherwise, if you're on a budget, the state bus company runs day trips. Tickets can be booked from the Tourist Reception Center in Srinagar. Another option is this 5 Day Kashmir Valley Tour from Srinagar offered by Viator. 1. Sonamarg \nScenic Sonamarg (\"Meadow of Gold\") is famous for its Thajiwas Glacier. What's remarkable about this glacier is how accessible it is. From the highway, you can hike up to the glacier and back in around five hours. If you don't have so much time to spare, it's possible to ride a pony instead, or take a shared taxi part of the way there. Scenes of many Bollywood movies have been filmed in the area, and you won't have to try very hard to feel like you're in one! There are a number of options for eating and staying at Sonamarg. Ahsan Mount Resort has fabulous Swiss tents for glamping. Hotel Snowland is conveniently positioned but could be managed better. Location: On the Srinagar-Ladakh Highway, 2.5 hours northeast of Srinagar. Travel Tips: Be aware of aggressive local touts, pony owners, and taxi drivers who try to exploit tourists. They quote really high prices, especially during peak season. Do bargain hard. The Tourist Reception Center opposite the main market in Sonamarg is the best place to get information and approved taxi rates. Visit from mid-April to June if you want to go there for the snow. \ncontinue reading below our video Before Your Road Trip, Watch This The gondola in Gulmarg, Kashmir. Julian Love/Getty Images 2. Gulmarg \nGulmarg (\"Meadow of Flowers\") is India's version of a ski resort. If you're not into skiing, you may still want to let the gondola whisk you more than 13,000 feet up Mount Apharwat for outstanding views. Apparently, it's the world's highest cable car. Ubiquitous pony rides are available in Gulmarg as well, and their owners are also aggressive in pestering tourists for business. If you feel like splashing some cash, treat yourself to a couple of nights at the Khyber Himalayan Resort and Spa , one of the 12 Top Himalayan Spa Resorts . Location: Less than 2 hours east of Srinagar. Travel Tips: The ski season runs from mid December to mid March. The gondola is very popular, so do buy your tickets online to avoid a long queues. Unfortunately, you'll still have to wait to board it though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:58:41.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
