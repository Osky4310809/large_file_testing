For Joseph, they will have to wait until next week since the Dolphins face the Steelers in a wild-card game Sunday. If Miami wins Sunday, the Broncos will have to interview him in Miami. If the Dolphins are eliminated, they can do it here. Tags: January 03, 2017, 7:52 pm   Jhabvala vs. Kiz: Is Kyle Shanahan the right fit as Broncos head coach?
