Or do you think some of this is circumstantial? \nJAMES CLAPPER: \nWell, I can't say what the nature of those conversations and dialogues were, for the most part. Again, I'd think it would be very healthy to completely clear the air on this subject. And I think it would be in everyone's interest to have that done. \nCHUCK TODD: \nCan the Senate Intelligence Committee-- what are we going to learn from their investigation, do you think, that will move beyond what you were able to do? \nJAMES CLAPPER: \nWell, I think they can look at this from a broader context than we could. And at this point, I do have confidence in the Senate intelligence Committee and their effort. It is underway, in contrast to the House Intelligence Committee, which just last week agreed on their charter. \nAnd importantly, in the case of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this appears to me to be a truly bipartisan effort. And so I think that needs to play out. If, for some reason, that proves not to be satisfactory in the minds of those who make those decisions, then perhaps then move on to a special prosecutor. \nCHUCK TODD: \nThe New York Times, earlier this week, and as I was introducing you, this idea that they sort of left a trail, maybe lowered classif-- can you walk us through how that would work? Did they lower classification levels on certain information? Was that a fair read of what was done in the last few weeks of the administration? \nJAMES CLAPPER: \nActually not. Because of the sensitivity of much of the information in this report, our actual effort was to protect it and not to spread it around, and certainly not to dumb it down, if I can use that phrase, in order to disseminate it more widely. We were under a preservation order from both our oversight committees to preserve and protect all the information related to that report, in any event. \nCHUCK TODD: \nLet me ask you one other final question on the infamous dossier that was put together by this former British operative named Christopher Steele. Why did you feel the need to brief the president on that at the time? \nJAMES CLAPPER: \nWe felt that it was important that he know about it, that it was out there. And that, without respect to the veracity of the contents of the dossier, that's why it was not included as a part of our report. Because much of it could not be corroborated. And importantly, some of the sources that Mr. Steele drew on, second and third order assets, we could not validate or corroborate. \nSo for that reason, at least in my view, the important thing was to warn the president that this thing was out there. The Russians have a term, an acronym, called Kompromat, which they will either generate, if it's truthful or if it's contrived. And it's important, we felt, that he knew of the existence of this dossier. \nCHUCK TODD: \nHave you done this with other presidents? Have you had to brief them about unverified intelligence? \nJAMES CLAPPER: \nYes, I've had occasion in the six and a half years I was DNI to tell President Obama certain things that we could not corroborate or validate, but that we just thought he ought to know it was out there. \nCHUCK TODD: \nAll right. James Clapper, I have a feeling-- do you expect to have to testify on Capitol Hill among these things? \nJAMES CLAPPER: \nOh, I don't think there's any doubt. \nCHUCK TODD: \nAll right. Mr. Clapper, then I have a feeling we will see you on T.V. some time soon. And hopefully you'll come back here on Meet the Press. Thanks for coming on and sharing your views, sir. \nJAMES CLAPPER:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:48:58.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
