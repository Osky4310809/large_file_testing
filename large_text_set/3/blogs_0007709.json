Instead of showing his image or his tweets, the account blocked his profile image and included a caution: “This profile may include potentially sensitive content.” \nThe reporter could still ultimately view the account, but only by clicking that he agreed to continue despite the possibility of seeing “sensitive images or language.” \nIs this new? Hard to say. Twitter asks that users tweeting images containing violence or nudity flag that in settings. And while users have long been able to request specific media be marked as sensitive in Twitter’s safety settings, account-level warnings like this are unusual. \nThe move stands out among Twitter’s latest anti-abuse measures, however, not least because it doesn’t appear to have notified Warren of his new status. When told by Mashable , he said he had no idea his account was “sensitive.” @arielbogle No, I didn’t, but now I do. Probably because Americans struggle with swearing as punctuation. \n— Justin Warren (@jpwarren) March 9, 2017 \nAmong the programs Twitter has introduced in 2017 is a function that removes tweets containing “potentially sensitive content” from search results. \nIt’s also rolled out a 12-hour time out for accounts it believes are engaged in abusive behaviour, but it does notify users if they’ve been hit with the red card. In the case of the 12-hour suspension, accounts are detected by patterns of behaviour and not just potentially offensive keywords. \nIt’s unclear why Warren’s account, where he tweets regularly about technology policy, would be marked sensitive. \nThe issue doesn’t seem widespread, but a number of other accounts seem to have noticed it within the past eight hours. Nevertheless, it’s doubtful putting a sensitive filter over people’s profiles without letting them know will prove popular in the long run. \nAs spokesperson from Twitter confirmed the platform is running a “limited test of a new safety feature.” Holy crap, I just encountered an account that has the “Caution: This profile may include potentially sensitive content” warning on it \n— Joe Schmoe (@FilthyDumbGamer) March 9, 2017 \nUPDATE: March 10, 2017, 9:57 a.m. AEDT Comment from Twitter added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:47:23.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
