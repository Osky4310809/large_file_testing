I’m going with my secretary because I think [Mike] Pompeo ’s gonna be phenomenal. I’m gonna go with what they say.” \nMattis and Pompeo are Trump’s Secretary of Defense and CIA Director respectively. Both have made statements in the past which suggest that they are not as in favor of waterboarding as Trump is. \nTrump went on to say that he talked with intelligence leaders who told him that waterboarding and other torture does work. Trump repeated that he would consider what his advisers recommend, but as for his personal opinion, Trump said “absolutely I feel it works.” \nThe full interview will premiere tonight on ABC at 10:00 p.m. EST. \nWatch above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:04:42.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
