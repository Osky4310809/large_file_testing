Today the company announced that it would pay $3.3 billion in cash to acquire the Fortress Investment Group , an asset manager and investor in its own right , with significant holdings in Lyft, ZestFinance, Xapo, Jawbone and other tech companies. \nThis is SoftBank’s second dalliance with Fortress, in a sense. Recently, SoftBank committed $100 billion to a new investment endeavor called the Vision Fund (which includes Apple as a $1 billion backer ): the Vision Fund is run by Rajeev Misra, who joined from Fortress. \nThe news comes after reports of a possible acquisition emerged this week. \nThe deal introduces a new chapter into the ongoing story of Softbank’s larger investment strategy — which changed under the leadership of Nikesh Arora to focus much more aggressively on investing in tech companies, but appeared to be changing tack again and slowing down investments after Arora’s depature and SoftBank’s big purchase of ARM in the UK for $24 billion . \nSoftBank’s CEO Masayoshi Son said that it would run the business independently, led by existing Fortress principles Pete Briger, Wes Edens and Randy Nardone, but that it would also be working “alongside” the Vision Fund. \n“Fortress’s excellent track record speaks for itself, and we look forward to benefitting from its leadership, broad-based expertise and world-class investment platform,” said Son in a statement. “For SoftBank, this opportunity will immediately help expand our group capabilities, and, alongside our soon-to-be-established SoftBank Vision Fund platform, will accelerate our SoftBank 2.0 transformation strategy of bold, disciplined investment and world class execution to drive sustainable long-term growth.” \n“SoftBank is an extraordinary company that has thrived under the visionary leadership of Masayoshi Son,” said Fortress Co-Chairmen Pete Briger and Wes Edens in a statement. “We are very pleased to announce an agreement setting our business on a great path forward as part of SoftBank, while creating significant value for our shareholders. We join a company with tremendous scale and resources, and a culture completely aligned with our focus on performance, service and innovation. We anticipate substantial benefits for our investors and business as a whole, and we have never been more optimistic about our prospects going forward.” \nSoftBank said the deal has been unanimously approved by a Special Committee of Independent Directors of Fortress’s Board of Directors and Fortress’s full Board of Directors. Each Fortress Class A shareholder will receive $8.08 per share, which represents a premium of 38.6% to the closing price of Fortress Class A common stock on February 13, 2017, and a premium of 51.2% to Fortress’s 3-month volume-weighted average price, excluding dividends. In addition, each Fortress Class A shareholder may receive up to two regular quarterly dividends prior to the closing, each in an amount not to exceed $0.09 per Class A Share. Fortress plans to maintain its current base dividend of $0.09 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 and, if closing does not occur prior to the applicable payment date, for the first quarter of 2017.
