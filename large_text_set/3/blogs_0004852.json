Bogaerts didn’t wait long to make his impact: In his first at-bat, the Aruba native smacked a hard grounder down the first base line and slid head-first into third base for a triple. Your browser does not support iframes. \nIt was Bogaerts’ only hit of the day — he finished 1-for-4 with one runner stranded — but the Netherlands cruised to a 5-0 win over Korea. \nMonday’s game also marked Bogaerts’ debut at third base, as the Los Angeles Angels’ Andrelton Simmons got the start at shortstop. Bogaerts hasn’t played third since 2014 but was willing to make the switch in a stacked Dutch infield that also includes Jonathan Schoop and Didi Gregorious. \nHe held down the hot corner pretty well, making a nice stab on a grounder in the sixth to start a double play.
