Advertisement \nFor the issue (which has three models of color on the cover, nice), Allure commissioned 41 women to “tell us the story of their lives through their skin—and skin tone.” Many of the anecdotes are deeply traumatic memories from executives, fashion insiders, actors, etc., and it’s well worth a read. Aja Naomi King, from How to Get Away With Murder , recalls how kids at her school were shocked that her skin could tan and that their comments made her avoid sunlight. “I was afraid of the darkness of my skin. I believed I had to be celebrated for my intelligence and my sense of humor,” she says. “Those could be the beautiful things about me since my skin couldn’t.” \nEva Longoria talks about her Texas upbringing and Hollywood’s very slow diversity push (“I think there’s something that happened in which it’s become cool to have darker skin,” she says). And Dashca Polanco touches on the frustration of finding foundation for her skin tone (“You can see my African features, so I like to embrace these things as opposed to covering them”). Advertisement \nThough diversity can seem like mandatory programming for mainstream publications, this cover seems like part of a natural push for inclusion under Allure ’s editor-in-Chief Michelle Lee . (In Jezebel’s 2016 analysis of fashion magazine covers, Allure got an A- from me for its cover diversity.) \nA few more highlights below. \nTop Chef ’s Padma Lakshimi says she used to hate her skin tone: Sponsored \n“My skin is a map of my life. Before high school, I lived in a white suburb of Los Angeles where there were so few Indians that they didn’t even know the ‘correct’ slurs. They called me the N-word or ‘Blackie.’ For a long time I hated my skin color. Even in India, there’s a complicated history. My grandmother discouraged us from going in the sun; she didn’t want us to be dark. We were only allowed to play outside after 4:30. There was a cosmetics line called Fair & Lovely — that says it all. [And] when I started to work as a model, people would on occasion say things to me like ‘You’re so pretty for being an Indian.’” \nMarkle recalls losing her sense of belonging around outsiders: Advertisement \n“I took an African-American studies class at Northwestern where we explored colorism; it was the first time I could put a name to feeling too light in the black community, too mixed in the white community. For castings, I was labeled ‘ethnically ambiguous.’ Was I Latina? Sephardic? ‘Exotic Caucasian’? Add the freckles to the mix and it created quite the conundrum. To this day, my pet peeve is when my skin tone is changed and my freckles are airbrushed out of a photo shoot.” \nZazie Beetz remembers visits to her dad’s native Germany where black people were so scarce that she felt like a spectacle: \n“People would stare. They would say things like ‘Oh, you look like chocolate — I want to eat you up!’ I’ve been to gatherings where people would say, ‘She has so much race in her’ or would use the word ‘n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:31:49.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
