This is a man they adore so much, they have even created a banner celebrating the existence of his two dogs. \nBearing that in mind, the graph you can see below might take the worship of the chunky Chilean to dangerous levels of idolisation. \nWhy? Because it shows that Sanchez has created more chances this season than ANY OTHER footballer currently playing top flight football in Europe. \"BOO-YAH!\" (Photo: Stuart MacFarlane) \nThe Gooner love-in for the former Barcelona man is normally based on his goalscoring exploits. His delightfully cheeky 97th minute Panenka penalty that gave them a 2-1 win against Burnley, his vital equaliser in the 1-1 draw at PSG, the amazing dummy and chip which made West Ham keeper Darren Randolph look very silly… there are plenty of sensational Sanchez strikes which have had Gooners everywhere quivering with delight. \nHowever, while Sanchez is seen as a goalscorer, Mesut Ozil is often considered to be the Gunners' most creative player. Ask an Arsenal fan which player creates most chances for his team mates, and they will probably choose the German Assist King. \"So, you give me the ball, and I'll do the rest. Cool?\" (Photo: David Price) \nThis chart shows why that assumption is not only wrong - it is SPECTACULARLY wrong. \nAlexis has created a remarkable 58 goalscoring opportunities from open play so far this season, more than other Arsenal player. But just how look how that compares to the same figure for EVERY OTHER PLAYER from the top flight in England, France, Spain, Italy and Germany: Most chances created, 2016/17 From open play, Top five leagues in Europe \nAlexis has not just created more opportunities for his team mates than any other player in Europe - he has created loads more. 13 more, to be precise. \nIn other words, Alexis has been 29 percent more creative than any other player so far this season. \nThat is a stat so remarkable, even Alexis himself can't quite understand it… Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T12:14:29.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
