Celebration at the Top, a new dining event coming to California Grill at Disney’s Contemporary Resort , can be perfectly summed up in three words: savor, sip, sparkle. \nCelebration at the Top guests can check in at California Grill an hour before fireworks. After being whisked up to the California Grill, which sits on the 15th floor of Disney’s Contemporary Resort, guests will be taken to the intimate and secluded banquet rooms. Enjoy canapés, a selection of sushi rolled by the expert California Grill sushi chefs, a selection of flatbreads and other small plates. A complimentary bar offering craft beers, California wines, cordials and coffee will also be available.\n\nJust before the night spectacular begins, guests will be lead to their private observation deck, which offers stunning views of Magic Kingdom park and the fireworks. After taking in the breathtaking sights and sounds, guests can return to the private room for petit four desserts including decadent chocolate confections and fruit tarts.\nReservations for Celebration at the Top are now open for Thursday evenings from February 26 to March 26. Cost is $99 per person, plus tax and gratuity. Complimentary valet parking is included.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:53:32.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
