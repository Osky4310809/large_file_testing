The time-lapse, first uploaded to YouTube on Monday, has received more than 150,000 views, and puts China’s air pollution problem into a frightening new perspective.\nEach winter, heavy smog blankets Beijing and the surrounding region as people burn more coal for heating. An “orange alert” for smog, the second-highest warning level, was in effect on Tuesday, reports Reuters , as the level of harmful PM2.5 particulates in the city’s air rose above 500 micrograms per cubic meter. (The World Health Organization’s definition of a “safe” PM2.5 level is under 25.)\n\nRead More: Beijing’s Air Pollution is Frightening. This Video Shows Just How Bad It Gets \nChas Pope, the Beijing-based Briton who made the time-lapse, said in the clip’s description that the smog he captured exceeded 400 on the U.S. air quality index — a level within the U.S. definition of “hazardous” air quality, reports the New York Times .\nBank of AQI400+ smog rolling into Beijing just now – within 20 minutes https://t.co/jbk3byT37C #beijing #airpocalypse #smog pic.twitter.com/Sf5Zom6F9M \n— Chas Pope (@china_chas) January 2, 2017 \nOver the holiday period hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed in China due to the smog. Bloomberg reports that a third of China’s cities have been affected, with 25 issuing red alerts.\nAnother smog-related video making the rounds online this week, as reported by the South China Morning Post , shows drone footage uploaded by Chinese state media of huge lines of gridlocked traffic on highways near Beijing, shrouded in thick, grayish smog.\nBut Chinese officials have said that the overall air quality picture in Beijing has improved, according to Reuters . Data provided to Chinese media by the Beijing municipal Environment Protection Bureau shows that PM2.5 concentration in Beijing fell by 9.9% to an average of 73 micrograms per cubic meter in 2016 — still 109% over the national standard.\nCiting Chinese state media, Reuters reports that there were 12 more “blue sky days” in 2016 than the year before, totaling 198 days, while coal consumption, as well as the numbers of polluting factories and high-emitting cars, were cut.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T09:18:54.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
