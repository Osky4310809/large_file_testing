Voekler grabbed 10 rebounds, while McQueen had six and Diamond Pate had eight. \n“I’m really proud of the way the girls stepped up tonight against a team that’s one of the best offensive rebounding teams we’ve played against,” Goodrich coach Jason Gray said. \nVoekler also made 7 of 8 free throws in the fourth quarter, leading the team with an average 12 points per game. \n“We’re not going to be able to win games with one person scoring 25,” Gray explained. “We need a few people to be contributors on the offense end at different times.” \nThe defense dug in despite a height disadvantage, Gray added. \nThe Hawks (9-3, 4-2 GAC Red) handled Goodrich earlier this season, but fell from the top spot in the rematch. Deajah Cofield led with 13 points. \nHamady is missing three-year starter and Indiana State-commit Crystal Rice, who tore her ACL midseason. Without their top scorer and leader, coach Keith Smith said, the team is trying to find a new identity. \n“At the beginning of the season, we had good chemistry while she was there,” Smith said. “We were playing excellent. \n“We just started all over trying to find ourselves.” \nGoodrich (9-4, 5-1 GAC Red) leads the conference on a five-game win streak, following a tough stretch around the holidays when the Martians dropped 3 of 4. The young squad has found a path to consistency, Gray said. \n“It’s nice to play in front, rather than from behind,” he said. “I feel good about how we can win games.” \nGoodrich faces Davison on Tuesday, while Flint Hamady faces Detroit Edison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T15:25:11.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
