Probably less than model-slash-actress Emily Ratajkowski, who apparently has no problem braving the cold New York weather to take her dog for a stroll wearing nothing but her underwear. She's a braver woman than I am. \nIt's all in the name of fashion, of course. In DKNY's new #GoodMorning intimate, hosiery, and sleepwear campaign, Ratajkowski wakes up to her demanding, wiggly dog who wants to go out (OK, that I can actually relate to), slips into some lacy black lingerie and a pair of boots, and heads out for a leisurely walk through the city, earning both the ire and awe of her neighbors (as one does, obviously). A taxi driver even gets into an accident after stopping to stare at Ratajkowski. No big deal, right? Just your typical day in New York City.
