Students should never be treated this way,\" the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina said in a tweet. \nDesiree Harrison, who identified herself as the mother of the girl, Jasmine Darwin, told local broadcaster WRAL she was shocked by the video. \"When I'm looking at this video, I'm like 'Oh my god, this cannot be happening to my child,'\" she said. \nA video published online by WTVD shows two girls in a fist fight before being separated and then pans to show the officer slamming the other girl to the floor. \nThe broadcaster said the officer had been assigned to the high school since 2013.
