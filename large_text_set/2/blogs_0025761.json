Mannie Fresh and Lil Wayne – Juvenile, 400 Degreez , 1999 \nToday is one of the most important days in American history, at least according to Wikipedia and this one post from Buzzfeed that probably used Wikipedia as its source. Honestly, the date doesn't matter as much as the fate—the fate being that of all humanity, which came together on this day in 1999 to solve all that ails us. \nOn February 24, 1999, Juvenile released the song \"Back That Azz Up,\" changing the course of the world—and, in the process, music—forever. How great is \"Back That Azz Up\"? Well, for starters, when I told my friend and coworker Trey, who runs the VICE social media accounts (hi Trey, please tweet this from @VICE!), that I was writing about this song today and asked if he wanted to chip in, he literally ran outside and delivered the following speech to me, which I had no choice but to transcribe verbatim: \"How moths react to light, that's how humans react to 'Back That Azz Up.' This is the one bind that all of us have... I've never heard somebody say they don't like this song. Anybody that doesn't like this song doesn't like themselves.\" Which, really, what more needs to be said? \nBut, since I asked, I will answer myself in the form of another answer from Mannie Fresh. In 2014, Complex interviewed Mannie about \"Back That Azz Up,\" which, as we've established, is the greatest song of all time and which was produced by Mannie Fresh. He also raps on it. He shared, in the interview, just how big he saw the song getting: The crazy thing was the song was probably a year and a half old. Juvenile was already doing that song in clubs, but it didn't have that beat to it, so it didn't have the impact. It was more like a DJ backspinning and him saying his rhymes, but no music on top of it. I was just like, 'Dude, that song is so incredibly cool, you just gotta figure it out how you make it touch everybody.' I figured, how do we get everything? If we put 808 drums under this with the bounce, we got the hood. We got to get white America too, how do we do that? I was like, 'If we put some classical music on there, not only are you going to get young kids [but white America too].' I remember Sharon Stone commenting about 'Back Dat Azz Up' like, 'That's my favorite song,' and I'm like, 'You got Sharon Stone backing that ass up? You arrived.' I definitely smiled when I was making that record. I was like, 'This right here, this the one.' It's one of them songs that will go on for forever. If I went up against a whole gang of tough ass DJs, I would open my set up with 'Back Dat Azz Up,' like, 'It's over. Who want with me?' Every producer dreams of a 'Back Dat Azz Up.' Not to discredit 'Ha,' but 'Ha' does not have that feel to it. I'm pretty sure I can't play 'Ha' at a Bar Mitzvah and kids know it. They'll be like, 'I don't know that, but I know 'Back Dat Azz Up!' \nOK, so it's Sharon Stone's favorite song. But I feel like y'all still don't believe me on the influence, so let me trot out a few more facts about the impact of this song, courtesy of Wayne, who doesn't even have a real verse. Wayne showed up for like 20 seconds and just intoned the phrase \"drop it like it's hot\" over and over and not only did it make this the hottest song ever, it then spawned not one but two Billboard number one hits, Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" and Wayne's own \"Lollipop,\" which repeats the line. Incidentally, both of those songs are the only number one hits from two of the most enduringly successful rappers of all time. I'm just saying. But wait, there's more: Drake jacked the beat for his fan favorite track \"Practice.\" And Wayne's whole bounce riff of the \"wobbledy wobbledly\" outro also spawned Big Sean's first good song and an even better remix of it with Nicki Minaj. Basically, no music was ever as important as \"Back That Azz Up.\" \nAnd I'm not finished. \nHere are some more good facts about \"Back That Azz Up,\" via Juvenile discussing the video with XXL in 2012 : It was shot in two days, at a concert in Baton Rouge and then in front of Juvenile's middle school in New Orleans, Carter G. Wilson, \"pretty much the roughest school uptown.\" At the New Orleans shoot, it was raining so hard they almost couldn't film. Also, E-40 and Kurupt were there with their whole crews, but they didn't end up in the video for some unknown reason. That's how good this video is: E-40 showed up to the shoot, and he didn't even make the cut . And yet this video, like the song, is objectively perfect. (Side note: Remember in like 2013 when a whole group of white people found out about twerking for the first time? That was cute. Also a good example of why this video should be taught in schools—for better cultural literacy rates.) \nAnyway, happy birthday to \"Back That Azz Up,\" a song that is now legally an adult and thus old enough to appreciate the mature themes alluded to therein. Oh yeah, another reason this song is brilliant is that it is pretty PG, even if it was not-PG enough to avoid a radio edit, which was also good and invented the phrase \"back that thang up.\" Go forth and back that thang up, all of you, on this fine Friday in February, a time to celebrate Black History and, as part of it, this song. \nFollow Kyle Kramer on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:02:15.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
