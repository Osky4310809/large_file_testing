Problems in any of these areas could mean that use of the carriers is delayed or reduced. \n“The next three years are critical as the programme moves into a high-risk period of trials, testing and training. The technology is innovative and operational unknowns, which will only become clear during testing, may affect plans and increase costs. \n“To recover earlier delays, the department has already compressed the timetable and is running some testing in parallel with other tasks. HMS Queen Elizabeth (Photo: PA) \n“The closely timed sequence of tasks offers no further room for slippage and there remain significant risks to value for money.” \nThe NAO said the MoD was already facing a 1% to 2% cost overrun on the £6.2 billion budget for building the ships, while the forecast £5.8 billion earmarked for the US-built Lightning II fighters could be affected by fluctuations in the value of sterling. \nIn the longer term, the NAO said the deployment of the carriers would have far-reaching implications for the way the Navy operates with a “significant proportion” of the fleet required to support and protect them. \nThe formation of a carrier task group is likely to account for about 27% of the Navy’s fleet by tonnage and 20% of the personnel needed to crew the fleet. \n“Currently, the Navy carries out multiple operations concurrently using single ships. This means the Navy will need to change fundamentally how it operates and make judgements on priorities,” the NAO said.
