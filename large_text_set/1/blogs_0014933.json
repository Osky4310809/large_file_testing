Jones , USA TODAY Published 10:56 a.m. ET Jan. 17, 2017 | Updated 13 hours ago 487 Shares A video posted by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Jan 16, 2017 at 3:07pm PST \nGotcha! \nAmber Rose and her boyfriend, Val Chmerkovskiy, were caught on the Kiss Cam during their first high-profile appearance as a couple at the New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden Monday. Rose took to Instagram to post the viral clip, in which the Dancing with the Stars alumni are seen seemingly shying away from a public display of affection before Chmerkovskiy leans in for a quick cheek kiss. \n\"Why is he so cute tho,\" Rose wrote of the precious moment. \nThe couple first became acquainted on the set of ABC’s Dancing when Rose was partnered with Chmerkovskiy's older brother, Dancing champion, Maksim, who later went on to win the mirrored ball with Laurie Hernandez . \nThe pair fueled rumors last month when they were photographed stepping out together hand-in-hand. Rose then stoked the flames by referring to Chmerkovskiy as her \" bae \" on social media before confirming the relationship on the first 2017 episode of her Loveline with Amber Rose podcast, which she co-hosts with sex therapist Dr. Chris Donaghue. \n\"It's so good,\" Rose said of their relationship. \"It's been four months now and it's awesome. You know, I love his family and everyone's just so great and he's great.\" \n\"You know, I just feel like it’s so hard being famous and dating — not so much for the people but (with) the fans and, like, the people outside looking in,\" she continued. \"It’s, like, you date someone so you have to be with them for years or forever and you have to get married. And it’s just like, you know, you date people to get to know them and you either like them after six months or you don’t and you kind of just figure it out along the way. And right now, it’s just absolutely amazing and I’m super, super happy.\" \nSounds like someone might have just danced away with Rose's heart. Facebook Posted!
