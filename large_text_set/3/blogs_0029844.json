In January, Camden Pub opened for limited hours and eliminated its lunch service due to lack of business, according to Liberto. \nCalling it a “tough decision,” Liberto said a combination of factors — including declining revenue and rising operational costs — led to the closure. \n“It got to the point where I was opening on, say, a Monday, and I’m just trying to make enough money to open the next day,” Liberto said. “It finally hit me one day: What am I doing? I had to stop the bleeding.” Caption Who has the best chicken box in Baltimore? \nBaltimore readers voted for the best chicken box in Baltimore and we talk with the winner and finalist.

Thanks in part to the Orioles’ American League East division crown and postseason run, Camden Pub had its best financial year to date, Liberto said. \nBut in April 2015, the rioting and unrest that followed protests surrounding the death of Freddie Gray caused Camden Pub to lose $30,000 in potential revenue that week, Liberto said, and the bar never recovered. That October, he put Camden Pub up for sale, but it continued to operate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:59:11.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
