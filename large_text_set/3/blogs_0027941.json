Our favorite redhead, AKA Ellie Kemper, has traded in her signature Unbreakable Kimmy Shmidt locks for a little hair makeover ( * we suppose this is Jacqueline’s doing* ). But we must say, we’re totally digging Kimmy’s new cropped cut this season. Instead of her collar-bone-length tresses, she’s snipped off a few inches for a sleek new bob.\nAnd gosh-dang, it looks fantastic!\nWhile we may have to wait until May for Kimmy, Titus, Lillian and the gang to return to Netflix , we’ve spied a few sneak shots of the loveable cast and crew filming away in New York City. Which is exactly how we caught on to Kimmy’s cool new bob haircut.\nPhoto by Steve Sands/GC Images Sweet look, Kimmy! The bob and its good friend, the lob , have been a trendy hairstyle for quite some time now. And seeing as her character’s getting better acquainted with the ways of trendy New Yorkers, it only makes sense that she’d opt for this savvy chop.\nPhoto by Steve Sands/GC Images But in real life, we’re guessing Ellie’s cute new ‘do might’ve been caused by something else. As in, girl *just* had a baby , so this new chop is a two-for-one for its sleek look and easily styled nature. ‘Cause when you’re a new mom with a hit Netflix show, you just don’t have time to be fooling around with Cher hair !\nPhoto by Steve Sands/GC Images Clearly, Kimmy’s not having a problem working this new ‘do. Get it, girl! Now, go ahead and clear your calendars on May 19 for an optimal binge-watching experience. We’re guessing Kimmie’s cool-girl new tresses may even be a plot point, and (like we said) our money’s on Jacquline’s sage advice being behind the haircut.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:51:32.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
