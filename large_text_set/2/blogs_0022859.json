Speaking at the headquarters of Fabrick Cat , a manufacturer of construction vehicles, Pence insisted that the pro-Affordable Care Act/Obamacare stories being told at “town hall” events aren’t legitimate. “The nightmare of ObamaCare is about to end,” he said. “Despite the best efforts of liberal activists at town halls around the country, ObamaCare has failed and it has got to go.” \nThat same day, White House press secretary Sean Spicer gave a more tempered version of the same message, saying that “There’s a hybrid there: I think some people are clearly upset, but there is a bit of professional protester, manufactured base in there.” On Tuesday, President Donald Trump tweeted the more harsh assessment, putting Pence in lockstep with him: The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2017 \nAlso on Wednesday, though, Rep. Mark Sanford (R-South Carolina) went on CNN and pushed back against the idea of the pro-ACA town hall denizens being paid protesters: Rep. Sanford says people at his town hall were local and passionate, not \"artificial crowd\" https://t.co/ylK2ewgMTh https://t.co/i4mmx2OFQj", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:27:41.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
