Analysis \nBy Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor \nSince the referendum she and her ministers have simply refused to be so explicit. \nFor months, some ministers have privately whispered about complex solutions that might keep elements of membership - the choices not being binary, mechanisms that might give a sort of membership with a different name. \nWell, no more. The simple and clear message from Theresa May's speech this morning is that we are out. \nRead Laura's blog here \nSpeaking on BBC Newsnight, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May's \"implied threat\" to turn the UK into a \"low corporation tax haven\" was an \"odd way of approaching a constructive relationship with a whole continent\". \nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief negotiator, tweeted: \"Threatening to turn the UK into a deregulated tax haven will not only hurt British people - it is a counter-productive negotiating tactic.\" Media caption Some of the headlines from Theresa May's vision for future UK-EU relations \nAfter Mrs May's speech, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: \"Ripping us out of the single market was not something proposed to the British people. This is a theft of democracy.\" \nUKIP leader Paul Nuttall said he feared a \"slow-motion Brexit\", adding: \"We want this done quickly.\" \nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon claimed leaving the single market would be \"economically catastrophic\". \nShe hinted at a second independence referendum, saying Scotland - which voted against Brexit - should have \"the ability to choose between that and a different future\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:22:24.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
