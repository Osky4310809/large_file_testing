TMZ posts video of the gunman opening fire at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport https://t.co/sJXqTv54mu pic.twitter.com/KnqzfudbCK \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) January 8, 2017 \nApparently, authorities in Fort Lauderdale weren’t too pleased about that. \nClearly, someone leaked the video. \nIt looks like they figured out who. \nPrior to TMZ’s post, only “high ranking law enforcement” officers had be granted access to the video. \nAs Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief explained , the act wasn’t simply disrespectful, but illegal: \n“To know that somebody with that type of security clearance could think that it’s OK to leak evidence into a media organization really didn’t settle well with us, and it is a crime.” \nAs the FBI and local law enforcement reviewed the leaked video, they came to believe that it was recorded off the airport’s surveillance monitor using a cellphone. \nUsing image enhancement technology, FBI investigators were reportedly able to determine details about that individual — such as his uniform’s logo and physical characteristics — that led them to take action. \nOn Tuesday, it was announced that 46-year-old Broward Deputy Michael Dingman was suspended with pay as a result of the ongoing investigation. \nCan’t be doing that. \nEspecially as a member of law enforcement. \nOur thoughts and prayers remain with the families of the victims of this heinous crime.
