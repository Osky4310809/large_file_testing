The car actually exceeded that speed, even topping 200mph in some of Camaro’s tests, but that’s the speed Camaro is comfortable advertising. Pretty zippy for a car that starts a hair over $63k.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com “Chevrolet tested the max velocity of the ZL1 (with 10-speed automatic) on the High Speed Oval at Germany’s Automotive Testing Papenburg GmBH proving ground,” Chevy said this week. “Compensating for wind speed, the top speed is the average achieved from running the ZL1 in both directions on the 7.6-mile (12.3 km) loop — 202.3 mph in one direction and 193.3 mph in the other direction.”\n“After testing the car in standard settings, which produced the 198-mph average, we set the front and rear camber adjustments to 0 degrees and the tire pressures to the maximum allowable sidewall pressure, and saw the ZL1 average over 200 mph,” Al Oppenheiser, Camaro chief engineer, said.\nThe Camaro ZL1 coupe is priced at $63,435. A model with 10-speed automatic will set you back $65,830.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:26:15.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
