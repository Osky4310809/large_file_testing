It seemed like an impossible task. But I figured, “if I can write a long blog post, I can surely write one chapter,” so I took it one chapter at a time. Before I knew it, I finished the whole thing. Small actions made all the difference and our finances work the same way.\nAdvertisement \n\nFor example, saving five bucks here and there doesn’t feel like much. What’s the point in saving, you might ask, if you can only save five bucks? Over time, that money adds up, but that’s not even what matters. What matters most is that, when you see five dollars turn into $500, or even $100, you start to feel a trace of control over your money. That’s when your financial life really turns around.\nMake Choices That Motivate You \nWhen you save five bucks, you make the decision to save five bucks. More than the money itself, that decision is key.\nAdvertisement \n\nNeuroscience researcher Alex Corb studies the link between happiness, control, and decision-making. In his book, The Upward Spiral , Corb explains that a “good enough” decision activates the brain’s dorsolateral prefrontal area , which can make you feel a sense of control. He writes:\nWhen trying to make a decision, we tend to focus on the relative drawbacks of each option, which often makes every decision seem less appealing. Nor do we usually have enough information to feel confident in the decision the world just too complex. Trying for the best, instead of good enough, brings too much emotional ventromedial prefrontal activity into the decision-making process. In contrast, recognizing that good enough is good enough activates more dorsolateral prefrontal areas which helps you feel more in control.\nIn simple terms, worrying too much about making the right decision can backfire and stress you out. On the other hand, you feel empowered when you make a decision without worrying whether it’s the best.\nThat’s precisely why small actions pack such a punch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T15:06:30.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
