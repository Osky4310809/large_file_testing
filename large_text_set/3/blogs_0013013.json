Afinidad-Bernardo   12:21pm Actress Kylie Padilla Watsons Philippines/Released \n  “Oh my gosh, 17 pa lang!” actress Kylie Padilla exclaimed when asked by Philstar.com at what age did she originally plan to get pregnant. \n“Gusto ko kasi kasabay ko ‘yung bata lumaki e. ‘Yung ‘pag teenager na s’ya, (para lang kaming magkapatid)…Lumabas ‘yung gusto kong maging nanay n’ung 17 pa lang ako,” she explained in an interview following her announcement as new endorser of personal care store chain Watsons on Thursday. \nThe 24-year-old, who is five months pregnant with her first born with fiancé, actor Aljur Abrenica, revealed that at first, she was shocked when she found out that she has been expecting. \n“But I wasn’t shocked when I saw the test. I kind of knew na kasi I was feeling different. So sabi ko, ‘Eto na ‘yun, pregnant.’ Then after n’un, there was a bit of fear. It was, as we all know, unplanned, at that time, so, I didn’t know how to handle it pa. I was so vulnerable. Pero n’ung natanggap ko na, I was happy na,” said Kylie. \nHer mom, Liezl Sicangco, who got pregnant at an early age, underwent a caesarian operation when she gave birth to Kylie. Liezl breastfed Kylie for only two weeks, so she advised her daughter to try having a vaginal birth and breastfeed her child for at least a year. \n“Excited pero nandun na rin ‘yung takot. Gaya nga ng sinabi ni Iya (Villania) na isipin mo muna ‘yung future mo. Kasi noon sarili mo lang iniisip mo. Ngayon, may bata na,\" Kylie said.   \nLiezl was not angry that Kylie is pregnant. “She’s mad that I’m not married, though!” Kylie shared with a laugh. \nWhat kind of mother does she think she will be? \nAccording to Kylie, “Dati nun, I would paint a picture of myself sa gusto kong mangyari tapos ‘pag di ko nagagawa, I’m so hard on myself. So what I do now is day by day, be the best you can!”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T07:34:20.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
