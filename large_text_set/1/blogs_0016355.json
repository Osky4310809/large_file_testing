No one was inside the home except for Cesare. \nWhen they found him, Cesare couldn’t walk and was barely breathing, though he did manage to nip one of the “intruders” before passing out. \nThe firefighters, many with dogs of their own, and some even assigned to the department’s K9 unit, gave the dog an IV and carried him outside in a litter designed for humans.

We are saddened to learn that Cesare, the dog we rescued yesterday, has succumbed to his injuries. Our deepest condolences to his owners. \n— DC Fire and EMS (@dcfireems) January 17, 2017 \nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation. \n  Mike Schuh Mike Schuh joined WJZ Eyewitness News as a general assignment reporter in 1993.
