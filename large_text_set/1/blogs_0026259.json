The cleric was still with the agency as at 8.30pm. The session was preceded by interventions from some eminent Nigerians and religious leaders. It was learnt that Apostle Suleman arrived at the DSS office at about 7.32pm without his lawyers. A top source said: “The cleric has honoured the invitation of DSS and the agency has started interaction with him.“He actually did not go in with any lawyer in line with earlier interventions by some highly-placed Nigerians and religious leaders.“The security agency is managing the interaction in a friendly manner in order to avoid any acts capable of stoking political or religious tension in the country.” Asked if the cleric would be detained, the source added: “No one can say.” A DSS source said: “We are already interacting with Apostle Suleman.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:51:12.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
