We continue to support this film, are incredibly proud of it and will release it for audiences nationwide next Friday.” In the video obtained by TMZ , a German Shepherd, which was one of at least five dogs used in production, is seen clawing at a pool’s edge and trying to run away as a trainer attempts to force the dog into the rushing water. The site reports that the scene was shot for the movie in Winnipeg, Canada, in November 2015. Based on the book by W. Bruce Cameron, A Dog’s Purpose tells the soulful story of one dog’s journey to find the meaning of his own life through the lives of the humans he touches along the way. The film is slated for a Jan. 27 release Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T05:18:51.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
