(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \nWASHINGTON • Sen. Claire McCaskill will vote against President Donald Trump's attorney general nominee, fellow Sen. Jeff Sessions. \nMcCaskill, a former county prosecutor in Kansas City, announced her decision Tuesday, citing past Session votes against reauthorization of a law aimed at putting more resources to fight, and toughening penalties for, violent crimes against women, and his support of enhanced interrogation of terror suspects. \nMcCaskill, D-Mo., issued a statement: \n“As a former prosecutor, I know the power and essence of the position of Attorney General is deciding who and what to prosecute, and where to put the priorities and resources of the massive power of federal law enforcement. Sen. Sessions’ vote against the Violence Against Women Act, and his vote for torture tactics, are a window into how he would use that power. Therefore, I cannot support his confirmation.” \nEarlier Tuesday, McCaskill, along with Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., were among the 50 senators to vote against Trump's education secretary nominee, Betsy DeVos. DeVos won confirmation when Vice President Mike Pence broke the tie. Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nBe informed.
