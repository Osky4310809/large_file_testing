When the phone linked to the messages being sent to Leela is then found in Peri’s bag, Leela fears the killer dad has teamed up with his daughter to torment her. \nThe dramatic turn of events comes as Leela’s stalker continues to torment her and she begins to suspect that Nick Savage might be behind it following the accusation from Ellie Nightingale that he raped her.\nBut, before long, her suspicions shift back to Zack Loveday when his attachment to Leela seems to be intense with even his own sister Lisa reckoning that he might be far too close for comfort.\n(Picture: Lime Pictures) Things take another twist though when DS Armstrong arrives with a lead on the phone and, as they ring it, they discover it in Peri’s bag. Coupled with the bombshell of Cameron’s escape, Leela fears for her life and DS Armstrong sets about trying to up security.\nBut when the lights go out, Leela is plunged into terror – are Cameron and Peri about to unite and finish her off? Or is another massive shock in store?\n(Picture: Lime Pictures) Speaking of the dramatic storyline, actress Kirsty-Leigh Porter said: ‘DS Armstrong comes knocking at the door with a mobile number linked to the stalker. Leela is insisting that they ring the number straight away and find out who the stalker is and when they do, they hear the phone ringing in the house. Leela is totally creeped out. They realise that it’s in Peri’s bag, which leads them to think that Peri could be involved.\n‘Peri is going through a tough time with Cameron being put away and not knowing who baby Daniel’s father is, so Leela can kind of see why she’d act out. But at the same time, you’d never expect your daughter to do something like that. She’d be totally shocked but wouldn’t hold back from confronting Peri.’\n(Picture: Lime Pictures) She continued: ‘The first instinct for Leela is that it’s Cameron because he’d be after revenge – maybe it’s someone he knows in prison who he’s sent out to do these things to mess with her head. DS Armstrong actually mentions that there’s been a riot at the prison where Cameron is held and that Cameron has escaped. Leela is out of her mind with worry and thinks Cameron is back to get them.\n(Picture: Lime Pictures) But the twists are still to come, even after this big Cameron revelation. And Kirsty-Leigh warned that things are set to get more intense before adding: ‘You’re going to be in for a massive shock when it’s revealed who the stalker actually is and who’s involved. The levels that they go to are pretty terrifying. But it touches base about things going on at the minute. I’ve read in the news about stuff like this happening for real so hopefully it will give people an incentive to get help if they are being targeted.’\nMORE: Hollyoaks arrival, return and stalker trauma: 10 huge spoilers revealed \nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Horror for Leela Lomax as her stalker gets even more sinister ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:00:19.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
