H7N9 is considered a moderate to high pandemic threat, although the CDC and WHO do not think an H7N9 pandemic is about to happen, or even that it is certain to happen. \nRelated: CDC Issues H7N9 Travel Warning \nH7N9 is one of several strains of bird flu that officials are watching because they have the potential to cause a human pandemic. \nSo far, H7N9 doesn't seem to infect people easily and people who are infected do not seem to spread it to others much. But influenza viruses change quickly and unpredictably, and if one starts passing easily from one person to another it could spread. “ H7N9 viruses have the highest risk score and are characterized as posing moder­ate-high potential pandemic risk.” \n\"From what we understand, there have been no real changes in the epidemiology or mortality of hospitalized H7N9 cases,\" Uyeki said. \nH7N9 can be deadly when people do get it. It kills more than 40 percent of people who get sick enough to go to the hospital. \nRelated: H7N9 has cost billions \n\"Early symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu and may include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and fatigue, loss of appetite, and runny or stuffy nose,\" CDC said. \nIt often progresses to pneumonia. And hospitals or clinics treating people infected with H7N9 need to take precautions to make sure patients do not infect anyone else. \n\"Clinicians should consider the possibility of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in people presenting with respiratory illness within 10 days of travel to China, particularly if the patient reports exposure to birds or poultry markets,\" the CDC says. \nThe CDC and WHO are watching the spread of several bird flu viruses that are known to infect people, including H5N1 and H7N2. \nRelated: Vet Catches Bird Flu From Cats \n\"Although the current risk to the public's health from A(H7N9) viruses is low, among the 12 novel influenza A viruses evaluated ... A(H7N9) viruses have the highest risk score and are characterized as posing moder­ate-high potential pandemic risk,\" the CDC team said in the report released Friday.
