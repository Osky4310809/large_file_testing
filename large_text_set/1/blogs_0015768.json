Media caption Tulip Mazumdar takes a look at what could be the next global epidemic \n\"We have to be much better prepared.\" \nEbola killed more than 11,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. \nThe arrival of the Zika virus in Brazil in 2015 has left thousands of children brain-damaged. \nDuring both outbreaks, there were no treatments or vaccines to prevent people getting sick. \nScientists scrambled to resurrect research on these obscure diseases. 'Guessing game' \nEffective vaccines were eventually developed during the Ebola outbreak, but only as it started to wane. \nNevertheless, governments, scientists and regulators all came together with unprecedented speed, and managed to expedite the notoriously complex development and regulatory processes.
