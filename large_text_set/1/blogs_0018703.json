The whistleblower site, which was blasted during the US election campaign for only releasing material damaging to the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, tweeted the request with a link to its submission page. Trump Counselor Kellyanne Conway stated today that Trump will not release his tax returns. Send them to: https://t.co/cLRcuIiQXz so we can. \n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 22, 2017 \nCuriously, in a second tweet, Wikileaks risked further antagonizing the president many have said it was instrumental in helping him get elected in the first place, when it compared the newly inaugurated president’s breach of promise to release his tax returns comparable to Clinton hiding her Goldman Sachs speech transcripts. Trump's breach of promise over the release of his tax returns is even more gratuitous than Clinton concealing her Goldman Sachs transcripts. \n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 22, 2017 \nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly refused to release his tax information to the public saying they were under audit but pledged to do so after this process was complete. That changed, however, on Sunday when Conway confirmed Sunday in an interview on ABC's This Week, that he has no plans to do this, stating people don’t care. \"The White House response is that he’s not going to release his tax returns,\" she said. \nWhile presidents are not required to disclose their tax returns, all US presidents since Nixon have done so voluntarily. A petition was launched the day of Trump’s inauguration calling for the release of his tax returns. It quickly reached the 100,000 signatures required to get a response from the White House. \nWikiLeaks' request has prompted mixed reaction among its followers, with many stating they do not care about Trump’s taxes... @wikileaks President Trump was a private citizen of the U.S. with rights to privacy! Wikileaks should understand and respect said privacy! \n— TJSLATS (@s_hand3485) January 22, 2017 \n.... while others emphasized the wider public want the files released... To all those who \"don't care,\" you're in the minority, and the rest of us don't care how *you* feel. #PersonalResponsibility @wikileaks pic.twitter.com/6jDwVNjdKS \n.... yet others accused Wikileaks of doing “too little, too late”, circling back to the left with an empty gesture to get on side with liberals again. @wikileaks Wait what? I thought you were DJTs best friend. What happened? \n— Rahul Sood (@rahulsood) January 22, 2017 @wikileaks Nice try, but it's too late to backpedal. You'll forever be tied to Trump's election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:02:35.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
