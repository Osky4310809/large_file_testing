Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nZlatan Ibrahimovic has told Paul Pogba he must learn to handle the pressure that comes with being the world’s most expensive player. \nMidfielder Pogba had a Sunday afternoon to forget as Ibrahimovic scored late on to salvage a point for Manchester United in a 1-1 draw with arch-rivals Liverpoo l at Old Trafford. \nLast summer's £89million signing from Juventus gave away the penalty from which Liverpool scored and was largely anonymous as Jose Mourinho's men saw a nine-game winning run come to an end. \nThe build-up to the game was all about Pogba, who was the top-trending topic worldwide on Twitter after becoming the first footballer to have his own personalised emoji. \nWatch — His reaction to Sunday's late equaliser suggests Rio Ferdinand is a United fan: Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Man United are out of the title race, according to Old Trafford hero Vidic \nWith boss Mourinho hailing him as a future United skipper and former Red Paddy Crerand comparing him to Old Trafford icon Sir Bobby Charlton, there was huge expectation on Pogba. \nAgainst that backdrop, it was perhaps no surprise the 23-year-old Frenchman — who also launched a fashion collection less than 24 hours after the final whistle — failed to deliver on the day, but Ibrahimovic warned him he must be able to cope with the pressure that comes his way. \n“Pressure is something I enjoy,” said the 35-year-old Swedish superstar, who made it 19 goals for his debut season in English football. “I don’t know Paul personally to be able to answer that for him. But I think he likes it also because, without pressure, we would not be on our toes at the top level. Pogba gave away the penalty Liverpool scored their goal from with this handball...

So it’s something that we learn from and something we have to handle, because we belong to the top, Paul belongs to the top absolutely, and the pressure will be there.” \nUnited are one of the world's most commercially savvy clubs, with 64 global sponsors, a fanbase of 659 million and a Twitter following of close to 10 million. \nBut there is an argument to suggest undue pressure was put on Pogba ahead of the Liverpool game, with the exhaustive capital United made out of the hype surrounding the launch of his unique emoji. \nThe 23-year-old is a willing participant in his burgeoning social media profile, frequently feeding his 15 million Twitter and Instagram followers with images and video clips of him goofing about.

But the vastly experienced acknowledged there is more pressure on younger players now than when he started out in the late 1990s. \n“I think football is like that today, with the social media and the media building up the game” said Ibrahimovic. “When I started to play there was no social media, none of these things. But it’s part of the game now.
