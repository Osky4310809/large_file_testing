ADVERTISEMENT \nAteneo gave its head coach Tai Bundit, who arrived in Manila on Tuesday, a reason to celebrate in his first game back from Thailand. \n“If you look at UE, you can get yourself in trouble because they really have a tall team,” said Ateneo deputy Sherwin Meneses in Filipino. “They really improved this year.” \nThe Lady Eagles cruised in the opening set but the Lady Warriors played with more fire in the last two sets and kept the game close. \nUE, which remained winless at 0-5, tied the second set at 21 after a Kim Gequillana error before Ateneo responded with four unanswered points. \nThe Lady Warriors were also ahead, 18-17, in the third set before muffing their chances with a slew of crucial errors. \nBea de Leo added 11 points while Jia Morado had 35 excellent sets for Ateneo. \n“Jia is such a good setter. She really studies her teammates tendencies and she’s going to be the one who will carry us in crucial moments.” \nShaya Adorador and Mary Anne Mendrez had 11 points apiece for the Lady Warriors, whose size and length bothered the Lady Eagles resulting to 12 block points. \nAteneo will wrap up its first round campaign against UP and defending champion La Salle. \n“Our practices this week is for UP. We’re really preparing hard for them,” Meneses said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:47:19.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
