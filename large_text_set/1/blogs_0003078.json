Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher's requests will be honoured (Photo: Rex Features) \nAlongside her will be a small coffin, and it is said it will contain some of the ashes belonging to her daughter Carrie, who was just 60-years-old when she passed. \nSince the pair's tragic deaths, only a day apart from each other, Carrie's half sibling Joely has penned a heartfelt tribute to the actress, who was arguably best known for playing Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise.
