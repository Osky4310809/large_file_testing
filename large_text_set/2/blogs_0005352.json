Trump and O’Donnell have had an ongoing, very public, and way heated feud going back to at least 2006, when Trump told People, “Rosie’s a loser. A real loser. I look forward to taking lots of money from my nice fat little Rosie.”\nIn fact, he insults her pretty much every opportunity he gets:\n. @Cher attacked @MittRomney . She is an average talent who is out of touch with reality. Like @Rosie O'Donnell, a total loser!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2012 \n\nTalking to People in 2016, O’Donnell said, “Probably the Trump stuff was the most bullying I ever experienced in my life, including as a child. It was national, and it was sanctioned societally. Whether I deserved it is up to your own interpretation.”\nRelated: Rosie O’Donnell’s Brother Compares UFC To Gay Adult Films On NY Assembly Floor \nSo naturally, O’Donnell would be gung-ho to play Trump’s righthand goblin Steve Bannon, as she’s made abundantly clear on Twitter:\n@calvininsf – i am here to serve – alec has trump – melissa has spice – i would need a few days to prepare – so if called – i will be ready\n— ROSIE (@Rosie) February 7, 2017 \n\n#BannoninChief https://t.co/UVkK2D6byX \n— ROSIE (@Rosie) February 7, 2017 \n\navailable – if called i will serve !!! https://t.co/LT84EJjfsw \n— ROSIE (@Rosie) February 7, 2017 \n\nLet’s all pray to the gods of casting to make this a thing.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T19:37:36.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
