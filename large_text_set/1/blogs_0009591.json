Kind of a big deal, I was 6 years old and my dad took me to see Fantasia. It was astounding. The music, the spectacle of the whole thing. It was kind of a life-changing experience,” Steve said. “I never saw my father again after that day. Fantasia day.”\nKristen had a similar experience.\nKristen Wiig and @SteveCarell team up to present Best Motion Picture – Animated. #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/456617TZCG \n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 9, 2017 \n\nAlso pictured inside: Kristen on the red carpet at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday (January 8) in Beverly Hills, Calif.\nFYI: Kristen is wearing a Reem Acra dress, Christian Louboutin shoes, a Calvin Klein clutch, and Chanel jewels.
