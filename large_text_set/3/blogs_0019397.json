Instead, developer Inti Creates is pivoting to a version for the Nintendo Switch. No other platforms have been affected.\nThe news was revealed today as an update on Bloodstained 's Kickstarter page . In it, director Koji Igarashi explains that production on Wii U was canned because it was \"difficult to receive the necessary support from the hardware maker.\" Nintendo's relatively-sudden emphasis on the Switch left the Wii U as an afterthought.\nThis is a troubling development for some people who backed Bloodstained  on Kickstarter specifically because a Wii U port was a stretch goal. For those people, Inti Creates is offering a few choices. First (and easiest), they can get it on Switch; it seems as if the current system will automatically transfer Wii U orders to Switch so no further action is necessary. Or, they can move their order to any other platform. If none of that sounds satisfactory, Wii U backers are eligible for a refund of their pledge.\nFor those who signed up for a Wii U copy, you'll probably want to visit the Kickstarter page to get a more in-depth look at your options. For everyone else, it's just another step toward the inevitable and impending conclusion that the Wii U is entirely a thing of the past. For us, just another opportunity to use our \"Canceled on Wii U\" tag.\nDevelopment Update -- Bloodstained for Nintendo Switch [Kickstarter]\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:49:14.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
