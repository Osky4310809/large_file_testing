As Thrillist reports, a vacation home company is hiring someone to travel the world and share their adventures online. And if that job description isn't appealing enough, they’re also offering a pay rate of $10,000 a month. \nThe “best job on the planet,” as THIRDHOME describes it, is a three-month position that lasts from late summer to the end of fall. During that time, the traveler will stay in up to 12 luxury vacation homes and blog, vlog, and share social media posts about their experiences. \nThe company is looking for a “luxury connoisseur with an appreciation for the finer things in life” who has “the ability to tell a great story and promote our brand through eloquent words, pictures, videos.” All travel expenses will be covered by THIRDHOME, and the chosen candidate will be allowed one companion at any time, as long as they pay for the travel themselves. \nTo be considered, applicants should make a one-minute video describing why they’re the best fit for the job and send it to by March 30. This is one case where bragging about your social media popularity is definitely encouraged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:59:33.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
