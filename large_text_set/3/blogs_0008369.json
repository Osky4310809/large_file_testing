(ANI) \nJustice CS Karnan played “dalit” card in protest against his arrest warrant issued by the Supreme Court on Friday to ensure his presence before it on March 31 in a contempt case. The serving judge of Calcuttta also called the order of the apex court as “arbitrary” that has been taken just to ruin his life and career.The apex court said that the Supreme Court registry has received a fax from Justice Karnan on March 8 in which he had discussed certain administrative issues. The bench, however, refused to consider the March 8 communication as a response of Justice Karnan on the contempt notice observing that it reflected allegations “on certain named judges”. \nUnhappy over the order of SC, Justice Karnan said that the issue “is a national issue” and that is why he had made representation to PM stating that some judges committed illegal activities. But on the basis of representation SC issued suo moto contempt without enquiry, discussion or findings, said the judge. \nHe further called the SC order an “arbitrary” and blamed that it was taken against him in order to ruin his life and career. At the end of his media interaction, the judge mentioned his ‘dalit’ status and stated that it is a reason behind the entire issue. “It is a caste issue, a Dalit judge prevented from doing work in a public office. That is atrocity,” said Justice Karnan. \nYou may also like to watch: \nThe apex court had on February 8 asked Justice Karnan to appear in person and explain why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him. It had restrained him from undertaking judicial and administrative work. However, Justice Karnan failed to appear before the apex court on February 13. During the last hearing, senior advocate K K Venugopal, appearing for the Registrar General of the Madras HC, had said the High Court judges needed protection from Karnan’s verbal abuse and wild charges. He had said the judge concerned had levelled malicious rape charges against a sitting Madras High Court judge.
