Dish, Sony and AT&T already have internet cable alternatives, and Hulu has one coming soon. \nNone of these have been huge hits yet. YouTube is hoping its expertise in recommendations and search makes it stand out. \nIts version will cost $35 a month for about 40 networks, similar to rivals. But it’s initially limited to a few cities where it has deals with broadcasters. And so far, Google doesn’t appear to have deals for popular channels such as HBO, AMC and TBS. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
