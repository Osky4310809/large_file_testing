Abiola Ajimobi had instructed him and his team to meet with the warring parties over the recent threats from them. \nAccording to him, the team has also visited other communities with similar crisis in the state and expressed confidence that the crisis will soon be resolved. \nEarlier, Chief Ademola Eyinade, a Community leader in Ibarapa Central Local Government frowned at the way the herdsmen invade and destroy farmlands in the communities, and commended the state government for its intervention. \nHe said that the herdsmen had lived in the communities for several decades with no such crisis, adding that the recent destruction of farmlands and attack on their people was uncalled for. \nMr Peter Ojedokun, who represented farmers in Ibarapa North local Government said that they had suffered malicious damages of their farmlands by herdsmen in their locality for too long. \n“Whenever you challenge them alone on the farmlands, they attack but run away when they see that you are not alone on the farm. \n“When we identify them and report to security agencies, nothing is done. When they are even asked to pay for the crops destroyed, they offer token for huge destruction,” he said. \nSimilarly, Mr Sunday Daniel, the Chairman, Afenifere Farmers Association, Ibarapa Central Local Government also complained that their crops were damaged by the herdsmen. \nHe recommended that government should establish grazing land for the herdsmen to feed their cows. \nMr Soliu Umar, a representative of the herdsmen said that many of their cows had been killed through poisonous substances which were dropped in waters along their grazing routes. \n“Our members lose 10 to 20 cows each on daily basis. We have arrested several farmers over this matter and handed them over to security agencies. \n“Those arrested are yet to pay for the cows till date. Just last week, three of our members were shot in Igangan. \n“Even some of our members have decided to revenge the act but for the intervention of the Seriki Fulani,” he said. \nUmar, who claimed he was born and bred in the community, stated that their people had lived in the communities for more than 30 years, with no such problem in the past.
