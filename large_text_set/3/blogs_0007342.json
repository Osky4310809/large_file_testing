Patrick's dad, Bob DeMarco is owner and manager. \nPatrick DeMarco, 31, a Cinco Ranch graduate, and Olivares, 28, a Katy High grad, shared musical interests after meeting through a mutual friend - DeMarco plays guitar and Olivares sings. After graduation, DeMarco attended the University of Houston and Olivares attended Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in Dallas. \nAt UH, DeMarco said \"I was bouncing around majors.\" But he liked to cook at home, was always kind of interested in cooking and had management and bar experience having tended bar through college. \nHe rethought what he was doing and transferred to UH's Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management . \n\"From the beginning I wanted my own place,\" he said. \"For a while, I thought just a bar. Now it's morphed into a bar and grill.\" \nAnd, he had no doubt about who would be his kitchen manager - Eliab. \nThe introduction to Eliab's future career came about when he worked for a small appliance store at Katy Mills where one of his regular customers was a chef. The chef gave him an opportunity to cook. \nOlivares started cooking when he was 18 and his career has ranged from high-volume casual eateries to high-end boutique restaurants and working with prestigious chefs in Dallas. \n\"I'm trying to do simple food the right way,\" he said, \"sourcing food locally with as many small vendors as I can.\" \nPlanning for the restaurant started more than two years ago. \nBob DeMarco said they wanted the family restaurant to be where they lived and grew up and considered FM 1463 to be a great spot. \n\"Traveling either way on FM 1463 you'll find Chinese, fast food, pizza,\" he said. \"They don't have a restaurant with homecooked food made from scratch every day. It's the same high quality food you make at home. \n\"It's the inside the feel without the inside the loop price,\" added DeMarco. \nConstruction and weather â€“ circumstances out of their control - have delayed the opening at 4747 FM 1463 Road, Ste 100, which Olivares finds the most difficult part of the process. \n\"The most exciting part is putting my stamp on something that is my own.\" He said he opened three restaurants in the Dallas-Forth Worth metraplex and now this is his stamp on the culinary scene in Katy. \nThe restaurant will feature a 50-foot covered dog-friendly patio with dog bowls for furry friends, a full bar with 20 taps of craft Texas brew plus Texas distilled liquors and a selection of wines. \nBob DeMarco said the menu was test-marketed with people they know and won faves for its vegan food, which is intended to appeal to the diverse neighborhood surrounding the restaurant. \nThey not only spent time on the menu but also on the name. \nDeMarco said they had a skull session where they sat down and kicked around names. They visited the Katy Historical Society and wanted to go with the original name by which Katy was first called - Cane Island. \n\"We wanted something to convey the local Texas feel of what we're doing,\" said Patrick DeMarco.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T13:33:51.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
