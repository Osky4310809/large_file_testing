The transfer market is very difficult. We do not want to buy to buy. \n\"It is important to buy a player to improve our team.\" \nKluivert also clarified the futures of Blaise Matuidi and Angel Di Maria, adding: \"We also want to extend [the contract of] Blaise. Di Maria? Yes he will stay.\" \nEmery revealed PSG are looking at adding more depth going forward, though he was pleased of the performance of substitute Hatem Ben Arfa against Metz. \nEurope's most expensive squads \n\"The club is looking to improve the team to give more competition. We talk a lot about the different possibilities but it is not an easy market,\" Emery said in his post-match media conference. \n\"If the club gives me a name and tells me that he is a very good player I say yes. We want to strengthen our attack, but the work of Hatem was good.\" \nPSG have been drawn against Bordeaux in the semi-finals as they bid to win the Coupe de la Ligue for a fourth successive season.
