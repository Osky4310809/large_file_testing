You Are Probably Some Kind Of Ant. All signs indicate that you’re some variety of ant. We don’t know which of the 12,000 species of ant you are, but now that you know you’re an ant, maybe you’ll be able to figure out your exact ant subspecies on your own. Good luck. Share Your Results Results for Jesus Christ, We Should Have Narrowed This Down, But Which Animal Are You? There’s A 90 Percent Chance You’re A Dog Or A Horse. So, you really didn’t give us much to go on here. We think you’re a dog or a horse, or maybe something similar like a coyote or a mule. There’s an outside chance, 10 to 15 percent at most, that you’re very different from a dog or a horse, but even then you probably still have four legs. We’re pretty confident you have four legs even if you’re not a dog or a horse, but don’t hold us to that. Maybe if you liked more TV shows, junk foods, or music we could zero in closer to your animal. Share Your Results Results for Jesus Christ, We Should Have Narrowed This Down, But Which Animal Are You? Wow, We Actually Did It. You’re A Milk Snake. Huh. You’re lampropeltis triangulum syspila, the red milk snake. Got to be honest: We didn’t think we were going to stick the landing on this quiz, but we pulled it off somehow. Milk snakes are harmless but are often mistaken for the poisonous coral snake, which maybe indicates that you act tough but have a cuddly personality underneath it all? Or maybe not. We haven’t really thought that far ahead. The important thing is that we figured out what animal you are, which is a pretty impressive thing for us to have done.

Okay, so what we’re seeing is that you’re a blue whale that lives on land somewhere very dry. Obviously that’s not correct, but that’s what your answers indicated. Maybe the problem is on our end, and we completely botched this quiz. Or perhaps your spirit animal actually is a whale that lives in the desert? It seems extremely unlikely, but somebody out there has to be a whale that lives in the desert, and maybe that person is you.
