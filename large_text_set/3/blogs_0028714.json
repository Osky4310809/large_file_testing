Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com \nThe sewer district needed more green space to absorb rainfall. \nThe city wanted to pare its portfolio of thousands of abandoned homes. \nA program over a year in the making is finally chipping away at both goals. \nOn Thursday, officials will highlight the demolition of 11 condemned buildings in the Wells Goodfellow neighborhood — the first group of an estimated 1,000 derelict structures whose removal could be funded by the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District. \nMSD has earmarked up to $13.5 million to tear down buildings with the goal of creating about 50 acres of surfaces that can absorb stormwater. The sewer district plans to fund about 200 demolitions by the end of this year. That represents a significant acceleration in the pace of city demolitions: In 2016, the city took down just 377 buildings. \nMSD happens to need to target the watershed that encompasses the city’s north side, where much of the region’s poverty and blight is concentrated. \n“We’re looking for benefits beyond just the environmental requirements we have,” MSD Executive Director Brian Hoelscher said. \nSt. Louis, for its part, is angling to make the green space MSD leaves behind something more than a few vacant lots. It already creates hundreds of those every year by tearing down dilapidated properties, a number that makes only a tiny dent in the roughly 7,000 still lingering in the wake of suburbanization and disinvestment. \nIt is partnering with the Missouri Department of Conservation to help fund vegetative plantings, such as buckwheat and coreopsis, on the lots that can help beautify neighborhoods, said Rebecca Weaver, who coordinates the city’s Urban Vitality and Ecology Initiative with the state conservation department. \nThe city is talking to other organizations to help pay to maintain and plant the lots MSD leaves behind. Weaver noted that the Missouri Botanical Garden has worked on a similar MSD buyout and greening program in Baden . \n“We’re still figuring that out,” she said of funding beyond the conservation department’s initial commitment. “But there are people who have a passion for what we’re doing here.” \nThe group is still finalizing the next clusters of houses to be razed, but Hoelscher said they had a “stock of sites that we know are acceptable.” \nOriginally announced more than a year ago, MSD, the city and the Conservation Department have spent months mapping and identifying the best areas to target. \nMSD is under a court order to cut sewer overflows, so it has to reduce rooftops and pavement in areas where rain overwhelms its system. The city wants to target problem properties that neighbors want to see gone. Both want to find clusters of abandoned buildings to maximize the impact.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:00:21.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
