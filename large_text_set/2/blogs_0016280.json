The healthy-eating cafe space lands just up the block from the likes of Millie’s and Trois Familia on Sunset Boulevard.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the current matcha tea craze, you likely haven’t been paying much attention. MatchaBar is a hit in New York City already, but joins some stiff local competition from places like Midori Matcha in Little Tokyo and Matcha Box on West Third Street .\nThis location in Silver Lake has the full backing of the East Coast matcha empire though, as the MatchaBar team enjoys locations in NYC’s Chelsea neighborhood as well as Brooklyn. They even sell domestically in Whole Foods across the country, and will have a retail shelf for takeaway products here at the Los Angeles location to boot.\nJakob Layman Of course, this outlet will offer much more than just matcha teas and coffee drinks. There’s a full savory-side lineup of salads and grain bowls, plus AM egg dishes and pastries from Gjusta. MatchaBar Silver Lake should be softly serving today to the hip kids in the neighborhood.\nMatchaBar \n3534 Sunset Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA \nThe 11 Essential Silver Lake Restaurants [ELA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:12:07.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
