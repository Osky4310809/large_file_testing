Arrogate had other ideas, running away down the stretch to defend the victory he won only months earlier. \nFrequently billed as the world’s richest thoroughbred horse race, with a record $12 million purse, the Pegasus World Cup Invitational’s real plot was the rematch between co-favorites Arrogate and California Chrome. The 6-year-old Chrome won all but one of his races in 2016 en route to being named horse of the year. The sole loss came in the Breeders’ Cup Classic, where he was bested by Arrogate. \nChrome and Arrogate entered as near co-favorites — Arrogate inched up to 4-5 favorite while Chrome was 6-5 just before the start — with Keen Ice, who finished third in the Classic last year, had 12-1. \nNoble Bird took an early lead while Arrogate and Chrome ran neck to neck for much of the race. \nSecond place took home a payout of $1.75 million, third grabbed $1 million, and the rest of the field earned $250,000. The entry fee for the stakeholders race was $1 million, and the field was open to horses ages 4 years and above. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T00:55:40.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
