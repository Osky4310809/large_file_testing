In the case of both Gamora and Nebula, it has been teased that audiences will learn more about their relationship with their “father.” If that is the case, then why not include Thanos in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 as well? \n“ First of all, it's about two sisters,” director James Gunn clarified during an on-set interview. “It's not about the sisters and their father. It's about two sisters and what were the sisters' problems with each other. And yeah, some of those things were caused by being raised by the ultimate abusive father, but it really isn't about Thanos, and frankly I just wasn't inspired to put him in the movie. \n“ I kind of go with my gut on these things and it just wasn't what I wanted to do,” Gunn continued explaining. “It wasn't the most fun part of the movie last time for me, and I just didn't really want to do it this time. And again, the relationship with Thanos has nothing to do with it. It's not about their relationship with Thanos. It's about their relationship to each other. T hat was interesting to me and I thought that was important to our story, and that was important to our characters. There's a lot of stuff that happened in the past that affects our characters presently.” \nMORE: Concept Art Shows Star-Lord's Space Pirate Look / James Gunn Releases Another Piece Of The Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 Score / 5 Worlds We Want to Visit in Avengers: Infinity War / Josh Brolin Ready To Transform Into Thanos For Avengers Infinity War / Peter Dinklage's New Hairstyle Hints At Avengers: Infinity War Role / Josh Brolin Ready To Transform Into Thanos For Avengers Infinity War / Who Is Peter Dinklage Playing In Avengers: Infinity War? / Is Peter Dinklage Playing MODOK In Avengers: Infinity War? / Zoe Saldana Confirms Gamora For Avengers: Infinity War / Chris Hemsworth Says He Still Hasn't Seen The Avengers: Infinity War Script / Avengers: Infinity War To Film in Scotland / Avengers: Infinity War Is Casting Extras For Alien Roles / Avengers: Infinity War Sets Production Start Date / Avengers: Infinity War Directors Tease Mysterious New Prop Video \nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos.
