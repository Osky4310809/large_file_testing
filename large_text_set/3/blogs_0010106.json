from the rest of rugby league. \nRight now Manly’s squandered salary cap has them over a million dollars behind the rest of the pack, just when Trent Barrett needs all the help he can get. \nThe medical retirements of Brett Stewart and Steve Matai have smacked the Sea Eagles hard on the field, but even harder off it once the NRL ruled their 2017 salaries had to count towards this year’s salary cap. \nBetween them the club legends chew up over $1 million of Manly’s roster, but the fact they were both signed on back-ended deals with pre-existing injuries means there is no relief from head office. \nWhat Barrett would give for a break as he takes his squad to Townsville minus front-rowers Marty Taupau, Addin Fonua-Blake (both suspended), Darcy Lussick (wrist) and Lloyd Perrett (fractured eye socket). \nWith discontent and chatter around Barrett’s future getting louder by the day, the second-year coach hit the phones last week, hunting a prop to help out his severely understrength pack. Des headed back to Manly? 1:30 \nBen Ikin, Nathan Ryan and Ben Glover are joined by Dragons recruitment boss Ian Millward to discuss the club’s recruitment plan and why it revolves around Ben Hunt. \nYou can also subscribe via iTunes or for Android users, listen on the iPP Podcast Player app. \nSam Moa, who left the Roosters last year for a lucrative two-year deal with Catalans, was discussed recently by powerbrokers on the Beaches as an option. \nWhen Moa was still hunting an NRL gig last year, Manly were also interested in the Kiwi international, but on both occasions the Sea Eagles simply couldn’t compete with the French outfit. \nThat salary cap strain and a questionable recruitment strategy is a chicken and egg scenario, but either way it’s biting hard, and Barrett’s the one feeling it. \nOf the 20-odd players brought to the club since he was named to take Geoff Toovey’s clipboard midway through 2015, you can count on one hand those that have delivered more bang than the bucks paid for them. \nQueensland prop Nate Myles continues to deliver nowhere near what’s been outlaid for him, while Barrett last week called on Taupau to stop getting himself suspended. \nPressure is mounting thanks to an underperforming roster, just as cracks begin to open up again in the front office. DCE laughs off Barrett talk 1:05 \nTalk is that new CEO Tim Cleary, with a mandate to cut costs and bring sponsors to the club, is butting heads with patriarch Bob Fulton — the club colossus who has pulled plenty of the strings behind Barrett’s current roster. \nIn the past Manly has somehow thrived despite the infighting and factional feuds. The fan is still in pieces from the last time the proverbial hit it. \nNow as head coach Barrett wears the mess, even when others can claim responsibility for making it. \nWe’re only two weeks into the 2017 season. But a clean up is needed already. \nWarriors hot shot feeling the heat \nAcross the ditch, strong stuff here from Warriors CEO Jim Doyle in The New Zealand Herald on Sunday. \nThe high profile boss, formerly Dave Smith’s second in command at the NRL, knows 2017 is a “defining season” for both the club and individuals. Kieran Foran’s addition to the Warriors ramps up the expectation on the club. Source: Getty Images \nNot least for Doyle himself, with success expected like never before, because the game’s perennial sleeping giant have never before had such a strong roster or coaching set-up. \n“Obviously it depends on the circumstances,” Doyle told Michael Burgess on w here his future may lie by season’s end. \n“Things might not go well [this year] but it depends on how [it happens]. But if there has been no dramas, no issues along the way, and no significant injuries and I am sitting here thinking I don’t know how I could improve things — then there is no point me being here. \n“That would be my context. If I can’t think of anything that will make us better, then obviously I am not the right person.” \nDoyle is a cracking operator, and more up front than most club bosses, as he should be for some of the game’s longest suffering fans. \nHis handling of Kieran Foran’s return has put a few noses out of joint though — particularly comments that if he had been Parramatta CEO: “I wouldn’t have released him”. \nForan is frankly lucky to be coming back so soon, given the serious allegations of abuse and gambling that have been levelled at him since he pushed for an Eels release on compassionate grounds. \nMissing just two matches through suspension (a shoulder injury means he won’t return this week against Canterbury) is a whole lot sooner than many in the game expected or deemed fair. \nKiwis bring in the big guns David Kidwell has switched up his Kiwis coaching staff. Source: Getty Images \nStill in the promised land of L & P, David Kidwell’s underwhelming start as New Zealand national coach has seen the cavalry called in for their World Cup assault. \nSouths supremo Shane Richardson has been installed as campaign manager, while former England coach and current Warriors assistant Steve McNamara will act as Kidwell’s right-hand man. \nMcNamara will be on deck for the May 5 Anzac Test in Canberra, with Four Nations assistants Willie Poching and Justin Morgan no longer a part of the set-up. \nRichardson has been brought in for November’s World Cup with an off-field focus after an independent review of the 2016 UK tour, which saw the Kiwis draw with Scotland, lose twice to Australia and only just defeat England. \nLive stream Manly’s round three clash with the Cowboys on FOX SPORTS.
