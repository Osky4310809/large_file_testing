Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth’s New Year’s Eve party is a perfect example of that. It seems like everyone really indulged – and we can’t blame them.\nBefore that, the pair gave us some super adorable holiday Instagrams (can you say Liam Hemsworth in a giant Christmas onesie ?). Even after Liam made Miley rainbow moon earrings and we swooned, they keep sharing the most adorable pictures.\nFirst of all, here are a couple of the (super sparkle-y) photos of the NYE party. Happy new year from me and my mama!!!! @tishcyrus \nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Dec 31, 2016 at 7:04pm PST \nSorry. My dude is HOT. \nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Dec 31, 2016 at 8:01pm PST \nTBH, we’re a bit bummed we weren’t invited. Also, we’re a little obsessed with Liam’s pants. Oh and, just in case it was up for debate, they are the CUTEST couple.\nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jan 1, 2017 at 3:13am PST \nBut the party isn’t our favorite part of Miley Cyrus’ New Year. It’s how incredibly relatable she was yesterday, on New Year’s Day, when she clearly wasn’t feeling 100%. (Girl, we get it.) Her first post features sunglasses and a fuzzy shirt, and she looks so cozy that we’re *almost* envious.\nHUNG OVER MERMAID 2017 \nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jan 1, 2017 at 3:08pm PST \nThen Miley got truly real about how she was feeling.\nPretty much. \nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jan 1, 2017 at 3:49pm PST \nAfter that, Miley ate some pasta, because carbs make everything better. She was also wearing PJs, because of course.\nYu y!!!! Ske i \nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jan 1, 2017 at 5:47pm PST \nSadly, even pasta didn’t get Miley back on her feet. In fact, she posted a picture of Bill Murray’s face, because apparently that’s the only thing that could make her feel better as she dealt with a monstrous hangover.\nBill Murrays face is the only thang keepin me from a mental breakdown #hungthefuckover \nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jan 1, 2017 at 5:58pm PST \nFinally, Miley ate some pizza (yum). Generally, she also seemed less miserable. At least, she captioned the photo with, “Goodnight world. 2017 I dig you already.” So, we figure she was feeling a little better — and we’re definitely glad.\nGoodnight world. 2017 I dig you already. \nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jan 1, 2017 at 8:16pm PST \nHopefully, Miley recovered enough to be in better shape today. Honestly, though, we totally can’t blame her for partying extra hard on New Year’s Eve. We just hope she (and Liam) keep giving us super sweet and relatable pictures of their 2017 adventures.\nThe post These pictures of Miley Cyrus recovering from New Year’s Eve are just so freaking relatable appeared first on HelloGiggles .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T01:23:48.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
