Norway set to allow recreational wolf-hunting despite 'critically endangered' population \n'Recreational and cultural' killings will be allowed if the law passes Tuesday 7 March 2017 12:07 GMT Click to followThe Independent Online Wolves (Canis lupus lupus) at Polar Zoo in municipality of Bardu, Troms County, Norway. Wolves (Canis lupus lupus) at Polar Zoo in municipality of Bardu, Troms County, Norway. \nNorway is moving to allow recreational hunting of its \"critically endangered\" population of wolves, prompting furious condemnation from animal rights campaigners. \nAround 65 of the animals live in the Scandanavian country and another 25 cross the border from Sweden. \nLast year the government announced up to 47 could be killed by hunters, but that quota was lowered to just 15 two days before hunting season opened. \nNow the right-wing minority government is set to approve a new amendment in the favour of hunters, allowing \"recreational and cultural\" killings of the creatures, according to The Local . Norway's radioactive reindeer Norway's radioactive reindeer 1/6 There are more than 30,000 reindeer in Norway \nAlthough the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in Ukraine happened nearly 30 years ago and more than a thousand miles from Norway, the country's reindeer are still suffering from increased radioactivity. Amos Chapple, RFE/RL 2/6 A reindeer eats lichen \nWhen the disaster happened, larger areas of were covered by clouds of radioactive dust. When it rained or snowed in Norway that dust made its way into the landscape, contaminating everything it touched. Amos Chapple, RFE/RL 3/6 Semi-domestic reindeer roam freely around Norway's rugged landscape \nNorway's reindeer feed on lichen, mushrooms and grass. The unusually high radioactivity observed in the reindeer is thought to be linked to this years' bumper crop of mushrooms. Aina Bye 4/6 Sami heard the reindeer several times a year \nNorway's indigenous people, the Sami, are known for their reindeer herding. The animals provide a vital source of income for them. Amos Chapple, RFE/RL 5/6 Reindeer meat is widely eaten in Norway \nBecause of the unusually high radioactivity measured in the reindeer, many are not fit for human consumption and so have been released back into the wild. Aina Bye 6/6 The legacy of Chenobyl \nThe Sami people of Norway fear that it could be many years before the reindeer return to normal levels of radioactivity. Amos Chapple, RFE/RL \nUntil now, only predators considered a \"potential nuisance\" to farmers could be exterminated. \nThere are nine packs which spend all or part of their time in Norway, but the government's targets call for just four to six, prompting criticism from animal rights groups like the Worldwide Wildlife Fund (WWF), the Conservation Fund and the Norwegian Zoological Fund. \n\"Changing the law to shoot more endangered animals is outrageous, especially in the so-called eco nation Norway,\" said Nina Jensen, the head of the WWF in Norway. \nWolves are listed as \"critically endangered\" on the 2015 Norwegian list of endangered animals. \nFarmers, hunters and forest owners have always held the right to kill animals they consider a nuisance, putting them on a collision course with green activists and large swathes of the population. 30 bags found in stomach of whale beached in Norway \nThe new measure is currently up for consideration in the Norwegian parliament, but is unlikely to meet with much opposition, according to The Local. \nThe wolf currently accounts for eight per cent of the 20,000 sheep Norway's farmers lose to predators each year. Whale watching and wolves at your window in Norway's far north \nUntil the mid-19th century, large populations of brown bears, wolverines, wolves and lynxes prowled the Norweigian tundra. By the 1960s, though, wolves had been hunted to effective extinction, and bears almost followed. \nBut they were protected by law in 1971 and 1973 respectively, and numbers have been crawling back up thanks to Finnish-Russian wolves roaming into Norwegian territory. \nThere are 430 wolves across the whole of Scandinavia, up from fewer than 10 in the 1990s. They remain under threat from loss of habitat and poachers.Illegal hunting is the largest cause of wolf mortality in the region.
