Pretty clear message from Arsenal fans. Not the majority but a big group. #wengerout pic.twitter.com/5v3DPI70mX — Nizaar Kinsella (@NizaarKinsella) March 7, 2017 \nCalls of “we want our Arsenal back” could be heard on Tuesday evening as those eager to see change embraced in north London took to the streets. \nWenger was also accused of “killing our club”, while signs and banners sported slogans such as “no new contract” and “stubborn, stale, clueless” were paraded. \nFans aired their displeasure before heading to Emirates Stadium for a meeting with Bayern that many consider to be encapsulating their demise. \nWenger: Players can't pick manager \nArsenal head into the last 16 encounter 5-1 down from the first leg in Germany, with another frustrating exit from Europe now on the cards. \nThe Gunners have also slipped to fifth in the Premier League table, adding further weight to those urging the board not to hand Wenger an extension to a contract due to expire in the summer.
