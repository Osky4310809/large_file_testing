Fargo creator Noah Hawley’s Legion TV series (which is now confirmed to not be part of the X-Men cinematic Universe ) debuts on FX in February; it’s been confirmed that a second live-action X-Men TV series is currently in development and will include the Sentinels in some capacity; writer/director Josh Boone is gearing up to begin production on his New Mutants movie, possibly sometime this spring ; and depending on what you believe, the developing Deadpool sequel may have already found its Cable actor .\nMeanwhile, X-Men fans of all shades are preparing to bid farewell (for now, anyway) to the Hugh Jackman-portrayed version of Logan/Wolverine on the big screen, with the release of the upcoming Logan in theaters. It was previously reported that the new (and possibly final) Logan trailer will be arriving online this Thursday, January 19th; now thanks to Jackman, we can pretty much confirm as much to be the case.\nJackman’s latest posting on his official Twitter account is a screencap of the word “tomorrow” and it’s fair to presume he’s referring to the new Logan trailer launch. In addition, the actor posted the following screenshot taken from either the new Logan trailer and/or the film only (h/t to CBM ) with the simple caption of “Storm” .\nIt would seem that by “Storm” , Jackman is referring to the fact that Wolverine’s being rained down on by a literal storm in the Logan image above; though there are other theories. The scene pictured above takes place during a funeral that Wolverine attends in the movie (an event that is shown during in the first Logan trailer ), having in turn prompted some speculation that Logan is in fact shown here attending the funeral for Storm aka. Ororo Munroe (Halle Berry)… during a storm. That’s probably not the case, seeing as that sort of dramatic “pun” wouldn’t be in keeping with the serious and somber mood that Logan director James Mangold is going for here.\nNevertheless, odds are that the funeral sequence teased in this Logan image is for a familiar mutant character and someone close to Logan (Jean Grey, Rogue, even Hank McCoy/Beast for that matter). The plot details and footage released for Logan have thus far painted the film’s setting as being a time in which most of mutantkind has either been killed or gone into hiding, so the actual movie may include multiple explicit allusions to the deaths of beloved X-Men characters. 20th Century Fox’s second – and again, possibly final – trailer for the film, is expected to only further make it clear how bleak things are when Logan catches up with its namesake, for #OneLastTime.\nBe sure and check back here tomorrow on Screen Rant, to watch the new Logan trailer – and to learn some exclusive details from Fox’s press presentation for the movie, from this past December!\nNEXT: Win a Trip to Meet Hugh Jackman!
