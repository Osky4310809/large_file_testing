One longstanding theory was that excessive reading at close distance (particularly in poor lighting) could lead to nearsightedness by altering growth and shape of the eyeball. \nAs computers and smartphones grew in popularity, squinting at computer screens has received a majority of the blame. \nThe “bookworm theory” first emerged centuries ago when German astronomer Johannes Kepler claimed his studies caused his nearsightedness. It seemed plausible enough, especially as rates of the condition skyrocketed in regions like Shanghai, where teens spend about 14 hours a week on homework. 5 \nHowever, once investigated further, the bookwork theory came up short. When researchers looked at number of books read per week or hours spent using a computer among children in Singapore, no significant link to nearsightedness was actually found. 6 \nAccording to the authors, “neither reading nor parental myopia history were associated with values for anterior chamber depth, corneal curvature, or lens thickness.” \nThey went on to suggest that “corneal curvature and lens thickness may be subject to unrelated postnatal growth control mechanisms.” Interestingly, a number of studies now suggest one of these control mechanisms might be sun exposure. What Causes Nearsightedness? \nNearsightedness (myopia), is a vision problem in which close objects appear clear but distant objects are blurry. This condition is thought to be caused by refractive errors in your eye. Refraction is the bending of light as it passes through one object to another. \nWhen light rays are refracted through your eye’s cornea and lens, they become focused on the retina, which then converts the light into messages sent through the optic nerve to your brain, which then interprets the messages into images. \nRefractive errors occur when the shape of your eye prevents light from focusing properly on your retina. This can occur by changes in the shape of your eye, such as the length of your eyeball or shape of your cornea, and/or changes in your lens due to aging. But what exactly is responsible for these changes? \nTwo studies, the first published in 2007 7 and the second in 2008, 8 found that rates of nearsightedness in children appeared to be closely linked to the amount of time spent outdoors. The greater the number of hours spent playing outside, the lower the risk of nearsightedness. \nIn other words, keeping kids indoors and/or instilling a fear of sun exposure (for skin cancer reasons) may be at the heart of the world’s growing myopia problem. Remarkably, according to a British survey, 75 percent of children in the U.K. spend less time outdoors than prison inmates! 9 Sun Exposure Needed for Optimal Vision \nMost recently, British researchers investigated the connection between the time spent outdoors and vision among the elderly. 10 , 11 , 12 As reported by The New York Times: 13 \n“Researchers … gave vision exams to more than 3,100 older European men and women and interviewed them at length about their education, careers and how often they remembered being outside during various stages of their lives. \nThis biographical information was then cross-referenced with historical data about sunlight, originally compiled for research on skin cancer and other conditions. \nStrong correlations were found between current eyesight and volunteers’ lifetime exposure to sunlight, above all UVB radiation … \nThose who had gotten the most sun, particularly between the ages of 14 and 19, were about 25 percent less likely to have developed myopia by middle age. Exposure to sunlight up to the age of 30 also conferred a protective benefit.” \nImportantly, this relationship remained even after controlling for time spent reading, showing that gazing at screens or books is more or less unrelated to myopia, while sun exposure appears to be a primary factor. The question is how does light actually affect the structure of the eye? \nSince blood tests were drawn, they could conclude that the reduction in myopia was NOT related to vitamin D. \nAs noted by lead author Katie Williams, a clinical research fellow at King’s College London, “People with myopia have long eyeballs, so there must be something in sunlight that affects how the eye grows, especially in childhood.” \nOn a side note, they did find a correlation between myopia and lutein concentrations in the blood. Lutein, found in egg yolks and leafy greens, is known for its protective influence on eyesight and the prevention of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). \nHere, those with the highest levels of lutein had a 43 percent lower risk of myopia compared to those with the lowest levels. \nAs for how sunlight affects eye development, animal research 14 published in 2010 suggests bright light exposure helps protect your eyes by stimulating the growth of key elements in the retina, and by increasing the functioning of antioxidants in the eye. \nAn even earlier study, published in 2008, 15 showed that infrared light — found in sunlight — activates cytochrome oxidase, a photosenstive molecule located in your mitochondria. Activating this molecule led to increased cellular activity in the retina, and an increase in antioxidant properties. \nMeanwhile, research has shown that cytochrome C oxidase deficiency is a factor in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is a primary cause of blindness. 16 Outdoor Playtime May Significantly Reduce Your Child’s Risk of Myopia \nAnother recent study, <a target=\"_blank\" Visit Site", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:55:09.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
