The gesture was enough to nearly bring the 40-year-old boss to tears. \nWhy exactly did Morecambe’s fans hook him up?

The punishment for the Shrimps coach stemmed from his reaction to one of his players receiving a red card. Bentley stood up for his player, and now his team’s fans are standing up for him. \nMorecambe currently sit 17th in the League Two table, so it’s not as though the fans are just backing him because he’s doing well.
