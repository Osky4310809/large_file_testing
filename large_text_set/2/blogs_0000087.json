They will ultimately do what’s best for Barron,” a source close to the family told Us Weekly magazine. \nSources tell CBS2 the city spends $500,000 a day to protect Trump Tower when the president is in town. It would be somewhat less if it’s Melania and Barron, sources say, but still significant “because there are still two people to protect.” \n“We know there will be two distinct per day costs. One when President Trump is in New York City, and one when he is not. We are currently determining what those look like,” spokesperson for Mayor de Blasio, Freddi Goldstein, said. \nThe first lady told “60 Minutes” recently that she was prepared to live in a security bubble in New York. \nLesley Stahl : “You won’t be able to walk down the street.” \nMelania Trump : “I didn’t do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It’s another level, but it will continue.” \nCity Hall said it’s still working with the Congressional delegation to get reimbursed for what it cost to protect the Trumps before the inauguration . Congress gave the city $7 million of the $35 million it spent. \nYear-round protection could cost as much as $180 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:11:37.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
