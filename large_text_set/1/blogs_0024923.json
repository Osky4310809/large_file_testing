Gino D'Acampo performed as Peter Andre - complete with fake abs (Photo: Channel 5) \nAfter his performance, Gino allowed presenter Mel to admire his faux-abs and boasted of having \"a nine-pack\". \nWhen Mel questioned him on the location of his ninth muscle, Gino simply pointed down to his penis. \nEarlier in the episode, he'd sexually propositioned the Spice Girl, telling he he'd \"re-f*** her\" any time she wanted. \nMeanwhile, Peter performed a tribute to rapper Missy Elliott in the same episode of Lip Sync Battle UK.

Kelly’s I Believe I Can Fly while trussed up in a harness – much to the delight of the show’s hosts Mel B and Professor Green. \nHe told them: \"My right testicle is under the left one - I don't think I can have any more children.\" \nBut he lost out to Peter, who took home the giant victory belt. \nLast week, Katie Price performed as Dolly Parton on the Channel 5 show. \nThe former glamour model’s appearance on Channel 5’s lip-syncing show had been heavily teased prior to Friday night’s show airing, with a clip of her twerking to My Humps doing the rounds earlier this week. \nKatie performed two songs on the night - the Black Eyed Peas’ boobular ode My Humps and Dolly Parton’s employment-is-annoying anthem 9 to 5. \nBut it was her outing as Dolly which really showcased her talents. The former glamour model shimmied around the stage in a pink suit and giant blonde beehive wig, threw rubbish out of a wastepaper bin and at one point danced with a woman who inexplicably looked like she'd nicked Gail Platt's hair. Gino also performed R. Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly (Photo: Channel 5) \nWhile some commenters branded the performance ‘cringey’, others praised Katie for her miming prowess against her opposition on the night, Ben Fogle. \n“You were brilliant such a good sport,” wrote one Twitter user, while several fans couldn’t believe she lost out to rival Ben, saying, “Well done Katie you were robbed!” \n* Lip Sync Battle UK continues on Friday at 10pm on Channel 5.
