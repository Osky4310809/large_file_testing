They also managed to get a huge fan following, with the hashtag #NitiVeer trending all over social media. Fans even went to the extent of calling Nitibha \"Bhabhi\", and commenting about how happy they were with her and Manveer's \"relationship\" on all her posts. While the two laughed it off, and were often seen hanging out even after the show, since the last month the two haven't really been spotted together. \nWhich is understandable, because everyone has a life and they don't necessarily have to do everything to please their fans. Well, guess what, their \"fans\" disagree. Yesterday, when Nitibha posted a picture of herself on Instagram, quite a few people went crazy asking her why was she not hanging out with Manveer, why was she \"hurting them\", and how could she go on and live a regular life without him. \nWow! \nNitibha choose to ignore most of them, commenting about how she didn't need to defend herself. Kudos to you Nitibha, for ignoring the trolls, and for everyone else who wants to know why she isn't hanging out with Manveer anymore, get a life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:10:07.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
