(Photo: BBC) \nNoticeably, Roxy's daughter Amy appears to have forgotten her mother existed - instead of asking about her mum, she only ever speaks about her Auntie Ronnie. \nThose tuning in at home aren't happy that producers seem to be 'airbrushing' iconic characters like the Mitchell sisters from the show's history. \nTaking to Twitter, one wrote: \"Omg Ronnie and Roxie don't even get a full epic funeral episode! The writers must have fallen out with Sam Womack & Rita Simons #EastEnders.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:10:33.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
