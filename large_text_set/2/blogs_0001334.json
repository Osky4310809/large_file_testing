Games that aim for 60fps but don't quite hit the target - for example, Tomb Raider Definitive Edition or Project Cars - stand a better chance of sustaining a locked 60fps. Similarly, games with a 30fps target that are subject to noticeable frame-rate drops - like Batman: Arkham Knight, Just Cause 3 and The Witcher 3 - could also stand to benefit. Titles using dynamic resolution scaling, including Doom 2016, could also see improvement from more sustained performance and a tighter lock on higher resolutions. Pubs vs. video games Addiction, bluffing, and sexually suggestive imagery. \nHowever, to be clear, what we won't see will be games running at frame-rates higher than their established caps, and neither will we see drastic changes in resolution. Games that do consistently hit their performance targets will look and play exactly as they do already. \nAnother aspect to potentially consider is how Sony has implemented this feature and to what extent the Pro's capabilities are unlocked for base PS4 software. When we met PS4 system architect Mark Cerny and asked him about running base PS4 titles with Pro power, he stressed that compatibility with the existing range of 700 titles was of primary importance. Right now, we don't know whether full Pro capabilities will be deployed on base titles - if compatibility is problematic, Sony may take another route. For example, it may choose to boost GPU clocks to the Pro standard 911MHz, but leave the rest of the base mode running at standard spec. Assuming the feature is indeed included in the new 4.5 firmware, hopefully more details will emerge soon. \nAs things stand, the reports are exciting but remain unconfirmed and we've contacted Sony to ask for confirmation.
