Advertisement \nThis roof is being offered exclusively for the Global Cup race car rendition of the car so it can be eligible for competition in a greater range of events. \n“While our first year was spent concentrating on the successful launch of the MX-5 Cup car in our Battery Tender Global Mazda MX-5 Cup presented by BFGoodrich Tires, we knew that was just one arena for customers. Now with an available hardtop, Mazda racers can compete in SCCA and NASA Club Racing and in the Pirelli World Challenge TCA class,” Mazda Motorsports business development manager David Cook said in a press release .

Mazda’s representatives say over 130 of these things have been sold around the world. \nNormally they run topless, but the roof option will give the car more versatility and make racers who hate wind happy. \nAs to why Mazda won’t offer the roof for regular Miatas, company representative Jacob Brown explained to me that the fact that it’s designed around a roll cage would make it suboptimal for fitment on the road car. Sponsored \nPlus there’s the prohibitively high cost of $4,420, since it’s handmade to order and certified by race sanctioning bodies around the world. \nWhile I think first-generation Miata looks pretty sweet with the factory hardtop that was optional in the early ‘90s (and did you know it fit the second-gen, too?) Brown went on to say that the take rate was low on the optional hard roof that was later sold alongside the third-generation Miata. And of course today we have the beautiful targa-style Miata RF, so there’s not much of a business case for Mazda to offer this thing for your road car.

And maybe it’s the excuse you were looking for to get into the Global MX-5 Cup series?
