What's happened since Brexit? \nBut it has said formal negotiations on the UK's exit package will be triggered by the end of March. \nThe PM's speech will be closely-watched for signals on what the UK's future trading relationship with the EU could look like, in particular its involvement in the single market and the customs union. \nEU leaders have said the UK cannot \"cherry pick\" access to the single market while restricting the free movement of people, and Mrs May has suggested curbing migration will be her top priority. 'Eyes open' \nAddressing an audience including foreign ambassadors in central London, Mrs May will say the UK will be \"the best friend and neighbour to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe too\". \nShe will tell the remaining 27 EU member states: \"We will continue to be reliable partners, willing allies and close friends. \n\"We want to buy your goods, sell you ours, trade with you as freely as possible, and work with one another to make sure we are all safer, more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship.\" \nShe will call for a \"new and equal partnership\" with the EU: \"Not partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out. \n\"We do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries. We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave.\" \nPeople who voted Brexit \"did so with their eyes open\", the PM will say, calling the vote a \"great moment of national change\". \nShe will say the country is \"coming together\" after June's referendum, adding: \"Now we need to put an end to the division and the language associated with it - Leaver and Remainer and all the accompanying insults - and unite to make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain.\" 'Critical question' \nSince becoming prime minister after the EU referendum, Mrs May has faced repeated calls to provide more detail on her Brexit strategy, but has refused to offer a \"running commentary\", saying to do so would weaken the UK's negotiating hand. \nDowning Street said her 12 priorities would be driven by the principles of certainty and clarity and the aims of making Britain stronger, fairer and \"truly global\". \nLabour's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said \"precious little\" detail had been offered by the government so far. \nHe said the \"critical question\" for Mrs May to answer was how she would secure tariff-free trading for UK businesses with the EU, as well as what the cost implications of her plan would be. \nConservative MP Dominic Raab, who campaigned for a Leave vote, said it was \"highly likely\" the UK would leave the formal structures of the single market and the customs union, saying it was vital for Mrs May to convey a \"positive case\" for Brexit.
