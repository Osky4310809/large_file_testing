As time progressed, players started adding stipulations to make their speed runs even more challenging. One of the latest examples of this is a speedrunner who managed to beat The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past while blindfolded.\nThis incredible feat was accomplished by a Canadian speedrunner named ParisianPlayer. He managed to beat all of the game’s bosses and discovered most of its secrets while wearing a Budweiser scarf around his face. ParisianPlayer wanted to do a challenging but achievable speedrun. For that, he decided on an “all bosses, all glitches” run — thus making this speedrun the first of its kind.\n\nFor this speed run to work, ParisianPlayer used Link’s sword and bombs as a form of echolocation. This not only helped him orientate himself but also allowed him to take advantage of some of the game’s glitches. These exploits allowed ParisianPlayer to get some of the game’s strongest equipment early on. He could have used other glitches to completely bi-pass entire sections of the game. However, his goal was to beat every boss so he only used glitches that helped him obtain certain items that would make defeating them possible.\nThe other major challenge of this nearly ten-hour speedrun was physical. ParisianPlayer had to stay sitting in the same spot the entire time. This meant no bathroom or food breaks. Occasionally, someone from the Blindfolded Brotherhood (a group of gamers who do blindfolded speedruns) would check in with ParisianPlayer over Discord to let him know what was happening in the chat. Besides that, this dedicated player was all alone while doing this speedrun.\nMake sure to follow this link so that you can read a fuller account of this amazing speedrun.
