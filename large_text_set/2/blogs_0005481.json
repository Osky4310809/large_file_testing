It’s also important to keep in mind that a coroner’s inquest is not a trial, but rather a public hearing wherein a jury hears evidence and recommends to prosecutors whether or not they should pursue criminal charges. \nThe jury concluded that Dairy Queen was “negligent in training its employees” and that Suttner’s school district was negligent in “failing to prevent bullying.” Suttner, who was overweight and had a speech impediment, was an easy target for bullies both at school and at work. \nFormer coworkers of Suttner’s told the Columbia Daily Tribune that he had been forced to clean the floor by hand while lying on his stomach, and that Branham once threw a cheeseburger that was incorrectly prepared at him and “repeatedly ridiculed him.” Coworkers also said that he was often mocked to the point of “going outside and crying.” \n“The Fayette, Missouri location is independently owned and operated by a franchisee,” Dean A. Peters, director of communications for DQ told MUNCHIES. “American Dairy Queen Corporation does not employ the employees at the location and did not hire, employ or supervise the manager. \n“We recently learned of the situation and our thoughts and prayers are with the family. We are still in the process of gathering information but understand from the franchisee that the manager is no longer employed at this location.” \nSuttner’s family issued a brief statement through the special prosecutor in the inquiry, saying that the jury’s decision was “justice for Kenny.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:29:40.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
