But Ram Gopal Varma , of course belongs to a different league altogether, and he has to wish Tiger Shroff to wish in a different way. By different way, I mean, by trolling the poor Tiger as usual in typical RGV style. He posted a tweet wishing the talented young star that had a still from Baaghi which has Tiger Shroff emerging from the sea. Happy Birthday emblazoned on it. So what’s wrong with that, you ask. \nWell that was the safe part, it was the caption that the young star might offensive. The caption to the tweet read like this…”@iTIGERSHROFF Please learn machoism from @bindasbhidu who even without martial arts poses more like a man and never like this” Ouch, that’s a bad burn! That too quite unnecessary… \nHere’s the tweet… \nInterestingly, Tiger Shroff’s father Jackie Shroff, whom RGV has revered in the above tweet is a part of his upcoming movie, Sarkar 3, where he plays the main baddie opposite Amitabh Bachchan. He seems to have realised this late, as RGV issued another tweet for Jackie Shroff, saying the above tweet, as just as a fan. Well, sir, in your position you just cannot be behave like any fan! Hey @bindasbhidu all my tweets on @iTIGERSHROFF are purely as ur fan and not otherwise ..please tell this to @AyeshaShroff and him pic.twitter.com/9a53ogH4b9 \n— Ram Gopal Varma (@RGVzoomin) March 2, 2017 \nIf the maverick director had seen some of Tiger Shroff’s stunts, instead of going by this one still and his facial features, perhaps we would be singing a different tune. What do you make of this whole matter?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T20:16:29.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
