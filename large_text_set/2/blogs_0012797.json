(Brian C. Frank/Reuters) Lena Dunham, the sometimes controversial creator and star of HBO’s “Girls,” is sort of okay with being a political punching bag. Mainly because the 30-year-old Golden Globe winner says she’s actually not to blame for Hillary Clinton’s presidential loss, despite the criticism .\n“It’s amazing. I’m like, ‘Why don’t we check in with Russia, you guys?'” Dunham said in a recent interview with Rolling Stone.\nDunham, along with celebs Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus, was a consistent presence on the campaign trail and argued that star power should be harnessed.\n“I wouldn’t see any use for celebrity if I wasn’t fighting rabidly for what I thought was right,” Dunham said.\n“It was painful when people were like, ‘Hillary lost because Lena Dunham is such a bad example of liberalism.’ But everyone’s scared and upset, and they need someone to blame. It’s easier to blame me than it is to, like, blame George Clooney for not giving enough speeches or whatever,” she continued.\nThis isn’t the first time fingers have been pointed at an A-lister after the election results. Actress Susan Sarandon, who supported Bernie Sanders and later refused to back Clinton, tweeted that blaming her nonsupport for Clinton’s loss was “less painful than introspection, never knew I was this powerful.”\nFor her part, Dunham said she will be happy to have some distance between herself and her celebrity.\n“But as much as I’ve loved my job I’m a little excited to let somebody else be the poster girl for white liberalism,” said Dunham, who will retire her role as Hannah Horvath, the stand-in for stereotypical millennial angst, when the sixth and final season of “Girls” concludes later this year. “That will be a nice transition [laughs] if it can happen.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@helena_andrews", "https://twitter.com/SusanSarandon/status/798944467399147520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/lena-dunham-why-i-ended-girls-w465924"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:39:54.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
