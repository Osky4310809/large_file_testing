Take into consideration this little fact: the average woman pees six to eight times in a 24-hour period, so that's about five to seven times while you're awake. And if you have issues with your bladder (thank you, pregnancy!) or you drink a ton of water each day, your ladies' room visits are more like 10 times a day.\nSo this means you have six to 10 opportunities to fit in a little fitness. Every time you hit the bathroom, whether it's to pee or touch up your lipstick, do the workout below that should take about one minute.\nThe Workout : Complete once\n10 push-ups (lower the knees if you need to)\n10 squats\n10 alternating forward lunges (five per side)\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://health.clevelandclinic.org/2016/03/what-your-bladder-is-trying-to-tell-you-about-your-health/", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/dwphQ3AcPPBvVv5zo7hzvHlnnE4/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/28/870/n/1922729/dd1385a5ae568177_bath.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-28T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:25:22.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
