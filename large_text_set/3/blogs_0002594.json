And those are what most people dialing in from home these days use. Or they're on a laptop with a headset that can't quite filter out the barking dog and crying kid in the background. HP's Elite Slice mini desktop offers a fresh take on the problem; it's designed to be a conference room or worker-bee system, but it moonlights as an intriguing option for home-based workers. \nTwo things boost it above the crowd: a chic, stackable design, and options that equip it for double-duty as a conference phone. \nThe basic Slice is smaller than a Mac Mini . Optional add-on choices include the Collaboration Cover, which gives it conference call touch controls and a more powerful noise-cancelling microphone, and an Audio Module with Bang and Olufsen speakers that get louder than any conference phone I've ever had to listen to. In the absence of calling, the module upgrades the system's sound quality from ick to to decent. Other available modules include an optical drive (ODD) and a VESA-compatible mounting plate. The modules connect to the the Slice using internal USB-C, and it's easy to snap them on and off. An alternative version of the chassis has a fingerprint sensor. \nIf you have minimal computing needs, such as running email and an application or two at most, then the base configuration should be fine. Sadly, you can't customize the turnkey meeting-room model, which already comes with the two conference options, to bring it up to spec as a more serviceable PC. At the very least, I would avoid the traditional hard disk drive configurations; even with the 7,200 RPM drive in our evaluation system, the system boots painfully slowly, and I think it holds back the performance in general. (We didn't have recent performance results for comparable systems, but our test system performed more or less like a midrange business laptop.)
