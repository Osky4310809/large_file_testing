Besides looking and sounding the part, there's the range of targeted platforms -- PC, PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch -- and the joyous fact that the heroine has a ghost dog sidekick to help her get to otherwise out-of-reach areas.\nAlso, the game's origin story is rather cute:\n\"When Creative Director Christopher Obritsch's daughter Madelyn wanted to be in Ghouls 'n Ghosts , and fight 'Green Head', he said it was someone else's game - but he could make her one that was like it. 'But girls can't be knights, Daddy. Only boys…' she said, to which he answered 'Pshh…What color do you want your armor to be?'. The answer was pink. ;) And that's how this game started. Chris' daughter Madelyn loves the first stage of Ghouls ‘n Ghosts and makes him play it over and over because she wants to see him fight 'Green head', the Shielder boss at the end of the first stage. It's not hard for her to twist his rubber arm, as it's been his favorite game since it came out all those years ago.\"\nCasual Bit Games is planning a \"late 2017\" release and I'm so gonna play this on Switch.\n\nRead more...
