As a junior he bullied forwards into submission with his intercept play, while his size and pace also combined to make him just as dangerous when he played forward. \nThe question now for Carlton is: where should they play him? \nThe Blues recruited Weitering to fill a hole in defence. And that’s where he stayed for almost all of his 20 matches in his debut season of 2016. \nBut it has become apparent this preseason, if not beforehand, that Carlton is lacking fire power up forward. \nMatthew Wright was the club’s best goal kicker last year, with 22 majors. Bryce Gibbs was next best on 18. \nWeitering could provide the answer. \nAt 195cm, he has the presence. Not to mention the hands. \nAnd on Friday night — despite Carlton’s loss to Fremantle — he looked every bit the part with 17 possessions, nine marks and a goal. \nLive stream EVERY game of the 2017 NAB AFL Women’s competition   > Jacob Weitering looked dangerous up forward for Carlton.

He judges the ball so well. We know he’s a great field kick and we know he’s a great field kick. He’s exactly what they need. \n“They need someone who can get them eight marks per game, around 15 possessions through that half forward line to be the link up player. Let’s hope Weitering’s the guy for Carlton.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T14:39:35.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
