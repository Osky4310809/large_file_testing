In order for any peace agreement, in order for any possibility of a viable piece agreement to occur, there has to be a conversation with him. The Syrian people will determine his outcome and what happens with their government, and their future.” Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: “There has to be a conversation” with Assad https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/nV1ukfM4IU \n— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 25, 2017 \nWhen Tapper asked about moderate rebels in Syria fighting against Assad, Gabbard dismissed the very concept. \nEvery place that I went, every person that I spoke to, I asked this question to them, and without hesitation they said, ‘there are no moderate rebels, who are these moderate rebels that people keep speaking of?’ Regardless of the name of these groups, the strongest fighting force on the ground in Syria is al-Nusra, or al-Qaeda, or ISIS, that is a fact… \nThis is contentious issue because certain segments of Congress have advocated arming the more moderate of the rebels fighting against Assad, while others say there are no such moderates and that these arms would just fall to extremists like ISIS or al-Qaeda. Clearly, Rep. Gabbard is in the latter camp. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: People in Syria told me “there are no moderate rebels” https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/PAedy1LFea \n— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 25, 2017 \nThe exchange highlights one of the more difficult foreign policy legacies that former President Obama leaves to President Trump. Republicans have hounded Obama for pronouncing “Assad must go,’ and then allowing him to thumb his nose at America for five years while exacerbating the refugee crisis. The United States has accused Assad of war crimes, including the use of banned chemical weapons against the civilians in rebel-held regions. \nThis isn’t the first time Rep. Gabbard has advocated this position, but her seeking to strengthen her case by meeting with Assad is unusual. In 2015 she told Jake Tapper that we should not be seeking to topple Assad and that perhaps ISIS might not be as strong if the U.S. had kept from toppling other Middle East dictators. Gabbard also defended Trump on the nomination of military generals to his administration, citing her own military service as a reason for her opinion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:36:24.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
