He has been out of the league since February 2015, when the Bucks bought him out of the final three years of a four-year, $44 million contract. Benny Sieu/Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports \nHe met with the Cavaliers in late February, but they turned to Bogut first. Sanders, 28, was the 15th overall pick in the 2010 draft and reached his peak in 2012-13, when he averaged 9.8 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2.8 blocks as a rim protector for Milwaukee. That led to the big contract, but injuries, a bar fight that led to another injury, and two suspensions for violating the leagueâ€™s anti-drug policy limited him to only 50 games in the next two seasons. \nSanders held a seven-team workout in Miami last month, according to Yahoo Sports, and apparently the Cavaliers liked what they saw. Cleveland will have to waive a player to make room for Sanders on the roster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T10:28:17.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
