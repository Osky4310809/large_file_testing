It has been republished, with updates. \nSAN FRANCISCO — March 15 is the Ides of March. But there's no need to be on guard. \nJulius Caesar probably should have been. But then, he blew off the soothsayer who told him to \"beware the Ides of March\" in the first act of Shakespeare's play. \nYou might remember from English class that things didn't go so well for him. \nOut on Twitter, posters are using #idesofmarch to have some fun with the classic line dashed off 415 years ago. Shouldn't have let Brutus into the fridge... #idesOfMarch pic.twitter.com/KqV2Fnut3g — Chris Turner (@ctacoustics) March 15, 2017 Don't forget to watch your back today. #idesOfMarch pic.twitter.com/AXYQumTrUy — Robert Faulkner (@falknr) March 15, 2017 \nWhat if Shakespeare's soothsayer had simply said, \"Watch out a month from now!\" Would anybody remember the line? \n\"Ides of March\" has a better ring to it. And yet all it means is \"halfway through the month.\" \nIdes comes from an old Latin verb iduare , which meant \"to divide.\" It was the Roman term for the day that came in the middle of each month. \nEvery month has an Ides. March had 31 days, so the Ides of March is on March 15. \nJulius actually got several warnings. Later on in the play there's a big storm. To find out what it means, he sends a servant to get priests to sacrifice animals and read the omens in their entrails. \nTheir message is even clearer: Don't go out. \nIn best horror movie fashion he ignores them and, like an idiot, goes out. \nSo it's no surprise when Brutus and some other conspirators waylay him on the steps of the Capitol and stab him to death. \nBut unless it's 44 B.C., you're a Roman Consul and ignoring omens right and left, you should be just fine.
