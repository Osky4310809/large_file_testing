I spent the rest of the weekend carving hearts into them because Danielle has such a GINORMOUS heart. This who situation has been about hear, love, and support of one another, and how broken we feel without her.” \nMegan also indicates that she wants to create more than 4,000 buttons to represent all of the people currently missing in the state of Michigan. In addition, each button sent out includes a letter that is meant to highlight the fact that “there are over 90,000 people missing in America…” \nThe profit from the sale of the hand-carved buttons, according to Megan’s Etsy page, will be donated to Danielle’s family to help them in their quest to find her. \nThose who have ordered and received the buttons are posting photos of them on Facebook, as indicated on the Find Danielle Stislicki page. The Facebook page, dedicated to all things Danielle in an effort to find her and bring her home, is encouraging those who have obtained their buttons to take photos of them with a link so the images can be found, posted, and shared to spread the word about Danielle. \nThis is just one of many grassroots efforts that supporters of Danielle and her family have organized to help find her. As previously reported by the Inquisitr , last weekend marked 100 days that Danielle has been missing, and to highlight this a “ Pay It Forward ” weekend was organized to share her story. In addition, mini fliers are being placed in unusual locations to ensure the public is aware of Danielle’s case. \nAlthough police have announced that progress is being made in the case, not much else has been divulged to the public.
