Ahead of the Irish celebration on March 17, we reveal six other fascinating things you probably didn't know about Leprechauns: 1. They weren't all that friendly \nLeprechauns made their first appearance in an eighth-century poem. \nKing Fergus of Ulster was sleeping when the tiny, angry men sneakily tried to drag him into the ocean and drown him. Not that friendly: The early Leprechauns are said to have been untrustworthy, ‘trickster’ figures (Photo: Edera) \nThey only stopped when he woke up and captured them. \nUnsurprisingly then, the creatures are said to have been untrustworthy, ‘trickster’ figures who would deceive others whenever possible.

They didn't even live in Ireland \nYes, you read that right. \nAccording to early tales, Leprechauns lived in an undersea kingdom in the Mid-Atlantic, says Tom O’Donnell, a UCL researcher in Medieval Irish. Read More Bad news Superman - scientists may have discovered how to make 'kryptonite' \nThe creatures can be traced back to old legends of water spirits called ‘luchorpán,’ meaning ‘small body’. \nAnd even today, they aren’t just restricted to Ireland – with a colony of Leprechauns said to exist in an official city park in Portland, Oregon.

They were ALL male \nIrish folklore suggests there were no female Leprechauns… at all. \nAccording to the ancient book, A History Of Irish Fairies, there is only evidence of the existence of male Leprechauns. \nWe’re not entirely sure what the deal was with procreation. Read More \nHowever, some believe that Leprechauns were the ‘defective offspring’ of fairies. \nOthers think the creatures may have come from unions between humans and fairies. 4. They wouldn't fix your shoes \nThe best you could hope for was that they'd help you breathe underwater. \nThe Leprechauns gave King Fergus that ability – provided he wore one of their cloaks on his head, or put herbs in his ears. Magical: The Leprechauns wouldn't fix your shoes - but they may have been able to help you breathe underwater (Photo: Matt Brown) \nHowever, the power did not apply to one particular lake – which of course, turned out to be the place the king had to fight a monster and later drowned.
