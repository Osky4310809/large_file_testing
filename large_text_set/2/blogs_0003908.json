So that in itself is a fabulous, wonderful thing,” Kennedy said. “We’ve never seen people outside [Senator Pat] Toomey’s office. That’s miraculous. Let’s keep it up. So we’re here to encourage that action.” \nPHOTOS: Anti-Immigration Policy Protest In Center City \nBut just how effective are these gatherings? \n“We know political mobilization of people influences politicians, it influences people and it works,” Kennedy said. “I mean, you need to have a critical mass and we’re starting to see that build.” \nAnd organization general secretary Shan Cretin says it’s up to protesters to use their privilege to push for what’s right. \n“And if we stand up, it doesn’t really matter what executive order gets signed,” Cretin said, “it won’t be able to be implemented.” Massive demonstration going on in Center City Philadelphia @KYWNewsradio pic.twitter.com/BSeNq2ZE6m Hadas Kuznits Follow Hadas Kuznits has been as a news writer/reporter for KYW Newsradio since September 2002, and has traveled the city — and the world — while covering stories for Newsradio.
