STAR/Marvin Sy \nMANILA, Philippines â€”   appears to have only lost his American citizenship last month, a member of the   said Wednesday. \nCA member and  Sato questioned why Yasay refuses to admit that he once acquired an American citizenship. \n\"I do not understand, Mr. Chairman, why the honorable secretary cannot admit to this commission that he was an American citizen and he only lost his American citizenship in February of 2017,\" Ramirez-Sato said during the confirmation hearing of the secretary. \nBased on documents that Yasay submitted, he personally appeared before a consular officer of the United States on June 28, 2016 to renounce his American citizenship. \nThe US has to officially announce the approval of a citizen's renunciation before officially losing American citizenship, Ramirez-Santos said. \n\"You have to wait that the United States of America has to announce the approval of your renunciation and that happened only on February 9, 2017 when in the official of the United States of America through the US Internal Revenue Service released a list of citizens who have lost their US citizenship,\" the lawmaker said.   \nRamirez-Sato said that Yasay might have been still an American citizen when he was appointed as Security and Exchange Commission chairman in 1995 and when he ran for senator in 2004 and as vice president in 2010. \nAsked why he refuses to admit that he was an American citizen, Yasay said, \"I am not in a position to belabor the point of the legal nuances of what I have said.\" \nYasay had claimed that the US granted him citizenship on Nov. 28, 1986 but such grant was \"void ab initio\" on the basis that he had preconceived intent to return to the Philippines. \nRamirez-Sato then asked who declared that the US citizenship granted to Yasay was void. \n\"He said that US citizenship granted to him was 'void ab initio' but the question now is who declared your citizenship 'void ab initio.' Your mere intention would void the grant of American citizenship?\" Ramirez-Sato said. \nCiting the Immigration and Nationality Act of the US, Yasay said that anyone with a preconceived intent to abandon his residency at the time of the application and grant of citizenship is disqualified, making it null and void. \n\"The process is you are supposed to be subject to the naturalization proceedings as a basis to remove your citizenship on that disqualification. However, I precisely voluntarily admitted that I was disqualified and that avoided the denaturalization proceedings that would have subjected me thereafter to deportation,\" Yasay said. \nRamirez-Sato then slammed the secretary for \"fooling\" the US when he applied for citizenship when he had no intent of permanently residing in the country. \nDuring the time of his application, Yasay only had the intent of returning to the Philippines when ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos was no longer in the country. The secretary said that he made up his mind when he saw the changed conditions in the country. \n\"You might call it and I admit there was... a misrepresentation there on my part for not divulging that and this is precisely what the law is all about when it says preconceived intent and intention to abandon your residency and I submitted myself to American law on this point,\" Yasay said. \nThe secretary has apologized for any \"inadvertent misleading\" statements that he made before the panel regarding his citizenship status. \nCA members held a secret voting on whether to confirm or reject Yasay's appointment. The panel has yet to announce their decision.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T08:51:28.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
