Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMillions of homes face eye-watering council tax rises in April as the Tories pass the buck for their failure to fund social care properly. \nResearch today revealed at least 28 of the biggest councils are planning to raise bills by 4.99% - the maximum possible without putting it to a vote. \nThat is set to pile at least £50 onto many household bills in those areas. \nThe list includes some of the largest city councils in England - among them Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Nottingham, Rotherham and Hull. \nRural shires taking the hit were said to include Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and South Gloucestershire.

Manchester is among the councils seeking a 4.99% rise, according to the Sunday Times (Photo: Getty) \nThe list was compiled by the Sunday Times, which said at least 41 town halls planned to raise bills by more than 4%. \nMore are set to emerge when other councils finalise their budgets later this month. \nTheresa May gave councils permission to raise bills by 3% in 2017/18 and another 3% in 2018/19 to plug the social care funding gap, on top of the 1.99% rise already allowed. \nBut the GMB union branded the measure a \"postcode lottery\" while Labour called it a \"short-term sticking plaster\". \nThe Local Government Association (LGA) has warned there is a £2.6bn black hole that could force cuts to libraries, museums and Sure Start centres. The council tax hikes are a \"postcode lottery\" because each area has a different rate (Photo: Getty) \nClaire Kober of the LGA said previously: “Only genuinely new additional government funding for social care will give councils any chance of protecting the services caring for our elderly and disabled.” \nLib Dem health spokesman Norman Lamb warned using council tax was \"unfair\" because the lump sum tax hits low-income homes and badly-funded regions the hardest. \nHe said today: \"This just reinforces the absolute need to confront this properly rather than endless sticking plaster solutions as we lurch from crisis to crisis.\" Read More \nHikes of 5% or more are allowed if approved in a local referendum. So far one council, Surrey, has gone down that path with plans for a 15% rise. Norman Lamb said making council taxpayers foot the bill was \"unfair\" (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nThe rises apply to the 'precept' (slice of total council tax) charged by unitary, county, metropolitan or London councils. \nThe rest of a home's total bill is made up of smaller charges from police, firefighters and district, borough or parish councils. \nIn Manchester, for example, the city council's precept for a Band D home is set to rise by around £51 from £1,219 in 2016/17 to £1,280 in 2017/18. \nThe remaining £216 of last year's Band D bill was made up of funds for the police and fire services. Police forces can also ask for a 2% rise. Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T19:02:07.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
