People of all generations united in Washington DC and hundreds of other cities. \nI went to DC with my mom and aunt. We all went to Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration together, so it felt really fitting for us feminists to be with each other for this event. \nWe met up with my sister, who was volunteering, making it an extra meaningful show of togetherness. It felt like we were there for each other — and for women all over the country. \nI quickly found out I wasn’t the only woman marching with my mother. \nHere are 11 mother-daughter duos who went to the Women’s March on Washington together (and full disclosure, some of these women are my friends). “This march is a pledge to each other.” Mariel O’Connell \nNeither of us thought it possible that an unapologetic misogynist could be elected president — and when the impossible happened, we both felt it was important to stand together so that both generations could draw strength from the other and fight for the future and the daughters to come. \nThis March is a pledge to each other that we will continue to stand against bigotry and sexism that we see in our lives and in our government in the coming years. \nAs women, our activism is as important as ever, and we will make sure we are there together to combat it. The march means more than one day — it is a symbol of all we have to do over the next four years and beyond. \nI’ve never been prouder to be my mother’s daughter. She took on a group of Westboro-style counter-protesters with a fierceness I’ve never seen. It was inspiring and showed me how loud I’m allowed to be, and should be, when combatting hate! \n– Mariel O’Connell (daughter) \nMariel and Pam O’Connell drove to DC from New York City. “We believe in an America that lives up to its ideals.” Gretchen Gardner \nWe march to stand up to Mr. Trump’s callous disregard for human rights and decency, and because we believe in an America that lives up to its ideals and Constitutional principles. \n— Gretchen Gardner (daughter) \nGretchen came from Los Angeles and her mother, Christina, from Virginia. They hosted a breakfast the morning of the March. “We know that love trumps hate.” Camille Richardson \nThe March showed the strength of marginalized voices and their allies. We know that love trumps hate, and [we] exercised our right march in solidarity with all who demand justice. \n— Camille Richardson (daughter) \nCamille lives in New York and joined her mother, Anita Friday, in Pennsylvania to travel to the March. They traveled with Anita’s book club. “It was so empowering.” Annie Baldridge \nI work in international development and am working with the Lawyers for Good Government group to oppose the administration. My mom, Mary Baldridge, is a teacher for Fairfax County schools. \nShe said the last time she did a big protest march was the anti Vietnam war demonstration in 1969 with her mom! It was so empowering to march with the woman who raised me to be the strong self reliant feminist I am. \n— Annie Baldridge (daughter) \nAnnie traveled from Vancouver to march with her mother, Mary Baldridge. “I hope that that energy can be put to daily/weekly acts.” Deborah Peltz \nThe energy that is created when we stand up for ourselves and others is so powerful. I hope that that energy can be put to daily/weekly acts of powerful action so that we might turn this thing around. \n— Deborah Peltz (mother) \nDeborah, who lives in Chicago, signed up for the March on Washington as soon as she heard about it — before the Chicago March was announced. She joined her daughter, Madeline, who lives in DC. “We must act in the face of injustice.” Rosie Lourentzatos \nMy mother taught me as a young girl that we must act in the face of injustice. We marched to raise our voices against injustice. We marched because we believe there is a better world for all of us. \nWe marched to show the younger generations that they deserve to live in a society where everybody is accepted for who they are. \n— Rosie Lourentzatos (daughter) \nRosie and her mother, Connie, traveled to DC from New York. “Civic engagement is really important to both of us.” Maddy Wilson \nBeing at the March in DC, surrounded by such a positive, energetic crowd was so inspiring, and being fortunate enough to share it with each other made it truly special. Civic engagement is really important to both of us, and we walked away from the March with hope for the next four years and ideas for more ways to be involved together. \nI can’t imagine having marched without my badass, feminist mom next to me! \n— Maddy Wilson (daughter) \nMaddy traveled from New York and joined her mother, Jennie Smith Wilson, who traveled from New Jersey. “We will not be silent.” Morgan Cross \nI marched with my mom because multiple generations of women (and men) banding together to have their voices heard is exceptionally powerful. \nAfter witnessing an unprecedented presidential campaign fueled by hateful rhetoric and a blatant disregard for the truth, we will not be silent and allow that to become acceptable in society. \n— Morgan Cross (daughter) \nMorgan came to the march from Maryland and joined her mother, Pam Harries, from Virginia. “My mom and I marched to celebrate a historic moment.” Paige Nichols \nAs I emerged from my post-election fog, I was looking for an impetus to act, to do something, to counter the feelings of helplessness that had overtaken me. \nWhen I saw the information about the March developing on Facebook, it all clicked, and in a rather capricious moment, I texted my mom to see what she thought. Within 48 hours I had my ticket booked and [had] my Nasty Woman shirt at the ready! \nI was inspired by the spirit of unity and resistance and wanted to make sure my voice was heard. My mom and I marched to celebrate a historic moment of female empowerment and to ensure that this legacy is carried on for future generations. DC is my hometown, and I was energized and galvanized by the experience. \nMy mom roasted a turkey breast and made some sandwiches for us to have; she put a note on them in the fridge that read “Activist Food!” because that’s how she rolls. \n— Paige Nichols (daughter) \nPaige traveled from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to join her mom, Debbie Nichols, at the March. “I am filled with hope as I see the next generation of women rise up.” Molly Cain \nWe chose to march together to fight for equal rights for women, people of color, people with disabilities, Muslims and all other marginalized people, as well as to unify with others combat the hate in the Trump administration. \n— Molly Cain (daughter) \nI am filled with hope as I see the next generation of women rise up and join those of us who have been protesting for decades. We will not stop, we will not go back and we have raised strong women and men who have joined the fight! So proud to have been at this historic event with my daughter! \n— Mary (mother) \nMolly marched with her mother, Dr. Mary Eagle from Delaware. They marched with Molly’s cousin and aunt, who came from Vermont and New York, respectively. “To show them the importance of standing up for their rights.” Janie Jackson \nI marched with my three daughters to show them the importance of standing up for their rights as girls/women, and also to support the rights of ALL humans, regardless of gender, race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation or identity. \n— Janie Jackson (mother) \nJanie traveled from Virginia with her daughters Caroline, Lauren and Anna. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
