Estimates are shifting around, rising in some places, falling in others.\nThe overwhelming sentiment seems to be relief. Which points to a desire to look through the current quarter, and the next, to other things, the main ones being potential tax reform that could bring a windfall of repatriated earnings to Apple; an increase in the capital returns program; and the looming prospect of “ iPhone X ,” the Street’s pet name for Apple’s tenth-anniversary iPhone.\nAs Jeffrey Kvaal with Instinet put it this morning, “Investors are now freer to look ahead to the impending iPhone X cycle—and strong growth in the iOS base portends well.”\nSome views:\nTim Long, BMO Capital : Reiterates an Outperform rating, and riase this price target to $142 from $135. “March guidance is a little less impressive, but we believe sentiment will depend more on potential tax reforms and the assumed September iPhone refresh […] Services continue to be an important part of the story, as continued App Store growth helped drive 21% like-for-like Services growth. We have been expecting strength here, owing to the growing installed base of new and used iPhones. Management expects the revenue contribution from Services to double in four years, which represents nearly twice the growth rate we had been modeling.” Long trims his 2017 estimates to $228.43 billion and $8.99 per share from a prior $230.92 billion and $9.05.\nAbhey Lamba, Mizuho Securities USA : Reiterates a Buy rating, and raises his price target to $135 from $130. “The company’s F2Q outlook showed modest downside to revenue estimates but seemed better than feared. We like what we see and remain positive about the upcoming upgrade cycle opportunity given strong installed base growth [...] Management also indicated strong double-digit growth in the installed base as it capitalized on the issues at Samsung and attracted meaningful new users.” Lamba raises his 2017 estimates to $224 billion and $8.53 per share from a prior $223.5 billion and $8.53.\nMark Moskowitz, Barclays : Reiterates an Equal Weight rating, and raises his price target to $123 from $117. “With iPhone, the mix toward IP7 plus was bigger than expected, but consolidated gross margin did not exhibit a commensurate lift. Major ASR buy back activity and outsized OI&E also helped EPS, minimizing the quality of the EPS beat. Adjusting for the extra week (~5.6M units), we estimate the 5% Y/Y growth in iPhone unit sales could be closer to flat to down, meaning the franchise still faces long-term growth hurdles. The stock stands to be upward trending in the near term as investors focus on the next capital return authorization later this spring.” Moskowitz raises his calendar 2017 estimates to $230.64 billion and $9.03 per share from a prior $227.67 billion and $8.99.\nSimona Jankowski , Goldman Sachs : Reiterates a Buy rating, and a $133 price target. “While the 14th week was clearly a boost to the quarter, we nonetheless view this quarter as a meaningful improvement for the iPhone segment, and expect continued yoy growth through the end of FY17 [...] The beat would have been even stronger had it not been for a supplier shortage in the iPad, which contributed to a $1.3bn iPad revenue miss.” Jankowski cuts her 2017 estimates to $229 billion and $9.10 per share from a prior $231.95 billion and $9.31 per share.\nKaty Huberty, Morgan Stanley : Reiterates a Buy rating, and raises her price target to $150 from $148. “We’re increasingly convinced Street estimates are too low for FY18. iPhone returned to growth despite no major form factor change and currency headwinds during the December quarter. iPhone engagement and loyalty rates remain high, supported by 21% Services revenue growth (backing out $548M litigation benefit a year ago). New OLED displays, improved battery technology, and a redesigned form factor at the high-end of the portfolio are likely to accelerate upgrade rates in FY18 […] Our FY17e Revenue and EPS both increase 2% to $221B and $8.61, respectively. FY18e also increases on higher Services growth to $257B revenue (from $255B) and $10.70 EPS (from $10.56).”\nToni Sacconaghi, Bernstein Research: Reiterates an Outperform rating, and a $140 price target. “We believe that Q2 guidance may be conservative, given that it implies iPhone unit declines of about 27% sequentially (adjusting for the extra week), notably below normal seasonality. We also note that Apple spent $11B on buybacks in the quarter – historically, our analysis suggests that meaningful repurchases are a positive leading indicator for the stock. Apple set a goal for it to double its services business over the next 4 years, which we believe will require that the company introduce new services offerings. That said, the goal is meaningful given Services’ high margins, which may be able offset 80 – 130 bps of annual iPhone margin degradation, all else being equal, going forward.”\nLaura Martin, Needham & Co. : Reiterates a Strong Buy rating, and a $150 price target. “Many of APPL’s devices were sold out in the December quarter, including 7+ iPhone, several tablets, and the Apple Watch, suggesting unit sales could have been higher. Services revenue was strong and we continue to view the AAPL ecosystem’s primary competitive advantage as an environment that drives productivity, creativity and engagement any time, in or out of home, for consumers globally. AAPL has been forced to raise prices by 20-40% over the past several years to offset US dollar currency appreciation of 25%. This implies unit sales would have been stronger if the dollar had been flat.” Martin raises her 2017 estimates to $228.16 billion and $9.02 per share from a prior $228.12 billion and $8.98 per share.\nKulbinder Garcha, Credit Suisse : Reiterates an Outperform rating, and a $150 price target. “espite FX issues, negative leverage and potentially less licensing support, we believe consistently delivering GM at around 38.5% is supportive of the story. While we do expect further headwinds ahead such as rising BOM costs and FX, we believe potential price hikes and rising Services contributions can absorb them. We model GM at 39%%/40% in CY17/CY18.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:12:24.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
