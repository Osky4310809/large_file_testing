For many reasons sometimes the chemistry just isn’t there. \nMost of us realize this and just chalk it up to experience and move on with our lives not giving it much of a second thought. It happens.\nThat attitude seemed to be the way this man and woman were going to handle things when the woman texted the guy, Imgur user mwasbabu16 , to say, “I really don’t see you as a romantic partner but I hope we can be friends. I hope I didn’t get your hopes up.”\nNice, huh? Civil and to the point. \nSo did he blow a gasket after being rejected? \nNope. He responded, very reasonably, “No, not at all.

Not bad at all, I tell you.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:29:42.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
