Or the move might set a trend. \nThe archipelago’s economic growth was expected to top the rest of Southeast Asia at 6.7% last year in part because of new foreign investment. Call centers set up by multinationals, for example, added an estimated $25 billion to the economy last year after more than a decade of growth, and Japanese manufacturers are expanding industrial zones near Manila. Consumption and remittances from overseas workers also contributed heavily to the Philippine GDP that the IMF says probably reached $311 billion in 2016. \nDuterte’s public approval rating hit 86% in October, months after he took office, largely because Filipinos see crime rates dropping as well as the economy growing. No wonder the president of about half a year could say in public last month that he personally killed people as 22-year mayor of the country’s second largest city Davao and face little backlash at home. His presidential campaign against drugs has killed an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 people, according to common estimates. \nContrast that political and economic momentum with music hall-of-famer Taylor’s withdrawal to “make a political stand,” as he said, against the extrajudicial killings. The singer-songwriter's move rings petty. \n\"From my side, I really doubt MNCs will be discouraged from investing in the Philippines because of the drug war,\" says Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist with the French investment bank Natixis. \"All that matters to them is growth and profits.\" \nYet the cancelled concert could be the first domino to fall. You probably wouldn’t see much impact at first. Foreign direct investment, largely from Japan and the West, came to just 2% of GDP in 2015, according to World Bank figures. Duterte's spokesman said that last month foreign partnerships added to growth in 2016. MANILA, PHILIPPINES - DECEMBER 23: A man lies dead on the ground after being shot by motorcycle riding men on December 23, 2016 in Manila, Philippines. Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has said he wanted the Constitution amended to allow Philippine leaders to wield martial law powers without judicial and congressional approval, a move he said is necessary to contain the ongoing 'drug menace' and maintain peace and security in the country.

Some media reports say American businesses have already left. The U.S. government has criticized the suspected drug-linked killings, prompting outrage from Duterte. \nThe American Chamber of Commerce in Manila told Forbes in a statement Tuesday that the “issue of extrajudicial killings and the drug war is alarming and could possibly harm the optimism of American business to invest in the country.” Not only the American chamber has raised concern. \n“There could be a risk to growth because of investor sentiment, and investor sentiment has been getting cloudier given the political situation,” says Christian de Guzman, vice president and senior credit officer with Moody’s in Singapore. “From the foreign investor perspective, you’ve heard industry bodies and foreign chambers of commerce are concerned about the law and order situation. That can be a hindrance to further foreign investment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T05:53:55.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
