As ponies mature they gain cutie marks on their flanks, which represent their purpose or calling in life. Pony kinds Edit \nThere are three main types of ponies: Earth ponies : regular ponies. The founders of Ponyville were among this race. They are closer to nature than other ponies and frequently tend to crops and perform manual labor. They have no wings or horns. Pegasi or Pegasus ponies: ponies with wings who can fly and walk on clouds. They frequently tend to the weather. Unicorns : ponies that have horns and possess more pronounced magical abilities, represented by a glow around their horn when used. Many use telekinesis, but some use other kinds of magic as well. \nOutside of the three kinds, Princess Celestia, Princess Luna , Princess Cadance , Twilight Sparkle and Flurry Heart possess Pegasus wings, a unicorn horn, and, depending on the depiction, Earth pony magic. They are called Alicorns in the show. Both Celestia and Luna possess extraordinary magical power, allowing them to raise the sun and the moon. Cadance has the power of love which, according to Twilight, allows her to spread love wherever she goes and can quell the fighting in two ponies' hearts. Twilight has the ability to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. Flurry Heart is a naturally-born Alicorn. Age and sex Edit \nThe show's ponies may be grouped by age and sex into colts (younger males), fillies (younger females), mares (older females), and stallions (older males). A pony's sex can be ascertained by the shape and size of their muzzle: stallions' muzzles are angular, squared off and larger, while mares' muzzles have a more rounded appearance and are much smaller than a stallion's. However, this is not the case with some Alicorns. Stallions also have bigger and sometimes bulkier bodies than mares. Another way to determine a pony's sex is by their eyelashes and that mares' hooves are the same color as their coat, while some stallions' hooves are coatless, like Big McIntosh 's, Shining Armor 's, or Prince Blueblood 's. Mares and fillies have eyelashes, while stallions and colts don't. However, baby ponies have eyelashes, with males having a single eyelash, and females having two. In Lauren Faust 's head, [19] at least one [20] S1 pony character [21] is trans . [22] \nIn previous My Little Pony generations, all young ponies were often called \"baby ponies\", while in Friendship is Magic young ponies and baby ponies are differentiated. Young ponies are simply called \"fillies\" or \"young ponies\", and are grouped with baby ponies under foals . \nThe ages of the main characters have been left \"imprecise\" by the show's developer, Lauren Faust. [23] Faust said that she thinks of the main characters as anywhere from 12 to 17 but gives them \"adult independence.\" [24] Main characters Edit From left to right: Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Fluttershy, Spike and Applejack.

Season one Edit \nSeason one opened with a \"preview\", an early screening of the entire first episode five days before the series \"officially\" started, to coincide with the launch of the television channel The Hub. The introduction of the characters and the plot revolving around Nightmare Moon span over the first two episodes, which together comprise the only two-parter of the season. Episode three introduces the Grand Galloping Gala, which is where the season's final episode takes place. The show's developer, Lauren Faust , served as executive producer for this season. All of season one's episodes are rated e/i for \"educational and informative\". \nThis season focuses mainly on Twilight and her getting used to Ponyville as well as the cementing of the friendship between the Mane 6 as well as the Cutie Mark Crusaders in the latter half of the seasons. Season two Edit \nFaust announced that she has been less involved in the making of the show for season two, focusing mostly on story conception and script. She is credited under \"Developed for Television by\" and \"Executive Producer\" for the first and second episodes, which were produced during the first season's production span. She is credited as \"Consulting Producer\" for the rest of season two. [27] \nThe season consists of 26 episodes, 22 minutes in length. Several minor characters return in this season, including Derpy , Princess Luna , and Mr. Greenhooves , as well as the school-age ponies , Cheerilee , and the Cutie Mark Crusaders . The season started airing on September 17, 2011. Like the first season, it opened with a two-parter with the ponies questing for the Elements of Harmony. Episodes 11, 12, and 13 were not aired in production order: episode 13, Hearth's Warming Eve , was aired before episodes 11 and 12, Family Appreciation Day and Baby Cakes , respectively, to be in time for the holiday season. They are listed on the wiki according to air date order. Season two has concluded on April 21, 2012 with the two-parter finale, A Canterlot Wedding . \nStarting with the episode Lesson Zero, Princess Celestia exempts Twilight from submitting a report every week, and asks that all six ponies make reports about their findings on the magic of friendship when they come upon them, which reduces the show's emphasis on Twilight's friendship lessons . We Heart Ponies Fan Favorite Mare-a-Thon \nA few weeks prior to the airing of Hearts and Hooves Day , The Hub announced it would be airing a \"We Heart Ponies Fan Favorite Mare-a-Thon\" consisting of nine episodes selected by the fans. The nine episodes were aired directly before Hearts and Hooves Day. The nine episodes were, in order of appearance: Luna Eclipsed , Green Isn't Your Color , The Best Night Ever , Suited For Success , May the Best Pet Win! , Party of One , Lesson Zero , Feeling Pinkie Keen , and Hearth's Warming Eve . Season three Edit \nThe third season premiered on the 10th of November, 2012, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time. [28] The Hub has placed an order for thirteen episodes, [29] but despite the season being shorter than the first two, the show's composer, William Anderson, hinted at the presence of further seasons, of different lengths. [30] Writers Meghan McCarthy, Cindy Morrow, M.A. Larson and Dave Polsky are returning to the show, though story editor for the first and second seasons Rob Renzetti is replaced by Meghan McCarthy, [31] who has been called \"showrunner\" in an April 2012 article in the online edition of the L.A. Times. [32] Two songs from the third season have been publically screened by Hasbro prior to their official airing: The Failure Song , which was screened at ComicCon 2012, and The Ballad of the Crystal Empire , which was published on YouTube. A clip from the season's premiere episode was debuted on Facebook . The season finale, Magical Mystery Cure , aired on February 16, 2013. Season four Edit \nFor a brief period in early February, Daniel Ingram , the show's music composer, had season four listed on his résumé and a total of 91 episodes for the show, leaving 26 episodes for the fourth season after the 65 episodes of previous seasons. At the Las Pegasus Unicon convention on 20 February 2013, Meghan McCarthy said that season four's production is \"in full swing\". Season four premiered on November 23, 2013. [33] An animatic showing clips from three episodes as well as a new song from a fourth episode was shown at the San Diego Comic Con in July. [34] Additionally, on October 23, 2013, The Hub Network released a synopsis of the the first two episodes of season four on their website. [35] Unlike previous seasons, season four is a season long story arc involving a chest with six keys. [36] The season finale is the two-parter episodes Twilight's Kingdom , which aired on May 10, 2014. My Little Pony Mega Mare-A-Thon Edit \nFrom August 4, 2014 to August 8, 2014, Hub Network ran a \"My Little Pony Mega Mare-A-Thon\", in which all episodes from seasons one to four were aired in the order they originally premiered. Coupled with the five-day event were \"Ask a Pony\" commercial bumps in which the Mane 6 answer fan questions, My Little Pony Equestria Girls , and three Generation 3 My Little Pony specials: My Little Pony: Twinkle Wish Adventure , My Little Pony: The Princess Promenade , and My Little Pony Crystal Princess: The Runaway Rainbow . Season five Edit \nIn an interview with WorldScreen.com, Stephen Davis, president of Hasbro Studios, stated about Friendship is Magic , \"We are now going into our fifth season—just a tremendous success for us.\" [37] In May 2014, the Hub Network stated on Twitter and Facebook that season five is \"coming 2015\". [38] [39] A May 7, 2014 article on Examiner.com states that season five will consist of 26 episodes. [40] An animatic showing a four-minute-long clip from a new episode was shown at the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014. [41] On November 17, 2014, a teaser for the fifth season was uploaded to the official MLP YouTube channel, with a date of Spring 2015. [42] Season five premiered April 4, 2015. This is the first season to premiere on the rebranded Discovery Family channel.

[44] Jim Miller stated in a Twitter reply regarding this on March 31, 2015, \"I think that's a typo.\" [45] Hours later, \" #MLPseason6 \" was tweeted by both Meghan McCarthy [46] and Michael Vogel , [47] and both \"Don't believe it. #MLPseason6 #conspiracy \" and \"Believe? #MLPSeason6 pic.twitter.com/GcHUkEjPHu \" were tweeted by Josh Haber . [48] [49] Miller later confirmed the announcement to be true on Twitter. [50] On July 8, 2015, Hasbro stated on Twitter that season six would be \"coming later this year\" [51] but the following day, it was revealed to be an error. [52] On September 19, 2015, Miller confirmed via Twitter that there will be 26 episodes for this season. [53] \nA January 28, 2016 press release by Yahoo! TV states that \"Season 6 of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic will premiere on Discovery Family this spring.\" [54] During Hasbro's Toy Fair 2016 presentation, a premiere date of May 2016 was announced; [55] however, a Discovery Family promo later confirmed the premiere date for March 26, 2016. At a press showing at the 2016 Toy Fair, Hasbro previewed some animatics of season 6 episodes. They featured new griffon and dragon characters [56] and a new Hearth's Warming Eve-themed song.

The marathon will consist of the second half of season six, Equestria Girls , Rainbow Rocks , Friendship Games , and Legend of Everfree . Season seven Edit \nLeah Jade in early March 2016 after meeting with DHX [58] tweeted that \"season 7 of MLP is in production\" [59] and in mid-April 2016 stated that she would remove said tweet if not OK to post. [60] Later in mid-April 2016, Jim Miller was asked regarding the matter and replied, \"We're still working on 6!\", [61] and Jade removed her relevant tweet. On April 29, 2016, Miller was asked, \"Do you know if there will be a season 7 of mlp[ sic ]?\", and replied, \"That's Hasbro's decision to make.\" [62] On October 4, 2016, World Screen reported, \"Next year will also see the premiere of a new season of the hit TV show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic ,\" [63] and Equestria Daily quoted Hasbro PR, \"Hasbro can confirm that My Little Pony Friendship is Magic is not switching to Netflix for Season 7.\" [64] On October 18, 2016, Hasbro reported through a press release that season seven would air on Discovery Family in Spring 2017.
