The Blues boss believes that Cahill displays the finishing ability of a striker and told Cahill to make up for giving away a first half penalty on Saturday afternoon. \n\"For me, Gary, he can play also as a centre forward,\" Conte said to a group of journalists after the vital win. \"He has a good quality, he is acrobatic, he is very good during corners and set-pieces. \n\"I am pleased for him because we conceded the penalty because the referee saw a little push on Gary and then I told him to find the solution to win. This had finished the game. \n\"It is a difficult moment to remember this because me and all the players we celebrated a great win. I repeat, this is a great win.\" \nDavid Luiz: Chelsea still have long way \nConte's side have now dropped points in just three of their last 22 league games, which has led them to becoming strong favourites for the Premier League title. Conte believes that his side have a winning mentality and that they can motivate themselves against any opposition. \n\"When you want to win the league, it is important to not drop points,\" he said. \"Above all, when you play against a team who are not a top team. In the middle [of the table] or at the bottom, it is important to keep a continuity in the results. The name of this is a winning mentality.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T09:54:31.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
