Sources suggest the studio is keen to expand the Matrix’s universe in the manner of Disney and Lucasfilm’s recent updates to the Star Wars franchise. Zak Penn, the screenwriter and creator of sci-fi series Alphas, is said to be in talks to write an initial treatment. The Matrix: No 13 best sci-fi and fantasy film of all time Read more \nThe first Matrix film was created by the Wachowski siblings and starred Keanu Reeves as Neo, a computer programmer who learns that he and the rest of humanity have been trapped inside a simulated version of reality by sentient machines, and leads a rebellion against his robot overlords. It also featured Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne. Released in 1999, the film immediately became a critical and commercial hit, spawning two less well-received sequels. It has also become enormously influential, with its “ bullet time ” special effects revolutionising action film-making and receiving numerous homages on screen. Keanu Reeves: ‘I don’t know, man. John Wick is fun’ – video interview \nThere is no word as to whether Reeves or the Wachowskis would be involved in the new version. Sources told the Hollywood Reporter that there was interest in Michael B Jordan , The Wire and Creed actor, starring in the film. \nReeves has expressed interest in returning in a further instalment of the franchise, but only if the Wachowskis were involved in its creation. “They would have to write it and direct it. And then we’d see what the story is,”he told Yahoo Movies last month.
