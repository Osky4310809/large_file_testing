Here are the best Android apps to sell stuff!\nCheck out these awesome posts!   10 best Facebook apps for Android June 18, 2016   10 best shopping apps for Android March 10, 2016 5miles Price: Free / $39.99 per month DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY 5miles is an one one of the more popular apps to sell stuff. It's an online marketplace where you can post your stuff to have it sold. It uses GPS and zip code to show your post to people in your area. Additionally, it has Facebook integration, built-in seller-buyer messaging, and more. It's fairly easy to use as well. This is definitely good for those who want to sell things on Craigslist and also want another place to post it as well. Some people have experienced issues, but most seem to enjoy the experience well enough. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Amazon Seller Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Amazon Seller is for those who want to take this seriously. The app allows you to manage your Amazon seller account. You'll have to create your account on Amazon's website. Otherwise, you can do most of the stuff in the app. Included with the app is a photo studio where you can get pictures of your stuff. Additionally, you can respond to messages, start special offers, and do plenty of other stuff. It's a little over the top if you only want to sell one or two things. However, it's good to have this just in case you want to sell more than that. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Close5 Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Close5 is a lot like 5miles. It's one of those GPS and zip code based apps to sell stuff. It doesn't offer as polished of an experience as other sites, but it is very fast. You can list things very quickly. However, there isn't a description or price required for posting. That can make things kind of confusing. It has built-in seller-buyer messaging, Facebook integration for quick account creation, and more. It's not very well-known and it seems to have a bit of a scammer problem from time to time. Just remember to be cautious and never wire people money. You should be fine. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY eBay Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY eBay is the king of apps to sell stuff. People and companies have been using eBay for years to sell their things and it's one of the most trusted names in the genre. It comes with a couple of ways to sell your stuff (auction or Buy It Now), various security features, and you can do everything in the app that you can on the website. There really isn't a limit to what you can sell on eBay. Even the listings are generally more informative and helpful than smaller sites. It's a pain to get set up if you don't have an account for some reason, but otherwise it's pretty fantastic. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Sell on Etsy Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Etsy is a great place to sell some of your stuff. It's a website for artists and tinkerers where you can sell homemade art, crafts, and various other objects. It's not the kind of place where you'd sell a couch or a TV. However, if you have some paintings or some oven mitts that you made, this is a good place to go. The app itself works pretty well and you can even use it to sell things in person. It also comes with order management, listing management, and you can talk to potential buyers. It's not a bad place to go for independent artists.

January 1, 2017   10 best productivity apps for Android May 11, 2016 Facebook Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Facebook is also getting into the apps to sell stuff market. Semi-recent updates have included a new marketplace feature. You can browse and search there to find goods based on your location. Similarly, you can post your stuff on there and hope that someone takes an interest. It's kind of like they built the sell section of Craigslist right into Facebook. Since many people use the Facebook app anyway, why not try to sell something there too? The only downside is we're not sure how many people actually know about the marketplace feature on Facebook so we don't know how many people will see it. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Letgo Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Letgo is one of the larger apps to sell stuff. With over ten million downloads (at least), there is a good sized audience of people to sell yourself to. It features a clean interface, simple posting, and plenty of additional features. It boasts an AI built-in that tries to categorize and name your items without your input to make things easier. You can even chat with potential buyers and sellers to get things worked out. It's not perfect, but people seem to enjoy using it. Give it a shot and see if it works for you. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY OfferUp Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY OfferUp is another one of the local apps to sell stuff. You can post your stuff relatively quickly or browser around for stuff that's already there. On top of the basics, the app also allows people to earn reputation points for being good sellers. This helps weed out the spammers and scammers. Otherwise, the app is actually pretty simple comparatively. The interface can be a little cluttered, but it works. It's a good option for those looking for something simple. They also have plenty of users so there's a good chance your stuff will be seen. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Postings Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Postings is the current reigning champ for an unofficial Craigslist app. This one focuses solely on posting your goods to Craigslist and viewing other stuff that's up for sale. The app was made by a fan of Craigslist and has some of the better features for one. The design is fantastic and ads can be displayed a variety of ways. Otherwise, this is a simple app for Craigslist. In some cases, it may be better to use the mobile site (or desktop site). Still, it's worth a shot! DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY VarageSale Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY VarageSale is an app that focuses on a lack of anonymity. Users are required to sign up via Facebook so that everyone can see everyone. The idea is to help lower the qualms that people have about buying and selling online. In addition to that, VarageSale covers the basics pretty well. You can list your stuff, arrange sales through the app, and browser stuff from other people. Admins also regulate the service. That should help lower the number of spammers. It's a fairly decent site overall and one of the better apps to sell stuff. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Thank you for checking us out!
