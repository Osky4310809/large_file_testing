(PTI Photo) \nBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said that opposition parties were wrong in criticising demonetisation in the run-up to the Assembly elections in five states of the India. While congratulating the BJP for historic victories in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, Kumar said that people from the backward classes have supported the BJP in the UP. \n“As far as the result of Uttar Pradesh election is concerned, people from backward classes have supported BJP. Along with this, no attempt was made by other parties to unite the backward classes,” Kumar said. \nTalking about demonetisation, Kumar said that opposition parties shouldn’t have opposed the decision so much. “There was no need to oppose demonetisation so much as it generated a sense of satisfaction among the poor. They believed that the decision hurt the rich. But may parties ignored this aspect,” the Bihar Cm said in a release. \nDuring the campaign, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi , Samajwadi party President Akhilesh Yadav , BSP supremo Mayawati had repeatedly attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the demonetisation decision. PM Modi had made old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes illegal in a surprise announcement on November 8, 2016. \nThe allegations of opposition leaders against Modi could not convince voters. This is reflected in the results of the polls. The BJP and its allies managed to win 325 out of 403 seats in UP assembly. The opposition parties were reduced to irrelevance. पांच राज्यों में हुए चुनाव में विजयी पार्टियों को बधाई http://t.co/QfCmBs95Sr \n— Nitish Kumar (@NitishKumar) March 11, 2017 \nKumar also congratulated Congress for victory in Punjab and said that its performance in Goa and Manipur deserve appreciation. \nApart from Uttar Pradesh, BJP also won 57 out of 70 seats in Uttarakhand. Interestingly, the saffron party’s vote share was highest in four out of five states that went to polls. In Punjab also, the SAD-BJP combine received around 31% vote share and finished second after the Congress. Aam Aadmi Party , who pitted iself as a clear winner in the state, could win only 23% seats and 20 seats. \nIn UP, the BJP has not yet made its CM chice clear. Several names are doing the rounds, but clarity of the issue may come after Holi.
