The sparks turn into forest fires as we enter the throes of passion, and the magnetic attraction, newness, and excitement takes over our mind, body and soul. Much as we feel it will “last forever” and “this is it”, eventually, as is obvious in every relationship around us, it fades and we are left the issues of compatibility on other levels. Romantics say, “in matters of the heart you must not listen to your head”, and realists say “use your mind when it comes to your heart”. I believe, that if we truly are in touch with ourselves we know instinctively whether it has the potential to go the distance or not. Of course, we can allow passion or emotion to delude us, but if you focus, you know deep inside it’s just something you are “hoping for”, or “convincing yourself about”, probably because you’re just filling a void. It’s also possible that you’re not ready for a commitment and just want to have something fun, loving and comfortable to add to your life for a certain period of time.\n(Representative Image)\nCommitments are scary for most people and easiest made in the “heady headspace” time of a relationship. No two humans integrate their lives seamlessly, and effort has to be made to made to trim rough edges, iron out creases and darn a couple of holes. You have to always see the bigger picture. If your partner is looking for a commitment and you are not ready because you are not certain they are the right one for you, ask for a specific period of time to make that mammoth decision. To leave them hanging indefinitely isn’t healthy for them or the relationship on which it takes its toll eventually. However, if you’re not ready for a commitment, be it with them or anyone else, let it be known so that the person, in all fairness, can decide whether to live in limbo and uncertainty, or whether they would like to look for someone who thinks they “couldn’t have found someone better to spend the rest of their lives with” and wants to give them the stability and commitment they deeply want and deserve.\nQ&A\nQ) I am a 42-year-old man and have been dating a this woman for the last few years. However, off late she says that her parents want her to get married and settle down. I am not sure if I would like to do that and have also told her the same. But, she says that she would not want to be in a non-committal relationship. What should I do?\nCommitment could mean two things, “I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life waking up with you” or “I love you so much that I’m gonna get the government involved so you can’t leave”. So, it depends what your headspace is regarding commitment. If any part of you feels there is a better woman out there for you, stop wasting her time, however, if you feel she’s the one, put a ring on it. A few years is long enough to know whether what you share is “worth it”.\nQ) I was briefly engaged to this girl from Hyderabad who now wants to get back to talking and would like to take things ahead. But, I am now involved with my sister’s friend and we are quite serious about each other. My parents however, want me to start talking to the other girl. I am confused and don’t wish to end up hurting anybody. What do I do?\nWell, you can’t hurt someone who only wants to start talking, but you can definitely hurt someone you are serious about by ditching her. The fact that another girl is even an option is surprising. You need to tell your parents you’d like them to get to know the girl you love. It’s you that has to marry and stay married long after your parents are dead and gone, so make sure you marry someone you like and love.\nQ) I am a 28-year-old guy and like my mother’s friend. She seems to be interested in me too. She is unmarried. However, my mother has an inkling of it and has on occasions scolded me too and says that she will cut off relations with me if I pursue this relationship. But, I really like this woman. What do I do?\nErrrr….. I can imagine a mother finding that very disturbing, and you really need to figure out whether your options in life are that limited. When you say the lady “seems interested” that’s really saying that you haven’t entered into a relationship yet. So I suggest you back off and not create chaos in her life, your own family life and walk down a path you’d perhaps rather not have taken.
