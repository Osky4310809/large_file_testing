By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 22, 2017 1:06 PM Indian Skipper Virat Kohli. (ANI) \nJust ahead of the crucial India vs Australia first Test (it is a four-Test series) to be played from tomorrow in Pune, an aggressive Team India captain Virat Kohli said he is extremely confident going into the new series against one of the best sides in the world and exuded confidence about getting a great result for the cricket crazy fans in India. He has a reason to be so confident. After all Kohli is coming off a hot streak against a number of top opposition teams – India is on an unbeaten 19-match unbeaten streak! India beat New Zealand 3-0, England 4-0 and Bangladesh 1-0 in Test series held in 2016-17. Even though they were home series, the fact that these were such emphatic triumphs, puts India’s morale on a very high plane and that will translate into a very aggressive and confident display against the Aussies. \nYou may also want to watch- \nVirat Kohli, who never minces his words whether it is during his times of triumphs or tribulations, indicated exactly how he sees the series panning out by succinctly saying, “We are in good space, not bothered about the opposition.” Kohli is also one who does not let jibes and taunts go unanswered. He took on the carpets today with his in-your-face attitude and snapped, “People wanted me to be 35-year-old mature guy when I was 22. I’ve gone through my gradual process.” As far as his own form was concerned, Kohli said there was no concern at all about his batting. he said, “I am confident about where my game stands.” However, he did not make any comment about how he views his performance about his captaincy. He also did not reveal exactly what he had in mind about Team India’s strategy against the Australians. On top of his mind, of course, would be the spectacular form of opening batsman David Warner and also of Steve Smith, who has always done well in India.
