Jakes scored a major win this year as PepsiCo was announced Friday as the first title sponsor of MegaFest. \nThe international festival of faith, film and family will add finance to this year's gathering with sessions on entrepreneurship and a contest to get more students interested in business ownership. T.D. Jakes to host MegaFest, pastoral conference in Dallas next year \nThe June 28 to July 1 event, put on by Jakes and his Potter's House megachurch in Dallas, is returning to downtown Dallas for the third time, fulfilling a goal announced by Dallas officials when the first North Texas MegaFest was announced in 2012. \nThis year's event, at Dallas' convention center and the city-owned Omni Dallas Hotel, is expected to draw an estimated 100,000 visitors. \nThe 2015 event drew 91,000 visitors and saw direct spending of $32.5 million. \nPepsiCo, the nation's second-largest soft drink maker, is the parent of Plano-based Frito-Lay. \nVivek Sankaran, president of the nation's largest snack maker, said MegaFest sponsorship fits in with the company's focus on inclusion and diversity. \nPhillip Jones, chief executive of Visit Dallas, formerly the convention and visitors bureau, said the sponsorship comes with pouring rights at the event and substantial signage. \nJakes, in an interview following the kick-off news conference, said he hopes other North Texas corporation will follow PepsiCo's lead. \n\"It really is very, very important to the welfare of an event like this that we have corporate sponsorship. and also corporate partnership,\" said Jakes, who also is an entrepreneur. \"It is not just about dollars alone but it is also an opportunity to continue to fuel and fund the entertainment and the empowerment sessions. \n\"We are trying to make MegaFest holistic in terms of dealing with the total needs of the family. And where we have common objectives we can unite around those objectives.\" \nHe also noted that his organization includes an economic development corporation \"so it's not just a faith-based institution.\" \nIn the past, some companies had been reluctant to sign onto an event that is at least in part religious. \nJakes noted that the black church is central to reaching the black community. \nEvent organizers said more details on speakers will be released in the future. Past local events included a taping of the Oprah Winfrey show and also plays by Tyler Perry. \nTwitter: @krobijake", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:07:48.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
