Brooke Wehr continued to slam the ‘Teen Mom’ dad on Instagram after she accused him of sleeping with other women. \n“ If life can remove someone you never dreamed of losing, it can replace them with someone you never dreamt of having,” Wehr posted on Instagram. \nShe captioned the meme, “I guess this is a plus side #motivation #positive #dreaming.” \nAs Radar readers know, Wehr broke the news with a meme of a man dancing with a woman that read, “Yes my love, I love you. I swear I won’t cheat on you tonight .” \nPHOTOS: Is She OK? Rehab Alum Selena Gomez Caught Drinking Amid Weeknd Romance \nShe captioned the photo, “Sounds about right. Too bad he f****d the producer @mandi06.” She added that he slept with two other women and “only about 1,000 other people.” \nShe posted another meme that read , “I don’t always fall in love. But when I do it’s with a cheating sociopath that fucks up my life and wastes my time because I’m obviously retarded.” \nChelsea Houska ’s producer Mandi Venturino , who has worked as a segment producer for Calvert’s ex-wife Leah Messer in the past, told Radar “no comment” when asked about the cheating accusations. \nBut Calvert isn’t letting the split stop him from moving on, as she was at a bar with friends only a day later. \nDespite fans hoping he would reunite with his ex-wife, Calvert denied the rumors on Instagram live . \n“I’m never getting back with Leah,” he said. “We are strictly friends now.” \nDo you think Calvert cheated?
