(Nintendo) \nTrying to catch specific Pokemon in Pokemon Go can be a difficult task, as there’s no real way of pinpointing where certain species will always be. You can generally find types in relevant locations, i.e. water Pokemon near water, but there’s another method you can rely on: keep track of your area’s nests. \nNests are places on the map where a massive amount of the same Pokemon will spawn on a consistent basis. While you could head to water in hopes of finding a Squirtle, going to a confirmed Squirtle nest will mean you have essentially a 100 percent chance of walking away with one. Usually, the super uncommon Pokemon won’t be found in nests, but there are actually a few rare Pokemon nests that have popped up around the world. If you live near one, you basically hit the jackpot. \nThere are a few helpful resources to make use of if you’re hoping to find some of these nests. First, however, an important note: Niantic Labs recently began changing nest spawns so that they output different species than when the game originally launched. Some players were disappointed to find that major Dratini nests, for example, suddenly became Eevee spawns instead. Certain nests that were home to rare Pokemon also appear to have been removed entirely, as Niantic felt it was too easy to catch these high-leveled species. \nThis wiki , however, features a pretty solid list of spawns from around the world, as reported by users who have been there themselves. The list is sorted by species so that you can easily find what you’re looking for, though you can also click on “town/city” to sort by what’s near you specifically. The most recent nest update came on August 22nd, so be sure to check the “confirmed date” section of the chart. If information about the nest hasn’t been verified since before the 22nd, it may no longer be home to the same species as it once was. \nFor these nests prior to the 22nd, you can always check yourself to see what they are now outputting. Via The Silph Road , here is a list of some of the August nest migrations, with the left column being the old nest spawn and the right column being the new nest spawn. Information about the nest migrations is still being collected.
