Just take a look around. It's undeniable. —Noctis \nThough his three companions are not royalty, Noctis usually acts as an equal to them. His royal upbringing shines through however, as reflected in his body language, poise, and posture in contrast to his team. According to Director Hajime Tabata one of his defining aspects is his \"sense of ennui\". He regularly dozes off; this is present from his early childhood. He loves animals, but hates bugs. Hajime Tabata has described Noctis's relationship with his father thusly: Noctis has grown up seeing his father as both a father figure and as the king of the country, so during the game he tries to grow as a person and develop with that image in mind with his father as a role model. —Hajime Tabata [4] According to Final Fantasy XV Prologue Parting Ways , Noctis's personality changed following a childhood incident, making him more withdrawn despite having been a lively child before. \nNoctis has been described as a complex character who has dealt with a lot of emotional turmoil as his mother died when he was young and his father had to cater to the demands of the kingdom, leaving Noctis feeling alone. Nevertheless, he is not bitter over it, accepting that sacrifices had to be made. Noctis is still trying to figure out who he is, and struggles articulating his feelings. He keeps a lot bottled up, especially with confronting how he feels about his childhood friend Luna . Regis has noted that Noctis was difficult to control and quite rebellious. Abilities Edit \nAs the heir to the throne of Lucis, Noctis can wield the power of kings, and those he associates with share into some of his power. Weapons manifest to his use from thin air, and only he can wield the crystalline Royal Arms of his forebears; the power to wield all of these weapons at once is called Armiger , during which he is empowered by the souls of his ancestors. He can warp short distances, and phase through solid matter. These powers of teleportation can be used for combat. He can collect elemental power from the environment and craft spells that those with him can also gain access to, but his true magical power is only harnessed via the mythical Ring of the Lucii that lets the equipper wield the power of the Crystal itself in exchange for the user's own life force. The kings of Lucis have forged covenants with the astral gods of Eos , and once Noctis does so he becomes able to call forth the astrals to aid him. Story Spoiler warning : Plot and/or ending details follow. ( Skip section ) Young Noctis injured. \nNoctis is the son of King Regis, the Crown Prince of Lucis and thus heir to the Caelum line. His mother, Queen Aulea, died when he was an infant. In his childhood, Noctis was the victim of the daemon Marilith ; the servants who accompanied him perished while Noctis was gravely injured, but he was saved by Regis and his attendees. \nAs depicted in Platinum Demo – Final Fantasy XV , Noctis went into a coma and retreated into a dream world . He came under the protection of Carbuncle , a magical creature who helped him fend off attacks from an unknown force attempting to keep him from waking up. Afterward Noctis spent time in the country of Tenebrae recovering, where he befriended the young Princess Lunafreya: while their time together was short, they bonded and forged secret promises. Luna showed Noctis a red notebook they can use to secretly keep in contact, using her dog Umbra as a messenger. \nNoctis learned about the Crystal of Lucis and how his father is its sworn protector from Luna. She told Noctis he is the Crystal's chosen to banish the plague of darkness from the world, and Noctis promised to do it, although he didn't understand what was asked of him. Noctis also met Gentiana , the mysterious Messenger of the gods who stays by Luna's side. Gentiana was pleased the future king of Lucis would have such a close relation to the Oracle . Regis takes Noctis away when Tenebrae is attacked. \nWhen the Niflheim Empire invaded Tenebrae Regis barely escaped with the young Noctis. Though he tried to also take Luna, she opted to stay behind as she couldn't abandon her brother, Ravus . From that time on Noctis and Luna could no longer see each other, although they kept in secret correspondence. \nWhen Regis returned to Lucis with Noctis, he discovered that both Noctis and Lunafreya have been \"chosen by the stars\" for a greater purpose, laying a further burden upon the young boy. [5] [6] \nWhen a king of Lucis dies, their wisdom is passed to the next generation via the bonding of souls, and thus the royal line lives on. The family heirloom, the Ring of the Lucii, contains the accumulated powers of the previous kings of Lucis and is inherited by the person next in line for the throne. However, using the ring's powers saps the user of their life force. The summoned swords both Noctis and Regis can wield are also inherited from each previous king. Regis was doomed to age prematurely due to his life energy being needed to power the Wall around Insomnia , the Crown City. Regis is conflicted about whether to put such a burden on Noctis. Noctis in school. \nAs depicted in Brotherhood Final Fantasy XV , despite being royalty, Noctis attended a regular school. He befriended a boy named Prompto , whom Luna had advised to seek Noctis's friendship as he hadn't mingled much with others. Noctis graduated top of his class. Gladiolus was his tutor for battle skills since early age, although the two did not initially get along, Gladiolus viewing him spoiled. The two befriended after Noctis saved Gladiolus's younger sister Iris from getting lost and took the blame for wandering outside the palace grounds even if he had only been following Iris to make sure she didn't get hurt. When Noctis was a teenager, Regis asked Ignis to look after him. Noctis moved to live alone to gain more independence, and although he did well in his exams, he struggled with the pressures of being the future king of Lucis, and the prospect of his father dying. \nAt age 20, Noctis, as the heir to the Lucian throne, sets forth from his homeland to formalize the union of states through his marriage to Lady Lunafreya of the imperial province of Tenebrae. Accompanying Noctis are his friends—Ignis, his royal advisor; Gladiolus, his bodyguard; and Prompto, his friend from high school. As depicted in Final Fantasy XV Prologue Parting Ways , Noctis tried to meet Regis the day before they left, but he was too busy with the treaty-signing preparations. Lucis was to relinquish all territories outside Insomnia to the Empire in exchange for peace. Regis knew it to be a trap, and didn't tell Noctis of the true reason he is being sent away from the city with his friends, hoping Noctis would one day understand his reasons. Noctis's party at Hammerhead. \nThe four head toward Altissia to meet with Luna for Noctis to marry her to solidify relations between their countries as a political union despite their childhood friendship and Noctis's complicated feelings for her. Regis sees them off with a heavy heart at the steps of the Citadel. On their way across Leide , Regalia , Regis's car the party is using, breaks down. The party pushes it to the nearest service station, Hammerhead , where they meet the mechanic Cindy and her grandfather Cid , Regis's old comrade. \nCid recognizes Noctis due to his resemblance to Regis, and assures them the car can be fixed, but it will take time, leaving the party stranded for the time being. Though knowing Noctis is the prince Cid doesn't act respectfully, implying he doesn't think Noctis is ready to become the king. Cindy handles the repairs, and the party is left to make the money to pay her. Once the repairs are done, the party heads to the port town of Galdin Quay , where they hope to take a ferry to Altissia. However, the ferry is not running. Noctis speaks to Cor outside Insomnia. \nThe party learns that Niflheim has attacked the Crown City and Noctis and his father are reported dead alongside Lunafreya. They turn back, but a blockade prevents them from reaching the city. They find a high vantage point to see it from a distance, and receive a call from the marshal of the Crownsguard , Cor Leonis , as to the state of affairs. Noctis learns that the news of the king being dead are true, and Cor helps him get started on his quest of retrieving the legendary weapons of Lucis's past rulers. After opening the road to Duscae , Cor deems Noctis strong enough to continue on his mission without his help, and departs. \nIris calls Noctis to tell him she's made it to the town of Lestallum , and they decide to go see her. On the way there, they have an option of visiting the meteorite crystal said to have fallen to Eos eons ago, but if they try they are repelled by Niflheim forces. In Lestallum, Iris shows Noctis around the town and he learns Luna made it out of Insomnia. With little recourse, and Noctis' duty to his country, the party resumes their trip to Altissia in hopes that Luna headed there, however, the ship to there is still out of commission. Noctis before Titan. \nNoctis is tipped off on a Royal Tomb being hidden in the area behind a waterfall , and his party heads to retrieve it. Noctis begins to experience sudden headaches and bizarre visions as the Archaean Titan is calling for him. The Disc of Cauthess area where Titan resides, said to be holding the meteorite, is locked down by the empire, but Chancellor Ardyn Izunia opens the way for them. Noctis comes before the astral as Niflheim forces storm in and try to destroy the god. Noctis has a vision of Luna communing with Titan, and forms a covenant with him, gaining the ability to summon him. Surrounded by imperial forces, Ardyn helps Noctis's party escape the site. \nLuna is seeking to rouse gods of Eos, known as the Six. Noctis receives a message from her via Umbra, in which she lends her support to his cause. Duscae is shrouded in a storm until Noctis passes Ramuh's trial and gains the means to summon him. Noctis is guided by Gentiana who communicates with him telepathically, directing him what he needs to do to gain the gods' favor. Ravus confronts Noctis's party. \nUpon acquiring the astral's power, Noctis enters the nearby Imperial Base to recover the missing Regalia. After fighting through the magitek armors and soldiers at the base, he is confronted by Ravus Nox Fleuret before he can reach the car. Ravus berates them and is about to battle them, but Ardyn intervenes, instructing Ravus to go to Altissia. With the Regalia recovered, the party returns to Lestallum. \nWhen they meet Iris back at the hotel, she reveals that the empire's general Caligo attacked Lestallum while the party was away. The Amicitia family butler, Jared Hester , was killed defending Iris. His grandson Talcott is traumatized by this event, and Noctis expresses his sorrow for his loss. During the night, Noctis dreams of following Luna's dog Pryna while encountering various terrors. \nNoctis and the party escort Iris to Cape Caem , but on their way, they discover the Empire has set up yet another \"flying fortress\" near Old Lestallum . With Ignis's help, Noctis incapacitates General Caligo, but he escapes before they can exact revenge for the killing of Jared. As he leaves the base, Noctis is ambushed by Commodore Aranea Highwind , whom Caligo spoke of in distrust. After a brief fight she leaves. Noctis continues to Cape Caem, where the Hammerhead crew is busy working on Regis's old ship, which will grant them passage to Altissia. They stay at Iris and Talcott's new house by the sea, where Talcott reveals that there is still mythril ore that can be used to repair the ship at Vesperpool . The party and Iris at Caem. \nGladiolus goes off on his own to contemplate the recent events. Noctis, Ignis, and Prompto slip into the Empire-held area and with Ardyn's help, although they cannot fathom why an imperial official is helping them. They venture to find the ore under the supervision of Aranea, who recognizes Noctis as the prince. She guides them through a temple, and ruins submerged in water, an anomaly created by the abundant daemonic energy. Through her, Noctis learns that the bulk of the Empire's military force is powered by daemons , creatures that lurk in the depths of caves and emerge during the darkest hours of the day. Aranea is concerned over the direction the regime is taking. After securing the mythril, Aranea wishes Noctis well, advising him to choose his own path in life. \nNoctis and his friends make their way to Altissia on King Regis' boat. During the trip they discuss the news of Ravus being the high commander of the imperial army, and that he holds King Regis's sword , although he cannot wield it as he is not of the Lucian line. Noctis feels ambivalent, but believes he'll be able to reclaim the sword from Ravus. \nWhile in Altissia, Luna gives a speech to the masses about her desire to wake Leviathan and to help banish the growing darkness. The world is plagued by a phenomenon known as the Starscourge that has the nights lengthen, but the line of the Oracles of which Luna is the latest has the power to fight this darkness. Noctis undertakes Leviathan's trial, who goes berserk despite Luna's efforts to calm her. Luna calls upon the deceased kings of Lucis to aid Noctis. Noctis battles Leviathan with the power of kings through the bonding of the souls until Titan interferes and Leviathan is calmed. Amid Noctis's battle, Ardyn stabs Luna but Noctis is powerless to help her. Noctis reaches out to Luna's spirit. \nAfter the battle a weakened Noctis is left lying on a piece of broken pier. A mortally wounded Luna crawls to Noctis and heals him. The two converse in a dreamlike realm, the prince sad he could not save her. Luna passes the Ring of the Lucii to him before her spirit departs, and Noctis awakens to learn of her passing from a now blind Ignis. Noctis and his team carry on to Gralea , capitol of Niflheim, to regain the Crystal the Empire has stolen. They travel through the continent on train , and though now in possession of the ring of his ancestors, Noctis refuses to wield its power. This angers Gladiolus, who sees Noctis's struggle to deal with his grief as a sign he is not ready for the task upon them. After retrieving another of the Royal Arms, Ignis speaks up to heal the rift that has formed between the companions, and Noctis remains determined to push on. \nTheir train is attacked by the Imperial forces, and when Noctis fights them off he is tricked by Ardyn to push Prompto off the train. They are unable to go back to him and assume Prompto has been captured by the Empire. They stop at Tenebrae and find the Fleuret manor aflame as revenge by the Empire; Ravus has been executed for high treason for the Leviathan incident, and thus the bloodline of the Oracles has ended. Without Luna holding back the darkness, sunlight has almost vanished from the world with daemons now spawning even during the daylight hours. As they speculate that the Crystal has the power to repel the daemons, Noctis is even more desperate to seek it out. Aranea has quit the imperial army and is now helping the victims of the Empire's attacks with Biggs and Wedge . As the passage to Imperial territory is dangerous, Noctis, Gladiolus and Ignis head to Gralea without the other passengers with Biggs and Wedge operating the train. While in Tenebrae, Noctis learns Ravus had always been on Luna's side even though he had been affiliated with the Empire, and that Luna had been looking forward to their marriage. Noctis forges a covenant with Shiva. \nAs they come into the territories outside the imperial capital, they find it unusually covered in a blizzard. As daemons spawn to halt the train at Shiva's corpse, Noctis meets Ardyn again. Noctis demands to know what Ardyn's gambit is, but the latter is frozen by Gentiana who reveals her true identity as the astral goddess Shiva. Noctis forges a covenant with her, and learns Ardyn is immortal and all their attacks on him are ineffective. Pondering what Ardyn's true nature is, the party continues onward to Gralea with the knowledge that Prompto is held captive there along with the Crystal. \nNoctis, Ignis and Gladiolus enter Gralea by train but fall under attack and have to abandon the train with the belief that Biggs and Wedge can look after themselves. Noctis drives the Regalia into the city but the car is destroyed and he becomes separated from his friends. He continues alone but finds he cannot summon his weapons to his side as his powers can been sealed. With Ardyn's taunting voice in his ears, Noctis decides to wield the Ring and blasts the daemons and magitek troops that spawn around him with magic. The imperial city is devoid of human life and swarming with daemons. The magitek troops at the lab the Crystal is said to be kept in have gone rogue. Ardyn's disembodied voice keeps taunting him as Noctis discovers the Empire has been manufacturing daemons, that magitek troops are made out of their experiments with daemons and clones at the lab, and that a \"vanishing disease\" has ravaged the Empire that has its citizens turn into daemons the Empire cannot control. Noctis finds Ravus dead and recovers his father's sword. Noctis and the Crystal. \nHe is reunited with Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto who had been brought to the lab by Ardyn. After discovering Prompto was born at the lab to be made an MT, they can use him to open the sealed areas and find Emperor Iedolas Aldercapt 's throne room. The Emperor's robes are left on the seat as he has also vanished and become a daemon. After turning off the device that seals his powers, Noctis and his friends are ambushed by a horde of daemons and his friends urge him to go to the Crystal alone to use it to banish the daemons. \nNoctis reluctantly leaves his friends behind and makes it to the Crystal but is absorbed inside it while being taunted by Ardyn. Ardyn reveals his true name as Ardyn Lucis Caelum, Noctis's ancestor who was tasked with healing the world from daemons. He had become corrupted by daemons during this and was rejected by the Crystal for his affinity with the darkness. The Crystal holds inside it the planet's soul and in this otherworldly dimension Noctis meets Bahamut and is made aware of his destiny as the True King . The True King is born once all of the Crystal's power is passed onto the Ring of the Lucii and can banish the darkness from the world at the cost of his own life. Noctis awakens from his 10 year slumber. \nNoctis spends ten years in the Crystal accumulating its magic and strengthening himself to prepare for both his battle against Ardyn and his sacrifice. When he returns he finds the world roaming with daemons and perpetually dark. He meets with his old companions and, dressed in their formal attire, they set up camp for one final meal together during which Noctis struggles expressing all the emotions he is holding inside. They head to the ruins of Insomnia where Noctis finds Ardyn. Ardyn sends Ifrit , the astral known as \"The Betrayer\" who is the origin of the Starscourge plague. Noctis defeats Ifrit with the other astrals' help, but before heading to the throne room to fight Ardyn he asks to see all the photos Prompto had taken of their journey, choosing one to take with him. \nNoctis finds Ardyn sitting on the throne below the Crystal and challenges him. Noctis kills Ardyn, who promises to wait \"on the other side\". Noctis asks his friends to walk tall in a manner King Regis sent them on their journey ten years ago. Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto stay outside to fend off the daemons as Noctis ascends the throne. He calls the spirits of the Kings of Lucis that attack him one by one until Noctis's soul is absorbed by the Ring of Lucii. Noctis's spirit delivers a final blow to Ardyn, forever vanquishing him. The prophecy is fulfilled and light is restored to Eos. Noctis and Luna resting on the Lucian throne. \nNoctis's spirit appears on a throne dedicated to the 114th king of Lucis with Luna in her wedding dress. She rests her head, prepared to sleep.
