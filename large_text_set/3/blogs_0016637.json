Right now, there’s no monitoring. So, this bill sets up the dotted line — the border where this will happen — and the appropriations bill will find the dollars to make it happen.” \nSouth Florida’s reef system has been dying at a rapid pace owing to warming ocean temperatures and ocean waters growing more acidic as they take in more carbon dioxide.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported last year that ocean temperatures have been rising faster in the past 30 years than at any point since the 1880s, when record-keeping began. \nReefs cover less than one percent of the ocean floor, but provide habitat to more than a quarter of ocean fish. The Florida Reef translates to billions of dollars in the local economy from tourism, recreation and fishing. \nA bill identical to the initial version of Jacobs’ billwas filed in the Florida Senate by state Sen. Gary Farmer, D-Fort Lauderdale, but has not yet had a committee hearing. It would have to be changed to match Jacobs’ new bill before it could be passed and move to the governor’s desk for signing. \n, 954-356-4605 or Twitter @Daniel_Sweeney", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:42:23.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
