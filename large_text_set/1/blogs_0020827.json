Fertilizer \n“We expect the first shipment of phosphate from Morocco to arrive by Friday in Lagos and then the blending will be done here. \n“We are bringing the price of fertiliser to N5, 000 per bag. \n“We want to ensure that every blender in the country who has the capacity will blend and even those that their machines are not in order, we are going to support them. \n“If we can bring the prices of fertiliser to N5, 000 per bag, food production will become easier and farmers will enhance their profit. \n“That is why the King of Morocco (Mohammed VI) came to Nigeria and that is why President Muhammadu Buhari also went to Morocco. \n“The target we have is about 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes of fertiliser per annum from Morocco but the problem we have is that we do not only satisfy Nigeria, our neighbours always come in and take a bit. \n“We cannot deny them entirely but we have to satisfy ourselves first,’’ the minister said. \nDangote Group and the OCP Group of Morocco had in December 2016, signed an agreement to import more than two million tonnes of customised fertiliser into Nigeria. \nThe agreement was meant to boost fertiliser production and businesses in the country within the next three years. \nThe OCP Group is a global leader in phosphate and phosphate derivatives market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:31:27.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
