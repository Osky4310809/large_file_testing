The loot: three shirts by Enfants Riches Déprimés valued at $18,138, a pair of Versace shades and a pair of Les Copains glasses that are both valued at $700, according to court docs. \nThe latest word from Migos, according to Clark, is a text from their manager that said “That’s over wit.” \nThe group was also in headlines this week for allegedly getting into a scuffle with Sean Kingston . The singer claimed he was not injured and reports say he will not take the case to the police. Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
