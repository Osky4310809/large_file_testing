Appearing on SiriusXM's Full Ride Wednesday (h/t ESPN.com news services ), Ball reaffirmed his belief that James' children won't grow up to be great basketball players because they will be playing in their father's shadow: \nI gave an opinion on what I felt about no superstars' kids really being superstars and the fact that they have to live up to their parents or to their fathers or whatever. I have yet to see one, and I've been around for 50 years. Have you seen one where the superstar's son is just as good or better than him? I said a superstar. I ain't saying just a regular player. I'm talking about a guy who we picture as an icon — a Dr. J, an Allen Iverson , a LeBron James. If somebody asks me a question, I'm gonna give them an answer. Ball's initial remarks were made during an appearance on In the Zone with Chris Broussard , when he stated LeBron James Jr. and Bryce Maximus James would be hindered by how much they have to live up to. \"You got LeBron—it's going to be hard for his kids because they are going to look at them like, 'You got to be just like your dad,'\" Ball said, per ESPN.com's Dave McMenamin . \"And after a while, that pressure starts sitting on you like, 'Why do I got to be just like him? What can't I just be me?' And then they are going to be like, 'Aw, you're soft. You're not that good.' Because the expectation is very, very high.\" After that statement surfaced, James told McMenamin he'd prefer if Ball abstained from speaking about his sons publicly. \"Keep my kids' name out of your mouth. Keep my family out of your mouth,\" James said Tuesday. This is dad to dad. It's a problem now. \n\"He can talk all about his brand, talk about his sons, talk about basketball, talk about me. But keep my family out of this.\" Ball, however, refused to heed LeBron's advice. \"I don't care what LeBron said,\" Ball told SiriusXM on Wednesday, per ESPN.com news services. \"He talking about he warned me. He warned me for what? What is a warning going to do? Nothing.\" Like the new article format? !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:06:05.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
