Well, Iulia Vantur surely feels that as she walked for the first time at an Indian fashion event tonight and she nailed it. The Romanian beauty presented Splash’s summer collection and we have to say she looked really pretty tonight. Iulia wore a black and golden ensemble with minimal accessories. She looked ravishing as she strutted her stuff. It didn’t look like her debut on Indian runway at all as the lady was damn confident. Everything was very graceful in her stance. If you don’t believe us, check out her rampwalk video right her.

Sooraj went for a full black look with a black tee, pant and jacket. Karishma, on the other hand, wore a shimmery green ensemble. Splash’s latest collection was really cool and boasted of dresses, crop tops, one pieces, jeans, jackets, capes and much more. \nDaisy Shah, Elli Avram, Alvira Agnihotri and various other celebrities attended Splash’s show, however Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif (Splash’s brand ambassadors) were missing. We wonder why the Tiger Zinda Hai actor missed the show. \nOn the professional front, Iulia recently launched her first duet with Himesh Reshammiya – Every Night and Day. She even made her stage debut at a recent awards ceremony. She is currently working on her music and might soon be seen in a film too. Meanwhile, Sooraj is all set to start work on his film with Ajay Devgn. Anyway, till then check out all the pictures and videos from the show right here. \nComing back to Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2017, this season has been a starry affair with Sonakshi Sinha, Varun Dhawan, Kiara Advani, Priety Zinta, Vaani Kapoor, Diana Penty, Swara Bhaskar and a few others walking do star designers till now. We expect to see Bipasha Basu, Karisma Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan turn muse for top designers too.
