File photo \n  The Sandiganbayan will proceed with the trial of a graft case against former Metro Rail Transit (MRT) general manager Al Vitangcol in connection with his alleged attempt to extort $30 million from Czech company Inekon Group in 2012. \nIn a five-page resolution dated Feb. 9 and released yesterday, the Sandiganbayan Sixth Division denied Vitangcol’s motion to quash the case. \nThe anti-graft court found no merit on Vitangcol’s arguments that the court has no jurisdiction over the case and that the facts cited in the case information sheet do not constitute a crime. \nIn his motion, Vitangcol said that under Section 2 of Republic Act 10660, a regional trial court shall have the “exclusive original jurisdiction” in cases that do not allege bribery or damage to the government or if the amount of the alleged bribery or damage to the government is below P1 million. \nBut the anti-graft court said the law cited by Vitangcol does not apply to his case since the charged offense was allegedly committed in July 2012 or almost three years prior to the implementation of RA 10660 in May 2015. \nVitangcol and his co-accused Wilson de Vera, a director of maintenance provider PH Trams, are facing two counts each of violation of Section 3 (b) of Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.   \nThe case stemmed from Vitangcol and De Vera’s alleged attempt to extort from Inekon Group some $30 million, later reduced to $2.5 million, in exchange for awarding to Inekon the contract for the supply of train coaches as part of the P3.8-billion MRT expansion project under the previous administration. \nThe alleged extortion try, which happened on July 9 to 10, 2012, was exposed by then Czech Ambassador to the Philippines Josef Rychtar. The extortion attempt supposedly took place in Rychtar’s house in Forbes Park in Makati City. \nVitangcol and De Vera denied the allegations. \nThey said the officials of Inekon entered into a joint venture agreement with De Vera’s group under a 60-40 percentage sharing, with 60 percent in favor of Inekon. \nThe contract for the supply of coaches was eventually awarded to CNR Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Company of China, while the maintenance contract was awarded to PH Trams after officials of Inekon supposedly refused to pay the amount allegedly being extorted by Vitangcol and De Vera. \nIn his motion, Vitangcol claimed that since he was charged with “attempted extortion” and there is no such offense or crime defined under the law, the case must be dismissed. \n“The offense charged against him is for violation of Section 3 (b) of RA 3019 for ‘demanding or requesting or attempting to extort money’,” noted the ruling penned by division chairman Associate Justice Rodolfo Ponferrada. \nAssociate Justices Oscar Herrera Jr. and Karl Miranda concurred with the ruling. \nThe anti-graft court ordered Vitangcol’s arraignment to proceed as scheduled on March 16. De Vera was arraigned earlier and pleaded not guilty.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:14:03.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
