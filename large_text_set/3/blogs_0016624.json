To Disney’s credit, they’re refusing to recut the film for release there, despite a request from censors. \nIt’s faced similar criticism in Russia. Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky told the BBC that the film would receive a screening prior to release to make sure it doesn’t constitute “gay propaganda,” which is evidently still a thing in Russia. Since making his statement, the film did receive approval for showing in Russia, but children 16 and under are prohibited from viewing it. \nThe scene is even getting grief from some critics in the LGBT community. In his weekly column for Out , Michael Musto asked if the scene was actually a step backward, noting that LeFou’s passive, if not closeted feelings toward Gaston, a hunky “hetero stud,” does nothing more than to play up an age old stereotype about gay men that harkens back to the “self-loathing days.” \nTo say the reviews of the scene have been “mixed” is putting it lightly. So, Why Did They Do It? Disney \nCritics and fans alike are questioning Disney’s intentions with the scene. Are they trying to push that gosh darn liberal agenda we all keep hearing so much about from the right? Or, perhaps they’re trying to exploit the circumstances for some added media coverage in the lead up to the film’s release? \nIt didn’t take long at all for reactionaries on both ends of the LGBT divide to form their own hypotheses. That’s exactly why, here and now, I’d like to proffer my own: \nPerhaps the small plot line dedicated to LeFou and Gaston’s potential same-sex romance was put there for no other reason at all than to demonstrate that people who are gay are just as human and common as straight people; that they are no more ordinary or extraordinary than anyone else. Inadvertently however we’ve all proven a point to Condon that even when we say LGBT people are treated with and worthy of the same respect, it’s not actually true. All it’s taken is a passive statement saying there might be a somewhat gay scene in a movie for everyone to start freaking out, as we are apparently likely to do even in this day and age. A Long Time Coming for Disney Disney \nFor such a classically American brand with fans across the political spectrum, the Walt Disney Company is showing its progressiveness when it comes to gay rights and giving the LGBT community a voice on its platform. \nFans praised the company last year when it was discovered that they supposedly featured a lesbian couple in the film Finding Dory . However, critics gave the company flack when they refused to acknowledge the couple. Instead, co-director Andrew Stanton told USA Today in an interview, “They can be whatever you want them to be. There’s no right or wrong answer.” \nDisney gained more credibility with the LGBT community just a couple short weeks ago when, not one but two animated same-sex couples kissed during an episode of one of its animated series, Star vs. The Forces of Evil . \nBut even then, they’re only cartoons. The “gay moment” that took place between Gaston and LeFou is the first time the company has openly broadcast same-sex relationships on such a massive stage. As far as I’m concerned, in 2017, it’s way, way overdue. \nOf course, it’s receiving plenty of love and support from the LGBT community and its allies, too. Condon, himself a gay man, told Variety the scene was “a lovely little sprinkling,” and that he was excited about. “I don’t want to give too much away because I think it’s part of a whole celebration of love, but Disney’s been great about it,” he said. “That’s the thing; the whole ethic of that company is inclusion.” \nJosh Gad told Variety that he was proud to be an integral figure in this historic Disney moment, stating “as subtle as it is, I do think it’s going to be effective and I do think it’s important.” \nSince the reveal, however, Condon has gone on the record saying his statements about the scene have been way, way overblown, and that he hopes audiences don’t make too big a deal of it. You’ll just have to head to the theaters yourself and see it. \nFamiliarize yourself with the subject of James Franco’s new biopic – director Tommy Wiseau and the “greatest bad movie ever made,” The Room .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:31:59.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
