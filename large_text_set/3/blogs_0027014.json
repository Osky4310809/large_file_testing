But pick your office backpack carefully. \nRule 1: No carabiners. You’re traversing Grand Central, not Grand Teton, so keep your pack simple and efficient. Steer clear of bright colors, prints, and patterns. And skip the nylon material or anything that has extra straps or buckles. \nInstead, go with a leather or canvas shell, which provides a more polished yet still no-fuss facade, Boye says. And limit yourself to one or two exterior pockets (no water bottle holders!). \nHerschel Supply’s Heritage backpack is an inexpensive option that fits all these requirements. It’s made of heavy-duty cotton canvas, and the air mesh straps are designed for comfort and ventilation ($55, herschelsupply.com ) . \nLooking for leather? If you can swing the cost, treat yourself to the Tumi Bryant backpack ($595, tumi.com ) . It comes with additional perks, such as free monogramming—not to mention the title of office style setter. \nWhile casual bags like backpacks, totes, and messengers are fine for every day use, Boye advises against bringing them to something where it’s important to make a great first impression, like a job interview or business meeting. \n“Stick with the traditional,” he says. “Attache cases or briefs with handles say ‘I mean business’.” \nAn office appropriate backup: the tote. While it doesn’t offer the same number of interior pockets or the security of an all-around zipper, Boye says that the tote “is a great option for guys who need to cart both work and gym gear to and from home. Choose one in a dark canvas with leather accents.” \n(Now that you've got the bag figured out, how about the rest of your office outfit?
