The £50m proposal includes the construction of a new combined training centre, the redevelopment of the existing facilities at the Academy and designs to convert the main pitch into an indoor pitch. \n\"As part of the proposed masterplan, KMBC is leading on proposals to provide new and improved football pitches and sports facilities to the area, working closely with local football teams, including Kirkby AFC. The much-needed upgrade to the pitches will be able to support the highest level of amateur football matches with new changing facilities and car park.\" \nKnowsley Council's cabinet member for regeneration and economic development, Councillor Graham Morgan, added: \"We have been working closely with Liverpool Football Club and the local community to develop these plans for the site on Simonswood Lane in Kirkby. \n\"As well as developing the LFC Academy site, the plans include proposals to provide new and improved football pitches and sports facilities for local teams and the community.\" \nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp first publicly suggested that Melwood and Kirkby may need to be brought closer together after a preseason friendly at Tranmere Rovers back in July -- on the same day he penned a six-year contract extension at the club . \nLiverpool's Kirkby site was first opened in 1998 and is currently headed by academy director Alex Inglethorpe, who signed a new contract back in November. \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
