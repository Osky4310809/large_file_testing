He continued \"…even those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!\"\nBut Heat Street reports that Tiffany Trump, who is an internet celebrity, model and singer, is registered to vote in both New York and Pennsylvania.\nBeing registered to vote in two different states often happens when someone moves to a new location. If their previous state fails to update its voter rolls in a timely manner, that person will show up as being registered to vote in multiple locations.\nTiffany lived in Philadelphia while attending the University of Pennsylvania, but ultimately cast her vote in New York City, according to The Hill.\nAlthough it is not illegal to be registered in two states at the same time, it is unlawful to cast a ballot in more than one state in the same election.\nFred Voigt, the deputy election commissioner for Philadelphia, told Heat Street, \"There is nothing illegal about that. The illegality only occurs if one votes in two places, not if you’re registered in both.\"\nAdding that it is “very common for college students to be registered both where they live and where they go to school.”\nThe spokeswoman for the New York City Board of Elections also verified that there was nothing unlawful about Tiffany Trump being registered to vote in two states.\nTrump's pick for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is registered to vote in both New York and California. However, records show that he last voted in New York in 2008, reports The Hill.\nChief White House strategist, Steve Bannon, is also registered to vote in two states – New York and Florida.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T04:20:15.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
