The first half we were in the game and looked solid defensively, even though we did not do enough offensively. We got caught on the counter for the first goal,\" he said. \n\"We had a big claim for a penalty. Looking back on it, it is a penalty. \n\"In the second half, we started poorly and then it was an uphill struggle after the first own goal. Arsenal showed how much quality they have offensively. \n\"We could have had a penalty and then two deflections went against us. I did see some good things but you have to do it for 90 minutes at this level. \n\"We have all got a difficult job on our hands and we have to work on the training field to get the basics right. We will have a better chance after that. \n\"We were wasteful with the ball, the team defended well in general, but we did not do enough offensively. \n\"It is not an eye opener, I know what this level is like. We need to put in some decent performances and be ready for the games we need to win.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:49:13.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
