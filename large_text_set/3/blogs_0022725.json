Before the decision was made, some Waitrose shoppers shared their disdain for people coming in for free coffee. Jacques wrote on Twitter: \"Urgh, opening time at Waitrose. Need to fight through the crowds of chavs desperate for a free coffee.\" And one woman wrote: \"Please don't turn into a 'soup kitchen' handing out free drinks. \"The usual clientele of Waitrose are hardly strapped for cash.\" While a person in Hertfordshire, tweeted: \"Bit disconcerting seeing people carrying cups of hot coffee around Waitrose whilst they text and push trolleys with their bellies.\" But, one twitter wrote this morning, that the news will be like an \"earthquake\" for freebie hunters.
