Oh, and did I mention he used a big sign that read “Trump Things” in that creepy, red font? Grab some Eggo waffles, and get ready for one of the best responses to the president’s tumultuous first few weeks in office. Like Mike, Dustin, Lucas and Eleven from Stranger Things, we are now stuck in the Upside Down. pic.twitter.com/bDkwYz3ohm \n— David Cicilline (@RepCicilline) February 16, 2017 \nCicilline said, \nMr. Speaker, like the main characters in ‘Stranger Things,’ we are now stuck in the Upside Down. Right is wrong, up is down, black is white. \nAside from throwing in a Chief Hopper reference that was pure fire, Cicilline went on to highlight the many contradictions of Trump’s words and actions. \nFor instance, while the White House maintained its innocence over any potential connections and communications to Russia, the former acting Secretary of the Justice Department Sally Yates is fired . \nAnd after the Trump administration signed a Muslim ban in what they claim is an attempt to keep us safe, they also had national security conversations out in the open . \nIn the end, Cicilline compared everyone resisting the new administration to the heroes of “Stranger Things.” \nAnd like Mike, Dustin, Lucas and Eleven, we must remained focus on the task at hand and hold this administration accountable so we can escape from our own version of the Upside Down. \nIMHO, concerned Americans are genuinely worried we’re going to end up like Barb by the year 2020. Giphy \nI hope so, Hopper. \nOf course, when asked if he was a fan of the show, Congressman Cicilline responded like anyone with a Netflix account would. @BethElderkin @Stranger_Things of course! Can't wait for season two. \n— David Cicilline (@davidcicilline) February 16, 2017 \nHopefully, Trump’s White House, considering the political chaos it’s brought forth, doesn’t get renewed for a second season if you know what I mean.
