When we look at Disney Channel stars then and now , sometimes the differences are striking. But sometimes, an actor looks just like they did when they were a kid . That’s true for Raviv (Ricky) Ullman, who starred in the Disney Channel series Phil of the Future . On the show, Raviv played Phil, a teen boy from the future who has to learn to figure out life in the present. Raviv was totally adorable on the show, which aired from 2004-2006, and he hasn’t changed much since.\nRaviv Ullman as Phil had that winning smile that suggested he was up to something. Disney \nAnd guess what? Raviv still has the same winning smile over ten years later. Bruce Glikas / Getty It’s amazing how little he’s changed. Even though he’s 31 now, he still has the adorable boyish looks that he did as a teen star.\nBruce Glikas / Getty Maybe he has some time travel secrets to share with us about never aging. Or maybe Raviv DID really travel through time to play his role on Phil of the Future . We may never know the truth. But we’re glad to know that not everything about our favorite Disney stars has changed.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T18:45:39.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
