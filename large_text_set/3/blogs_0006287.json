Based on descriptions of the footage from Los Angeles Times reporter Daniel Miller, the footage seems to have been assembled into a kind of sizzle reel. It begins with a joke involving Rey handing Luke a lightsaber, a fun play on the final scene of Star Wars: The Force Awakens . \nThe actual footage included Luke asking Rey, “Who are you?” Rey’s response is a flourish of lightsaber swings, showing off her skilled handling of the weapon. Other characters shown in the footage include Chewbacca, Leia, and Finn, and there were also several shots of new locations with a variety of landscapes and climates. There was also some footage of a damaged X-Wing flying through a larger ship. \n\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" clip is being screened. But it's a joke, sort of! We just got a few seconds of Rey handing Luke a lightsaber. — Daniel Miller (@DanielNMiller) March 8, 2017 \nWe just saw more \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" footage. In it, Luke asks Rey, \"Who are you?\" Then we see her deftly handle a lightsaber. — Daniel Miller (@DanielNMiller) March 8, 2017 \nAlso making appearances in \"The Last Jedi\" footage: Chewbacca, General Leia Organa and Finn. — Daniel Miller (@DanielNMiller) March 8, 2017 \nOne last thing on the \"Last Jedi\" footage: We saw all sorts of settings -- mountains, oceans, forests, deserts. Look suitably epic, exotic. — Daniel Miller (@DanielNMiller) March 8, 2017 \nMore on \"The Last Jedi\" clip: We saw a shot of an X-wing wobbling mid-air, under attack inside a giant ship. Looked like a wounded bird. — Daniel Miller (@DanielNMiller) March 8, 2017 \nStar Wars: The Last Jedi , from writer/director Rian Johnson, is in post-production now for a December 15, 2017 release. The film follows-up and continues the story of the next generation of the saga as Rey, Poe, Finn, and Kylo Ren find their place in the galaxy and follow the legacy of Luke Skywalker, Leia, and Han Solo. Daisy Ridley returns to star as Rey, with other returning stars John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson, Gwendoline Christie, Peter Mayhew, Andy Serkis, Anthony Daniels, Lupita Nyong'o Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa. Benicio Del Toro and Laura Dern join the cast in as-yet-unrevealed roles. \nMore Star Wars News:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T21:05:24.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
