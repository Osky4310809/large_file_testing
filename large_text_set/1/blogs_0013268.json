Now one of their most beloved baseball players will have to wait another year to see if he’ll make it into baseball’s Hall of Fame. \nThe Baseball Writers’ Association of America elected Jeff Bagwell, Tim Raines and Ivan Rodriguez to baseball’s Hall of Fame on Wednesday, while San Diego Padres closer Trevor Hoffman fell just five votes shy of joining them. The news irked many Padres fans and even local media, as Hoffman’s statistics all but prove he belongs. \nHoffman holds the National League saves record with 601, which is second all-time to Yankees legend Mariano Rivera. Hoffman was also a seven-time MLB All-Star during his career. \nBut Hoffman handled the news like the professional that he is, tweeting out a congratulations to his colleagues that made it. I first want to send a very heartfelt congratulations to Jeff Bagwell, Tim Raines & Ivan Rodriguez. All three men exemplify what it means… \n— Trevor Hoffman (@THoffman51) January 19, 2017 To be a Hall of Famer in our game. For me, falling short of this class is disappointing, but I don't take being on the ballot lightly… \n— Trevor Hoffman (@THoffman51) January 19, 2017 I'm grateful for every vote and I'm truly humbled to have come so close… \n— Trevor Hoffman (@THoffman51) January 19, 2017 I hope to one day soon share a Hall of Fame celebration with my family, friends, teammates and all of San Diego. \n— Trevor Hoffman (@THoffman51) January 19, 2017 \nCheck out some of the reactions from media and fans below. I am so disappointed for Trevor Hoffman. He did it right. He did it for a long time. He did it like no one else ever had. #HofFWorthy \n— Bill Center (@PadresCentral) January 18, 2017 There's no doubt you're a Hall of Famer, @THoffman51 . You are a San Diego legend – and the game's best closer, period. \n— Kevin Faulconer (@Kevin_Faulconer) January 18, 2017 @THoffman51 This one hurts. Absolutely ludicrous that you didn't get in. 1% shy, but 100% HOF'er in my book! #friarfaithful #lovettrevor \n— Mark Grant (@Mudcat55) January 18, 2017 Videos: Chargers leave SD for LA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:28:58.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
