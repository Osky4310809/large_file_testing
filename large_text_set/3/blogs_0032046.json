And the offense — well, the offense looks closer to that of the 2014-15, 2015-16 Warriors than the one they ran with Durant playing 33 minutes per game. \nDo you really want to mess with a thing that’s working really, really well? \nIt should go without saying that question is ridiculous, although apparently it doesn’t. \nOf course the Warriors want one of the greatest players in NBA history back in their lineup. Durant was deadly on both ends of the court for the Warriors, who were 50-9 and on pace to win 69 games before his injury. \nAnd don’t forget, we asked nearly the exact same question before — last summer. \nRemember the hand-wringing about whether Durant would mess up a Warriors team that won 73 games last year? That concern seemed silly a few months into the season after the Warriors won 23 of 25 games, didn’t it? \nAnd as for the defensive intensity, it’s not a zero-sum game, and lest we confuse correlation and causation… \nDurant is an objectively better defender then the players who have replaced him in the Warriors’ starting lineup, Patrick McCaw and Matt Barnes, and the improvement has been more about the Warriors’ three best defenders — Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, and Klay Thompson — bringing their A-game every night. Durant can only augment what those three players are bringing on a nightly basis. \nIf JaVale McGee can play and not mess up the Warriors’ defense, so can Durant. \nOn the other side of the court, Durant doesn’t require the offense to be run through him — it often did at the beginning of the season, just because he’s Kevin Durant and giving him the ball is almost always great offense. (In addition to the Warriors wanting him to feel welcome on the team.) It’s not going to be easy for Durant, Curry, and Thompson to “get theirs” every night, but so long as the ball continues to move at the same rate it is right now, the Warriors’ offense will be deadly. \nThe real question people should be asking is not if the Warriors will be affected in a negative way by Durant’s return, but rather if any other team stands a chance of beating an NBA Finals favorite that clearly has found the best version of itself without its best player.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:59:54.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
