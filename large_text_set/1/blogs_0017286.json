Jan 20, 2017 \nOn January 20, the world watched — either with horror, elation or somewhere in between — as Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of America. Among those present to witness and ensure the peaceful transfer of power were Hillary and Bill Clinton. \nHillary, in keeping with her famed fashion tradition, wore an all-white Ralph Lauren pantsuit with a coat, but many are pointing out the significance of the color. \nWhite has a deep connection with suffragette history, as it was one of the official colors of the movement. The Guardian points to Valerie Steele, director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology [FIT), who acknowledged the significance of Clinton's white pantsuit when she accepted the Democratic nomination for president last year. Clinton also wore white at her last debate against Trump. \n\"This was a way of using clothing to speak through a visual message,\" The Guardian reported Steele saying in July 2016. \"Because it's not something a lot of people know [that suffragettes wore white], but once people are aware of that, it does reinforce the historical importance of Hillary hopefully becoming the first women president.\" I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values. I will never stop believing in our country & its future. #Inauguration — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 20, 2017 \nVanity Fair suspects that Hillary repeating the color at the inauguration may be a symbol for her support of the January 21 Women's March on Washington , or that it \"could also be a color she simply likes.\" \nFor those who are attending the march, and others who generally feel under attack by Trump's harmful rhetoric toward women, Hillary's possible silent show of support may serve as a comfort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:04:53.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
