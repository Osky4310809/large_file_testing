I am serious.” \n“We elected the Republicans who run the House, the Senate, and the White House and the very, very first thing that comes up on the legislative agenda they vote no, they’re split. They can’t do it. They can’t govern. I am really fit to be tied.\" \nHis criticism wasn’t just pointed at Republicans, however. Varney said he was also “disgusted” by the Democrats. \n\"You guys [Democrats] totally screwed up Obamacare. Totally screwed up 15 percent of the American economy. Now all you're doing is just chucking peanuts from the sidebar there, and making fun of the mess you have made,\" he said. \"This is what happens when the government gets involved in healthcare. Get out of it!\" \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan will hold a press conference at 4 p.m. to provide updates on healthcare reform after pulling the bill Friday afternoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:04:33.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
