Which is fairly understandable really when you consider he's won more trophies than Chelsea, Tottenham or Man City have ever won. Look how happy he is! (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nCall it arrogance if you like, but it's that level of success which allows him to decide he's literally the King of Sweden - something that genuinely happened. \nNow the Swede has turned his hand to the world of aftershaves and fragrances - releasing his very own called Zlatan and Supreme, available for both men and women. Is it just us or does it look more like mouthwash? (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nZlatan visited the Cheshire HQ of the company behind it in order to announce the release and, as is the norm with these sorts of things, the man himself talked about the range and his plans for them. And in true Zlatan style, he wasn't shy of being very, very, VERY confident about it. \n\"I want to do something and conquer, just like I do with football. I have been very involved from the start, I'm learning every day. A couple of years ago, this was a whole new world for me, but I met two lovely persons who were very confident, just like me when I'm playing.\" He's looking at it like it's his own child (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nSaying he will conquer? Check. Reminding people of his football ability? Check. Talking about how confident he is in himself? Check. \nYep, sounds like Zlatan to us. \n\"It felt like some kind of perfect match. I only go in to this to make a difference and we were confident we could make our own story. \n\"I would never do something that I don't stand behind, it's not to make money, I will still eat, I will still survive. It's for a real challenge for me. My personality is in every drop.\" \nSo, there we are. Zlatan is ready to conquer the world of aftershaves and fragrances. What next? Zlatan Ibrahimovic Airport? Surely not... Expect Zlatan to be sitting in your stocking come Christmas...
