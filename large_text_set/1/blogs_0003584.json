Dhoni has done very well as a captain as he has won most of the tournament like ODI World Cup, T20 World Cup, Asia Cup. Ha has also reached No. 1 in the Test cricket. His record as captain is wonderful,” he told ANI. The former Indian seamer added that Indian Test captain Virat Kohli is going through a wonderful run as a captain and he should lead the side in all formats. \n35-year-old Dhoni, however, will remain available for selection for the upcoming ODI and T20 series against England and the same has been conveyed to the Senior Selection Committee. Dhoni has achieved unprecedented success as a limited-overs captain, guiding India to glory in the World T20 in 2007, the ICC World Cup in 2011 and the Champions Trophy 2013. Although he relinquished Test captaincy and retired from the longest form of the game in 2014, he continued to lead the side in limited overs. Dhoni, who currently holds the record for most matches as captain of an international side with 331 games across formats, played his last series as captain against New Zealand at home, where he led the Indian side to a 3-2 series win. \nIndia is slated to play three-match ODI series and three-match T20 series, beginning January 15, at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) Stadium.  03  03 AM IST TOPICS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:36:00.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
