File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - The national government’s outstanding debt continued to rise as of end-January due to the increase in domestic debt as well as the impact of the third currency appreciation to external debt. \nData from the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) showed the national government’s outstanding debt as of end-January reached P6.115 trillion, 0.4 percent higher than the previous month’s P6.09 trillion. \nThe bulk, or P3.953 trillion, was owed to domestic creditors while the rest, or P2.162 trillion, were borrowed from external markets. \nDomestic debt during the period was 0.5 percent higher from the end-2016 level of P3.93 trillion as the net issuance of government securities during the month reached P19 billion. The BTr said the stronger peso also reduced the value of onshore dollar bonds by P10 million. \nThe government earlier raised to P180 billion the amount it would borrow domestically in the first quarter of 2017. Auctions for Treasury bonds and bills were also held weekly instead of twice a month. \nExternal debt, likewise, inched up 0.3 percent as compared to the month-ago level of P2.156 trillion.   \nAccording to the BTr, the increment can be attributed to the impact of third currency appreciation against the dollar, which amounted to P14.04 billion. This outpaced the net repayment and the Philippine peso’s appreciation which amounted to P7.46 billion and P52 million, respectively. \nThe NG’s guaranteed obligations rose 1.1 percent to P519.11 billion from P513.67 last month. \nThe BTr said the increase could be accounted mainly by the effect of third currency fluctuations on external guarantees, which amounted to P5.68 billion.
