But Lenny isn't doing this just to be a daredevil: He's doing it to protect his home state's beloved beaches. \nAlong with adventure filmmaker Alison Teal, Lenny is leading the first ever statewide beach clean-up, starting and ending in Oahu with stops in Kauai, the Big Island, Maui, Lanai, and Molokai, from March 25 to March 31. \nMembers of the local communities (and visitors, of course) are encouraged to jump in and clean alongside the duo, as part of an initiative from Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii and The 5 Gyres Institute. The stops will prioritize Hawaii's \"dirtiest beaches\" in an effort to raise awareness about the importance of keeping coastlines clean â€” and stopping plastics from entering the ocean. \nHave plans to be beachside in the Aloha state this month? You can find the list of events on the Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii website .
