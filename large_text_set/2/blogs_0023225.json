(Source: Twitter) \nWith KL Rahul and Kedar Jadhav establishing themselves in the national team in last 12 months, there will be a tough competition for places in the RCB team but Mandeep Singh believes that it is a good thing for the side. The 25-year-old dynamic batsman from Punjab played a brilliant knock of 86 runs and guided his side to a 6-wicket win against Vidarbha in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy on Saturday at Delhi’s Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium. “Last year I had to miss few matches due to injuries and KL Rahul took his opportunities, Sachin Baby also did well. So, I couldn’t get back into the playing XI and Sarfaraz (Khan) had to sit out as well,” he said. \n‘ Ye mereko pange mein daal rahe ho ‘, laughed Mandeep when he was asked to choose between Virat Kohli and AB De Villiers. “They both are really good batsmen, but when you consider the current performance, definitely Virat is a better player,” said India’s former Under-19 vice-captain. \nHe was full of praises for RCB’s new Rs 12-crore signing Tymal Mills and revealed that there was a lot of talks about him in the Indian dressing room during the recently concluded T20I series against England. “Since Mitchell Starc is not there, Tymal Mills will be the most important bowler for us. He was brilliant in the T20 series. We discussed a lot about him before the series and still, it was tough to score runs against him,” he said. \nWatch Mandeep Singh train hard for the upcoming season: \n— Mandeep Singh (@mandeeps12) January 8, 2017 \nMandeep, who was a part of the Indian squad for the series against England and New Zealand but didn’t get a chance to play, said that unfortunately, sometimes the team is so good that you have to sit out. He reckons that IPL becomes particularly important in this case as it provides you with the platform compete with the best players from all across the globe. He added, “If India is the highest level, IPL comes right after, since all the international players take part in it and if you do well, there is a better chance of making it to the Indian team.” \nIn last few years, Mandeep has been tried at different spots but the youngster believes that’s the quality of a good batsman. “I can bat anywhere from opening the innings to middle order as per the team’s requirement. In Australia, Rahul Dravid asked me to open and I did well so now I’m opening for Punjab in the domestic cricket as well. A good player should be able to bat in every condition and at every spot. I am okay with everything,” said a selfless Mandy, who always keeps his side above his individual preference. \nSpeaking about the captaincy of Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni, Mandeep said that both of them let the players express themselves and have gelled up with the youngsters nicely. “Both of them are really cool and let the players express themselves but, ‘Aisa nahi ki 1-2 wicket ho gaye, tab bhi express karne k chakkar mein chhakke marne ja rahe hai,’ as a player you need to read the situation well,” he said.

(Source: Twitter) \nMandeep recently joined the ‘married club’ of Indian cricket and believes that lady luck will play an important part in his career, just like it did for Yuvraj Singh. “ Main aur Yuvi paaji dono hi team mein a gaye hai . It’s just that I haven’t got the chance to play in a big series so hopefully, in the next ODI or T20 series I’ll get a chance and will grab the opportunity,” he concluded.
