Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!\"\nIt is not the first time Trump has made the accusation, as the Daily Mail recalls. While campaigning in September, he claimed that Hillary Clinton \"gave up 20 per cent of America's uranium supply to Russia…. You know what people do with uranium, don’t you? It’s called nuclear. Twenty per cent. They could have never done it without her.\"\nThe reference is to a deal involving the Russian atomic energy agency and several US federal agencies, including the State Department under Clinton.\nThe deal had to be approved by the nine members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, observes CNN. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton had to sign off on the deal, as did the secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security – in addition to the heads of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. It also had to be approved by the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission and also Utah’s nuclear regulator.\nThe deal involved Russia's gradual takeover of a company with significant U.S. uranium assets, noted Politifact at the time Trump first made the accusation. The company, Uranium One, has mines, mills and tracts of land in several US states equal to about 20 percent of US uranium production capacity. However, Russia does not have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States.\nTrump's citation of a \"Russian speech\" refers to a Russian investment bank that was part of the deal, and which paid Bill Clinton for a speech, notes CNN. His mention of \"Podesta Russian Company\" refers to former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta having been a member of the board of a Russian energy company. The remark about \"Hillary Russian reset\" refers to to the Clinton State Department's attempt to \"reset\" its relationship with Russia in an attempt to get the Kremlin on board with the Obama administration's Iran nuclear deal.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T17:53:51.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
