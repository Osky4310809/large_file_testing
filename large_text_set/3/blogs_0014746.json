Martin O’Malley. Because that’s what you do.” \nSo her excuse for interfering in the Democrat primary debates by sending Clinton a question in advance was that she also sent questions to other candidates. Of course, the latter “fact” is just a claim, as she has yet to offer any proof of this. (And then there’s the fact that in October, she was adamantly denying what she’s now confessing.)   \nYou can hear her admission here: \nBut sadly for her reputation (and that of CNN, which suffered a tremendous loss in credibility, despite its decision to fire Brazile after the WikiLeaks emails were published), the former interim DNC head was not yet quite done blurting out outrageous things. \n“The truth is politics is a hard-fought game, and when you’re in the battle of fighting to make sure that you have inclusion, to make sure you have diversity, to make sure you have the kind of not just communication but the kind of conversation with voters, you want to make sure that those questions, those topics, that is out there,” she said.
