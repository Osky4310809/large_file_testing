Activists celebrated the ruling of the court (AP) \nThe girl’s parents originally sought to allow her to use Wonder when she started kindergarten and was suffering from severe mobility problems. Wonder was specially trained to help open doors, pick up items and give Ehlena a measure of independence, the Associated Press said. \nBut her school district, 75 miles southwest of Detroit, initially said Wonder could not accompany her and insisted instead that adult aides could help Ehlena.

School officials had argued that administrative remedies are an easier and less costly way to resolve educational disputes. \nWriting for the court, Justice Elena Kagan said exhausting the administrative process is not always required in such cases. But she said further fact-finding is needed to decide whether the teenager can pursue her case in court.
