On such an important day, did our new president really have to be so vengeful as he unleashed the tone of his administration? \nThrough remarks more suited for a convention stage, Trump’s divisive rhetoric was an inward-looking hat-tip to his most loyal supporters. He offered the men and women of our country as well as the entire onlooking world reason to doubt any middling hope that he will indeed rise above his nativist, frequently ignorant and often lying campaign-trail posturing. \nWholly absent was the mention of morals or values, but I personally found the glaring absence of the word “freedom” most petrifying. Trump used the term only once and as applicable only to Americans as a reason we should unite. \nAfter years of hearing every prospective Republican presidential candidate, Trump included, bloviate their fealty to Ronald Reagan, I can’t help but wonder what the Gipper would think about how this is coming together — or apart. \nIn his own first Inaugural address, Reagan lauded “the will and moral courage of free men and women” as the most important defining characteristic of America’s strength and peace. \nThat’s the message I choose to remember today. \n[time-ad size=”small” align=”center”]\n[time-ad size=”large”]\nThis post was published on Jan. 20 \nJordan is a TIME columnist and an NBC News/MSNBC political analyst.
