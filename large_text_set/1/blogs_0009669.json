We pay you $25 million, we’ll pay Conor $25 million and then we’ll talk about pay-per-view at a certain number. There’s a real offer,” White revealed. \nIt’s a stunning turn of events after White has said for the past year that there was no way a fight between McGregor and Mayweather would ever actually happen. Conor McGregor vs Floyd Mayweather - no longer just a pipedream. Source: Getty Images \nWhite’s comments come just days after Mayweather said that he would absolutely fight McGregor for a guaranteed $100 million while offering the UFC lightweight champion $15 million with a percentage of pay-per-view buys split between the two of them. \nMayweather stated that he was the bigger draw in the fight so he would receive the lion’s share of the profits up front, but White scoffed at that idea after the numbers the retired boxing champion returned for his last bout. \nAfter Mayweather pulled in over 4 million buys for his fight with Manny Pacquiao — the all-time record for pay-per-view buys in history — his final bout against Andre Berto was considered a flop with only 350,000 buys on pay-per-view. Conor McGregor weighing-in for UFC 205. Source: AP \nConversely, White points out how McGregor has been consistently pulling in well over a million pay-per-view buys, including massive numbers for his last two bouts against Nate Diaz and Eddie Alvarez. \n“First of all let’s cut the B.S. right from the get go — (Floyd Mayweather) hasn’t talked to anybody about this fight. You’re talking to somebody about the fight, you’re talking to me. I’m the promoter. Conor McGregor is under contract to me. To say that Conor McGregor hasn’t made $8 million or $10 million in a fight, wrong again. To think that you’re the ‘A’ side — how are you the ‘A’ side?” White said. \n“The last fight, the last major fight you were in, you left such a bad taste in everybody’s mouth that nobody wants to see you again. His last fight did 350,000 pay-per-view buys. Conor did 1.3 (million for UFC 205) and 1.5 (million for UFC 202) pay-per-view buys. So I don’t understand how you think you’re the ‘A’ side and there’s a reason why you want this Conor McGregor fight so bad — because you know that’s your money fight.” Floyd Mayweather Jr. Source: AP \nMayweather stated this week that he would only come out of retirement to fight McGregor and now White is on board to make the bout a reality. \nAs far as expectations on pay-per-view, White could only speculate what he believes a showdown between McGregor and Mayweather could pull but he knows the crossover bout has limitless potential considering the kind of attention this fight would receive. \n“When you look at things like this, you have to take an educated guess at what you think the possible pay-per-view (would be),” White said. “I would be disappointed if a Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather match didn’t do over 2 million, 2.3 to 2.5 million (pay-per-view buys). But then the upside could be who knows — maybe it could do what (the fight) with Manny Pacquiao did.” \nWhite also said that if the UFC promoted a fight between McGregor and Mayweather that he would add another title bout to the show while also stacking the undercard similar to the event the promotion just held in New York at Madison Square Garden. \nThere are still plenty of hurdles to jump before this fight comes together, but it’s clear White is on board to watch McGregor face Mayweather in a boxing match for the ages. \nTop MMA journalist Ariel Helwani said the superfight had moved beyond pipe dream - yet cast some doubt on it coming under the UFC banner. Mayweather-McGregor has gone from pipe dream phase to exploratory phase. MANY, MANY hurdles to overcome, but not just a PR stunt anymore. — Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) January 13, 2017 Again, an unprecedented amount of hurdles. But, everyone involved stands to make a lot of money, hence the exploring. Worth monitoring now. https://t.co/bYXlpZmxhb — Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) January 13, 2017 It's the one fight on earth that wouldn't need a promoter attached. Remember that. Also, they both want/would generate WAY, WAY more. https://t.co/CHaQeIPzzj — Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) January 13, 2017 Floyd alone made over 200mil for Pacquiao. This could be even bigger. https://t.co/CHaQeIPzzj — Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) January 13, 2017 I believe, in a perfect world, all parties want it to happen. The difficult part is making all parties involved happy. Herculean effort. https://t.co/chkCxSXWhL — Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) January 13, 2017 They are so far away from that point. Fun to dream about it but not even close. https://t.co/KEMnXn6HVC — Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) January 13, 2017 Such fascinating times. Far-fetched or not, UFC just publicly attached McGregor to a $25 million purse.
