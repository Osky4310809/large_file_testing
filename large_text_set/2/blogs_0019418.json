Our Cass Anderson is in a league where the winner of the league gets to pick a brutal destination where the loser has to go. One year, they sent the loser to stay an entire night at a haunted clown motel in Nevada. I would have just abandoned the league and made new friends if I was that guy. No fucking way I’m doing that.\nAnyway, temporarily ruining a friend’s life is part of the fun of fantasy football. And this guy, in the video above, learned that lesson the hard way. He is a student at Michigan State and his punishment for finishing last was to recreate the music video for Cassie’s 2006 hit “Me & U.” I’ve got to be honest, he did an alarmingly good job at it.\n[H/T FTW ] \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:51:40.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
