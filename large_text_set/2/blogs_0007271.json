He initially went on loan from Stamford Bridge to Gladbach in 2014, before a series of impressive displays earned him a permanent deal at the Bundesliga club. \nDouglas Costa warned by Bayern \nChelsea have a reported buy-back option if they want to re-sign Hazard, with Leicester and Atletico Madrid also rumoured to be interested in the Belgium international. However, the attacking midfielder insists that he is happy in Germany. \n\"For the moment, I feel good here,\" Hazard told Goal . \"The Bundesliga is a good championship and for now, I want to stay here. In the future maybe I will be in England again. I hope I can end my career in Belgium, but at the moment I don’t think about the end of my career. \n\"I am happy here, my family is happy, we are next to Belgium with our family there and they feel perfect. It is the most important thing, if my family feel good then I feel good. I speak a bit of German and I am getting better every day. \n\"I am just at the beginning. I like German football, but England have a great championship too and a lot players want to play in England. It is also special, but for now I feel good here. A lot of journalists write things.\" \nHazard put in a fine performance against Freiburg on Saturday as his side won 3-0 and he also scored in the midweek DFB Cup fixture against SpVgg Fürth. Gladbach are competing on two fronts as they aim for success in the DFB Cup and Europa League, after being knocked out of the Champions League in the group stage where they were drawn alongside Manchester City and Barcelona. \nHe has previously talked about how his brother inspired him to a successful career, saying that the pair have been used to transfer stories throughout their respective careers. \n\"Sometimes it is wrong, sometimes it is true,\" Hazard said, in response to the recent transfer speculation. \"Sometimes all the people think it is true. Sometimes people think it is a lie but this is the life of a footballer. \n\"It is okay for me because I have been in football since I was 14. I saw with Eden a lot of stories and I know it is not a problem [for me] to have this. A lot of things can happen, maybe I will be here, maybe I won’t and I could be in another club, who knows, but I hope I can continue to improve. \n\"I have improved every year since the beginning of my career. I hope I can [continue] do this also but maybe in five years I will be finished [laughs]! Hopefully not but you never know.\" \nAt the start of the season Gladbach expected to be competing at the top of the Bundesliga, as they did last year, but they currently sit in mid-table with an outside chance of European qualification while surprise packages including RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt challenge for Champions League places. \nLeipzig suffered a setback by losing away to Borussia Dortmund at the weekend but they remain Bayern Munich's main title challengers. Hazard believes that Leipzig's progress gives hope that a Leicester City-style story can happen for teams in Germany that do not traditionally compete for the title. \n\"Leipzig are one of the best at the moment,\" he said. \"Playing a very strong style of football, they have a lot of power but still play attractive football. They are second and I think that they deserve their position as they only came from the second league and did this. \n\"It is a good job and this year, maybe it is Bayern Munich versus Leipzig, but maybe next year it will be Mönchengladbach. We have quality in the team, we have a good team. Sometimes this season we played really well, but didn’t win the game. \n\"So sometimes football is a little bit about the luck and sometimes we haven’t had it this season. This is football and we need to continue to work and it will be okay, I think so anyway. \n\"In the Champions League we showed we are good team, but we lost to very good teams, of course. We proved that we are very good and I think that everyone knows that.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T16:33:42.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
