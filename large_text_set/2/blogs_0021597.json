Tons of celebrities have spoken out, angry with the administration and with President Donald Trump . Jackie Evancho , who performed at his inauguration even tweeted her disappointment, and appeared on Good Morning America today with her sister, who is transgender to talk about it. One person who has been silent is Caitlyn Jenner . \nCandidate Donald Trump never seemed to mind transgender people using whatever bathroom they wanted to use. He famously told Jenner that at Trump Tower she could use whichever one she felt comfortable in. Jenner, a lifelong Republican attended his inauguration , and just prior to that, she tweeted that she was there to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù Republicans on LGBTQ issues. It‚Äôs worth noting that it‚Äôs entirely possible Jenner is planning to say something, or is planning to try to get to the administration in some other way. \nLots of people have taken to social media to express their anger with her: Republicans need help understanding LGBTQ üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà issues and I‚Äôm here to help! \n‚Äî Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) January 18, 2017 Caitlyn Jenner was FURIOUS about this rollback of trans rights, and I‚Äôve listed her statement on the issue below. #ProtectTransKids pic.twitter.com/TYkhGtBzqf \n‚Äî Clint Falin (@ClintFalin) February 23, 2017 Congratulations @Caitlyn_Jenner on your #LGBT ambassadorship to the Trump Administration.
