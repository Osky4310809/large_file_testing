Photograph: Alamy   Patrick Maguire   \nIn her first speech as prime minister last year, Theresa May pledged to govern for those who found themselves “just about managing” to survive financially. With Britain’s overstretched and underfunded social care system at breaking point, she can add the council in Maidenhead, her Berkshire constituency, to that growing list. \nThe Conservative-run royal borough has not raised council tax for almost a decade, but this year residents will have to pay the maximum 3.95% increase allowed without a referendum of the sort planned by neighbouring Surrey county council. This, say town hall bosses in Maidenhead, is enough to ensure it does not have to cut any of its social care services. But even on May’s doorstep in this prosperous corner of Berkshire, the warnings from senior council figures are stark: Surrey is “the canary in the coal mine” and a complete rethink of Britain’s social care model is needed – fast, they say. “So far, we’ve managed,” says Maidenhead councillor David Coppinger, its cabinet member for adult services and health. \nThough he says Maidenhead runs a tight financial ship and has no plans for a referendum (despite his belief that a majority of residents would support a tax increase), Coppinger regularly meets counterparts from Tory councils in the south-east and knows many wish “they could be as brave” as Surrey and go to the public. “We have to have a new model, say in two years’ time. The current model is wrong: it doesn’t take into account the increasing number of older people, nor a problem at the other end where people with several mental and physical disorders now live much longer. That’s fantastic, but they are exceedingly expensive to look after.” Councils may cut social care provision due to underfunding, LGA says Read more \nThe council’s leader, Simon Dudley, agrees. Maidenhead, the local authority with the highest number of retirees per head of population, already spends 40% of its entire budget on social care for just 2,500 residents. An ageing population means that without a new model that percentage will soon be too large to manage under the existing system. \n“The burden is increasing disproportionately over time against a backdrop of more required efficiencies from local authorities. You see that with situations like Surrey: they simply can’t achieve that, and there will be others. I have absolutely no doubts at all. Other local authorities will find themselves in the same situation as Surrey over the coming years.” \nDudley, whose Twitter profile bears a picture of him grinning beside May on Maidenhead’s high street, has been lobbying the PM. “I have described to the prime minister the pressure that local authorities are under due to adult social care funding, and she recognises that. She recognises, and she’s on the record to say, that there needs to be a longer-term solution to this.” \nSo far, however, none has been forthcoming. Councils have seen their funding for adult social care cut by an average of 11% since 2010 and are having to make leaner budgets go even further due to demographic pressures and rising costs, as a result of tighter regulation and increases in the minimum wage, with NHS services taking extra strain in the absence of comprehensive provision. \nThe new social care precept, which allows local authorities to charge an extra 2% in council tax to fund adult services, barely scratches the surface. “The adult social care precept was very welcome, but it was no more than a sticking plaster to address what is a cumulatively developing desperate situation for local authorities,” says Dudley. The Local Government Association, which represents the leaders of 370 authorities in England and Wales, estimates that there will be a £2.6bn funding shortfall by 2020, and fears the situation is so bleak that some councils could soon be challenged in the high court over their failure to provide a statutory minimum standard of care, and that older people could be deprived of help to get out of bed, washed and dress. \nRegional imbalances and disparities substantially complicate the picture. While predominantly Conservative-run authorities such as Royal Windsor and Maidenhead benefit from high tax bases and small populations, and have been able to cushion the blow of government cuts, Labour-run city councils such as Liverpool are in an almost impossible situation. \nIn the past Liverpool relied on its government grant for 80% of funding. But since 2010 the grant has been slashed by 58% and now its finances are so straitened that last week it sold its Grade II* municipal buildings to fund £5m of repairs to roads . Its care services, which support about 21,000 people, are in an even worse position: demand has increased by 15% since 2010 but its budget has been cut, or £100m. So constrained are funds that those in need of care cannot enter the system until someone else leaves. \nTired of cutting services, Liverpool’s adult social care director, Samih Kalakeche, has tendered his resignation – and says, as things stand, councils such as his will probably soon be unable to meet their statutory requirements. “Frankly I can’t see social services surviving after two years. That’s the absolute maximum. If we don’t do something within the next six months, I believe social services will not exist by 2018-19. This isn’t scaremongering, this isn’t me asking you to feel sad for me – whoever is making decisions out there has looked at social care as the Cinderella of the service, which means more and more people are staying at home with high needs because of the removal of the prevention agenda. People are struggling, people are suffering, and we’re really only seeing the tip of the iceberg.” \nWithout a significant rethink of the system from central government, there is little local authorities like Liverpool can do. The city’s elected mayor, Joe Anderson, floated the idea of a referendum on a 10% increase in council tax (with 6% ringfenced for adult social care) in November, but abandoned the idea after a public consultation revealed a majority of residents would not support it. A low council tax base means just 10% of council income is raised locally, meaning poor residents would have been put through unnecessary pain for small gains. Whereas the 15% increase proposed by Surrey will raise £90m, a 10% rise in Liverpool would raise barely a third of that. \nAnderson, a firm believer in regional devolution, wants the power – and cash – to build smaller community facilities for patients who would otherwise be trapped in hospital beds despite being fit for discharge. But with the government preoccupied with other issues, he sees little prospect of being able to deal with pressing issues “of life and death” locally, any time soon and believes it is only a matter of time “before something tragic happens to someone somewhere”. \n“The government are running round like headless chickens responding in a piecemeal way to other issues, they’re caught up in Brexit – there’s no stability,” he says. “Everybody should recognise, no matter what political colour you are, things aren’t sustainable … We have to change the paradigm – but there is no policy that this government is getting right. None whatsoever.” \nPatrick Maguire is winner of the 2016 Anthony Howard Award for Young Journalists. Applications are now open for this year’s award.
