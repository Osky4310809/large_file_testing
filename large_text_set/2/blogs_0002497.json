However, among the people who are against the notion stands late J. Jayalalithaa’s niece Deepa Jayakumar. In her latest interaction with India Today, she said that she is totally against it and neither people of Tamil Nadu are going to accept this. “I would never imagine of something bad as this happen to the people of Tamil Nadu,” she said comparing it to be as similar as a ‘military take-over’ and not a democratic decision at all.
