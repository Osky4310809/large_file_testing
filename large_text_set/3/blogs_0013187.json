Now is not the time,” May said, speaking to ITV. \n“When the SNP government say that it’s the time to start talking about a second independence referendum, I say that just at this point, all our energies should be focused on our negotiations with the European Union and our future relationship,” she added. \n“And to be talking about an independence referendum would, I think, make it more difficult for us to be able to get the right deal for Scotland and the right deal for the UK. \n“And, more than that, I think it would not be fair to the people of Scotland because they’d be asked to take a crucial decision without the necessary information, without knowing what the future partnership will be or what the alternative of an independent Scotland would look like.” Just imagine Brussels had told the UK that they are not allowed to have a referendum. That's the difference between Scotland's 'two Unions.' — Callum McCaig (@callum_mccaig) March 16, 2017 \nMay’s words do not completely rule out allowing a second independence referendum at some point in the future. \nSturgeon responded to May on Twitter, arguing it would be “undemocratic” of May to block the right of Scotland to choose its own future. . @scotgov is not proposing #scotref now...but when the terms of Brexit clear and before it is too late to choose an alternative path. 1/4 https://t.co/ZR6LDtA8v8 — Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) March 16, 2017 One last point - if PM thinks we won't know terms of Brexit by autumn next year, she must think her own timetable will fail. — Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) March 16, 2017 \nRelations between the two leaders were already strained. Sturgeon took a swipe at May earlier in the week, saying she was voted in on a clear manifesto commitment to Scottish independence, while May, who stepped into Downing Street when David Cameron resigned, “is not yet elected by anyone.” \nAnnouncing her intention to trigger the poll on Monday, Sturgeon said the Westminster government had “not moved even [one] inch in pursuit of compromise in agreement” with Holyrood over Brexit. \nAfter the news was announced on Thursday, SNP MP Alex Salmond interrupted a House of Commons debate on energy to say the PM is “dictating the timing” of a new referendum and should address Parliament. \nHe accused her of breathtaking “arrogance” and of treating Scotland like a “county rather than the country” it is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:24:39.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
