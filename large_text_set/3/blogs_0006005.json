In a move unusual for Wikileaks, individuals' names have been redacted and replaced with unique identifiers. \"These redactions include tens of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe, and the United States,\" Wikileaks' spokesperson explained in the release. \"While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks.\"\nThe documents include instructions for using hacking tools, tips on configuration of Microsoft Visual Studio (classified as Secret/NOFORN), and testing notes for various hacking tools. Among the hacking tools listed are those for iOS, a collection of Android 0days, and hacking techniques from various sources, including the UK's GCHQ and the National Security Agency. These tools, Wikileaks claimed, \"permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo, Confide, and Cloackman by hacking the 'smart' phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.\"\nAlso mentioned in the documents are tools for hacking embedded operating systems, including a Python-based tool for sending commands to a remote keyboard emulator pushed to an embedded device. There are also notes on a joint \"workshop\" with the UK's MI5 on a project called \"Weeping Angel\"â€”in which the services were able to turn a Samsung smart television into an eavesdropping device.\nWhen reached for comment, a CIA spokesperson told Ars Technica, \"We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents.\"\nArs will update this story with further analysis and details when they are available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:52:29.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
