The woman, Theresa Bartram, underwent surgery back in 2007 to help manage her stress incontinence, a condition that causes her to urinate on herself, leaving her insecure about having sex. The procedure used a mesh sling called “transvaginal tape” that prevented her bladder from slipping forward and causing urine to leak. Facebook \nHer sex life was getting back to normal until 2009, when her vagina almost chopped off her partner’s wiener during intercourse. \nBartram described the scene in her own words, saying, \nIt was like it had grown teeth. His willy was bright red and spouting blood. There was a big red stain spreading between us on the sheets. After that, he was scared of my lady garden and approached it as if it was a Venus flytrap and he was a bluebottle (fly). \nApparently, the injury was caused by the plastic mesh, which was originally fitted incorrectly and became hard over time, inserted inside Bartram’s vagina. \nThe New York Post reported that the mesh broke through her vaginal wall and created an abscess that had eventually gotten infected. Doctors told her it had to be “ removed urgently .” \n“It felt like razor-sharp teeth, hence why it had ripped a chunk from my boyfriend’s willy,” Bartram elaborated . \nAfter the incident, Bartram was initially concerned that the mesh was responsible for injuring her partner’s penis, but doctors reassured her that everything was fine.

She begin dieting and exercising, only to discover that her health was getting worse . She experienced stomach bloating, severe aching, diarrhea and vomiting. \nShe found herself at the doctor’s office, again, unsure of what was wrong with her. They first diagnosed her with irritable bowel syndrome and depression. They gave her antidepressants and removed her gallbladder. \nShe continued to see dozens of doctors about her health problems and, despite their reassurances, remained concerned that the mesh was the source of her problems.

She said about the incident, \nIt made my vagina deadly and forced me into a life of celibacy. It could have killed me. I’m pleased the mesh is gone but it has left my body and my vagina a total mess. I wear padding all the time and sleep on incontinence sheets. \nSince her horribly traumatic experience, Bartram has become active in a group called Sling the Mesh, which aims to fight against the controversial surgery.
