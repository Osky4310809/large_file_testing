The month of body detoxes, liver cleanses, elimination diets, and a concerted effort to shun booze for 31 days . But while the benefits of avoiding grains are debatable on each side (leaky gut! important nutrients! ), the spiritual benefit of participating in a creative retreat is something that most experts can agree on. Plus, when the creative unleashing takes place in an exotic locale like Tuscany, Swaziland, or Marfa, who wouldn’t want to hop on a plane in the name of self-improvement? Below, five retreats designed to bring out your inner artist happening this year . \nCherry on Top Women’s Empowerment Retreat, Marfa, Texas February 2–5 On the heels of one of the most inspiring and invigorating sets of women’s marches in the history of the world, comes an appropriately timed female empowerment retreat hosted at Hotel Saint George in Marfa, Texas. Bringing together women (and men) from all over the country, the festivities span four days, with activities ranging from active to cerebral—including morning yoga and meditation, daily mingle mixers, and a pop-up creative market—peppered with topical discussions and film screenings. The retreat is held by the Cherry Cult, a nonprofit coalition of females from the creative arts and activism community, who uses its platform to empower and advocate for equal societal standards. In a time when women are faced with injustice and marginalization, the importance of standing together to create a space filled with positivity, unity, and solidarity has never been more appealing. \nLotta Jansdotter: The Art of Batik + Printing Retreat, Swaziland, Africa March 23–April 1 Brooklyn-based Scandinavian artist and designer Lotta Jansdotter began hosting retreats a few years ago as a way to help others learn to slow down and “mind the details” in everyday life. In partnership with ACE Camps Travel Company, this nine-day retreat in the Kingdom of Swaziland in southern Africa explores “textiles using batik techniques, creating fabric designs, and focusing on your own creativity.” Bordering the Mantenga Nature Reserve and tucked behind Sheba’s Mountain in the Ezulwini Valley, attendees will stay at the Mogi Boutique Hotel, boasting “serene mountain and valley views, walking trails, and alfresco breakfasts serenaded by birds.” Chic, modern rooms feature luxurious linens and quality amenities. Jansdotter will teach a two-day workshop about basic surface design. Design inspiration as well as how to create simple and successful patterns and motifs, layouts, repeat patterns, and color schemes are all part of the lesson plan. Visitors will also spend time at Baobab Batik, a social enterprise offering sustainable work opportunities for women in Swaziland that provides a safe space where people can “share stories, laugh together, and care for each other.” The trip also includes visits to other makers and artisans; time at local markets; and superb walking trails, stunning mountain and flatland scenery, and excellent, high-quality handicrafts. Because Swaziland is one of the few remaining Executive Monarchies in Africa, culture and heritage are deeply ingrained in all aspects of Swazi life, ensuring an unforgettable experience for all who visit. Sirenland Writers Conference, Positano, Italy April 2–8 Held annually at the famed Le Sirenuse hotel, a five-star Italian gem perched on the cliffs of Positano, the Sirenland Writers Conference is possibly a hidden secret in the creative world. Participation is limited to 10 students per workshop to ensure individual attention, creating a tight-knit and friendly community of fellow creatives. Nestled in the heart of Amalfi Drive, located where the Sorrentine Peninsula bends toward the south, the conference features intensive, small-group workshops with writers like Dani Shapiro, Richard Russo, and Jim Shepard. In addition, private writing time and seminars about “living the writer’s life” are included in the programming. Evenings are structured around student and instructor readings, visits from guest writers, and meals overlooking the Tirreno Sea. The price is also unbeatable—$4,300 covers the cost of the conference, plus six nights in a luxury room with ocean views, breakfast, sponsored cocktail hours, and three dinners. Spots run out quickly—and it isn’t unusual to apply well in advance. \nAnnette Joseph Style Workshops and Retreats, Tuscany, Italy July 19–24 Beloved by lifestyle, wellness, and all-around life guru Gwyneth Paltrow , and celebrated as an expert on entertaining, cooking, and styling, retreat host Annette Joseph knows a thing or two about creating stunning editorial images. Joseph has been a regular guest on the Today show and Martha Stewart’s radio program, and she recently purchased a medieval fortress along with a vineyard in northern Tuscany—after a three-year search for the perfect space —in order to create a home for her popular photography and styling lessons. Photo styling workshops and cooking classes will be led by guest teacher, renowned chef, and recipe developer Jodi Moreno alongside the Annette Joseph team. Guided excursions to Parma are arranged so guests can meet with artisanal food purveyors, in addition to trips to local farmers’ markets to suss out the best produce for styling sessions and cooking classes, and visits to seaside villages and antique markets. Essentially, this is the fantasy study-abroad experience everyone wishes for. \nArt for Life Creative Ignition Sessions and Workshops, Baja California, Mexico Individual or Group Sessions, 2017 The Art for Life sessions are held in Baja California , Mexico. New York native Zoë Dearborn offers a variety of workshops and classes to channel and reignite your creative spirit. A graduate of Oberlin College, with a master’s degree in counseling psychology and expressive arts therapy, Dearborn uses her experience as an arts therapist to “delve deep into the peak moments of your past in order to discover your callings.” With activities ranging from painting, drawing, pilates , meditation, as well as art project volunteer opportunities at the local preschool in Elias Calles, Art for Life offers a unique opportunity to customize a creative session geared toward your specific needs. Whether you’re looking to accomplish a specific creative goal like finishing a novel or just hoping to get in touch with your intuitive side, this is a wonderful option for those who like their vacations to feel à la carte.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:35:44.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
