If it doesn't, your screen may stay off after calls. / © AndroidPIT The screen misbehaves during or after calls \nThere are some known issues with the proximity sensors in some LG G5 devices. Its job is to tell when you’re holding the phone to your face and turn the screen off, but users with screen protectors report that it thinks you’re still holding the device up when you’re not. As a result, you can’t access features during calls or when a call is over - the screen stays off. \nTo resolve this issue you can: Remove the screen protector Download the AIDA64 app to confirm the sensor is functioning normally Recalibrate the sensor by typing *#546368#*model number# Now go into Device Test > SAAT > Service Menu Manual Test > Key Press Test > Call Start Battery problems? Make sure you're not running features you don't need. / © AndroidPIT LG G5: The notification LED is flaky \nMultiple users report the LED staying off when it should be telling them about incoming messages or third party app notifications. If your LED is doing the same: Go into Settings > Sound > Notification LED Make sure the switch is set to on for notifications Then just simply select the notifications you want the LED to flash for when you receive them \nIf you have already activated them, try turning them off again and then restarting your phone. Wi-Fi issues? Reboot this first. / © AndroidPIT LG G5: the Wi-Fi isn’t working \nThis is one of the most common smartphone issues, and our initial reaction is to blame - and to reboot - the Wi-Fi router. But if that isn’t the villain, try switching Wi-Fi off and on again, and if that doesn’t work go into Settings > Wi-Fi and forget the network before joining it again. If that doesn’t fix it, have a look in your power saving settings: they can disable Wi-Fi as your battery gets low. \nIt’s a similar process with Bluetooth connectivity problems. Unpairing and re-pairing devices often solves erratic connection problems. The LG G5 doesn't use an app drawer, although you can bring one back if you like. / © AndroidPIT LG G5: the app drawer isn’t there \nThat isn’t a bug: it’s a feature. Apps go to the home screens, not the app drawer, but if you miss the old way of doing things: Go to Settings > Display > Home Screen > Home Select EasyHome to recover your app drawer \nThe main downside to retrieving the app drawer this way is that it also makes the text bigger. If you don’t like how that looks, you might be better off with a third party app launcher. The LG's battery is swappable, but you shouldn't need a spare for everyday use. / © AndroidPIT LG G5: the battery drains too fast \nIf this is a recent development then the culprit is probably a rogue app. Go into Settings > Battery & Power Saving > Battery Usage Have a look to see which are the hungriest apps Adjust the individual settings for your apps to reduce the amount of battery they take up \nIf the battery drain has been constant since day one, you may just be driving the G5 too hard. Have a look in the notifications to see if there are features running that you don’t need, try turning the display brightness down a bit and tweak the power saving modes in Settings > Battery & Power Saving. You can also turn off features such as Always On and services like GPS and Bluetooth, as these can also push your battery usage over the edge. Are you getting static instead of Spotify? Playing a file might fix it. / © AndroidPIT LG G5: headphone jack makes a terrible noise \nSome users have encountered noisy static from the headphone jack when they plug in headphones or an AUX cable. \nFirst of all, try a different set of headphones or a different cable , and if that doesn’t solve the problem try connecting when the G5 isn’t connected to a power outlet: the issue seems to be more common with phones that are also charging. Failing that, you might find that opening Music to play the Life’s Good Hi-Fi track temporarily solves the problem - although it only does so if the Music app wasn’t the source of the static in the first place. \nHave you encountered any problems with your LG G5?
