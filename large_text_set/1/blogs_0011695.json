Only the game pieces are actual humans playing baseball. As we've seen documented to precision , striking that perfect deal can sometimes be a stressful process. \nOn the other side of that equation, as outfielder Mallex Smith found out on Wednesday, things can get really busy really quickly. So much so that you can find yourself a part of three separate organizations in a little over an hour. \nPhase One: \nMariners GM Jerry Dipoto and his staff pulled off a deal, acquiring Smith and pitcher Shae Simmons from the Braves for two lefty pitchers: #Mariners acquire RHP Shae Simmons & OF Mallex Smith from Atlanta for LHP Luiz Gohara & LHP Thomas Burrows. - MarinersPR (@MarinersPR) January 11, 2017 \nPhase Two: \nSo, the Mariners pick up a piece for the present and future in Smith, set to man their outfield for years to co -- oh, wait, what's that? #Mariners acquire LHP Drew Smyly from Tampa Bay for OF Mallex Smith, INF Carlos Vargas & LHP Ryan Yarbrough. - MarinersPR (@MarinersPR) January 11, 2017 \nSmith's tenure as a Mariner lasted just a shave over an hour.

So, too, does the offseason -- but at least Smith and Angels lefty Andrew Heaney are now members of a cool, special club . \nAnd a remarkable note from MLB.com's Greg Johns : the Smyly deal was the 36th trade Dipoto has completed with the Mariners since becoming their GM 16 months ago. \nJust this offseason alone, in fact, Dipoto has kept himself quite busy : This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs. more from cut4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:48:53.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
