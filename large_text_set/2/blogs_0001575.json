The FC crew assess why Man United have had such a deficiency in goal-scoring this season. Former Arsenal midfielder Stewart Robson backs Arsenal to earn a result against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. \nW2W4 previews the weekend's Premier League action by highlighting the key storylines. \nAnother defeat would mean crisis for Liverpool \nJanuary was a bad month for Liverpool, who lost three consecutive home games and exited two cup competitions. Indeed, the only side they beat in nine games last month was League Two club Plymouth. \nIn terms of the Premier League alone, though, talk of crisis has been slightly overblown: Liverpool remain in the top four, a point behind Arsenal and Tottenham, and are still well-placed to qualify for the Champions League. That was this season's primary realistic aim, given their squad is probably too thin to sustain a title challenge. \nAll that said, though, there might be more cause for panic if Hull are victorious on Saturday. Despite the upturn in their performances under Marco Silva, they remain a side that is second-bottom and heading for relegation unless there's quite a turnaround. \nFor Liverpool's sake, hopefully Tuesday's creditable draw with Chelsea is more an indication of their immediate future, rather than the few weeks that preceded it. \nWill Arsenal get it right mentally? \nIn good times and bad, Arsene Wenger often talks about his team's mentality and he hit upon the topic again after Arsenal's defeat to Watford on Wednesday, stating his men weren't \"mentally ready\" for the task of facing a team that hadn't won a Premier League game since Dec. 10. \nIt doesn't bode well for their chances at the home of leaders Chelsea on Saturday, but Arsenal's record in big games this season has been quite good. They lost to Liverpool on the opening day and at Manchester City just before Christmas but, other than that, are unbeaten against the other clubs currently in the top six. \nIn each of those two defeats, Arsenal led only for periods of psychological carelessness to cost them: Liverpool scored three goals in 14 minutes, while Man City surged back in the second half as Wenger's men lost their concentration and their way. Similar mental lapses at Chelsea will lead to a similar result. \nWhat to make of Mourinho and Manchester United? Manchester United are winless in their last three Premier League games. \nJose Mourinho's side haven't lost in 14 league games but are still sixth, 14 points shy of Chelsea and four outside the Champions League spots. The United manager's post-match tantrum after Wednesday's 0-0 home draw vs. Hull was a sign that distraction is required. \nIf he's so confident of his methods, his team and the path they're on, why not write off a 0-0 draw against a team who were happy with a point as the sort of game that happens sometimes? Are his public appearances an expression of his insecurities? \nIt's tricky what to make of United at the moment; only wins, starting against Leicester on Sunday, will clear things up. \nBerahino returns to the Hawthorns \nHaving made his West Brom debut in August 2012, Saido Berahino first started making serious noises about leaving the club at the end of 2014 but only finally did exit in January 2017. \nIn short, he almost spent longer trying to leave the Baggies than actually playing for them. But he won't have to wait long to return, as he goes back to the Hawthorns this weekend with new club Stoke, having made his debut as a substitute against Everton on Wednesday. He is almost certain to get a lively reception. \nThe question is whether the Â£12 million signing will actually get into the starting line-up: Peter Crouch, who many thought had reached the end of his usefulness, is in sparkling form for Mark Hughes's side and has scored four goals in his last five games. \nTottenham can't afford more dropped points \nMauricio Pochettino cut a frustrated figure on Tuesday after his Spurs side drew at Sunderland to miss, in his words, a \"massive opportunity\" to close the gap on Chelsea. With nine points separating them from the top and three teams either level with them or just a point behind, Spurs have no room for further slips. \nThat necessity is accentuated given their upcoming fixtures; the return of the Europa League is set to clog the schedule and there is also a trip to Liverpool next Saturday to consider. Middlesbrough are doughty opponents -- only five Premier League teams have a better defensive record -- so victory will not be easy, but it's one Tottenham need. \nNick Miller is a writer for ESPN FC, covering Premier League and European football.
