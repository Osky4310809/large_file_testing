Trends US Elections 2016 \nLast month, the outgoing president asked US intelligence agencies to conduct a full review of the alleged “Russian hacking” and demanded to see the report before he leaves office on 20 January. Obama received a classified briefing about the alleged Russian involvement in the election on Thursday morning, the White House said. \n“The White House does have the report and President Obama is being briefed on it by a range of senior officials that are members of his national security team,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.

As Earnest made the revelation, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told Congress that an unclassified version of the intelligence report will be released “early next week.” Read more US expels 35 Russian diplomats, closes 2 compounds \n“It’s important for the American people to understand that it’s our democracy that has been interfered with,” Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee, adding that authorities will make “as much of it [text] public as they possibly can.” \nPresident elect Donald Trump, who has criticized Obama’s handling of the alleged hacking scandal, is scheduled to receive his own briefing on the report Friday. Members of Congress will get a classified briefing on Monday before the report is released. \nThe Obama administration and the losing Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, have accused Moscow of being behind the alleged cyberattacks that targeted Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, during their ill-fated campaign. \nThey insisted that the whistleblower website WikiLeaks obtained the damaging emails, which supposedly damaged Clinton’s chances to win, not from an insider or a casual hacker but directly from Russian intelligence agencies. \nREAD MORE: ‘Fake cyber war’: Hacker ‘Guccifer’ says US obsessed with Russian invasion \nThe claims have consistently been denied by both WikiLeaks and Moscow, with Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling them “nonsense” in an interview with RT.
