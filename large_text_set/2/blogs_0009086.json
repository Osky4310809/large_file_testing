And writer Mark Gatiss agrees: a woman would be “fantastic.”\n“I think it’d be really good for the show,” he recently told Simon Mayo on BBC Radio 2 show Drivetime. “It’s been back for 12 years, which means it’s not the new kid on the block anymore; it’s not a revival, it’s been back for a long time.\n“It’s the sort of thing I think would bring an amazing new audience to it,” Gatiss continued. “I think it’d be fantastic. But who knows, it’s up to [incoming showrunner] Chris Chibnall.”\nGatiss, who is writing one episode of the show’s upcoming 10th season, reiterated his thoughts in a Thursday interview with British newspaper Metro , saying that “I do think it would be wonderful to have a female Doctor.”\n“Not because of ‘ticking boxes’ but because it feels right and would be great for the show,” he said, declining to name names, “as that person then appears on [betting service] Ladbrokes lists even if they have no interest in the part.”\nPeople are coming out in droves to support a woman in the role, which has been portrayed by 13 men over five decades.\nIMDb (Getty Images)\nCurrent Doctor Peter Capaldi, who will regenerate in this year’s Christmas special, tipped Frances de la Tour (above; Harry Potter , History Boys ) to be the first female Doctor. Predecessors Paul McGann (Eighth Doctor) thinks Tilda Swinton ( Hail, Caesar! , Doctor Strange ) should step into the role , while David Tennant (Tenth Doctor) called Broadchurch co-star and regular bookie favorite Olivia Colman (below) “a magnificent choice.”\nIMDb (BBC)\nViewers shouldn’t count out Capaldi just yet: The Scottish actor still has 12 episodes to kick alien butt and save the human race—with the help of new companions Bill (Pearl Mackie) and Nardole (Matt Lucas).\nChristmas Day 2017 marks the last words of showrunner Steven Moffat and the final flicks of the 12th Doctor’s sonic screwdriver. But who will materialize out of the character’s fiery rebirth in December?\nBookmakers have their money on Kris Marshall, known to US audiences as Love Actually ‘s horny Colin Frissell. Around the same time Capaldi dropped his bombshell, Marshall revealed he would step down from the BBC’s Death in Paradise , sparking rumors that the timing is not just a coincidence. Colman, Maxine Peake ( The Theory of Everything ), Reece Shearsmith ( Shaun of the Dead ), Ben Whishaw (Daniel Craig’s Bond movies), Paterson Joseph ( The Leftovers ), and Andrew Lee Potts ( Stan Lee’s Lucky Man ) are also favored.\nBBC soap opera EastEnders star and cockney lad Danny Dyer, meanwhile, has the Internet in a tizzy since revealing an interest in stepping into the TARDIS.\nBBC\n“I could see myself in the scarf and all that,” the actor said, referencing Tom Baker’s fourth incarnation of the Doctor. “I think I could do it easily. I’d keep my accent, too,” he told the Daily Star .\nThere is no indication that Dyer, who plays Mick Carter in the long-running BBC One soap, is actually in the running to play the part. But he was the subject of a rejected petition asking that the Beeb “must replace Peter Capaldi with Danny Dyer as the next Doctor Who.”\nDon’t hold your breath for news of the Doctor’s successor anytime soon. Chibnall, still attached to Broadchurch —which returns to the UK’s ITV on Feb. 27, for what is likely its final eight-episode arc— plans to take a vacation before diving into Doctor Who .\nA new star is expected to be cast by the fall, ahead of an official announcement and an on-screen regeneration.", "external_links": ["http://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/david-tennant-says-olivia-colman-would-be-magnificent-choice-to-replace-peter-capaldi-on-doctor-who-a3455191.html", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08bqzyb", "http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-02-01/peter-capaldi-wants-this-female-harry-potter-star-to-be-his-doctor-who-successor", "http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-02-01/eighth-doctor-paul-mcgann-thinks-tilda-swinton-should-replace-peter-capaldi-in-doctor-who", "http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/586576/doctor-who-rumours-danny-dyer-replace-peter-capaldi-cockney-eastenders", "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/182333"], "published": "2017-02-10T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:10:09.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
