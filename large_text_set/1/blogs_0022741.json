However BVB have continually reiterated their stance that Pulisic is not for sale, with general manager Michael Zorc declaring last month: \"We have communicated very clearly that we won't sell Christian and that he's very much part of our plans. Liverpool don't need to waste time. They can save their money.” Pulisic in Champions League action against Real Madrid (Photo: 2016 Getty Images) Read More Transfer news LIVE: All the latest from the January window \nNow, after a strong season, where he has seen regular action - featuring 19 times despite competition from the likes of Ousmane Dembele, Andre Schurrle, Marco Reus and Emre Mor - he has now been handed a new deal. \n\"Christian is already an important figure within the team and, like Julian Weigl, set to become a cornerstone of our sporting future,\" said Zorc. \n\"I still have a lot to learn,\" says Pulisic. \"Here in Dortmund I find are the best conditions for me. And here I have the chance to play in front of over 80,000 spectators. We have the best fans in the world - it can not be better.\" \nHis development has continued to accelerate under Thomas Tuchel this term and now he has signed improved terms, with a year extension on top. \nPulisic's renewal comes after BVB fought off competition from Real Madrid to sign Swedish sensation Alexander Isak. \nThe 17-year-old has joined in an £8.6million move from AIK.
