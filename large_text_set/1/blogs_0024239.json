Ahmad Al-rubaye 10399832 “That is not to say those leaders should do something else — they could argue that the value of their policies shouldn’t be judged only by whether it helps with ISIS recruitment and that they will curb jihadist recruitment in the long term,” McCants added. “I believe that argument is wrongheaded, but reasonable people will disagree. Still, it’s plain that there’s an awful lot of overlap between the way ISIS and Western populists talk about Muslims in the West.”\nAt a restaurant in Istanbul, Abu Musab’s eyes darted around the room as he explained his decision to leave ISIS. He said he was unhappy that the group had killed fellow Sunni Muslims, including members of his family, and that he had come to see its leaders as power-hungry and corrupt. He also said he believed that Trump’s presidency will help their cause. “For me, Trump is an enemy of Muslims, and he is my enemy,” he said. “Trump’s hatred of Muslims will unite them against the injustice, and unfortunately that will benefit ISIS.”\nIn the wake of Trump’s upset win in November, ISIS supporters and hard-line Islamists rushed to promote the result as a validation of their views of America. “#Trump reveals the true mentality and racism of the Americans toward Muslims and Arabs. Trump only shows what his predecessors were hiding,” the Jordan-based Salafist ideologue Abu-Muhammad al-Maqdisi wrote on Twitter. An essay posted online by the ISIS-affiliated al-Minbar Jihadi Media network on election night boasted that “Trump’s win of the American presidency will bring hostility of Muslims against America as a result of his reckless actions, which show the overt and hidden hatred against them.”\nOn the ground in Syria, meanwhile, the rush to capitalize on Trump’s win was on immediate display.\nA former ISIS fighter in his twenties spent the end of the US election season posted to a front line near Palmyra. He first heard of Trump this fall, he said, when a group of foreign militants mentioned him. “They told me that he was against Islam, and that they hoped that he would win, because if he did it would be a reason to unite Muslim countries,” recalled the former fighter, who defected and fled to Turkey in December. But more senior ISIS members dismissed Trump’s chances of winning. “There is no way this crazy guy will win the election,” he remembered one of them saying.\nIn the darkness before dawn every day, a group of about 50 fighters from his outpost would wake up and drive out in cars, their headlights switched off, to a nearby farm. There, beneath a canopy of green sheets spread between tree branches to provide cover from US drones and fighter jets, an ISIS imam led the group in morning prayers. The imam was their link to ISIS leadership, and after prayers he would spend about an hour leading the soldiers in religious lessons and discussions on battle plans. On the morning after the election, though, the soldiers found the imam in an excited mood. He devoted the entire hour to Trump and his electoral win, imploring the fighters to seize the initiative. “He said that now Trump won the election, and he is an enemy of Islam, and we have to use this chance because it’s on our side,” the former fighter said. “He said we have to be smart and use social media to call people to come and join us.”\n“Civilians believe they will be victims in Trump’s war against ISIS, and that their blood is cheap not only for Trump but for ISIS, too.”\nID: 10399120 The former fighter said he defected because ISIS had ordered him to move to Aleppo, where he would have to battle rival Syrian rebel groups instead of the regime. In a meeting near the Turkish border, he spoke on condition of anonymity because he planned to join one of those rival rebel groups soon and fight ISIS himself. He said he didn’t have an opinion of the new US leader — “I only know what’s going on in Syria,” he said — but that he had noticed that ISIS’s interest in Trump remained intense in the days that followed his victory. Men with video cameras started to appear at the prayer meetings at the farm. They would record when the imam turned to Trump, which he began to do frequently. “Every day he was talking about Trump,” he said.\nThe cameras were there to film ISIS propaganda — the speeches delivered to soldiers at the front, like the celebratory posts circulated by ISIS and its backers online, were part of the group’s extensive messaging machine. This machine would have kicked into gear even if Clinton had won — just as it was running during the presidency of Barack Obama, whom ISIS members referred to, like Trump, as a “dog,” a “pig,” and an enemy of Islam.\n“From the standpoint of a propagandist, it always makes sense to claim that a certain development only bolsters the propagandist’s case even more so. It’s therefore unsurprising that ISIS members are claiming that Trump’s victory will strengthen the organization,” said Eric Trager, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “The fact is that ISIS was perfectly dangerous, and very much able to use other propaganda points to recruit followers and attackers, well before Trump emerged. Ultimately ISIS is highly consistent and wants to kill as many people as possible, irrespective of who the US president is.”\nThe ISIS official outside Palmyra suggested that the advantage he saw in Trump’s win was one of degrees. “We will not change our strategy after this election, because we only have one strategy, which is fight infidels and the Islamic State’s enemies and spread Islam,” he said. “But Trump will shorten the time it takes for us to achieve our goals.”\nView this image ›\nAn ISIS flag posted on a road in Manbij, in northern Syria, on June 23, 2016. Delil Souleiman / AFP / Getty Images\nID: 10399866 A second ISIS official, based outside of Aleppo, said that — aside from propaganda — he believed that Trump’s inauguration would have little effect on the group’s strategy. “The Islamic State didn’t change its plans,” he said, in response to written questions sent via an intermediary. “For sure Trump or any president will be against the Islamic State, because we’re sure there is an organized infidel campaign.”\nThe official also seemed to sense that a heavier US-led battle might be on the way. He said that one reaction to Trump’s win among civilians living in ISIS territory had been fears of more intense bombardment, while he tried to strike a defiant note on behalf of the group’s fighters. “I and all the brothers here are not afraid of death or of Trump,” he said.\nBoth ISIS officials agreed to interviews on condition of anonymity to avoid retribution from the group for speaking to the Western press.\nAhmed, a 29-year-old former ISIS member, remembered some fighters talking tough to a group of civilians as they waited in line at a bakery in Raqqa after the election one day, vowing that ISIS would kill Trump. “But the people knew that they were talking bullshit,” he said. He asked to withhold his last name to protect his safety.\nA onetime fighter who had been assigned by ISIS to work at the bakery, Ahmed recalled a wave of concern among civilians in the city who worried that the Trump administration would follow through on his promises to intensify the war. “I have no idea if ISIS will change its plans, but I can explain how civilians were thinking,” he said, speaking via encrypted chat from rebel-held territory in Syria, where he fled after defecting in December. “Civilians believe they will be victims in Trump’s war against ISIS, and that their blood is cheap not only for Trump but for ISIS, too. They are expecting death.”\nISIS is besieged on many fronts. It faces the loss of a major stronghold, the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, where the Iraqi military said last week that it had retaken the eastern half of the city. US-backed Kurdish militants and their allies are meanwhile eating away at ISIS territory outside Raqqa, and the Turkish military, which succeeded last fall in clearing ISIS from the Turkey-Syria border, is continuing to press its offensive against the militants.\nTrump’s military strategy against ISIS remains unclear as he puts his team in place. Barry Pavel, the director of the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security at the Atlantic Council, said indications so far are that the war could ramp up after years of hesitance by the Obama administration to get too deeply involved. “My guess is that you’ll have a more normal military operation in the sense that all of the constraints on rules of engagement and the low tempo of operations will be removed,” he said.\nWhether perceptions that Trump is anti-Muslim will hamper the ISIS fight, which has relied heavily on partnering with local forces, remains to be seen. “To me it’s a spectrum. If you define the jihadist problem as close to the actual religion, then that gets you into trouble. If you define it as a radical ideology that twists the religion, then you’re in a better position to fight the ideological battle,” Pavel said. “Will the administration demonize an entire religion and make things an order of magnitude worse?”\nID: 10399277 With additional reporting by Nancy A.
