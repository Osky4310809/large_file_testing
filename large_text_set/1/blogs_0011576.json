It's not hyperbole to say the sneaker's release was revolutionaryâ€”and a bold step forward in the technology-first space for Adidas. It was the first Originals sneaker to feature Boost technology (the squishy foam-like sole unit that customers can't seem to get enough of), but since then has proven to be so much more than just a cool new product for Adidas. Since launching, the NMD has in many ways become the signature cool kid sneaker of today in all of its various iterations. Now, the NMD that started it all is coming back this Saturday, January 14. \nThe success of the NMD line is bigger than the fact it sells out and that certain models go for, on average, three-to-four times their $130 price tag on the re-sell market. Rather, it signals that Adidas can generate buzz off of more than reissues of retro styles and celebrity endorsements; it can create new, innovative sneakers that push the entire industry forward. In the sneaker world, a silhouette that connects with customers on a level bigger than hype are pretty much the pinnacle of success. \nBut because they're so popular, don't expect the NMD OG to be easy to get when it hits adidas.com this weekend. With that in mind, here are a few other stores that will stock the re-release. Best of luck to everyone trying to pick up this piece of modern sneaker history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:13:26.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
