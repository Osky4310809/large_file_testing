Well, most of them speak for themselves (hello, hip thrust!), but these moves do pack some real fitness benefits. \nThe granddaddy of sexy exercises, the hip thrust, targets the glutes, which makes for some powerful pumping. Movements like the happy baby and the couch stretch will keep you nice and limber, so you don't cramp up during positions that require a little flexibility. \nGaddour also includes some strength moves that will allow you to manhandle your partner in the bedroom (if that's what you're into, you tiger). Flexed curls and sandbag bear hug squats mean you can spice things up by holding your partner upright. Different pushup styles will aide you with upper-body strength and stamina when you're on top. \nEven if you don't have a wild Valentine's Day planned, all of these movements can be included in your regular workout routine to improve strength and stamina for any intense physical activity.
