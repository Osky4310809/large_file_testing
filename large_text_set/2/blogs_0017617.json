Look, this is a-no-win,” Limbaugh said . “Nobody’s gonna win anything by deporting a bunch of kids that we let in, whoever did, Obama, whatever.” \nThe DREAMers aren’t necessarily “kids” as they could have been up to 31 years old when applying for protection in 2012. Limbaugh went on to say: “Look, there’s a caveat here. In order for the DREAMer thing to be acceptable, the rest of this stuff has to be by the book. No amnesty for anybody other than the DREAMers. We enforce existing law. We turn the Border Patrol agents loose to find people they already know exist and they already know where they are and deport them.” \n“If that happens, and if they move on the wall, if they move on strict border control, then the DREAMer thing is a worthwhile compromise,” Limbaugh added. \nLimbaugh said that President Trump is “thinking about an exemption” for DREAMers, but this isn’t necessarily true. However, White House press secretary Sean Spicer has been sounding very much like an Obama administration spokesperson regarding DREAMers. \n“The President is very clear about his priorities with respect to immigration. Yesterday was focused on going after people who are a concern — a public safety concern,” Spicer said during a press briefing Wednesday. \nObama’s press secretary Josh Earnest said in July 2015 that the Obama administration is “focusing” its “law enforcement efforts on those individuals who pose a genuine threat to public safety and national security.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:44:27.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
