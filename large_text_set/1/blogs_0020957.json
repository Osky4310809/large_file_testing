(Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA) \nShares of Charter Communications jumped nearly 10% in pre-market trading Thursday following a report of a potential deal with Verizon. \nAccording to The Wall Street Journal , Verizon is exploring a \"combination\" with the cable company, which acquired Time Warner Cable last year for $56 billion. \nThe report says Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam approached Charter officials about a deal and is studying a combination with advisers. \nVerizon boasts a combined 10.4 million FiOS customers between broadband and video, while Charter services a combined 38 million customers with its Internet and TV offerings. \nA possible merger would give Verizon a boost as it battles with rival AT&T, the owner of DirecTV satellite television service. Last year, AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent of Time Warner Cable and owner of media properties including CNN, HBO and Warner Bros. \nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .
