We’ve seen some great renovations snag a lot at sale, and more recently, a well-maintained, very large house in a big lot sell for over asking price . We’ve seen others ask way too much (it’s since dropped in price by $55k). This new listing has some pretty great curb appeal, has been well-maintained through the years, and it’s listing for $389,900. The 3,119-square-foot house has five bedrooms, three full and two half baths, and a finished basement. There’s also a wood paneled den, a bright sun room, and a kitchen with kind of an awkward layout and breakfast nook. The house is full of original detail, like Pewabic tile, leaded glass, hardwood floors, and arched doorways. The backyard looks a little small, but there’s a three car garage. Located near the Avenue of Fashion, Palmer Woods, and Sherwood Forest, let us know what you think about this one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T01:34:30.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
