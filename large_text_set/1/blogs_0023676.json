This is the kind of truth that is true “whether or not you believe in [it],” he said, “so I would recommend that if you base policy on any kind of truth, it should be that truth.” \nThe second truth involved someone that’s true just for you (like religion), even if you can’t objectively prove it. \nThe third category was reserved for someone like Donald Trump. \nThe third kind of truth, he said, is what he calls “political truth.” “That’s what’s true simply because you repeat it so often that everyone thinks that it’s true, even if it’s not the truth,” Tyson said. \nSadly, we’re living in a country where this kind of alternative truth — a.k.a. A lie — is spreading faster than we can contain it. We have to be vigilant and vocal if we want our society governed by objective truths.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T13:28:46.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
