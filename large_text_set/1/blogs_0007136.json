According to him, Magu is not indispensable. The Senate Leader noted that he would agree with whatever is the outcome of the probe by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), on the allegations against Magu. Ndume told our correspondent in an interview that if the allegations in the security report by the Department of State Services were found to be true, he would not insist on Magu. The Senate Leader, however, stated that he would continue to insist on fair hearing for the EFCC boss. The Senate had said it could not confirm Magu’s nomination by President Buhari based on DSS report in which the nominee was accused of corruption-related offences and recommended that he was ineligible for the office. But Ndume had dismissed the claim by the Senate that Magu’s nomination had been rejected, stating that only the President could determine the fate of the nominee. The senator had alleged that Magu’s “rejection” was smuggled into the announcement of the Senate’s decision by some lawmakers. Based on Buhari’s directive, Malami had queried Magu over the allegations against him, which the acting EFCC boss had replied. Ndume hailed President Buhari for calling for an independent probe into Magu’s case. He said, “When these allegations were levelled against Magu, he should be given the opportunity to respond. Based on that, the President will take his decision.” When asked if the Senate Leader would be satisfied with the outcome of Malami’s probe, he said, “Yes. If Magu is found wanting and there is evidence beyond reasonable doubt to that effect, why not? He is not indispensable. But if he is innocent, we should move ahead with his confirmation. “What I am worried about is due process. Now, allegations have been levelled against him; he has been given an opportunity to respond to those allegations and he has responded (to them). His principal – Mr. President – will look at his (Magu’s) response to those allegations. If he is satisfied that he (Magu) is innocent, we will move ahead. But if Magu is found wanting, I can’t say that he should be considered.” The Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Senator David Umaru, had last week corroborated Ndume, saying Magu’s confirmation had not been discussed at plenary. Umaru, who is representing Niger East Senatorial District, stated that Magu’s issue “was never voted on in plenary, so, as far as I am concerned, Magu’s nomination was never rejected”. He added, “If somebody says it was rejected, it was probably a mistake because I have not voted. The Senate operates by the rules (and) the rule is that this thing must be presented to us either by the committee or through direct interaction with the members in plenary; none of this has happened. “Magu’s issue was discussed only in the executive session of the Senate. It was not an issue discussed at plenary, so anything done in the executive session is not the same thing as that done in plenary, so as far as I am concerned the issue of Magu, the consideration of his nomination was never considered by the Senate.” Following the allegation of corruption levelled against the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Babachir Lawal and Magu, by the Senate and DSS, respectively, President Buhari had directed the AGF to probe all top government officials accused of corruption. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, had in a statement said that any of the government official found guilty of the allegations levelled against them would not escape prosecution.
