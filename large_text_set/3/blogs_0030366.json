Watts said she saw two girls stopped from boarding a flight Minneapolis by a gate agent. \n“She’s forcing them to change or put dresses on over leggings or they can’t board,” Watts wrote . “Since when does United police women’s clothing?” \nAccording to Watts, the gate agent then said “she doesn’t make the rules, just follows them”. Watts said “a 10-year-old girl in gray leggings” who “looked normal and appropriate” was forced to change her clothing before boarding. \nUnited did not immediately respond to a phone call or email with questions. The airline’s Twitter account, however, responded directly to Watts, saying: “The passengers this morning were United pass riders who were not in compliance with our dress code policy for company benefit travel. \n“In our contract of carriage, rule 21, we do have the right to refuse transport for passengers. This is left to the discretion of the gate agents.” \nThe passengers were “pass riders”, the company said , defining such fliers as “United employees or eligible dependents” who fly when possible as a “company benefit”. United (@united) The passengers this morning were United pass riders who were not in compliance with our dress code policy for company benefit travel. March 26, 2017 \n“There is a dress code for pass travelers as they are representing UA when they fly,” United wrote . “Casual attire is allowed as long as it looks neat and is in good taste for the local environment.” \nThe company’s passenger contract says that it can bar people who are “barefoot or not properly clothed”. It does not elaborate on that description. \nWatts said that the company’s behavior was “sexist and sexualizes young girls. Not to mention that the families were mortified and inconveni[en]nced”. She added : “Their father, who was allowed to board with no issue, was wearing shorts.” \nJonathan Guerin, a spokesman for the airline, told the Washington Post the girls “were not in compliance with our dress code policy for company benefit travel”. \n“Our regular passengers are not going to be denied boarding because they are wearing leggings or yoga pants,” Guerin said. “But when flying as a pass traveler, we require pass travelers to follow rules, and that is one of those rules.” William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) March 26, 2017 \nSeveral celebrities poured scorn on United, some threatening to stop flying with the company. \n“I have flown United before with literally no pants on. Just a top as a dress.” the model Chrissy Teigen wrote . “Next time I will wear only jeans and a scarf.” \nTold of United’s policy for pass riders, Teigen said: “Honestly I don’t really care. If I have an issue with a company, I stop giving them money.” \nThe Oscar-winning actor Patricia Arquette called United’s actions “terrible” and rejected the company’s attempt to explain its policy. “Leggings are business attire for 10 year olds,” Arquette wrote in response to the explanation about “casual attire”. “Their business is being children.” \nThe actor LeVar Burton had a similar exchange with the company, writing : “The punitive measures taken are not a good look!” \nAfter telling the company she might change all her upcoming United flights to other airlines, the comedian Sarah Silverman received an explanation of the company’s policy. \n“I understand,” Silverman replied . “I suggest u consider updating ur rules 4 friends & fam as they seem to apply mostly 2 females & are outdated.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:04:11.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
