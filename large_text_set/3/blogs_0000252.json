On Monday, @WEdwarda tweeted a photo of the 8-year-old girl on Twitter, writing, “8 year-old-girl from Alabama picks Melania Trump for her schools favorite first lady project. So cute!” 8 year old girl from Alabama picks Melania Trump for her schools favorite first lady project. So cute! pic.twitter.com/AqLylSd3hw \n— Ava- I love my USA! (@WEdwarda) February 27, 2017 The girl is dressed in a pint-sized version of Trump’s powder blue inaugural outfit: a Ralph Lauren dress with matching coat, leather gloves, and stilettos. Mini Melania also wears her hair in an updo and carries a bright blue box, similar to the one from Tiffany & Co. that the first lady gifted to Michelle Obama. The poster, whose name is Ava and whose Twitter bio reads, “Christian Constitutional Conservative,” did not respond to Yahoo Style’s request for the identity of the little girl, but the photo, which received nearly 3,000 retweets and 6,000 likes, is being called “adorable” and “classy.” A few followers even tweeted the image at the FLOTUS herself. Melania Trump has an approval rating of 47 percent, according to a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll, and she’s been declared a fashion icon. Her style has been compared to that of former first ladies Jackie Kennedy and Nancy Reagan; she helped design her white, off-the-shoulder inauguration gown ; and she made an unintentional political statement at a presidential debate in October (remember the pussy bow blouse ?). And while several designers have refused to dress FLOTUS due to clashing political views, she clearly has an adoring fan in Alabama. It’s been an interesting time for little girls and politics. In celebration of February’s Black History Month, 5-year-old Lola Jones in Kent, Wash., is dressing up each day as a different civil rights leader in a photo series produced by her mother. So far, the little girl has reimagined Rosa Parks, Nina Simone, Maya Angelou, and Bessie Coleman, just to name a few. Through make-believe, Lola is not only learning about history but also inspiring little girls to dream bigger.
