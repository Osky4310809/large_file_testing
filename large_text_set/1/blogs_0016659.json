The announcement states that Samsung will be providing its \"flagship\" processors, which bodes well for the performance of in-dash applications.\n\nWhile Audi has various other deals with chip makers to run its self-driving and autonomous car efforts, there's always a niche to be carved out for running smaller systems. Samsung says that its newest Exynos processors can handle running four different displays in the car at once thanks to its advanced graphics processing power. Each of the displays can run intense interfaces with various levels of user interaction.\nSamsung's own Exynos processors have historically been among the most powerful available, capable of running high-end phones and tablets, so there's no doubt an Exynos processor can handle a car's infotainment systems without a hitch.\nSamsung Samsung is a massive South Korea-based multinational company that makes some of the best-selling phones, tablets and mobile accessories, but also spans industries such as televisions, appliances and semiconductors (like memory and processors). Samsung is the largest Android device manufacturer worldwide.\nBest Samsung phones Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review Best microSD card for Android ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T20:37:54.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
