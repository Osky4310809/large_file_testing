The Round 3 clash for which Foran may return is against the Bulldogs on Friday night at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin - a Dogs home game that the club elected to take to New Zealand. \nAta Hingano played five-eighth alongside halfback Shaun Johnson in the Warriors’ last start - a 26-10 defeat to the Storm on Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T01:49:19.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
