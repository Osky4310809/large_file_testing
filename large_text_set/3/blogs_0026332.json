I know this because of Facebook. The site reminded me this morning within \" On This Day ,\" a feature that surfaces my own Facebook posts from that day but in years prior.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook is tweaking the News Feed to crack down on 'alternative facts'\nToday is the second anniversary of On This Day, a tool that Facebook has repeatedly said publicly — and said to me — is globally rolled out.\nIt isn't.\nThis is not my first time breaking this very important news. Back in May 2016, I wrote about it, with the headline, \" Facebook ‘On This Day’ Does Not Reach All Users — Even 14 Months Into A Global Rollout. \"\nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment at that time. Since then, I've had conversations with probably a 100 different people at Facebook and asked them to provide me with an answer. Nada.\nI even wrote an exclusive feature about Facebook's Goodwill team and their effort to add more News Feed cards and shareable moments, similar to the fashion of On This Day. Still, they told me it was globally rolled out. Trust me. It hasn't.\nHow did I make this discovery? Turns out my two best friends didn't have the feature — at the time and still today. That meant neither of them knew when our Facebook Friendiversary was (the horror!) nor could they benefit (or cry) from a daily viewing of their old posts.\nTrust me, Facebook. I asked one of those friends to go to facebook.com/onthisday today and this is what she sees:\nI also did a Twitter and a Facebook callout this morning. Nicholas Deleon, consumer tech editor of Motherboard, also doesn't have access, I learned today.\nProof:\nImage: Nicholas Deleon\nIn fact, since I wrote that story in May 2016, dozens of people have slid into my Twitter DMs or messaged me on Facebook asking if I ever found out the reason why and asking how I could get them access.\nI don't have an answer for them, unfortunately.\nAccording to a software engineer at Facebook I spoke to, his company could be withholding access to some users in a type of experiment. But that doesn't really make sense, he admitted, two years into the product.\nOkay, so maybe it's not the end of the world. As Deleon said, \"I forgot it existed,\" after he saw my Twitter callout. And I know there are many people in the Facebook world who DON'T like seeing it.\n\"It's often annoying,\" someone else told me.\nBut that doesn't mean it's fair to leave so many without a choice. Essentially the right to decide if they want to see their memories, whatever they may be, or not.\nSo please dear Facebook, tell me why.\nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment.\nWATCH: Watch these privileged babies indulge in their very own day spa", "external_links": ["http://www.ibtimes.com/facebook-day-does-not-reach-all-users-even-14-months-global-rollout-2371890", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nKxSGl_o0cJ5RIwAA0429L75F34=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425603%2F21c9f3f6-536f-4855-acd3-a810dae33299.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/NpNdo7E9.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/NpNdo7E9.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8ZTVeqcQdOetH8-ymh_mOF-FaNE=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425603%2F21c9f3f6-536f-4855-acd3-a810dae33299.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hCk5REDA_lHBmwZrObDto5cgLB0=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425610%2Fad76bf31-a783-4ee4-b39e-bb98e1570727.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TUcfhIfoJQVAZx4AvgzO0bl7B1g=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425610%2Fad76bf31-a783-4ee4-b39e-bb98e1570727.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-25T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:23:58.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
