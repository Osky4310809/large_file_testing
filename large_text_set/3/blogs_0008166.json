Cinépolis is trying another strategy to entice moviegoers: playgrounds.\nThe company's \" Cinepolis Junior \" theaters for kids have been in Mexico, Spain and other Latin American countries for years, but next week, two are opening for the first time in the states.\nThe two auditoriums in Southern California will feature slides, a play area with climbing structures, stationary pogo stick-like toys, a merry-go-round spinning thing, bean bag seats and lounge chairs up front. This does not look like your normal theater. And it probably won't sound like one either.\nAnnouncing the first ever dedicated children’s movie theater auditoriums in the U.S., #CinepolisJunior! Featuring a play structure with slides, play area with tire-climbers, unique seating like bean bags and lounge chairs, and much more, Cinépolis Junior is making its debut at Cinépolis Pico Rivera and Cinépolis Vista on March 16.

They'll only show kid-friendly movies, so don't expect to plunk the little ones on the slide and enjoy Get Out .\nNo sliding and playing will be allowed during the movie. Instead, kids have 20 minutes before start time to run around and play. Once the movie starts, they need to sit down and pay attention or at least be quiet — and that includes adults.\nSo much for Netflix and chill.\nWATCH: New robot with built-in projector turns any room into a movie theater", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/I3B7LL4Y.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/I3B7LL4Y.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRWLwKfgFb7/", "http://www.cinepolisusa.com/locations.aspx", "http://www.cinepolis.com/sala-junior"], "published": "2017-03-10T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:07:23.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
