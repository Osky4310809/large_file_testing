Rod Culleton recovering at home after altercation outside Perth court Read more \nThe court granted a 21-day stay on the bankruptcy order , which ends on Friday. \nParry says he is waiting for the federal court to formally notify him of the end of the order’s stay, and once he receives that he will tell Western Australia’s governor there is a Senate vacancy to be filled. \nHe has rejected Culleton’s request to recall the upper house to decide on the validity of the federal court’s ruling, saying the constitution gives no discretion to the Senate to disregard a “disqualifying event”, such as a bankruptcy ruling by a court. \nIt means Culleton’s career as a senator could be over in days. \nParry says who fills the vacancy left by Culleton’s departure will be a matter for the high court. That decision will be determined by the outcome of a separate legal matter being heard in the high court over Culleton’s eligibility to contest the 2 July election after a larceny conviction, which was later annulled. \nIf the high court rules Culleton’s election was invalid then it may order a vote recount which could result in Culleton being replaced by his brother-in-law Peter Georgiou, who was No 2 on the One Nation Senate ticket in WA, or a candidate from another political party. \nBut if the court finds Culleton was eligible to stand at the election there would be a casual vacancy under section 15 of the constitution and One Nation would be able to nominate another person for the seat.
