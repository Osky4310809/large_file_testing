According to the Evening Standard 's Tom Collomosse , both the Gunners and West Ham United are interested in signing Gibson, 24, who could well become available should Boro get relegated, with the north-east side likely to demand up to £30 million for him. Collomosse added that Arsenal could decide to cash in on 32-year-old Mertesacker in the summer as his contract expires in 2018, and his departure would leave a centre-back place available that could potentially be filled by Gibson. While Germany international Mertesacker is club captain and has a wealth of experience, he has been absent for all of the 2016-17 season so far through injury, lacks the sharpness he once did and is some way down the pecking order at the Emirates Stadium. Dan Mullan/Getty Images Gibson, on the other hand, is an exciting young defensive talent who has performed admirably for struggling Boro in the Premier League this season, playing every minute for Aitor Karanka's side in the English top flight, per WhoScored.com . Middlesbrough are in danger of relegation at the moment, having earned only 22 points from 27 matches, but it has mainly been their attack that has struggled—they have scored just 19 Premier League goals all season. For a side currently in the relegation zone, Boro's defensive record is very impressive—their 30 goals conceded is bettered only by Chelsea , Tottenham Hotspur , Manchester United and Manchester City . That is in no small part down to Gibson's excellence, and should he continue to make good on his potential, he could well become a top Premier League defender—Chelsea and Manchester City are also reportedly interested in him, per football commentator Ian Abrahams: Ian Abrahams (Moose) @BroadcastMoose Reports today Chelsea & Man City are eyeing up a summer move for @Boro captain @bengibson1993 https://t.co/UIjRvcKQyK 3/7/2017, 8:48:29 AM The former England under-21 international is also able to operate as a left-back, another reason why he would be attractive to Arsenal as he could provide competition for Nacho Monreal. Given that Mertesacker is unlikely to return to his best any time soon and Gibson is only likely to improve on his 2016-17 form as he gains more experience, the Boro defender could be a fine signing to bolster Arsenal's centre-back ranks. The Gunners may baulk at the potential £30 million price tag, but Gibson could be worth every penny if he becomes a stalwart of the Arsenal defence.
