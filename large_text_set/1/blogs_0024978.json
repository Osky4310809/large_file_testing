Now, as we act in the continuing narrative of Stranger Things, we 1983 Midwesterners will repel bullies,” he added. “We will shelter freaks and outcasts, those who have no home. We will get past the lies. We will hunt monsters. And when we are at a loss amidst the hypocrisy and casual violence of certain individuals and institutions, we will, as per Chief Jim Hopper, punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy what we have envisioned for ourselves and the marginalized. And we will do it all with soul, with heart, and with joy. We thank you for this responsibility!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T05:23:40.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
