Of course, the strike isn't for all women -- it's for an elite cohort of left-leaning special snowflakes.\nAs Kira Davis at Red State noted, it seems to be \"organized by women who have absolutely no understanding of what it is like to live hand-to-mouth every single day.\"\nEven more ridiculous, #DayWithoutWomen wants you to avoid shopping…except at businesses and establishments owned by women and minorities. But aren’t those women supposed to be taking the day off? Who is supposed to be working and who is supposed to be striking? And what if those minority business owners supported Trump? Are we allowed to shop there then?\nThe last such effort (\"A Day Without Immigrants\" strike) resulted in pink slips for more than a few of the unlucky activists who took part in that protest. Heather Dockray, a bespectacled millennial who writes for Mashable , came up with a list of thirteen cutesy girlish excuses for grown women to use on their bosses so maybe the same thing doesn't happen to them.\n\"Women-identified people\" will be \"protesting on behalf of all the marginalized groups currently threatened by the Trump administration,\" Dockray proclaimed (without elaborating on how women have actually been threatened and marginalized by the Trump administration).\nShe also didn't explain how taking a paid or unpaid vacation for one day makes women any less marginalized or threatened by The Donald, but she did say it offered them a \"unique opportunity\" to \"disrupt the flow of capitalism\" and send \"a powerful message of dissent.\"\nWhat's more, \"it'll also allow strikers to send delightfully righteous messages to their coworkers that they'll have no choice but to accept.\"\nIndeed, Dockray was so impressed with her list of excuses, she recommended that the women-identified workers should send the excuses to \"everyone on staff\" so they'll know \"just how historic this moment is and/or just how clever you are.\"\nPrepare to be dazzled, PJ Media readers!\n1. I’ll be out of the office all day Wednesday in solidarity with women worldwide. You should take a screenshot of this email as it's now a piece of history. Thanks!\n2. I will be out of office all day Wednesday fighting for social justice. I'll be returning to the office to fight for the same thing but harder on Thursday, March 9.\n3. I will be out of the office all day Wednesday striking on behalf of women everywhere, because come on now why do you even need a because.\nThis next one seems kind of desperate...\n4. Please forgive any delays in my response time. I'm out of office today at the Women's Strike and will have access to email but have pledged not to check it until I return. Of course, I will very likely check my email because this whole strike thing makes me very nervous but I will maybe not respond to your email until Thursday morning, assuming I don't I freak out first.
