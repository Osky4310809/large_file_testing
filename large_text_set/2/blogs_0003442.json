Then, in another video, Gaga prepped for a pre-Super Bowl press conference with some eye masks and the same aforementioned dryer. \nThe Supersonic Hair Dryer was released by Dyson in 2016 to extremely positive reviews. The incredibly high-tech product is powerful without being heavy and bulky. At $399, it is a serious investment, however, it is considered to be one of the best dryers currently on the market. \nLook ahead to see Gaga glamorously getting ready.
