But Michelle Obama is beautiful in the way that black people know themselves to be. Her prominence as first lady directly attacks a poison that diminishes black girls from the moment they are capable of opening a magazine or turning on a television. \nAnd while we wouldn’t want to do anything like objectifying any woman, or reducing Michelle Obama’s powerful presence in American life to her appearance—especially not in the year she emerged as such a powerful speaker and gave us the all too badly needed slogan “when they go low, we go high”—it’s also worth taking a few moments to acknowledge what Coates is saying here, how Obama’s existence is a rebuke to so much ugliness. \nSeeing 106-year-old Virginia McLaurin’s reaction to seeing not just a black president but “a black wife” drove home some of what it has meant to have the entire Obama family living in the White House. x YouTube Video \nLet’s talk about what she did at her final state dinner: \n… coming less than a week after her magnetic speech in New Hampshire on women and respect, it went far beyond being simply an ambassadorial nod to a guest country’s talent and made a powerful subliminal statement. \nThe dress, after all, was made of rose gold … chain mail. As much as it was gracefully cut and draped, it also spoke of armor and female strength, of the need to gird yourself to fight for what you believe in. She made a garden and she set it in stone . She’s funny. \nThe role of first lady may be badly dated and deeply problematic, but Michelle Obama’s grace, humor, and strength through eight years of unimaginable public pressure and, too many times, in the face of extreme ugliness deserve our recognition and appreciation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T02:14:28.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
