Wayne's having a laugh again (Photo: Rex Features) \nFirstly, Sutton were made to rue his absence as they were forced to play an outfield player in goal. \nNow Shaw - who started his football career as a Southampton trainee alongside Alan Shearer - has bagged himself a ticket to their EFL Cup final showdown against Manchester United. \nHe joined other Saints fans on a coach to Wembley and didn't keep a low profile - joining in on their pie-jinks at the back of the bus. Make sure you check it out on the video at the top of the page. \"Get your pasty out!\" (Photo: Twitter) \nShaw can be seen lapping up fans' chants, with songs such as \"It weren't a pie it was a pasty\", \"Get your pasty out!\" and \"Pasty's gonna get ya!\" getting an airing. \nBrilliantly, the video ends with Shaw getting out a mini pie he's brought along for the journey. Cue the delirious cheers from fans.
