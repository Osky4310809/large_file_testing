It was a challenge from both of them. The foul is Phil Jones. He got the ball but went with the scissors,\" he told Sky Sports . \n\"Sofiane Feghouli's foot was not high in the air, it was not deliberate. It was the key decision and it killed us. It put the game in a different perspective and was totally unfair for us. \n\"Phil made a meal of it, but you cannot blame him. Maybe he made a meal because he is the one who went in dangerously and he is saving himself.\" \nWest Ham were further incensed when Ibrahimovic's goal was allowed to stand despite the Sweden striker having drifted offside. \nBilic stated that he has sympathy with the job the officials have, but was left dumbfounded as to why the flag was not raised. \nHe added: \"It was a big offside for the second goal. When the players are sprinting it is hard for the referees. I am the first to say that. \n\"But the players were walking. They should spot this.\" \nDespite having played the majority of the game with 10 men, West Ham had the chance to take the lead when Michail Antonio went through one-on-one with the score at 0-0 only to be denied by David de Gea and Bilic was disappointed his team were not more clinical. \n\"Ten men against a team like this is very hard, but we had chances. We had to score the goal when we had the chance,\" he said. \n\"That would have lifted us. I am disappointed with the result and frustrated by how we lost it, but I am proud of my players.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:16:21.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
