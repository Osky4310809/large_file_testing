This one, from the group Live Action, purports to show that Planned Parenthood is lying about what they do: if you want an abortion, they're happy to help. But prenatal services? They'll turn you down every time. They have dozens of recorded phone calls to prove it. \nI'm sure you're wondering what the catch is. The answer is: there isn't one. Planned Parenthood is very clear about their mission. Here it is: \nPlanned Parenthood health centers focus on prevention: 80 percent of our patients receive services to prevent unintended pregnancy. \nPage 29 of their 2014-15 annual report breaks this down into the following colorful chart, available to anyone with an internet connection: \nPage 30 provides more detailed data: Prenatal visits accounted for 17,149 \"clinical interactions\" out of a total of 9,455,582. That's 0.18 percent of the total. I've added the blue sliver at the top to illustrate this. \nIn other words, Planned Parenthood doesn't pretend that prenatal care is a big part of what they do. A few of their clinics offer it, but not many. For the most part, they provide contraception, abortions, STD testing, and various screening services. The folks who ran this devastating sting operation could have saved themselves a lot of time by just reading a couple of pages of Planned Parenthood's annual report. Get the scoop, straight from Mother Jones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:43:40.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
