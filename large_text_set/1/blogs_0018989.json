To Make the Coconut Bacon: Lightly spray a non-stick skillet and toast the coconut flakes until nice and golden brown. Add the balance of the ingredients. Mix to coat. Cook for another couple minutes moving it around. Remove from heat, it will get crispier as it sets. To Make the ‘Egg’ Patties: Blend or mix together. Lightly spray a non-stick skillet. Place four mason jar rounds or preferred shape (like a metal cookie cutter) down that have been generously greased first. Divide the batter between the rounds, filling about 1/2-3/4 way full, as they will grow as they cook. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until bubbles form throughout and the backside is golden. Flip cook for another 3-5 minutes or until golden and fluffy. To Assemble: Slice your bun in half. Spread the cashew cheese sauce on both sides. Place an “egg” patty inside. Cover with more cheese. Top with crispy coconut bacon, opt for even more cheese, and serve.
