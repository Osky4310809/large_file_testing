Referencing the shade Yeezy sent Drake and DJ Khaled in concert, Drake said the following : \n\"I think everybody has their own little things going on, I’m not really sure what he’s referring to half the time, cos in the same breath, I went from being… like working on a project with him, to him sorta publicly shitting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much. But yeah I’m not really sure, everybody’s got their own thing going on. Again me when I hear that, I just distance myself from it you know, alright if that’s what it is I don’t really even understand the point you’re trying to make but whatever it is that you’re going through, I accept it, I don’t respect it at all. You know cos I feel like me and Khaled are just good people, I’m not sure why we’re the target of your choice that you made that night.\" \nWhat do y'all think? Should Drake let the whole thing go? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:27:19.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
