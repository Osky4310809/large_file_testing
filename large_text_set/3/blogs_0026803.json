Until a model, dressed in what looked like a cake for unicorns, stepped onto the ramp, and into my heart. It was in that moment that I fully understood the less-celebrated power of a pretty-looking dress. \nNow, your definition of what is perceivably pretty may differ from mine, but however you build that adjective up in your head, the feeling that a flawlessly constructed dress leaves you with is universal. For some, this rush could come from a flouncy hem or a defining waistline. In fact, I have had some personal experience with girls losing all sense of rationality around a palette of pastels. \nAnd then there are those who love their wardrobes replete with figure-hugging numbers. Contrary to this Kim K-loving league, are the ones who’d almost never see beyond floating dresses on retail racks. What I am leaning toward is the fact that all these dresses are as valid as the choice of the wearers. In this light, we pulled out the prettiest dresses from the fashion week that went by – the blooming brunch styles, the very feminine date-night ones, and the ones that are plain mood-lifters in disguised fabric. Take your pick. 1.This embroidered sum of fluff, sheer, and florals by Heumn. 2.This tiered maxi by pero that is a total whiteout of all our collective sorrows. 3.This scoop-neck metallic number that is designer Malini Ramani’s gift to the female population. 4.This aubergine belted dress that has Amit Aggarwal written all over it. 5.This Hemant and Nandita lace-up floral halter that is a masterclass in fall layering. 6.This funky off-the-shoulder number by Pankaj and Nidhi that is a must-have. 7.This waist-skimming beauty by Siddharth Tytler that indulges in a little play of peek-a-boo. 8.This boho dress by Pallavi Singhee that inspires us to reclaim navel-grazing necklines. 9.This Indigo structural beauty by Sahil Kochhar that finds it own through asymmetry and gravity-defying sleeves. 10.This layered white languid dress by Ka.sha that pairs well with a badass jacket. 11.This monochrome dress by Vineet Bahl that also high-fives the big-belts trend. 12.This off-the-shoulder pleated maxi by Anupama Dayal that has its long sleeves in the right place. 13.This kaftan-inspired dress by Shivan and Narresh that is gorgeous-looking with its metallic details. 14.This ivory ruffled halter dress by Nikasha that could be whisked to one of your exotic travels. 15.This poly crepe dress by Wendell Rodricks that comes undone while walking (but still manages to stay in place, you guys!)
