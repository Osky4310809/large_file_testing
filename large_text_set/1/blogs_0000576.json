(Amanda Edwards/Invision/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Thursday, January 5, 2017, 7:16 PM \nA day before their side-by-side burial in the Hollywood Hills, Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds were remembered at a star-studded memorial Thursday inside the gated compound they shared. \nAbout 200 mourners, including actress Meryl Streep, gathered to honor the mother-daughter duo who forged a singular bond in life and died a day apart last month, a source at the service told the Daily News. \nStreep, who starred in Fisher’s semi-autobiographical “Postcards from the Edge,” spoke earlier in the day at a Walk of Fame ceremony for actress Viola Davis but “obviously” wasn’t going to miss the gathering, the source said. \n“People are heartbroken,” Reynolds’ son Todd Fisher told The News by phone as he greeted guests. \nBroadway to dim lights in honor of Debbie Reynolds, Carrie Fisher \nActress Ellen Barkin and actor Ed Begley Jr. were among those spotted entering the property. \nDespite the somber occasion, the brother and son said his family’s spirits were lifted Thursday by the news that Broadway theaters planned to dim their lights Friday night in memory of his sister and mom. \n“We have goosebumps from hearing about that,” he said. \n“My family has great memories of living in New York and my mother performing ‘Irene,’ ” he said, referring to the 1973 musical that earned Reynolds a Tony Award nomination and marked his sister’s stage debut. Mourners arrive at private memorial service for Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds \nReynolds died Dec. 28 at 84 from a suspected stroke. Fisher, 60, suffered cardiac arrest on a transatlantic flight Dec. 23 and spent four days in a Los Angeles hospital before her Dec. 27 death. \nThe “Star Wars” actress and best-selling author was cremated, in accordance with her wishes, and will be laid to rest at Forest Lawn Memorial Park on Friday, Todd said. \n“They’re going to be buried together tomorrow,” he said. “They’ll be in the same sarcophagus.” \nHe said he hadn’t yet seen the exact placements for the remains, but the family monument will resemble the one where actress Bette Davis was laid to rest on the same property in 1989. \nCarrie Fisher's family thankful for good Samaritans on flight \nReynolds and Davis were co-stars in the 1956 movie “The Catered Affair.” Davis also lived in Fisher’s house years before she bought it. \nTodd Fisher previously told The News his mom disliked formal funerals, so “we’re just getting together and having a party.” \nHe said a much larger joint memorial service — likely in a large hall at Forest Lawn with an outdoor area for fans — will be held soon but is not scheduled. “People are heartbroken,” Reynolds’ son Todd Fisher told The News. (Steve Granitz/WireImage) \nThe devoted son was at his mom’s side on Dec. 28 when the “Singin’ in the Rain” actress fell ill and was rushed to a nearby hospital, a 911 recording released Thursday confirmed. \n“Her son is in there with her. I’m in the kitchen,” an unidentified man told a 911 dispatcher in the highly redacted call the Los Angeles Fire Department released. \nThe man was asked whether Reynolds was awake and breathing, but his answers were removed due to patient privacy rules. \nTodd Fisher said his mother had prior stroke issues, and grief and stress “likely triggered” another stroke while they were meeting to discuss his sister’s arrangements. \nHe said the last thing his mom told him was that she missed Fisher. \n“My mom is with my sister,” he told The News just hours after Reynolds’ death. “She wanted to be with her. She always took care of her.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:28:24.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
