They are stripped of their labels but, with a little investigating, the staff was able to identify the familiar sauce bottles. “We measured it and we looked online and we compared and determined it’s an A.1. bottle,” says Ralston. “They’re dishwasher cleaned out but you can still catch a hint of A.1. in them.”\nThe bottles were found in the adult fiction or non-fiction sections—never in the children’s book sections—every few days and the prankster has an M.O. “For the most part, they’re hidden behind the books laying down on their side at the end of the row with the cap showing,” she says.\nFrom Coinage: Try This Healthy, Cheap Late-Night Snack \n\nFor more breaking food news, follow People Food on Facebook . \nWhile the bizarre mystery, first reported by The Chronicle Telegram , sounds straight out of a John Green novel (Margo, is that you?!), Ralston says a teen culprit can be ruled out. “We do think they’re being left during the first half of the day because we seem to find them after 3 o’clock. So we don’t think it’s a student. That much we kind of surmised,” she says. Local police have even gotten involved to no avail. “Nobody knows anything. We’re stumped.”\n“We’ve tried to think of different things,” Ralston continues. “Is it a game that somebody is playing but we just don’t know how to play it?”\nA representative for Kraft has yet to respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment—or any possible leads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:20:28.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
