It’s called the Cookie Butter Bar, and Starbucks claims it’s the perfect treat for “cookie purists.” It’s made with Speculoos cookies, crunchy cookie butter , and vanilla cream cheese icing. They may not be the most aesthetically beautiful snacks Starbucks has created (they actually look quite plain), but they might be the tastiest things Starbucks fans have ever eaten.\nThe New Starbucks Cookie Butter Bar Will Give You Life https://t.co/I1JApSSVx6 pic.twitter.com/QY0LrddAKa \n— News Cult (@News_Cult) March 7, 2017 The Cookie Butter Bar was released a few weeks ago without any hoopla or even an announcement. The gingerbread flavor of the Speculoos cookie paired with the vanilla icing is making people go wild. Here’s what they have to say about Starbucks’s newest treat.\nOkay shoutout to @Starbucks for this new cookie butter bar omgggg \n— Lisa Higgins (@LisaChristine13) March 6, 2017 the cookie butter bar from Starbucks is so bomb \n— sirenita (@irenealee) March 3, 2017 If you haven't had the cookie butter cheesecake bar from Starbucks I suggest you go do that\n— D'onna (@Deeeonna) March 1, 2017 I have experienced no food gasm quite like the one from this new cookie butter bar at starbucks. this is serious guys\n— Alix Lynx (@thealixlynx) March 5, 2017 This is serious, indeed. The Cookie Butter Bar is only $2.75, yet it seems to produce a level of happiness no money can buy. Apparently, the key to enjoying a Cookie Butter Bar is eating it when it’s cold, so don’t waste any time to chomp into it after the barista hands it over.\nStarbucks has been stepping up their game lately when it comes to snacks and secret drinks , so we can’t say we’re surprised the Cookie Butter Bar is such a big hit. It’s basically a crunchy cookie pie converted into an on-the-go bar. What could possibly go wrong? All we can think about now are the drinks that will arise out of the Cookie Butter Bar concept. Maybe a Cookie Butter latte? A Cookie Butter Frap? We have faith in you, Starbucks.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:35:42.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
