However, in-store holiday sales grew by only 1.4% from a year ago, little better than 2015’s anemic 1.2% rate and much weaker than the postrecession average. \nPut together, total holiday sales rose by 3.4% from a year ago, better than 2015’s 2.7% rise. But sales didn’t come close to matching the 4.8% growth logged in 2014. There are some indications that consumers are now starting their holiday shopping in October. If the season is defined to include October, then 2016 sales grew by 3.6%.

The sentiment improvement is continuing, indicating that shoppers’ optimism will last a while. But this may translate into fewer sales than would normally be expected. Growth in motor-vehicle and restaurant sales is expected to cool after posting red-hot numbers over the past several years. And surging online sales may be countered by slower sales gains at malls because of department store closures this year. Including gasoline, total sales growth will definitely show a pickup over last year, since gas prices have already risen by about 20 cents per gallon in the past month.

Otherwise, any such spending boost will be pushed back to 2018. \nRetail sales overall — which include everything from autos and gasoline to restaurant meals, construction materials and garden supplies — picked up strongly in December on a 4.5% year-over-year surge in motor-vehicle sales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:05:06.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
