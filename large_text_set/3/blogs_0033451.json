So we still need some time before the game is ready.\" \nBadowski again: \"It's a new title for us, and it will accompany us for years, so it takes effort to prepare it properly.\" \nAnd back to Kiciński: \"The work is ongoing, and it's very intense. So it's not a comfortable situation because we know what it's like, we watch the game, but we can't tell you anything. This year belongs to Gwent. This year we'll be communicating Gwent.\" \nThat \"accompany us for years\" line seems to indicate more from Cyberpunk 2077 than a single game, but who knows if Badowski was referring to DLC or plans for sequels down the road. Either way, it doesn't sound like Cyberpunk 2077 will be a one-and-done game for CD Projekt. \nKiciński also talked briefly about CD Projekt Red planning to develop another game concurrently with Cyberpunk 2077, but offered no further details about what that game might be. Cyberpunk 2077 currently has around 300 developers working on it, and \"The team will be growing, because Gwent will be serviced, Cyber will be developed, plus one more game,\" he said. \"We already have [300 people on Cyberpunk 2077], at the very end it will probably be more, maybe 400 people.\" \nWhen someone in the audience asked about CD Projekt recently hiring concept artists who would typically work on the beginning of a project, Badowski explained that those hires weren't specifically for Cyberpunk. \"There are two processes. One, we are building teams. The Cyberpunk team is already complete. We are developing the studio. That is why we have these [job] items on our website, because quite often there are certain opportunity hires. We're looking for top talent on the market. That's why we're looking for concept artists. It's really hard to find the most talented concept artists, and we try to keep extending the team.\" \nAnd that's everything they had to say about Cyberpunk 2077. Judging by CD Projekt's focus on Gwent, we don't expect to hear substantially more about their next RPG until Gwent is in full release later this year. Fingers crossed for more details before the holidays. Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:19:55.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
