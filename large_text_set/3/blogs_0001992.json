Partly true.\nYou can’t control 100% about what happens in your life, but you can choose how to live with them. This is what differentiates successful people from unsuccessful ones.\nThis seems to be easier said than done. Indeed we need some concrete ways to do so. Below are 5 tips to help you focus on yourself and have a more fulfilling life.\n1. Measure what you can control, don’t obsess over what you can’t. When working towards a difficult goal, it’s easy to fall short of the targets you set for yourself. That’s because you’re setting the wrong targets. You might be thinking, “I should have a new job in two weeks’ time,” when a more helpful goal would be, “I should send out 10 job applications this week.” By measuring what you can control, rather than what you can’t, you’ll feel more empowered.\nThe act of measuring something turns a scary unknown into something real and quantifiable [1] . Instead of feeling lost and confused about why you’re not achieving your goals, you can consult your measurements and see where you might be falling short.\n2. Stop blaming others for your problems. Life owes you nothing. It’s a harsh truth, but accepting it will give you the motivation to create the life you really want, without expecting it to be handed to you [2] .\nNext time you find yourself thinking, “Life is so unfair,” stop. Ditch the victim mentality, and focus instead on actions you can take to change your situation. If you’re unhappy with your weight, take the first step and sign up to a gym. If you hate your job, start sending out applications. It’s down to you to create the life you want.\n3. Be proactive, not reactive. Do you go through life only taking action when you really need to? You’re not alone, as most of us behave in a reactive way, even though it doesn’t help us. There’s a theory that explains the four stages of motivation, and the higher you are, the more successful you’ll be [3] .\n1. You’re motivated by fear. You act only to avoid punishment or negative consequences.\n2. You’re motivated by reward. You take action when there’s something you’ll get in return.\n3. You’re motivated by duty. Fear and reward no longer play a part in your decisions to act, and you’re on the way to success.\n4. You’re motivated by love. You aim to bring as much happiness to the world as possible, and you no longer worry about your own needs. This is the level you’re aiming for.\nNext time you catch yourself being motivated by fear, or by the desire for a reward, stop and think about your true motivations. What do you really want to achieve? Once you’ve worked that out, you’ll be ready to take proactive action to get there.\n4. Stop comparing yourself to others. Comparing yourself to others is one of the easiest ways to damage your self-esteem [4] . No matter what you achieve, you’ll always find someone who has done more or done it better. This behaviour is completely self-defeating, and won’t help you achieve anything. Focus on achieving your personal goals, rather than basing your self-worth on external factors.\n5. Be your own biggest supporter. While support from others is great, the only person you can truly count on is yourself. When working to create the life you want, you might find that friends and family cast doubts on your plans. Remember that nobody knows you better than you know yourself, and work on becoming your own biggest supporter.\nChanging your mindset truly can change your life. Stop blaming your problems on external factors, and start taking control of your actions.\nReference [1] ^ James Clear: The Evolution of Anxiety: Why We Worry and What to Do About It [2] ^ Thought Catalogue: Hate To Break It To You But You Are The Reason Your Life Sucks So Much [3] ^ Medium: How to Become the Best in the World at What You Do [4] ^ Medium: Embracing These Brutal Truths About Success Will Immediately Improve Your Life The post To Have Better Control Of Your Life, Remember To Focus On Your Own appeared first on Lifehack .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:12:12.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
