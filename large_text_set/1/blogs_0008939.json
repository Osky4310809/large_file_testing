There are a number of ways of doing that, but one of the most popular at the start of the new year involves tracking stocks that professionals have kept watch over. The following stocks are among those that industry professionals are looking at closely in the new year. While no one can say whether they will turn out to be good investments in the long term, they are nonetheless drawing attention for the time being and may be useful additions to certain portfolios. Johnson & Johnson \nJohnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) is not a new company. Far from it, in fact, but this stock is doing surprisingly well into the beginning of 2017 and may continue its upward trend for some time to come. By the end of 2016 it saw its stock prices up nearly 13% for the year, although it peaked even higher than that previously in 2016. Sporting a forward EPS of 7.14, the price to earnings ratio for JNJ seems to be such that it remains a profitable investment. Indeed, dividend investors across the country find a spot for JNJ in a variety of portfolio types. With a strong brand name and evergreen products in a number of different consumer staples areas, it is a good bet that JNJ is not going anywhere anytime soon. Procter & Gamble \nLike JNJ, Procter & Gamble ( PG ) is not a new stock to enter the market. But that doesn't mean that it can't be a worthwhile investment at this point. The company has undergone major shifts in recent years, including dropping Duracell as a portion of its business and appointing a new CEO in 2015 . Nonetheless, PG consists of brands that are such stalwarts in the American marketplace that its future seems certain. Procter & Gamble brands include Pampers, Luvs, Mr. Clean, Crest, Dawn, Tampax, and more. Diageo \nDiageo ( DEO ), the parent company of such liquor brands as Smirnoff, Ciroc, Johnnie Walker, Baileys, Guinness, and more, may be due to rise in price thanks to record levels of alcohol consumption in many markets around the world. Although its price has not moved in recent months, some analysts feel that it is likely to rise in the year to come. Consolidated Edison \nAnother tried and true staple of the stock market, Consolidated Edison ( ED ) may be poised for growth in the new year. With a monopoly over electricity in New York City, Con Ed does not seem to be going anywhere, and talk of further consolidation may mean even more dominance and stock prices increasing as a result.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T04:12:59.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
