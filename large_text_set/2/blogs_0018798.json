Team and MLBPA sources are telling me baseball has approved a dugout signal for an intentional walk, effective for 2017 season. More coming. \n— Full Dissident (@hbryant42) February 22, 2017 \nThe change would reportedly replace the standard four way outside pitches with a single that comes in from the dugout. That would mean that baseball would eliminate what amounts to wasted time as four lobs are thrown down to the plate to bypass a batter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:46:00.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
