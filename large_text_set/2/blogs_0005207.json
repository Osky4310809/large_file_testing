He told Billboard before his set, ​”I felt like [the title] applied. I felt like this was the time. I think [trap is] leading categories as far as genre in music, listeners and streaming. I’m excited to bring that to the forefront. I’m excited to be one of the people that kind of fill that lane.” \nThe former Playaz Circle MC (born Tauheed Epps) announced his upcoming release with a photo of a studio session with one of his frequent collaborators, Drake . Said 2 Chainz: “We working on stuff for his [ More Life ] album and stuff for mine — and it’s dope.” The pair previously worked on 2012’s “No Lie,” 2013’s “All Me” and last year’s Daniel Son; Necklace Don cut “Big Amount.” \nHe adds that keeping their records fresh is a challenge. “It wasn’t easy though. Drake is a perfectionist. I like to rap and I’m a perfectionist, but it was just about getting that record that we felt would hold some kind of substance that we could listen to over time like the previous records that we have. We have some pretty timeless pieces so I think that’s what we’re working on — more timeless pieces.” \nDespite the football festivities invading the city, 2 Chainz — who is rooting for the Atlanta Falcons in their Super Bowl LI matchup against the New England Patriots — has a history on the hardwood. Last year, his former Alabama State University college basketball coach, Clayton Harris, even compared his skills to NBA/ABA Hall of Famer George Gervin’s. \n“I didn’t hear it or see it but I do think I got a mean finger roll,” he boasted. Gervin also told Billboard’s Ballin’ Out podcast earlier this year that he was a fan of 2 Chainz’ music, which brought a smile to the rapper’s face. He added, “That’s fresh!” TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:59:38.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
