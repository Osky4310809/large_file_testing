I was 16, and the world was my oyster. \n“So, what do you want to do with your life?” I asked this mysterious boy creature with the amazing punk-rock spiky hair. \nOwen took a long, meaningful drag of his clove cigarette and dreamily gazed into the starry nighttime sky like he was looking into the future. \n“I’m going to do hair ,” he quietly answered, while grey clouds of smoke delicately danced out of his lips. \nThe hairs on my arms stood up. I had the chills . I had never met someone so young and so sure of their life’s purpose. \nLater that year, Owen went to hair school. \nMy friend Ruba and I were his greatest, most willing hair school experiments. \nHe cut my tattered, bleached-out hair into a chic bob. He sewed hair extensions into my scalp when I decided I hated the bob. \nHe gave Ruba a badass fashion mohawk that made her the coolest, most feared 17-year-old girl in town. \nOwen eventually moved to New York City and became a top celebrity stylist, styling the heads of Kate Hudson, St. Vincent, Bjork, Gigi Hadid, Jessica Alba and yours truly. \nI might not be a celebrity, but a hairdresser’s loyalty is far thicker than fame or money, baby. \nAnd in the past 10 years, a lot of stuff in my life has drastically changed. \nMy career changed. My baby skin became cluttered with scars and tattoos . I moved across the world. I had my heart broken . \nI moved back to New York. I had a scary bout of manic depression . My career changed again. I fell in love. I fell out of love. I fell in love again. \nBut the one constant in my life has always been my hair stylist, Owen , tending to my head, snipping off the dead-ends parts of my life with his silver expensive scissors and transforming me into the freshest, most glittery version of myself. \nAnd I think that many women go to the same stylists for their entire lives because we have these wildly intimate connections to our hairstylists. \nThe bond between stylist and client is far deeper than beauty, you know. \nWe trust our hairdressers with every fiber of our beings. It’s one of the most blazingly honest and sacred relationships we’ll ever have in our lives. “The bond between stylist and client is deeper than beauty. ” \nWhen my mother moved to Florida from New York City, she flew every six weeks to New York to have her hair done by the legendary colorist Louis Licari , who had been transforming her mouse brown hair into the perfect shade of honey blonde for two decades. \nI recently met a girl who lives in New York City, and when I asked her what stylist was responsible for her awesome ash-colored hair, she told me she gets her hair done in Nebraska . \nMeaning, she hops on an airplane every few weeks, flies far away from glamorous Manhattan and trudges to Nebraska to get her hair done. \nI get it. I would follow Owen to Mars. \nNot only do we emotionally latch on to the people who make us look and feel beautiful, but there are also some very specific secrets only our hairdressers know about us. \nAnd deep, embarrassing, gross, intimate secrets are the foundation of unbreakably strong bonds, babe. 1. They know about the (shhh) grey hairs that have been springing out of your head since you turned 26. \nKnow one else knows that grey little sprouts of hair have been popping out of your head since you turned 26, except your trusty stylist, who lovingly paints those silvery strands with the finest hair color in all of Beverly Hills. \nBest part: They don’t dare ever mention it. Giphy \nThe onset of grey hairs is a wildly vulnerable issue for some of us. For me, they’ve been my first sign of aging, and I feel physically sick when I spot one taunting me in the bathroom mirror. \n(Disclaimer: I love women who embrace their silver hair, and I think it’s actually chic AF. But, I’m not one of those women, babes.) \nAnd my hairstylist knows this. \nSo without any discussion, he lovingly paints over them and pretends he didn’t even notice them himself. \nIt’s a secret we’ll both take to the grave (and I’ll shamelessly post about on the internet, but the internet isn’t, like, the real world ). 2. They know how you really get all that epic VOLUME. \n“Wow, Zara, your hair looks fantastic!” a bitchy PR girl clad in a leopard-print coat, clutching a cold glass of Champagne, purred to me at an event last week. \n“Thanks,” I purred back. I met her hungry eyes. \n“I’m taking supplements,” I whispered into her ear, before strutting away in my heels. \nAnd yes, I’m taking supplements. We’re all taking supplements. It’s 2017, so who isn’t hopped up on Vitamin B capsules? \nSupplements might help encourage an increase in your overall hair health, but let’s get real: No amount of biotin is going to take you from having a thin little bob to a glittering sea of waist-length, Giselle-like hair. \nBut you know what will? Extensions, honey. Extensions that your stylist discretely either tapes, bonds or sews into the roots of your tender head. \nBut my stylist won’t ever utter a word about the pounds of Virgin Remy hair he tapes into my hair. He won’t even let out a sheepish smile if he overhears me talking about how amazing my “supplements” are. \nHe’ll proudly run his fingers into my fake head of hair as if that hair is all mine, babe. \nAnd thanks to my stylist, I sort of believe I was born with that lush mane, too. 3. They know you’re terribly prone to dandruff. \nNot only do they know about your winter time dandruff issue (and give you the proper medical treatment), but they also know about the strange mole on the left side of your skull. \nThey know the real reason you have bangs is to hide your forehead wrinkles because you can’t afford botox . Giphy \nThey know when you’re stressed the fuck out because of the clumps of hair that fall out of your head and clog up the drain when you’re getting a professional wash. \nThey might even give you a recommendation for a therapist! If only to get your hair back on track, you know? \nHealthy hair, healthy mind: that’s my motto. \nMy stylist knows more of my gross secrets than my gynecologist. And my vagina has lived hard, sister. (Just not as hard as my hair.) “My stylist knows more of my gross secrets than my gynecologist.” 4. They know you only wash your hair twice a week. \nYour friends : “I don’t know how those girls wash their hair twice a week! How disgusting! Especially when they WORK OUT like we do.” \nYou: I know, it’s horrendous. I wash my hair every single day. \nYour hairstylist: You’ve only been washing your hair twice a week, huh? \nYou: Yes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:41:26.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
