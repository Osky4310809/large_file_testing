This is one of the most indelible lines from one of the 1980s’ best actioners. 3/5 Navigating the Core—Twister Not many actors are asked to drive a speeding truck through the core of a storm while dodging flying cows. Bill Paxton did it. This means immortality. 4/5 Spits Out His Gum—Apollo 13 “…Thanks.” Paxton says four words in this tiny suit-up scene, and man, he’s great in it. His eyes look alert and anxious. His jaw looks ready. His eyebrows cock and his mouth moves from surprise to small smile to set determination in seconds. It’s such a wonderful acting moment. It’s the perfect case-in-point for Paxton’s excellence. 5/5 Kentucky—Edge of Tomorrow As the profane, no-nonsense Master Sergeant Farell, Paxton dished out orders with lyrical dexterity. His intro with Tom Cruise here is note-perfect, and a fitting summation of his wider film career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:30:32.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
