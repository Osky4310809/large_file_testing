As the name suggests, the SLC RedArt Edition comes with plenty of red highlights on both the exterior and interior. \nOn all models, save for the SLC 43, there is a red front splitter, diamond radiator grille with pins in red and black, red fins in the wings with an exclusive Edition badge beneath it, and red trim for the diffuser. The SLC 43 RedArt Edition sees red highlights on its AMG front and rear bumpers. \nThose who opt for the SLC 43 RedArt Edtiion will get AMG 10-spoke light-alloy wheels painted in high-gloss black with red rim flange, with the rest receiving 18-inch five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels painted in tremolite metallic with a high-sheen finish. \nIn terms of exterior paint finishes, the RedArt Edition is available in seven colours, with the SLC 43 exclusively being offered in two additional paint finishes – designo selenite grey magno and designo iridium silver magno. \nAs for the interior, black leather upholstery with silver pearl Nappa leather inserts and red contrasting topstitching on the seats come as standard. Other items include carbon-embossed leather with Edition logo embroidery on the seats, and exclusive floor mats. Upon request, two-tone upholstery in Nappa leather and Dinamica microfibre is also available. \nMoving on, the SL designo Edition comes with a metallic blue paint finish on the exterior, paired with 19- or 20-inch AMG 10-spoke forged wheels. Chrome highlights are also part of the look, seen on the front apron, along with the designo Edition logo positioned within the car’s side badges. \nInside, the car features porcelain/black designo Nappa leather upholstery on the seats, door panels and steering wheel. This is accompanied by a porcelain designo Dinamica roof liner, white seat belts, designo trim element in piano lacquer champagne white as well as the specific floor mats.
