At the very least, in Jet Black similar to the company’s iPhone 7. While the Cupertino company hasn’t announced any plans to release AirPods in new colors, an aftermarket company is taking the initiative.\nColorWare this week began offering customized AirPods, which can be ordered in 58 different colors. You can even paint your left AirPod one color and your right AirPod another.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com Unfortunately, as with a lot of ColorWare customizations, the service isn’t cheap. On top of the $159 you’ll pay for AirPods, ColorWare is tacking on another $130, bringing the total price to $289. That’s a lot for headphones you’ll probably lose. (But, don’t worry, Apple has a “Find My AirPods” feature on the way.)\nThe different colors look amazing Although the service is expensive, ColorWare does amazing work, and the AirPods do look pretty cool when they aren’t the plain white. You can also customize the AirPods’ case, which will add another $30 to your total bill.\nIf you do customize your AirPods, they should ship out in about six weeks. I don’t know about you, but I think the AirPods in matte black look pretty cool.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:07:59.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
