It's managed, somehow, to soak into every crevice of the American market in the past five years. Thank Georgia O'Keeffe for Your Love of Cacti, Plaster, and Terra Cotta by Meghan Murray \nLike any good trend piece, Schwartzberg’s article tells us how far we’ve come, with a nod towards where we're going. And as far as trends go, this one’s pretty stubborn. Millennial Pink is everywhere, as Schwartzberg details: on sofas and couches, toasters and toast spreads, coiffed hairstyles. It's a color that represents the gestalt of our moment. For one, pink is agender now, detached from archaic notions of femininity that may make puffy-chested men who posture as “masculine” bristle. \nSchwartzberg also, rather astutely, points out that there’s a marked difference between this shade and those that are anointed Colors of the Year by the ultimate color gatekeepers, Pantone . The colors marked as trends by Pantone don't usually tend to have the lasting imprint on our cultural consciousness the way Millennial Pink has. When they declared Rose Quartz to be the color of 2016, perhaps they were onto something.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:47:46.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
