By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published:  43 PM India vs Australia: Steve O Keefe picked 6 wickets in both innings helping his side to a 333 run win. (Source: Reuters) \nIndia vs Australia: Two days ago, not too many people in India had heard Steve O’Keefe’s name but after the 1st Test match between India and Australia at the Maharashtra Cricket Stadium in Pune, it will impossible not to remember him every time India’s performance is discussed. The slow left-arm spinner from New South Wales who was labelled as a T20 specialist at one stage of his career, ran a riot in Pune picking up 6 wickets in both the innings helping Australia to a massive 333 run win. He finished the match with the figures of 70/12 and looked delighted after his side’s victory. \n“It’s a good feeling. The first innings was a bit of a blur. For myself, the ball tended to skid on more than spin and it exposed the stumps. We know how hard it is to win over here but we still have to do a bit of work if we have to win the series. I’ll remember the Hill End forever now.” He also called Pune a ‘sundar’ (beautiful) city. \nHaving made his Test debut against Pakistan in 2014, O’Keefe had managed to play just 4 Tests before taking the field against India on Thursday. He was selected for the Sri Lanka tour last year but had to return home due to an injury. Actually, injuries have unfortunately, played an important part in O’Keefe’s career keeping him out of the Australian side for long periods. \nYou may also want to watch: \nO’Keefe, who is yet to make his ODI debut for Aussies, gives credit to former Indian international, Sridharan Sriram who is a part of Australia’s coaching staff, for his performance. “I think Sri is an excellent spin bowling coach. I’ve worked with him a couple of times now and he’s really impressive. He gets it, he understands how to bowl in these conditions, he understands what the batters are thinking,” he said. \nNot too many people would know that O’Keefe has been a part of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the fourth edition of the IPL and was later even selected by Royal Challengers Bangalore. However, he didn’t get a game to play due to the presence of too many stars and has failed to get an IPL contract this year.
