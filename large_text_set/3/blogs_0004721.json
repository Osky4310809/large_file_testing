In his very long, mostly incoherent speech to Congress Tuesday night, he made sure to hit on some of the minority groups who are sure to experience increased marginalization during his presidency—women, blacks, and Latinos (though there are certainly others). But of course, Trump doesn’t really have a plan to increase quality of life for these groups. Especially not while he continues to see them as one-dimensional stereotypes to use as pawns against each other. \nFor example, he had this to say about poverty: Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. \nThis is Denisha. Denisha Merriweather was a guest at the State of the Union to make Trump’s point about the benefits of school choice \nDenisha’s story is important and remarkable. And, clearly, she is a representation of what can happen when opportunity is afforded to young people who are bright and born into improverished backgrounds. But using Denisha as the representation of the “cycle of poverty” only serves to reinforce age-old stereotypes about the face of poverty being a black one. It also reeks of hypocrisy—Betsy DeVos and the rich anti-public school gang don’t really care about Denisha and people like her having educational choices so much as they care about the money-making opportunities in private education. \nTrump then went on to talk about the victims of crime—specifically those who are the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE --- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis. \nThis Jamiel Shaw. \nAnd these are Jenna (left) and Susan Oliver. \nIt’s tragic to lose a loved one unexpectedly and its downright horrific when that loss comes in the form of a crime. And immigration is a hot-button issue that deserves serious conversation. But did you notice that Trump made his point against illegal immigration by using three people of color? This may seem fairly innocuous but the reality is far from it. Trump already made his association to undocumented immigrants as Mexicans, which he did in his campaign announcement in 2015. But the reality is that more Mexicans are currently leaving the U.S. than entering it. And even though we also know that while Mexicans have made up 52 percent of undocumented immigrants in the past, there is also a significant amount of undocumented immigrants from Asia, Central America, and sub-saharan Africa. \nBut, really, the numbers are irrelevant to Trump and friends. What they want is for you to associate illegal immigration with brown folks—specifically Latinos. And by showing off Jamiel, Susan, and Jenna they are also trying to pit black Americans against brown ones. They have little in their platform that appeals to the majority of black people so they keep touting their “hard on inner-city crime” narrative in the hopes that something will stick. Except not all black people live in inner cities. And while it’s true that black people want our community to do better, many of us see issues such as jobs, education, access to the vote, and economic opportunity as the keys to getting there. And those of us who have done our homework already know that Trump’s administration has no real intention of improving our access to any of those things. \nDivide and conquer has always been a strategy of white supremacy, along with parading one or two people of color who support you so you can say “See, I’m not a racist, I have black/brown friends!” Let’s not be fooled by Trump’s transparent attempts to use stereotypes and people’s tragic experiences to justify his divisive policies and continued bigotry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:30:20.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
