Instead, critics argue the policy is an attack on free speech. Dr. Joanna Williams, an academic freedom advocate and lecturer at the University of Kent, said the ban is an “insulting” attempt to control students’ communications. \n“The idea that in a university people need to be dictated to in this way is really insulting to students and academics, we should be able to cope with words,” she told The Independent. “These words have evolved over a long period of time and they don’t have sexist associations.” \nThe university, of course, sees it differently. In a statement on the new policy, a spokesperson said the university is “committed to providing an environment where everyone is valued and treated with dignity and respect.” \n“The Code of Practice on Using Inclusive Language sets out a broad approach to promoting fairness and equality through raising awareness about the effects of potentially discriminatory vocabulary,” the spokesperson said. \nIn December, Oxford University instructed students to refer to each other with the gender-neutral term “ze” instead of “he” or “she.” The rule is intended to keep transgender students from being offended by the use of “unpreferred” pronouns. \n“This issue isn’t about being [politically correct],” Peter Tatchell, a human rights campaigner and LGBT activist, told the U.K.’s Times . “It’s about respecting people’s right to define themselves as neither male nor female.” \nCambridge University, the Times reported, is moving in the same direction. \nThe University of Tennessee in Knoxville faced intense scrutiny in 2015 when it introduced the terms “ze” and “xe” into its campus lexicon. The proposal was ultimately walked back after conservative lawmakers condemned the policy as “political correctness run amok,” according to Inside Higher Ed . \nHowever, the University of Tennessee said it was not mandating students to use the gender-neutral terms by banning the traditional “he” and “she” pronouns — it was just a recommendation. \n“There is no mandate or official policy to use the language,” a university spokesperson said at the time. “Neither the university nor the Office for Diversity and Inclusion has the power or authority to mandate use of gender-inclusive pronouns.” \nSee the full list of words banned at Cardiff below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:13:03.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
