The Warriors will sign forward Matt Barnes to an immediate contract, according to ESPN’s Marc Stein and Chris Haynes. \nThis will be for the rest of the season, not just a 10-day contract. Barnes confirmed the news in an interview with The Undefeated’s Marc Spears and on his Instagram page.\nWish I could bring you two with me!!

Coming back to where it all started! #GodIsGood\nWhile it’s still unclear what the details are in Durant’s injury, it’s clear the Warriors want to get help quickly. MRI results are expected to be ready on Wednesday for Durant.\nThat said, while the team is hoping for the best, there is fear among the Warriors that Durant’s injury will be a matter of months not weeks, and that he won’t be able to return for the regular season, according to The Vertical’s Adrian Wojnarowski. \nWarriors and Durant will know full extent of injury after tests on Wednesday, but there's real doubt about a regular season return.\n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) March 1, 2017 One wrinkle that shows the urgency from the Warriors is they will still sign Jose Calderon , only to waive him to make room for Barnes.\nSources tell Haynes and me that the Warriors plan to sign Jose Calderon as they promised but then waive him to make room for Matt Barnes.\n— Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) March 1, 2017 Barnes was waived from the Sacramento Kings in the wake of the DeMarcus Cousins trade. Barnes was not having a great season prior to being waived. His year was filled with off-court distractions , while on the court, he only shot 39 percent from the field and 33 percent from three-point range.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T16:52:51.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
