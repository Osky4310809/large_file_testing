Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFIFA have handed a lifetime ban to a referee after he was ruled to have aided in the manipulation of a World Cup qualifier. \nGhanaian official Joseph Lamptey was found guilty of breaching FIFA's disciplinary code during the game between South Africa and Senegal in November last year. \nCharges against a second Ghanaian match official, David Lionheart Nii Lartey Laryea, were dropped following an investigation. \nThe match in question — which featured Premier League quartet Sadio Mane, Cheikhou Kouyate, Mame Biram Diouf and Idrissa Gana Gueye — finished 2-1 to South Africa, who were awarded a penalty just before half time. \nFIFA said in a statement: \"The FIFA disciplinary committee has decided to ban the Ghanaian match official Joseph Odartei Lamptey from taking part in any kind of football-related activity (administrative, sports or any other) at national and international level for life. Sadio Mane in action during the game (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \n\"The official was found guilty of breaching art. 69 par. 1 (unlawfully influencing match results) of the FIFA disciplinary code during the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia qualifying match between South Africa and Senegal on 12 November 2016. \n\"Further information concerning the South Africa v. Senegal match in question will be provided once the decision becomes final and binding. \n\"FIFA follows a zero-tolerance policy on match manipulation and is committed to protecting the integrity of football. As a result, FIFA will continue with its ongoing efforts to combat match manipulation through a variety of initiatives, which include the monitoring of international betting and a confidential reporting system with a dedicated integrity hotline and e-mail address.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:11:32.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
