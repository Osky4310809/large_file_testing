A new smartphone brand is coming, founded by creator of the Android operating system, Andy Rubin. \nRubin will serve as Chief Executive Officer of a new consumer hardware company called Essential. Armed with a 40-man team from Apple and Google, the company aims to manufacture products for the mobile and smart home markets. \nThe company’s main focus is the release of a brand new flagship smartphone with no bezels. The phone, still a prototype, aims to shake the flagship smartphone market where the Apple iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S7 and Google’s Pixel reign supreme. Built with metal edges and a ceramic back, the phone is said to be able to add new hardware features over time. \nThe prototype boasts a screen larger than the 5.5-inches on the Google Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus, which can also detect the amount of pressure you use when you touch the phone. There will also be a proprietary connector that not only charges your phone, but acts as a way to expand the phone’s functionality. This connector enables Essential or third-party manufacturers to add hardware accessories for the smartphone. The first among these accessories from Essential could be a 360-degree spherical camera. \nPrice-wise, the new Essential smartphone could be priced in the higher end spectrum, and aims to be released around the middle of 2017. \nAndy Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005, and remained at its helm until 2013. In that time, he turned Android into the most dominant operating system for smartphone. He formed Google’s robotics unit before leaving the company in 2014 to create Playground Global, a startup incubator that backs artificial intelligence, robotics, and augmented reality projects. \nWhether those skills will show up in the new phone remains to be seen, but one thing's for sure, something's about to shift.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T11:56:54.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
