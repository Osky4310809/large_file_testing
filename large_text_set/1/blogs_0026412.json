And after failing to convince Schalke 04 to sell left back Sead Kolasinac, the Blues are now looking for someone for the right flank instead. — Gianluca Di Marzio (@DiMarzio) 30 January 2017 \nAccording to Sky Italia journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, Chelsea have entered the race for Inter Milan winger Jonathan Biabiany . A surprise interest, he says, which we can all agree with, probably. \nThe 28-year-old winger previously played for Parma during four seasons before moving to Inter in July 2015 for a third time in his career, having defended the Inter shirt in the 2006-07 and the 2010-11 seasons as well. \nAlthough Biabiany has only played three games (two starts) for Inter this season — literally, three, to go along with seventeen 90-minute bench appearances — the report claims that the Blues are eager to bring the Frenchman on a loan until the end of the season. Palermo were reportedly the lone suitors for Biabiany's services before Chelsea entered the scene, possibly to gazump Zamparini or provide a motivating force for them to close the deal. \nChelsea's reasoning to bring a player who has barely played for the Serie A's fourth-best team will certainly raise questions and faster than you could say Pato or Ricardo Quaresma. That said, if the deal is only for a few months to add depth in certain positions (allowing Musonda to go out on loan, for example, and cover for right wing-back, too, if needed), there may not be much harm in such an arrangement.
