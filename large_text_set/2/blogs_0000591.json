And that we can manage our security without writing off citizens of entire countries - even babies - as unsafe to visit our country by virtue of geography or religion,\" she wrote. \nM r Trump's executive order bans citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. Refugee admissions were suspended for 120 days while Syrian refugees were barred indefinitely. \nThe move has not only caused consternation for the nations involved but among other Muslim-majority countries, allies such as Germany and Britain and career State Department officials. UK reaction | Trump’s travel ban \nH ollywood's celebrities have also been using their spotlight to slam the president's ban. \nJolie, 41, has received an honorary Oscar for her humanitarian work. Last year, she visited refugee camps in Lebanon and Greece, meeting with families fleeing war in the Middle East. \nThe actress warned that by \"implying Muslims are less worthy of protection, we fuel extremism abroad.\" Who hates Donald Trump and why? Celebrity critics of the US president \nJ olie's op-ed is the first comment she has made publicly since filing for divorce in September from her husband, actor Brad Pitt . The former couple share three adopted children from Cambodia, Vietnam and Ethiopia, and three biological children, who were born in France and Namibia.
