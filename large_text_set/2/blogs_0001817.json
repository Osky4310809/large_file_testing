Comment Below \nShe is believed to have asked him to leave because of his relationship with 34-year-old Spanish actress Marta Milans. \nLast weekend, Kylie was seen without her engagement ring for the first time in a picture posted on social media by a pal, songwriter Grace Barker. \nAnd it emerged last night she had suspected Sasse had been unfaithful. \nA source said: “Kylie is absolutely devastated, totally heartbroken.” \nThe Aussie singer is said to have been convinced Sasse was “the one” but is now believed to no longer trust him.

Kylie is thought to have had a series of arguments with Sasse before travelling to Paris Fashion Week two weeks ago with her photographer friend Katerina Jebb. \nWhen Kylie returned, she is understood to have asked Sasse to leave the home. \nHe is now said to be living with his parents in Leominster, Herefordshire.

The pair met on the set of US TV show Galavant in summer 2015. They quickly became an item and got engaged just months later when he proposed on holiday.
