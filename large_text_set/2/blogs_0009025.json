Getty 0 14 Feb 2017 10:05:00 It was another profitable week for the Soccerway betting guide, with the team producing a consistent profit, can you afford to miss the next edition? \nEight winning selections in Edition 21 of the Soccerway betting guide ensured another level stakes profit at the advised prices. Thousands of punters are now getting an exclusive, stats-based briefing from the team of experts behind the site and their decision is certainly paying dividends with more well priced picks landing over the weekend. \nThe biggest priced selections came from the Anytime Angles column which once again proved it's value at identifying some of the most potent scorers across the world who are still being priced up at tasty odds. Bafetimbi Gomis bagged a double for Marseille in Ligue 1 and the on-loan Swansea frontman was available at 8/5 (2.60) to score anytime. \nProviding a marginally bigger return though, was Samuel Armenteros of Heracles whose scoring exploits in the Eredivisie made him a great pick at 13/8 (2.63) as his side welcomed Roda JC. While the 2-2 result may not have been the most likely outcome, Armenterous lead a two-goal comeback for his side, netting twice in the closing stages to salvage a point. \nWith winners from the A-League, Championship, La Liga and beyond, the research is certainly paying off when it comes to providing punters with a valuable resource for anyone who likes the statistics to back up their selections.

The latter was a second winner for the Key Stats column, powered by Optaâ€™s Premier League facts, which also recommended a 6/4 (2.50) winner in Arsenal's clash with Hull City. \nWith such a wide variety of angles and matches covered, not to mention several winning accumulators, the Soccerway betting guide has grown in popularity.
