Their hooks are sharper, the production isn’t vintage for the sake of vintage, and the recorded material captures the energy of the band’s eccentric live performances perfectly. That’s exactly what they do once again on their new album, Heavy Roller , due out July 29th via Permanent Records. \nToday, the Los Angeles psych rockers have teased the new album with its catchy lead single, “6,000 Horns”. The track recalls the kinetic unpredictability of Magical Mystery Tour , the raucousness of the Flamin Groovies, and the organized chaos of Captain Beefheart. (Even the Heavy Roller record sleeve screams Safe as Milk vibes). Guitars and organs bounce and dance, while Dylan Sizemore’s vocals drift away to the land of golden power-pop melodies. It’s a track that you think might go one way, but veers another — the loud and soft dynamics arranged for maximum shock and awe, like progressive rock without the heady pretense and overplaying. \nHeavy Roller drops July 29th via Permanent and is available for pre-order on black vinyl and a limited run of 150 on gold. Get on ‘em here on Permanent’s site before they’re gone. The band has also announced a handful of tour dates, with more to be announced soon. \nTour dates: 5/26 Los Angeles, CA – The Resident 6/11 Sonoma, CA – Huichica Festival 6/19 Guerenville, CA – Hickey Fest 6/30 Los Angeles, CA – The Echo 7/29 Los Angeles, CA – The BlindSpot Project 7/30 San Francisco, CA – Milk Bar 8/4 San Diego, CA – Soda Bar 8/16 New York, NY – Baby’s All Right 8/19 Bloomington, IN – Blockhouse 8/20 Chicago, IL – Empty Bottle Artists", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:47:03.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
