Fans got mad at Meek Mill that he wouldn't take a pic with them so they started bumping Drake \"back to back\" . He started roasting them too pic.twitter.com/SJ1zbyhuJu \n— DJ Akademiks (@IamAkademiks) February 24, 2017 \nLater on that evening, his crew walked up on a seemingly homeless man begging for money. Instead of going into great philosophical thought like Kendrick Lamar , Meek decided a dollar would cost him a bit of sweat and he commanded the panhandler to drop and give him ten push-ups if he was to receive his pay. \n“Give me ten pushups, and I’m going to give you $20 right now,” he ordered. “We ain’t giving out no free money.” \nThe man had no problems obliging and even went the extra mile and muscled out 20 push-ups. Meek Mill is a piece of shit man. \nI hope the media get a ahold of this and tear him a new one. pic.twitter.com/DFWet5niJa \n— The Cult of Chidism (@chidzhazenberry) February 25, 2017 \nLike the above tweet alluded to, social media users didn’t find the incident amusing in the slightest bit. Meek mill is an idiot for real . How you gonna make a homeless man do push ups for $20 . \nTF?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:08:57.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
