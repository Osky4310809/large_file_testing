It comes as President Trump has made overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin about working more closely in fighting the Islamic State in Syria. Trump also has hinted he might lift sanctions imposed on Russia for its support of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. \nPutin denies helping the rebels, but people here wonder if Trump's move toward better ties with Russia might be connected to the increased fighting. \n“Let them come to an agreement with their words instead of with their ammunition,” said an exasperated Nadezhda Vladimirovna, whose home was struck last week by artillery. \nBy Monday, fighting had de-escalated, and workers were busy restoring electricity and water supplies that had been cut. The Ukrainian government said 231 tons of food had been shipped into the city from neighboring regions. \nA funeral ceremony is held on Feb. 6, 2017, for Elena Volkova, who was killed during shelling on Feb. 2 in Avdiivka, Ukraine.

Both sides accused each other of provoking the fight. \nAvdiivka is like other settlements in the war-torn Donbass region, a vast rust belt of crumbling factories and poverty. The city, a strategic asset because of its massive coke fuel plant, sits on the front line, where troops on both sides regularly exchange fire. Residents have adjusted to the depressing sound of constant artillery fire in the background — or close to home. \nChildren wave through a bus window to their relatives in Avdiivka, Ukraine, as they wait to be evacuated to Sviatohirsk, a town 88 miles away and far from the conflict front line in eastern Ukraine, on Feb. 5, 2017. (Photo: Evgeniy Maloletka, AP) \nAbout 300 people were evacuated from the city in the past week, but many more had already left on their own. The city’s pre-war population of 35,000 has shrunk by about half, according to various estimates. \nResidents like Vladimirovna, whose house was damaged by shelling, stayed behind because they have nowhere else to go or simply because they refuse to abandon their homes. \n“You leave the house not knowing whether you’ll ever return,” Vladimirovna said, watching her neighbors rebuild her roof. \nDespite international efforts to end the conflict, which the United Nations says has displaced more than 1.5 million people, little progress has been made. The Minsk agreement signed in February 2015 outlines a peace settlement, but both sides regularly violate its cease-fire terms. \n“It’s impossible (for both sides) to come to an agreement,” said Ilya Yevgeniyevich, 30, who came to Avdiivka in 2015 to live with his mother after his two apartments in a neighboring village were destroyed. “This is an endless conflict.” \nWhile residents have become embittered by the sporadic fighting that’s disrupted their lives, the Ukrainian military forces holding the city seem motivated and battle-hardened, if exhausted. \nYevhen Marfyuk, a military anesthesiologist, said Ukraine has a “completely new army” compared to the under-equipped and ill-prepared forces in 2014 who were overwhelmed by the speed and intensity of the separatist revolt.
