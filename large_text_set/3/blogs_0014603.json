Laughter and jazz ushered in the sea of skin colors of the crowds. This was a snapshot of my childhood in Pittsburgh. Granted, the festivals occurred by purposeful design. I was fortunate to have a family who exposed my sister and me to cultures from all around the world without ever having to leave the city. From an early age, our parents encouraged us that we could become anyone and anything that we wanted to be in this city and the world. \nWe were also raised by our congregation members at Baptist Temple Church in Homewood, surrounded by prominent African-American game-changers in the community. We had plenty of role models, both black and non-black. We attended Carlow College Early Learning Center, Sacred Heart Elementary and Winchester Thurston — schools that celebrated difference and culture, on top of demanding the highest quality of academics and morals. My sister and I graduated from high school and matriculated to Spelman College and the University of Chicago, respectively. While we certainly received messages from some blacks to leave Pittsburgh in order to have more opportunity, we didn’t take it to heart. My sister and I successfully completed college and returned home — despite the attractions in Atlanta and Chicago. We are both secondary educators who love this city: our home. \nThen, a month ago, my husband and I entered no more than two steps through the front door of our local favorite restaurant. A white bouncer, who bore a striking resemblance to a less fit Mr. Clean, commanded our “IDs.” After being the only ones in the restaurant who were wrist-banded — and witnessing the bouncer treat a party of white women who entered immediately after us differently — the hairs on the back of our necks stood up. As loyal customers, we had never experienced this before. We talked to the manager, director of operations and owner of the restaurant, and heard wildly varying excuses of why we (two of the three African-Americans in the restaurant), and no one else, had been wrist-banded that night. \nThis example is just a small snapshot of what many people of color encounter on a regular basis. Our experiences with race in America have been and continue to be discredited and dismissed by nonminorities who lack empathy, despite all of the evidence to support our realities. \nRecently I was shopping in a small local grocery store. A salesperson, clad in the store’s trademark Hawaiian shirt, asked three other customers if they needed assistance with their shopping, yet I was the customer in closest proximity to him. What was so different about me? My caramel complexion. Perhaps it was unfathomable to that salesperson that I, too, may want assistance. \nThen, a week later, when we had unseasonably mild weather, I relished in the opportunity to break out my black and highlighter-yellow workout capris and top. As I power-walked around my townhome complex, baffled looks from public works men seared through me. I watched their eyes shift while running calculations of whether I lived in the nice complex or walked over from the less attractive neighborhood nearby. \nI’ve lived in the North Hills for two years now and, up to this point, have not experienced the frequency of such events. I am used to being the “only one” or “one of few” in so many situations that it has become second nature to me. What I am not used to, however, is being treated like I am the only one. \nI haven’t changed. Lord knows my skin color hasn’t. So what has changed? This certainly didn’t happen overnight. I have to wonder if I am hypersensitive to everything under the rhetoric of Donald Trump’s administration. I have to wonder: What does the national climate mean for our city that has been historically segregated? I have to wonder and worry about the future of our city’s social climate. \nReports show that we live in a dichotomous city where we comfortably retreat to our homogenous neighborhoods, communities and social circles. Our city is no anomaly. If Mr. Trump isn’t held accountable for his actions, then why would I, as merely a lowly teacher, expect anything more from our local businesses and citizens? Apparently, accountability is still too controversial in 2017, even in one of America’s most livable cities. The color line continues to be a problem in the 21st century. \nMy grandparents did not re-root their lives and fight for civil rights in order for me to give up easily. My parents did not sacrifice to send my sister and me to the most elite schools in the country in order for us not to employ what we have been taught. Therefore, I am sharing my story because I know I am not the only one with this story. I refuse to be silent and broken down. I refuse to be complacent. I refuse to accept anyone’s alternative fact to the reality of my lived experiences. \nDespite the narrow attitudes and old-school mindsets of this city, I’m not going anywhere. I will not partake in the New Great Migration to move down South. My family is here. My roots are here. My life is here. Instead, I want to be a part of challenging the current structures and working with others to rebuild new ones. I am using my influence and networks to the best of my ability to make this city a more inclusive and equitable place for everyone. Pittsburgh is my home, too, and I’m committed to doing whatever it takes for this to be a more welcoming place for people who look like me. I am optimistic that one day we really will be America’s most livable city for everyone. \nPatrice Alaquiva, a teacher at Winchester Thurston, lives in Ross.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T07:48:24.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
