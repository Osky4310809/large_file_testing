The room was a designated backup venue for the chief executive elections held over the weekend.\nSEE ALSO: In ballots we trust: E-voting, hacking and the 2016 US election\nThe stolen data included names, addresses and identity card numbers of voters, the office said in a statement.\nThe data was encrypted, so it'll be a lot harder — albeit not impossible — for information to be leaked, the South China Morning Post reports.\nHong Kong's privacy commissioner for personal data said in a statement that it had been notified of what happened, and said that it will launch a \"routine probe\" into the issue. Police added that they are treating the case as theft, but no arrests have been made so far.\nThe data breach has drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers and Hong Kong citizens. \"This is unacceptable,\" Charles Mok, a lawmaker representing the city's IT sector , wrote on Facebook . \"There's no reason why the data was stored on computers that could have been stolen; they could have encrypted it on the cloud.\"\nWhile the city has 3.7 million registered voters, only 1,194 votes were eligible to be cast, made up of a pre-selected group of voters.\nA Reddit user pointed this out too, asking: \"Why did they need to store the full register [for the chief executive election] instead of just the list of 1,194 'election' committee members?\"\nThe city's residents also responded with trademark sarcasm:\nComment from discussion Breaking: Hong Kong Government loses computer with data of all registered voters .\nComment from discussion Breaking: Hong Kong Government loses computer with data of all registered voters .\nAdam Lee says: \"Wow, it's true what they say, that WeConnect.\" (WeConnect refers to Carrie Lam's winning campaign slogan.)\n\"Try asking the people at Sai Wan (where Beijing's liaison office with Hong Kong is located), you could probably find it there.\"\nWATCH: The best way to understand encryption is through this tale of love and mystery", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/vc8z14qJ.m3u8", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fstandnewshk%2Fposts%2F1273159312769686%3Fcomment_id%3D1273184516100499&include_parent=false", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_(constituency)", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/d_Fhi_FIyE8Uz8sJyCEm8vE0uHg=/http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fthumbs%2Fvc8z14qJ.jpg", "http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2082566/laptops-containing-37-million-hong-kong-voters-data-stolen", "https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/61snod/breaking_hong_kong_government_loses_computer_with/dfgynng/", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhk.nextmedia%2Fposts%2F10155430819762448%3Fcomment_id%3D10155430856942448&include_parent=false", "https://www.facebook.com/CharlesMokOffice/posts/1342613479139309", "https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/61snod/breaking_hong_kong_government_loses_computer_with/", "https://www.pcpd.org.hk/tc_chi/news_events/media_statements/press_20170327.html", "https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js", "https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/61snod/breaking_hong_kong_government_loses_computer_with/dfha2nc/"], "published": "2017-03-28T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:25:53.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
