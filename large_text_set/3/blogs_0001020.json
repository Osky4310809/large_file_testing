She died later at Hennepin County Medical Center. \nHer husband, Yeveginy Savenok, turned himself into St. Paul police hours later. The couple’s two and four-year-old children were with him. \nRelated : Eden Prairie Man Charged With Murdering Pregnant Wife \nLyuba had an order of protection against him, and a charge of domestic violence. Investigators said she was far from safe. Yeveginy showed up Saturday morning and put his kids in the car. The former college wrestler then tackled his wife as her sister ran for help. \nPolice found the young mom with 12 stab wounds. Doctors delivered her baby by C-section, but they both passed away. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said homicide was the manner of death in both cases. \nOn Feb. 2, Yeveginy Savenok pleaded guilty to two felony counts of second-degree murder. On Thursday, he was sentenced to 787 months in prison where he must serve two-thirds of the sentence before being eligible for supervised release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:22:34.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
