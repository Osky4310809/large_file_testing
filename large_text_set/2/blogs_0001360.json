Included in these documents are over 1,500 reported UFO sightings and information about and proof of various psychic experiments that were performed by the U.S. Military. advertisement - learn more Psychic Experiments If you’ve seen the popular Netflix show Stranger Things , you may recall the experiments run by the Department of Energy. But what you may not know, as many people don’t, is that concepts like this one in films and television shows are often drawn from real life. These experiments may have actually been conducted in real life by the CIA and the Department of Defense. Information about the previously classified Stargate Project was released with these documents, with quite a few referencing it. Many truth seekers have been talking about this program, which was started in the 197os to try to develop psychic abilities among various agents and military personnel and budgeted $20 million, for quite some time. According to one of the declassified documents uploaded to the database on the official CIA website , the Stargate Project at one point consisted of an activity chief, a senior intelligence officer, three operational viewers, an intelligence technician, and a secretary. The sole purpose of this project was to test remote viewing methodologies, and it was run under multiple code names, including Gandola Wish, Grill Flame, Center Lane, Dragoon Absorb, Sun Streak, and Star Gate. What Is Remote Viewing? Remote viewing refers to the ability to see what is happening somewhere other than your current physical location. For example, if I were sitting in my house in Canada and could see what was happening in Iceland, this would be an example of remote viewing, of projecting my consciousness elsewhere without being detected. This ability is possible by using what’s known as extrasensory perception or, more commonly, ESP. The participant consent form for Stargate reminds the participant that the “potential for injury during some training cannot be conclusively ruled out.” advertisement - learn more The declassified documents suggest that CIA officials in charge of Project Stargate believed that they had some success with these amazing extrasensory abilities, though perceived limitations were noted. The files reveal that remote viewing was only to be used to collect information in conjunction with other modalities; any intelligence gained from this practice “should not stand alone.” According to the records, the project proved to be fruitless and the CIA closed it down in 1995. Is Remote Viewing Still Possible? Many people claim to be able to achieve remote viewing, otherwise known as astral projection or out-of-body experiences, through meditation. I for one fully believe in the possibility of this technique. I have had out-of-body experiences before, and, to me at least, it makes sense that if you can separate your consciousness from your mind, with some practice you might be able to send your consciousness elsewhere, too. What do you think? Do you believe in the possibility of remote viewing? Have you tried it before? Please share with us in the comments below!
