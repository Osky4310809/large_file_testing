I have a fenced in yard for my 5 dogs. I heard them barking so I looked and I saw the mailman was across the street, I know he doesnt like when the dogs jump or bark, so I met him outside in my driveway(outside my fence) so he could give me my mail. After he handed me my mail he proceeded to pepper spray my 28lb terrier/beagle mix, all the while smiling while doing so. I yelled at him \"what are you doing?\"over and over with no response. I called the cops, I called the USPS, I called the ASPCA. I was horrified that he could do this to a dog behind a fence, who posed no threat at all, and right in front of my face. Well, the ASPCA came and they made a determination that the pepper spraying was unwarranted and they were charging him with various animal cruelty charges. We went to municipal court where we had the court day changed so the mailman could get a lawyer. A few weeks later I was interviewed by Fios news where I learned that the case was going to federal court. Ok, no problem I thought. Well, this past weekend I saw the ASPCA officer and he told me the case was thrown out because the mailman is a federal employee and immune from prosecution. WHAT???? You're kidding???? I said to him. So my mailman and your mailman could for any reason spray your dog at will. I find this unacceptable and this needs to be changed. Pepper spraying a dog for no reason is cruel. While Tommy was not seriously injured its nonetheless cruel and his intention was to harm my dog. It is not right for someone to be able to harm, or try to harm a precious member of my family. I urge you to sign this petition and bring some justice to Tommy and all the other needless victims. \nhttp://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2016/11/mailman_goes_to_federal_court_over_pepper-spraying.html", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:06:45.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
