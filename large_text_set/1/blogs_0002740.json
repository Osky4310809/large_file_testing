Both are overhead lifts and involve a full body range of motion. The goal is to lift maximum weight at a rapid speed using a barbell. \nTo do a snatch , start with your feet hip-width apart in a squat position. Lift the weight up past your legs to your chest. Then, shrug your shoulders and pull yourself under the bar, going into a full squat. As the bar passes your head, push it and straighten up — all in one motion. \nThe clean and jerk is two motions. Start by bending over and grabbing the bar with a shoulder-width grip. Drop your hips into a squat position with a flat back and straight arms flat. Lift to your shoulders, pause, then jerk or thrust the bar overhead and straighten arms again. \nSpeed is what sets Olympic weightlifting apart from powerlifting. Powerlifting segments the lifts into the squat, the bench press, and the deadlift and the movement can be done slower as the lifter increases weight. But with Olympic lifting, the lift combines several of these movements into the snatch, and the clean and jerk into one, quick, fluid motion. \"A lot of women love it, because unlike power lifting, which is picking something up, squatting, or benching, this is a lot more artistic,\" says Hopkins. \"The snatch is very technical, and when it's done well, it's a really beautiful thing to watch.\" \nThe benefits of spending 30 minutes twice a week working on your clean and jerk form can yield impressive results. Here are just a few of the reasons to give picking up some serious weights a try.

Training with heavy weights will not make you look bulky (unless you combine your weight training with a significant increase in calorie consumption and supplements). In fact, most Olympic weightlifters have a body type that resembles that of sprinters. \nAccording to several studies , Olympic weightlifting increases lean body mass and reduces body fat percentage. Olympic lifting focuses on coordination and speed, building strength more slowly and creating lean muscle. \n\"Olympic weight training is not like body building where you are forcing your muscle to grow,\" says Sean Waxman, owner of Waxman's Gym in Los Angeles. Waxman, a nationally competitive Olympic weightlifting coach, says women make up 50 percent of general membership at his gym and more than half of his competitive team. Reason #2: It's a full-body workout. 4 of 11 All photos \nOlympic lifts aren't just good for your core. You'll work your back, arms, and shoulders, too. One of the unique benefits of Olympic weightlifting is the efficiency of the training—you get a full-body workout in a recommended 20- to 30-minute session. \n\"A lot of sports are segmented but Olympic weightlifting uses your whole body at once,\" say Hopkins. \"The deadlift, catching the barbell in a front squat, and pushing it over your head all in one movement requires the use and coordination of all your muscle groups.\" Photo: Getty Images Reason #3: Your core will be stronger than ever. 5 of 11 All photos \nThese lifts are killer for your core. \"Nothing is more intense on your abs, legs, and butt than when you catch a barbell on your shoulders in a clean and jerk,\" says Hopkins. \nThe farther you move weight away from your core, the more strain it puts on your midsection to stabilize. When you do a snatch, a heavy load is as far away from your body as it can get. Photo: Getty Images Reason #4: You'll be motivated to take better care of your body. 6 of 11 All photos \nA.J. Marsden, an assistant professor at Beacon College in Leesburg, Florida, and a former U.S. Army surgical nurse, has been incorporating the snatch and the clean and jerk into her weight training routine for three years. In addition to increasing her endurance, she has also noticed the training led to a heightened appetite. \"But because most of my body weight consists of muscle, I can eat more calories a day because my body will burn it off,\" she says. \"I've also found that because I feel and look good, I'm motivated to eat well, too.\" Photo: Getty Images Reason #5: You'll supercharge your other workouts. 7 of 11 All photos \nLifting heavy weights at a quick pace using a full body range of motion requires all your muscle fibers to work together to produce the power your body needs. This improves your overall speed and coordination. \n\"Olympic weightlifting is a very rapid up to immediate down,\" says Hopkins. \"Your muscles go from being fully tense in one direction to fully relaxed in the other direction as fast as possible. Your nervous system has to fire at a very rapid rate—improving sprinting, jumping, and other movements .\" Photo: Getty Images Reason #6: You'll improve your bone health. 8 of 11 \nOlympic weightlifters have a higher bone mineral density than average healthy people. Because women have an increased risk of osteoporosis, this is important for long-term health. Reason #7: Lifting ridiculously heavy stuff is cool. 9 of 11 All photos \n\"When you get stronger and more aware of your body, your feel more able in life,\" says Heather Farmer, a nationally ranked Olympic weightlifter and coach at Solace New York. \"You get a huge sense of empowerment. When you can lift your own body weight over your head, what can't you do?\" \nFarmer says she's noticed a big improvement in her own self-esteem as well as in the self-esteem of the women she trains. The discipline and confidence developed in this type of training carries over into all aspects of their lives. \nMarsden agrees and says, \"Lifting has given me a confidence that I haven't experienced with other sports. I feel strong and that gives me the confidence to try new things, such as rock climbing with my brother or surfing with my husband.\" Reason #8: It's safer than you might think. 10 of 11 All photos \nWhen you see a barbell racked with 100 pounds, you may think trying to lift that over your head might end up with you killing yourself in any number of ways. But the truth is, when done correctly, Olympic weightlifting causes fewer injuries than Major League Baseball and many other sports. \nAccording to Farmer, poor form and hesitation are the biggest causes of injuries. She advises women just starting out to take the time to learn how to properly miss a lift and to focus on the basics of form before adding weight to the barbell. Photo: Getty Images Reason #9: Olympic lifting is a mental workout, too. 11 of 11 All photos \nFarmer, who started Olympic weightlifting five years ago, says what sets this type of exercise apart from other fitness and athletic activities is the sense of accomplishment she gets from improving her technique. \"I equate Olympic lifting to playing the piano,\" she says. \"It requires a high level of skill, and even at the most elite levels of Olympic weightlifting, you never stop refining your skills.\" Photo: Getty Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:04:01.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
