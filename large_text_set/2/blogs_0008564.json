Could   \nHull City are still fighting away at the foot of the Premier League table, but the appointment of new boss Marco Silva has breathed new life into their battle to avoid relegation. \nThe Tigers have picked up some impressive results in recent weeks, including drawing with Manchester United at Old Trafford and beating Liverpool at home, but their struggles early in the campaign mean that they are still in the bottom three . \nAnd one of the main reasons for that is that they keep shooting themselves in the foot. These aren't all your fault, Marco (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) \nBecause incredibly, Hull have now conceded 11 penalties in the Premier League this season, beating the previous record of 10 set by Mark Hughes' Blackburn Rovers side in the 2006/07 season. \nAnd Hull have THIRTEEN games remaining. Sparky's Blackburn team were 'masters' at conceding spot-kicks (Photo: getty) \nThe run of conceding spot-kicks began on the opening day of the campaign when Hull beat Leicester, and it has just snowballed from there. \nThe full list reads: 1.
