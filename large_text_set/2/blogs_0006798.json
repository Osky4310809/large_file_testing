Normally, I’d say you’d have to be a Death Eater to even contemplate Hermione Granger and Lord Voldemort getting together, but this magical “ Beauty and the Beast ” and “ Harry Potter ” mashup makes this odd romance almost make sense. \nThe fake trailer hits on some similarities between the Beast and You Know Who. Both are orphans, for instance. YouTube Of course, when Maurice shows up in this mashup, Voldy does not hesitate to use the Killing Curse. GET OUT OF THERE, MAURICE! YouTube When Belle… uh, I mean, Hermione shines some light on the B-… I mean, Voldemort, she’s understandably terrified. YouTube Of course, Voldemort really has to work on his “smile” with the rest of his anthropomorphic household appliances. YouTube \nHe also might try perfecting a laugh that isn’t so sinister. Just a thought, Voldemort. Voldemort staring into the magical mirror at Hermione is just… wrong. YouTube \nMaybe the mirror is a horcrux. Are these birds under the Imperius curse? I don’t think any animal would enjoy the Dark Lord’s company, except for maybe his snake Nagini. YouTube \nAlso, can we get Voldemort some Aveeno hand moisturizer? He’s basically me every damn winter. Speaking of Nagini, here she is walking Hermione to the rose. Best friends forever! YouTube \nHonestly, this makes me wish Nagini and Hermione were contestants on “The Bachelor.” Can you imagine if Hermione was taken to the Yule Ball… by Lord Voldemort? YouTube \nThat’d make Ron really jealous. And scared. “Gaston, the boy who is roughly the size of a barn, come to die…” YouTube \nOverall, this mashup done by Pistol Shrimps is masterfully edited. \nAnd if Voldemort and Hermione can find love in 2017, there’s hope for all of us Muggles, too. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
