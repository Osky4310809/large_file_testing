We must all fight side by side. I'm standing by Tom Perez's side, and I hope you will join me in doing the same.\" \nHarrison was said to have had the third largest number of votes committed to him in a crowded field of eight candidates, and he could bring as many as 20 votes into Perez' column, according to a source familiar with the situation. \nThat might be enough to put Perez over the top on the first round of voting Saturday in his struggle against his closest rival, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. \nThe DNC has 447 members and a simple majority of them is needed to win . Perez and Ellison were thought to be roughly evenly matched, so neither had been expected to win in the first round of voting. \n\"Every person who knows Jaime Harrison will say he is one of the smartest, most dedicated, and genuine leaders we know,\" Perez said in a statement. \"If elected chair, I will work with Jaime and others who are running for chair to bring our party together because it will take every one of us to unite a party that is suffering from a crisis of confidence and relevance. I hope you will join Jaime and I as we stand united to make the Democratic Party the strongest it has ever been.\" \nLast week, Ellison picked up the endorsement of another former candidate, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley, who also leads the association of state party chairs. \nEndorsement deals between candidates are common in internal party races like this one, and it's possible more candidates will exit before voting begins Saturday morning. \nIn his email to DNC members, Harrison, a former top congressional aide, said he didn't see a way him to win. \n\"In a former job, I whipped votes for House Democrats. I know what a path to victory looks like. Despite strong performances at the debate and DNC regional forums, the votes are simply not there for me to secure victory on Saturday,\" he said. \nHarrison, a charismatic young chairman from a red state, was in a battle for third place with South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttiegieg. Both candidates' paths to victory depended on a deadlock between Perez and Ellison, which might then lead DNC members to rally behind an alternative. \nHarrison had a larger constituency inside the DNC, but Buttiegieg built a national following. \nOn Wednesday, former DNC Chairman Howard Dean became the fifth former party chair to endorse Buttiegig, after saying he was deciding between Harrison and Buttiegieg. \n\"Jaime and I are very very close. I've known him since he was in his twenties,\" Dean said on a conference call with reporters. \"We had more conversations than I had probably with any other candidate.\" \n\"I came to the concussions that Pete was the best chance for an outside-the-beltway candidate to win,\" Dean continued.
