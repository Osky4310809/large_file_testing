However, she looks far younger than what is her actual age. Urmila, who married Mohsin Akhtar Mir last year has recently joined Instagram and her pictures are stunning. It seems she might make her comeback soon. On this occasion, filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma with whom she has given some of best films took to Twitter to wish her. The actress is known to be extremely warm but a very private person. Urmila Matondkar‚Äôs Insta account has snaps of her in yoga postures and she is known for her love for Yoga. (Also Read: Urmila Matondkar makes a MAST Instagram debut ‚Äì view pics) \nRam Gopal Varma was the person who gave her some of her most acclaimed work like Rangeela, Bhoot, Mast and Satya. The filmmaker has admitted towards Urmila than his other heroines and just could not accept her as a normal girl. He always liked her as a diva. Urmila was RGV‚Äôs muse and on the occasion he had a lovely wish for her. He tweeted‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs wishing the RANGEELA girl URMILA the HAPPIEST, the BESTEST,and the GREATEST BIRTHDAY ..FOREVER YOUNG and FOREVER BEAUTIFUL üôèüôèüôè pic.twitter.com/1ajn4LtzrH \n‚Äî Ram Gopal Varma (@RGVzoomin) February 4, 2017 \nWe know that RGV is mesmerised with Urmila‚Äôs beauty. In an column, he said, ‚ÄúAfter coming into films, the first girl to have an impact on me was Urmila Matondkar. I was mesmerised by her beauty ‚Äî from her face to her figure‚Ä¶ everything about her was just divine. She had done a few films before Rangeela, which hadn‚Äôt done well and she hadn‚Äôt made much of an impact on the audience either. Then, after Rangeela, she became the nation‚Äôs sex symbol. That doesn‚Äôt mean it was I who made her look beautiful. I would say that she was a painting and I simply framed her. Apart from the frame, for a painting to be truly relished, it also needs the right place for it to be displayed in, and that place was Rangeela. One of my primary motives in making Rangeela was to capture Urmila‚Äôs beauty eternally on camera and to make it a benchmark for sex symbols. I would say that I have never felt more of a cinematic high than when I watched her through my camera on the sets of Rangeela.‚Äù \nConsidering their track record of past work, we would be kicked if they announced a film together. What say?
