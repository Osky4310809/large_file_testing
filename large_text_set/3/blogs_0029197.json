Our members are business owners as well as consumers who recognize and fight for the financial and potential public health benefits of the e-vapor industry. I have traveled to Washington, D.C. myself to advocate for consumer rights within this industry which now faces enormous regulatory hurdles which could shut down businesses and remove most e-vapor products from the market. For these reasons, we must urge Congress to enact H.R. 1136, a bill which modernizes the predicate date of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) e-vapor product rules. \nAlabama's pro-growth regulatory environment has incentivized an array of companies to expand their operations within the state, including Mercedes-Benz, Airbus, and Hyundai. These companies employ thousands of Alabamians all across the state. Alabama can continue to offer economic incentives and pro-growth regulations. However, bureaucratic red tape at the federal level can still threaten employers operating in Alabama, especially small businesses. \nThe e-vapor industry has the potential to catalyze an economic boon for Alabamians. More than 200 small businesses that sell e-vapor products already operate in Alabama. These businesses collectively employ more than 2,000 people in the state. Unfortunately, existing FDA regulations could roll back this growth, threatening Alabama jobs in the process. \nThe current predicate date in the FDA e-vapor products rules is February 15, 2007. All e-vapor products introduced after that date could soon be removed from shelves until successful completion of new product applications, an expensive process that could take years. Since there were very few vapor products on the market in 2007, e-vapor businesses in Alabama could soon be forced to close. \nThe potential limitations this current predicate date places on consumer choice should not be underestimated. Members of BEAA believe adult consumers have a right to continued access to vapor products. As many have chosen vaping as a less harmful alternative to traditional tobacco products, it would be extremely irresponsible to suddenly take away this consumer choice. \nCongressmen Tom Cole and Sanford Bishop have introduced the FDA Deeming Authority Clarification Act of 2017 (H.R.1136), bipartisan legislation that would modernize the FDA's predicate date. We must contact our leaders to urge their support of this legislation. I also urge Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tom Price to work to delay the FDA's filing deadline for new e-vapor products for at least two years. Vapor technology is constantly improving, and delaying this deadline would ensure that Alabama e-vapor businesses can continue to offer the highest quality vapor products. \nEnacting H.R. 1136 to modernize the FDA's predicate date is a common-sense regulatory reform. It will save and strengthen Alabama's small businesses and protect consumer access to less harmful alternatives to regular tobacco products. It is my hope that you will join the Breathe Easier Alliance of Alabama in supporting this pro-growth initiative.
