Which seems only fair given that Ben Affleck 's Batman is already moving towards his own solo adventure. \nCollider's sources say that Vaughn hasn't entered any sort of deal-making stage, but that he's top of the studio's wishlist for the job, especially since he once pitched a Superman movie to the company back before it went the Steel route. And if he doesn't end up in the director's chair for this one, the offer is apparently open to take on another title. \nVaughn could well be a good fit for the film, especially if he's able to fly Supes in a slightly more lighthearted direction. But it's all just speculation until contracts are signed and the situation is nowhere near that just yet. \nVaughn's latest, Kingsman: The Golden Circle will be out on 29 September this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T02:19:21.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
