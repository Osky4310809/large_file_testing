They spent 10 1/2 Million dollars in an advertising campaign to beat the tax, they lost,” he said. “They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and they lost. And they’ll continue to lose because their legal case is not sound and their public case is not sound.” \nKenney said he believes most customers understand the reason for the tax and he believes it doesn’t need to impact them as much as it has. \n“They’re gouging their own customers.” \nAmong retailers, only Shop Rite has responded, saying they are passing the tax along because it greatly increases sweetened beverage prices and it wants customers to know.
