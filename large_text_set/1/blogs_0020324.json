This is a question that will likely inspire endless debate. We’re well past the point of Ed Wood-like cheerful incompetence hitting the screen, after all, so it really boils down to which rote, uninspired studio product most broke our hearts or irritated our senses. And despite what you might think, 2016’s favorite critical whipping boy didn’t quite make the top of the list.\nDon’t get us wrong, Batman V. Superman: Dawn Of Justice did “well” with the Razzie committee, landing eight nominations, but the real “winner,” to the extent we can use the term, is Zoolander No. 2 , which by all accounts is sinking to the honor it deserves . The Razzie committee claims there were so many bad movies this year they had to expand the categories, but considering they were the only five to ten people who saw convicted felon Dinesh D’Souza’s Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party , we suspect them of protesting too much.\nSo, what else got “honored?” Here are the nominees:\nWORST PICTURE \nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\nDirty Grandpa\nGods of Egypt\nHillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party\nIndependence Day: Resurgence\nZoolander No. 2 \nWORST ACTOR \nBen Affleck / Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \nGerard Butler / Gods of Egypt & London Has Fallen \nHenry Cavill / Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \nRobert de Niro / Dirty Grandpa \nDinesh D’Souza [as Himself] / Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party \nBen Stiller / Zoolander No. 2 \nWORST ACTRESS \nMegan Fox / Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows \nTyler Perry / BOO!
