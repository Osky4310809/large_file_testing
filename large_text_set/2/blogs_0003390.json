This was a decision of the university,” Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin said in an interview.\n“I think the university should have consulted with the city before they made the decision to invite this person to the campus,” Arreguin said. “There should have been some serious consideration about whether he should have been invited to begin with, given the fact that he’s provoked a violent response on other campuses.”\nSukey Lewis on Twitter Bank of America on Shattuck #miloatcal @KQEDnews\n\nUC police were in touch with Berkeley city police about the event well before Wednesday night, according to campus spokesman Dan Mogulof.\nThe demonstrations involved more than a thousand protesters. Campus officials say police and the university could not have anticipated that some of them would “invade” the campus to shut down the Yiannopoulos event.\nThe campus police department has launched an investigation into Wednesday night’s violence. UC Berkeley officials say about 150 masked individuals hurled Molotov cocktails, set fires and pushed barricades into windows.\nNine people were treated for injuries at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center over a two-day period, and three men were arrested in connection with the protest.\nThe union that represents UC police says there wasn’t a good tactical plan in place beforehand.\n“They were unable to assist the citizens and the public that were out there that were defenseless against these rioters, who were actively engaging in breaking the law and attacking defenseless citizens,” said John Bakhit, an attorney who represents the Federated University Police Officers Association.\nBakhit said in an interview that UC Berkeley police officers were ordered not to take any enforcement action against protesters who lit fires and threw rocks, bottles and fireworks at them. He said there weren’t enough officers on hand at the start of the protests to make arrests and protect the public.\n\nMilitant protesters used police barricades to break windows on the Martin Luther King, Jr. Student Union building during a demonstration against the scheduled appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley on Feb. 1, 2017. (Bert Johnson/KQED) “When these rioters saw that there was no action taken against them, it emboldened them into acting more aggressively,” Bakhit said.\nCampus officials would not comment on the union’s criticism, but Mogulof said that civilian university staff does not interfere in law enforcement decisions.\nChancellor Nicholas Dirks and other campus officials have condemned the actions of protesters who committed vandalism .\n“The violence was an attack on our fundamental values, which are maintaining and nurturing open inquiry and an inclusive, civil society — the bedrock of a genuinely democratic nation,” Dirks said in a statement. “We are now, and will remain in the future, committed to Free Speech not only as a vital component of our campus identity, but as essential to our educational mission.”\nHours after the protest, President Donald Trump suggested possible cuts to federal funding for UC Berkeley in a tweet that prompted sharp criticism from Rep. Barbara Lee, whose district includes Berkeley.\n\nKQED’s Sukey Lewis and Devin Katayama contributed reporting to this story.
