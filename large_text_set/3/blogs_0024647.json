Getty Images 4 Sir Alex Ferguson guided Manchester United to 13 league titles \nBut whilst the 75-year-old reaped the rewards on the pitch, Ferguson has opened up about his home life and what it took to stay at the club for so long. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Manchester United news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nSpeaking to ESPN he said: “When I came to United in 1986, I never thought for a minute I would last 27-and-a-half years. \n“And that was done simply because I had the energy to do that. \n“I had great energy, and I sacrificed [a lot] — my kids would grow up with my wife, and the role she played was really important. I didn’t need any motivation. You don’t need motivation at Manchester United. Getty Images Sir Alex Ferguson sacrificed time with his wife and kids to stay at Manchester United for the long haul \n“The history of that club is enough. So I enjoyed a fantastic spell.” \nDespite United leading the way for English sides in the Europa League, Premier League giants have once again disappointed in Europe’s elite competition, the Champions League. \nOnly Leicester are left in the last eight after Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham were all eliminated. \nBut Ferguson believes it is only a matter of time until English sides can dominate Europe once again. \nHe added: “I think success is cyclical.

We [Man United] were in three finals in four years. \n\"[Now] the domain is in Spain. There's no question about that. The same question could be asked about why are the German teams, why are Bayern Munich not winning the Champions League? Rex Features 4 Leicester are the only team left flying the flag in the Champions League \n\"Why are the Italians not winning it? Why are the French not winning it? And why are the English not winning it? \n\"I think the moment, the cycle is with the Spanish teams. They're the best, and that's why they're winning it. But that will change, that can change. You know, [Cristiano] Ronaldo will get older, [Lionel] Messi will get older. Can they replace these players? And I think the cycle will change.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:42:23.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
