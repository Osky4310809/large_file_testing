They co-ordinate their messages. And they are also praising Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ahead of Thursday's by-election in Stoke-on-Trent Central . There's no evidence that they are connected to Labour or any other political party, however. \nNuttall, who was elected UKIP leader in November , is contesting the seat, which has traditionally been solid for Labour. \nThe Twitter network appears to be attempting to try to swing voters by coordinating its messages, firing out memes which play up anti-UKIP news in quick succession: Image copyright @thomasicschenk1/Twitter Image copyright @Spectral_News/Twitter \nThere is of course nothing unusual about political messaging on Twitter - and these accounts don't have big numbers of followers or retweets - but the strange shift from pro-Russian to anti-UKIP messaging has caught people's attention. \nThe network was initially uncovered by Alex King, an independent researcher who tweets as @GlasnostGone .
