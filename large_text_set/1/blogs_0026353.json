Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a noted military veteran who fervently believes that a man should always stick to his word. \nDuring the tiff, Schumer argued that the Senate had never before confirmed a CIA director on Inauguration Day. According to Hayes, Shumer also rudely slammed Cotton, saying that if Cotton had he been around the Senate eight years earlier, he would know that Republicans had similarly prevented then-President-elect Barack Obama’s CIA pick from being confirmed on Inauguration Day. \n“ Eight years ago, I was getting my ass shot at in Afghanistan ,” Cotton snapped back. “So don’t talk to me about where I was eight years ago.”   \nOuch. But the feud was not over yet. \nWhen Cotton questioned Schumer about why he had gone back on his word, the New York senator claimed that he had only been speaking for himself. \n“I said that I would not block him,” Shumer said, according to Hayes. “I’m not telling Ron Wyden to do this. Why don’t you go talk to Wyden?” \nWhat a jerk. Apparently, Chuck Schumer is not a man who sticks to his word. He is instead a liar, a deceiver and a con artist. It is no wonder he fits in so perfectly with the Democrat Party.
