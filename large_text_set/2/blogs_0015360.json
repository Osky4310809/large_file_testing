By: FE Online | Published: February 20, 2017 2:02 PM Nilekani recently said with new digital payment systems like BHIM and UPI in place, around 15-20 per cent of the country’s personal consumption expenditure will become digital in next one year from the current level of 5 per cent. \nStating that he got major support from both UPA and NDA governments for Aadhar, Nandan Nilekani on Monday said that Modi government is looking to introduce digi-locker and Aadhar will be helpful in that. Speaking in Bengaluru at an event, where Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was also present, he further said that speed and scale is necessary for roll-out of government supported projects. “I strongly believe India will be ‘data-rich’ before being ‘economically rich'”, he added. \nNilekani recently said with new digital payment systems like BHIM and UPI in place, around 15-20 per cent of the country’s personal consumption expenditure will become digital in next one year from the current level of 5 per cent. “With new technologies like Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), Unified Payment Interface (UPI), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Aadhar micro ATM and Aadhar merchant pay, there will be significant push towards digital transactions because the infrastructure we will have is completely different from anywhere else,” he said at a Federal Bank event. \n“My own estimate is that today about 5 per cent of personal consumption expenditure in India is digital, and I am very confident that next year or so, as much as 15-20 per cent of our consumption expenditure will be digital.” Nilekani said banks will also witnessed changes from point of view of the transactions fee. “Historically, banking system has seen high value transactions with high transaction costs. They will now have to move to the world where the transaction value would be low, and the fee will be low, but the number of transactions would multiply many times,” he said. . @NandanNilekani , Co-founder, @Infosys to @satyanadella : India will be ‘data-rich’ before becoming economically rich. pic.twitter.com/HwM1dWXcil \n— CNBC-TV18 News (@CNBCTV18News) February 20, 2017 \nNilekani said while demonetisation has had it challenges, it has accelerated the role of the country building the world’s most advanced digital financial infrastructure. “What demonetisation did was that it gave a sense of urgency to complete all the technical and regulatory impediments to create this (digital payment infrastructure),” he said. \nAccording to Nilekani, debit and credit cards will continue to be the payment modes as there is a section of the market that will need cards. \nYou may also like to watch: \n“Cards are very important for global travellers. But if everything goes well then the UPI transactions will quickly overtake the cards transactions. There will more of them, maybe lesser value but there will be many more of them,” he said.
