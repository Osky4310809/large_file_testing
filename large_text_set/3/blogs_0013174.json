Myles Simmons of the Rams' official website announced the agreement between Barwin and the team. Per ESPN's Adam Caplan , the deal is for one year at a maximum value of $6.5 million. After starting his career with the Houston Texans , Barwin spent the past four seasons with the Eagles . He was one of the NFL 's best pass-rushers in 2014 when he recorded a career-high 14.5 sacks and was named to the Pro Bowl. In the two seasons since that breakout performance, Barwin has been unable to show those same skills off the edge. Last year was difficult for him as the rest of the Eagles' front seven put together a strong overall performance. Michael Renner of Pro Football Focus ranked the Eagles' front seven as the second-best unit in the NFL overall, but Barwin had the lowest grade among the group at 42.1. Ryan Smith of Pro Football Focus noted how bad Barwin's performance looked in comparison to teammate Brandon Graham: Ryan Smith @RSmithNFL Connor Barwin: $6M/yr - 426 pass snaps - 28 pressures (92nd) Brandon Graham: $6.5M/yr - 457 - 77 (4th) BG has 1.5 more sacks. @PFF #Eagles 12/29/2016, 7:06:49 PM The Eagles decided to release Barwin on March 9, the first date of free agency, giving him an opportunity to find a new team that will make better use of his skill set. The decline in Barwin's performance last season did coincide with a move to defensive end. He started his career at the position, but his best success came when the Texans moved him to outside linebacker in 2011 after he suffered a season-ending ankle injury in Week 1 the previous year. Other teams certainly were aware of that past success, as one NFC personnel man told Mark Eckel of NJ.com in February when Barwin's name first came up in trade discussions. \"If they cut him, teams will be lining up for him,'' he said. \"He wouldn't be out of a job for long. I would think they could trade him and get something back. He has value. His deal this year isn't that bad.\" As long as Barwin's new team understands the best way to utilize him is as an edge-rusher at outside linebacker instead of putting him directly on the line, he will be able to play closer to what he did in 2014. The Rams have a solid defensive line, led by two-time All-Pro Aaron Donald, but they are in need of more depth. Renner ranked the Rams' entire front seven as the NFL's fourth-best unit last season but acknowledged one performance that has become worrisome. \"The play, when healthy, from defensive end Robert Quinn, though, is mildly concerning,\" Renner wrote. \"His pass-rushing productivity has declined every year since 2013.\" Quinn has gone from 19 sacks in 2013 to four last season. He hasn't been able to stay on the field over the past two seasons, missing a combined 15 games during that stretch. The Rams do run out of a 4-3 base defense, which has not been Barwin's strength, but he's also going to a situation with an elite defensive tackle in Donald who commands so much attention that it will allow him to play better than he did last year in Philadelphia. Last year should not be taken as the definitive word on Barwin as an NFL defender. He was trying to play a position for the first time in six years. He's not far removed from being a bona fide pass-rushing star.
