It‚Äôs only right.\nIt started this afternoon when CNN‚Äôs Angela Rye criticized Donald Trump ‚Äòs presidency by saying, ‚Äú Barack Obama had to be the next best thing to Jesus and here we are, just two months in and some change, there is issue after issue.‚Äù We took note of the statement and wrote it up , which caught the attention of Joe Walsh, a former single-term congressman known for tweeting at Obama a threat of ‚Äúwar,‚Äù among other things.\nWalsh interpreted Rye‚Äôs statement about the standards Obama had to live up to as a direct comparison to Jesus:\n. @angela_rye : ‚ÄúBarack Obama was the next best thing to Jesus.‚Äù\nHuh? Angela, that‚Äôs why u can‚Äôt be taken seriously. https://t.co/MGIeQNddr0\n‚Äî Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) March 28, 2017\nRye responded to Walsh like this:\nTry again, you LAME! You guys STAY TWISTING WORDS! https://t.co/WYjgCFWOMw\n‚Äî a. rye‚úäüèæ (@angela_rye) March 28, 2017\nIt continued:\n. @angela_rye Its ok to be pro-Obama. But Angela, it‚Äôs never good to WORSHIP any politician. No politician can be compared to Jesus. Cool? https://t.co/NJM3XgxkSl\n‚Äî Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) March 28, 2017\nThis is why you served ONE term in the house, playboy. You‚Äôre listening skills? Wack. Reading comprehension? More wack. #trollELSEWHERE https://t.co/HaC4O2pOI2\n‚Äî a. rye‚úäüèæ (@angela_rye) March 28, 2017\nWalsh did eventually come around to realize Rye‚Äôs intended meaning:\n. @angela_rye And your way wrong on your main point Angela. We LOWERED the bar for Obama. He was held to a lower standard cuz he was black. https://t.co/OMXphLZUTj\n‚Äî Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) March 28, 2017\nHe even apologized:\n. @angela_rye I‚Äôll do something rare on twitter. I‚Äôll apologize. Angela, I misinterpreted you. I‚Äôm sorry about that.\nI mean it. https://t.co/OMXphLZUTj\n‚Äî Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) March 28, 2017\nRegardless, MSNBC‚Äôs Joy Reid jumped in:\nFirst of all, it‚Äôs ‚Äúyou‚Äôre,‚Äù as in ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE not fit to be Obama‚Äôs intern.‚Äù Second, who‚Äôs ‚Äúwe?‚Äù People who owe back child support, perhaps? https://t.co/eaulI7jaFo\n‚Äî Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) March 28, 2017\nSo did CNN‚Äôs W. Kamau Bell :\nDid white men decide that today is the day to put Black women back in their place? Because that‚Äôs not today. That‚Äôs the 3rd of Neveruary.üòÄ pic.twitter.com/Zkqg5D6egZ\n‚Äî W. Kamau Bell (@wkamaubell) March 28, 2017\nAnd actor Don Cheadle :\nWhat‚Äôs a typo? And name call at will, Joe. Your tweet is inherently racist and we can all see that. https://t.co/m2DwkoYgRL\n‚Äî Don Cheadle (@DonCheadle) March 28, 2017\nAs noted in the Bell tweet, Walsh‚Äôs misinterpretation of Rye‚Äôs comments and Twitter provocation were especially noteworthy today, given that Bill O‚ÄôReilly has been under fire all afternoon for comments he made about Representative Maxine Waters this morning. Sean Spicer , too, faced criticism after today‚Äôs press briefing for telling reporter April Ryan to stop shaking her head.\nBill and Sean are showing the world how Black Women get talked about and treated everyday.\nTake notice-and do something.\n‚Äî Brittany Packnett (@MsPackyetti) March 28, 2017\nBill O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs treatment of Rep. Waters & Spicer‚Äôs treatment of April Ryan = examples of white men trying to silence successful black women\n‚Äî Kaivan Shroff (@KaivanShroff) March 28, 2017\nLike Walsh, O‚ÄôReilly, too, has apologized .\n[image via screengrab]\n‚Äî‚Äî\nLindsey: Twitter .
