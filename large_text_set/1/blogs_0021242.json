The officers said Hernandez drove the car at them, accelerating.\nIn June, Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey decided to forego criminal charges against the officers, saying they were justified in shooting because it was reasonable to assume Jordan’s life was in danger.\nWhite’s statement Monday noted that Morrissey declined to bring charges and that the FBI had found no evidence of a federal civil rights violation.\n“After reviewing the facts and circumstances of the shooting death of Ms. Jessica Hernandez, it has been determined that the officers involved in the incident used appropriate force in compliance with the departmental policies and procedures that existed at the time of the incident,” White said in the statement. “Nonetheless, this incident is a tragedy for all involved. Ms. Hernandez had her whole life in front of her and we mourn her loss with the family.”\nThe statement said the police department “places great value on the sanctity of life and mourns with the community when a life is lost tragically.”\nThe shooting of the teen fueled outrage in the community concerning police response and tactics.\nThe Denver Police Department has since changed policy on shooting at moving cars. Officers no longer are allowed to shoot at a moving car unless someone inside is firing at them.\nThe shooting has been reviewed multiple times by multiple agencies, Denver police said Monday.\nThe DA’s report had found: “The fact that the three bullets that struck Hernandez were fired from the driver’s side of the car does not alter any of my conclusions and does not vitiate the legal justifications of acting in self-defense or defense of another. Officer Jordan fired one bullet through the driver side window that struck Hernandez. The evidence indicates that this was Officer Jordan’s final shot, and that it was fired when the Honda was still a threat to him. The evidence shows that he was in the process of pushing away from the Honda as he fired this shot. Officer Greene fired three shots from the driver side of the car, two of which struck Hernandez. The evidence shows that all of Officer Greene’s shots were fired in order to defend Officer Jordan.”\nWhite’s statement backed the findings of previous reports and investigations.\n“I understand that the death of Ms. Hernandez has been difficult for her loved ones and for members of our community,” White said. “It is my hope that the information provided in this letter will shed light on the events that took place on January 26, 2015, the investigations and reviews that followed, and the facts and reasoning that led to the department’s decision” not to pursue any actions against the officers involved.\nThe statement from Hernandez’s family said they hold out “hope that no other family or community will have to experience their pain. … Not a day goes by that they don’t think about and miss their beloved Jessie.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:34:31.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
