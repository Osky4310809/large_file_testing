CHP - Valley Division i \nBy Tony Bizjak and Nashelly Chavez Crews make solid progress shoring up damaged spillway \n6:40 a.m. \nCrews working through the night atop the crippled Oroville Dam have made solid progress in shoring up the damaged emergency spillway, state officials reported Tuesday morning. \nThe state officials said they are not, however, ready to end the evacuation order that has displaced tens of thousands of residents of Oroville and other cities in the Feather River floodplain. \n“We don’t want to bring them back until we are 100 percent assured that they can stay back in their homes,” Chris Orrock of the state Department of Water Resources said. \nHelicopters will begin work again this morning at sunrise, dropping large bags of rocks and debris into the large crevice on the emergency spillway. \n“We’re preparing for that next weather system coming in,” said Orrock. “We’re looking pretty good right now. The next couple of days will be telling.” \nThe dam’s damaged main spillway continues to carry 100,000 cubic feet of water per second. \nInspectors say the spillway is holding steady, and does not appear to be further eroded by the outflows in recent days. \nLake levels meanwhile continue to drop overnight. Water resources official say they would like to see the level at 860 feet by Thursday when inflows should be starting from this weeks expected rains. That would put the lake level at more than 40 feet below the top of the emergency spillway. \nIt was at 889 feet as of 6 a.m. \nTony Bizjak Lake Oroville has fallen more than 13 feet since evacuation began \n6:15 a.m. \nLake Oroville water levels continue to fall as state officials send nearly 100,000 cubic feet of water per second down the main spillway in hopes of dropping the reservoir as much as 25 feet by the time the next storm arrives Wednesday night. \nAccording to the latest state data, the lake was at 889.49 feet as of 6 a.m., more than 13 feet below where it stood when evacuation orders came down Sunday evening. \nWill it hold? Oroville Dam makes it through a key test \nCrews are working furiously to bolster eroded sections of the emergency spillway. That damage occurred after the lake topped 901 feet on Saturday morning and sent water over the concrete lip of that spillway for the first time since Oroville Dam was built in 1968. \nEvacuations of 188,000 people from Oroville down to Plumas Lake remain in effect. With little notice, residents fled Sunday night to evacuation centers , hotels and relatives’ homes throughout the region, including the greater Sacramento area. Emergency shelters are operating in Roseville, Woodland and at Cal Expo. The area’s Sikh temples also have opened up their doors to help evacuees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:35:31.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
