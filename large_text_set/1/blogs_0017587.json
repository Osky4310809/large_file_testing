Taylor advised him to move, at which point Wenger lost it and appeared to shove the official.\" \n\"Wenger and his team have benefited from plenty of 'close calls' by officials this season and he should have remembered that and stayed calm.\" Granit Xhaka was sent off in Arsenal's win (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Read More Watch Arsene Wenger react like a guilty school boy \nWenger could indeed face a noticeable ban. When Paul Ince was in charge of Blackpool in 2013, he was handed a five-match stadium ban for shoving a fourth official. \nAnd Arsenal's discipline problems face further scrutiny after Granit Xhaka was also sent off during Sunday's win over Burnley after a careless lunge on Steven Defour.
