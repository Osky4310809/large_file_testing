You get to see your favorite celebrities gain recognition for their hard work in the film industry, which is awesome! But, let’s also be honest with ourselves. Most of us actually tune in for the fashion, right? The gowns, the jewels, the suits! The fashion is all so lush and wonderful it deserves an award show for itself . Yet, there was one fashion choice at this year’s Globes that deserves ~ all the recognition ~ and that’s the plunging neckline .\nWe compiled a short list of our favorite plunging neckline ensembles from last night’s show. Of course, there were many more plunging necklines on the red carpet. But, listed below are, in our opinion, some of the most notable outfits.\nEmma Stone picked up a Golden Globe last night for her performance in La La Land . She did so while wearing this beautiful blush pink Valentino dress with silver detailing. She accentuated her plunging neckline with a Tiffany diamond drop choker.

DeMille and delivered a politically-charged speech that reminded us “when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” She did so while wearing a beautifully-bejeweled Givenchy gown. Getty Images / Alberto E. Rodriguez Clad in a unique, and definitely plunging, Elie Saab dress, Jessica Biel arrived with husband, Justin Timberlake, who made a hilarious cameo in the Globe’s cold open with host, Jimmy Fallon. Getty Images / David Crotty Drew Barrymore strutted down the red carpet looking like a straight-up goddess in her silver and white Monique Lhuillier gown. The cold-shoulder sleeves compliment the low neckline perfectly. Getty Images / Steve Granitz Kristen Bell was shooting us some Old Hollywood glamour vibes with her tuxedo-like sequined Jenny Packham gown, velvet clutch, and diamond accessories. Getty Images / David Crotty Sarah Jessica Parker showed up wearing a gorgeous Vera Wang piece that looks like it might be paying homage to the late Carrie Fisher’s Star Wars character, Princess Leia, matched with that hairdo. Perhaps so, perhaps no! Either way, SJP looks refined and classic. Getty Images / Michael Tran Okay! We see you, Priyanka Chopra, in that gold Ralph Lauren number! Yes, you’re dazzling! And, yes that plunging neckline looks absolutely stunning on you! Getty Images / JB Lacroix The Big Bang Theory’s Kaley Cuoco flaunted her figure in a silver sequined gown. Keeping accessories to a minimum, Cuoco brought a small clutch with her and wore her hair wavy to keep to that goddess aesthetic. Getty Images / C Flanigan This Is Us star, Mandy Moore, arrived in an elegant navy blue Naeem Khan creation complete with cape sleeves and a flowing crepe chiffon skirt. Moore completed the outfit with simple diamond earrings and a velvet clutch. Getty Images / Gregg DeGuire Orange is the New Black actress, Laverne Cox, arrived to the Warner Bros. Pictures’ 2017 Golden Globes After Party in this plunging cut-out dress by Mikael D. The mesh-paneled cut-outs paired with the leg slits makes this ensemble subtly sexy. Getty Images / JB Lacroix Victoria Justice, who starred in FOX’s rendition of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, arrived to the same after-party in this super-sexy lace-up ordeal that we’ve fallen deeply in love with. Her gladiator heels and sequined purse add more pizazz to this spectacle of an outfit. Getty Images / C Flanigan And finally, we have put The Crown’s Claire Foy on this list because her sparkling pink and silver Erdem creation is truly fit for an on-screen queen. The winner took home the prize for Best Actress in a Television Drama, and with that dress, the drama doesn’t cease. Getty Images / JB Lacroix Like we mentioned before, this is just a slice of the plunging neckline cake that was served at the Globes last night. Honorable mentions include (but are not limited to) Laura Dern, Kristin Cavallari, Leighton Meester, Minka Kelly, and Keke Palmer.\nEven if these beautiful stars didn’t leave with a Golden Globe, they are winning in the fashion category, so we hope they have some speeches prepared!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T03:13:39.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
