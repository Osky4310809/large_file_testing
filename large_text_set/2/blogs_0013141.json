He’s one of the best friends I’ll ever have. They don’t grow ’em like Marcus anymore. 10 \nBut many of you might not know his wife, Melanie Luttrell. Melanie has to deal with Marcus every single day. This has to be hard (Think roofing in the middle of August hard.) I mean, nobody should have to put up with that overgrown infant. And Melanie does it, like, everyday . \nToday is Melanie’s birthday and she told me if I did anything on theCHIVE I was dead meat, which was her first mistake. I’d love it if all the Chivers to go to Melanie’s last Instagram post and wish her happy birthday. Crush her Insta with kindness and bonkers messages. Melanie is one miracle short of sainthood and deserves some recognition for her everyday heroics. Thanks, Chivers. \nHappy Birthday, Mel!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:53:55.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
