Cops recovered the .45 caliber weapon.\n“It’s something you see in a movie,” said Officer Keith Gordon, the other of the two arriving cops.\nExcept for one thing:\n“It was real,” said Gordon, who’s been on the force for one-and-a-half years.\n“The adrenaline was very real,” he added.\nOne of the robbers, Quaimme Davies, 35, was charged with robbery and criminal possession of a defaced weapon. His 39-year-old accomplice has not yet been charged.\nLincoln Stevens, a mobile technician from Queens Village, had a front row seat to the Hollywood-style bust.\n“I was coming and a cop car came from behind with its lights on,” Stevens, 26, said. “I parked and got out to watch. [The cops] go in the bank, then the bank manager and teller come out with [their] hands tied. Fifteen cop cars come. A couple of [the cops] went in with their guns out. They took the suspects out.”\nHe continued: “Before you realized what was happening, it was over.”\nAdditional reporting by Laura Italiano \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T06:55:44.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
