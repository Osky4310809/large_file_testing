Daily Edition Rachel Maddow Mocked on Twitter for Taking Too Long to Reveal Trump's Tax Return 6:22 PM PDT 3/14/2017 by THR Staff Courtesy of NBC Rachel Maddow \"It takes less time to fill out your taxes than for Rachael Maddow to get to what's in Trump's taxes.\" \nRachel Maddow teased a big reveal on her Tuesday night show, tweeting earlier in the afternoon that she had gained access to President Donald Trump's tax returns. \nThe MSNBC host promised to release the returns on her show at 9 p.m. ET. \n\"BREAKING: We've got Trump tax returns,\" Maddow wrote, with the network even displaying a \"Trump Taxes Countdown Clock\" prior to the airing of her show. \nThe news got Twitter users abuzz about what she was planning to reveal. \nHowever, as Maddow started off her show talking about Trump's reasons for not releasing his taxes, and questioning \"cageyness\" around Michael Flynn and his ties to Turkey, along with Trump's questionable real estate deals, among many others topics, viewers began to get restless. \nEighteen minutes in, she said she'd get to the tax return \"next\"— and then cut to a commercial break. It takes less time to fill out your taxes than for Rachael Maddow to get to what's in Trump's taxes — Eric Stangel (@EricStangel) March 15, 2017 Guys, she's explaining why what's in the tax returns is news. The context is important! #maddow — Alana Russo (@alanarusso) March 15, 2017 Again, like the GOT ice thing, just one of you watch and tell the rest of us — Gilbert Cruz (@gilbertcruz) March 15, 2017 I love context, but this is about structure. Don’t bury the lede. It has always been a problem with Maddow’s show. OK, back to it... — Tim Goodman (@BastardMachine) March 15, 2017 Could you imagine if Rachel Maddow wrote the \"Star Wars\" opening crawls? — Frank Pallotta (@frankpallotta) March 15, 2017 My roommate was watching Rachel Maddow WAITING for her to tell us what's in Trump's tax returns. Me: She has an hour Him: Damn I'm bailing — Jonathan Riley (@JonRiley7) March 15, 2017 I just filed my 2016 taxes in the time it has taken @maddow to get to the point about Trump's 2005 return. — David Martosko (@dmartosko) March 15, 2017 #Editorial I'm already bored by Rachel Maddow's weak conspiracy hit-job on President Trump. pic.twitter.com/fZ48pNupai — The Columbia Bugle (@ColumbiaBugle) March 15, 2017 Livestream of #Maddow revealing Trump's taxes pic.twitter.com/rSgzslpeNB — Daniel José Older (@djolder) March 15, 2017 Twitter waiting for Rachel Maddow to talk about Trump's tax return right now like pic.twitter.com/oVIAhpi8rQ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:36:10.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
