Samsung Galaxy S8’s press render leaked, shows edge-to-edge display without any sign of a home button By - March 1, 2017 “The Galaxy S8’s latest render gives us the clearest look at its design till date” \nAs March 29th gets closer, barely a day goes by without a rumour about the Samsung Galaxy S8 surfacing on the interwebs. Just last week, a few live images of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ were leaked alongside their hands-on videos. Today, the popular tipster Evan Blass aka @ evleaks has treated us with our best look yet at the Galaxy S8. I think this is what you’ve been waiting for. pic.twitter.com/FvYfsLOy0R — Evan Blass (@evleaks) March 1, 2017 \nThe tipster has posted an alleged press render of the Samsung Galaxy S8. The render shows an illuminated front panel of a very sleek-looking phone. In line with the earlier leaks, the new image shows the phone with a clean, classic design and top-notch finishing. The phone appears to sport an edge-to-edge dual-edged display with narrow bezels on top and bottom.There’s no sign of a home button. On the top bezel, the handset appears to have an Iris scanner. \nThe press render shows March 29th as the date on the display, which is the day the phone would go official. Unfortunately, the tipster hasn’t posted a photo of the back of the device. The Korean giant shared a teaser of the phone at its pre-MWC event in Barcelona last week, confirming its launch date.
