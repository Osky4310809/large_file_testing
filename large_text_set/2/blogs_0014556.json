McCain’s comments about President Trump. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 18 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLetter to the editor: \nHooray for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for his courageous and principled remarks last week. It’s a shame and an embarrassment for our country that the majority of Republicans in Congress do not demonstrate similar qualities, in response to behavior by the current administration that is all too reminiscent of Adolf Hitler. \nAndy Perkins; Brewster, Mass. \n’Twas nearly a decade ago that Sen. John McCain; \nMade a vice president pick that was quite inane. \nBut he has redeemed himself, with his strong defense of the press \nWhose credibility, Donald Trump seeks to drastically regress. \nAnd, compared with the president, even Sarah Palin has a Mensa brain. \nVin Morabito; Scranton, Pa. Policing the USA \nFacebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar: \nSen. John McCain should have retired a long time ago, about the same time he became a Democrat. \n— Gene Stensaker \nI dislike President Trump from the core, but I also dislike McCain’s pandering. \nThis imposter had his chance to man up to Trump before the election. Instead, he fell in step with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and didn’t withdraw support from Trump — even after his war record was attacked. That shows us what kind of ethical code McCain has. \nMcCain is not speaking for America; he’s trying to act like he is with the American people so he can ride the “anti-Trump wave” to gain favor. \n— Rick Cooper \nMcCain is irrelevant and jealous. A great example of why term limits are needed. Trump certainly has issues, but his brain is way more functional than many “lifers” in Congress. \n— Larry Gilbert Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lo6JUM NEVER MISS OUT Opinion Once you know the news, it’s time to understand it.
