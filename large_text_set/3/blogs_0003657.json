Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports \nThe Boston Red Sox have one of the best starting rotations in baseball, as long as everyone stays healthy. They might not even make it to Opening Day with full health, though. \nRed Sox pitcher David Price is dealing with elbow soreness, John Farrell told reporters Thursday at spring training. Price already had an MRI on the elbow and won’t make his first start of spring training which was scheduled for Sunday. \nThe extent of the injury is still unclear and perhaps unknown, but it sounds like there’s at least some long-term concern. \nJohn Farrell said elbow soreness more than in past and they are concerned \n— Jim Bowden (@JimBowden_ESPN) March 2, 2017 \nThe Red Sox planned to have Price make the Sunday start after he pitched in a sim game earlier in the week, which is when he started feeling discomfort, Farrell told reporters Thursday.

But with unanswered injury questions about Drew Pomeranz, Steven Wright and Eduardo Rodriguez, the Boston rotation — figured to be the strength of the club — now has a lot of obvious question marks. \nThis article first appeared on NESN.com and was syndicated with permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T21:13:50.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
