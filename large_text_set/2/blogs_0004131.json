It is a crazy league and there are 42 points to play for. \n\"There are crazy results and that is why we have to keep playing as we are.\" \nReal Madrid match at Celta postponed \nThe result condemned Southampton to a sixth loss in seven league games and left boss Claude Puel calling for defensive improvement. \n\"In the second half we had many chances but without the possibility to come back. We have the quality to play, to score, now we need to keep a clean sheet,\" he said. \n\"We have to correct this and find a clean sheet and find confidence about the situation. \n\"It is important to give confidence to the squad about the defensive chances; we can't replace the best defender in the Premier League,\" he added, referring to the expected absence of Virgil van Dijk for up to two months with an ankle injury.
