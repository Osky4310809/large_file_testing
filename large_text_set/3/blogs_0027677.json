compiles some of the more notable openings scattered throughout Los Angeles. Every week we'll be tackling new places to check out in various neighborhoods. Any new spots that we might've missed? Hit the tipline . \nMarch 22, 2017: Eagle Rock — SpireWorks , a specialist in the vertical spit-roasted meat sandwiches known as doner kebabs, has opened its sophomore effort in Eagle Rock. Like the flagship Westwood location , expect customizable sandwiches and globally-inspired toppings created by consulting chef Kuniko Yagi, formerly Hinoki and the Bird. 4945 Eagle Rock Blvd Ste B, Los Angeles \nHollywood —It’s interesting to follow the quick flips of Hollywood venues. Take ORA Hollywood , a new club serving something that resembles Asian fusion fare. We here at Eater LA first wrote about the space back in 2010 when the club that was once known as Central was being reconcepted into the Spanish-themed Premiere. Five years later, Premiere becomes Toros Locos , and now, just one year later, it’s ORA . Let’s take bets on how long this one will last. 1710 N Las Palmas Ave, Los Angeles \nDowntown — An under-the-radar Japanese stunner has opened on Broadway thanks to Kai Japanese Roots . With a gorgeous design and executive chef Miki Fujita who cut his teeth in Japan, it should be a welcome new addition to Downtown for sushi and small plates. 542 S Broadway, Los Angeles \nHollywood Hills — 161st Street Pizza on Cahuenga has gone under new management. That means hopefully improved New York-style slices for local delivery needs. Order the egg gondola pizza if you’re feeling adventurous. 3252 Cahuenga Blvd W, Los Angeles \nHollywood — We don’t often hear of new Peruvian restaurants opening in LA. Breaking the mold is Mamacita , a hip new fast-casual eatery in Hollywood and Highland. Expect quinoa bowls, wraps, a kombucha bar, and purple corn chicha. 6801 Hollywood Blvd Ste 418, Los Angeles \nMarch 15, 2017: Melrose — A new coffee shop by husband and wife duo Mike Khorosh and Alexandra Dickison has opened on Melrose between La Brea and Fairfax. Toasted and Roasted is a customized experience, with guests first selecting from a choice of fair-trade coffee beans before choosing a brewing method with options that range from pour-over to a state-of-the-art Steampunk coffee system. There’s also “waffle puff” sandwiches and salads for all the coffee-shop warriors out there. 7311 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles \nDowntown— Crepe lovers, rejoice. Crepes De Paris has set up shop in Bunker Hill . Beyond sweet and savory varieties of the French specialty, the eatery also offers sandwiches, coffered ceilings, and adorable decor. 123 S Figueroa St, Los Angeles \nVan Nuys — It’s happened. A restaurant dedicated to modern slang has opened, thanks to OMGarnachas . The menu features “BFF Burritos,” “WTFruit,” and “#Totes Tacos,” and “BTW Aguas Frescas.” No words. 13714 1/2 Sherman Way Blvd, Los Angeles \nKoreatown — There may be no more rapidly developing restaurant neighborhood than Koreatown. One of this week’s new eateries is Ktown Pho , a Vietnamese restaurant serving a selection of nem nuong, banh mi, pho, and rice and noodle dishes from a Korean-translated menu. 974 S Western Ave, Los Angeles \nKoreatown — If you haven’t had suh lung tang, you’re missing out. The Korean beef soup has served as a hangover remedy well before bone broth ever became a thing. Giving places like Han Bat and Sun Nong Dan a run for their money is Chakan Sul Lung Tang . The restaurant claims to be LA’s only all natural grass-fed beef sul lung tang without any MSG, which means it’s something like the Korean version of Phorage. 543 S Western Ave, Los Angeles \nMarch 9, 2017: \nDowntown — You may have seen a new ramen shop flood your Instagram these days thanks to the newly opened DTLA Ramen . If the name sounds familiar, it may be because we here at Eater reported back in December that the concept would be taking over the former Alma space. That’s quite a departure from the fine dining nature of the former tenant. On offer are $10 bowls of spicy miso, shoyu, tsukemen, tonkotsu, and vegan ramen. Rounding out the experience is a selection of appetizers and even beer and sake. 952 S Broadway St, Los Angeles \nNorth Hollywood — The unbelievable number of poke shops in the City of Angels apparently isn’t inhibiting restaurateurs from opening up event more fast casual r aw fish specialists. Poke Bar is chief among the rapidly expanding chains, this time bringing their build-your-own poke bowls to the Valley. 11114 West Magnolia Blvd, Los Angeles \nTarzana — Low-key empire builder Blu Jam Cafe has opened yet another location in the Los Angeles area, this time in Tarzana. The breakfast-loving eatery known for its long lines and crunchy French toast already has outlets in Beverly Grove, Sherman Oaks, and Woodland Hills . 18700 Ventura Blvd Ste 140, Los Angeles \nWest Hollywood — Taco Love, the San Diego-style taqueria, has shuttered on the Sunset Boulevard stretch of West Hollywood. Taking its place is Tacos Way , a very similar concept that is the sixth location of a taco chain largely based in the Valley. 7980 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles \nGlendale — Glendale has no shortage of fantastic Mediterranean cuisine. Adding to the mix is Tarme Mediterranean Grill , a fast casual eatery that focuses on all-natural ingredients. As you could probably guess, the name of the game is shawarma plates, kabobs, and wraps. 744 S Glendale Ave, Glendale \nMarch 1, 2017: Downtown — Tucked away in one of Downtown’s newest hotels is the aptly named Tuck Hotel Restaurant and Bar . The brainchild of hotel proprietor Juan Pablo Torre, the all-day brunch restaurant has Spanish flair , which means you can start your day with tortilla de patata (Spanish potato omelette), quinoa tabouleh salad, and pancetta breakfast sandwiches. 820 S Spring St, Los Angeles \nSouth LA — American Deli , a chain with over 130 locations primarily in the South , has opened on W Slauson in Harvard Park. On offer are, not surprisingly, tried and true American staples, that is chicken wings, burgers, subs, and apparently friend rice and gyros, too. 1600 W Slauson Ave, Los Angeles \nWest LA — Late last year, we here at Eater LA reported signage for a rather interesting mash-up concept: pizza and macarons. Well now the eatery , dubbed The Pizza Mac , has finally opened its doors, with a full roster of the French cookies alongside a build-your-own pizza menu. The head-scratching doesn’t stop there, as one of the four sauce options is blackberry jam, which, according to the menu, is “sweet and tangy for the sweet tooth’s.” 2029 Westwood Blvd, Los Angeles \nTujunga — Corner Grill , an Asian fusion counter-service restaurant , has opened in Tujunga. On offer are Korean and Japanese-ish dishes like Korean BBQ burgers, teriyaki bowls, and yakisoba, served from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily. 6585 Foothill Blvd, Los Angeles \nSawtelle— In a surprise to absolutely no one at all, a new Japanese restaurant is now serving around Sawtelle. Anzu Japanese Gourmet has a more fusion take on the cuisine , offering rice dishes, karaage burgers, and teriyaki dogs in rather sleek surrounds. 11270 La Grange Ave, Los Angeles \nFebruary 22, 2017: Sherman Oaks — If you happened to drive along Ventura Boulevard this weekend, you may have noticed quite a long line outside of Donny’s Breakfast Spot , what looks like the Valley’s latest breakfast obsession . The name of the game here is home-style Southern comfort food, which means a menu full of gut-busting favorites like chicken and waffles, fried catfish and grits, and more traditional egg plates. 13701 Ventura Blvd, Los Angeles \nBoyle Heights — Chinese takeout spot Tong Sing closed at the end of last year. Taking over is Wok on Soto , another American Chinese spot with takeout and delivery at the forefront of the business. Expect the classics , that is sweet and sour chicken, broccoli beef, and lots of noodles to go around. Lunch specials are just under seven bucks. 305 N Soto St, Los Angeles \nLittle Tokyo — Have you tried Japanese-Italian fusion yet? PASTA e PASTA by Allegro is trying to make the style of cooking better known in Little Tokyo. Dishes like Mentai pasta, made up of a Japanese cream sauce with cod roe and mushrooms, and uni pasta sum of the concept quite well. The restaurant is open daily for lunch and dinner, but is closed on Mondays. 432 E 2nd St, Los Angeles \nWestlake — It has been quite some time since a new cold-pressed juicery has opened in LA. Breaking the dry spell is Drink Houz , a healthy eatery that focuses on probiotic drinks, juices, salads, and sandwiches. The beet latte is especially fun for coffee art lovers. 3231 W Temple St, Los Angeles \nThe Valley — It isn’t every day that we hear of a new Moroccan restaurant opening up in LA. Luckily for Valley denizens, Couscous Bowl is now open slinging their eponymous bowls with beef or veggies, merguez plates, and a variety of salads and sandwiches. 5424 Laurel Canyon Blvd, Los Angeles \nFebruary 16, 2017: Koreatown — Apparently Los Angeles still hasn’t reached maximum poke capacity , as a new fast casual concept, hndlgo , has opened in Koreatown Plaza. Beyond raw fish bowls, the counter also hawks salads, teriyaki, and dessert, all served in bowls. 928 S Western Ave Ste 132, Los Angeles \nEncino — Did you know that The Valley has a respectable cluster of Korean restaurants? The newest one has landed in Encino, dubbed House of Galbi . This barbecue spot boasts a full bar, which means it should be a solid option to get your #meatsweats on. 15927 Ventura Blvd, Los Angeles \nWestchester — If for some reason you don’t want In-N-Out before your LAX flight, there’s a new contender nearby, Unity LA . Located right in the Hyatt Regency LAX , the menu is divided in an interesting format—Boyle Heights, East LA, Pico Union, K-Town, Thai Town, and Little Tokyo. That means you can have your Asian and Mexican food before jetting off to cities that presumably have an inferior dining scene. 6225 West Century Blvd, Los Angeles \nEast Hollywood — Interestingly, it seems Korean restaurants are starting to spread outside of Koreatown . Located a block from the Santa Monica/Vermont Red Line station in East Hollywood is Nabi , a casual Korean spot that offers bibimbap bowls, barbecue pork tortas, and kimchi grilled cheeses. 4632 Santa Monica Blvd Ste 16, Los Angeles \nDowntown — It isn’t always easy to find Turkish coffee in LA. Now the Downtown office crowd can get their highly caffeinated fix at Strada Eateria & Coffee . Located in the King Edward Hotel, the restaurant and coffee shop has an interesting menu with everything from charcuterie plates to sandwiches to small bites like mojama , sun-dried tuna with tomato on sourdough. 119 E 5th St, Los Angeles \nFebruary 8, 2017: Koreatown — With a new restaurant opening nearly every week, is Koreatown the most rapidly developing restaurant neighborhood in all of Los Angeles? This week’s entrant is Chashu Ramen & Bowl , a Japanese eatery that has everything from ramen to poke bowls to tempura. 2500 W 8th St Ste 108, Los Angeles \nPico-Roberston — Oasis Mediterranean Cuisine has added a solid Mediterranean option to La Cienega. In addition to a variety of mezze and kabobs, you’re going to want to order the house special mixed grills. Because who doesn’t need their grilled meats to be served on a gleaming gold tabletop grill . 1663 South La Cienega Blvd, Los Angeles \nExposition Park — Los Angeles sure does loves its fried chicken. Now USC students and museum visitors have a new place for fried poultry in the form of the aptly named Chicken Factory . This straightforward spot offers fried chicken, wings, and sandwiches in Korean BBQ and other varieties. 3844 S Figueroa St, Los Angeles \nHollywood — Located in a strip mall on Vine and Melrose is Taqueria Tapatio , a casual counter-service spot for your burrito and taco fix from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., daily. 720 Vine St, Los Angeles \nHollywood — Taking over the former Soy Sauce Roll & Bowl is another casual sushi take-out spot , this time dubbed Yuki Sushi . With a menu of affordable rolls, poke, and teriyaki bowls, it should be a convenient stop for locals to get their Japanese fix. 7131 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles \nFebruary 2, 2017: Downtown — A “Neo-Pueblo” concept has entered the corner of 8 th and Main Downtown in the form of Wild Living Foods . This plant-based eatery by husband and wife duo Richard Torres and Lizbeth Sanchez is an all-day sort of place, which means you can take in the restaurant’s clean-eating ethos from breakfast to dinner, daily. Start off with an activated smoothie and chia pudding before noshing on quinoa bowls and medicinal herb salads. Is there a wide variety of cold pressed juices? You didn’t need to ask. 760 Main St., Los Angeles \nEast Hollywood — There may be no cuter tea shop in LA right now than Trinnie’s Bubble Tea . The Sunset Boulevard shop has cotton candy-topped milk tea, outdoor seating, and the most adorable neon sign . 5173 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles \nThe Valley — Yet another Mediterranean restaurant has opened in the Valley. This time it’s Eat Meat Kosher , a restaurant that unsurprisingly serves Kosher fare in the form of shakshuka, falafel, and plenty of shawarma. 14845 Burbank Blvd, Los Angeles \nInglewood — A convenient stop for those on their way to The Forum is El Limon . This casual spot offers a clean aesthetic and a menu that spans from your morning breakfast burrito to evening tacos and burritos. 902 N La Brea Ave, Inglewood \nKoreatown — Korean barbecue isn’t limited to grilled meats, as some K-town restaurants reserve their grills for seafood. One such restaurant was the longstanding Jaebudo 2, which has just come out from under a remodel to become DaeBuDo . This is a spot for everything from hagfish to eel to lobster grilled right on your table. 3916 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles \nJanuary 25, 2017: South LA — Brothers Cary and Duane Earle have been a longstanding fixture on Crenshaw Boulevard. The duo most recently served their wares out of a cart after having to relocate their original hot dog stand due to Metro line construction. Well now the shiny new brick and mortar location of Earle’s has arrived with turkey dogs, spicy beef links, chili, and even vegan options. 3864 Crenshaw Blvd, Los Angeles \nKoreatown — A temple of all things chicken has opened in Koreatown’s Chapman Plaza. Dong Dae Moon Dakhanmari , the first LA location of a popular restaurant in the Dong Dae Moon neighborhood of Seoul, is the place for dakhanmari , which translates to one whole chicken. Here the bird is cooked in a broth with rice cakes and vegetables for a meal that sounds especially soothing. 3465 W 6th St Ste 50, Los Angeles \nNorth Hollywood — Coffee For Breakfast , a Venezuelan breakfast and lunch spot , has opened on Burbank in North Hollywood. The fantastic menu includes Venezuelan breakfast plates with arepas and a choice of meat, cachapas or corn pancakes, and condensed milk-sweetend cups of joe. 11482 Burbank Blvd, Los Angeles \nNorth Hollywood — Also setting up shop in North Hollywood is Bobarrito . If you couldn’t guess, this retailer specializes in boba and sushi burritos . Yup that trend is still trying to become a thing in LA. Here you can have your poke as a burrito, bowl, taco, or nachos. 5233 Vineland Ave, Los Angeles \nBurbank — A quaint new coffee shop has opened in Burbank, dubbed Basecamp . The adorable shop boasts adorable shabby chic digs, breakfast burritos, and plenty of caffeinated beverages to keep you going all day long. 1221 West Riverside Dr, Burbank \nJanuary 18, 2017: Sherman Oaks — Despite it’s name, The Valley’s new Let’s Pho doesn’t just offer the noodle soup and other Vietnamese dishes, but also slings an extensive menu of Thai dishes as well. The former Goldie’s has been revamped , offering a hip interior with a coffered ceiling, checkered tiles, and plenty of communal seating. 4344 Woodman Ave, Los Angeles \nSilver Lake— The Forage team’s highly anticipated follow up Wolfdown has finally landed. Taking over the former Nicky D’s Pizza on Rowena, Wolfdown offers an unbearably quaint patio, beer and wine, and an Asian-influenced menu that includes dishes like stir-fried ramen with crab and uni, Korean fried chicken, and pork shoulder kare kare. 2764 Rowena Ave, Los Angeles \nKoreatown — It seems that Koreatown can’t get enough watering holes, as a new contender, Tok , has opened on Wilshire. Drinking is the name of the game here, with affordably priced soju and beer, and Korean fried foods to soak it all up. 3807 Wilshire Blvd Ste 120, Los Angeles \nHollywood — Although it was slated to open in December , chain eatery Farmer Boys has just opened on Hollywood Boulevard. The counter-service restaurant offers burgers, salads, and breakfast options. 5519 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles \nDowntown — There’s a new creperie in town thanks to Cafe Crepe, located in Union Station.
