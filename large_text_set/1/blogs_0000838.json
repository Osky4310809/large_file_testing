Flipkart exchange offer lets you buy the iPhone 6 for Rs 10,000, with a ridiculous caveat By - January 4, 2017 “To get the iPhone 6 for Rs 10,000, you will need to exchange an iPhone 6s Plus” \nAfter offering a discount of Rs 3,000 on the Apple iPhone 6 16GB in November, Flipkart is back with another offer on the device. The 16GB Space Grey variant of the iPhone 6 is available on the e-tailer for Rs 31,990, down from the usual Rs 35,990 price mentioned on the website. \nThere’s also an exchange offer of up to Rs 22,000. However, to get the maximum value of this offer, you will need to exchange an iPhone 6s Plus , which doesn’t make any sense. With the exchange offer, you can get the iPhone 6 for as low as Rs 10,040. The e-tailer is also offering extra five percent off on the purchases made via Axis Bank Buzz credit cards. \nFor a recap on the features, the iPhone 6 ( review ) sports a 4.7-inch Retina display, and is powered by an Apple A8 chipset, mated to an M8 Motion Co-processor and 1GB of RAM. It comes with an 8MP rear snapper, a 1.2MP front shooter, and iOS 10.Get the deal – Flipkart", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T13:17:47.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
