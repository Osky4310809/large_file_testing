Who is HR McMaster, Donald Trump's new national security advisor \nThere is some echoes of what happened then in current days: the animosity shown towards the media by Mr Trump was also present in the White House during Vietnam -- albeit in nothing like the current poisonous extent --- with both Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon blaming newspapers and television for undermining the war effort. \nGen McMaster’s firm conclusion was “the war in Vietnam was not lost in the front pages of the New York Times or the college campus. It was lost in Washington D.C. \nThe Vietnam indictment came in a book ‘Dereliction of Duty’, initially written as a Phd thesis, which got the attention of the best and the brightest of America’s military men. \nOne of them was General David Petraeus, who helped secure Gen McMaster promotion in face of opposition from conservatives in the military establishment. \nAfter the National Security Advisor appointment Gen Petraeus wanted to stress “HR McMaster is a brilliant officer, a battlefield hero and a true soldier-scholar who will serve President Trump and his country exceedingly well.” The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion \nProtesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March Getty 2/10 Trump and abortion \nUS President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House Getty Images 3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' \nNancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.

Trump announces new Gen HR McMaster as National Security Adviser \nBut this view had already been taken by the first person approached for the post after Lieutenant General Michael Flynn became its shortest holder in American history following his improper liaison with the Russian ambassador to Washington. \nVice Admiral Robert Harward turned down the job, --one he described to friends as a “shit sandwich” --- after being told that he would not be able to bring in his own team. \nOne person Admiral Harward is said to have wanted to get rid of was KT McFarland, who would have been his second in command, a former Fox News security commentator who had been accused of Islamophobia and someone who has shown a firm belief in conspiracy theories. \nBut the real elephant in the room, say military and intelligence officials, is Steve Bannon, the standard bearer for the hard -right who is the White House chief strategist and who Mr Trump has given a place in the National Security Council --- an unprecedented move for someone in that role. InsideGov | Graphiq \nTo add to the wonderment, Mr Bannon, it was decreed, would be a regular attendee while the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the armed forces and the Director of National Intelligence will be allowed to participate only \"where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\" \nEliot Cohen, who was counsellor to Condoleeza Rice when she was Secretary of State, said he fully understood how Admiral Harward and Gen Petreaus felt. \"No sane person would take this extremely important and difficult job without (a) control of staffing, and (b) eliminating or neutering Bannon's shadow NSC staff. Without those things you're doomed not to frustration, but failure”, he said. “ \nThe question will be whether Trump can bring himself to accept that, or go looking for a mediocrity — who will, in turn, help facilitate more failure.\" Trump admits to relationship with Putin in resurfaced video \nMr Cohen spoke before Gen McMaster took the job, and he certainly would not call the General a mediocrity. \nThe question now, however, is whether the General, a man who values integrity and independence, sometimes at a cost to his own career, would last in the administration. \nGen Mc Master has said of the military command :“We need leaders who have physical and mental courage on the battlefield, but also the courage to speak their minds and offer respectful and candid feedback to their superiors. \n\"Our leaders can’t feel compelled to tell their bosses what they want to hear.” \nThe General also spoke about failure of leadership: “ I think there are usually four causes of breakdowns in moral character --- ignorance, uncertainty, fear or combat trauma”. \nCritics of Mr Trump in the military point out that he, having made sure that he never heard a shot fired in anger, cannot blame the last factor if his presidency unravels.
