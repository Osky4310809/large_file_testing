They will introduce you to new ways of thinking and viewing the world. \nBecause they are such creative thinkers, having a Pisces in your life is like gaining a key to so many new, imaginative worlds. They place high value on things like art, literature, and love having deep, philosophical discussions. You can count on always learning something interesting when you’re spending time with a Pisces.\n2. They are truly empathetic and usually able to pick up on subtle emotional changes in you. \nPisces are very, very kind. When dating a Pisces, they quickly tune into your emotional (and physical) needs in ways you might not even be aware of. Even if they can’t directly relate to something you’re going through, they will always try to understand and offer whatever help they can. They are natural caregivers and this loving nature makes them lovely partners to have.\n3. Pleasing you is a huge turn on for them. \nLike mentioned in the previous point, Pisces are pretty skilled at knowing how you’re doing. Knowing you are being satisfied (and you can take that how you’d like!) is one of their favorite feelings. They genuinely enjoy pleasing their partner and won’t stop until you’re, uh, well, fully pleased.\n4. They are hugely romantic and enjoy making you feel special. \nYou haven’t really experienced romance until you’ve dated a Pisces. Love is a huge priority for them and strive to make their significant other feel appreciated. A Pisces is likely to tailor a one-of-a-kind date that caters to the things you like. They’ll remember something you mentioned months ago and make a note of it, surprising you with it one Saturday night.\n5. They ooze sensuality. \nThere’s something undeniable about a Pisces. It’s hard to pinpoint what exactly it is. Maybe it’s the way they carry themselves, or the way they touch, or the way they speak. Whatever it is, it’s intoxicating. Being seduced by a Pisces is an other-worldly experience.\n6. They’re usually down for sexual fantasy role-play. \nIf that’s not your thing, no harm, no foul. But Pisces love playing out scenarios and fantasies. Their creativity really shows itself in this arena and if you’re open to it, it can be one of the most illuminating and enjoyable experiences of your life.\n7. They’re not afraid to commit to you. \nThey love with zero hesitations and don’t get caught up in playing silly games. They are emotional, sure, but always with the purest intentions. Their vulnerability is absolutely a strength and never fear sharing that with someone they care about. You’ll never second guess how a Pisces feels about you. They’ll let you know.\n8. They’re playful and affectionate. \nThough they are deep feelers, they also know how to lighten up and be playful. They enjoy being goofy and spending hours together in the morning just snuggling, talking about absurd ideas or funny stories. When they laugh, it’s insanely contagious and you’ll find yourself smiley throughout the day.\n9. Selfless is their middle name. \nA Pisces will try to move mountains for you. Seriously. They are always putting others before themselves and will do whatever they can to make sure you are happy and thriving. Remind them it’s okay to be a little selfish sometimes, but also enjoy how genuinely they enjoy giving. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:01:21.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
