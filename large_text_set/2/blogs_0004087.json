And the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons were nowhere to be found. \nSimone Biles , the 4'8\" 19-year-old gymnast who competed with the gold medal-winning \"Final Five\" at the 2016 Summer Olympics, came face-to-torso with 7'1\" NBA legend and sports TV personality Shaquille O'Neal , 44, Sunday at Houston's NRG Stadium, hours before the NFL championship. \nHe had strolled through the room while she was talking to E! News' Jimmy Chairman and Miriam Isa and the two stars then met for the first time and took an iconic photo together. \n\"Hey Shaq,\" she wrote on Instagram . Photos Larry Busacca/Getty Images for DIRECTV \nBiles and Shaq had attended different pre-Super Bowl LI parties over the weekend. \nHe was spotted Saturday night at the Fanatics bash at the Ballroom at Bayou Place while she hung out with friend and fellow Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman , as well as John Legend , at the 2017 DIRECTV NOW Super Saturday Night Concert at Club Nomadic, where Taylor Swift performed . \nLegend attended the bash with wife and model Chrissy Teigen .
