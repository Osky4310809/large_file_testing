Sometimes I want to share my enthusiasm with my players, my staff and also the fans. It's normal. We are not in the same way. But for me the most important thing is to try and win, and then think about another celebration.” \nMourinho has since accused his former club of playing boring, defensive football as they opened up a 10-point lead at the top of the table. \nThe Italian insisted he will not indulge in pre-match mind games – but then insisted Manchester United have a better squad than Chelsea.
