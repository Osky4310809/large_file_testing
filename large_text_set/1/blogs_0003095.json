[13] As the finale of the movie premiered at the Pro-bending Arena, Pabu was seated in his private loge with Naga, both painted to resemble their mover characters, Juji and Roh-Tan, respectively. When Team Avatar relocated to the Southern Water Tribe in an effort to stop Unalaq before Harmonic Convergence occurred, Pabu accompanied them there, where he and Naga were left at the Southern Water Tribe compound while Team Avatar, Bumi , Kya , and Tenzin left for the South Pole . However, Pabu took off after them with Naga, and they found Bumi, who had gotten separated. He accompanied him to the South Pole, were Pabu remained seated atop Naga's head while the polar bear dog overpowered Desna and Eska, helping Bumi free the others. Pabu was subsequently taken back to the compound by Asami on Oogi, while the others ventured into the Spirit World . [14] In Ba Sing Se Pabu's presence in Ba Sing Se alarmed Grand Secretariat Gun , who urged Bolin to hide the fire ferret as the Earth Queen disliked having animals in her presence. \nPabu stayed with Bolin on Air Temple Island after the brother's apartment became overgrown with spirit vines, where he had a good time hanging out with Naga and playing with the airbending children. [15] The ferret later accompanied his master on his quest to locate new airbenders as a result of Harmonic Convergence and attempted to cheer him up when they failed to recruit anybody to rebuild the Air Nation. [16] \nWhen the party arrived at Ba Sing Se , Grand Secretariat Gun immediately noticed Pabu, Naga, and Oogi, and instructed Team Avatar to hide the animals due to Earth Queen Hou-Ting 's hatred of them. Bolin immediately resolved to tuck Pabu within his shirt, but remarked the other two animals as \"tougher [to hide]\". Pabu was left behind when Bolin and Mako set out to locate and retrieve Kai , their first recruit. [17] \nPabu was the first to notice Bolin and Mako returning from their stay in the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se. When the Earth Queen arrived, he hid inside Bolin's shirt, though complained about the sweatiness since the earthbender had been running. However, the Earth Queen began to sneeze as a result of Pabu's presence, prompting Bolin to flee the scene. Later, when Pabu had to hide again, the ferret protested against having to hide in Bolin's shirt once more, though reluctantly agreed to it, after Bolin emphasized that he was not sweaty that time. [18] In Zaofu Pabu remained on the airship with Lin and Naga . \nWhile Team Avatar was taking a break from their journey for more airbenders, Pabu rested on Bolin's shoulders and watched Korra playing fetch with Naga before joining the group back on Lin's police airship to head to Zaofu , pursuing a report of another airbender. Just as the team was beginning to leave the ship, Pabu sat on Naga's head as Lin angrily refused to join the rest, causing both of them to look curiously at the police chief. The animals later watched as the group brought Suyin Beifong aboard the ship to reunite with Lin and joined the group as Suyin led them to her estate to introduce them to her family. [19] \nPabu was perched on Bolin's shoulders again as he tried to spy on Korra and Suyin's metalbending training session, but when they were caught, Bolin tried to use the fire ferret as an excuse to get out the sighting, first claiming he was missing, followed by saying he bit the earthbender and there was venom in his bite. Pabu remained in the same spot as they went to Suyin again later when Bolin decided he wanted to learn metalbending, but was left to watch as Suyin and Lin fought. [20] Pabu discovered Korra had been kidnapped by the Red Lotus and alerted Bolin to their presence. \nSometime later, Pabu awoke in the middle of the night and spotted the Red Lotus infiltrating the estate. He squealed and scratch at the window, but by the time Bolin awoke, the gang had passed, and the ferret was told to go to sleep. However, Pabu soon caught the criminals passing by again with a sedated Korra. He jumped on his owner's stomach to try and alert him again before going over to the window; this time he was able to get there before Zaheer 's gang was out of sight. He waited in the brothers' room as they worked to stop the criminals. \nA day later, when Team Avatar searched around the battle site, Pabu perched himself on Bolin's shoulders, but ran off when he saw Varrick getting his feet rubbed with pumice stones. [21] At the Misty Palms Oasis Edit While playing with a Nuktuk doll, Pabu accidentally disrupted a Pai Sho game between Bolin and Asami , robbing the earthbender of his imminent victory. \nAfter the team tracked the traitor Aiwei to the Misty Palms Oasis , Pabu and Naga waited outside the Misty Palms Inn , the fire ferret playing with the spirits. He later rested on Naga in the group's cramped room though ended up accidentally ruining a Pai Sho game between Bolin and Asami that his owner was about to win by jumping on the game board and sending the pieces flying. While Bolin moaned at his near victory, Pabu chewed the head off the Nuktuk doll made by Lily . After the team relocated to Aiwei's room, Pabu leisurely rested between Naga's paws until Mako sent the polar bear dog away with Korra and Asami in order to escape Ghazan and Ming-Hua . When a fight broke out between Mako and Bolin and the two Red Lotus members, Pabu remained out of sight and undetected in Aiwei's room. [22] \nPabu eventually left Aiwei's room and met up with Naga, who had lost Asami and Korra to the Earth Queen's troops. The animals awaited the return of their masters at the abandoned jeeps, just outside of the town. When Lin arrived, Pabu excitedly jumped on her and started to circle her waist, though was soon grabbed by the neck and held at bay. He was placed atop Naga and offered some meat to keep quiet, which he gladly accepted. [23] \nUpon noticing Bolin's return to the Misty Palms Oasis, Pabu ran over to his master and promptly climbed on his shoulders. He was hugged and kissed in return, receiving the promise that he would never be let go again. [24] Pabu and Naga bowed their heads in shame after Yin expressed her disappointment in them for playing tug-of-war with Mako 's scarf. \nPabu traveled with the rest of the team back to Zaofu and was left their under the care of Yin while Team Avatar and their allies tried to save the Air Nation from the Red Lotus. While there, Pabu entered in a tug-of-war contest with Naga, using Mako's scarf, which now belonged to Yin, as the rope. However, as soon as the elderly woman discovered them, she sternly admonished them for their behavior, addressing Pabu as a \"rat thingy\". Upon hearing she was disappointed in them, the two animals bowed their heads in shame. [25] 174 AG Edit \nBy 174 AG, Pabu was left on Air Temple Island in the care of Tenzin's children, while Bolin joined Kuvira 's army in an attempt to bring unity to the Earth Kingdom. He resided on Ikki's shoulder while she attended the reopening of Republic City's Central City Station and later enjoyed being fed by Jinora at the dinner table back on the island. [26] \nWith Naga also residing on the island, Pabu had a his old playmate again. On the day Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo returned to Air Temple Island with Korra, Pabu was stalking the polar bear dog to hunt her tail. Pabu was taken along by Naga to great the returning group, as he was hanging from her tail, having bitten down on it. After Naga happily reunited with Korra, Pabu climbed atop her head. [27] Pabu and Bolin happily reunited after the latter deserted Kuvira 's army . \nSome time later, Pabu was playing in one of the many trees on Air Temple Island when Bolin called out to him. Poking his head out of the greenery, he chittered to make his presence known and readily jumped out of the tree to be caught by the earthbender in a warm embrace. After chittering an agreement to help Bolin win back Opal , the fire ferret ran up to her with a note tied around his neck and subsequently led her to the place where Bolin had allegedly broken both his legs, though was actually awaiting her to have a romantic picnic. Pabu rejoined his master on his shoulders and took a home-made steam bun out of a basket, before being tossed in the air by Bolin to do a backflip. Pabu was released from his grip when Opal snared at Bolin's attempt to a romantic picnic as if they were having no problems and started innocently eating his steam bun. As Opal retreated, she apologized to Pabu for letting the ferret see her outburst. [28] \nWhen Bolin acted as the minister during Varrick and Zhu Li 's wedding after Kuvira's attack on Republic City, Pabu, dressed in a suit, jumped on his shoulder to give him the couple's vows, which were written on a note tied around his neck. [29] Personality Edit \nPabu is a mischievous but friendly fire ferret. He has a strong bond with Bolin, accompanying him on most occasions and helping out wherever and whenever possible. He is generally affectionate to those whom Bolin considers his allies, as evidenced by him comforting Korra when she was sad, allowing Jinora to pet him, and his friendship with Naga. \nDespite being loyal to his master, Pabu is quite independent and can protest Bolin's requests, as evidenced when he refused to allow Bolin to bathe him and was dismayed when he was forced, [8] and when he was reluctant to hide inside Bolin's shirt. [18] Abilities Edit Pabu is proficient at acrobatic stunts. \nOn a number of occasions, Pabu has demonstrated himself to be very nimble and acrobatic, such as when he performed circus tricks on the street to help the Fire Ferrets raise money, [7] as well as at the Pro-bending Tournament final. He has also proven to have very sharp teeth capable of chewing through rope, as well as excellent swimming abilities.
