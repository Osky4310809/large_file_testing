Fierce competition is prompting firms to take unusual steps to bolster their profiles. Top firms are hiring groups of lawyers to expand specific practice areas, changing pay practices, jettisoning or demoting some partners and staff members and seeking ways to distinguish their brands to set them apart from competitors.\nBeyond that, the top-drawer firms are increasingly jostling with one another to win lucrative legal work. It is getting tougher for firms to hang onto traditional portfolios of corporate business and avoid elbowing from rivals.\n“It was a growth story in the 1990s, but since 2008, it’s a more competitive world where there is less growth,” said Jeffrey C. Hammes, the chairman of Kirkland & Ellis, a major Chicago-based firm with some 1,800 lawyers worldwide.\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story The traditional bonds of partnership, if not being undone, are at least being frayed by the rising numbers of partners leaving one big firm for another. Kirkland, for example, last fall brought aboard Paul D. Clement, a former United States solicitor general, and all 17 colleagues from the boutique appellate firm Bancroft P.L.L.C. The bold stroke gave Kirkland singular depth in a prestigious practice area, but may also have had unintended fallout.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Since that deal, announced in September, Kirkland’s latest overhaul of its partner compensation system — where average profits per partner are about $3.6 million, according to reports in legal publications — took what some see as a surprise twist. The revamp appeared to shift higher awards to lawyers who handle corporate work, the reports said, leaving some litigation partners to complain privately that their work was being undervalued. Mr. Hammes did not comment on the pay shift.\nIn the past, recruiting a superstar to jump to a new firm was rare, and a few top-of-the-line firms still avoid such hires on grounds that they undercut the profession’s image and damage morale. But unexpected moves like Mr. Clement’s hiring are becoming a new normal for law firm viability as firms poach illustrious lawyers in a quest to raise their profiles, and revenue, according to those who study the legal industry.\nSign Up for the DealBook Newsletter Every weekday, twice a day, get the news driving the markets and the latest on mergers and acquisitions.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Last year, Kevin Arquit, a business competition specialist, left Simpson Thacher & Bartlett to become head of an antitrust legal team at Weil Gotshal & Manges. He joined a former colleague, Steven Newborn. And Scott A. Barshay, one of the best-known mergers and acquisitions specialists , who had 25 years at the premier firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, jolted the legal community by leaving. His new home is another top-flight firm, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, with its leading merger and anti-activist shareholder practices, where he became its global head of mergers.\nA “strong distinct brand is vital to the most successful firms,” said Gretta Rusanow, the head of advisory services at Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group, which recently examined the performance of a group of about 50 large firms from 2010 to 2015.\nBeing the leading experts and trusted advisers “in a select number of practice areas and, increasingly, industry sectors enabled them to attract higher rates,” she said, “and higher rate increases as clients have been prepared to pay comparatively more for what they perceive as high-value legal advice.”\nMr. Barshay’s former employer, which reportedly paid him about $3.4 million annually, embraced the traditional “lock step” system of pay by seniority, designed to cement loyalty and camaraderie among partners. But Paul, Weiss and some other platinum firms offer higher pay because they tie compensation to the amount of legal business a partner generates for the firm.\nFirms are also increasing financial incentives for their lowest-ranked lawyers. Cravath, Swaine & Moore led a wave of firms in June to increase salaries of first-year associates to $180,000, but it did not raise year-end bonuses for associates from 2015 levels. Higher salaries come as corporate merger activity dropped 22 percent over the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters.\nLaw firm spending outstripped demand in the first three fourths of last year, according to an annual review by Citi and Hildebrandt Consulting. Expenses, including last summer’s junior lawyer pay raises, rose 3.4 percent while demand for law firm services grew a mere 0.3 percent. Law firms were able to offset that imbalance by charging higher rates, up some 3.2 percent, bringing overall growth through September to 3.7 percent.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Firm mergers are also expected to continue. To date most such mergers are among small and medium-size firms, but the combination in 2016 of the prestigious Arnold & Porter law firm, based in Washington, with the New York firm Kaye Scholer brought the prospect of consolidations more firmly into view.\nPhoto Paul D. Clement, a former United States solicitor general, moved last fall to Kirkland & Ellis from Bancroft P.L.L.C., a switch that may have had unintended fallout. Credit Carolyn Kaster/Getty Images “There will be more merger activity,” predicted John Cashman, a vice president at Major, Lindsey & Africa, a legal recruiter. Such combinations are not a snap, he warned, because “every firm wants to be the acquirer.”\nBut the eye-catching hirings and the firm combinations are being driven by the need to solidify critical practice groups. For Paul, Weiss, Mr. Barshay’s hiring enhanced one of the firm’s “key strategies,” which is investing in “our five core practice areas where we can credibly claim to be the market leader: litigation, regulatory/white collar defense, public mergers and acquisitions, private equity and restructuring,” said Brad S. Karp, its managing partner.\nMore than 50 percent of firm revenue — or some $600 million a year — is generated from its top 25 clients, he said.\nEven so, Mr. Karp noted that “law firms today must make a persuasive case for their retention.” The “new reality,” he said, “is marked by hypercompetition and bears little resemblance to the world even five to 10 years ago, and virtually no resemblance to the legal industry 20 years ago.”\nSome firms like Latham & Watkins emphasize their geographical diversity. Latham has 2,400 lawyers worldwide, offering cross-border advice on mergers, acquisitions, antitrust and regulatory issues. “We have analyzed where our clients have legal needs — you need to determine where there is demand for specific areas of expertise,” said William H. Voge, the firm’s global chairman and managing partner. “It is somewhat like what consultants and accountants have done, but Big Law is behind.”\nHis firm, Mr. Voge said, routinely competes for big-ticket legal work, with partners often flying from different parts of the world to showcase Latham’s skills against those of five or six competing firms. The cost is not cheap; the firm pays $30,000 to $70,000 per presentation.\nAnd it works, he said, because most of the firm’s existing clients last year each paid over $1 million in legal fees. Over all, the firm had profit of $1.6 billion in 2016, Mr. Voge noted.\n“For every mandate, you have to prove your talents,” said Mr. Voge, who operates out of London and visits more than 50 clients annually. “Our clients have the right to kick the tires.”", "external_links": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/10/business/10DB-LAWFIRM/10DB-LAWFIRM-master675.jpg", "http://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/kirkland-ellis-hires-paul-clement-viet-dinh-and-all-of-bancrofts-lawyers/", "http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202774960269/Top-Partners-at-Kirkland-amp-Ellis-See-Cuts-to-Equity-Shares", "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/10/business/10DB-LAWFIRM/10DB-LAWFIRM-superJumbo.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T10:05:39.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
