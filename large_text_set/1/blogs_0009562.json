Plus, The CW Renewed Crazy Ex-Girlfriend , Arrow & The Flash by Maddy Myers | 1:57 pm, January 8th, 2017 \nNo surprise here, but Supernatural has just been renewed for yet another season. Of course, we already knew that would happen, since this show will never die. Last year, when asked about how the show might end, series co-star Jared Padalecki said : “I don’t like to say, ‘When the show ends,’ because the show’s not going to end.” Does that sound ominous to anyone else? \nSpeaking of ominous, this will be Supernatural ‘s 13th season, and we all know what people say about the number 13. Perhaps the show’s writing staff will make this season into a particularly unlucky one for the Winchester boys, since Supernatural does have a habit of breaking the fourth wall. For all we know, they’ll directly acknowledge the number 13 within the show. \nThe CW has also renewed six other shows, several of which we’re excited to see continue, including Jane the Virgin and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend , the latter of which tops my personal list of favorites. If you haven’t yet watched the first and second season of that show, get to hopping, because it’s amazing. I’m thrilled to hear it’ll get a third season. \nThe other four shows that are going to get renewed are, of course, the stacked DC TV line-up: Arrow , The Flash , Supergirl and DC’s Legends of Tomorrow . Look forward to us continuing our recaps and open-thread sections on each of these during the 2017-2018 TV season! \n(via LA Times , image via Tumblr ) \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T10:07:34.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
