It became a journey of no return. \nIn his ruling Justice Omolaye-Ajileye said, “The facts of robbery in the case flows from the facts of established and already accepted by the court in respect of the second and third heads of charge. \n“With all the pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution: the exhumation of the bodies of Tanko and Mohammed from the compound of the accused, I hold that after poisoning the two brothers as the accused confessed, in his downright criminality, he hit their heads with pestle to hasten their annihilation. And in order to avoid any trace of his brutal and inhuman act,the accused buried the dead bodies of Tanko and Mohammed in his compound. Unfortunately since nothing is hidden under the sky, nemesis caught up with him.” \nThe judge added, “By your own word, after poisoning both Tanko and Mohammed and they refused to die, you used a pestle to hit them on their heads. That was a brutal homicide committed with determination and ruthlessness. The manner you committed it, by your own description, makes it a high level of exceptional wickedness that it can only be properly marked by death sentence, which the only sentence I can pass on you”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:20:01.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
