Over the past month, he’s been spotted with multiple models, including former WSHH Honey Rosee Divine and Swedish twins Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta . \nDrake cozying up with another model has set the rumor mill on fire yet again, although the “proof” about this one is potentially dubious. \nThe latest attempt to link Drake with a woman other than former fling Jennifer Lopez comes shortly after the Canadian superstar was spotted with model Winnie Harlow while at a club in London. \n“Jourdan Dunn and Adriana Lima were also at the bash but Drake only had eyes for Winnie … Winnie and Drake have always had a close friendship, with him even rapping about her on track ‘Know Yourself,’ but they looked particularly intimate on Saturday,” a source present at the club revealed to The Sun . \nBoth Toronto natives, Drake has known Harlow for a while and even gave his model pal a shoutout on the If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late track, “Know Yourself.” \n“Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and woah,” Drake raps on the song.

A post shared by Noah Shebib (@ovo40) on Apr 23, 2014 at 9:54am PDT \nWhich prompted a response from Harlow. \nIn an August 2015 interview with Complex , the model addressed her connection to Drake, explaining, “I’m friends with his producer, 40, so I met everyone through him. I’m just like, the little sister. They call me the ‘6 Goddess.'” Subscribe to DX Newsletter  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:37:42.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
