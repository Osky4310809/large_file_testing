Scholar Red, Lucid White and Concrete Grey \n\n\nschindlbeck gave the standard alphanumeric segment font a redesign, with an improved readability of numbers and mathematical symbols. the difficulty can also be adjusted to six different levels so it’s perfect for the classroom, or if you just fancy punishing yourself for skipping algebra that time. \nthe clock’s difficulty can be adjusted to six different levels \n\n\n‘at one point, I felt the need to discover something new and I was excited by the idea of developing independently my own ideas, through playful concepts that have a curious and positive hold on everyday life. it’s a true responsibility, and you just go from scratch to the final product on your own,’ says schindlbeck. mauclere helped him to put his idea into reality, writing the software and developing all electronic parts. ‘we had some experience together, but we still needed to discover the complexity and the odds of an industrial manufacturing process’. \na wall fixture allows simple mounted installation of the clock \n\n\nthe albert clock’s crowdfunding campaign ended in august 2015, and 1000 pieces have since been manufactured and distributed to private clients and schools in 37 countries worldwide. the design is also now available as an app , so each glance at your phone will present you with a new mathematical challenge. \nthe design was originally part of an initiative to create 50 designs in as many days \nthe PCB was custom designed by fred mauclere \nthe segment mask plastic injection piece gives the distinct shape of the albert clock font \ntest of diffuser film", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:58:41.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
