Unfortunately, the game’s music wasn’t able to authentically convey the synth sounds that were so popular during the era because of the limited technology of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Fortunately for us, one individual has taken it upon himself to recreate the Metroid soundtrack as it was always meant to be.\nA YouTuber by the name of Luminist began this project a few months ago. “I wanted to find out what the original NES Metroid soundtrack would be like if it was remade with REAL synths, 80s style,” said Luminist. “All sounds were generated with a Korg MS20 Mini, then processed with some juicy studio effects to make things more atmospheric.”\nAs you can see… er… hear from the video below, the result is quite amazing.\nWhen it comes to the music of the Metroid series, the conversation usually begins and ends with Super Metroid . This is understandable considering how that SNES classic has a soundtrack that has stood the test of time. The original game had great music as well, but as mentioned above, it was hampered because of the limited technology of the NES.\nThis remixed soundtrack gives the Metroid soundtrack the appropriate depth it deserves. Not only does the music fit the game perfectly, but it really does sound like something straight out of the 80’s. Even if you’ve never played or heard of Metroid , it would be easy for you to believe that these tracks were taken directly from an 80’s science fiction or horror film.\nBelow are some select pieces from this project. To hear the rest, make sure to head on over to Luminist’s YouTube channel and bask in synth-y goodness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T13:55:08.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
