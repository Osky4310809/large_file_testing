Imagine what “This Is Us” would do to me. \nStill, despite a show basically selling itself by saying “we’re gonna eff up your day,” fans tune in every week with a renewed dedication a broadcast TV show hasn’t seen since pre- Netflix . \nBut according to new research, becoming attached to TV characters is actually healthy. \nThe relationship we share with characters is called parasocial by psychologists — because we care and know about them, but they don’t know anything about us. (So, it seems like all my crushes are also parasocial relationships! Hahahahah I’m so sad.) \nAssistant professor of psychology at the University of Oklahoma, Jennifer Barnes, said, \nThe interesting thing is that our brains aren’t really built to distinguish between whether a relationship is real or fictional. So, these friendships can convey a lot of real-world benefits. \nThose sweet, sweet benies? Higher self-esteem, less loneliness and increased feelings of belonging. \nBut watching tragedies, despite making us sad, is cathartic. In fact, crying over a character on TV helps you get rid of negative emotions. \nBarnes said, \nIt gives us something to focus those negative emotions on and get them out of our system. \nPsychologists also think while we feel sad from watching our characters experience tragedy, we may experience “meta-emotions” where we’re happy we can feel that way over another person’s struggle. Barnes said, \nWe might actually feel glad that we can be empathetic and feel things like this on behalf of someone else, even if they’re not real. \nWatching TV dramas also helps you read people’s feelings better, and you’ll be kinder and more compassionate. \nBarnes adds, \nWe should make sure we’re also feeling just as much empathy for real people, including real people we don’t know. \nTO WHICH, I SAY POO-POO! I only care about my fictional friends. 5 Stages of Binge Watching Your Favorite TV Show [5TAGES]  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:56:18.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
