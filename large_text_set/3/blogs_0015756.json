Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA Ghanaian international footballer has been forced to deny he has a girlfriend after dropping a clanger during a hilarious post-match interview. \nMohammed Anas - who plays for South Africa's Free State Stars - was over the moon to receive the man-of-the-match award following his teams 2-2 draw with Ajax Cape Town on Friday. \nSo happy in fact, that he then went on to thank both his wife AND his girlfriend in a bizarre acceptance speech. \nAnas said, \"Thank you very much for giving me this. And I appreciate my fans, also my wife and my girlfriend...\" \nRealising his error, he made a quick attempt to correct himself, \"I mean my wife, sorry to say. I'm sorry, my wife.\" Mohammed Anas' acceptance speech has become a viral hit (Photo: @clydegoal/Twitter) \nThe video of the interview has become a viral hit, clocking up over 250,000 views on youtube as well as other social media sites, which Anas seemed pretty happy about, \n\"I'm famous now - people around the world know me,\" the footballer said. \nAnas has since tried to explain his gaff, \"My family knows that I call my daughter my girlfriend. That's what I was talking about. I don't have a girlfriend,\" he said. \nDespite potentially putting his foot in it, he said he was not worried about his wife's reaction, whom he has been with for 7 years, \n\"I love her so much. She's given me two beautiful children. She is fine. She knows what kind of man I am so I am not worried\". poll loading Is this the greatest man of the match interview of all time? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:36:10.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
