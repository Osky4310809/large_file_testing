REUTERS/Toby Melville Khalid Masood Named As London Westminster Terrorist TOP 5549916 \nLondon police named Khalid Masood as the perpetrator responsible for Wednesday’s attacks in Westminster, London, which left 5 dead, including Masood himself. \nMasood, 52, was reportedly known to police due to his previous criminal activity, but he was not under surveillance at the time of the attacks. The Islamic State took credit for Masood’s attack Thursday morning, though the exact nature of his connection to the terrorist organization is unclear. London police have arrested eight other individuals suspected of being involved with the attack. \n— Al Arabiya English (@AlArabiya_Eng) March 23, 2017 \nMasood was born in Kent, United Kingdom, and was living in the West Midlands near the city of Birmingham before the attack. \n“The man was British born and… some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism,” U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May told parliament Thursday. “He was not part of the current intelligence picture.” \nMasood used a car to run over several people on Westminster bridge. He later exited the vehicle and stabbed a policeman Keith Palmer to death near parliament before being shot to death by another officer. College worker Aysha Frade and Kurt Cochran, a U.S. tourist, were also among the dead. Approximately 40 others were injured. \nSend tips to [email protected] .
