A necropsy will be performed to determine the exact cause of death, and the zoo intends to double its security. \nNot surprisingly, news of the killing caused online shock and outrage. \n“Whoever did this has to pay,” Gigi Perla wrote in a tweet . “My heart goes out to you and your keepers; may you rest in peace. #Gustavito #ElSalvador”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:48:02.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
