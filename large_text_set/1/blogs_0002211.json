Innes is also in the process of adopting Smith’s daughters Tian, 11, and Lexie, 8.\nThe couple’s friends set up a GoFundMe to raise money for the expedited wedding , scheduled for February. In just a few days, the campaign has fundraised over $15,000 of the $18,500 goal (£15,000) and hundreds of people have donated. Area businesses have also offered up a venue, catering, an ice cream van, and a Ferris wheel.\n& Posted by Amy Smith on  Sunday, December 25, 2016 Smith was diagnosed with cancer after a year of shoulder pain including a dislocation. Her surgery removed part of a tumor and crushed three vertebrae, The Daily Mail reports. They also put in two metal rods in her spine for support.\n“There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now,” Smith told the Eastern Daily Press . “I am so honored, grateful and overwhelmed, so there are no words which would be enough to say thank you.”\nPeople are good, and love is real. Marriage is great and all, but ferris wheels? That’s something else.\nThe post People crowdfunded a wedding for a woman with cancer, which proves that love is alive and well appeared first on HelloGiggles .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T00:10:59.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
