Instagram \nGadot even worked a “Wonder Woman” shoutout into the announcement. \nShe wrote, \nAnd then we were four… She is here, Maya. I feel so complete blessed and thankful for all the Wonders in my life #family #newborn #grateful \nSee? Did you catch the capital “W” in Wonder? GET IT? \nAnyway. Gadot named her new daughter Maya, which, according to Baby Center is in the top 50 most popular baby names of 2017 already. It’s Latin for “great,” meaning young Maya here is destined for greatness, probably. \nBut with Wonder Woman for a mom, how can she not be? \nGadot has been married to Israeli real estate developer Yaron Versano since 2008. Their first daughter, Alma, was born in 2011, and is now 5 years old. Instagram \nOf course, in just a few months time, both of Gadot’s daughters will get to see their mom on the big screen as a literal superhero. \nLike, sure, every kid thinks their mom is Wonder Woman. But these kids really do have Wonder Woman as a mom, in every sense. \nAnd we’re not talking about just the old school Wonder Woman who fights crime in a skimpy outfit. Gadot’s Wonder Woman is a practical (though still very sexy) warrior.
