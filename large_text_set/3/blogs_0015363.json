E15, which premiered in Edinburgh last summer, focuses on the campaign launched in 2013 by twenty-nine vulnerable mothers who faced eviction from their hostel in the London borough of Newham. \nWriter Helen Monks, probably best known from her appearances in the sitcom Raised by Wolves , has collaborated with director Matt Woodhead, whose previous projects have included a verbatim drama about the Chilcot report. Together they have woven the Newham mothers' testimony and commentary on their case into a bracing 90-minute piece. \nSurrounded by banners bearing bold political messages, the cast of six at first seem intent on creating a carnival atmosphere. Soon the tone becomes more like a documentary, and we are bombarded with details — some familiar, others alarming — about the limitations of modern social housing. \nThe real-life E15 campaigners attracted high-profile supporters such as Russell Brand and managed to win huge attention for their plight. They also prompted valuable debate about the true costs of gentrification. But here we’re sharply reminded that the issues they addressed haven’t gone away.
