I wanted to tell the story to through the eyes of the child’s point of view, the love of a family, to show the beauty of the country and understand what Maddox’s parents may have gone through.” \nLoung was only five years old when the Khmer Rouge - Cambodia’s communist party - took control. Her memoirs recount what it was like to live during that era and see both her parents and two sisters executed. \nShe co-wrote the movie script with Angelina, who is a good friend.
