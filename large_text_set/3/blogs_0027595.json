According to an independent source, Italian buyers will pay €829 and €929 for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ respectively, which is €30 more than the Europe pricing Evan Blass provided a few days ago. \nAs for the colors of the upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+, the same source says that the Galaxy S8 will come in Arctic Silver, Black Sky, and Purple Violet colors, with the Galaxy S8+ offering the same three color options. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ model numbers SM-G950 and SM-G955 are expected. The Arctic Silver and Black Sky were revealed along with the new Orchid Gray option , but Samsung looks to make the Orchid Gray regional instead of worldwide. \nWe’ve wondered about the Purple Violet color and its worldwide availability since its photo poses , but the Italian market leaves us wondering if Samsung will release this or maintain its exclusivity in a few markets. This news answers the question for Italy, but as for other markets, not so much. It could have the same restricted fate as the Orchid Gray color option. The press shot showcasing a Gold Galaxy S8 is still a question mark, too. \nThe Galaxy S6 edge for Italy was priced at €889 for the 32GB and €999 for the 64GB storage models. For comparison, the Galaxy S4 for Italy was €600-650 , so between the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S6, Samsung’s smartphones have risen a bit in price. Of course, Samsung has traded in its plastic design for premium glass and metal, and looks to double the internal storage in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus as compared to the 32GB base storage for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge from last year; the S8′s internal storage will be four times greater than that of the 16GB base storage in the Galaxy S4 launched four years ago. \nUSB Type-C charging and fast wireless charging are also part of the package, so some would say the high-end price matches the high-end experience. \nItaly customers, what do you think of these prices?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:15:49.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
