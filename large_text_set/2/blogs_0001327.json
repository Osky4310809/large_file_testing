Well no. And because of this, breeders pump them out in spades, drawing on people’s love of baby animals to generate a profit. The result? Too many dogs. Yes, you can have too much of a good thing when there aren’t enough resources to house all of the pups who can’t find homes. \nWe rely on community shelters to care for these animals and find them good homes, but we sometimes fail to remember that these organizations are limited by inadequate funding and space. Their kennels are packed, and yet more animals arrive daily, either picked up off the streets by animal control or surrendered by the owners they loved and trusted. \nMany of these dogs are not designer breeds . Many are Pit Bulls who inherit a terrible reputation through no fault of their own. And so, many find themselves stuck at shelters, overlooked and depressed, wishing for a forever home that may never arrive. \nIn order to accommodate the continuous string of new arrivals, shelters often feel forced to pick and choose and make room for those dogs that appear to be more “adoptable.” Those that don’t fit that bill may not live to see another day, as 5,500 dogs are euthanized by shelters in the United States every single day … 2.7 million each year! For dogs like Sheeba, who was found badly injured with a broken leg and in need of expensive orthopedic surgery, the outlook wasn’t good. \n\nLuckily, the kind folks at S.N.A.R.R Animal Rescue saved this girl from certain death and are willing to give her all the time she needs to find the right home. On Facebook, S.N.A.R.R writes , “Broken is the only word I can think of when I see this picture. Sheeba looks defeated. She is sitting in a high kill shelter with a bad injury and break of her left leg; a tough rescue because orthopedic surgeries are so expensive. Could SNARR NE take her? The shelter [where Sheeba was held] has been trying everyone and nobody has said yes. Well…we said YES! Welcome to SNARR Sheeba.” \nNo-kill rescue organizations can only continue to save needy dogs and give them a second chance at finding a forever home with the help of people like you. All dogs deserve to be so lucky, and we can make it happen by: Supporting no-kill shelters like S.N.A.R.R Animal Rescue Volunteering to help care for and network adoptable dogs Adopting a shelter dog like Sheeba, or Sue , or Hercules , or Tina P. , or Benny , or Chester , or Cher Sharing this information to encourage others to adopt, too \nIn addition, encourage everyone you know and meet to spay or neuter their pets so that we can ensure fewer homeless pets and work to become a no-kill nation for dogs and cats. \nImage source: S.N.A.R.R Animal Rescue / Facebook Want to read more posts like this?
