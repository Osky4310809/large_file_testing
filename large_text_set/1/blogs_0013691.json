The This Is Us actress wore a patchwork dress from Marc Jacobs’ Resort 2017 collection to Elle ‘s annual Women in Television celebration in Los Angeles this week, and she gave us major Holly Hobbie vibes .\nWhile you may think of neon, off-the-shoulder sweatshirts, and high-cut leotards as quintessential ’80s attire , Moore’s outfit is proof that a more hippie-chic brand of ’80s fashion is coming back into vogue in 2017, and we’re not mad about it.\nCheck out the frock below and see how Moore channeled her inner ’80s girl.\nJonathan Leibson/Getty Images for ELLE That hip chain! Too glam!\nJacobs’ entire Resort 2017 collection was replete with ’80s themes, including vintage MTV sweatshirts, crimped hair, and majorly chunky belts.\nA photo posted by Colyn Rastapog (@colynrastapog) on Jun 7, 2016 at 11:00am PDT \nIn fact, the model who originally showed off Moore’s dress on the runway in June last year rocked crimped hair, a leopard-print belt, and a star-studded choker. It doesn’t get more ’80s than that. Check out her look below, on the left.\nA photo posted by @it.doll on Jun 9, 2016 at 4:37am PDT \nMoore’s take on the frock was a bit more subdued and, as we’ve termed it, a little Holly Hobbie-esque. Seriously! You couldn’t possibly have forgotten this doll, with her fabulous patchwork dress and matching bonnet.\nA photo posted by Row by Roe (@rowbyroe) on Jan 5, 2017 at 9:43am PST \nDoes she nod remind you at least a tiny by of Moore on the red carpet? We thought so.\nBetween Kim Kardashian West’s shoulder pads and Kristen Bell’s fluffy, side-swept Golden Globes hair, we’re definitely convinced that the ’80s are making a comeback. Will you embrace the trend this year?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:33:05.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
