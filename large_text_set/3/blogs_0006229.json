Jurgen Klopp wants his Liverpool players to demonstrate their quality and fighting spirit when they host Burnley on Nissan Super Sunday . \nFourth-placed Liverpool will move to within a point of Manchester City and Tottenham if they beat Sean Dyche's side, who have claimed just two points away from home this term. Liverpool vs Burnley \nLiverpool continued their impressive record against the teams around them in the table with a 3-1 win at home to Arsenal last weekend. \nBut all of their five league defeats this season have come against teams in the bottom half table, leading to suggestions Liverpool struggle to break down teams who are happy to sit in and defend and allow the Reds to dominate possession. \n\"People say I don't have a Plan B or whatever [but] yes, we know how to play,\" Klopp said. \n\"We have to cover specific spaces and make the right decisions. We can't just say we can only concentrate on counter attacks, set pieces, whatever. It's an all-round challenge. Georginio Wijnaldum rounded off Liverpool's win over Arsenal with a fine counter-attacking goal \n\"My job, how I understand it, is to help them find the right decisions easier. That's what training is for [now] we have to prove it on the pitch. \n\"Before Arsenal, the mood was optimistic. In this moment, I'm not sure we will win against Burnley but I am quite optimistic because I know about the boys. \n\"We always have to be competitive and that's what we have to be in this game too, no-one should expect an easy game. We are ready for the fight\" Andre Gray scored twice in Burnley's 2-0 win over Liverpool at Turf Moor \nLiverpool will be hungry to avenge August's 2-0 loss to Burnley at Turf Moor, which came a week after they won 4-3 at Arsenal in their Premier League season-opener. \n\"We really respect Burnley a lot because we lost there, because of their season and their style of play,\" Klopp said. Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge absent again through injury \n\"It will be hard, I'm sure of it, if we don't score early or another goal early then it will be difficult. Yes they have lost away games but it's not like they lost them high, they've all been close games. \n\"They defend, counter-attack, long balls in behind, set-pieces. It can't be easy against them. We need to be ready. We need to create an atmosphere and use the advantage of Anfield.\" Roberto Firmino celebrates Liverpool's opener against Arsenal \nSkipper Jordan Henderson and England striker Daniel Sturridge will both miss the visit of Burnley, with the pair sidelined through injury for the third game in succession. \nBut Klopp also has doubts about the availability of Roberto Firmino who scored Liverpool's opener and contributed an assist against Arsenal last weekend. \n\"Roberto Firmino struggles a little,\" Klopp said. \n\"He felt something after the game and this week he couldn't train. We need to wait a little bit more and see. [if he will be able to play]. James Milner is in line to make his 600th career appearance on Sunday \nOne man who is expected to start the game is midfielder-turned full-back James Milner, who is in line to make the 600th appearance of his 14-and-a-half-year career to date. \n\"He's played a lot of different positions [in his career],\" Klopp said. \n\"Was he a winger? A half 8? He played as a striker. That's good and very important for us. 600, though! \n\"That is quite a number and a few to come, that's impressive. He doesn't look like he's played 600.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T15:53:19.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
