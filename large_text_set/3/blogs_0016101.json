And so, we have to figure out how to navigate that in a good way.\" \nComey didn't elaborate, and it's impossible to say with complete confidence what he meant. But it seems fair to read his comment as saying this: If we kept to our practice, when we briefed congressional leaders, we would also have to brief the White House. We didn't want to brief the White House, so we didn't brief anybody. \nBy saying he wanted to keep the investigation \"tight within the executive branch,\" Comey actually meant tight within the FBI — never mind that the White House is the head of the executive branch. Thus, Comey kept the fact of the investigation secret from the congressional overseers who certainly had a right to know what was going on. \nComey's secrecy may have had wide-ranging repercussions. Even though there were leaks from inside the investigation, the fact that the FBI , for so many months, would not acknowledge the existence of the probe led to widespread public doubt — and wild debate — about what was happening. \nEven people who should have known what was going on — say, the chairman of the House or Senate intelligence committee — couldn't say. And, if Comey kept the director of national intelligence in the dark as well, then his public statements were to some degree uninformed, as well. Just a few weeks ago, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made news when he said that, as of his departure from office on Jan. 20, he knew of no evidence of Trumpworld collusion with the Russians. \nMany lawmakers and journalists cited Clapper's statement to support the argument that there's no there there in the Trumpworld collusion allegation. But for all the public knows, James Comey kept Clapper in the dark, too. \nThe problem with all the spy-vs.-spy secrecy is that on an issue of the utmost public importance — remember that some opponents hope to use the Russia issue to drive President Trump from office — people who should know something, and thus be able to speak authoritatively, in fact knew even less than we thought they did. And all, apparently, so James Comey could keep his secret.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:56:19.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
