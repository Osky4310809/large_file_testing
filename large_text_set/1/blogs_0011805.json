PUBLISHED: 21:04, Wed, Jan 11, 2017 | UPDATED: 21:22, Wed, Jan 11, 2017 \nThe discovery could open the way to new developments in combating the disease even before symptoms occur. \nProf David Burn of the University of Newcastle said: “That would be game-changing. \n“There are lots of different mechanisms that could potentially stop the spread.” Getty Scientists now believe Parkinson's Disease may be triggered by problems in the gut (stock image) \nThe degenerative disease involves the death of neutrons in the brain which cause tremors, stiffness and problems with mobility. \nDrugs are available to help combat the disease but they become less effective as the disease develops. \nOne of the hallmarks of the condition is deposits of insoluble fibres of a substance called synuclein.

Fox continues to defy odds as he smoulders at magazine bash \nThese are usually found as small soluble molecules in healthy nerve cells, in people with Parkinson’s, something causes the synuclein molecules to warp into a different shape, making them clump together as fibres. \nThe indications that this transition may start outside the brain came about a decade ago, when pathologists reported seeing the distinctive synuclein fibres in nerves of the gut during autopsies – both in people with Parkinson’s and in those without symptoms but who had the fibres in their brain. \nThey suggested the trigger was some unknown microbe or toxin. Getty Conceptual computer artwork of Parkinson's Disease \nThis matched with people’s experience of suffering from the disease who reported digestive problems - mainly constipation. \nAnother early sign of the disease is the loss of smell which Prof Burn believes is no coincidence. \nThe nose and gut are two organs where nerve cells are exposed to the outside world - and to potentially damaging toxins and microbes. \nNow, the synuclein fibres have been shown travelling from the gut to deep within the brain. Getty Coronal view of a human brain in Parkinsons disease. Blue/green areas highlight fibre of the motor \nCollin Challis at the California Institute of Technology and his colleagues injected synuclein fibres into the stomach and intestine of mice. \nJust three weeks later the fibres could be seen at the base of the brain, and by two months they had travelled to parts of the brain that control movement. \nMirroring the effects of Parkinson’s the mice also became less agile. \nThe findings were reported to the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego last month. \nProf Burn has indicated that people who have had the main nerve to their stomach cut, which was an old treatment for stomach ulcers, had a lower risk of developing Parkinson’s. \nNo single bacterium or virus has been pinpointed as the cause. \nBut early evidence suggests that people with Parkinson’s have different gut bacteria to healthy people. Some doctors are already experimenting with treating patients with antibiotics or faecal transplants. \n“It could be that having the wrong bacteria in your gut triggers inflammation,” says Sébastien Paillusson at King’s College London. “We know that inflammation makes synuclein more likely to aggregate.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:34:55.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
