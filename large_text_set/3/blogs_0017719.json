For every dollar in federal spending, one-fifth of one penny goes to the agency we all depend on to protect clean water, air and lands, to defend us from toxic chemicals, clean up hazardous waste and make it possible to leave our children a livable world. \nOn Thursday, as part of his larger attack on our environment and health, President Trump proposed gutting the EPA with draconian staff and budget cuts meant to hobble the national guardian of our environment and leave industry free to pollute our land. \nSince 2010, the EPA has already absorbed budget and staff cuts of 21% and 11%, respectively. \nNYC budget director expects Trump funding cuts to hit city \nOn top of that, Trump has proposed a 20% staff cut, which would set EPA's workforce back to 1984 levels. His 31% budget cut would take EPA funding to its lowest level in 27 years. \nDuring that time, the U.S. economy has nearly doubled, population is up 30% and the complexity and scope of the environmental threats we face has grown accordingly. We can't defeat tomorrow's threats with yesterday's resources. \nCongress needs to stand up for the American people, resist Trump's backward lurch and make sure the EPA has the tools to do its job. If Trump has his way, the nation's top environmental steward will be taken off the beat. Let's consider what that might look like. Trump and Pruitt (Andrew Harnik/AP) \nA good place to begin is the Clean Air Act, which the EPA is responsible for enforcing. One of the most successful pieces of legislation ever, the rule prevents some 160,000 premature deaths, 130,000 heart attacks and 13 million lost days of work — every year. \nTrump to unveil proposed $1.15T budget that funds border wall \nTrump's cuts would eviscerate the EPA's authority to enforce clean air regulations, as it did just last year in slapping penalties on an industrial storage facility and a chemicals plant in upstate New York. \nAfter Hurricane Sandy lambasted the New York region in the fall of 2012, EPA inspectors, monitors and attorneys swarmed in to make sure one disaster didn't lead to others. They made sure we weren't drinking water contaminated by spills of chemicals or oil. They helped get waste treatment facilities back up and running. They tested air quality in demolition zones for dangerous levels of lead and dust. And they made sure people had the information they needed to safely return to their homes without getting sick from debris or mold. \nTrump's cuts would leave the EPA hard put to mount that kind of emergency response when the next disaster strikes - in our state or any other. \nTrump has proposed deep cuts in the Superfund program essential to the ongoing clean up of carcinogens from the sediments of the Hudson River. Deep staff cuts would come as EPA professionals are hard at work designing the next phase of the clean up, likely to last another decade or more. \nTrump's proposed budget guts domestic spending to boost military \nAcross the state to Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, the EPA's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is helping to clean up industrial contamination and invasive species that threaten these waters, beaches and all they support. Trump would slash the program by 97%. Donald Trump in the White House \nNew York hosts the headwaters of the nation's largest natural estuary, the Chesapeake Bay. Trump wants to eliminate entirely a program that, for $73 million a year, is making a real difference in restoring the bay to its natural state, after decades of industrial, municipal and agricultural pollution have nearly strangled the life out of it. \nHe's also proposed eliminating the popular Energy Star program, a voluntary labeling system that helps consumers pick the most energy efficient refrigerator, dishwasher or air conditioner for their home. For roughly $50 million a year, this program helps our businesses and families save more than $30 billion a year in utility costs. \nTrump, who has repeatedly called climate change a \"hoax,\" also calls for eliminating all funding for one of the most important measures we've ever taken to protect our children from the ravages of rising seas, withering drought, blistering heat and other hallmarks of climate disruption. The EPA's 2015 Clean Power Plan calls for cutting the carbon footprint of the dirty power plants that account for 40% of the nation's carbon emissions. Under Trump's budgetary vision: gone. \nA small sample of thing that could suffer under Trump budget \nTrump has a simple approach to protecting our precious natural resources: let the environment fend for itself. Put another way, he’s putting polluter profits first and putting the American people at risk, especially our seniors and children, who are most vulnerable to the sickness and disease brought on by breathing dirty air and drinking contaminated water. \nThis shouldn't be all that complicated. One fifth of one penny on the dollar for the health of the natural systems we all depend on, for our quality of life, for our livelihoods, for life itself? That's a bargain — in anybody's budget. The President has his priorities mixed up. Congress needs to set this straight. \nSuh is president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
