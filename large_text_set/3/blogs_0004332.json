By karthika raveendran | Updated: March 7, 2017 8:47 pm comments \nThe 46th Kerala State Awards were announced today. Vinayakan won the best Actor award for his hard hitting performance in the dark crime drama Kammatipaadum. Manikandan Achary won the second Best Actor award for the same film. They beat Mohanlal, Fahadh Faisl, Dulquer who were also in the race for this award. Interestingly, Dulquer was part of the same film. He also received immense praise for his gritty performance. But if someone is a super sport, it’s Dulquer who took to social media to congratulate both his co-stars for their big wins. Vinayakan’s flawless performance had made people sit when the movie had released.

The story is dark and rather simple, but when combined with the amazing non linear narration and screenplay, it creates a great experience. You cannot help but get hooked to the story of Krishna, who narrates it from three points of view. One being his past and how became a criminal, the next being the recent events that lead up to him being stabbed and third is his present where he is writhing in pain. The world of Kammattipaadam is very real, where the hero gets beaten up, stabbed, kicked, almost everything you can imagine. In terms of performances, actors Manikandan and Vinayak,who play Bala and Ganga who really steal the show. Brutal, savage and full of energy, these two are the life of the film.’ Woo hooo !!!! Huuuge congrats to Best Actor Vinayakan chetan and Best Character Actor Manikandan chetan !! #Kammattipaadam !! #StateAwards pic.twitter.com/wucwUPb2SY \n— dulquer salmaan (@dulQuer) March 7, 2017 \nKammattipadam is based on a slum community from Ernakulam. It revolves round the Dalit community who lose everything, as Kochi prioritises urbanisation over human lives. \nSo, do you think Vinayakan deserves in the awrad?
