Smith Center. Jonathan Jones of Sports Illustrated captured the longtime coach yelling at a fan at halftime against North Carolina: Jonathan Jones @jjones9 The Cardinals trailed, 33-30, at intermission in a game between Top 10 ACC teams. Jeff Greer of the Courier-Journal provided some info on the aftermath of the altercation: Jeff Greer @jeffgreer_cj U of L support staff just came out with UNC staff and the cops in the corner of the stands where fans/Pitino exchanged words. 2/23/2017, 2:58:14 AM Eric Crawford of WDRB reported that the 64-year-old coach was angry on the sidelines even before the incident. Pitino is a Hall-of-Famer who has been a college basketball head coach since 1978, including two stints in the NBA. He has heard plenty of criticism in his career, which makes it seem as though whatever occurred had to be more than simple taunting.
