Hey Chuck: Suck my fucking butt.”\nSheen also revealed that John Travolta’s wife John Travolta once tried to convert him to Scientology, as well as what it was like to work with Lindsay Lohan on Anger Management .\n“She must have had a big night one time, and we had this garbage bin on the set and the crew and cast named it the ‘Lindsay’ bin because she was puking into it.”\nThen after the episode was complete he invited her over to watch it where things, as one might expect with these tow getting together, got weird. Or well, weirder.\n“Either I outdrank her, or she outdrank me, and all I know is, she tucked me into bed and said, ‘sleep well, sweet prince,’” recalled Sheen.\nTo which host Kyle asked, “So there was no, you know?”\n“Nope, that was it!” replied Sheen.\nWhat a life this guy’s led, huh?\n[ KISS 106.5 , Fox News , news.com.au ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:09:28.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
