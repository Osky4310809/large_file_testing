War Short Film 'Rise' To Be Turned into Possible Film Franchise Two-Wheeled Bipedal Nightmare Robot Is Brought To You By Boston Dynamics It’s no longer just humans that need to worry about robots taking their jobs. Spongebob could find himself standing in the unemployment line soon, too… his skinflint boss could choose to replace him with Flippy.\nWho’s Flippy? Why a robotic short order cook with an affinity for flipping burgers. Flippy cooks burgers perfectly every time, according to Miso Robotics… not like those annoyingly imperfect humans without AI brains that sometimes leave your patty on the grill until it’s a charcoal disc.\nFlippy is a single-arm robot with a task-specific hand. It’s a sort of hinged claw that claps shut around a burger. Once a slab of beef (or chicken, turkey, veggie, or anything else that will fit) has been scooped up, Flippy gives its articulated wrist a quick spin, opens the claw, and drops the burger back on the grill.\nAI-assisted vision ensures that Flippy always knows the status of every burger on the grill… Even that disturbingly-labeled “hand burger,” which was placed there by hand by a human employee, not made out of the hands of human employees.\nMiso refers to Flippy, a kitchen assistant. They’re careful to point out that humans will still play a vital role in eateries that roll out one of their bots, like the 50 Caliburger locations that have already signed on . Final assembly of the burgers, for example, is still best left up to a human.\nCEO David Zito also believes that “tasting food and creating recipes will always be the purview of a chef.” You know, until someone develops an AI that can create delicious recipes from scratch and a robotic tongue.", "external_links": ["https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/meet-flippy-a-burger-grilling-robot-from-miso-robotics-and-caliburger/", "https://player.vimeo.com/video/206666438?wmode=transparent"], "published": "2017-03-09T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:58:45.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
