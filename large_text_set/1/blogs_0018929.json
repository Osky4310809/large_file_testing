Thankfully, the final injury report of the week shows the team has pretty much recovered from this flu-like bug as have most of the players who have missed games recently due to injury.\nThe #Steelers have three players on the status report for Sunday. Fitz Touissant, Ladarius Green & James Harrison are all questionable.\n— Missi Matthews (@missi_matthews) January 20, 2017 \nWhile he has not been officially ruled out for Sunday, Ladarius Green is still in concussion protocols and would need to be cleared by an independent specialist if he is to be able to play. Considering how long Green has been sidelined, it would be a surprise to see him back on the field this weekend, even if he did receive medical clearance. When talking to Chris Adamski of TribLive, Green did not sound like a man expecting to feature either.\n“Of course I want to play, but I am just taking it day by day and seeing whatever the coaches want me to do. I was just out there in practice; I really didn’t do too much. Just running around; I was trying to get in there. It’s been so long since I’ve been out there and played, so I was just out there.”\nThere is a chance Green might see a limited selection of plays if cleared, but that is perhaps more wishful thinking than anything else. He was the only player listed a limited participant on the daily practice report and has not managed a full day of training this week.\nRelated: Without a Super Bowl, the season is 'a waste' for James Harrison \nAlthough James Harrison is listed a questionable, it seems unimaginable he will not play in Foxboro. He may not be able to play almost every down at his position as he has been doing of late, but there is little doubt he will be out there on Sunday. Harrison was a full participant at practice on Friday after sitting out Thursday.\nHaving been cleared by medical staff and a full participant every day, Fitzgerald Toussaint could well make a return in New England. Although, Justin Gilbert has already suggested he would be handling kick return duties this weekend, so the backup running back may yet have to wait another week for his return.\nRelated: Steelers the masters of distraction in 2016 \nWith possibly only one player set to be ruled out due to injury on game day, this report might be the best one of the season all things considered. The Steelers appear to finally have both Anthony Chickillo and Ricardo Mathews back at just the right time. Both were full participants at practice all week for the first time in a while and should be good to go once more. The return of Mathews, in particular, will be a huge boost to the defensive line.\nSean Davis and Vince Williams, the only two other names featuring on the practice report due to physical injury, were also back in full training again on Friday. Even though each of them will be under 100 percent against the Patriots, they should be more than healthy enough to be a factor.\nFor now, it appears the virus that had the team in its grip has been contained, with no new sufferers reported and all those who had been under the weather were in full training again on Friday. All of the players listed a questionable for New England were limited each day in practice in the run-up to this game. Given the way the Patriots run their injury report, it is anyone’s guess how injured they really are.\nRelated: Is DeAngelo Williams the secret weapon for the Steelers' offense? \nHere is the full injury report for the AFC championship game from Steelers.com.\nSteelers: Out: No players listed.\nDoubtful: No players listed.\nQuestionable: TE Ladarius Green (Concussion), LB James Harrison (Shoulder), RB Fitzgerald Toussaint (Concussion).\nPatriots: Out: No players listed.\nDoubtful: No players listed.\nQuestionable: WR Danny Amendola (Ankle), TE Matrellus Bennett (Knee), RB Brandon Bolden (Knee), LB Dont’a Hightower (Shoulder), WR Chris Hogan (Thigh), WR Malcolm Mitchell (Knee), DL Jabaal Sheard (Knee)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:05:15.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
