While the health and fitness-themed wearable devices that Withings created will continue to be sold, along with its other connected products, they will be available under a new, but still familiar, name: Nokia .\nSee also: Withings Activité Steel review April 16, 2016 You may remember that Nokia first announced plans to acquire the French-based Withings just under a year ago. That deal was completed in June 2016 for about $191 million . A few days ago, Withings stated they would be joining Nokia as part of a press event today at the 2017 Mobile World Congress trade show. As it turns out, the big reveal for Withings is that their name is going away in favor of Nokia.\n\nThe company’s press release says that all of the products that were being sold under the Withings banner will continue to be available after the brand name change happens this summer. In addition to its wearable fitness tracker devices like the Activité Steel and the more recently launched Steel HR , the name change will also affect its other products, including its connected scales, blood pressure monitors, thermometers and home cameras.\nCedric Hutchings, Nokia’s VP of Digital Health, gave the company’s reasons for ditching the Withings brand in a press release:\nNokia is a powerful global brand that is synonymous with innovation, connectivity and great design. Withings joined Nokia because we share a vision to inspire individuals to take control of their own health. With the full power of a brand recognized for trust, reliability and quality, we will reach more people and impact more lives to help the human family be healthier together.\n\nThe announcement also revealed plans to revamp the Withings app under the new Nokia Health Mate name. The company says the app will make it easier for users to add Nokia’s health devices. It will also feature some improvements on the fitness side, including some “new in-depth coaching programs” that will give people an “eight-week journey” to help achieve their health and fitness goals. The app will also have improvements so that users can share their fitness and health progress with their family members. The new version of the app will be released around the same time as the Nokia rebranding this summer.\nWhat do you think of Nokia’s decision to ditch the Withings brand in favor of its own for its health and fitness products and apps?
