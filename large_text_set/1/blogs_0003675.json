The old library is one room packed with shelves of books, hardly room to move about!” Sounds like my kind of place. I must remember to pay a visit when I’m next in the Dales. \nAdmittedly the comments under the entry do give you pause for thought. “In the much-recommended bookshop in Hawes I met the man I never thought I would – someone who made me ashamed for liking books,” says a poster called Katherine. “Someone who made me more than that, ashamed for a moment for even having an interest in books ... What an unbelievable moment – the man who owned a secondhand bookshop who would happily charge for browsing.” Critics misunderstand the nature of secondhand bookselling. Secondhand booksellers don’t like people. They like books. That’s the whole point. \n“I was threatened with being thrown out for spending too much time browsing when I’d barely been in the place five minutes,” adds Robin. “Won’t be back.” “Like many others here, I was appalled to be asked to pay an entry fee,” chimes in Keith Walker. “The world of secondhand books is filled with lovely people, but this guy isn’t one of them. My sympathies to the people who work for him.” \nMost of those commenting reckon that charging 50p for entry to a secondhand bookshop, and being a little brusque even with the people who cough up for a chance to scan the shelves, will more or less guarantee that Bloomindales will have a short shelf life. But I wouldn’t be so sure. \nBloomindales – and its idiosyncratic owner, Steve Bloom – has become a cause célèbre after media reports branding him “ the bookseller from hell ” and the rudest shopkeeper in Britain. It’s a fair bet that the shop will be mobbed today by people who want to experience his unusual approach to retailing, and by journalists desperate to interview him. Appearances on I’m A Celebrity and Strictly Come Dancing will no doubt follow. Life for Mr Bloom is about to come up roses. \nHe has been singled out for calling one customer “a pain in the arse” – a comment Mr Bloom now says he regrets. He also appears to have a difficult relationship with the local parish council, which is tired of fielding complaints about his behaviour, and thinks he is bad for the image of the town (though they may revise their opinion when tourists keen to see this now famous bookshop start to flock in). Mr Bloom freely admits he is “not really a people person”. \nHis critics would argue that someone who is not really a people person should probably not be running a business that relies on interacting with people. But they misunderstand the nature of secondhand bookselling. Secondhand booksellers don’t like people. They like books. That’s the whole point. People who come in to secondhand bookshops – especially the ones who spend an hour sheltering from the rain, leaving puddles over the floor and making the cat wet when they stroke it – are bloody irritating. \nThe book dealer Driff Field (aka Drif, Driffield and Dryfield) used to publish a marvellous guide to secondhand bookshops – when they were numerous across the UK. Most of those bookshops have now disappeared – and Driff’s guide ceased publication in the mid-1990s after six treasurable editions. All killed by the wretched internet. Driff understood secondhand booksellers exactly: they were generally men of a certain age who had been disappointed in life. Books were their only solace – friends who never let you down. \nThe abbreviations Drif uses in his guides are inspired. FARTS: “Follows around recommending the stock.” GOB: “Grand old bore.” WYLAH: “Watches you like a hawk.” “WEBCOC: “Was expecting a better class of customer.” His summings up are magisterial: “V. erratic but will answer if you ring bell. FARTS. Rumoured to be closing down.” He is especially good on booksellers who don’t actually want to part with their stock. The books are their friends, remember. Why should they sell them to an oik like you? Yorkshire's 'bookseller from hell' regrets calling customer 'a pain in the arse' Read more \nMr Bloom is one of the last, honourable remnants of this dying breed. Secondhand bookshops have been decimated by the internet. There used to be seven in Richmond, south-west London. None remains. Everywhere they are an endangered species. That is why Mr Bloom feels he has to charge 50p to browsers – refundable if you actually buy a book, it should be noted. \nAs for the rudeness, it goes with the territory. Secondhand booksellers are natural misanthropes. If you don’t buy a book, you are wasting their time; if you do a buy a book, you are stealing one of their friends. Either way, they will hate you. \nSo enjoy the miserable experience. A and, like Drif, aim to give as good as you get. Book lovers are life haters – and Mr Bloom is a hero, not a villain, keeping an ancient tradition alive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T16:50:45.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
