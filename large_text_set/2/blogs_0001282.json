Photo by Naoki Mengua/Rappler \nCAVITE, Philippines – At least two workers of House Technology Industries (HTI) are confirmed missing the morning after a fire hit the factory at the Cavite Export Processing Zone on Wednesday, February 1. \nThis was based only on the attendance check that the company conducted on Thursday, February 2, starting at 8 am. Employees were asked to gather at the facility's gate – as the fire continued to rage in the factory some two kilometers away – so supervisors would know who had gotten out safe the night before. \nMichael delos Santos, a production operator at HTI, shared that workers were asked to sign a piece of paper that serves as their attendance for the day to confirm their safety. They were later sent home. He said that the firm will issue a statement when they can return to work. \nCavite Governor Jesus Crispin, in a press conference Thursday, said: \"Definitely, there are missing people, according to those who were inside. But we need to validate it with a ground survey.\" \nThe governor said that authorities cannot verify the total number of affected people as they can only inspect the facility an hour after the fire is put out. \n\"We cannot enter until it's a total fire out. There might still be ember and it might spark fire again,\" he said. \nThe fire, which broke at 6:15 pm Wednesday, was declared under control by 11:30 pm, but is not completely put out as of posting. \nAccording to Remulla, there were between 4,000 to 6,000 workers in the facility when the fire broke at 6:15 pm – they had just changed shifts. \nThere were 104 people brought to nearby hospitals for treatment, 4 of whom are in critical condition, although a hospital owner earlier said 20.
