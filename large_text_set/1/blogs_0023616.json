That person is former Mexican president Vincente Fox , who has already said his country is “not paying for that fucking wall,” not once , but twice . \nWhen Trump tweeted this… of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting. \n— Donald J.

Mexico has spoken, we will never ever pay for the #FuckingWall . https://t.co/a79WDY5vlv \n— Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) January 26, 2017 \nYeah, he hashtagged it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T17:38:14.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
