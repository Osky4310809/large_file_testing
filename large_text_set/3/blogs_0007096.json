The dhak dhak girl has been sharing everything, from movie stills to old photo shoots, and, frankly, we are loving the insight into the dancing diva's life through the years. \nYesterday, she shared this picture from Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam , in which she starred opposite Shah Rukh Khan and captioned it, \"A girl can get swept off her feet, even in the movies.\" We get it, Ms. Dixit. We totally do!!
