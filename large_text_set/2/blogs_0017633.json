I told Liverpool I was honoured but I was only one year in at Ajax, it was too soon. I needed to achieve more, and I did.\" De Boer won four Dutch titles in a row at Ajax (Photo: Getty) The Reds opted for Brendan Rodgers (Photo: Ben Hoskins/Getty) \nThe Reds instead opted for Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers. \nDe Boer quit his role at Ajax at the end of last season to take the top job at Inter Milan - but would only last 85 days before given the boot in November. \nHe admits that he was relishing a new challenge in Serie A, but external pressures ground him down. Inter Milan manager Frank De Boer (Photo: Sunday Mail) \n\"Leaving Ajax after 25 years as player, coach and manager was hard, but sometimes you are saying the same things, you need a new challenge, like Pep,\" De Boer continued. \n\"But at Inter I had to deal with so many things away from football, you lose energy. \n\"Every time you thought, \"Finally, a good result, everything has calmed down\", then comes Mauro Icardi's book (in which the captain criticised the club's Ultras) or Marcelo Brozovic is in the discotheque and you have to punish him. We only had three months but honestly, it felt like a year.\" \nDe Boer was replaced by Stefano Pioli in the San Siro dugout. poll loading Liverpool fans!
