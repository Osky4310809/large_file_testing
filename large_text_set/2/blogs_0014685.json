The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade is not official and has not been announced by either team. The deal pairs the 6-foot-11 Cousins, a frontcourt All-Star from nearby Mobile, Alabama, with the 6-11 Anthony Davis, who on Sunday night was the All-Star Game MVP after scoring 52 points, breaking Wilt Chamberlain’s 1962 record of 42. ADVERTISEMENT The move also sends a message that the Pelicans are committed to a push for a playoff spot. New Orleans (23-34) went into the All-Star break 2 ½ games behind Denver for the eighth and final playoff seeding in the Western Conference. Cousins, like Davis a former collegiate star at Kentucky, is averaging 27.8 points and 10.6 rebounds this season. But he is due to become a free agent in 2018 unless the Pelicans can sign him to an All-Star caliber extension. The Kings get a player with a lot of potential in Hield, although he has been inconsistent during his rookie season out of Oklahoma, where as a senior he was one of the best players in the nation. Hield is averaging 8.6 points but has been explosive at times, with a season high of 21 points. The 6-6 Evans, who can play point guard, shooting guard or small forward, will be entering a second stint in Sacramento, where he was drafted in 2009 and went on to be Rookie of the Year. Galloway has been a solid reserve, providing scoring punch from the perimeter. The 6-9 Casspi has been playing about 19 minutes per game for the Kings this season, averaging 5.9 points and 4.1 rebounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:14:05.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
