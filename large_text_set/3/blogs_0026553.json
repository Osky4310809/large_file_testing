In a brief statement to sister-site CNET , the company said the data came from \"previously compromised third-party services,\" and that it is \"actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.\" \nThat seems to tie in with what the hackers said in an email to some members of the press late on Wednesday. The hackers denied any direct breach of Apple systems. What muddies the water is that the hackers also appear in some cases to have passwords that have been only used for iCloud. Welcome to the wonderful world of security nuance. \nWe have worked for the past few days to get to the bottom of this. Here's what we've learned. \nZDNet obtained a set of 54 credentials from the hacker group for verification. All the 54 accounts were valid, based on a check using the site's password reset function. (You can learn more about how we verify data breaches here .) \nThese accounts include \"icloud.com,\" dating back to 2011, and legacy \"me.com\" and \"mac.com\" domains from as early as 2000. The list of credentials contained just email addresses and plain-text passwords, separated by a colon, which according to Troy Hunt , data breach expert and owner of notification site Have I Been Pwned , makes it likely that the data \"could be aggregated from various sources\". \nWe started working to contact each person, one by one, to confirm their password. Most of the accounts are no longer registered with iMessage and could not be immediately reached. \nHowever, 10 people in total confirmed that their passwords were accurate, and as a result have now been changed. \nThose 10 people we spoke to were based in the UK, and had UK cell phone numbers. All the people we spoke to were on different cell networks. (A person representing the group, who is allegedly no longer a member, told me that the data is \"handled in groups\", but would not explain how or why. The hackers refused to hand over a US-based sample of accounts.) \nThe same 10 people confirmed that they had used the same password since opening their iCloud accounts. Most of those we spoke to had not changed their iCloud passwords since they opened their accounts. \nAccording to the responses, most of the people had the same passwords on their accounts for \"about four or five years\" since iCloud's debut. One person said specifically that the password he confirmed with us was no longer in use as of about two years ago, which narrows down the possible date of a breach or multiple breaches to somewhere between 2011 and 2015. \nSome of the people we spoke to only own iPhones, while others own Macs and iPads but do not own an iPhone. That may rule out if an individual Apple product line was compromised in some way. \nWe also asked if their accounts were used on other services, to potentially verify if another site had been compromised. \nMost of the people we spoke to confirmed that they used their iCloud email address and password on other sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. \nHowever, three people said that their iCloud email address and password were unique to iCloud, and were not used on any other site -- a key anomaly that, if accurate, we can't explain. \nTwo of the people we spoke to confirmed that someone had tried to reset their iCloud accounts in the past day. One of the people said that they had received login notifications on Twitter, which used the same iCloud email address and password. This seems fitting with the hackers' apparent desires to reset accounts as they claim. \n\"All from London [where the hackers claim to be located], from different browsers at the same time,\" said the person.
