Yep, really.\nLet's back up.\nIt all started when Donald Trump 's \"counselor\" (who is often counseled herself) did a press tour this morning making ZERO sense when trying to explain the former NSA Michael Flynn 's resignation.\nRelated: Melissa McCarthy Doubles Down On Sean Spicer \nThe political commentator found her first fan in Twitter user Lib Hypocrisy , who sent Kellyanne praise over social media saying:\n\nMiz Conway responded to her No. 1 fan by not only retweeting the positive feedback to her profile, but she also responded with \"love you back\" while shouting out her haters:\n\nThis love fest wouldn't be so alarming if Kellyanne didn't just PUBLICLY CONFESS her admiration for someone who not only LOVES Steve Bannon but whose bio literally includes the hashtags \"#WhiteIdentity\" and \"#Nationalist\": \n\nIn response, Kellyanne told Buzzfeed News she has NO IDEA who posted that from her account:\n\"I don't know who had access to my account. Let me see who tweeted that. That's terrible. I denounce whoever it is. It will be immediately deleted. Everybody makes mistakes.\"\nHahahahaâ€¦.. hahahaha.\n\nSeriously guys, when are we going to stop putting up with this bullshit???\nThis corrupt administration continues to promote and support white supremacists!
