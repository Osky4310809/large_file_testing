Tabitha appeared to discuss her husband's attraction (Photo: ITV) Phillip and Holly grilled her on why she stuck by her husband (Photo: ITV) \nShe explained: \"My background is a midwife. And really, nothing is said by patients by families that is going to shock you. \n\"He assured me that he has done nothing. I believe this was the truth. I realise people can lie.

But that he had that attraction.\" Read More Good Morning Britain viewers slam shocking proposals to charge overweight passengers MORE to fly \n\"He assured me he is not a child molestor.

She's refused to disown Gary (Photo: ITV) He's admitted that he wants to seek help (Photo: ITV) \nTabitha responded: \"For his part, porn is not of any interest to him. Whether he is aroused while out shopping, that might be the case. But there is a difference between an attraction, and an action.\" \n\"What do you suggest society should do,\" asked Phillip. \"He says he is a virtuous paedophile. Can he teach others not to act?\" \nThe former nurse, who met her spouse via a Christian singles dating site in 2004, went on to add that there should be more help out there for people who realise they hold such attractions.

Some viewers slammed her for supporting her husband (Photo: ITV) \nViewers were quick to slam the woman for standing by her husband, especially when it was claimed he HAD engaged in sexual activity with children when he was 12 years old. \n\"How is that woman sitting there so calmly and saying that her husband is attracted to little girls and admits he's a peadophile #thismorning,\" wrote one viewer. The couple met in 2004 (Photo: ITV) \n\"An attraction is different?! She's disgusting. Her and her husband want locking up.
