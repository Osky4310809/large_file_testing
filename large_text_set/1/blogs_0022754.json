How do you find the right words to describe a gator that’s dressed to impress and ready for a night on the town? \nMisguided friends and family who think they understand might spout well-meaning assumptions like “an alligator would look pretty nice in a bow tie,” but this is a gross simplification of how elegant and refined a bow-tie-wearing alligator would be. \nFortunately, an artist drew this amazing cartoon you can use to explain how an alligator would look in a bow tie. Talk about a truth bomb. In one image, the comic perfectly depicts what an alligator in a bow tie would look like. \nA mere description could never fully convey the appearance of a fancy alligator that’s wearing a bow tie, and this drawing distills it all down to a single, incisive, illuminating panel. If you ever meet someone who’s confused what a bow-tie-wearing alligator would look like, this comic will instantly open their eyes. \nMic freaking dropped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T15:36:39.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
