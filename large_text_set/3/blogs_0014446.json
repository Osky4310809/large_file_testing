But now I am done with Trump. Here’s why:\n– Trump has accused President Obama of wiretapping him. Fine. But the FBI and the US Congress have refuted those allegations, as has Obama. Now it’s not that Obama was not perfectly capable of eavesdropping on anyone and more.\nBut Trump has not been able to come up with any proof. For a sitting US president to accuse a departing US president of snooping is almost tantamount to heresy, and that too when Obama, by Trump’s own admission, was extremely gracious to him during the transition period.\n– The travel bans: In a country where laws are, in general, followed and where the judiciary is, by and large, fiercely independent, for Trump’s travel bans to overturned not by one judge, but by four separate ones is just shameful. As president, Trump is well within his rights to bar anyone from his country as long as he, the US president, doesn’t violate his Constitution.\nNow what will he do? Come up with Travel Ban Extra Lite? I bet you even that will not pass muster.\n– Mexicans are rapists: Even during the campaign, this was a hard pill to swallow. Most Mexicans in the US are hard-working fellas. There has been no credible study to indicate that they as a ethnic group indulge in rape more than any other group.\n– Rewarding failed generals: Trump has appointed four generals who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, all losing causes for the US. That means these generals won their stars and stripes while their country was getting hammered. Rommel was only appointed Field Marshall when he outfoxed the Allies in Africa. Eisenhower won the war and only then became president.\nOh, but we won some battles in Iraq and Afghanistan. And we learned a lot. Hogwash. How about having a decent, experienced, and most importantly, a man who won a war, Colin Powell, in a key position? And it should be simple. He’s a Republican. But he may not toe Trump’s line, as he refused to George W.’s. So he’s out.\n– Blaming the same generals: As commander-in-chief, Trump ordered the recent botched-up US raid in Yemen in which a Navy Seal died. But in a widely-telecast interview, Trump blamed his generals for botching up. Imagine what that must have done to their morale.\n– Puffed-up cops: American cops are as notorious for their brutality as their Indian counterparts. All over TV today you see cops herding Mexicans as if they were cattle. To send them into pens. To deport them. You yourself arrive in New York and are subject to a near-rectal examination, in part because you have grown a long beard.\nYour friend, a second-generation Mexican in California, has started carrying his US passport everywhere. There was never any need to carry your passport anywhere in the US except in the ultra-conservative state of Arizona. Yes, you need to carry your passport in Europe, especially in Germany, because as a Jordanian friend rued, they ask for it four times a day.\nBut the US is not Europe. And the day the US forces me to carry my passport everywhere, I leave.\n– Look like Arabs? Oh, you poor souls. Did you never know that having a brown skin could be your sin. From all parts of the country reports are coming in of hate crimes against people purported to be Arabs.\nShootings. Racial epithets. Discrimination. What an unholy mess have we got into. So now will I too have to constantly watch my back. And front. And sides. How is that possible?\nISIS: Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. George W. rammed his truck into Iraq, handing power to the Shiites, who proceeded to persecute the minority Sunnis, who rebelled, and IS in Iraq was born.\nThe Shiite Assad started bombing his majority Sunni population in Syria, aided and abetted by the Russians, who sent in their latest jets to polish off the task. IS in Syria was born.\nThe UN estimates over half a million killed in Iraq, and between two-three million people who have fled the country. In Syria, over five million displaced from their country. No credible estimates as to how many killed, because no credible agency has the guts to enter that hellhole.\nAnd Trump says he wants to join hands with Putin to defeat ISIS. First you create Frankenstein, and then you think you yourself will be able to smash it.\nThe list goes on and on. Sure, you want manufacturing and software jobs back in the US. Sure, impose tariffs. But remember why they went overseas in the first place: Because they could be done cheaper, better, faster there. And then other countries won’t hesitate to erect reciprocal barriers for you. Good luck then.\nAnd then there was the groping video. Ok, sure, locker-room talk. We all indulge in it, don’t we? But mocking a New York Times reporter with a visible disability at a public rally? Or mocking the ethnicity of a judge with Mexican heritage?\nIt finally hit home, when a cousin, a senior doctor in Delhi, told me he was worried about what Trump would do to India. Wow. India and the US, aren’t they natural allies? If accomplished people in India start worrying like this, then imagine what the rest of the world is thinking.\nI rest my case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T08:19:04.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
