I’m not a size two. It’s okay to look good and feel good and I’m strong. It’s okay to look strong and to be sexy and to be a woman and to be unbreakable — all those things,\" she said in a filmed interview for the magazine.

I want them to be like, 'I look good too.' That’s what I hope for.\" \nThe tennis star added that it took a while to get used to posing in such a skimpy pair of bottoms. \n\"I’ve never worn a thong bikini, so for that to be my first shot was like a shot of espresso for me because I had to wake up immediately.\" \nShe continued: \"The thong is perfect, it really made me feel comfortable. I'm officially a thong girl now!\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:20:57.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
