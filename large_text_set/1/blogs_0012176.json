writers, FOX SPORTS  07am \nAUSTRALIA have called on the uncapped leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson as part of a four-strong spin contingent to end a 13-year wait for success in India, while under-pressure trio Matt Wade, Glenn Maxwell and Shaun Marsh have also earned spots on the plane. \nIn a bid to exploit the spin-friendly conditions expected on the four-Test tour, Swepson joins Steve O’Keefe and Ashton Agar to support lead spinner Nathan Lyon, while both Marsh brothers — Shaun and Mitchell — worked their way into the squad on the back of experience in the subcontinent. \nSwepson’s selection comes out of the blue with the 23-year-old having played just 14 first class matches, taking 41 wickets at 33 runs apiece. \nBut he has been endorsed by the spin king himself, Shane Warne, and that appears to have been viewed favourably by selectors. \nSwepson starred for Australia A against India A last year and it is understood Darren Lehmann is desperate for more variety from his spinners. \nMaxwell won his battle with Travis Head to be the team’s spinning all-rounder and favourite for the No. 6 batting role in the Australian XI. \nMaxwell has not played Test cricket since 2014 but, due to his skill against spinners and ability to chip in with handy off-spin, he is considered something of a subcontinental specialist and a potential game-breaker who can turn a match in Australia’s favour while batting as low as No. 7 in the order. media_camera Mitchell Swepson bowling during the Big Bash League. \nThe enigmatic 28-year-old is also a world-class fieldsman. \nWade was under serious pressure to retain his spot as the team’s wicketkeeper, with his hit-and-miss performances behind the stumps and indifferent form with the bat prompting calls for a return of the recently dumped Peter Nevill. \nWade’s timely — and outstanding — maiden one-day international century in a matchwinning performance against Pakistan at the Gabba on Friday allayed some fears over his patchy summer and put to bed Nevill’s bid for a recall. \nIncumbent all-rounder Hilton Cartwright, who scored a steady 37 during his debut in the SCG Test earlier this month, has been unceremoniously dumped after bowling just four overs in his first Test. \nInstead, selectors have opted for the more experienced Mitchell Marsh. \nMarsh was dumped after Australia’s Hobart nadir, but selectors appreciate his improving value with the ball and he is seen as a viable seam option should Australia choose to play an additional spinner while still wanting to bat as deep as possible. \nShaun Marsh joins the batting ranks along with the top five which performed so admirably throughout the Pakistan whitewash, but is expected to duel with young gun Matt Renshaw for the right to open alongside David Warner. \nOn the fast-bowling front, Australia will be led by the world’s No. 1 Test quick — Josh Hazlewood — with Mitchell Starc and Jackson Bird in support. \nAustralia will fly to India next month for the four-Test series, kicking off in Pune on February 23. \nFollow our live blog an join in the discussion below.. \nTEST SQUAD", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T06:07:00.000+02:00",
