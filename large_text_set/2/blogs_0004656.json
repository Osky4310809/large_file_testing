For context, Chester Pitts wore a suit and rapper Ja Rule donned matching camouflage separates; \"upscale\" camo print, naturally. \nMost women opted for fitted dresses, nice tops with skinny jeans, and heels. A few, including yours truly, rocked motorcycle boots. \nClick through the slideshow to see how Houston dressed up for the week's biggest dance party - thus far, anyway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:21:56.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
