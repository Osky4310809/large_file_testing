That’s up 1 percent poll from the last PPIC survey in February.\nOr, as Arnold Schwarzenegger might say , “you’re dying at the box office.”\nNot surprisingly, attitudes toward Trump break sharply along party lines, with 82 percent of Republicans approving of the president’s performance, while 91 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of independents disapprove.\nNearly 60 percent of Californians asked disapprove when it comes to Trump’s signature issues: building a wall by the Mexican border (72 percent disapprove) and banning travel from six mostly Muslim countries (58 percent disapprove).\nTrump’s overall tone on immigrants isn’t resonating with Californians, said survey director Mark Baldassare.\n“Californians feel that undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. should have a chance to apply for citizenship, they should be allowed to stay, and there’s very little support for requiring that undocumented immigrants leave the country,” said Baldassare. “As far as Californians are concerned, that issue was settled quite a while ago.”\nIn fact, the PPIC survey found that 68 percent of Californians surveyed think undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. should be allowed to stay and eventually apply for citizenship — even 46 percent of Republicans in California agree with that.\n\nA new survey by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) finds that 68 percent of Californians think undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. should be allowed to stay and eventually apply for citizenship. (Courtesy of PPIC) President Trump’s positions on a wide range of issues “aren’t consistent with where Californians are today,” said Baldassare.\nCalifornia officials are viewed much more favorably, with 61 percent of likely voters in the state giving Jerry Brown a thumbs up for the job he’s doing as governor.\nThe governor fares better than the state’s two U.S. senators. Fifty-one percent of likely voters approve of the job Sen. Dianne Feinstein is doing, with 39 percent disapproving. (Note: The poll was conducted before Feinstein’s high-profile role in the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch).\n\nMeanwhile, freshman Sen. Kamala Harris wins approval from 49 percent of likely voters, while 25 percent say they don’t know enough to have an opinion.
