At this time, however, there are no vacancies, according to the Staten Island Borough President’s office. \n\"Community boards may be New York City's most grassroots level of government,” Brewer said, “but they are deeply involved in our city's biggest policy questions.” \nWhat else you need to know to apply: \n► To serve on a community board, you must be a New York City resident and live or work or have some of professional stake or “significant interest” in that area. \n► Boards now accept applicants as young as 16 thanks to a 2015 state law. \n► Terms of service are two years. \n► You apply through your borough president’s office, which appoints members. Half of the members are selected by borough presidents and half are nominated by City Council members. \n► Terms begin in April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T17:55:25.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
