P exclusively tells HipHopDX that the film’s rollout will be special — not just for its true “rag to riches” story but for the legacy it will create. \n“This King of the South biopic will be like the next classic after the Tupac All Eyez on Me biopic [which releases this summer],” P tells HipHopDX. “I want all the people to get excited because it’s coming real soon.” \nThe casting tour will conclude in P’s hometown New Orleans on April 4. The movie will begin filming this summer and the veteran music mogul also reveals to HipHopDX he hopes for its release to come in January on Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday next year. \nDuring an April 2016 conversation with HipHopDX, Master P let the cat out the bag that Queen Latifah had been added to the film’s cast , with veteran actor Wendell Pierce following suit shortly after. \nCheck out the flicks from the King of the South biopic casting call down below.
