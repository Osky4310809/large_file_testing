Seeking ways to charm Donald Trump, he hit on the ideal solution — present this most conceited of presidents with a picture of himself.\nOn their first call, Trump revealed he knew the elder Trudeau — a “dapper dude,” in the words of the president. Hence, when the prime minister arrived at the White House Monday, Trump was handed a picture of himself with Pierre Trudeau at a banquet in New York City in 1981.\nTrump was also presented with a beautiful, hand-carved stone lion from the Arms of Canada. It was received without comment, but the president did remark on the picture and Trudeau’s father, “who I knew and respected greatly.” \nThe lion sculpture gifted to Trump – carved by Colleen Wilson of RJW Stonemasons of Ottawa. pic.twitter.com/pgeCSEZdID \n— John Ivison (@IvisonJ) February 13, 2017 \n\nIt proved a propitious gesture that set the tone for a day that went better than anyone in the Trudeau camp could possibly have hoped.\nThe two men spoke publicly about the things upon which they agreed — trade, security, energy, middle-class jobs — and were resolutely silent upon the things on which they might fall out — the environment, immigration policy, softwood lumber.\nConservative leadership candidate Kevin O’Leary had suggested that Trudeau versus Trump would be like Bambi versus Godzilla. In fact, it was more like Winnie the Pooh and Piglet — “We’ll be friends forever, won’t we, Pooh?” asked Piglet; “Even longer,” answered Pooh.\nTrump was calm — almost becalmed — sticking to his speaking notes and making clear that he would like to see harmonious relations.\nCanada PM @JustinTrudeau gave @realDonaldTrump 1981 photo of Trump speaking at a dinner honoring Trudeau's father, former PM Pierre Trudeau. pic.twitter.com/3C7WPZbbmr \n— Josh Wingrove (@josh_wingrove) February 13, 2017 \n\n“The U.S. is deeply fortunate to have a neighbour like Canada,” he said. The two countries should co-ordinate more closely to protect jobs, keep wealth on the continent and keep everyone safe, he added.\nWhen he was offered the chance to skewer Canada for absorbing so many of the Syrian refugees that he considers a danger to American security, he demurred, saying only “you can never be totally confident” about border security.\nTrudeau was polite but not prostrate. The NDP urged him to stand up for Canadian values, and tell Trump publicly that Canadians are opposed to a policy that turns away immigrants and refugees based on their religion.\nHad he done so, he would have scored political points at home. But this visit was about securing Canada’s privileged trading relationship, not playing domestic politics.\nWe are party to an asymmetric alliance, in which we depend on exports to the U.S. for 23 per cent of our GDP, while their exports north account for just two per cent of their economy.\nThe prime minister boxed clever, saying that the last thing Canadians would expect him to do is visit another country and lecture them on how to govern themselves.\nAt the same time, he said he will always “reflect the Canadian approach” and provide an example to the world. Canada’s self-respect remained intact, as did the special relationship with the United States. Well played, sir.\nRelated Trump will 'tweak' NAFTA elements affecting Canada, calling Mexico the bigger concern Did Donald Trump really know Pierre Trudeau and respect him greatly? A review of the evidence. After private drinks with Trump, his trusted friend levels a public critique: ‘Reince is the problem’ The two men are unlikely to become golfing buddies, like Jean Chrétien and Bill Clinton, but neither is Trump going to grab Trudeau by the collar and accuse him of “pissing on my rug,” as Lyndon Johnson famously did to Lester Pearson, after the latter made a speech critical of America’s conduct of the Vietnam War.\nTrudeau quoted Winston Churchill, who spoke admiringly about the long Canada-U.S. frontier “guarded only by neighbourly respect.”\nTrump reciprocated by dialling back the protectionist rhetoric. The two countries have a “very outstanding” trade relationship, he said. NAFTA may require some “tweaking” but the reforms will be much less severe than those envisaged on the southern border with Mexico, the president said. That doesn’t sound like the border adjustment tax that would prove so disastrous for Canada.\nOn infrastructure, the two countries said in a joint statement they will encourage opportunities for companies on both sides of the border. That doesn’t sound like an expanded Buy American program targeting Canadian companies.\nThere were positive noises made about “thinning” the border in areas where Canada would like to see action — labour mobility, pre-clearance of people and cargo, integration of border operations into common processing facilities.\nThere were suggestions that Canada might commit to more defence spending by working to modernize NORAD in cyberspace and space; committing to a competition to permanently replace the CF18 fighter jets; and enhancing its military contribution against ISIL and in Latvia. Both sides could claim wins here.\nIt’s early days yet. Even Trump probably doesn’t know what he wants on trade — his team, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, have not cleared the Senate confirmation process.\nBut the foundations have been laid — by civility and flattery — upon which a constructive rapport can be built. As a bonus, Trudeau also spent time with House Speaker Paul Ryan, with whom he had a relaxed conversation about trade and hockey, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n“We’re going to have a great relationship — as good or better than ever before,” said the president.\nComing from a man who doesn’t mind criticism, provided it’s in the form of an unvarnished compliment, this was a very good start.\nNational Post \n• Email: jivison@nationalpost.com | Twitter: IvisonJ \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:23:58.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
