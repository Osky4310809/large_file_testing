Friends and families are all talking about it, so even if I don’t want to hear them, it’s always around and it’s making me insane,” Iranian refugee Amir told BuzzFeed News.\n“Everyone feels so hopeless and helpless.”\nThis is will be Amir’s fourth year detained on Manus since he sought asylum in Australia in 2013 after fleeing religious persecution for being Christian in Iran.\nUnder Australia’s strict immigration regime, all asylum-seekers who attempt to reach Australia by boat are detained offshore, never to set foot on Australian soil.\nAmir is one of the many refugees held in Australian detention with a nationality now banned under Trump’s recent immigration suspension.\nSo the 24-year-old was unsurprised when Trump suggested on Thursday that he was reconsidering the deal for the United States to take around 1,250 refugees from Australia.\nTrump tweeted that the Obama-era deal was “dumb”, and a Washington Post report painted a disastrous picture of the negotiations between the US and Australia. Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ID: 10454872 Within an hour of the tweet being sent, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull took to Sydney radio to declare: “The president assured me that he would continue to honour the agreement we entered into with the Obama administration with respect to refugee resettlement.”\nOn Friday morning, the Trump administration said the deal would go ahead “out of respect” for Australia.\nBut Amir now believes it is “highly unlikely” that the US will accept any refugees from Manus Island or Nauru, where there are still 372 people living in a regional processing centre, according to the latest Australian government statistics.\n“Trump’s message was clear from the first day of his campaign and I still can’t believe how Turnbull can look into people’s eyes and give them misleading information,” Amir, who fled Iran aged 15, said.\nAmir, who sleeps in a crowded tent with 40 other men every night, has also given up all hope of resettlement in Australia.
