ADVERTISEMENT \nThe chamber noted that it was an organization that “protects the interest and promotes the Philippines as an investment hub for Korean businessmen.” \nIt called on the authorities to thoroughly investigate the crime and bring the perpetrators to justice. \nIn what sounded like a veiled warning, the group stressed that Filipinos living and working in South Korea are protected by their government. \n“In South Korea, we strongly protect the welfare and respect almost 50,000 overseas Filipino workers; we expect and hope that the Philippine authorities’ doubled efforts to prevent this kind of incident to happen again and to assure the safety and welfare of Koreans here in the Philippines,” the statement read. \nIn Pampanga, leaders of the Angeles Korean Community Association (Akca) here were tight-lipped on Tuesday when they attended a dialog with city councilors. \nNumbering more than 2,000, Koreans either do business in the city or work in companies based in Clark Freeport. Some are enrolled in local colleges or golf schools. \n“We’ve been advised by our embassy to refrain from making statements,” Sheng Kae Lee, vice president of Akca, said to explain his group’s reservations about speaking up. \nVice Mayor Bryan Matthew Nepomuceno said that based on conversations with several Korean residents, there was a “growing concern about peace and order.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:11:15.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
