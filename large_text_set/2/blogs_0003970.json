And it offers provocation after provocation.” \nNetanyahu said “that’s why I welcome President Trump’s insistence on new sanctions against Iran.” \n“I think other nations should follow suit, certainly responsible nations, and I’d like to talk to you about how we can ensure Iran’s aggression does not go unanswered,” he said, adding that he and his country share a “desire for peace” with the British people. \nA Downing Street spokesperson told CNN that Britain is concerned about Iran’s recent missile test. \n“It was discussed at the UN and we made clear our position,” the spokesperson said. “With regard to the specific agreement relating to the nuclear weapons … it’s important that it is very carefully and rigorously policed. We should also be clear that it has neutralized the possibility of the Iranians acquiring nuclear weapons for more than a decade.” \nThe Independent called Netanyahu’s use of the so-called “warm words” between the two leaders in front of the cameras to make his case against Iran an “unusual step.” Rate this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:30:59.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
