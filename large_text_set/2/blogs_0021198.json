However, it was considered overkill at the time as there weren’t any apps to make the most of it. Seeing how VR has finally kicked off and has several applications in development, a lot of buzz has been going around smartphones with 8GB of RAM. Therefore, we decided to round up the top phones expected to be announced which will ship with 8GB of RAM. Read on to find more. ASUS Zenfone AR \nThe recently announced ASUS ZenFone AR has a lot of firsts going for it, but being the spec-obsessed community that we are, we’re excited to tell you that the smartphone comes with 8GB of RAM, and is the very first to boast this spec. While some might write it off as overkill, bear in mind that the smartphone is intended to work fluidly with AR and VR apps, which require a lot of memory. Therefore, the ASUS ZenFone AR can use all the horsepower it can get. The smartphone will ship in a 6GB RAM variant too and is powered by a Snapdragon 821 SoC. The device gets a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED quad HD panel, and sources its power from a 3,300mAh battery. Vernee Apollo 2 \nShenzhen-based smartphone maker Vernee announced that it will launch the first Mediatek Helio X30-powered phone at MWC this year. The smartphone has been subjected to several leaks since the announcement giving insight into its specifications. The Apollo 2 will reportedly ship in two different configurations of 6GB/8GB RAM, and will sport a Quad HD display of unknown size. The X30 processor powering the device will reportedly feature 10 physical cores and will allegedly come with a IMG 7XTP-Mt4 GPU clocked at 820 MHz. OnePlus 4 \nThe popular Chinese manufacturer recently launched the OnePlus 3T ( review ) which featured slightly improved internals over its sibling, the OnePlus 3 ( review ). However, the company’s next smartphone won’t be an iterative update and will feature some pretty impressive specs. The device is rumoured to come with 8 gigs of RAM and will reportedly be powered by a Snapdragon 835 chip. The phone is also said to come with a 5.3-inch Quad HD display which will be a first for the company seeing how none of its current offerings boast a resolution higher than 1080p. Backing the high res display will be a 4,000mAh battery which will undoubtedly come with OnePlus’s signature Dash charge technology. HTC 11 \nHTC’s flagships haven’t made a huge impact for quite some time now. However, the company hopes to reverse its fortunes with the HTC 11, which is expected to feature 8GB of RAM and a dual-camera setup at the back. The smartphone will allegedly come with a 5.5-inch Quad HD display and will be powered by a Snapdragon 835 processor. A 3,700mAh will be housed within the smartphone’s all-metal body with the device expected to boot Android Nougat upon boot. Samsung Galaxy Note8 \nWhile many believed that Samsung has decided to scrap the entire Note series after the Galaxy Note7 fiasco, recent reports from the company’s home market in South Korea suggest otherwise. The Samsung Galaxy Note8 is expected to feature a 4K panel along with a redesigned S-pen. The device will ship with the latest processor at the time of its launch and will also come sporting 8GB of RAM.
