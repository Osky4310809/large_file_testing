Just seconds after he climbed onto the stage, he was pushed by Badass. \nVideo of the incident shows Wilburn sink into the crowd after being shoved by the New York City MC as what seems to be a Hillary Clinton impersonator struts on the stage. \nAs a result of the fall, Wilburn says he had to dole out $1,000 in medical expenses, and might also need to pay up to $25,000 if surgery is needed. It is unclear what injuries he suffered from following the fall. \nAdditionally, the Trump impersonator claims he’ll lose around $50,000 because of his injuries and is seeking $1.5 million in damages.
