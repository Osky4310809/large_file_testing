She’d met her husband Jonathan at school, but less than two years after their wedding, another marine had won her heart. Erin, 19, was having an affair with her married neighbour, Christopher Lee, and when she fell pregnant, she was thrilled. \nErin told friends there was a good chance the baby was her lover’s, but when Christopher found out, reality hit. The affair threatened to destroy his reputation and he risked losing his wife and young daughter. He couldn’t let that happen, so Christopher invited Erin to go hunting in the desert. She thought he was going to propose – but Erin was his prey. \nErin, 19, was married to Cpl Jonathan Corwin, 21, who was stationed at the Twentynine Palms marine base in California, but she’d been having an affair with Christopher for five months. \nChristopher, 24, and his wife Nichole were Erin’s neighbours. The two families were close and Erin even occasionally looked after their six-year-old daughter. They all shared a love of horse riding – but Erin and Christopher had grown especially close. \nIn June 2014, Erin told friends that she was about three weeks pregnant and, despite knowing there was a good chance the baby was Christopher’s, she was thrilled. Just months earlier she’d suffered a miscarriage, so she saw the chance to be a mum as a blessing. Erin also wanted to make things official with Christopher, unaware that he’d go to any lengths to make sure that never happened. Married Jonathan and Erin lived on the same marine base as her lover Christopher (Photo: San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department) Read More Teenager killed her father and then hid his body in the shed so she could have drug-fuelled parties \nOn 28 June, Erin told her husband she was going to the Joshua Tree National Park to look for future trails that she could hike. It was just a few miles from her home in the Mojave Desert. Days before her 20th birthday, she drove away from the base in her Toyota Corolla. She was actually meeting Christopher in the desert, and Erin had told friends she thought he might ask her to marry him. \nWhen she didn’t return, Jonathan reported his wife missing. Rescue teams started an extensive search with sniffer dogs, but it was tough. The area covered over 300-square miles and included over 100 mine shafts. At first, it was thought that she might have lost her way, but after two days, her car was found abandoned just a few blocks from the marine base. Police suspected foul play. \nFor two months, they carried on searching. Christopher was questioned early on when friends of Erin revealed their affair. He said he’d gone to the desert that day, but had gone alone – he also said his relationship with Erin had been nothing more than a kiss. While the hunt for Erin continued, Christopher moved to Alaska with his family. \nOn 16 August, Erin’s body was found at the bottom of a 140ft mine shaft. She had been strangled to death. There were also shell casings that matched Christopher’s gun, steel bars and a propane tank similar to one Christopher owned. \nErin’s remains were too decomposed for medical examiners to confirm whether she was pregnant when she died – but the investigators were in no doubt that Erin had been carrying Christopher’s baby and that’s why he’d killed her. \nHe was arrested in Anchorage, Alaska, the following day and charged with first-degree murder. If a pregnancy had been confirmed, it could have been two murder charges.

At the San Bernardino County Superior Court, he was asked whether he was the one who had strangled Erin, and he replied, \"Yes, I am.\" \nChristopher testified that he’d strangled Erin during a fit of anger, but he was ready to come clean. \n\"I’m no longer scared to tell the truth,\" he said. \"People have to know what I did.\" \nChristopher made a shocking accusation in court. He alleged that Erin had been molesting his young daughter – an accusation with no evidence – and he’d felt an uncontrollable rage. \n\"I made the decision to kill her,\" Lee testified. \"I was controlled by the anger. The hate I felt that day, it was something I never want to experience again.\" \nChristopher said he had been suicidal for months before heading out with Erin, because he’d been denied deployment with the army and had planned to kill himself at the mine shaft. Then Erin had admitted molesting his daughter and he struck. \nHe said he’d approached Erin from behind and strangled her at least five minutes with a garrotte made from two steel bars and a cord. When he released his hold, Erin dropped to the ground. Then Christopher dragged her body to the mine shaft and pushed her in head first.

Erin thought they were going to have a romantic evening together, but instead she’d walked into a trap. The accusation that she’d molested his daughter was completely unfounded and a vile attack on her character. \nThe jury found Christopher, now 27, guilty of first-degree murder. At the sentencing, friends and family read statements outlining their grief, as photos of Erin appeared on a screen. Her husband briefly thanked the court for their efforts, while others spoke of their fond memories. \n\"I feel I should’ve been able to protect Erin somehow,\" her older sister Kristy Bauerlein said. \nHer mother, Lore Heavlin, spoke of how she thought her daughter was safe on a marine base, but she lived near a ‘predator’. \n\"The one thing that haunted me through all this was, what was going through Erin’s mind when she was attacked from behind by someone she trusted?\" she said. \nErin’s mum said the affair didn’t justify her death. \n\"I cannot understand why anyone would think murder is OK, how it would get rid of your problems,\" she said. \"All Chris had to do was move to Alaska and change his phone number.\" \nChristopher told the court he never wanted Erin dead, but said he was ‘truly sorry’ for her murder. \nThe judge sentenced him to life in prison without parole. He addressed Erin’s loved ones. \n\"I’m sorry I can’t give you true justice in this case, which is returning Erin to you,\" he said. \nErin had followed her heart, but sadly it had led her right into a trap.
