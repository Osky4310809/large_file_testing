By Kenneth P. Vogel , David Stern and Michael Crowley 02/03/17 06:27 PM EST Updated 02/03/17 07:00 PM EST \nWhile President Donald Trump suggested during his campaign that he might ease sanctions against Russia related to its aggression against Ukraine, a Ukranian politician said Trump assured her he would do no such thing. | AP Photo Print \nDuring an unusual private meeting on the sidelines of Thursday’s National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump promised a Ukrainian opposition leader that the United States won’t lift sanctions on Russia until it pulls out of Ukraine, according to three people briefed on the meeting. \nWithin hours of meeting with both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the prayer breakfast, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko relayed the contents of the meeting to separate audiences at the Heritage Foundation and the Hudson Institute, according to people who attended the off-the-record events at the conservative think tanks. Story Continued Below \nThe sources said that Tymoshenko, a member of parliament who is positioning herself for a presidential campaign against the beleaguered incumbent president Petro Poroshenko, told the think tanks that Trump assured her he would “not abandon” Ukraine, which claims that Russian troops are responsible for increased fighting in the region near the countries’ shared border. The international community largely supports this view, but Moscow denies it and blames the fighting on pro-Russian separatists. \nWhile Trump had suggested during his campaign that he might be willing to ease sanctions against Russia related to its aggression against Ukraine, Tymoshenko said Trump assured her he would do no such thing — unless Russia withdrew from Ukraine, according to the people who attended the briefings. \nThey said Tymoshenko, who is generally regarded as pro-Western, did not discuss specifics at the think tank events, which were by invitation only and were closed to the press. Notably, it was unclear whether the conditions indicated by Trump to Tymoshenko for lifting sanctions included Russian withdrawal from Crimea, a Ukrainian territory to the country’s south, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and what Trump would consider a Russian withdrawal from eastern Ukraine, where Moscow has provided the separatists with arms and other support. By Andrew Restuccia and Josh Dawsey \nStill, one person who heard from Tymoshenko after the prayer breakfast, said “she definitely came away from her little tete-a-tete with Trump feeling somewhat calmer about the situation.” \nAnd Tymoshenko’s characterization of her meetings with Trump and Pence would seem to mark a harsher tone towards Russia than the new president previously has struck publicly. \nA Trump White House official would not discuss the specifics of the meeting, instead explaining “the President and the former Prime Minister had a brief, informal photo-op meeting in the reception before the National Prayer Breakfast. While no formal assurances were given, the United States remains concerned about violence in Eastern Ukraine.” \nWhile Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley this week rebuked Russia and declared the U.S. would leave in place its sanctions related to the annexation of Crimea, Trump himself has been much less confrontational. \nTrump has expressed admiration for Russian president Vladimir Putin, indicated a willingness to consider easing the sanctions and at times disputed U.S. intelligence findings that Russian intelligence facilitated cyberattacks on Democratic officials and groups in an effort to boost Trump’s campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s Treasury Department this week tweaked sanctions levied by the Obama administration on a Russian spy agency in retaliation for the alleged cyberattacks. \nA spokesman for the Heritage Foundation said “we do not discuss the deliberations of private meetings at Heritage,” while a spokeswoman for the Hudson Institute did not respond to requests for comment. By Nancy Cook and Josh Dawsey \nThe Ukrainian embassy in Washington also did not respond to requests for comment. \nBut in foreign policy circles in Washington and Kiev, the Tymoshenko-Trump meeting was the subject of intense debate for its possible signals about Trump’s policy towards Ukraine and Russia, and also for its potential ramifications on Ukrainian domestic politics. \nIn both capitals, the meeting was seen as a major coup for Tymoshenko and an embarrassment for Poroshenko. The Ukrainianpresident, whose approval ratings have been soft, has been working assiduously to secure his own meeting with Trump, and has publicly suggested that such a meeting was imminent. \n“I was one of the first world leaders to whom President Trump called immediately after the election, and we had quite a promising conversation.” Poroshenko last month told Bloomberg TV in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. “We agreed that immediately after inauguration, we agreed the date of my visit to Washington, D.C., and the agenda of our negotiations would be quite big.” \nThe Washington lobbying and consulting firm retained by a Poroshenko-linked group sought to minimize the Tymoshenko meeting. \n“According to participants in the Prayer Breakfast, Ms. Tymoshenko waited for President Trump in a corridor next to the restroom in the hope of catching him for a moment for a handshake,” said Jeff Birnbaum, president of BGR Public Relations, which represents the National Reform Council of Ukraine. “No real meeting took place. The President shook hands with many people and apparently one of them was Ms. Tymoshenko.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:38:14.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
