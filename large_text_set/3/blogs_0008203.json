Last week, Ocean handed the reins over to guest DJs and didn't really appear on the show at all. This week, we had a new Ocean track, \" Chanel .\" It played 18 times in a row. \nThere was deviation hidden in the middle of all those loops, though. About 45 minutes in, A$AP Rocky showed up on the track with his own verse; it came through just once more in the remaining fifteen minutes. So, in case you were entirely hypnotized by the repetition of Frank's melodies, listen to A$AP Rocky's remix of \"Chanel\" below. His verse comes in around the 3:40 mark. \nFollow Noisey on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T19:30:07.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
