But it’s a hard race to win and some of the best drivers in NASCAR history have never managed to win it. But when the field lines up on Sunday (2 p.m. ET, FOX) for the 59 th running of the Daytona 500, there are going to be at least eight drivers who’ve never won this race but have excellent shots this year. Here are eight drivers we think have honest chances to win their first Daytona 500. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 8 Austin Dillon Last year, Dillon was the only driver to finish in the top 10 in all four restrictor-plate points races in the Cup series. Sooner or later, he’s going to win one of them. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 7 Clint Bowyer Nobody has had a bigger smile so far during Speedweeks than Bowyer, who is understandably thrilled to be in fast Stewart-Haas Racing Fords. Keep an eye on him on Sunday. 6 Chase Elliott Yes, we know: This is just the second Daytona 500 start for Elliott. But both have come from the pole and Elliott will be flanked by his Hendrick Motorsports teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. Getty Images Getty Images 5 Kasey Kahne Hard to believe, perhaps, but Kahne has never won a points race at a restrictor-plate track. But the Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolets were fast in qualifying, so maybe that streak will end on Sunday. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 4 Kurt Busch Another stellar driver who shockingly has never won a restrictor-plate race, Busch pushed then-Penske teammate Ryan Newman to victory in the 2008 Daytona 500. Through no fault of his own, Busch got wrecked out of the Advance Auto Parts Clash. 3 Martin Truex Jr. Last year, Truex came within 0.010 seconds of winning the Daytona 500, finishing second to Denny Hamlin. He will be eager to avenge that loss this year. “I will have to relive that moment the rest of my career unless I win it,” Truex said of the 500. And he’ right. John David Mercer John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports 2 Kyle Busch Last year Busch finished third behind his Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Denny Hamlin and runner-up Martin Truex Jr. It would shock no one if he won this year, especially not after his strong runner-up performance in the Advance Auto Parts Clash on Sunday. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 1 Brad Keselowski This one is actually very surprising because Keselowski is one of the absolute best restrictor-plate racers among active drivers. Keselowski made a ballsy, but unsuccessful last-lap pass for the lead in the Advance Auto Parts Clash and he’ll be all in again in the Daytona 500.
