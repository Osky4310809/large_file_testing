It was normal full-fat coke.\n‘She got really hyper like a kid would.. She loved it she was so alert.\n‘She wouldn’t drink a whole glass, it was the little bit at the bottom of the glass – around an inch.\n‘She was getting a bit hyper and I thought it was a bit weird for a dog to be drinking. She went cold turkey and was shaking like she needed it.\n‘She went to bed every night with a glass of Coke, when I stopped giving it to her she got very upset and was very grouchy.’\nLady has now kicked her Coke habit (Picture: SWNS) The mum-of-one added: ‘I don’t want people thinking I am a bad owner, far from it she is spoilt.\n‘Her teeth were not very good anyway. I hope it’s not because of drinking Coke. I think it was just old-age.\n‘The teeth they took out I keep in a pot – there are 12 of them. She has a couple at the back but that’s about it. She is really gummy.’\nThe new 12-sided £1 coin enters circulation today Lady stopped drinking cola around three years ago but still enjoys white chocolate buttons, flapjacks and cups of tea.\nNot ideal, according to the RSPCA.\nA spokesperson for the animal charity told Metro.co.uk: ‘Water is the only drink which dogs need. Giving them sugary drinks or food risks causing them health problems.’\nLady had been suffering terribly with her teeth and was in a lot of pain, so Kate, who has another Jack Russell called Ted, four, decided surgery was the best way forward.\nIt was a big decision to go ahead with the op for a dog of her age, with fears she may not have come out of the anaesthetic.\n \n‘She’s like a different dog, far more playful and bright, she is a lovely dog and I can’t bear the thought of losing her,’ added Kate.\nThe Coke made Lady quite hyper (Picture: SWNS) Kate has kept her pet’s teeth (Picture: SWNS) More: UK Boy, 4, must spend 20 hours a day under bright lights to treat rare liver disease \nShocking pictures show young cows crammed into cages at M&S dairy farm \nMan goes on rant after seeing woman breastfeed at the pub \n‘She was in a lot of pain and she had to have the op, but I was very nervous for her.’\nKate has kept all Lady’s 12 removed teeth in a jar at home.\nVet Dr Clara Greenwood from Ashman Jones Vets in Bath, who carried out the operation, said: ’20 is a fantastic age for a dog.\n‘Lady was a very brave little doggy and recovered well from her anaesthetic.\n‘She is doing really well after the op and enjoying life much better, it definitely was the best thing for her.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:39:55.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
