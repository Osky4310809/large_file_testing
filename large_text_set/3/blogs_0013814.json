You can buy one today — this minute! — if you can find one . \nThe Nintendo Switch operates as a home console and a portable console, as seen above in both formats. Nintendo \nAlongside the new console, Nintendo's got a handful of games for you to play. \nBut let's be real here — you're buying Switch for \"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,\" right? The gorgeous new \"Zelda\" game that's being heralded by critics as an instant classic? \nNintendo \nThat's totally reasonable. It's a very, very good game! But after you're through exploring the massive kingdom of Hyrule, you'll likely want something else to play on the $300 console you bought. \nAnd that's what we've got below: options! Though the Switch's game lineup right now is a bit on the light side, there's still a mess of great stuff to play. Check it out: 1. \"Snipperclips\" Nintendo \nAside from having a goofy name, \"Snipperclips\" is a charming two-player game that utilizes the Nintendo Switch gamepad — the \"Joy-Con\" — in a smart way. \nEach player gets one Joy-Con, and you use them as miniature gamepads (held sideways) to control one of two aggressively-silly characters on screen. You can \"cut\" each of the two characters into various shapes, which can then be used to solve whatever puzzle is in front of you. I've found it to be the perfect foil to the hours-long single-player experience in \"Breath of the Wild\" — quick bursts of fun co-op gameplay as compared to lengthy play sessions, alone, in \"Breath of the Wild.\" \nPerhaps best of all, it's just $19.99. \nPrice: $19.99 2. \"Fast RMX\" Shin'en Multimedia \nSimilarly with \"Snipperclips,\" the futuristic arcade-style racing game \"Fast RMX\" provides a much-needed alternative to \"Zelda.\" On a console otherwise bereft of high-speed racing games, \"Fast RMX\" stands out as a great racer that evokes nostalgia for the days of \"F-Zero\" on the SNES, \"Wipeout\" on the original PlayStation, and even some light touches of \"Mario Kart\" thrown in for good measure. It's also a stark graphical showcase for the notably tiny Switch console. \nPrice: $19.99 3. \"Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment\" / \"Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove\" Yacht Club Games \nWhen \"Shovel Knight\" originally launched in 2014, it received wide acclaim for being a ridiculously fun update to a formula popularized in the 16-bit era by games like \"Castlevania.\" Since that initial launch, the game has spawned countless ports — it's on everything , from the Nintendo Wii U to Amazon's Fire TV — and even a few sequels. \nOn the Switch, you have two different options for \"Shovel Knight\" — the $9.99 standalone sequel, named \"Specter of Torment,\" or the $24.99 bundle, which includes the original \"Shovel Knight,\" as well as \"Plague of Shadows\" and \"Specter of Torment.\" Both are good options, though if you've played \"Shovel Knight\" before, you're probably just looking for the new sequel. \nPrice: $9.99 / $24.99 4. \"The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+\" Nicalis \nLike \"Shovel Knight,\" the \"Binding of Isaac\" games are an homage to an era of gaming that's long passed. You play as young Isaac, who's dealing with some pretty serious personal demons that manifest in the form of actual demons. The long and short is that it's a top-down shooting game, but that's really underselling the level of depth in this game. If you haven't already played it on one of the many other platforms it's on, scooping it on the Switch is a solid choice. \nPrice: $39.99", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T14:51:03.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
