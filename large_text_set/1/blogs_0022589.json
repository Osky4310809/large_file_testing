Trump demands it Updated: January 23, 2017 — 8:03 PM EST Share Will Bunch Daily News Columnist Will Bunch has worked at the Daily News for 20-plus years and is now senior writer. Since 2005, he’s written the uber-opinionated, fair-but-dangerously unbalanced opinion blog \"Attytood,\" covering a range of topics (but mostly politics and the media these days); it’s been named best blog in the state by the Associated Press Managing Editors and best blog in the city by Philadelphia Magazine. He’s also authored three full-length books and three Amazon Kindle Single e-books, including 2015’s The Bern Identity: A Search for Bernie Sanders and the New American Dream. Prior to coming to Philadelphia, he worked at New York Newsday, where he was part of a team that won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for spot news reporting. More by Will Bunch \nI guess scheduling was never my strong suit. For a guy who went out for his high school paper more than four decades ago with this hope of someday chronicling the momentous events of my future lifetime, it was unfortunate and a little odd to take a two-week medical leave during a) the inauguration of the 45th, and most unlikely ever, U.S. president b) violent clashes in the streets of the capital c) the painful-to-watch installation of the worst and least qualified cabinet in America's 240-year history d) a web of exploding scandals involving the new president's conflicts-of-interest and possible unsavory ties to Russia e) a U.S. government declaring war on the truth with \" alternative facts \" and f) last, but not least, more than 3 million marching \nBoth of those things required a lot of getting used to, but slowly, unevenly, I adjusted. And so on Jan. 10, my doctors brought me back for the follow-up operation they call \"the reversal.\" That meant was time for things to start moving in the right direction again. It was only 11 days later, as I continued to recover, that I magically watched another \"reversal\" begin on the national state -- 3 million people, maybe even 4 million, marching in the right direction through the foggy streets of D.C. and in the midday darkness of frigid villages in the Alaskan Arctic , filling bridges across the red rivers of Nashville and standing up for sisterhood at the very bottom of the world in Antarctica \nSpeaking of Antarctica, there's a layer of irony here about as thick as that massive glacier that's about to break off any day now. For as long as anyone can remember, pundits and social critics have bemoaned the lack of civic participation in American life. They call it \" bowling alone \nDonald Trump came to Washington and \nIn 1961, John F. Kennedy assured \"every nation\" that the United States \"shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any \nIn 1933, in what could be called the mother of all modern inaugural addresses , Franklin Roosevelt told Americans that \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" In 2017, Trump told the nation to be afraid...very afraid. He spoke of \"rusted out factories scattered like tombstones...and the gangs and the d \nIn 1961, JFK exhorted: \"My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\" In 2017, Trump has asked American citizens to put all of their proverbial eggs in one basket -- the basket of Trump, the \"smart\" and benevolent Dear Leader. As he told last summer's RNC, after laying out an exaggerated and at times dishonest portrait of American lawlessness, \" I alone can fix it \nIn other words, don't ask what you can do for your country, but ask what Trump can do for you. Or, better yet, don't ask us at all. Just trust us to tell you the truth in the form of \"alternative facts,\" whether it's about the largest crowd ever at Friday's inauguration (it wasn't) or whether Trump has resigned from his family businesses ( maybe...who knows \nTo millions of Americans, Donald Trump is now that existential threat -- from his cruel health-care mandate to keep 18 million people away from a doctor, to his daily assaults on democratic norms, such as informing the nation's spies on Saturday that journalists exercising their 1st Amendment rights are \" the most dishonest human beings on earth \nJFK asked us, politely and eloquently, to give back to our country. Trump, in all his vainglorious rudeness, demands it of us. Many words have already written about how the pressures of the Oval Office will test a TV-reality-star-turned-POTUS, but we all know that nothing will ever change Donal \nOn Saturday, millions of marchers passed the first pop quiz with flying colors. But that was just the beginning of the beginning. For America to thrive, everyday people need to let those handful of House Republicans in moderate districts who weren't Trump fans -- yes, I'm looking right at you, U.S. Rep.
