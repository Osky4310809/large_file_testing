Chris Coleman's side famously defied the odds to beat tournament favourites Belgium en route to reaching the semi-finals. \nIt was the first major tournament Wales had qualified for since 1958. And the qualification became especially poignant when the Wales players had to overcome the death of former manager Gary Speed. \nThe documentary encapsulates the emotional and brave run Wales had in 2016. The Wales boys were in good spirits during the tournament Bale was crucial to Wales's success \nDirector Owen had previously brought us the superb 'I Believe In Miracles', which was the story about the Nottingham Forest side who won back-to-back European Cups in 1979 and 1980. \nAs seen in the above trailer, Owen has managed to grab personal, one-on-one interviews with key players Gareth Bale, Ashley Williams and Aaron Ramsey - as well as coach Coleman. Captain fantastic: Ashley Williams It was an emotional rollercoaster \nIn the trailer, Wales captain Williams says he's never felt a connection with the fans like he did during Euro 2016. \nThe film is being released in Wales and select cinemas on St David’s Day, 1st March, before it’s general release around the UK on 3rd March. poll loading Will you be watching 'Don't Take Me Home'? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:36:38.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
