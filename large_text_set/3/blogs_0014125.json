Rudiger is rated at £30m (Photo: AFP) City are desperate for defensive reinforcements (Photo: Getty) \nRudiger’s versatility in being able to play right-back as well as centre-back gives him even more value to Guardiola, who is looking for defenders who can adapt to a variety of roles. \nCity boss Guardiola knows Rudiger well from his time at Bayern Munich, when the defender was playing for Stuttgart, before making the switch to Roma in a deal worth around £8m. \nGuardiola knows he must embark on a defensive rebuild, with City’s humiliating last 16 Champions League exit to Monaco confirming the need for a complete overhaul at the back. \nSkipper Vincent Kompany is likely to be offloaded this summer, with Guardiola unwilling to trust the 30-year-old given his ongoing injury and fitness issues. \nBacary Sagna, Gael Clichy and Pablo Zabaleta are all out of contract this summer and unlikely to be offered extensions, meaning City are in the market for at least four new defenders.
