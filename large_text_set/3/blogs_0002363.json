Bush. It was a generous gesture, but I think more so that it is a gift that was a much-needed morale boost to the press in the face of the unprecedented obstacles they are currently facing in today‚Äôs political and societal climate.

Especially for the Truth part.‚Äù \nYes. Yes, to this. Thank you, Mr. Hanks, for standing up for the pursuit of truth, for the fourth estate, and for making the point that the press, and journalism itself, is not the enemy right now but it is our best method of fighting for the American way that we hold so dear. I‚Äôm sure that the press corps would also like to thank you for the espressos as well, but I won‚Äôt venture to speak for them. \n‚ÄúPartisan media, left or right, is one thing. But when you make journalism the enemy, you make truth the enemy, and you make We The People your enemy. You do not want to pick a fight with truth.‚Äù ~ Waylon Lewis \n~", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T05:22:43.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
