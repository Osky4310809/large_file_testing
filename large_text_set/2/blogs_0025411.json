Which max out at a robust, but not interstellar-ready 29,000 mph .\nBut what if we could traverse those 235 trillion miles (40 light years) with some other technology—like something from the world of science fiction?\nThis is awesome! Send me! Be there in 800,000 years w our current propulsion technology. More work to do. Let's get on it! #TRAPPIST1 https://t.co/lCbfGkBpLY\n— Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) February 22, 2017\nLeaving aside Doctor Who’s Tardis and all other specifically time-travel based vehicles, we'll focus on propulsion-based systems. Each one of them, Star Wars , Star Trek , Interstellar , Alien , Battlestar Galactica , even the recent Passengers , have their own space travel trope. Most manage light-speed jumps in a matter of minutes. The more realistic ones put their astronauts in suspended animation, but instead of sleeping for hundreds of years, they’re usually on ice for decades.\nSEE ALSO: Seven Earth-sized planets orbit an alien star only 40 light-years away\nWe’ve looked at some of these classic science fiction films and franchises, their hero spaceships and the various guesses at just how fast any of them can travel and applied it all to our planned trip to TRAPPIST-1. Each one gets a TRAPPIST-1 Travel score on a scale of 1-to-5 (5 being the best). At the end, we’ll select the winner and start packing our bags.\nStar Wars: Millennium Falcon\nImage: Manfred Schmid/Getty Images\nWhile it’s obvious that the fastest ship in the galaxy, the Millennium Falcon, travels faster that the speed of light (186,000 miles per second), no one seems to know exactly how fast. There’s a hyperdrive scale , but it’s all relative to an unknown base speed.\nSince the Falcon can visit multiple galaxies in the span of one two-hour film where the action takes—at most—a few weeks, we can safely assume that the Falcon travels many times the speed of light when it jumps to hyperspace. With that in mind, we’re guessing the 40-light-year trip might take the Falcon a few minutes.\nTRAPPIST-1 Travel Score: 5\nStar Trek: Enterprise\nImage: Paramount TV/REX/Shutterstock\nMuch more's known about the fictional Warp drives in the Star Trek franchise. Series creator Gene Roddenberry defined warp speed as something just below the speed of light (.73 of a light year per hour).\nIf our calculations are correct, the Enterprise travels at a maximum speed of approximately 670,616,629 mph. At that rate, Captain Kirk arrives at the seven-planet cluster circling TRAPPIST-1 in roughly 350 hours, which is roughly 14 days.\nTRAPPIST-1 Travel Score: 4\nAlien: Nostromo\nImage: Stanley Bielecki Movie Collection/Getty Images\nThe Alien franchise has faster-than-light travel , but nothing's instantaneous. Ripley enters suspended animation in the time between Alien and its sequel, Aliens . This means traveling a light year might take a year. If you accept that guess (really, what choice do you have?) the trip to the TRAPPIST-1 system takes 40 years, just enough time for Ripely to grab another suspended animation nap.\nTRAPPIST-1 Travel Score: 3\nInterstellar: Endurance\nAs the name suggests, much of the space travel in this Matthew McConaughey movie is between planetary systems. Normally, that kind of travel would require some much faster than speed of light propulsion system, but Interstellar cheats with a surprise wormhole that appears in our own solar system. A wormhole bends or folds time so that you can take incredible shortcuts.\nBut: Without the benefit of another wormhole that leads directly to TRAPPIST-1, we can't exactly assume McConaughey and Anne Hathaway could ever make it to the newly discovered system.\nTRAPPIST-1 Travel Score: 1\nPassengers: Avalon\nImage: Courtesy of columbia pictures\nChris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence should’ve demanded an upgraded before boarding their spaceship/cruise-liner in the film Passengers. It only travels at half the speed of light . If they wanted to settle on, say, TRAPPIST-1d (our favorite), it would take them at least 80 years (assuming no one wakes them early again).\nTRAPPIST-1 Travel Score: 2\nBattlestar Galactica\nImage: Syfy via Getty Images\nLike Star Wars and Star Trek before it, the Battlestar Galactica series enjoyed the benefit of a hyper drive, in this instance known as an FTL Drive . However, unlike those franchises, Battlestar Galactica’s ships actual distort space to instantly jump from one location to another. This isn’t exactly wormhole travel, but it does make it near impossible to know exactly how fast a human or Cylon ship can travel.\nOn the other hand, if the Battlestar Galactica can not only travel with wormhole-like efficiency but choose exactly where it’s going, it may be the fastest TRAPPIST-1 option of all.\nTRAPPIST-1 Travel Score: 5\nThe winner? It should be a tossup between the Star Wars’ Millennium Falcon and The Battlestar Galactica, but we prefer the Falcon. After all, your pilot is Han Solo. At the very least, you know the trip would be nothing if not entertaining.\nBONUS: Relive SpaceX's incredible daytime rocket landing with this video", "external_links": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/37hnis/star_wars_what_does_5_past_light_speed_mean/", "http://galactica.wikia.com/wiki/FTL_Drive", "https://education.jsc.nasa.gov/explorers/p4.html", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cTHXVucS5KCviWvLCSBu2A-1NRg=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393229%2F5738d87e-b1bd-4820-b9b8-d71c890e3e38.jpg", "https://twitter.com/StationCDRKelly/status/834514976341639169", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/ojM8bRlZ.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fJXf-zoTPSDBTItyHERioJvcILI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393150%2Ffcb6ac3d-95bd-434c-a8f8-c2f5e99a92b9.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NORR0qXnEql3TDSBK1g9E3shTsE=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393159%2F2d7ef318-5448-4bd1-9e71-0d02e984532c.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/I94zq7UdC6fBgBIhXCAIqvT9SHs=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393162%2Fdb3755c6-a4e0-49ef-84f7-c9ead0ebf5bc.jpg", "https://t.co/lCbfGkBpLY", "http://www.foxnews.com/science/2016/12/21/film-passengers-highlights-crazy-distances-and-times-space-flight.html", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/n5tFH7JZvsO-tdv4xBbecrD6jXY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393155%2F56ffd65e-757d-4e91-b5f4-9849d947d92c.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TRAPPIST1?src=hash", "http://www.space.com/27694-interstellar-movie-spaceships-infographic.html", "http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Warp_factor", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/ojM8bRlZ.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/sgi27-XJaWh039APHTtSvAn-eRY=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393162%2Fdb3755c6-a4e0-49ef-84f7-c9ead0ebf5bc.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/d-LtKepfYThbKww_7uNYgNbv1CI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393155%2F56ffd65e-757d-4e91-b5f4-9849d947d92c.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SDSTduOLD74Sz3SAc2hiPrCAIAQ=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393150%2Ffcb6ac3d-95bd-434c-a8f8-c2f5e99a92b9.jpg", "http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/8386/is-there-ftl-travel-in-the-aliens-franchise", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ry_rKW05oHxhFimeN6nn4FxRAeM=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393229%2F5738d87e-b1bd-4820-b9b8-d71c890e3e38.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bhcKGTfOKA3gOb8b7ZY5GO55CPI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393159%2F2d7ef318-5448-4bd1-9e71-0d02e984532c.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-24T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:53:47.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
