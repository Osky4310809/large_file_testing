The family had him cremated and placed his remains in the family barn.\n\"Leslie's hobbies included being abusive to his family, expediting trips to heaven for the beloved family pets and fishing, which he was less skilled with than the previously mentioned,\" states the unconventional obituary. \"Leslie's life served no other obvious purpose, he did not contribute to society or serve his community and he possessed no redeeming qualities besides [quick-witted] sarcasm which was amusing during his sober days.\"\nThe brutally honest writer told KTRK that she has received some cruel responses for her words but said that she is \"happy for those that simply do not understand,\" as this indicates that they had a happy upbringing.\n\"I loved my father because he was my father and his passing would not have been any less difficult had he been a good father,\" the daughter explained in a statement to KTRK. \"As someone that 'hated a liar', I believe even he would have appreciated the honesty. I apologize to anyone that my father hurt and I felt it would have been offensive to portray him as anything other than who he was. This obituary was intended to help bring closure because not talking about domestic violence doesn't make it go away!\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:23:58.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
