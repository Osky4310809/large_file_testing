Recently, the pop star shared a pic of her adorable twin daughters in matching tracksuits and gold bows, and it’s beyond obvious that she couldn’t be more excited about becoming a mother again.\nEarlier this month, Madonna adopted 4-year-old twins Esther and Stella from Malawi, where she previously adopted her 11-year-old son and daughter, David Banda and Mercy James . Since then, she’s focused on getting the twins settled into their new life, which includes getting acquainted with their siblings, their home — and, of course, perfecting their Instagram poses.\n“Today’s Blessing brought to you by Adidas! ⭐️ ,” the singer captioned the post. Today's Blessing brought to you by Adidas! ⭐️ \nA post shared by Madonna (@madonna) on Feb 21, 2017 at 9:20am PST \nToo cute! We’re getting more and more obsessed with these darling little girls by the minute. We can’t help but notice that at least one of the sisters looks a little nervous in this shot, but with a fierce pop star mom, she’ll be over her camera shyness in no time.\nApparently, Madonna is already grooming Estelle and Stella for that performance life, as the pair showed off their vocal skills in this adorable rendition of “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.”\nA little night Music ,, ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ \nA post shared by Madonna (@madonna) on Feb 18, 2017 at 5:50pm PST \nWe can totally feel the passion in that performance, which is apparently something the twins have in common with their new big brother David, who is also not coy when it comes to singing his heart out.\nFriendship Goals part 2 even friends need to know when to give it a rest ⚽️ \nA post shared by Madonna (@madonna) on Oct 10, 2016 at 10:38am PDT \nLOVE IT! Is it too early to put in a request for a family jam session? Thanks in advance, Madonna!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:28:31.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
