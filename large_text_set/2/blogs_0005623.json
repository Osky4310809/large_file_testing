AP/File \nMANILA, Philippines — The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Tuesday called on the negotiators of communist rebels to surrender or risk being arrested as he rejected arguments that they were covered by an immunity guarantee. \nCol. Edgard Arevalo said in a statement that the temporary liberty granted to the negotiators of the National Democratic Front (NDF) was on account of the bail granted by courts upon the intercession of the Philippine government. \nSince President Rodrigo Duterte terminated the peace talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-NDF (CPP-NPA-NDF), this effectively signals that the negotiators should finish their activities and return to the country, Arevalo, the public affairs chief of the AFP, argued. \n\"The NDF negotiators should comply forthwith especially those who are on bail because the ground for the grant of bail has ceased to exist,\" Arevalo said. \nArevalo said that the NDF could not invoke the Joint Agreement on Security and Immunity Guarantee (JASIG) because the agreement applied only to communist members in hiding invited by the government to participate in the peace negotiations. The safe conduct pass provided by JASIG is meant to encourage these negotiators to go out. \nArevalo noted that the negotiators being invited to surrender were out of prison by virtue of bail and not by the guarantees of JASIG.   \nHe said that the courts had already taken \"judicial notice\" of the chief executive's termination of peace talks with communist rebels and failure to surrender would mean that they had jumped bail. AFP supports NPA 'terrorist' tag \nThe Armed Forces also supported the president's labeling of the NPA as a terrorist group, according to Arevalo. \nArevalo said the actions of communist guerillas such as extortion, burning and planting of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) constitute acts of terrorism. \n\"By extorting money from individuals, private businesses, and corporations; burning of buses, public conveyances, and farm implements; in driving away indigenous people from their communities; of laying of IEDs that has actually victimized non-combatants, are definitely acts of terrorism,\" the AFP public affairs chief said. \nThe NPA is on the list of foreign terrorist organizations of the US State Department. Efforts to remove it from the said list have so far failed with the State Department saying that the NPA still meets the criteria of being a terrorist group.
