Here are five things... View gallery Kompany's injury woes continue \nVincent Kompany had been expected to return from injury against Huddersfield but instead missed out... due to another injury . \nBut Kompany did not train on Friday after picking up a fresh injury and will miss City's trip to the John Smith's Stadium. \nKompany has made one appearance in 2017, playing the full 90 minutes in City's 3-0 FA Cup win at Crystal Palace three weeks ago. \nGuardiola and his medical team have used Kompany sparingly as the 30-year-old makes his way back from the latest setback of an injury-ravaged period \nThe latest set-back is not thought to be major but will be a blow to the City captain as he tries to return from yet another injury. A familiar sight for Man City fans (Photo: Reuters) Guardiola takes the FA Cup seriously \nWith the Premier League title all but gone the FA Cup is the next best chance for Pep Guardiola to win a trophy in his debut season in England. \nAnd the City manager proved that by fielding a strong team in a competition where plenty of Premier League sides have put out weakened sides. \nThe likes of Sergio Aguero, Nolito, Fernando and Fernandinho all featured at the John Smith's Stadium but still found it hard work against the Championship side. \nReinforcements in Kevin de Bruyne and Leroy Sane were chucked on in the second half to try and win it but couldn't find a breakthrough.

And it was the sort of performance that only fuels fires of a departure in the summer. Sergio Aguero had a game to forget (Photo: Getty) Guardiola continues to struggle \nIt just going Pep Guardiola's way since arriving in England. \nThe Premier League has been unforgiving and now even the FA Cup isn't going his way. \nHudderfield made it hard for City but in truth the Citizens were disappointing on the day. \nA replay beckons as Guardiola's struggles since arriving from Germany continue.
