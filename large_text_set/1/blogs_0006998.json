Earlier, comeback man Yuvraj recorded a 40-ball fifty just before Rayudu retired post his 97-ball hundred. \nOpting to bowl first, England began well with the new ball on a pitch that was offering some assistance for the pacers with a bit of grass cover. With movement in the air and off the pitch, England's discipline meant a wicket was just around the corner and David Willey got one to sneak through Mandeep Singh's defences to hit timber. The Indian opener failed to cover for inswing and was also foxed by the inward seam movement as well. \nRayudu joined Shikhar Dhawan at the crease and the duo treated the bowling on merit before shifting gears in the 16th over. Building on a 13-run over from Jake Ball, the second wicket pair attacked Liam Dawson upon his arrival and took him for 24 runs in his two overs. Both brought up their fifties with boundaries. \nDesperate for a wicket, Eoin Morgan brought back Ball and the move worked immediately as Dhawan nicked off to the wicket-keeper. Walking out to a great reception from the crowd, Yuvraj was greeted with short balls. However, the Punjab all-rounder weathered the storm and counter-attacked, taking Adil Rashid for two sixes in an over. \nThe partnership started flourishing and it crossed the 50-run mark in the 38th over. The duo also spoiled Moeen Ali's figures by scoring 13 runs off his last over and soon Yuvraj brought up his fifty with a pull shot off Woakes. \nTwo balls later, Rayudu, who managed the nervous 90s pretty well, completed his hundred. While the celebration was very mild, Rayudu looked at the dressing room to hint that he was ready to retire to allow Dhoni to have some batting practice. He was asked to carry on, only for the over to end though. \nThe crowd that came in big numbers broke into a loud roar as they saw Dhoni put his gloves on and walk out to bat. Just as fans were recollecting old memories of the Yuvraj-Dhoni partnership, Ball bounced the former out. \nSanju Samson bagged a golden duck in quest for quick runs, but a well-set Dhoni was ready to launch his assault, much to the delight of the crowd. In fact, the game was paused for a brief moment as an intruder escaped the security and fell at Dhoni's feet. If one thought England did well to concede just 23 runs in three overs before the 50th over, Dhoni proved why he was one of the best finishers the game has ever seen. \nThe first delivery from Chris Woakes was sent flat over the square leg rope - bringing up his fifty as well - before a clever-looking guide off a slower ball earned him a boundary off the next ball. Woakes banged it short for the third ball, but Dhoni managed a top-edged pull that cleared Buttler. Another top edge resulted, but it landed safely near long leg. Dhoni then powered one over the square leg fence again, before Woakes closed out what turned out to be a 23-run over with a fine yorker. \nDhoni's blitz helped India A get the extra 10 runs towards the end. A target of 305 is not all that challenging by modern day standards, but with a bit of grass cover on the pitch and the ball expected to swing under lights, England will have to be sensible in their reply. \nBrief scores: India A 304/5 (Ambati Rayudu 100 (retired out), MS Dhoni 68 not out, Shikhar Dhawan 63, Yuvraj Singh 56; David Willey 2 for 55, Jake Ball 2 for 61). © Cricbuzz TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T15:18:13.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
