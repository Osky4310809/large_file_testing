King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted a day ago 6 Bassist Johnny Christ recently discussed Mike Portnoy's A7X stint back in 2010, explaining how the drummer changed the band.Asked on the whole matter by Metal Insight , Johnny replied (via Blabbermouth ): \"Just having those moments where we can actually show our ability as players on our respective instruments - we've always kind of done it, and sometimes you go a little too long and everything like that.\"And that's great for the progressive fan, and I love that stuff - I grew up on it - but for this band, we like to make sure that every note really counts and every part is really there. So I think what he brought is a little bit more of having those ideas back. \"I mean, looking back on what we did on ' Nightmare ' with Jimmy's parts, there's some things that Mike was able to add in on 'Nightmare' with his hands and cymbal work that Jimmy hadn't really written out yet before he passed. So there was a lot of cool stuff. And it definitely inspired some ideas like that.\"Directly asked whether he misses Portnoy, the musician replied: \"I love Mike. We still see him every once in a while when we're out near his hometown and out on the road and everything. We always make sure we hook with him and say hi, and to his family and everything. \"We're still great friends. Everyone knows Mike Portnoy's reputation. He's a great drummer, and he helped us out in a great time of need. He really helped us get back underneath out feet and continue this band. Between him andâ€¦ he played an integral part, and our fans just rallied behind us, and today we're still doing it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:28:48.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
