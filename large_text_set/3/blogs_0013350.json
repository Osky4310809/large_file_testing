Israel and its supporters had exhorted Mr. Guterres to renounce the report, which they described as a baseless smear meant to isolate and delegitimize the country. Supporters of the report have expressed hope that it could add momentum to an international movement to boycott Israel, which they see as similar to the global campaign of economic pressure on South Africa that helped end apartheid in the early 1990s. The regional commission that produced the report, based in Beirut, Lebanon, comprises 18 Arab member states of the United Nations. Most do not recognize Israel. The authors included a former United Nations human rights investigator, Richard Falk, which particularly galled many Israel supporters who regard him as an anti-Semite and a discredited conspiracy theorist. \n  Many have questioned why the United Nations continues to engage with Mr. Falk. Mr. Falk said in an email Friday evening that he had been “astonished by the furor caused by the report,” and that Ms. Khalaf had been made a scapegoat. “It is an academic study that tries its best to look at the evidence and analyze the applicable law in a professional manner,” he said. “I feel that I have been smeared in this effort to discredit the report without reading it or criticizing its substance.” \nAdvertisement Ms. Khalaf said at a hastily called news conference in Beirut that Mr. Guterres had pressed her to withdraw the report, which asserts that “Israel has established an apartheid regime that dominates the Palestinian people as a whole.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
