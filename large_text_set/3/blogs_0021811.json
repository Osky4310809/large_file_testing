In April, he was sentenced to a 720-day jail term after he was caught violating his 10-year probation by appearing at a party where alcohol was served, and then fleeing to Mexico with his mother to evade authorities (he claimed being sent back to America violated his human rights ). \nNow his lawyers are trying to get him out of jail again. \nLawyers working for Couch have filed a motion claiming that the judge who sentenced him had no authority to do so, according to the Associated Press . Their argument is that the judge only had jurisdiction over criminal cases and that, because Couch’s situation involved a matter from when he was a juvenile, it should have been considered a civil case. \nWhen State District Judge Wayne Salvant sentenced Couch, he told him “you’re not getting out of jail.” He then imposed four consecutive 180-day sentences for each of the four people who were killed by Couch’s intoxicated driving in 2013.
