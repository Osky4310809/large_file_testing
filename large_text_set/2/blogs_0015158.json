You can book the Sky Sports Box Office event here... \n\"I heard that many times from David Haye and Tyson Fury. I just recently heard it at the New York press conference from Anthony, that it's all about a mental game. \n\"But I'm not playing games. I'm serious with what I'm doing. There are no mental games from me. \n\"Maybe it is something you can use in a way but it is not going to work on my skin; it is too thick. Eventually people get under their (own) skin, which happened in the case of David Haye and unfortunately for Tyson Fury. \n\"That's why I don't play these games and I am straightforward. People trying to get under my skin are concentrating on the wrong things, mind games, and are getting themselves twisted in their own mind.\" \nThe April match-up represents one between two generations of Olympians - an experienced former champion who will be 41 come the big night and a promising fighter who is almost 14 years younger. \nAsked if he expected he would still be fighting now 14 years ago, Klitschko said: \"Never. Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko - Tale of the Tape \n\"It's funny. I was driving in the car from the airport to here (a press conference in Cologne) and I realised I know these streets so well because I've been competing here and so has my brother. \n\"I fought here for the first time against Axel Shultz and I thought 'when was that?'. It already feels like a long time ago. It doesn't sound good to me. \n\"I'm glad that I'm still around, but it was 1999. At times age is only a number but at certain times, when you look back, it's obviously interesting.\" \nWatch Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium on April 29, live on Sky Sports Box Office Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:42:42.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
