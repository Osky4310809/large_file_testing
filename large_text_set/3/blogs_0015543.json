Gunn revealed today on The Adam Corolla Show that Michael Rosenbaum has a mystery role in the sequel and that his character is in some way connected to the mystery role that Sylvester Stallone has long said to be playing. \nRELATED: James Gunn and Greg McLean on The Belko Experiment \n“We do have a couple of characters who are very important to the Marvel Universe who are going to make their debut in ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2’ which people don’t know about,” Gunn says (via CBM ) to promote his new film, The Belko Experiment . “Sylvester Stallone plays one of these characters…my friend Michael Rosenbaum also has a pretty decent movie in the role as well and it sort of works in tandem with Sly’s character.” \nMichael Rosenbaum is primarily known to comic book fans for his work with the Distinguished Competition . He played Lex Luthor on The CW’s hit series Smallville and has voiced The Flash in various Justice League animated projects. Of course, James Gunn fans may know Michael Rosenbaum best for playing Peanuts ‘ Charlie Brown in two episodes of Gunn’s old webseries, PG Porn . You can check out Rosenbaum’s first appearance as the blockhead in the player at the bottom of this page. While PG Porn does not contain any nudity, it does feature quite a bit of gore and viewer discretion is advised. \nA Walt Disney Pictures and Marvel Studios production, the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 cast includes the return of Chris Pratt ( Jurassic World , Parks and Recreation ) as Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana ( Avatar , Star Trek ) as Gamora, Dave Bautista ( SPECTRE ) as Drax, Vin Diesel ( xXx , Furious 7 ) as the voice of Groot, Bradley Cooper ( Joy , American Sniper ) as the voice of Rocket, Michael Rooker ( Slither , Jumper ) as Yondu, Karen Gillan ( Doctor Who , The Big Short ) as Nebula, and Sean Gunn ( Guardians of the Galaxy , Gilmore Girls ) as Kraglin. New cast members include Pom Klementieff ( Oldboy ), who plays Mantis, Elizabeth Debicki ( The Great Gatsby , Everest ), Chris Sullivan ( The Knick , The Drop ) and Kurt Russell ( The Hateful Eight , Furious 7 ) as Ego, the Living Planet. \nSet to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape #2, the Guardians of the Galaxy sequel continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos. The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill’s true parentage. Old foes become new allies and fan-favorite characters from the classic comics will come to our heroes’ aid as the Marvel cinematic universe continues to expand. \nDirected and written by James Gunn, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is produced by Marvel Studios’ president, Kevin Feige , with Louis D’Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Jonathan Schwartz, Nik Korda and Stan Lee serving as executive producers.
