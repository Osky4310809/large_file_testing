Round 1 The time for waiting was finally over (Photo: Getty) \nFinally after months of being kept out of arm's reach, they were unleashed on each other. The fans were expecting a tear-up after all the trash talking - and they were not disappointed. Bellew rocked Haye with a left hook, knocking the former WBA heavyweight champ on to the ropes. Haye was swinging and missing and he looked like a fighter who has only had fewer than seven minutes of action since July 2012. Round 1: Bellew 10-9 Round 2 Haye started strongly   was occupying the centre of the ring as Bellew tried to keep out of range. Haye was supposed to the quicker and slicker fighter, but Bellew was moving better. He countered well when Haye missed at the end of the second and might have just shaded the second as well, 10-9. Round 3 Haye edged round three  's strategy was working well so far. He was moving well and Haye's timing was off. There wasn't much action and some of the crowd grew restless in the third and they wanted more blood and thunder. Haye looked like he might have hit Bellew with a punch after the bell and he might have nicked that round because he was the busier fighter. 10-9 Haye Round 4 Haye's good start continued (Photo: Getty) \nBoth fighters appeared wary of each other, although Haye brought his fans to their feet when he landed in the fourth. Bellew smiled back at him as he back-pedalled, to show he wasn't hurt. That round was also Haye's and he is looking better. Round 5 Haye got Bellew at the start of round five   caught Bellew at the beginning of the fifth, only for the Scouser to counter well. Bellew was much more competitive than many had thought he would be. But Haye was beginning to find his range and move his feet. He caught Bellew with a nice combination and before getting out of trouble. I gave that round to Haye again and have him in front by a round. Round 6 Haye went down in the sixth (Photo: REUTERS) \nBoth fighters slipped at the start to spark a proper tear-up between them. Suddenly Haye's tank looked empty and he fell to the canvas. He managed to beat the count before the bell saved him at the end of the round. Bellew has really hurt Haye and it does not look like he can last much longer. Round 7 Bellew looked to take advantage   pinned Haye in his corner in the eighth as he landed blow after blow. Somehow, Haye managed to stay upright, although he looked dead on his feet. Bellew also looked tired and the exertion of pulverising Haye was taking its toll. Haye was hanging on for dear life by the end of the seventh and staggered across the ring to his corner. Bellew 10-9 Round 8 \nSomehow Bellew was still standing by the eighth. He tried to land his trademark big right to flatten Bellew, knowing it was his only chance now of victory. Both fighters were swinging and missing and the energy used up in the previous rounds had drained them. It was now Bellew's fight to lose and Haye beckoned him forward. Round 9 Haye's injury   complained to his corner that he went over on his ankle in the sixth to slip just before Bellew's onslaught. Certainly, his movement seemed hindered as he tried to claw his way back into the fight. Haye was still punching and knocked Bellew back onto the ropes with a big right. Haye then caught Bellew with a low blow and was ordered to a neutral corner by referee Phil Edwards. Haye 10-9 Round 10 \nHaye came out for round 10 with tape around his hurt right ankle. Edwards was not happy and ordered his corner to wrap the bandage properly. Edwards then warned Bellew for hitting Haye with a low blow as the Scouser evened up the score. Haye was virtually fighting on one leg now and Bellew was warned again. Bellew offered his glove as an apology, but Haye tried to punch him and missed theatrically, almost falling over. Bellew 10-9 Round 11 It's all over   just has to stay on his feet to win and Haye is hobbling about the ring. Haye had to take the fight to Bellew, which was proving almost impossible on one leg. He lunged at Bellew and fell over again. It was embarrassing for the two-weight world champ. Bellew soon put him out of his misery, knocking him through the ropes. Haye just about managed to climb back through them in time, only for his corner to throw in the towel and referee Edwards waved it off. Bellew, star of Creed, had written his own Rocky ending by stopping his bitter rival against all the odds.
