Like Electronic Arts has done for games in the past, folks on Xbox One will be able to play the highly-anticipated sci-fi RPG five days before its retail release on March 21st. Sound familiar? That's because EA did the same thing for the most recent entry developer BioWare's other role-playing series, Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. The news comes by way of a tweet from Xbox's Larry \"Major Nelson\" Hryb. Xbox One is the only console where Access is available, but PC owners have the same deal with Origin Access according to Game Informer .\nThe big question is, if you have Access will you have enough time to power through Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild before starting Andromeda on March 17th? Great news for @EAAccess members: You will have access to a 10-hour trial of Mass Effect: Andromeda on March 16 (five days before launch) pic.twitter.com/kKqBpC7V4v\n‚Äî üéÆ Larry Hryb üéôÔ∏è (@majornelson) January 23, 2017", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EAAccess", "http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/01/23/psa-ea-access-members-can-play-10-hours-of-mass-effect-andromeda-early.aspx", "https://twitter.com/majornelson/status/823614562033221632"], "published": "2017-01-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T09:33:42.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
