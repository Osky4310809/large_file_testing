Sushi Plus Rotary Sushi Bar is coming to this Lakeview spot. Ashok Selvam Another rotary sushi restaurant is coming to Chicago, but with a twist. Sushi Plus Rotary Sushi Bar in Lakeview will serve customers using robotic sushi trains. Instead of just waiting for an item to pass by in the rotary, diners order—likely off a touchscreen—and items will arrive table side via a conveyor belt. The dining experience is faster than the typical rotary belt sushi system. Sushi Plus has a suburban location in Aurora, and they use traditional rotary conveyor belts, according to DNAinfo , which first broke the news of the upcoming Lakeview restaurant at 3219 N. Broadway St. The sushi spot is replacing a Five Guys that closed five months ago. In the suburbs, Sushi Plus’ menu is more than maki. They offer dumplings, yakitori, poke bowls, and sushi pizza. The sushi pizzas will find harmony in joining the sushi burritos that have already popped up across town. Perhaps some of those items will make it to Lakeview. However, the city may not be complete until sushi doughnuts arrive. Rotary sushi is a rarity in Chicago. Though other restaurant have opened and closed, the only one operating within the city limits appears to be Wabi Sabi in Uptown. 3219 N.
