They tell the important stories of the citizens who helped launch the civil rights movement in Birmingham and the Freedom Riders whose bravery raised national awareness of segregation and violence. These stories are part of our shared history.\nThe three monuments in the South pay tribute to our nation’s bloody struggle for civil rights. NPR reports that a section of downtown Birmingham, Alabama includes the 16 th Street Baptist Church where four black girls were killed in 1963 in a bombing by the Ku Klux Klan; that church will be the center of a newly-established Birmingham Civil Rights National Historical Park. In Anniston, Alabama, the Freedom Riders National Monument includes the Greyhound station were a bus of interracial activists was attacked in 1961. Obama also designated the Reconstruction Era National Monument in Beaufort County, South Carolina, to pay tribute to a community of freed slaves that lived there during Reconstruction.\nEstablishing a national monument that illuminates the Reconstruction era is especially poignant. As historian Eric Foner told the New York Times, “ “This was a pivotal moment in history that really changed the Constitution, and changed the definition of American citizenship, which, in parentheses, is really under attack right now.It really began the process of making African-Americans equal members of American society.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T07:07:01.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
