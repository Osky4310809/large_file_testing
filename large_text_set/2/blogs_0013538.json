Swain wants to go back to a time when you couldn’t visit your partner in the hospital because someone might accidentally inconvenience her mind for all of half a second. \nAnd she absolutely does care, since she obviously spends time thinking about this. She should also realize that the only people who would give a damn if two people are gay just because they’re hanging out together are other anti-gay bigots like herself. \nThen again, whenever a Catholic priest pops up in a news story, part of me wonders if he’s guilty of pedophilia, even though only a small fraction of priests have ever done anything like that. \nBy Swain’s logic, I guess we should shut down the Vatican!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:33:03.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
