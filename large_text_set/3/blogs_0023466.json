Children’s Medical Mission West had raised funds for Dominique’s flight. Baby Dominique and Nancy Swabb Advocate Children's Hospital \n“If you can say love at first sight, I think that’s true for us,” Swabb said at the hospital’s press conference on Tuesday. “When we met sweet Dominique she came on three flights to get here. She came with an escort from American Airlines and we thought about her family far, far away trusting us, trusting the doctors they had never met, trusting the escort who flew her half way across the world.” \nIt was an instant bond. \n“She was so sweet and so ready to accept love and be affectionate and show affection,” she says. “We knew that she was loved. We thought every day, every moment about her family waiting for her return, and we just feel really honored to be her family for a little while.” \nThe March 8 surgery, which was performed by five surgeons and involved a team of over 50 clinicians, was necessary to give Dominique the chance to live a long and normal life. Without it, her heart and lungs would continue functioning for two people and shorten her lifespan, according to the hospital.

Now that we have removed her parasitic twin, she is a more normal girl,” Dr. Robert Givens Kellogg, a pediatric neurosurgeon, said at the press conference. \nDominique will soon be reunited with her family in Africa.
