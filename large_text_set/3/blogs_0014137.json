However, multiple sources say the rumours were connected to the campaign of Maxime Bernier, thought by many to be O’Leary’s chief rival for the leadership.\nOn Friday, Bernier lashed out at his rival. “Kevin O’Leary is a loser,” he said in a statement. “I’m a winner … He’s a bad candidate. Instead of trying to win people over by putting out a platform, he’s throwing mud to try to save his campaign.”\nFormer cabinet minister Tony Clement, a Bernier surrogate, said the campaign is “highly confident” that everyone involved is adhering to party rules.\n“It’s not unusual for losing campaigns to have people on the ground, who are not going to meet their targets, complain about the other guys,” he said.\nRelated Maxime Bernier calls Kevin O’Leary a ‘loser’ for suggesting ‘widespread vote rigging’ in Tory leadership race John Ivison: Maxime Bernier says Conservative leadership race is down to himself and Kevin O’Leary The complaints, however, were not limited to the O’Leary camp. At least two other campaigns brought concerns about illegal bulk membership sales to Conservative headquarters this week.\nAndrew Scheer’s campaign manager Hamish Marshall said he communicated with the party on Monday and Tuesday about rumours he had been hearing.\n“We just got calls from people who were helping volunteering with our campaign saying people they knew were being signed up without their awareness. And so we brought it to the attention of the party, we brought them some names and said, ‘You should look into it,’” he said.\nChris Alexander, another former cabinet minister, said his campaign had unearthed “detailed evidence of incorrect, I would even say illegal practice,” in about 10 ridings in the GTA and Ottawa, which he brought to the party’s attention early afternoon on Wednesday.\nIn addition to hearing about people being signed up as party members without their knowledge, Alexander said he became aware of software being used that masked IP addresses, allowing multiple members to be signed up from the same computer. He wouldn’t say to which campaign the allegations were tied.\nOn Friday afternoon, Conservative Party announced that “an expedited review” had found that 1,351 such memberships had been registered illicitly and would be tossed from the rolls.\nThe disqualified memberships had all been purchased anonymously using one of two IP addresses through the Conservative Party website party, spokesman Cory Hann said in a statement. The memberships were not linked to any one campaign, and all were purchased with pre-paid credit cards.\n“Our rules are clear, memberships must be purchased by an individual out of their own personal funds and we’ll continue to strictly enforce that rule,” Hann said.\nThe allegations, which have been not been proven, are said to centre on organizers in the Tamil and Sikh communities in the Greater Toronto Area.\nA source familiar with the leadership race described a process whereby organizers would offer pre-paid cards to members of the community, tell them to sign up using the card, and obtain a photocopy of their identification at the same time.\nThe plan, according to the source, was to visit the people again when they’d received their mail-in ballots, collect them and fill them out centrally, attaching the photocopied IDs that are required to verify a voter’s identity.\nAsked for details about the allegations he had received, Alexander described a similar process.\nInstead of trying to win people over by putting out a platform, he’s throwing mud to try to save his campaign.\nMike Coates, a senior strategist on O’Leary’s team, acknowledged his campaign wasn’t the only one with knowledge of the allegations. “We’re not the only ones. We’re the only ones with the balls to go public,” he said. “This stuff’s gotta be stamped out.”\nOthers, however, including Alexander, berated O’Leary for going public.\nThe Conservative Party tightened its membership rules ahead of this leadership race. In the past, candidates were able to sign up members in bulk, using cash. Now, would-be members must register individually, usisng a personal cheque or credit card for the $15 fee.\nThe move was seen by party insiders as a way to limit organizers’ ability to leverage ethnic communities in the ways being alleged this week.\nThe deadline for candidates to sign up new members is March 28. Ranked ballots will be sent to party members starting in late April. They can be mailed in or brought to voting stations on election day, May 27. The party’s new leader will be announced at a convention in Toronto that evening.\n• Email: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: mariedanielles \n• Email: rwarnica@nationalpost.com | Twitter: richardwarnica \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:46:26.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
