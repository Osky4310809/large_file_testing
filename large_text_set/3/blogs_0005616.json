Even though he drove back up to ninth by the end of the race, it was a costly, almost incomprehensible error. \nHe said so himself afterward. \n“I just made a mistake that I preach all the time that you don’t need to make. And then you go go out and make it yourself instead of following all the things you preach,” Harvick said. “That part of it is hard for me to swallow.” \nAs difficult as that was for Harvick, he perhaps could take some solace in the fact that he was far from alone in getting caught speeding on pit road Sunday. \nThere were at least 10 such infractions throughout the 325-lap, 500-mile affair, with such veteran drivers as seven-time Cup champion Jimmie Johnson and Matt Kenseth, another former Cup champ, both getting dinged twice. \n“We just sped on pit road there some,” said Kenseth, who rallied to finish third. “All our lights were right, so I don’t know. We must have (had) something happen there and that got us behind. \n“Then we were trying to get caught up and it happened again, so we just had to forget about our indications, just go real slow down pit road and finally came back from it all.” \nOthers who were caught going too fast on pit road in the race included Joey Logano, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Chase Elliott. That left Johnson thinking that perhaps something was off with the way all the Hendrick Motorsports teams were figuring their pit-road speeds, since Earnhardt and Elliott are HMS teammates. \n“It was a tough day with two speeding penalties,” said Johnson, who had won the previous two races at the 1.5-mile track but finished 19th, one lap down, on Sunday. “We will have to look at our math and figure out what was going on there. \n“The first one, I’m sure I could have gotten popped. The second one I made sure I didn’t get popped again and I still got in trouble. So we might have had something off on our end.” \nThere also were some new pit-road speeding monitors added to the Atlanta track in the off-season, and that may have had something to do with it. \n“We got caught speeding on pit road as I guess a lot of people did,” Earnhardt said. “So we got to look at that and see what we have wrong. I was on my lights perfectly, but seems like a lot of guys got popped in the same segment.” \nAll of them were costly, but none more so than Harvick’s final one. \n“Man, one way or another I have figured out how to lose races here at Atlanta after being so dominant,” said Harvick, who led 292 of the first 311 laps before suffering the penalty that cost him the race. It was the fifth time in the last six races at Atlanta that Harvick has led the most laps, only to see someone else stand triumphant in Victory Lane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T16:57:14.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
