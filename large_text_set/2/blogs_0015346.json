Proud mother and newly-converted risk taker, Kareena Kapoor, emerged in head-to-toe olive, featuring a trench coat and yogini-style wrap pants, both from Chola. \nA matching tank top was worn underneath to deliver flawlessly on this monotone look. For accessories, stylist Mohit Rai picked a choker from Eina Ahluawalia’s recent collection, Battlecry (shop the collection, here ). \nSoftly tousled hair, textured pointed pumps, and heavily kohled eyes in place, Bebo looked oh-so-appropriately-ready for the screening of husband, Saif Ali Khan’s movie, Rangoon . In case you’ve been on the lookout for dressed-up earthy, this look should help you rise to the occasion.
