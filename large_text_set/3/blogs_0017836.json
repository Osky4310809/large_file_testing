The 10 locations are: Appleby in Cumbria, Coventry, Elsecar in South Yorkshire, Hull's Old Town, King's Lynn, Nottingham, Ramsgate, Sunderland, Sutton in South London, and Weston-super-Mare. \nHistoric England said it would work with each local authority. \nNeglected listed buildings, it said, will be restored and brought back into use as housing, retail or community spaces. \nConservation areas will also be improved to kick-start regeneration, and historic sites will be developed as visitor attractions, Historic England said. \nHeritage Action Zones featured in last year's Culture White Paper with an aim to build tourism, reinvigorate local areas and grow local economies. \nCarol Pyrah, of Historic England, said the investment had already \"unlocked partnership funding\" from elsewhere. \n\"It's about tourism but also tackling the need for housing and making places more attractive for people to live in and businesses to invest in,\" Ms Pyrah said. \nLocal authorities applied for Heritage Action Zone status, and Historic England plans to award it to more places over the next two years. \nTracey Crouch, Heritage Minister, said: \"Our heritage and historic buildings are beautiful assets that make our towns and cities unique. \n\"They tell the story of a town's past and should be protected and cherished.\" \nSally Balcombe, VisitEngland chief executive, said the investment would \"spread economic growth through tourism across England\". Elsecar, South Yorkshire Image copyright Historic England \nElsecar is already the location of a heritage centre but Historic England said the funding would \"unlock the village's industrial past with its ironworks and collieries, but also the story of the village, its community and links to the Fitzwilliam family\". \nHistoric buildings will be brought back into use and suitable sites for new housing will be identified, and local people will be encouraged to get involved in the village's development.

Heritage trails will also be created. \nAppleby's Mayor, John Pape, said overall investment over five years was expected to be about £1.65m. \nHe said: \"We are over-the-moon that Appleby has been chosen. The heritage of the town is key to attracting tourism and is a vital factor in supporting the local economy.\" Image copyright Historic England  -owned Moot Hall on Boroughgate in Appleby is one of the projects included, after a recent survey revealed it needs substantial repairs caused by damp Weston-super-Mare Image copyright Historic England Image caption Marine Lake in Weston-super-Mare, 1925-35. The funding will support ongoing regeneration in Weston-super-Mare - and using existing buildings for quality housing \nWeston-super-Mare town centre has many Victorian, inter-war and post-war buildings. \nHistoric England's plans include using existing buildings for quality housing, enhancing heritage trails from the town to the beach and station, and opening up new pedestrian access to Weston Museum, the town square and the seafront. Coventry Image copyright Geograph/Ian Rob Image caption Coventry city centre could potentially be registered, making it one of only a handful post-war conservation areas in the country \nCarol Pyrah, of Historic England, said: \"There are loads of locations where heritage is overlooked - Coventry's 20th Century heritage is a really good example\". \nThe funding will help improve issues surrounding education, jobs, health and housing in Coventry, the organisation said, and grants will be given to improve historic buildings and shop fronts in Lady Herbert's Garden and the Burges conservation area, with a view to removing it from the Heritage at Risk Register.
