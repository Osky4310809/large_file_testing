Famous-Barr \nFebruary 28, 2005--Still in wonderment over the weekend's announcement of the acquistion of the May Department Stores Company by Federated Department Stores Inc. many customers and employees alike worry that the downtown Famous-Barr which is located in the Railway Exchange Building along with May Co. corporate offices could be closed. This is Olive St at 7th St. PHOTO BY KEVIN MANNING \nWith new owners and a plan to adapt the century-old office building, the giant Railway Exchange Building in the middle of downtown may be empty for only a couple more years. \nThe new owners of the Railway Exchange, built in 1914, plan to fill about half of the 1.2 million-square-foot building with apartments and build out the rest with a combination of office space, common areas and ground-floor retail. \nJoining Hudson Holdings, which purchased the 21-story building at the end of January, is Amos Harris , the local developer involved with the MX District (Mercantile Exchange), the Laurel apartments and the National Blues Museum just to the north on Washington Avenue. \nHarris, who described himself as a “local partner,” said the plan was to build out an estimated 600 or so apartments in the structure, some luxury and others with lower rents. Construction could start by the third quarter of next year. \n“We’re going to try and do a mix to meet the market demand,” he said. \nHarris was in St. Louis Thursday with Andrew “Avi” Greenbaum, a founder and principal of Hudson Holdings of Delray Beach, Fla. \n“Hudson is very excited to add such a monumental asset to our portfolio,” Greenbaum said in a statement. “We are looking forward to working closely with the city of St. Louis on this historic adaptive re-use project.” \nBeyond apartments, figuring out what to do with the other half of the space is still a work in progress. There might be 100,000 square feet or so of office space, although Harris said that at this point the amount was still a guess. A health club, pool and maybe even a day care center might also be part of the amenity mix. \n“That’s one of the options, but there’s a ton of options out there,” Harris said. \nNew York-based MLK Real Estate Capital arranged the $20 million in financing for Hudson Holdings to purchase the building. It was a “challenging transaction” to finance the purchase of such a large building that isn’t producing any income, MLK managing principal Solomon Kinraich said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:03:32.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
