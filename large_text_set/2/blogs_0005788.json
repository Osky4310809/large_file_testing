At one to two videos a week, usually reacting to what Trump said a day or two before the piece airs, many pieces of the videos are outdated by the time they even air . That doesn’t meant they’re not funny, or not relevant (for example in this case, Trump’s anger problems are never going away and neither is Vladimir Putin), only that the specific events the segments reference have been replaced as the best example of one particular issue with something new and newsworthy by the time they actually air. \nIt’s tough to keep up when Trump is showing off his flaws on a daily basis in the most newsworthy of ways.\n\nIn the latest “A Closer Look,” Trump’s reaction last week to the Muslim ban that is definitely not a ban is analyzed , as well as Trump golfing in the first weeks of his presidency even though he attacked Obama for many years for golfing on actual vacations or when, you know, an incredible backlash to a presidential Executive Order he just signed was still at its peak. Of course, there were references to Kellyanne Conway’s fake “Bowling Green Massacre” incident and how super fake it was both when she made the claim itself and then followed up with the assertion that she made an honest mistake. Seth deserves props for pointing out that in addition to the false Bowling Green attack, Conway also lied about an Iraqi refugee ban during the Obama administration. \nIf Late Night with Seth Meyers wants to keep up with the latest breaking stories it will be more important for them to continue focusing on pieces of the ever-evolving news cycle that other shows and outlets don’t have the time or manpower to include in their reports. Videos a few times a week can’t possibly be the most topical clips out there, but with a team as smart as Seth’s they can still be very informative and valuable to their audience.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:02:55.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
