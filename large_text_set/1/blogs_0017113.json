The WWE wrestler/burgeoning movie star/ Men’s Health cover guy was once a scrawny 12-year-old kid who was shoved into lockers, and now he has monster biceps and a 664-pound deadlift . So Cena is living proof that you, too, can build the body you want—and finish your opponents with a stepover toehold facelock move—with a steady dose of hard work and commitment. \nThat’s why he took to TODAY on Tuesday to teach simple strength moves and stretches to smiling talk-show hosts, guests, and viewers at home who didn’t have to be at work until after 10 a.m. Cena ran through basic moves like the lunge, dead bug, and glute bridge before moving onto the squat, which he called “the most important exercise to build that booty.” ( We won’t argue .) To demonstrate the weighted squat, Cena recruited Al Roker, who was waiting in the wings—Al Roker is always waiting in the wings—and hoisted the jolly weatherman on his back.
