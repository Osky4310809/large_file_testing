While we still don’t have the details on when exactly this elusive line of footwear will be released, we’ve been waiting in anticipation since Kat Von D announced her vegan shoe line during the beginning of December.\nWhat we know for sure, at this point, is that Kat Von D has refined and specific tastes when it comes to vegan and cruelty-free fashion , and her penchant for bold and vintage-inspired looks will likely inform the designs for her personal line.\nOf course, now that the designs are in the question stands: how long will we be forced to wait? Finally turned in all the content for my #vegan shoe line I plan on launching this year! Now maybe my office can go from looking like a serial [shoe] killer's place back to normal. For now. [been listening to \"Mind Idea\" by Jeremy Enigk on repeat for the past week, so figured it would be good to add it to this vid] \nA video posted by Kat Von D (@thekatvond) on Jan 18, 2017 at 11:28pm PST \nOur girl, hard at work.\nKat Von D / www.instagram.com Hopefully, this will be a spring release. Especially considering how well those sketches would pair with spring dresses.\nKat Von D / www.instagram.com At a glance, her sketches give us ample hope for chunky heels with all manner of straps. Final sketches of shoes I'm designing for my #vegan shoe line are due tomorrow!! Been drawing all day non-stop! But I HAD to take a cuddle-party break with this cute little fucker. #piaf #distraction #cuddleslut #thedrawingboard #whenyoureyeshadowmatchesyourcat #casavond \nA photo posted by Kat Von D (@thekatvond) on Dec 8, 2016 at 6:23pm PST \nSo many options.\nKat Von D / www.instagram.com Look at that sketch? We can totally see ourselves wearing these for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!\nKat Von D / www.instagram.com Perhaps some of the designs will be informed by the styles found in her spacious shoe closet. Now that the drawings are in, we’re counting on a release sooner than later!
