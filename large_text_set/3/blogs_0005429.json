Hit 100 unique brews and receive a take-home mug and T-shirt; your 2,000th beer means a $100 gift card to Mahaffey’s. \nBarker’s first beer as a member, a 120 Minute India Pale Ale from Delaware’s Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, completely changed her perspective, she said. From then on, she was a hophead. \n“That was sort of like, ‘Pow!’” Barker said of the hop-heavy imperial IPA’s punch. Now, for the former light-beer devotee, she likes beers “the hoppier, the better.” \nIPAs are her favorite style, and she’s a fan of local brewers like Dundalk’s Key Brewing Co. and Union Craft Brewing in Hampden. Barker likes Colorado’s New Belgium Brewing, particularly their Fat Tire Amber Ale, too. \nIt turns out she likes most of the new beers she tries, and has only come across a couple of pints she couldn’t finish. (A tip: Don’t send any peanut butter-chocolate stouts Barker’s way.) Jo Barker at Mahaffey's Pub Algerina Perna / Baltimore Sun \nJoanne Barker sits in her personalized chair at Mahaffey's Pub. Her name is next to John Jung's, her late friend that convinced her to try craft beer for the first time. \nJoanne Barker sits in her personalized chair at Mahaffey's Pub.

(Algerina Perna / Baltimore Sun) \nWhen Jung died in 2009, Barker imagined stopping her beer tally where he did — 1,011. Ultimately, though, she decided to honor her friend through persistence. \n“I thought, ‘No, I’m not stopping. He’d be proud of me,’” she said. \nSo she pressed on without a set goal in mind. Averaging two to three new pints each visit eventually led Barker to February’s accomplishment of 5,000 beer milestone. To commemorate the accomplishment, Mahaffey’s managers Dennis and Alice Kistner ordered a Union Craft Brewing special edition firkin of Duckpin Pale Ale. The brewery added an appropriate kick to the brew. \n“They pumped it full of hops, basically,” said Dennis Kistner. “It was delicious.” \nYou can find Barker on her usual stool on the first floor of Mahaffey’s “pretty much every day,” she said with a laugh. (But no, that’s not an exaggeration.) \nAfter her shift as a medical secretary in the city, Barker typically stops by Mahaffey’s on her way to her Canton home, where she’s lived for more than three decades. (She just celebrated her 35th anniversary with her husband, who finds Mahaffey’s too crowded and only drinks Coors Light, Barker said.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:22:39.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
