The room spins. Sunshine hurts. The ticking of the clock is deafening as the daylight hours waste away under the cruel authority of your hangover. \nNever fear. Something can help you. There is medicine for this affliction, and it is comprised of eggs, potatoes, meat, and cheese. You can find these four comrades in an endless variety of combinations: breakfast burritos, all-American slams. But we should all take a cue from the Canadians and make some damn breakfast poutine. \nAfter all, they gave us Neil Young, the Caesar , and Degrassi: The Next Generation . They can be trusted. \nAs you probably already know, poutine is a fantastic edible invention of a pile of French fries loaded with cheese and gravy. If a hangover could talk, it would say, “for Christ’s sake, feed me some poutine and I’ll go away.” \nThis version comes from Callie Speer at Austin eatery Swift’s Attic . It starts with slow-cooked goat cooked with stewed vegetables—tomatoes, Castlevetrano olives, leeks, and carrots—and then is doused with a bacon-fat red-eye gravy, and topped with shredded cheese and an egg. If this won’t rescue you from the pain of your tequila overindulgence, nothing will. MAKE IT: Breakfast Poutine \nIt’s a little fancy, but you might just have to use that resourcefulness that comes with physical misery to MacGyver together whatever version you can render with the items available to you. \nAlthough, you know, a Caesar might help too . Hair of the dog, as they say. Oh, Canada!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T17:55:00.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
