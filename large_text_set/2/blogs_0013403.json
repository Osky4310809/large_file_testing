Todd Grimshaw told his partner Billy Mayhew that Adam Barlow had been looking for his father - who has been dead for 11 years \nOne wrote: \"Todd says Adam is 'looking for his Dad' in the Rovers...he'd have a job finding Mike Baldwin now... #Corrie @itvcorrie.\" \nAnother then posted: \"Did Todd just say Adam was looking for his dad?! He'll be looking a long time, his dad is Mike Baldwin and he's been dead years #Corrie.\" \nShortly afterwards, a different viewer commented: \"@itvcorrie Todd just said Adam was looking for his Dad in the Rovers?? Isn't Mike Baldwin his Dad?? Have a shock if he found him eh!!!!\" \nMoments later, another tweeted: \"@itvcorrie why did Todd say to Billy that Adam was looking for his dad? His dad is dead!\" Adam's grandfather is Ken Barlow (Photo: ITV) Mike Baldwin is Adam's real father \nA likely explanation for the blunder is that Todd was supposed to say Adam was looking for his granddad, Ken Barlow. \nBut if he was genuinely searching for his deceased father, he's in for a big surprise! \n*Coronation Street returns to ITV tomorrow at 8.30pm Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:39:43.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
