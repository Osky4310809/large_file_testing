And encouraging people to check laptops, and other such items, into the luggage hold simply makes the challenge even harder.” UK to follow Trump's US ban on laptops for flights from Middle East \nThe Government’s announcement was the latest twist in an extraordinary series of events that began on Monday evening with a now-deleted tweet from Royal Jordanian Airlines. The carrier warned passengers of a ban on electronic devices as cabin baggage. \nOn Tuesday, the US Department for Homeland Security confirmed a ban on devices bigger than a mobile phone on flights from 10 Middle Eastern and North African airports. \nOfficials cited as evidence for this move a bomb attack on a domestic flight in Somalia last year, which killed only the terrorist. \nBut as Mr Baum pointed out: \"The laptop used to bomb the Daallo Airlines flight from Mogadishu to Djibouti was handed to the passenger after the security checkpoint.” \nIt is not clear why the UK has not applied the measure to the UAE and Morocco, which were included in the US ban. The Royal Jordanian airline has banned electronic devices on flights to the US ( Björn Strey / Wikimedia ) \nAirlines and airports are coming to terms with the implications of the ban, which spell serious disruption for an estimated 5,000 passengers a day. \nA significant proportion are travellers who are flying in transit via Istanbul airport on Turkish Airlines from Asia and Africa, heading for Heathrow, Gatwick, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh. \nWhile the ban applies only from Istanbul, in practice passengers will not be able to keep their devices with them for the first leg of the journey from, say, Hong Kong or Cape Town to the Turkish transit point. They will be obliged to check them in at the airport on departure. Donald Trump's in-flight electronics ban explained \nThe scope for petty criminals to rummage through baggage in search of expensive tablets, laptops or camera is considerable. \nAll the flights covered by the US are, by definition, long haul, and the vast majority of passengers on such services will check in baggage. But on low-cost links from Turkey and Egypt to the UK, many travellers choose a hand-baggage only option — to save money or time, or both. But they will now be obliged to procure a case that will provide suitable protection for their electronic devices, and check it in. It is not clear whether the airline or passenger will cover the cost. \nThe additional items being checked in will, in turn, put extra pressure on baggage systems at both the departure and arrival airports. \nThe Government spokesperson said: “The additional security measures may cause some disruption for passengers and flights, and we understand the frustration that will cause, but our top priority will always be to maintain the safety of British nationals.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:19:59.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
