Now, a latest report from Factory Daily suggests, the homegrown e-tailer is set to acquire eBay as part of its fresh funding round of around USD 2 billion. The report adds that the round will stay open until it reaches $2 billion in total. \nCiting two source familiar with the deal, the report said, eBay’s India unit will get merged into Flipkart. Flipkart secured its latest funding at a valuation of around $10 billion, which is below the $15.5 billion valuation, the company saw in 2015. The latest round of funding included investors from eBay, Tencent and Microsoft. eBay India head Latif Nathani, had quit the company earlier this month. To create a leaner structure, eBay laid off about 100 employees at its technology centre in Bengaluru last November. \nFlipkart has been struggling to raise funds for the past few months and the latest round will help the company sustain the tough competition from Amazon.in. Moreover, the report also added that Flipkart’s negotiations with US retail giant Walmart to raise funds had not closed and that the US company can likely invest in the ecommerce in the medium term. \nSource Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).
