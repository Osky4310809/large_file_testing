Traffic will be allowed in both directions during construction but there will be temporary traffic lights, and buses and cars may have to share the same lane at times. \nWhen the work is completed, the speed on the bridge will be cut to 20mph and the central white line will be removed in a bid to make drivers proceed more cautiously. \nWestminster Bridge is set to undergo major works (AFP/Getty Images) \nThe cycle lanes will link directly into the East-West cycle superhighway, where cyclists form more than half of the traffic at peak times. Segregated lanes already exist on Blackfriars, Southwark and Vauxhall bridges. \nTfL said that “lessons have been learned” from previous schemes, with the construction period shorter and the temporary traffic lights being linked to its traffic control centre to minimise delays. \nWill Norman, London’s walking and cycling commissioner, said: “These improvements are going to make a real difference in the area, ensuring the iconic bridge is safer and more pleasant to use. We are determined to make physical activity a bigger part of Londoners’ everyday lives for the good of everyone in our city, and this is exactly the type of scheme that will help to encourage this.” \nPopular bus route: Westminster Bridge (Jeremy Selwyn) \nLeon Daniels, managing director of surface transport at TfL, said: “We have planned the work to minimise disruption, but there will be some impact. We thank road users for bearing with us while work takes place and are asking them to plan and leave more time for journeys in the area, and if possible, use alternative routes.” \nSir Hugh Taylor, chairman of Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS trust, said: “This does not mean that our concerns about the siting of the bus stop bypass have been fully allayed.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T12:47:39.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
