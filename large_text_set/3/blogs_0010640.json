Appointments at the leadership levels should be based on competence, knowledge and experience. Any other consideration will be at best sub-optimal.’’ Olusegun Obasanjo \nObasanjo, who turned 80, last week, stressed the need for strong family values because ‘’a nation consists of communities and families constitute communities. Therefore, the stability of the nation depends on how stable or robust the families are and consequently the communities. The nerve centre of national stability is the families.’’ \nThe former President spoke, yesterday, while delivering the 2nd Prophet Gabriel Olubunmi Fakeye Memorial Lecture held at Cherubim & Seraphim Movement Church, Surulere Distict Headquarters, Lagos. The lecture was titled: ‘’The Challenge of Good Governance, National Stability and Development.’’ \nAt the event where a book: ‘’The Renaissance of the C&S Church in perspective; The Story of C&S Movement Church, Surulere,’’ was launched, Obasanjo described Fakeye, who was C&S General leader/District Chairman (1970-2015) as ‘’a very consumate leader who was fearless when discussing national issues. He was patriotic and highly respected pastor, teacher, preacher, intercessor and field commander of the Lord’s army. He symbolised one of our finest examples of how a life truly dedicated to our Saviour Jesus Christ can make a difference. He had been a difference-maker for his family, his friends, his flock, his community, the Church and, indeed, the nation.’’ \nHe said it was good that the lecture series were inaugurated ‘’to remind us about his (Fakeye’s) ledership roles and for us to keep in constant view those nationalist ideals that are critical for national progress.’’ \nTo ensure national stability and development, Obasanjo canvassed concentric levels of leadership that encourages every person to act as a leader within his/her concentric ring.
