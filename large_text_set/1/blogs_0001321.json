An anonymous reader quotes Fortune: A new French law establishing workers' \"right to disconnect\" goes into effect today . The law requires companies with more than 50 employees to establish hours when staff should not send or answer emails . The goals of the law include making sure employees are fairly paid for work, and preventing burnout by protecting private time. French legislator Benoit Hamon, speaking to the BBC, described the law as an answer to the travails of employees who \"leave the office, but they do not leave their work. They remain attached by a kind of electronic leash -- like a dog.\" The BBC reports that France already has a 35-hour work week , while Fortune adds that many European companies have already taken steps to curtail after-work emails. \"In 2012, Volkswagen blocked all emails to employees' Blackberries after-hours ,\" and \"Daimler took the step of deleting all emails received by employees while on vacation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:57:01.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
