With everyone pushed to limit, a dramatic turn of events sees Weatherfield’s most prominent clan facing some of their biggest challenges. \nWith the loss of Daniel Osbourne and Sinead Tinker’s baby, Peter’s split from Toyah Battersby, Adam’s dangerous grudge and Tracy’s patience being tested, Ken has a lot to juggle as his relatives reach rock bottom.\nPeter rails at Ken, accusing him of ruining his life by telling Toyah about stalker Chloe’s claims that he cheated on her. Tracy is less than happy with Ken too, accusing him of caring more about Daniel and Adam than he does about her and Amy.\n(Picture: ITV) Amy herself is up to no good and seems to have had enough of the tension and, when she goes missing, Tracy and Luke are concerned. But when Amy lies about just having stage fright at her violin recital, what is she hiding as she glances moodily at No.1?\n(Picture: ITV) Meanwhile, watching from afar, Adam also has his own scores to settle, feeling pushed out by his relatives and feeling angry at Ken for his actions that led to him being beaten up by drug dealer Ronan.\nAcross the Street, Daniel fusses over Sinead following her miscarriage and believes that the stress on her recently could be the cause. As Sinead assures Daniel that she is fine, Daniel confides in Ken about feeling he is to blame for putting pressure on Sinead and Ken masks his own guilt over the tragedy.\n(Picture: ITV) With Sinead insisting that Daniel takes his chance and goes to Oxford, he is torn.\nAs tensions rise in the Barlow household, family rows escalate with Tracy, Daniel, Ken and Peter all pulled into arguments in No.1.\n(Picture: ITV) The Barlow family is in utter turmoil – but what will the consequences be as the almighty clashes rock the clan? Could Ken’s health be at risk again given that his last stroke was triggered by a fight with Peter?\nOne to watch: Monday 27th March at 8:30pm on ITV.
