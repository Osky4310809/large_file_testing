With simple make-up and accessories, the sister of Girls actress Jemima Kirke's confidence was bountiful on the red carpet. \nShe also made a statement by not covering up her unshaven armpits, while the rest of Hollywood has probably spent the last few days getting every back, sack and crack waxed, Lola was the exception.

But then they rewrote the part. And they had my character in a sleeveless dress, unloading groceries. So when I got to the set I said to the director, 'Hey, I don't shave my armpits. Do you think that the character would? If you do, I totally understand, but I can also think of reasons why she wouldn't.' He was like, 'Let me see your armpits.' \" Lola looked gorgeous with her brunette tresses loose (Photo: STARTRAKS PHOTO) \nKirke recalls, \"It was a room with thirty crew members, all men for the most part, and I went like this.\" She mimes holding her arms aloft for inspection. \"He looked at each armpit, carefully considering them. Finally he was like, 'Yeah, I think she would shave her armpits.' I said, 'OK, that's totally cool. But I do think it would be really interesting to be the first male, mainstream director in American cinema to feature a woman with armpit hair in your film and not address it.' \n\"And he thought about it and he said, 'OK. Keep it.' \" \nLola's red carpet look failed to distract from a night of British glory, with UK stars and TV shows dominating the awards with SIX top gongs going to UK actors or programmes. Actors Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone (Photo: AFP) \nThe BBC smash The Night Manager and Netflix behemoth The Crown were both hailed as some of the best shows on TV at the moment with both walking away with a host of senior awards at the prestigious event. \nNews of the British victories came on a night where Hollywood sharpened its claws for the President-elect Donald Trump - and paid tribute to tragic Carrie Fisher and her mum Debbie Reynolds. \nHugh Laurie, Jimmy Fallon and Meryl Streep were just some of the A-listers using the platform of the show to slam the Republican - less than two weeks before he is due to be sworn in.
