Photo: John Storey/Special to The Chronicle \nEver since David Lynch closed his beloved restaurant St. Vincent , about a year ago, we’ve all been wondering what he would do next. \nLynch is a longtime fixture of the American wine scene: He was wine director of San Francisco’s Quince and Cotogna , as well as Babbo in New York. He’s also a James Beard Award-winning wine writer and the author of “Vino Italiano: The Regional Wines of Italy” with Joe Bastianich and “The Wine Snob’s Dictionary” with David Kamp. \nNow, he’s pivoting away from restaurants. He told Inside Scoop that he’s joined SommSelect , the Sonoma company co-founded by Brandon Carneiro and Ian Cauble, a master sommelier who starred in the 2013 documentary “SOMM.” Related Links David Lynch discusses St. Vincent, now open in the Mission Lynch’s title? Editorial director.\nSommSelect, which was launched three years ago, sends one daily wine offer every day to an email list. It’s part flash sale, part sommelier service. The appeal of SommSelect is the sense of discovery — you’ve got some very qualified folks choosing these under-the-radar wines for you — achieved through the wine description in the e-mail. “A fragrant, savory, cashmere-textured snapshot of this unique place in the wine world,” is how today’s email (Jan. 30) described a Syrah from Domaine La Blaque in Provence. \nAs Lynch sees it, writing this sort of copy is precisely the kind of work he did while serving wine in restaurants. Plus, of course, he’s a gifted writer. \n“It’s a great combination of skills for me,” he said. “Taking the wine-buying acumen of a restaurant and putting it in written form.” \nIt represents a new challenge for Lynch, too. “Since we don’t have the ability to look someone in the eye and pour them a taste,” as he would if he were in a restaurant, “we have to do that in words.” \nNote that he’s not just “copy writer.” The editorial director title, Lynch acknowledged, does hint at some of SommSelect’s broader ambitions. He hopes to add a blog to the website, for instance. “The longterm goal is to make SommSelect incorporate other voices to complement Ian’s – broaden the realm of sommelier input,” he said, hinting at an eventual goal of having more contributing writers. \nEditorial content is not the only change on SommSelect’s horizon. Lynch said they plan to introduce events, too. \n“There’s so much potential,” he said. “What it evolves into, editorially, is partly up to me.” Esther Mobley Search Keyword search across all the entries in this blog.
