Her phenomenal run famously included a successful raid on the 2012 renewal of the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot. \nIt is not just through Black Caviar that Helsinge has created a legacy though, as she also produced All Too Hard, a four-time Group 1-winning son of Casino Prince who now stands at Vinery Stud in Scone, New South Wales. All Too Hard's first crop are currently two-year-olds. \nHelsinge also has another son at stud, with the ten-year-old Moshe, a brother to Black Caviar, standing at Sun Stud in Victoria. His first crop are currently three. \nHelsinge is also survived by her three-year-old daughter Brigite, a sister to All Too Hard, and Naturale, a four-year-old sister to Black Caviar, both of whom are owned by Jamieson. \nHelsinge never raced herself but was a half-sister to the Australian Group 1 winner Magnus and Group 2 winner Wilander. \nWhen in 2013 the Racing Post polled readers for their favourite broodmare of recent times, Helsinge came second with an impressive 15 per cent of the vote, behind Urban Sea on 27 per cent but ahead of big names such as Hasili and Height Of Fashion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T12:54:07.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
