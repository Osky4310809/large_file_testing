Upon defeating the White Martians, we see M’gann M’orrz, Miss Martian (Sharon Leal) herself leave the show. \nThe character, a major player in Geoff Johns's run on Teen Titans, M’orrz is probably best known to TV audiences from her appearances on the animated cult hit Young Justice. \nIn addition to her time as Miss Martian on Supergirl, Leal has a number of notable credits to her name, including multi-episode arcs on Private Practice, Hellcats, and Grimm. \nM'gann is actually a White Martian who decided to become \"good\" and elected to look like a Green Martian instead. The concept of White Martians was introduced in the eleventh episode of Supergirl's first season, when Martian Manhunter had to face one down. \nThere had been some speculation that due to the on-again, off-again Titans series that Warner Bros. Television was trying to develop, Miss Martian may have been off the table for Supergirl. While at one point it didn't look like a Titans series would materialize, M'gann's depature from Supergirl may reopen those questions. \nMORE: Supergirl: Who Is Armek? / Supergirl Recap with Spoilers - The Martian Chronicles / Supergirl Season 2 Episode 11: The Martian Chronicles Featurette \nDistributed worldwide by Warner Bros.
