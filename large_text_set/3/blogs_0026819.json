A 2016 report by bestplacestowork.org placed the agency near the very bottom of the barrel — No. 299 of 305 agencies surveyed. That was a slight improvement from 2015, when ICE was second-to-last in employee satisfaction. \nMuch of the discontent throughout the agency stems from a “a toxic and failed management culture,” according to Crane. The union head says field personnel have “zero faith” that agency leadership is willing or able to carry out needed reforms within the organization. \n“‘Screw up and move up’ is the general term used by many ICE employees to describe their supervision from their first-line supervisors all the way up to the Director of ICE,” Crane said. “‘Screw up and move up’ obviously denoting that our worst employees are the ones promoted to supervisory and leadership positions.” \nCrane also lamented what he thinks are inadequate staffing levels for Enforcement and Removal Operations, the division of ICE that is tasked with tracking down and arresting illegal immigrants subject to deportation. At 5,000 officers, the group is much too small to police at least 11 million illegal aliens estimated to be present in the U.S., Crane said. \nTrump’s February executive order made hiring more ICE personnel a priority , instructing the agency to “expeditiously” hire 10,000 agents and officers, as well as additional mission support and legal staff. \nCrane concluded his testimony with a warning to legislators contemplating an immigration reform bill that includes amnesty provisions, saying it would invite “a run on the border.” \n“The United States must stop dangling a carrot and drawing people into this country, encouraging them to violate U.S. laws,” he said. “Interior enforcement is the key to effective border security, which up to this point has been ignored.” \nSend tips to [email protected] .
