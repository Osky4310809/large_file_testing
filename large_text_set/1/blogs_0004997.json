And why would the tag be bigger than the bottle? \n— Who the hell sits like that? \n— What’s wrong with Detective magazine? \n— What exactly do they publish in Murder magazine? Household cleaning tips? \n— What sort of “evil” person sits around in a chair, smiling, while reading magazines? Shouldn’t he be, you know, murdering someone? \nAny answers would be appreciated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T13:16:55.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
