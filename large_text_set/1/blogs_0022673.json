Until now, the only LTE-enabled option for Gear S3 fans was the more rugged-looking Frontier edition. For now, the smartwatch is available exclusively through South Korea’s SK Telecom. The carrier is selling it for 451,000 won, which is around $390.\nSK Telecom has also developed three watch faces in partnership with Samsung that bring the look and feel of a traditional watch to the Gear S3 Classic LTE. They come with a ticking sound as well as a night light mode. These three watch faces are exclusive to the newly announced smartwatch and can be downloaded via the Galaxy Apps Store.\nSee also: HTC’s “Halfbeak” smartwatch appears again in new photos 4 days ago As of now, there’s no word if the Gear S3 Classic LTE will remain exclusive to SK Telecom and South Korea or if it will eventually come to other markets as well. Hopefully, Samsung will release a statement regarding the subject soon.\nIn the meantime, SK Telecom is also offering what it calls the “Gear Happiness Compensation Program” that can provide a discount of up to 50,000 won — around $43 — to those who buy the new Gear S3 Classic LTE smartwatch while returning a different Gear S device. The offer ends on March 31.\nSmartwatches haven’t really taken off yet, but they do have their share of fans around the world. The are quite a few of them to choose from, but the Samsung Gear S3 is definitely one of the best, mainly because of its rotating bezel that really makes the device easy to use. With Android Wear 2.0 right around the corner, we’re expecting two new Google smartwatches made in collaboration with LG.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T15:05:35.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
