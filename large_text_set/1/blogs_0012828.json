Built today for tomorrow, the Special Field Air Force 1 is the new Force of the future. The latest iteration of the iconic AF1 first launched late last year and quickly made a dent in the market. As such it comes with little surprise that Nike continues to build on the silhouette with new colorways and material combinations.\nThe military-inspired SF AF-1 blends a ripstop ballistic nylon upper, removable dual ankle straps, and a hidden Espionage Pocket in the tongue to deliver unmatched urban utility and versatility. For Spring 2017 the Nike Special Field Air Force 1 comes in four new colorways: black, dark navy, off-white and desert. Look out for a release from select retailers come January 19.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T11:05:34.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
