Highlights of the EFL Cup Semi-final match between Liverpool and Southampton \n\"We created a lot of chances over the two legs, and we missed a few, but when you go through the whole tournament without conceding a goal, you've got to do that with some good defenders in your side. \n\"We did it without arguably our player of the season so far in Virgil van Dijk. He's barely been mentioned tonight because of the fantastic job that Jack Stephens and Maya Yoshida did in the centre-back positions.\" \nClaude Puel's side have the chance to emulate Southampton's FA Cup winning side of 1976 when they take on either Manchester United or Hull City at Wembley on February 26. Maya Yoshida, Oriol Romeu and Jack Stephens starred for Southampton at Anfield \nDespite coming in domestic competition, Jamie Carragher likened the Saints' impressive display to a vintage European away win, where their organisational prowess suffocated a tame Liverpool attack. \n\"For a few years Southampton have been a tough nut to crack,\" he added. \"Under Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman they were always very tough defensively. \n\"Yes, Liverpool missed a couple of chances but there was never that feeling that Southampton were under that much pressure. That was down to the job the midfielders did, the likes of Oriol Romeu. Claude Puel gives his reaction after his Southampton side reached the EFL Cup final after a 2-0 aggregate win over Liverpool \n\"Young Stephens was never put under pressure because Liverpool couldn't get at him due to Southampton's organisation. \n\"It was a like a brilliant European away performance from Southampton, they soaked up pressure and hit them on the counter. Southampton looked far more dangerous than Liverpool did all night.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:57:22.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
