The insurance package gives enrollees two years of hardware repair coverage and technical support, along with two prorated repairs for \"accidental damage\" like cracked screens.\nSEE ALSO: Future iPhones could catch screen cracks before they turn into major problems\nThe plan itself isn't changing at all — it still costs $129, with repair premiums of $29 for screen damage and $99 for anything else you might need fixed if you really thrash your phone. The extension brings the iPhone's protection plan in line with those offered for AppleTV and Macs, which are also available to owners for a full year after purchase.\nThe AppleCare+ extension hasn't been announced officially yet — MacRumors first reported the update citing info from \"a senior AppleCare advisor.\" Apple's website still lists the eligibility period as 60 days, but we confirmed the extension appears for U.S. customers after checking Apple's eligibility tool with the serial number of an iPhone bought before the 60-day mark.\nWe've reached out to Apple for definite confirmation of the extension, and will update this article upon receiving a response.\nBe careful, though — as always, AppleCare+ is insurance, not a shortcut to cheaply fix an already damaged device. If you elect to add iPhone coverage after you buy your phone, Apple reps are required to check your device for any damage in store or run a diagnostics check remotely if you buy online.\nWATCH: A new way to take selfies — and six other features the iPhone 8 might have", "external_links": ["https://checkcoverage.apple.com/", "https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/17/applecare-plus-iphone-one-year-to-purchase/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/whfsXByr.jpg", "http://www.apple.com/support/products/iphone.html", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/whfsXByr.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-20T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:09:26.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
