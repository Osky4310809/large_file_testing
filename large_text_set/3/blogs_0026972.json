Humiliation \nTrounced 3-0 in their own backyard by the English just two weeks ago, including a 186-run humiliation at Kensington Oval in the final match, the two-time former World Cup winners continue to languish in ninth spot in the rankings on 84 points, five behind the Pakistanis, who will want to ensure they maintain that eighth spot and even improve to advance automatically to the World Cup. \nPakistan have already pipped the West Indies for the last available spot at June’s Champions Trophy in England, and although the Caribbean side will still have the chance to get to the World Cup via the qualifying tournament in Bangladesh next year, failing to qualify as one of the top eight teams will be seen as yet another embarrassment for the one-time undisputed kings of the game. \nIn what is believed will be his final series before bowing out of the international game, Misbah ul Haq will then lead Pakistan in three Tests at the conclusion of the ODI duel as the visitors seek to make history by winning a Test series in the Caribbean for the first time. \nPakistan briefly reigned at the top of the Test rankings during the series against the West Indies in the UAE last November, although defeat to Jason Holder’s men in the final Test in Sharjah not only halted their quest for a clean sweep of the entire campaign but triggered a decline with the Pakistanis being swept in two Tests in New Zealand and three in Australia. Teams: \nWest Indies \nCarlos Brathwaite (captain), Evin Lewis, Chadwick Walton (wicketkeeper), Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Jason Mohammed, Kieron Pollard, Rovman Powell, Kesrick Williams, Sunil Narine, Samuel Badree. \nPakistan \nSarfraz Ahmed (captain/wicketkeeper), Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Nawaz, Imad Wasim, Sohail Tanvir, Rumman Raees, Hasan Ali, Wahab Riaz. 0 0 WIndies look to revive fortunes against depleted Pakistan was posted in sports   Sport, Sport News, Geo News, Latest Sport News, Cricket, Pakistan Cricket.   \"WIndies look to revive fortunes against depleted Pakistan\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/135435-WIndies-look-to-revive-fortunes-against-depleted-Pakistan .
