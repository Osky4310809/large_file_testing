They left that mostly to states and local governments. It wasn’t until the 1970s that a president enacted the kind of national health care policy we’d recognize today. But even some presidents who failed to pass large scale changes had a major impact on the United States’ health care programs and policies. Here are 7 commanders in chief who helped shape the system—and debate—that we have today. 1/7 Getty Images Theodore Roosevelt \nAfter serving two terms from 1901 to 1909, Roosevelt—formerly a Republican—created the Bull Moose Party and ran again. Roosevelt was one of the first prominent politicians to support a national health insurance program. (He’s often quoted as saying , “No country can be strong whose people are sick.” But whether he ever actually said or wrote those words is unclear.) \nWhile his support for nationwide coverage didn’t lead to new health care laws, it gave fans of public health programs some momentum. 2/7 Getty Images Franklin D. Roosevelt \nBy the time Teddy Roosevelt’s distant cousin took office, the Great Depression had left many Americans without medical services of any kind. FDR supported legislation that would have created a nationwide, publicly funded health care program. But his proposals were ridiculed by opponents as “compulsory health insurance,” and he eventually dropped them from his New Deal reforms. 3/7 Getty Images Harry S. Truman \nDuring and after WWII, Truman supported the creation of a national medical insurance program as part of his “Fair Deal” program. While his efforts tanked, Truman drummed up wider public interest in the issue of government health care. During his presidency, the IRS also passed new tax laws allowing businesses to deduct the cost of employee health insurance, which led to many more Americans securing coverage. 4/7 Getty Images Lyndon B. Johnson \nDuring and after the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, American public opinion shifted, and national health care programs grew in popularity. People were living longer, and the issue of sick, uninsured seniors was becoming a big concern. That concern helped LJB pass laws creating both Medicare and Medicaid—programs designed to help the elderly and the poor pay for care. 5/7 Getty Images Richard Nixon \nWhile his proposals were watered down compared to those of his Democratic counterparts, Nixon’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) called for universal coverage. Because of politics, Nixon’s opponents—and also some of his fellow Republicans—disagreed over aspects of CHIP. These disagreements continued until the Watergate scandal broke, and universal health care faded away in the ensuing uproar. 6/7 Getty Images Bill Clinton \nWhile some of his predecessors enacted tweaks to national health care and health insurance, by the time Clinton took office in 1992, public opinions showed a lot of Americans were stressed about rising health care bills and the prospect of losing coverage altogether. Clinton appointed his wife, Hillary, to lead his Health Care Task Force. The resulting 1,400-page Health Security Act, which we know now as “Hillarycare,” called for universal coverage, as well as employer and individual insurance requirements. But both Democrats and Republicans took issue with parts of the bill, and lobbied for changes. Congress eventually shot down the act. 7/7 Getty Images Barack Obama \nYou know this part of the story. While deeply controversial, Obama’s Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was—after roughly 100 years of failed attempts—the first universal health care program to pass Congress and become law.
