If you’d like to receive it as a weekly early morning email, please sign up here . \nA quick plea: producing the Guardian’s independent, in-depth journalism takes a lot of time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters – and it may well be your perspective, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, become a Guardian Supporter and help make our future more secure. Thank you. The big picture \nThe rights of EU citizens in the UK are shaping up to become one of the key Brexit battlegrounds at home and abroad. \nIn Westminster, opposition peers are confident the government will have to make concessions as its article 50 bill passes through the House of Lords, although Theresa May is confident her timetable to begin talks in April will not be derailed. \nNo votes are planned in the Lords until the bill reaches its report stage next week, but Labour and Liberal Democrat peers say a vote on an amendment to secure EU nationals’ rights in the UK could come as early as Wednesday, and is winnable. \nOpposition peers also believe the government could lose on a second amendment demanding parliament gets a meaningful vote on the final outcome, with a dozen Conservatives, including Tory grandee Michael Heseltine, ready to back it . \nThe government insists the Brexit bill must and will go through the Lords without peers changing it. \nA row is also looming with the EU27 over the cut-off date after which EU citizens’ rights will no longer automatically apply . \nThe issue is likely to be a big bone of contention in Brexit negotiations, with those who arrived in the UK before the agreed date allowed to stay, and those who come after facing a stricter immigration regime. \nThe government is thought to want an early cut-off date to prevent a last-minute influx of EU nationals before the UK leaves. The commission and member states believe it should be the actual exit date – since until then the UK is still a member, and must respect EU rights and obligations. \nMeanwhile, analysis of government migration data suggests 28% of EU citizens are having their applications for permanent UK residency refused or declared invalid . The view from Europe \nBritish dosh is also a potential Brexit dealbreaker. The commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the UK could expect a “very hefty” leaving bill and would not be able to walk away without paying for commitments it made while a member: \nOur British friends need to know, and they know it already, that it will not be cut-price or zero cost. The bill will be … very steep. It will be necessary for the British to respect commitments that they freely entered into. \nThe Czech Republic joined Germany, Italy and France in insisting the UK must come to an arrangement on this divorce settlement – expected to come to about €60bn (£50bn) – before any substantive negotiations on a future relationship. \nMeanwhile, senior politicians from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia said the EU would negotiate as a unified bloc and doubted the feasibility of Britain’s aim of negotiating a free trade agreement within the two-year article 50 talks. \nAnd as the colourful language of Britain’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, continued to ruffle feathers on the continent, Anna Maria Corazza Bildt, a Swedish MEP publicly took him to task over his description of Brexit as a “liberation”: \nIn the history of Europe the word ‘liberation’ has a strong meaning … We are neither occupying you, nor a prison. Meanwhile, back in Westminster \nThis week the Westminster focus shifted north from London, as Brexit sages pored over the results of last week’s two byelections in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland in Cumbria. Both votes carried mixed messages about the various parties’ fortunes in the post-referendum era. \nThe headlines focused on Labour’s disastrous loss to the Conservatives of Copeland, a seat it had held since 1924. But this was arguably as much down to more general worries about the party under Jeremy Corbyn, and the Labour leader’s attitude to nuclear power, a big employer in a constituency which includes the Sellafield plant. \nStoke had been billed as more of a Brexit-focused battle, with the Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, parachuting himself in as candidate with the hope of removing Labour in an area that voted strongly for leave. \nBut even facing a pro-remain Labour candidate, Nuttall was well beaten – albeit with a slightly increased vote share. However, again this seemed less to do with Brexit than Labour’s superior local operation, and Nuttall’s various mishaps related to his recollection of the past . \nSimilarly, while May raced up to Copeland on Friday to hail the victory as showing her party could “deliver for everyone”, any unifying ability she currently has over Brexit seems mainly to do with Labour’s current chaos. You should also know: John Major became the second former prime minister in as many weeks to deliver a barnstorming speech attacking the government’s approach to Brexit and urging it to give voters an honest warning about the risks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:36:12.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
