It also generates similar levels of gluteal and hamstring activation as the barbell hip thrust, but less quad activation. \nIn addition, the range of motion with the glute bridge is less than that with the hip thrust. That's why this variation also tends to be a good place to start for beginners or people without access to a bench of the proper height to elevate their shoulders for hip thrusts. \nHowever, there's a slick trick you can use to increase the range of motion of the glute bridge. Bret recommends using shorter 25-pound plates over larger 45-pound plates. \nWhat's with the miniband wrapped above your knees? It both fixes your form (many trainees with weak glutes have knees that collapse inwards when bridging or squatting) and improves glute activation by forcing you to push out laterally against the band during the entire exercise. Though any miniband will do, Bret recommends a medium hip circle . \nTo perform the exercise like a pro, Bret says to: \n- Place the barbell just above your pubic bone with a bar pad like the squat sponge. \n- Keep your chin tucked and flatten your lower back against the floor to start each rep. \n- Lift your toes off the floor and push through your heels to maximize glute activation. \nBret recommends starting with 3 sets of 20 reps with a light load on the barbell (or just your bodyweight if needed). From there, progress to using a heavier weight for 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:20:30.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
