CBS Sports told The New York Post that the “service was down due to overwhelming demand.” \nThe timing was particularly awful given that the first game started at 12:15 p.m., by which time the site still wasn't back up. \nThat means thousands of people got shut out, and they were not pleased. Downdetector saw “CBSSports.com complaints” rise to over 2,000 per 15 minutes, The New York Post reported . \nHere's the graph: \nDowndetector.com \nIn the hours following the outage, an angry hoops-loving mob descended on Twitter to decry the situation. \n\"@CBSSports absolutely sucks!!\" wrote one Twitter user . \"Had my bracket all ready to go/submit and the d--- server crashed! Now I'm out money and have a blank bracket!\" \n\"@CBSSports your bracket challenge and website have been an absolute nightmare this week. Not to mention today's crash. Unacceptable,\" wrote another. \n\"@CBSSports That's no good, I have Notre Dame winning. Oh wait, no I don't. Because your site was down and I couldn't enter my bracket,\" joked a third. \nIn fairness to CBS, however, those people's brackets likely would have been busted already.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T15:55:41.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
