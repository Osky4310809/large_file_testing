Last week, we sat down with the Nike team and got a first look at the ground-breaking shoes. In order to go after their goal, Nike enlisted three elite marathoners : Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya, Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia and Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea. At an (as-of-yet) undetermined date on a fixed 2.4km loop combining portions of Grand Prix track and Junior track of the Autodromo Nazionale Monza complex outside Monza, Italy, these three athletes will set out on a course to run an elusive sub-two-hour marathon. \nIn setting out to create a shoe that would help the Nike team break the two-hour marathon barrier, they knew immediately that they would need to focus on the weight of the shoe, the stiffness and energy return, and the aerodynamics. But they also had to listen to the athletes and regard their feedback just as highly—and in this case, the athletes took Schoolmeester and his team in a different direction. Nike \nOverwhelmingly the response was that the ground hurts—the athletes didn’t want less shoe, they wanted something to protect them from 26.2 miles of pounding the pavement. \nThis feedback took them in somewhat of a counterintuitive direction—adding more foam to the shoe to give the athletes more energy return. For this project, Nike developed a brand new ZoomX foam that is a third the weight, but improves energy return by 13 percent. \nAnd when it comes to being efficient in each stride, runners depend on a certain stiffness in their shoes. But Nike didn’t want the stiffness in one area of the shoe to result in more work from another part of the foot or leg. With that in mind, the team developed new plates for this project. There is an S-curve to the design that supports the foot while simultaneously shielding the ankle and calf from taking on extra burden. \n“This plate is way stiffer than anything we’ve used in the past in a [running flat]” Schoolmeester said. “You get to have your cake and eat it too: you have more energy savings, yet you’re not doing more work elsewhere.\" \nHaving made these innovations, Schoolmeester and his team took the shoe to a physiology expert, Dr. Rodger Kram at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He ran some tests that showed the overall metabolic cost of running in this shoe versus other leading running shoes (including other Nikes), was four percent better on average. \nTo make Kipchoge, Desisa and Tadese’s bids to break the record even stronger, Nike has spent the last few years developing the Zoom Vaporfly Elite, which they have kept hush-hush until now. The shoe is a true one-to-one prototype that will be customized based on each of the three runners’ foot shape, individual stride and personal preferences. It all started with taking molds of their feet and making adjustments to the foam and plates along the way. The team at Nike will be making tweaks and little adjustments to the shoe up until the three athletes hit the course in Italy. Nike \nIn June, Nike is releasing the Zoom Vaporfly 4% for the everyman (and everywoman) looking to improve their personal pace. The Zoom Vaporfly 4% will hit the market at $250. According to Schoolmeester, it’s the commercial iteration based on the innovations the team has been working on for the Breaking2 project. Nike is also releasing the Zoom Fly, which will retail at $150. \n“We haven’t found any racers asking us to be slower, we’re basically telling runners you don’t have to make a trade-off: you can have cushion and support in your foot and you can go really, really fast,” Schoolmeester said. \nFor more news on Nike’s Breaking2 project, our sister Runner’s World is chronicling the entire process from start to sub-two-hour finish line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:54:14.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
