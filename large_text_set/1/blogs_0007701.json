Could   \nNigel Farage was forced to deny \"duping\" the British public over life outside the EU tonight after he was confronted on a radio phone-in. \nA caller accused the ex-Ukip leader of encouraging poorer voters to make themselves worse off during the first of his nightly LBC radio shows. \n'Chris from Manchester' told the ex-Ukip leader: \"You've led the working class and the least well off in this country to vote for something that's ultimately going to be very bad for them.\" \nHighlighting the plummeting pound, the caller told millionaire-backed Farage: \"That's not something that's going to affect you.\" Read More Ukip 'faces losing Â£1.3m' as anti-establishment party votes to quit its EU Parliament group \nHe said he worked for a chemicals firm which had seen the prices of its goods rise by up to 20% already. \nBut Mr Farage claimed there would be a \"genuine change\" to the marketplace thanks to migration controls in future. Nigel Farage also said he was \"worried\" about Theresa May's lack of Brexit 'vision' (Photo: LBC) \nHe added: \"I don't feel guilty about duping people into anything. I hope and believe I was as absolutely open and dead honest as I could be.\" \nThe exchange was one of the only pieces of criticism aimed at Mr Farage in his first nightly radio show on LBC. \nAnother caller, Tony from Canary Wharf, told him: \"I'm so glad you are where you are today. You have changed world history\" \nMr Farage bagged his job as a shock jock host after Tory ministers snubbed his plea to be a \"bridge\" to Trump's White House. \nDuring the show the Leave fanatic complained he is \"worried\" about Theresa May's lack of a Brexit plan. \nHe slammed the Prime Minister's refusal to reveal her \"vision\" for Britain outside the EU, adding: \"I want to know what the destination is\". \nMr Farage claimed two-year exit trigger Article 50 should have been activated last year because European leaders will be too distracted by French and German elections this summer. \nAnd calling for a global push for trade, he said: \"I honestly don't see that this Prime Minister has got the energy, the excitement or the flair to do it. \n\"I'm worried and I fear a very frustrating 2017.\" \nMr Farage will present his hour-long show on LBC four nights a week, Monday to Thursday.
