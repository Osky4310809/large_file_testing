His past “exposés” have been criticized for unethical editing practices. According to PolitiFact , O’Keefe’s videos are “edited in ways that the context of the conversation or the meaning of the statement isn’t always clear.” \nO’Keefe first gained notoriety for his 2009 headline-grabbing takedown of ACORN, a community organizing group that helped register low-income people to vote. He later pled guilty in 2010 to entering the federal office of then-U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu under false pretenses. In October, O’Keefe released a series of videos titled “Rigging the Election” that claimed to show how Democratic-leaning groups used a tactic tired to incite violence at Trump rallies. \nOther O’Keefe targets include NPR and Planned Parenthood.

On Tuesday, he told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he was ready to release the footage, hinting it might be CNN. \nHe confirmed that suspicion on Wednesday, tweeting a picture of himself in front of a screen that says “CNN tapes” along with the hashtag #CNNLeaks . \nObservers note that O’Keefe has had close ties to Trump, who has frequently criticized CNN as “fake news.” In October, NBC reported that O’Keefe’s organization, Project Veritas, received $10,000 from the Trump Foundation in 2015, just before Trump launched his presidential campaign. Trump also called O’Keefe after the election to thank him. \nO’Keefe was also mentored by the late Andrew Breitbart of Breitbart.com, the alt-right site formerly headed by Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon.

While the deal still needs regulatory approval from an administration that has been critical of both CNN and the merger, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has repeatedly stated that he expects the deal to close this year. \n— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) February 22, 2017 9 TV Newspeople Caught Up in Scandals, From Donna Brazile to Dan Rather (Photos) \nThe people who bring you TV news - sometimes they cross a line or otherwise find themselves embroiled in scandal.
