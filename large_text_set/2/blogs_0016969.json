Dejan Lovren has missed Liverpool's last two games with the knee injury. \nMeanwhile, Trent Alexander-Arnold has spoken of the benefits he gained from travelling and training with the Liverpool squad at La Manga. \nThe 18-year-old, who has made eight first-team appearances this season, was one of a number of talented youngsters who were reserved a spot on the four-day trip by manager Jurgen Klopp. \n\"I think because you're away 24 hours a day, you get to see what their whole routines are -- what they put into their body, what time they go to sleep, everything like that,\" he told the club's official website . \n\"You see how professional every single player is, and you're kind of surprised by it. You hear rumours about how professional the first-team players are at the academy, but when you're in and around it you actually see that nothing bad will go into their body because they know it won't help them, things like that. \n\"It's incredible because it just shows the level you have to get to and that's what all us youngsters are trying to do.\" \nAlexander-Arnold added: \"I think every bit of advice you get, you've got to take it because obviously the players are more experienced and they've been in the position that I'm in right now so they know the situation better than me. \n\"If they know how to handle it, it's best if they give me that knowledge and then I can absorb it and use it. I think that'll help me.\" \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
