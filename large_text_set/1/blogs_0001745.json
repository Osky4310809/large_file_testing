Facebook. \nFacebook is great. Facebook connects us. Facebook brings us together. Facebook keeps us in the know. And Facebook is exceedingly creepy. \nMaybe it’s the fact that Facebook coerces us into documenting every waking (and sleeping) moment of our lives for all the world to see. Maybe it’s because Facebook knows all of our personal information (stop asking for my phone number!!), all the things we like ( those ads on the side are targeted , folks), all the profiles we view (AKA secret crushes), AND not to mention its Messenger app knows all the trash we’ve ever talked in a private message. Do you know what kind of info you’re really signing away on Facebook’s terms and agreements? No? Nobody does. \nWhat originally started in 2004 as a social network for specific college students and alum to keep in touch with each other has grown over the past 13 years to incorporate a little bit of everything. And with its little Facebook fingers in dozens of different pies, Facebook has found ways both subtle and obvious to control our lives, making social networking much cozier, but also a lot more creepy. \nThink you’re the King or Queen of Creep? Keep reading to see the Facebook hacks and other semi-hidden features you didn’t know existed. Advertisement \nFacebook can be a pretty creepy place.
