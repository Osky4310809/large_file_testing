Even though the process to get visas and green cards took a year, her parents insisted on doing it the legal way. \n“(W)e support legal immigration only,” the 51-year-old personal trainer explained. \nTheir reward? Amselem’s parents were naturalized “with pride” just five years later, she said. \nWaqqas Khan, who emigrated from Pakistan in 2010, discussed the “tremendous hardships” he and his wife went through to become a U.S. citizen. \n“We served this country with our skills and compassion and owe a lot to America,” the 35-year-old physician said. \nAfter his experience with the immigration process, Khan has strong beliefs about those who try to circumvent it. \n“Being a legal immigrant to the U.S., I believe that immigration laws are of extreme importance for the sovereignty of a nation,” he explained. “I find elements defending and promoting illegal immigration utterly outrageous, offensive and racist toward hardworking, legal immigrants like myself and others of various colors, ethnicities, and backgrounds.” \nFunsho Adelabu, a 37-year-old inventory clerk, emigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria in 1997. \nAdelabu said he agreed with certain border laws that promote legal immigration, especially considering the hardships faced by those who follow the immigration laws. \n“It is not right for the working person to struggle and do everything by the book while others are here getting all the benefits, but not contributing like everyone else,” he said. \nJojo Reyes emigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines in 1973 to escape the dictatorship of U.S. ally Ferdinand Marcos. \nAs a pilot, Reyes has traveled around the world and seen, firsthand, the devastating effects of having open borders. \n“We should consider ourselves lucky to live in such a great country, far from the problems of these other third world countries, whose open borders continue to plague their communities with illegal and criminal immigrants,” he said. \nThese immigrants, along with the countless others who worked hard to become a U.S. citizen or resident, prove why protecting our immigration laws is so important to maintaining the spirit of America. \nIt’s not about keeping people out. It’s about protecting the validity of our laws and our country. \nLike and share this article on Facebook and Twitter if you’re glad to see these immigrants taking a stand for the laws that allowed them to come here legally.
