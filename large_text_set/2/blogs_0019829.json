Grynbaum (@grynbaum) February 21, 2017 \n\nOn Sunday a video posted on Twitter showed Yiannopoulos in apparent support of sexual relationships with children.\n\"No, no, no. You're misunderstanding what pedophilia means,\" he says on the video. \"Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty.”\nFollowing the revelation, a prominent speaking gig at the Conservative Political Action Conference and book deal with publisher Simon & Schuster were both rescinded on Monday. It was widely speculated Yiannopoulos’s future at Breitbart was also in doubt.\n“When your friends have done right by you, you do right by them.”Yiannopoulos’ statement concluded. “For me, now, that means stepping aside so my colleagues at Breitbart can get back to the great work they do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:52:14.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
