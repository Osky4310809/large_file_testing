Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports \nThe Boston Celtics, given the Sunday’s NBA blockbuster, appear to be sitting on the sideline at the moment. \nThe New Orleans Pelicans reportedly acquired DeMarcus Cousins from the Sacramento Kings late Sunday night for a price that certainly didn’t seem very steep at all. New Orleans sent back a package that included 2016 first-round selection Buddy Hield, a 2017 first-round pick and a 2017 second-rounder (via Philadelphia) to the Kings in exchange for the All-Star big man. \nThat seems like a very doable price for a team like the Celtics, who still have a surplus of very valuable trade chips, with the ability to swap first-round picks with the Brooklyn Nets in 2017 and Brooklyn’s first-round pick in 2018. However, the Celtics never seemed to get close to acquiring Boogie, and it sounds like they have their sights set on something else. \nLongtime NBA reporter Ric Bucher reported early Monday morning that the Celtics are preoccupied with finding a trade for Chicago Bulls star Jimmy Butler. \nSource w/reasons Pels got Boogie: Cs (too focussed on getting Butler), Orl (could've had him, balked) & Phx (Sac didn't want BKnight). \n— Ric Bucher (@RicBucher) February 20, 2017 \nThis certainly isn’t the first time the Celtics have been tied to Butler , and it’s unlikely those rumors die down anytime soon, at least not before Thursday’s NBA trade deadline. \nThis article first appeared on NESN.com and was syndicated with permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:11:36.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
