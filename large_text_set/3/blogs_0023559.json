Aside from Orefunwa, who is a graduate of Accounting Education, 25 others emerged in the first class division. \nIn her remarks, Orefunwa said that she sat for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination seven times before gaining admission to study at LASU. She attributed her feat to resilience and a desire to make her father proud. \n“I almost gave up after writing the UTME for seven years in a bid to gain admission into the university without success. I also applied to the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, three times without success. But with encouragement from my dad and elder sister, I eventually gained admission to LASU in 2012 to study Accounting Education. \n“My sister kept encouraging me and I started a professional career at the Institute of Chartered Accountant of Nigeria during the long wait for admission. I qualified as an Associate Chartered Accountant in 2010. My advice to others is that they should never give up in the face of daunting challenges,” she said. \nCopyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
