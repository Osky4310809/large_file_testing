While captured plenty of good-natured shenanigans, he also caught head coach Mike Tomlin taking a swipe at the Patriots.\nIn referencing both the fact that the Patriots get an extra day of rest and in firing up his team for next week, Tomlin said, \"Let’s start our preparations. We just spotted these assholes a day and a half.\"\nThe entire stream lasted almost 18 minutes and, as news of it spread across social media, Brown eventually took it down but this is the internet and everything lives forever so you can watch the whole thing below, via Deadspin .\nTomlin's comments begin at the 2:06 mark.\nIronically, as Brown's stream continues, Tomlin can be heard saying, “Keep a low profile... Keep cool on social media. This is about us, nobody else.\"\nAs for Tomlin's comments about the Patriots, it's hard to fault a guy for firing his team up as they prep for a game that will decide who goes to the Super Bowl, especially when the opponent is the most successful team of the last 15 years.\nAnd it's not like the Patriots aren't a source for ire; a Public Policy Polling poll after last year's Super Bowl showed the Patriots supplanting the Dallas Cowboys as the NFL's most disliked team (though maybe all those Deflategate headlines had something to do with it).\nBut the Steelers, who are currently nearly a touchdown underdog for next Sunday night's game in Foxboro, will need all the help they can get and that doesn't include giving Tom Brady and Bill Belichick more motivation.", "external_links": ["http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/02/americans-evenly-divided-on-super-bowl-brady-a-lightning-rod.html", "http://deadspin.com/antonio-brown-livestreams-mike-tomlin-calling-the-patri-1791251582", "http://www.espn.com/nfl/lines"], "published": "2017-01-17T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T18:34:36.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
