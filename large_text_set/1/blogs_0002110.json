Immediately, tributes from around the world poured out via Twitter, through art , and from her Hollywood contemporaries . \nAs her family and an adoring public tried to make sense of her death, tragedy struck again. Fisher's mother, Singin' In The Rain star and legend Debbie Reynolds passed away, just one day later. \n\nWith all this family tragedy in such a short time, every had to wonder: how would 24-year-old Billie Lourd, daughter and granddaughter to the two legends, cope? \ngetty images \nLosing any relative is painful— but losing your mother and your grandmother in just two days?? That's a kind of darkness you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. \n\nThe Scream Queens actress took to Instagram on Monday, after days of silence, to pay tribute to her \"Abadaba\" and \"Momby\" — and to thank everyone for their support in the wake of the devastating news. A photo posted by Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on Jan 2, 2017 at 10:09am PST \n\nLourd posted a childhood photo of herself with Fisher and Reynolds with the caption:\nReceiving all of your prayers and kind words over the past week has given me strength during a time I thought strength could not exist. There are no words to express how much I will miss my Abadaba and my one and only Momby. Your love and support means the world to me.\n\nWell, we're definitely not overcome with emotion right now. \nWe wish Lourd all the best in the coming months as she tries to find her footing. Luckily, the whole world and her very supportive fellow Scream Queens cast members have her back.
