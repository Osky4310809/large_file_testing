This is the first romantic song of Raees , after Sunny Leone's item number in Laila Main Laila, that has been released. We must say the lead couple, Mahira Khan and SRK complement each other and their chemistry is bang on! Moreover, the tune and the lyrics of the song will remind you of the 90s, which makes us feel good and nostalgic at the same time. The more you listen to Zaalima , the more it will grow on you.
