By: PTI | Published: March 27, 2017 4:47 PM Former Union Home Secretary and BJP MP R K Singh.(PTI) \nFormer Union Home Secretary and BJP MP R K Singh has said if somebody raises anti-India slogans will be thrashed. “We are not like people who remain silent even seeing somebody raising slogans like ‘Bharat tere tukde hoge’…we are nationalists and if we see somebody raising anti-India slogans we will thrash him,” Singh told reporters here yesterday. \nThough he did not refer to the JNU event last year when some protestors had raised slogans like “Bharat tere tukde hoge” (India will disintegrate), but his reaction was apparently in that context. \nYou may also like to watch: \nAsked about the choice of Aditya Nath Yogi as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Singh said “he is a good person and a nationalist.” \nSingh came here for inspecting construction of a railway overbridge. \nAfter retiring from service, Singh joined the BJP and was elected as Member of Parliament in 2014 from Ara constituency.
