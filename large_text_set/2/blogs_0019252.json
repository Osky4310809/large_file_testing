Mukesh Ambani at Reliance Jio media conference on Tuesday His return to the telecom business after a decade with offer of free voice and cheap data plans has shaken the Indian telecom industry, forcing incumbents to consider mergers and match its tariff.\nWith its Happy New Year Offer, which was similar to its initial promotional offer of free voice and data to attract customers, coming to an end on March 31, Jio will start offering its tariff plans from April 1. \nAmbani said all domestic calls to any network including STD and roaming will continue to be free. \nFor data, Jio will not only match the highest selling tariffs of each of the other leading Indian telecom operators but also provide 20 per more data in each of these plans, he said. \nFor the existing 100 million users, he announced a Jio Prime Membership programme wherein customers can enrol by paying one-time fee of Rs 99 and continue to get the existing benefits till March 2019 at \"a rock-bottom introductory price of only Rs 303 per month.\" \n\"For 170 days, Jio has added on average nearly 7 customers on its network every single second of every single day.
