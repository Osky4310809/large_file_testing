By Rebecca Sodergren / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nPittsburghers associate Isaly’s with its locally famous chipped ham, but old-timers also remember Isaly’s ice cream with fondness. \nGuess what? It’s back. \nFor the longest time, Isaly’s ice cream was a mere memory, but that changed in 2015. \nWith the Isaly family’s retirement, the Isaly’s company was sold in the 1980s to the Deily family, and ice cream fell out of production. In 2015, owner Tim Deily sold the company to Jim and Leslee Conroy, who own Blawnox-based Conroy Foods. \nConroy Foods opened in 1986, making Beano’s Original Deli Condiments. Because Conroy Foods already sold its condiments to delis, it was a natural move for Conroy to acquire Isaly’s because of the deli meat line, Mr. Conroy said. Plus, Mr. Conroy grew up in Blawnox and Mrs. Conroy in New Kensington, so the family had an innate desire to see a legendary Pittsburgh company preserved. \nDuring the sale process, Mr. Deily handed Mr. Conroy a big box of Isaly’s memorabilia: a scoop for making the company’s famed “skyscraper” cones, Isaly’s ice cream dishes, an Isaly’s store manual with recipes for ham spread and other deli favorites, and — lo and behold — a folder containing all the original ice cream formulas. \nThe Conroys had never done anything with ice cream production, but it took them only a month or two to decide that it was time they started. Isaly’s ice cream was too iconic not to reintroduce to Pittsburgh. \n“We owed it to Isaly’s Nation,” Mr. Conroy said. “This was a no-brainer.” \nThey worked closely with Giant Eagle, which is now carrying Isaly’s ice cream in all its stores. The ice cream is made at a plant in Ohio. Sales began Feb. 16 in select Giant Eagle stores; in the intervening weeks, the remaining Giant Eagle locations have picked it up. \nRight now there are six flavors available in grocery stores: Vanilla, Chocolate, Whitehouse Cherry (vanilla with maraschino cherries), Maricopa (vanilla with butterscotch swirl), Mint Chocolate Chip and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. \nIsaly’s will have a scoop shop inside PNC Park, and two additional flavors will be available there: Parrot Claws (similar to what other ice cream stores would call Moose Tracks) and Salted Caramel Truffle. \nMr. Conroy said they’re considering additional flavors for the grocery store line. Rick Sebak of WQED-TV and Brian Butko of Heinz History Center posted news of the Isaly’s ice cream re-launch on their Facebook pages, and “it just blew up,” Mr. Conroy said. In some of the comments, people asked for their favorite flavors to make a comeback. Two oft-repeated flavors — Toasted Almond Fudge and Rainbow — are under consideration for production late this season or early next season. \nMr. Conroy also is in discussions with other grocery chains to expand distribution from Western Ohio through Central Pennsylvania, the original distribution footprint of the Isaly’s company. And while ice cream shop owners have inquired about buying the ice cream for scooping, Mr. Conroy said the company isn’t quite ready yet, but it’s a possibility for the future. \nRebecca Sodergren: pgfoodevents@hotmail.com or on Twitter @pgfoodevents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:29:25.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
