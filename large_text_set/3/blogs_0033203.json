What does that mean? It’s time to find some DOPE books for your upcoming travels. Yassss. Looking for some ideas? Here’s a book recommended from some of the most book-loving celebs around — e.g. Lena Dunham, Emma Roberts, Dianna Agron — that will do the trick. The book is called The Rules Do Not Apply and is a memoir penned by renowned journalist Ariel Levy . We can’t WAIT to read it.\nLevy, who has been a staff writer for the New Yorker for nine years (so cool), wrote a powerful personal essay about her miscarriage in Mongolia in 2013 and decided later to write The Rules Do Not Apply , which centers on this experience and the illusion of “having it all”.\nI am moved by the way that Ariel Levy puts her world to words, by the life that she's lived and what she's shared with us in this memoir. This is one to be treasured. I highly recommend adding it to the list. \nA post shared by Dianna Agron (@diannaagron) on Mar 30, 2017 at 7:38am PDT \nLevy’s 2013 essay describes her miscarriage in traumatizing detail, purposefully, an approach she also takes with her book. In an interview with Refinery29 early this month, Levy says of this decision to write the personal essay and later her memoir, “I wanted to write about that because I think the fact that women are animals is sort of the last taboo. You can talk about sex now and no one cares, but we are supposed to be clean and shiny and not admit that blood comes out of our bodies again and again and again…”\nWe love it.\nIn shock I got to meet Ariel Levy! Author of #therulesdonotapply! It's truly one of my favorite books. Wildly important you read it as soon as possible. See more on the @belletrist insta story ☺️ \nA post shared by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Mar 29, 2017 at 6:35pm PDT \nIn her memoir, Levy discusses her liberal upbringing, her eventual move to New York City to become a writer, her marriage and lesbianism, an affair, and, of course, her miscarriage which led her to reevaluate her life.\nRoberts says, “It’s truly one of my favorite books . Wildly important you read it as soon as possible.”\nThe author also said, during the aforementioned interview with Refinery29, of her experience having a miscarriage and later discovering that she could not have children (and inherently could not have it all), “I could get in a dark place, but I roll with it. I don’t know how much of that is being in my ’40s and how much of that is about having the center of my life drop out when I was 38, but I’m not in a frantic state anymore.”\nShe continues, “When I first got back from Mongolia, I found the pain intolerable…I couldn’t stand the reality. But it became clear to me that I had no choice. It’s like walking up an escalator — you’re never going to get anywhere — but the sooner you surrender, the less you can be in physical pain.”\nSo powerful!\nThe Rules Do Not Apply by Ariel Levy is one of those engrossing books I just can't put down; train journeys are going by in a flash and I'm bumping into people on the platform . . . . #therulesdonotapply #ariellevy #memoir #ptv #commuter #reading #books #lillytales #bookstagram #currentlyreading #currentread #goodreads #bibliophile #ilovebooks #ilovereading #bookreview #booklover #bookworm #bookish #melbourne \nA post shared by Kate (@lillytales) on Mar 29, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT \nLena said of the book: “Ariel Levy is a writer of uncompromising honesty, remarkable clarity, and surprising humor gathered from the wreckage of tragedy. Her account of life doing its darnedest to topple her, and her refusal to be knocked down, will leave you shaken and inspired. I am the better for having read this book.” Amazing.\nWe have already added this book to our summer reading list. So excited to read more from Ariel Levy!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:40:40.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
