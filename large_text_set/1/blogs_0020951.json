And that’s a good thing, since Arya Stark actress Maisie Williams is giving only scraps of information about her character for the next season.\nWhile we understand that Williams can’t reveal any spoilers for Game of Thrones Season 7 — and we honestly wouldn’t want her to anyway — her vague response on the British talk show This Morning is particularly amusing.\nWilliams was on This Morning promoting her new Netflix film iBoy , but hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby had to ask Williams a question or two about Game of Thrones . Because when you have Arya Stark sitting in front of you, you must talk GoT .\nEven though both hosts realized how pointless it was to ask Williams for any real information on the upcoming season of Game of Thrones , they still gave it the old college try.\n“This year it really kind of heats up. Coming to the end of last season, the final episodes, it really just felt like we were setting up for the final —” Williams said before Schofield asked another question.” She added:\n“This year, everyone gets their trials and everyone get theirs tribulations, which is excellent. Particularly for Arya, there’s some really high points. There’s some really low points, too.” Uh, so yeah, that gives us almost nothing to work with — and Williams totally knows it.\n\nShe gave us more details in August 2016 after she had just read the script for Season 7 of Game of Thrones and tweeted her reaction:\njust finished reading season 7\n— Maisie Williams (@Maisie_Williams) August 22, 2016 shit gets REAL\n— Maisie Williams (@Maisie_Williams) August 22, 2016 i'd start preparing yourselves now\n— Maisie Williams (@Maisie_Williams) August 22, 2016 scratch that, nothing will prepare you for this\n— Maisie Williams (@Maisie_Williams) August 22, 2016 holy BALLS\n— Maisie Williams (@Maisie_Williams) August 22, 2016 Still, the fact that she referenced “high points” could mean that Arya reunites with her Stark siblings in Season 7 . Seeing Jon and Arya together again will make us even more emotional than when Jon and Sansa met up in Season 6.\nWilliams also teased on This Morning how Arya might not be in Season 8 — you know, like, if her character dies like so many GoT characters do — but we can’t emotionally handle thinking about that right now. Plus, we’re feeling confident Arya will make it to Season 8.\nSo, as per usual, we’ll have to wait until Game of Thrones Season 7 premieres to find out what really happens to Arya Stark — and we wouldn’t want it any other way.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:18:38.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
