Laura died just six months after her big day (Photo: Facebook) \nIT consultant Ben Kelly-Taylor told the London Evening Standard : “Laura was an outgoing person. She was very socially minded and loved spending time with people. \n“She wouldn’t let things get her down – she would work on them. She had a way about her of being warm and humble and making people feel comfortable. It was tragic. \n“A lot of people think their loved ones are special but in this case it really was true. I fell more in love with Laura as time went on and loved being her boyfriend and husband. \n“She had no reservations or doubt when she smiled – you could see she shone through. She was the same through and through – genuine and compassionate.\" \nShe worked for education charity City and Guilds and had a degree in psychology from Coventry University and a master's from the University of East London.

You cannot imagine the smile she had. \n“It was so devastating to lose her. Benjamin is devastated. They were so young. They wanted to start a family soon and were looking forward to having children and setting up a home together. \n\"But now that is all gone. You cannot imagine the amount of crying we’ve done.” \nA spokesman for City of London Police confirmed a 39-year-old man from Lewisham has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and released on bail until next month.
