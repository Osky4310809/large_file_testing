The U.K. is the largest aviation industry in Europe, and Britain could push back by barring EU carriers from operating domestic U.K. routes.\nFor more about Brexit, watch Fortune’s video: \nAlthough Ryanair is headquartered in Dublin, only 40% of its capital shares will be held by EU nationals after citizens of the U.K. are no longer included.
