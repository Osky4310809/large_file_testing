In this latest teaser, Scarlett Johansson can be seen once more in her starring role as Major, while we also get a first glimpse of the main antagonist, Kuze.\nJuliette Binoche, Michael Pitt, Chin Han, Pilou Asbaek, Beat Takeshi Kitano and Kaori Momoi also star in the movie, which drops in cinemas March 31.\nNow ask yourself, is the Ghost in the Shell remake racist?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:08:46.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
