He complained the redacted letter was proof there was “no openness” over why the council suddenly dropped a referendum on raising council tax by 15%. \nAndrew Neil, presenting, mockingly asked whether the letter was subject to a D-notice for national security reasons. \nHere’s how the conversation went: \nTory MP Kwasi Kwarteng, a Surrey MP who was appearing on the programme and had read the full letter, said that from his recollection it contained “no state secrets”. \nLeaving Andrew Neil to quip back: “Tell me about the government’s commitment to transparency?” \nKwarteng responded he would not answer on behalf of Surrey’s council leader. \nHuffPost UK contacted Hodge with a request for comment, but none was received. \nThe government came under fire this week after leaked texts from Hodge suggested ministers had struck a special secret “sweetheart deal” with Surrey Council to pay for social care. \nThe day earlier, Surrey abandoned it’s plan to hold a local referendum on raising council tax by 15% to pay for a shortfall in funding. The council approved a rise of just below 5% instead. \nDowning Street has denied Surrey received “extra money”.
