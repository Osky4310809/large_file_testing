The implications for this are more vast than you may think—the ability to replicate these sophisticated networks may pave the way for transplants using lab-grown tissues and organs. \nTo some degree, these type of 3D-printed networks have been printed before. But they were but were’t exactly game-changers: They were very expensive, time consuming to print, and less compatible with a living organism. \nOn the other hand, this version created by the UCSD lab can whip up blood vessels in just a few seconds rather than hours, according to Digital Trends . So far, they’ve been successfully tested on mice, and it’s likely that human trials are in the near future. \nPrinting out organs themselves is still far ahead on the medical horizon, though. Harvard University bioengineer Jennifer Lewis, Sc.D., told Nature that it may not ever be possible to print out kidneys and livers , for example. “I would love for that to be true,” she sais. “But these are highly complicated architectures.” \nStill, this recent advancement in printing out blood vessel networks could at least support some next steps toward that scenario.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T02:35:05.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
