Having already traversed a far more difficult path than many of their peers, it can only serve to further increase their burden.”\nTree also wrote that the process appears to be “of no benefit to the child” and “anything but in their best interests”.\nSince the Family Court process for cross-sex hormones was instituted in 2004, not a single teenager has been denied treatment.\nTree joins a procession of transgender people, their families, justices, legal experts and medical professionals who believe the court process is unnecessary.\nAdvocates say it is a “rubber stamp” process that does little more than delay treatment and provoke great anxiety in transgender children and families.\nBut despite criticism – and some signs of progress in 2016 – the process can only be overturned by a court appeal or by federal legislation.\nTree noted in his judgement that an appeal overturning the process is unlikely, given the court usually approves the application.\n“Therefore, in my view, there is an urgent need for statutory intervention in order to undo the consequences of Re Jamie ,” he wrote.\n“The sooner that children such as Lucas and their families do not have to endure the ordeal of litigation in order to get on with their lives, the better.”\nTree described the scene in the courtroom after he indicated that he would allow Lucas to start cross-sex hormones.\n“Lucas’s face relaxed into relief, and his mother, who was sitting at the bar table next to him, flashed him a quick, but revealing, smile. Lucas’s father commenced to openly weep … and remained doing so for the balance of the hearing. A tremendous burden was lifting.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:23:29.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
