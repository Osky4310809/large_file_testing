It's been a good two years since we've seen the talented actress on screen. However, the wait was totally worth it. She is part of the latest Netflix original series (out on February 3, 2017), Santa Clarita Diet , which is the story of a real estate agent, Sheila (Barrymore). Also starring Timothy Olyphant (in the role of Joel, her husband), the thirteen-episode series is the story of a married couple living a regular life in Santa Clarita (L.A.), with their teenaged daughter, Abby (Liv Hewson), until one day Sheila stops feeling her heartbeat. \nThe hilarious story of her dying (but still being undead), and eating people up will have you in splits. The best thing - there are zero Zombie vibes, just a mother trying to adjust to her new way of life. \nWatch the EXCLUSIVE trailer on iDiva, and let us know if you are as excited as we are.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T06:07:39.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
