If you plan to apply for student aid anytime soon, or if you’re already planning, here’s what you should know. \nIt’s not news. College tuition prices are ridiculously high and they’re only getting higher . For many prospective students, financial aid is critical to getting a degree. (And the stats show, a college degree still pays off ). Advertisement \nThat’s where the FAFSA comes in. Students fill it out to qualify for Pell grants, student loans, and other forms of aid. The problem is, the FAFSA form is extremely complicated and, for a time, applicants had to manually enter in the info. To simplify the process, the IRS released a tool that automatically filled in FAFSA data. The problem? That tool is now suspended due to security concerns . Here’s what the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators says students should know: \n...it is important that they know they can still complete a FAFSA without the IRS DRT. College financial aid offices can help students who are confused or have difficulty completing the free federal application. No student should be deterred from completing a FAFSA despite the loss of the IRS DRT. \nThe key word there? Should . You shouldn’t be deterred, but you’ll have to go back to entering info manually, which is a massive pain, not to mention time-consuming, especially with filing deadlines approaching. Unfortunately, aside from checking with your school’s financial aid office for extentions or advice, it’s all you can do. \nWhen you enter this data manually, you want to be extra careful, too. Errors could flag your application for a lengthy verification check, and that can conflict with college aid deadlines. Manually entry also requires a copy of your 2015 tax return. You can request a transcript of your 2015 return by mail, but it might take up to 10 business days. Otherwise, you can also request it online , but you’ll need the following, according to the IRS: Sponsored your SSN , date of birth, filing status and mailing address from latest tax return, access to your email account, your personal account number from a credit card, mortgage, home equity loan, home equity line of credit or car loan, and a mobile phone with your name on the account. \nIt sucks that the system is down, making the process more difficult for people who need financial help. Ultimately, you just want to be prepared for the extra time and effort this will take, but you can also check with your school’s financial aid office to see what they recommend, then get a copy of your IRS transcript here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:50:19.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
