I think you have to be in it, you have to be going through it in order to understand it. \n“From the outside looking in, it looks bad, and it’s even worse when you’re going through it.”\nNew York has had its fair share of controversy in recent weeks. Just days after team president Phil Jackson publicly chided Anthony on his Twitter account , Knicks owner James Dolan banned former All-Star Knickerbocker Charles Oakley from entering Madison Square Garden. \nThe same night Dolan announced the permanent ban, Knicks fans chanted “Free Charles Oakley” and “We want Oakley” during the team’s matchup against the Nuggets.\n#Knicks fans chanting \"Free Charles Oakley.\" pic.twitter.com/OoyLxM95sn \n— Kristian Winfield (@Krisplashed) February 11, 2017 If the chants were not a distraction, New York’s porous defense certainly was.\nThe Knicks allowed Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic to score a career-high 40 points on 74 percent shooting from the field. Six Denver players scored at least 13 points, and the Nuggets drained 16 of their 32 three-point attempts. \nKnicks coach Jeff Hornacek obliterated his starting lineup’s effort and motives, accusing them of fishing solely for offense.\n“Can’t guard anybody. Simple as that,” he said during his unusually short postgame press conference. “They should be embarrassed by the way they couldn’t guard anybody.\n“So those guys are happy scoring their points. We’re going to lose every game.”\nNew York did score 123 points, highlighted by Anthony’s 33 points on 13-of-20 shooting — 21 of his points coming in the fourth quarter. But the Knicks could not get a stop down the stretch, and a last-ditch comeback effort fell flat. \n“I mean, we all should be embarrassed just because of the way we’ve been playing, losing games,\" he said. \"Nobody likes to lose. Tonight it was bad. As players we’ve gotta take that upon ourselves and hold ourselves accountable for that. We have to do better, we have to do better on the defensive end. \n“Tonight was one of those nights where we should be holding ourselves and each other accountable for that.”\nStill, New York (22-33) isn’t completely out of the playoff picture. The Eastern Conference is top-heavy, and the Knicks, though 11 games below .500, are just 3.5 games behind the Detroit Pistons for the eighth seed in the conference.\n“Only thing that’s keeping us kinda sane is the fact that when you look at the standings,” Anthony said. “When you look at that, it’s about putting a couple games together and anything can happen. So yeah, we’re still optimistic about making the playoffs and what we can do. We just have to start doing it on a consistent basis.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:54:00.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
