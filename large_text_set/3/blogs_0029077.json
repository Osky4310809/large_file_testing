The alleged assailant in the Rockville High case is no more representative of all undocumented immigrants than the Border Patrol agent accused of sexually assaulting two sisters is representative of all border patrol agents. One byproduct of the rhetoric surrounding the Rockville High incident is that Montgomery County Public Schools district, where the school is situated, has been besieged by threatening and xenophobic phone calls, tweets and emails. One caller threatened to burn down the school; another vowed to \"shoot the illegals.\" How sad that for so many individuals, their response to reports of an unacceptable act of violence is to threaten more violence. And consider that some of these individuals who are so angry about the sexual assault allegations against an undocumented immigrant may well have supported a President with his own lengthy history of sexual assault allegations. Yes, perhaps the Rockville High attack might not have happened if the alleged perpetrator had not been in this country without authorization. But we don't know that -- just as we don't know yet if the allegations are in fact true. If we believe in the presumption of innocence, the cornerstone of our justice system, we should withhold judgment until the case has been tried in a court of law. \nStay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media.

Although the alleged attack by an undocumented student has generated outrage from everyone from Fox News host Bill O'Reilly to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan , it is not the first such incident. In the last school year, there were 250 sex-related \"serious incidents\" in the Montgomery County Public Schools district, 64 of which resulted in calls to police. Should one victim receive more attention because her attacker happened to be undocumented? Of course not. The same holds true for other cases across the country involving students who are victims of sexual assault. Crime is crime, and all of these cases deserve a complete investigation. The Trump administration is wrong to play the blame game with undocumented immigrants. Crime victims need support, not scapegoats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:43:27.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
