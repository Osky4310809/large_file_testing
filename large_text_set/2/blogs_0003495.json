His impact since he got in the league has been tremendous,” Brooks, a Hall of Fame linebacker said. “His combination – size, speed, rush ability not only reminds me a lot of Derrick Thomas, he’s making just as big of an impact on his teammates. He makes championship moment plays.” \nHall of Fame pass rusher Richard Dent remembers his first meeting with Miller on day he was drafted. The two were riding in a car together in New York where they shared a casual chat. Dent didn’t know at that time he would be looking at a man who could challenge some of his records. \n“I didn’t know that much about him then,” Dent said. “But he turned into a great ball player with great leverage. He’s going to be somebody to reckon with for sometime.” \nThe Broncos late-season struggles might have hurt Miller’s chances. Houston’s J.J. Watt is the only player in the past 10 seasons to win the award while playing a non-playoff team. Miller failed to make a sack in his final four games of the season. Mack didn’t have a sack in his final six games, including the playoffs.Mack, 25, also forced five fumbles, intercepted a pass and led the Raiders to their first playoff appearance in more than a decade. He’s well on his way to following Miller’s path to a big payday soon. \nMiller has a Super Bowl ring and MVP trophy while Mack does not, but the battle between the two likely will last for years. \nFalcons quarterback Matt Ryan was selected as offensive player of the year. Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was selected over his teammate Ezekiel Elliott for rookie of the year. Packers receiver Jordy Nelson won comeback player of the year. Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan was named assistant coach of the year.
