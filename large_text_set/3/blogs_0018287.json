Australia, Canada and Costa Rica all did better than the United States.\nOne reason America is getting gloomier: money doesn't equal happiness.\n\"The central paradox of the modern American economy ... is this: income per person has increased roughly three times since 1960, but measured happiness has not risen,\" writes Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist and special adviser to the UN Secretary-General who compiled the U.S. section of the report.\nWhy wealth doesn't always translate to happy people Even while the U.S. has managed to raise overall economic growth, it continues to struggle with issues like rising income inequality, corruption, and public distrust, Sachs writes.\nOn the other hand, the happiest country, Norway, performs well with factors such as freedom to make life choices, generosity, absence of corruption in government and business, and social support. That last one includes universal health care, something the U.S. is lacking.\nBasically, America's looking for happiness in all the wrong places, with its increased wealth only benefiting a select group while the rest of nation is left struggling to stay afloat.\n\"falling American happiness is due primarily to social rather than to economic causes.\" Decline in US happiness given its own chapter. https://t.co/idGc36kKSs\n— Jason Knoll (@jasonlknoll) March 20, 2017\n\"The predominant political discourse in the United States is aimed at raising economic growth, with the goal of restoring the American Dream and the happiness that is supposed to accompany it,\" Sachs writes. \"But the data show conclusively that this is the wrong approach.\"\nDealing with America's social crisis would require policymaking that tackles the biggest social plights at play, from distrust in the political system to the country's still rising income inequality that sees the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, Sachs explains.\n“Yet the dominant political discourse is all about raising the rate of economic growth, and the prescriptions for faster growth – mainly deregulation and tax cuts – are likely to exacerbate, not reduce, social tensions,\" Sachs writes.\n@JeffDSachs : Countries at the top of the happiness list give universal access to benefits, healthcare etc. #InternationalDayOfHappiness pic.twitter.com/JNUoiX64W8\n— Frederik Løgstrup (@FredeLogstrup) March 20, 2017\nSuch a strategy is precisely the one Trump has issued in the recent federal budget proposal . While throwing $54 billion into defense spending, he's cutting taxes and stripping funds away from several spheres of government — from the Environmental Protection Agency to the departments dealing with health and education.\nThere's also the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, with the GOP-endorsed replacement potentially taking away health care coverage from 24 million Americans .\nSome other reasons for American unhappiness are a climate of fear due to the \"open-ended global war on terror\" following 9/11, the role of big money in political campaigns and a deteriorating educational system, according to Sachs.\nThe UN report measures overall happiness through factors including income per capita, perceived corruption of government and business, social support, freedom to make life choices, life expectancy and generosity of donations.\nHere's a look at the top 20:\n1. Norway\n2. Denmark\n3. Iceland\n4. Switzerland\n5. Finland\n6. Netherlands\n7. Canada\n8. New Zealand\n9. Australia\n10. Sweden\n11. Israel\n12. Costa Rica\n13. Austria\n14. United States\n15.
