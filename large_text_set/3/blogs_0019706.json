SHANE GAMBLE TriHealth’s two flagship hospitals expect to divert a total of 38 tons of waste from landfills this year as a result of recycling plastic from operating rooms and other areas. Bethesda North Hospital in Montgomery is aiming to divert 22 tons of waste, while Good Samaritan Hospital in University Heights has a goal of 16 tons. That would total 76,000 pounds. Katie Schneider manages sustainability efforts for TriHealth. SHANE GAMBLE “Every hospital generates this material,” said Katie Schneider , who manages sustainability efforts for Cincinnati-based TriHealth. “A huge percentage of the waste comes out of our operating rooms. About 30 percent of the entire hospital’s waste stream comes out of the OR.” Employees of Cleanlites Recycling Inc., which has recycling centers in Carthage and Forest Park, collect the plastic. It’s sold to manufacturers and eventually transformed into car bumpers, picture frames, tent stakes, park benches and tables, Schneider said. Cleanlites hauls away material every week from Bethesda North and Good Samaritan. About 800 pounds a week is taken from Bethesda North and 500 pounds from Good Sam. “It’s all clean,” Schneider said of the plastic. “We only collect material pre-patient. Once a patient is in the operating room, we put the lid on the recycling bin because we don’t want to risk contaminating any of that material. “We have to make sure we stay on top of contamination because the material goes to a vendor that is not health-care-based,” she said. “We don’t want to put any of their team members at risk.” TriHealth has sought to reduce its environmental impact for years. “It really started with volunteers,” Schneider said. TriHealth’s formal sustainability program started in January 2014, when the hospital system created a full-time position for Schneider. In 2013, Bethesda North had a landfill diversion rate of 18.7 percent of all waste and Good Sam’s was 15.7 percent. In 2016, that rate rose to 25.9 percent at Bethesda North and 20.2 percent at Good Sam. Diversion also includes donations of clean, unused medical supplies, Schneider noted A formal waste diversion program launched at Bethesda North in 2015 focused on surgical “blue wraps,” the plastic used to ensure trays of surgical instruments and medical supplies remain sterile before use in an operating room. “It started real small, with just our blue wrap, and has grown and grown,” Schneider said. “We expanded to include things like foil wraps – there’s foil packaging on things – and all our supply boxes that instruments come in and paper pamphlets,” Schneider said. “We can put everything in one container. That helps make it a lot easier for team members. In the beginning, we were saying blue wraps in this container and paper in that one.” Now, Cleanlites employees hand sort the different types of recyclables, she said. Bethesda North diverted more than 8 tons of plastic waste in 2015 and more than 17 tons in 2016. “The team members at that location were really interested and passionate about trying to reduce our harmful impact and make a difference in their workplace,” Schneider said of Bethesda North employees. “They call it greening the OR. “Every team member in the OR is involved in that program, from the staff who are opening supplies and equipment and have to make sure they put it in the recycling bin and not the trash to our OR assistants who get the material from our ORs to our recycling room,” Schneider said. A formal waste diversion effort was implemented at Good Sam’s operating rooms this January and it's being expanded to other departments. “The lab at Good Sam has added on all their plastics as well, and the pharmacy at Bethesda North is also participating,” Schneider said. “It’s a slow migration out to other departments.” For example, Bethesda North’s labor and delivery department will begin pitching in March 27. Delivery, she said. Next, TriHealth would like to see how it can step up the diversion of waste generated at its other locations including Bethesda Butler Hospital in Hamilton and McCullough-Hyde Memorial Hospital in Oxford, Schneider said. The cost of paying to recycle the plastic is virtually the same as shipping such material to a landfill. “Our program is break even,” Schneider said. “We save a tiny bit, but it’s not worth mentioning. We’re spending the same amount on getting the recycling out as we would be to pay for it as trash.” So why bother? “Our sustainability program is embedded in our mission and values,” Schneider said. “Our mission of improving the health status of people we serve is carried out through our values, and one of our values is stewardship. That’s about making best use of time, treasures and talent, and that includes our environmental commitment. There’s a connection between the health of a planet and human health. “Through our commitment to environmental sustainability we strive to improve human health and well-being and provide high-quality care and patient experience while reducing our harmful impact on the natural environment,” she said. “That comes right from our environmental commitment statement.” Brunsman covers Procter & Gamble Co. and health care.
