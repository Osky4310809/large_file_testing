About.com Rating \nThe 2016 Stars on Ice Tour includes some of the best figure skaters in the USA. As with every Stars on Ice show, fans enjoy the show since so many great figure skaters perform together and individually. Sadly, for ice skating fans, the 2016 Stars on Ice Tour will only perform in six cities.

We had hoped to defend our 2015 US national title, but even though that did not happen, we know that figure skating is a sport, just like life, and we were thrilled to earn a bronze medal at the Boston 2016 World Figure Skating Championships . \nQuestion: What are you focusing on now as you prepare for the 2016-17 figure skating competition season? \nMadison and Evan: We are focusing on continuing to improve and we are taking one season at a time. Although we are very absorbed with our skating as we prepare for 2016-17 competitions, we also are working towards the end goal of being the best we can be by the 2018 PyeongChang XXIII Olympic Winter Games. Of course we hope to qualify and be competing again at another Olympics , and our experience at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi feels like it took place a long time ago. \nQuestion: Tell me about the programs you will be performing for the 2016 Stars on Ice tour? \nMadison and Evan: We are excited about the two new show programs we are doing for this show. Award winning choreographer Rohene Ward is responsible for our Beyonce program which has a hip hop theme. Olympic Ice Dance Champion Christopher Dean did the choreography for our other new show program which is so clever. He's a genius and the program \"Everyone is Free to Wear Sunscreen,\" also has great props and music and is so fun to do with Christopher's amazing choreography. We can't wait for the Stars on Ice audience to see that program! \nQuestion: What is your recommendation for young ice dance teams who wish to pursue a serious career? \nMadison: I would recommend for young ice dance teams to pick a group of people they trust and create a support system to help them as they pursue their careers. \nEvan: I would recommend that they work hard on and off the ice. Maintain a healthy relationship with your partner. Itâ€™s important that the ice dance partners work well together and get along . \nQuestion: Is there anything else you'd like to share with my About.com Figure Skating readers about the 2016 Stars on Ice show? \nMadison and Evan: We are having so much fun with this incredibly talented group of figure skaters and it's such an honor to work with world figure skating champion Jeffrey Buttle and be a part of Stars on Ice. There is so much creativity and talent in the 2016 show and the show is awesome! We encourage those who can see the show to come and watch us skate!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:36:35.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
