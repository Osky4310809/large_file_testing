Shares \nThere’s more than one way to kill a fascist. My favorite method in Sniper Elite 4 is pretty vanilla—a bullet through the helmet from very far away—but I also enjoy using the occasional explosive barrel or net full of cargo (dropped on a head). Once I filled a neighborhood with mines, fired my rifle into the air three times, and ran away. Any fascists who weren’t turned into mist walked into my scope. This is easily the best game in the Sniper Elite series. \nThere’s no voice in your ear telling you what to do: You’re on your own against a map full of AI soldiers. \nI haven’t been able to try Sniper Elite 4’s multiplayer yet, so I’m not committing to a final review right now, but I suspect the co-op and competitive modes will only make me like it more. I have played most of the campaign as of now, and it’s really good. The WW2 story about Allied subterfuge in fascist Italy is routine war game stuff—though I do like that I get to team up with Italian partisans and the mob—but the yappy cutscenes don’t intrude on hours of skulking through complex maps with a Springfield rifle and a pocket full of tripwire. \nEach mission drops you into a large map—think Battlefield size or a bit larger—with tons of enemy soldiers, multiple primary objectives, and several secondary objectives. Your main tools are: A) a set of binoculars to tag enemies with, B) a sniper rifle, C) an SMG and pistol, and D) medkits, mines, and as many satchel bombs as you need. \nThere’s no voice in your ear telling you what to do: You’re on your own against a map full of AI soldiers, who are thankfully an improvement over Sniper Elite 3’s buggy Nazis. I haven’t encountered a single noticeable bug in SE4 yet, even in the pre-release review build I was provided. Staying frosty \nIt's a game with gruesome slow-mo x-ray shots of organs exploding, including brains and balls, so I wouldn’t expect to find sleep darts. \nThe enemies are still simple-minded, though. Take a shot and they’ll hear it and take cover. Take another shot or two from the same location and it’s on: they know where you are and they’ll open fire. But they don’t have great eyesight. Run away without being respotted (a red ghost image of yourself shows you where they think you are) and hide for a minute and they’ll feebly search for you and eventually return to their routines. Classic videogame enemies: they witness you shoot the spleens out of a hundred of their friends and then go back to strolling around and mumbling. \nIf you wait for sound cover—planes overhead, artillery fire, or malfunctioning generators—you can ghost snipe. I once plopped down in a bush and spent 20 minutes killing soldiers on a bridge, using the explosions from a railway gun to mask my shots. I enjoy camping, though opportunities to have a nice lie down are rare. Sniper Elite 4 would rather you pack up and relocate often, but it does give you more opportunities to snipe quietly than Sniper Elite 3 did thanks to small supplies of ‘suppressed ammo’ you can carry. \nYou can also sneak into objective sites and use melee takedowns and suppressed pistol kills, but stealth in SE4 isn’t quite as fun and playful as it is in similar games, namely Metal Gear Solid 5. Sneaking is slow and the gadgets are straightforward: rocks to toss, a whistle, and explosives. The complexity maxes out at luring enemies to a spot—with a corpse, or an explosion, or a tossed rock—and blowing them up or shooting them when they get there. There are no cardboard boxes or nonlethal options. Granted, it is a game with gruesome slow-mo x-ray shots of organs exploding, including brains and balls, so I wouldn’t expect to find sleep darts. I can't help but think of the Crypt Keeper whenever this happens. \nI started having more fun after I stopped striving for stealth perfection. Instead of ‘how can I sneak in here and take out my target silently,’ the game has become ‘how can I kill every fascist on this map?’ \nOne tactic I’m fond of is to take a shot to make some noise, then circle around the alerted soldiers and embarrass them, shooting the backs of their heads while they look the wrong way. Or I’ll fully play it as an action game. On one big, green section of the Italian countryside, for example, I decided that a certain hill was mine, and disregarded stealth altogether. I ran to one side, then the other, and then back again for I-don’t-know-how-long, killing every soldier who tried to climb the hill and root me out. After that, I strolled up to formerly locked down objectives, satisfied by the knowledge that everyone who used to be guarding them was in a heap at the bottom of a hill. Taking the shot \nSniping is as simple or difficult as you want it to be. You can remove ballistics all together—bullets always go where the crosshairs meet—or include gravity and wind in the equation. Even with those influences turned on, letting out your breath slows time and produces a big red box that shows you where your bullet will go, so it’s still not hard to hit an eyeball. Bump up the difficulty to Hardcore, however, and it’s up to you to judge distance and wind. \nUsing the guide removes most of the challenge to aiming (it’s probably different using a controller) while having no guide requires intimate familiarity with a rifle’s bullet velocity, and is something I’d only attempt on a second playthrough. It does feel markedly better to sink a shot without such direct help, though, so I wish there were a middle ground. Maybe the red box fades away after a moment? It’s a tough thing to solve. I also wish the custom difficulty settings were more granular. I haven't found a way to remove the guide without playing in Hardcore mode, which removes a bunch of other HUD elements, like the minimap and ammo counter. It's possible I'm missing something, so I'll keep trying different settings, but it isn't obvious. Getting good enough to play without any UI help takes practice. \nAnother minor annoyance: Sniper Elite 4 tends to autosave in the middle of fights rather than during safe moments, and I've ended up reloading into near-death situations. Thankfully it’s possible to manually save whenever you want, which becomes a necessary discipline. The weapon progression isn’t great either. So far I’ve had no incentive to try guns other than my starting Springfield, which has better stats than any of the other rifles I could unlock thanks to upgrades I’ve earned by using it. And before the game’s even out, there are multiple greyed out rifles marked ‘DLC,’ which is disheartening. \nSniper Elite 4 runs great, though. The big levels take seconds to load on my SSD, it supports ultrawide resolutions, and outside of tiny graphical glitches I’ve noticed during cut scenes, it looks sharp. The animations and environments lack much in the way of character—most of it is best described as ‘World War 2 videogame art’—but the Italian hills and villas are pretty, and on my old Nvidia GTX Titan it runs at a comfortable 60-80 fps at 2560x1080. \nThere’s still a lot for me to play with—the entire campaign can be played in co-op, plus there’s a co-op survival mode and competitive multiplayer modes—but I’d be happy with Sniper Elite 4 if it were just the solo campaign. It's out on Tuesday, and I'll have a full review after I've done some sniping with friends.
