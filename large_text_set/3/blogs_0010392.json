He was 78.\nAndariese began working on the team’s radio broadcasts in 1972 and for 12 years was the network’s television analyst alongside Marv Albert before returning to the radio side. Andariese resigned in 2012, in part to spend more time with his family.\nThe Brooklyn native, nicknamed “Johnny Hoops,” was a three-time All-City player of the year at Fordham (1956-60). He was the Rams’ captain his senior year and led the team to a pair of NIT berths. Andariese was inducted into The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a Curt Gowdy Award winner in 2014 and also is enshrined in the New York City and Fordham basketball halls of fame.\nHis poor health was brought to light during ABC’s telecast of the Knicks-Warriors game earlier this month when play-by-play man Mike Breen, a longtime friend and colleague of Andariese at MSG Network, wished him well on the air.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:46:03.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
