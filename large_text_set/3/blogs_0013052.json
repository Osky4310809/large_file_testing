Photograph: The Guardian   Friday 17 March 2017 09.12 GMT Last modified on Friday 17 March 2017 09.14 GMT \nAn Iranian-born asylum seeker has been spared a return to immigration detention after officials indicated that Peter Dutton would decide in coming months whether she can live with her husband in Brisbane. \nMojgan Shamsalipoor, whose plight in detention as a Brisbane high school student sparked a high-profile campaign for her release , was granted another bridging visa on Friday, days before her current visa was due to run out. \nShamsalipoor, whose bid to remain with husband Milad Jafari has won a wave of public support, said she was “happy and grateful” for the reprieve “because at least I can stay with my husband and friends for another three months”.

Every three months I’m in limbo,” she told Guardian Australia. \nThe 23-year-old, who fled Iran citing sexual abuse at the hands of men including individuals with ties to the government, has been denied refugee status by the government. \nBut her lawyer Kevin Kadirgamar said her case officer had indicated that a decision from Dutton, the immigration minister, on her long-term future in Australia “might well be forthcoming” before her visa expired in June. \nThe department has issued the only visa it can while Dutton considers Shamsalipoor’s appeal to lift the statutory bar and allow her to apply in Australia for a partner visa. \n“He did decline to use that power last time but we know that since then he has used a separate power to grant Mojgan a bridging visa,” Kadirgamar told Guardian Australia. \n“That’s a clear recognition that there are compelling compassionate reasons that warrant Mojgan’s stay in the community. \n“We’re now asking the minister to reconsider in light of all the public support there has been since Mojgan has come into the community. \n“She has proven herself as well over the last six months. She hasn’t stayed idle, she has completed a certificate three in health services since coming out of detention, she has been employed, hasn’t gone on welfare – and that’s not to mention the compelling reasons she has to be with family.” \nShamsalipoor wrote in an opinion piece for news.com.au on Friday: “I’d rather die than return to Iran . It’s better to die, even aged 23, than to return to torture over there.” \nThe Iranian government has said it would not accept those who are forcibly returned to the country . \nShamsalipoor has been working as a retail assistant in a shoe store and is saving with hopes of studying midwifery at university. \n“I want to really feel the freedom for once and I want to stay here and be a normal person,” she said. \nShamsalipoor said the meeting with officials on Friday was “a bit positive”. \n“It was softer. It wasn’t like before, it wasn’t that much pressure. But still we don’t know what happens. So we’re just giving ourselves that hope that the minister will reconsider and let us apply for a partner visa.” \nShamsalipoor said the best part of returning to Brisbane from detention had been that “I’m able to live with my husband and be with him and spend time with my friends”. \nAn online petition calling on Dutton to allow her to apply for that visa had attracted almost 84,000 signatures on Friday. \nSupport like that showed “a lot of people are caring and I really appreciate Australian people because they are the ones giving me strength and hope to stay positive, which is beautiful”, Shamsalipoor said. \nShe said some people had greeted her on the street since her story – in which she and husband, Jafari, met at school in Brisbane, fell in love and married before she was taken away to detention in Darwin – featured on the ABC’s Australian Story. \n“It’s a beautiful feeling, to see people caring and they comment, say hello, say: ‘We have seen you, we are supporting you’. \n“It’s like they’re welcoming me, they’re accepting me as their own.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:31:40.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
