But there is too much at stake to gloss over the hatred Contact author   12.00 GMT Last modified on   12.02   \nI ’ve been thinking a lot about Kellyanne Conway’s recent advice on how to make sense of Donald Trump. Conway, one of Trump’s closest advisers and one-woman spin-machine, told Chris Cuomo this week that the mistake journalists make is that “you always want to go by what’s come out of his mouth rather than look at what’s in his heart.” \nI agree with Conway on one count - we can’t go by anything that comes out of Trump’s mouth. That’s because nearly everything he utters is a self-serving lie. \nIt’s makes sense, though, that Conway justifies supporting a dangerous egomaniac by convincing herself that what’s in his heart is somehow different than his words and actions. How else could she go on working for a person who has been reprehensible at every turn? \nIt’s easier for her and others who support Trump to ignore that he has bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy,” and mocked John McCain for being a prisoner of war. Better to forget, if you ever want to be able to look at yourself in the mirror again, that you empowered a man who called for the murder of women and children as a way to eradicate terrorists. A man whose defense against sexual assault allegations is that the accusers are not attractive enough for him to attack. A person who dismissively characterizes any unflattering news as “fake,” any criticism as reminiscent of Nazi Germany. \nYes, better to tell yourself that it’s what’s in Trump’s heart that really matters. Nevermind that whatever he feels is irrelevant; the harm he does is what truly counts for Americans. Trump hasn’t even taken office yet, and we’ve already seen the aftershocks of his rise to power, like the sharp increase in hate crimes and pre-emptive strikes at women’s health . \nConway may have convinced herself, along with Republican voters, that Trump is a good person deep down; but when the rest of us take a guess at what he’s really feeling it doesn’t paint a much more flattering picture. \nEven if we are to ignore the constant stream of invective that falls out of Trump’s mouth, this is a person we almost never see smile - only smirk. Can you imagine Trump ever feeling joy that isn’t based on the humiliation of another person? Can you picture him playing catch with his grandchildren? \nWhen you are holding on to the toxic combination of self-loathing and -aggrandizing that powers Trump, it’s a sickness too large to hide. \nPeople lie to themselves all the time. We believe abusive partners will change, that our luck will turn around despite all odds, that a cruel remark we made will have no lasting impact. Some of the lies we tell ourselves are forgivable. But Conway’s insistence that we trust Trump’s innate goodness is not. There is too much at stake to gloss over the hatred or to dismiss the horror. \nThis is a man who shows us who he is again and again - in that one way, this one time, we should believe him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T14:17:21.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
