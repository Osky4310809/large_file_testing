Blinding Them With Science: Russian MiG-35 to Fire Laser Weapon at Enemy Optics In an interview with Sputnik, Russian military expert and chief editor of the magazine Arsenal Otechestva Viktor Murakhovsky, touted the Tarantul aircraft electronic countermeasures system, which he said will help the Russia's Su-34 strike fighter to effectively protect other strike fighters from enemy radar.\nRight now, the Su-34 is equipped with the Khibiny aircraft electronic countermeasures system, which was developed by Radio-Electronic Technology Concern (KRET), Russia's largest radio-electronics holding company, founded in 2009. Russia plans to modernize Su-34 next year — https://t.co/R3YHsEViOY pic.twitter.com/y50mkTiR7E — Alert 5 (@alert5) 11 марта 2017 г. \nInstalled on the wingtips of Su-34s, the Khibiny system provides the jets with electronic warfare capabilities and enables them to carry out effective electronic countermeasures against radar systems, anti-aircraft missile systems and airborne early warning and control aircraft. \"The [Khibiny] system is quite effective, but for the time being it mainly provides individual protection for the [Su-34] aircraft,\" Murakhovsky said, adding that KRET is finalizing the development of an aircraft electronic countermeasures system capable of providing group protection. \nSeparately, Murakhovsky referred to another such system, which is being developed by the Kaluga Radio Engineering Research Institute outside Moscow. Russian Aerospace Forces to Get 16 Sophisticated Sukhoi Su-34 Fullback Bombers This Year https://t.co/O80zPSzEts pic.twitter.com/6BN9IWD848 — xairforces (@xairforces) 10 марта 2017 г. \"After that, the modernized Su-34 fighter bombers will enter service with the Russian Aerospace Forces; they will effectively appear in our VCS, which will effectively provide radio electronic protection to the other warplanes of a strike group,\" he said. \nEarlier this week, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yury Borisov said that Russia's Aerospace Forces will get 16 new Su-34 fighter bombers before the end of 2017, while the modernization of the aircraft will start in 2018. \nAccording to the deputy defense minister, the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association has a long-term contract with the Russian Defense Ministry for the production of a total of 92 Su-34 strike fighters. \nBorisov stressed that Su-34 aircraft have proved highly effective in the fight against terrorists in Syria. \nIn particular, it is worth mentioning that during the Syrian campaign, the Su-34 made effective use of its onboard arsenal of a 30 mm cannon, air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles and KAB-500S laser-guided bombs, allowing it to destroy terrorist infrastructure facilities and command centers. © Photo: Russian Defense Ministry Number One With a Bullet: Russia's New T-50 Jet Gets Sophisticated Shells The Russian Defense Ministry now wants to add to this from its impressive arsenal of anti-ship missiles, such as the modified Kh-35 missile and even plans to adapt the Su-34 to launch a new generation of so-called aeroballistic missiles.\nBased on the Su-27 fighter, the Su-34 is a 4++ generation jet, which can accelerate to a maximum speed of 1,200 mph (1,931 km) and can fly 2,500 miles (4,023 km) without refueling. \nNever miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T14:04:15.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
