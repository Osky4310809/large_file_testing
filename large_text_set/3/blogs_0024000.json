That much was made obvious after a heated text message exchange between a failed Tinder couple went viral. Giphy \nAfter just ONE date, a guy and girl practically ripped each other to shreds after the girl told the guy she wasn’t interested in him. However, the heated exchange wasn’t sparked after the guy lost his cool (for once). \nI say “for once” because it’s usually the guy who gets all bent out of shape when a girl turns him down. He typically results to calling her all kinds of horrible names to make up for his own insecurities. \nIn this case, however, the girl is the one who seemingly loses her shit after the guy handles his initial dose of rejection surprisingly well. Giphy \nFollowing their first (and last) date, the anonymous guy texts the girl the next day, saying, \nHey. I just wanted to say it was really great meeting you last night. Hope you’re having a great day! \nJust four minutes later, his Tinder date responds with the dreaded rejection text, explaining, \nHey. You too. You seem like a great guy. Listen… I really don’t see you as a romantic partner but I hope we can be friends. I hope I didn’t get your hopes up. \nOH, SHIT… He’s gonna go ballistic. \nUnfortunately for her, he actually responded rather calmly, saying, \nNo, not at all. I felt the same way, so I’m really glad you said that. \nLet’s just say she did NOT like his chill, honest response. Part of me thinks she would have preferred if he freaked out and lost his cool after she rejected him. A failed Tinder couple’s hilarious text messages conversation is going viral after a girl rejected her date. Imgur She didn’t take his calm response too well… Imgur Apparently, she was perfectly fine rejecting him, but when he said he “felt the same way,” she couldn’t accept it. Imgur After calling out his balding problem, the man stooped down to her level and criticized her weight, something he said “nothing about” until now. Imgur Things got worse when she mentioned his salary. Imgur Eventually, the intense, diss-riddled conversation ended with a good ole “fuck off, loser!” Imgur \nDamn, someone seems a little upset! \nLook, it’s hard to tell whether or not the guy in this situation actually “felt the same way” about his Tinder date. \nIt’s possible he actually was interested in her, but because she rejected him, he tried to play it cool by feeling “the same way.” Giphy \nHowever, it is also possible he actually wasn’t interested in her. And if that was the case, she should have handled her rejection the same way he handled his. \nRegardless, this is just one more Tinder “couple” who will never make it to the promised land of eternal love. \n*Pours champagne on the sidewalk* How Tinder Is Destroying Our Dating Skills [Disconnected] To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
