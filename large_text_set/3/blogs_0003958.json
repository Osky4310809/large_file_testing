I wish you could see this, my guy. Rest in peace.” (Photo: Coventry Telegraph) \nWhen Breon’s mum caught up with the singer at a meet and greet in London yesterday he hugged her and posed with a photo of her son. \nKelly, 39, told the Coventry Telegraph : “It was the most amazing moment when Stormzy was holding Breon’s photo. It was kind of like a dream come true for Breon, I was happy and sad at the same time. \n“Stormzy genuinely cares, he’s such a beautiful person. His video tribute just meant the absolute world to me. \n“Everybody said Breon was special. He was beautiful, kind, caring, we had a very special relationship. He was just my boy. The teen's mum thanked the grime artist for his words (Photo: Snapchat) \n“I’ve got to just be strong and make him live on.” \nThe funeral service, held at Stoke Saint Michael’s, on February 28, was full to capacity with mourners also gathered outside. \nThe Stormzy tribute was played at a celebration of life ceremony following Breon’s burial. \nIn the message Stormzy says: “Stormz here, I was actually meant to come down today. We was going to do a tribute for Breon, I was going to do Shut Up. Stormzy thanked the super fan for his support (Photo: Snapchat) \n“We would’ve all done it together – it would’ve been sick, but my head is not screwed on right now so for unfortunate reasons I couldn’t get down there. \n“But yo, I just want to pay my tributes, pay my personal respects, pay my homage because I knew he was a big supporter. \n\"I knew he was someone who enjoyed my music, loved my music, so I’m proper, proper upset that I couldn’t be there to celebrate his life, celebrate everything he’s done. Stormzy wanted to attend the funeral in person (Photo: WENN.com) \n“But I just want to say to you guys: keep your head up; keep your chin up; make sure you don’t harbour bad feelings about it as much as it’s the worst thing that could happen. \n“Let it be a celebration, let it be a beautiful thing, celebrate his life, celebrate all the good things, all the amazing memories you had with Breon. \n“And we’re paying him tribute man all day, bruv. I wish you could see this, my guy. Rest in peace.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:42:03.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
