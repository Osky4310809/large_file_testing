(Reuters) \nSiemens Limited and Siemens Rail Automation Ltd. S.A.U Spain have jointly won an order worth Rs. 287 crore to supply state-of-the-art signaling technology for the first two metro lines of the Nagpur Metro, the North-South and the East-West Corridors. The order received by the companies has Rs. 146 crore as Siemens Limited’s share. The project comprises the deployment and installation of the Siemens communications-based train control (CBTC) solution Trainguard MT for 38.2 kilometers of double track with 36 stations and two depots, as well as onboard equipment for 23 three-car trains. \n“Nagpur Metro will play a pivotal role in enhancing quality of life and economic growth of the city and the region. The Nagpur metro is a prestigious infrastructure project and we will deliver state-of-the-art technology that employs CBTC to maximise the network capacity while minimising operational costs,” said Executive VP Siemens and CEO Mobility Division in Lead Country India, Tilak Raj Seth. \nYou may also like to watch: \nThe modular and future-proven Trainguard MT automatic train control system is Siemens’ commitment and delivery to the comprehensive requirements of urban rail transport in India.
