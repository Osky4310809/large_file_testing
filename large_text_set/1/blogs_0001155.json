In fact, if this salad is any proof, we're still discovering ways to harness your incredible potential. In this flavorful take on the classic bistro salad — salade Lyonnaise — thin strands of kale and radicchio make up the base with bacon, eggs, and a surprising take on croutons topping it all off. \nEven better, we're showing you how to make this salad on a Sunday so you can enjoy it throughout the week. (Image credit: Christine Han ) The Sunday Night Salad \nThis is the salad you put together when you're meal prepping for the week. Each recipe in this series makes four entree-sized portions, which you can pack up for a week's worth of work salads or just dinner throughout the week. \nBecause we wanted these salads to last, all the major elements — the salad base, the topper, and the mix-ins — can be stored in the fridge anywhere from three to five days or longer without showing signs of fatigue. This is how you do Sunday salad prep right! (Image credit: Christine Han ) The Base: Kale and Radicchio \nKale and radicchio were made for long overnight stays in the fridge. They're some of the sturdiest leafy vegetables around and prove to be just as flavorful. As such, they do well when paired with richer dressing and toppings, making them a no-brainer base for this modernized take on the bistro salad. The Topper: Bacon, Eggs, and Classic Vinaigrette \nSince we're already taking some liberties with the base, we went classic with the toppings. Make the eggs how you like them, although we can't speak highly enough about how well soft- or hard-cooked ones last in the fridge when stored in their shell (up to a week!). Cooked bacon speaks for itself, and a classic vinaigrette — perhaps made on the acidic side — cuts through all the decadence with a bright, tart sword. \nGet More Make-Ahead Toppers: 5 Make-Ahead Toppings For A Salad That Keeps You Full The Crouton Bonus \nDoes a Lyonnaise salad have croutons? It's unclear, but we strayed this far already so let's keep going. For this salad, we actually took a detour to Rome and whipped up cacio e pepe croutons right on the stovetop. Pro tip: To pack this salad, simply ensure each component gets its own compartment in a travel container . Keep it in the fridge for up to a week.
