[2] Morgoth first discovered the limits of their sight prior to the fall of the great stronghold of Utumno . \nFor a time the King of the Eagles, Thorondor , kept his eyries at the top of Thangorodrim , the three mighty peaks that Morgoth raised from the Iron Mountains above the gates of Angband. While they lived there, Thorondor helped Fingon rescue Maedhros . [3] Thorondor's folk later removed their eyries to the Crissaegrim , part of the Echoriath about Gondolin . There they were friends of Turgon , and kept spies off the mountains. \nThorondor wounded Morgoth in the face after Morgoth's battle with Fingolfin , and carried Fingolfin's corpse to the Echoriath, where Turgon buried him. [4] \nThe Great Eagles fought alongside the army of the Valar, Elves and Edain during the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age . [5] Second Age \nIn the Second Age , a pair of Eagles had an eyrie in the King's House in Armenelos , the capital of Númenor , until the Kings became hostile to the Valar. The Eagles also watched the peak of Mount Meneltarma , and three Eagles would always appear when someone climbed to the summit. [6] \nTowards the end of Númenor , the Valar sent storm clouds in the shape of Great Eagles in an attempt to warn them of their folly and impending doom. [7] Third Age Bilbo and the Eagles , by Ted Nasmith \nIn the Third Age , Thorondor's descendants Gwaihir and Landroval lived in an eyrie to the east of the Misty Mountains in Wilderland . \nThese Eagles helped the Elves of Rivendell and Radagast in watching the land and in gathering news about the Orcs. [8] \nIn The Hobbit , no eagles were identified by name. Only the title Lord of the Eagles distinguished the eagle leader from other eagles in this story. [note 1] Many readers assume that it was Gwaihir and Landroval who rescued Thorin Oakenshield and Company from a band of Wargs and Goblins , flying them to the river Anduin , and later assisting in the Battle of the Five Armies fought near Lonely Mountain . [9] However, in Return of the King Gandalf says that Gwaihir has carried him twice before, while the proper count would be three times if Gwaihir and the Lord of the Eagle s were the same individual. \nBefore and during the War of the Ring , Gwaihir rescued Gandalf the Grey from the top of Isengard —having been dispatched by Radagast —and again from Zirak-Zigil . [8] The Eagles aided troops of King Elessar at the Battle of the Morannon at the Black Gate . The Eagles arrived in time to overthrow some Nazgûl , including Khamûl . Gwaihir, with others of his people, rescued Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee from Mount Doom in Mordor after the One Ring had been destroyed.
