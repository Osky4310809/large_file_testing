U.S. immigration officials simply rely on the person’s often rehearsed and fabricated “testimony.” I have personally seen this on hundreds of occasions.” \nBased on her experience, the refugee program is rife with “exploitations, inconsistencies and security lapses,” she explained, noting that it expanded “blindly” under the Obama administration, seemingly with no regard for security or the best interests of Americans. \n“As an insider who understands its operations, politics and weaknesses, I believe the refugee program must change dramatically and the courts must allow the president to fully implement the order,” she concluded. \nThe former State Department official is not alone in her support of Trump’s executive order. Recent polls show a majority of Americans support the president’s order on immigration and refugees .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T13:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:13:43.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
