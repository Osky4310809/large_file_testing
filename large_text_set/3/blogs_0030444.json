According to Joaquin Maroto of Spanish paper AS , Pique focused his ire on Spanish state attorney Marta Silva de Lapuerta and her relationship with Madrid. \"I've nothing against Real Madrid players but there are other things about the club that I don't like,\" he said. \"It wrangles with me to see the individual who is involved with the indictment of Messi and Neymar sitting in the VIP section of the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.\" Messi's family first addressed the issue of Silva de Lapuerta in November 2015 as the Argentinian striker was embroiled in a tax fraud case. A Catalan court found Messi and his father guilty of tax evasion in July 2016. Last November, Spanish prosecutors argued Neymar should receive a two-year prison sentence over financial irregularities stemming from his transfer to Barcelonaâ€”a scandal that accelerated the ouster of club president Sandro Rosell in 2014. There's no question politics have intertwined with Barcelona and Real Madrid's rivalry over the years, particularly during the reign of Francisco Franco. Spanish sport minister Miguel Cardenal argued in July 2016, however, Silva de Lapuerta's previous affiliations had nothing to do with court rulings. \" If this campaign is aiming to make some kind of complaint about a judicial decision, it is totally mistaken,\" he said per AS (via ESPN FC's Dermot Corrigan ). \" We are in an advanced democracy with an independent and competent judiciary.\" Like the new article format? !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:40:41.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
