Today in Paris Kendall Jenner stepped out wearing a Gosha Rubchinskiy x Fila shirt after the Alexandre Vauthier show (and after walking Chanel this morning). The piece came from a new release of Rubchinskiy’s buzzy Spring 2017 Menswear collection, which, in addition to Fila, included other throwback Italian sportswear labels like Kappa and Sergio Tacchini, as well as the Moscow-born designer’s signature insertion of Cyrillic. Adding a pop of contrast to the black shirt, the model threw on a denim shearling jacket and elevated the look with sleek leather flares. For a cheeky touch, Jenner sported a pair of optic white pointy-toe shoes with a Creeper-type platform. \nEastern European–centric looks seem to be a red-hot pick among celebrities lately. Just this past Friday, Bella Hadid wore two pieces by Situationist, an upcoming label from the post-Soviet republic of Georgia , while back in late December, Kim Kardashian West made headlines after she was seen in the Vetements x SVMoscow’s Communist-themed sickle and hammer hoodie. This star-studded salute to fashion from post-Soviet countries comes at a moment when political chatter about Russia is at an all-time high. Coincidence? Maybe. Either way, Eastern Europe’s impact in the fashion industry shows no signs of slowing down in 2017 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:26:43.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
