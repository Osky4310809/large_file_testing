When the dust settled, 27 suspects were arrested for their involvement in the crisis. \nAccording to information, the atmosphere became charged when the youths allegedly saw telephone numbers of four divisional police officers on the phone of the suspect. \nThe suspect, who was reportedly caught with the human head, attempted to call some policemen on phone after he was apprehended. \nThinking the suspect had some relationship with security agents, they reportedly thought that the suspect could be let off the hook. That was when they decided to deal with the suspect in their own way. \nSome policemen were said to have stormed the scene and attempted to dislodge the crowd with tear gas. The mob confronted the policemen, resulting in use of dangerous weapons, such as stones and irons. \nIn the ensuing crisis, a stray bullet reportedly killed a man. However, there were contradictory reports on the casualty figure. \nPolice story \nThe Police Public Relations Officer for Oyo State Command, SP Adekunle Ajisebutu said: “Reports that the suspect has telephone contacts of four DPOs is possible and there is no crime in having them. \n“Every member of the public should know that DPOs are public officers and their telephone numbers are always given to members of the public. \n“The police have the right to ensure that jungle justice is not passed on anybody. \n“I am the PPRO for the command and many members of the public have my number. If any of the people that have my contact is arrested for a crime and you find my number on his phone, would you say I am a culprit?” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T04:18:16.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
