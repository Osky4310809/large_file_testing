Gabriel Jesus that is, not to be confused with Gabriel Barbosa (i.e. Gabigol), who also made a big-money move from Brazil to Europe in the past year. Chelsea were briefly linked with Gabigol before he ended up at Inter Milan, where he’s done nothing of note so far in five appearances so far this season. Chelsea were not linked with Gabriel Jesus, but the 19-year-old already impressed enough in the three games he’s played for Manchester City since officially joining in January to kickstart the latest round of Sergio Agüero exit rumors. Agüero already made the rounds in the rumor mill back in October on the backs of some supposed nonsense between him and new manager Pep Guardiola and the latest rumors continue to use Pep’s supposed less-than-full bucket of enthusiasm for Sergio as the basis. Chelsea, alongside Real Madrid and Inter are rumored to be the ones monitoring the situation the closest, at least that’s what the Mirror are peddling. 1) Chelsea ready to steam in if benched 90+4 wants out of Man City at the end of the season #CFC #MCFC https://t.co/pDXIQOEmPt pic.twitter.com/oxMa2tqKJt Of course, Agüero’s agent just yesterday claimed that his client is “very, very happy” and that he’s willing to fight for his place with Gabriel Jesus and is looking forward to being there next season as well. While that doesn’t rule out City and Guardiola selling the £75m-rated 29-year-old — especially if the new kid ten years his junior continues to impress — for that much money, Chelsea could go after younger options themselves (Lukaku, Morata, etc). We missed the Agüero trade in 2011; there are no do-overs on that one.
