A new restaurant in Arlington Center features a wide selection of dishes from Southeast Asia. Noodle Market is now officially open at 470-472 Massachusetts Ave., where it took over for Sweet Chili, according to Boston Restaurant Talk . Sweet Chili served mostly Thai food and had been open for around 20 years. Noodle Market features Vietnamese and Thai dishes and is open for both lunch and dinner. The space reportedly underwent a “subtle makeover from Sweet Chili,” per a Chowhound user , and the vast menu includes a wide range of items, including shrimp fresh rolls, bun (vermicelli bowls), pho, dumplings, banh mi, pad thai, curry, fried rice, and more. The restaurant seats 60, according to Wicked Local , and it is open from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and from 11:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. on Friday and Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:18:14.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
