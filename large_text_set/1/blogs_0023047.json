But Milwaukee made them earn the win in the end.\nThe Celtics eventually hung on for a 112-108 overtime victory over the Bucks despite blowing a double-digit lead in a lackluster second half.\nIsaiah Thomas led the way with 37 points and eight assists. Jae Crowder (20 points), Kelly Olynyk (17 points) and Amir Johnson (11 points) also reached double-figures, while Jaylen Brown led the team with eight rebounds. Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 21 points and was one of six Bucks players in double-figures.\nWith the win, Boston improved to 29-18, while Milwaukee dropped to 21-26.\nHere’s how it all went down.\nSTARTING FIVE \nIsaiah Thomas, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, Jonas Jerebko, Amir Johnson\nOFF AND RUNNING\nOne day after scoring 39 points in the first quarter against the Orlando Magic, the C’s erupted for 42 points in the opening frame Saturday. And that once again was without the injured Al Horford and Avery Bradley.\nBoston made 7 of 14 3-pointers, 12 of 19 overall shots and 11 of 11 free throws in the opening 12 minutes. Crowder and Thomas both led the way offensively with 11 and 10 points, respectively. The C’s jumped out to a 13-2 start thanks to two Crodwer 3-pointers and a Thomas trey. Gerald Green later closed out the frame with a 3-pointer at the buzzer to make it 42-27.\nNeither team exactly lit it up in the second quarter, but that allowed the C’s to enjoy a 64-53 lead at the break. Boston’s lead went back to 15 after a Marcus Smart layup with just over a minute remaining in the half, but Milwaukee went on a mini 4-0 burst to make it an 11-point game.\n\nThomas scored 13 of the Celtics’ 22 second-quarter points, and he led all scorers at the break with 23 points. Michael Beasley led the way for the Bucks in the first half with 11 points.\nAND IT’S GONE?\nThe Bucks continued to peck away at the Celtics’ lead by outscoring the C’s 20-17 in the third quarter. As a result, they only trailed 81-73 entering the final 12 minutes.\nMilwaukee started the fourth quarter hot from the floor and went on a 7-2 run out of the gates, and a Antetokounmpo 3-pointer later helped the Bucks pull even with the C’s at 90 points apiece. The teams then traded baskets for the rest of regulation in what turned out to be a thriller.\nOVERTIME\nBoston scored the first six points in overtime to take a 108-102 lead, but Milwaukee tied the game on back-to-back Tony Snell 3-pointers, the second of which came with 1:13 remaining in OT.\nCrowder put the C’s back up by two with a pair of free throws with 28.8 seconds left, and he added two more from the charity stripe to seal the win.\nPLAY OF THE GAME \nSpeaking of that Green 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter…\nGerald Green beats the red light! pic.twitter.com/fABaWsiNLP \n— Boston Celtics (@celtics) January 29, 2017 \n\nUP NEXT \nThe Celtics will return to TD Garden for four straight games, beginning with Monday’s clash with the Detroit Pistons. Tip-off is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET. The C’s other thre home games that week are against the Toronto Raptors, Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers.\nThumbnail photo via Benny Sieu/USA TODAY Sports Images ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T05:47:39.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
