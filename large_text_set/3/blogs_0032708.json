He’ll be working behind that Philip Johnson-designed rosewood bar, with a dramatic sculpture of brass tubes overhead — except “cleaner” and “better lit” than it was in the Four Seasons era. \nHardwick comes by way of Betony, La Chine at the now-closed Waldorf-Astoria, the infamous Surf Lodge in Montauk, and — from way back — Mercer Kitchen, Pravda, and late Blue Owl . He also has his own beverage consultancy, drinkmarkt. \nChances are, he’ll be making variations on the martini — some frozen — poured from Christofle crystal decanters into conical-shaped glasses as opposed to coupes. Expect classic cocktails with subtle updates. “ Drinks will skew strong and dry,” Robert Simonson wrote, “in the postwar style. ” \nBREAKING: I can now happily share the news that I have joined Major Food Group as part of the bar team at The Grill. Housed in the former Four Seasons Restaurant space designed by Philip Johnson, it is an ode to the modernist American dining tradition of JFK, the 3 martini lunch and robust, devil may care dining. Steaks, chops, lobster, some amazing tableside theatrics and strong yet balanced cocktails courtesy of my man @gooddaysunshine415 that will arrive quickly and icy cold. Stay tuned for the official opening in April.
