Alexander Alegria’s pounced in the 75 th minute to give Betis a deserved lead before a last-gasp Luis Suarez effort saw the spoils shared. Barcelona should have drawn level far earlier than that, but Betis were given a big helping hand by the lack of goal-line technology in the Spanish top flight. Aleix Vidal’s cross from the right struck Betis’ Cristiano Piccini inside the six-yard box and crossed the line before it was cleared away by Aissa Mandi, but the linesman failed to spot that it should have been a goal. Coral revealed the moment of controversy: Coral @Coral La Liga doesn't have goal-line technology. The officials have ruled that this from Barcelona didn't cross the line... https://t.co/4Lj3DwQTBa 1/29/2017, 12:43:13 PM Even so, it’s safe to say Barcelona wouldn’t have been good value for a victory at Betis, as they barely got going during the match. The likes of Neymar, Lionel Messi and Suarez were struggling to carve open the Betis defence, and the hosts were proving a handful on the counter attack. Neymar did have one sight of goal after a flowing move from Luis Enrique’s men, but his effort was smartly saved by Antonio Adan to keep the sides level at the break. CRISTINA QUICLER/Getty Images In the second half, Betis set about punishing Barcelona for their sloppy play going forwards and laid siege to Ter Stegen’s goal. They came perilously close to taking the lead on several occasions as the clock ticked towards the 90, with Daniel Caballos coming particularly close from distance. The midfielder picked up the ball from way out and unleashed a stunning drive towards goal, but it came straight back out off the woodwork. Journalist Alexandra Jonson said he deserved a goal for his performance: Alexandra Jonson @AlexandraJonson Ceballos hitting the crossbar now, that guy truly deserves a goal in this game. What a performance he is having! 1/29/2017, 12:29:36 PM It wasn’t long before Betis rattled the frame of the goal again, this time through the ever-impressive Reuben Castro. A stunning run from the tricky forward got him into the Barcelona penalty area, but his right-footed effort rebounded back off the upright. Despite the warnings, Barca failed to respond and let their guard down once again from a corner, as Alegria stole in to give the hosts the lead. A poor punch from Stegen gifted Alegria the opportunity, and he took full advantage to send Estadio Benito Villamarin into raptures. CRISTINA QUICLER/Getty Images Then came the game’s hugely controversial moment, as Barcelona were denied a clear goal. The ball was two feet over the line before Mandi’s clearance, and the incident will only heighten calls for technology in Spain. Barca had 15 minutes to respond and earn a point, but the Betis rearguard was standing firm and resisted everything that was being thrown at them. It was going to take a moment of true magic or an error to allow Enrique’s men back into the match, and Barca prayers were answered by Nahuel Leiva. Having just come on as a substitute, Leiva gave the ball away to Messi in a very dangerous area and paid the ultimate price. Messi cooly slipped Suarez in, and he rolled the ball home.

Played superbly, worked so hard, but sort of crapped themselves late on. How good was Dani Ceballos though? 1/29/2017, 12:51:03 PM The result leaves Barcelona one point back of rivals Real Madrid, who also have two games in hand and can surge clear at the top of the tree in the coming weeks. Enrique’s side face a stiff examination of their title credentials against Athletic Bilbao next time out before Copa del Rey semi-finals against Atletico Madrid, when they’ll need a much better performance than Sunday’s to progress.
