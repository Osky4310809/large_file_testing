Well, she’s winning our hearts all over again with her fabulous style. At the BAFTA tea party, Millie Bobbie Brown looked like a tiny Audrey Hepburn. It’s no surprise how adorable and chic she looked. We all remember her adorable Kate Spade LBD with glitter fringe . Despite her overnight transformation ( which included an awesome head shave ) to one of Hollywood’s most famous young stars, we’re happy to see how Millie Bobbie Brown is handling her success with aplomb.\nBut seriously, we can’t get enough of Millie Bobbie Brown’s adorable black and white dress. Gregg DeGuire / WireImage That bow is to die for! And we love how she pairs her look with some coral lipstick.\nAnd here’s what it looks like from the front. David Livingston/Getty Images Mad props for that wave in her hair. Gregg DeGuire / WireImage Those dimples! That smile!\nWe’re delighted by her sense of humor on the red carpet. Gregg DeGuire / WireImage Plus, the scalloped edges of her sandals match her wavy hairdo.\nWe wonder what young Mike would think of Eleven if he saw her all dolled up like this? He’d probably faint. Of course, we still don’t know what is in store for our favorite crew of nerds in the next season of Stranger Things . We’ll just have to make do with the few clues we read online. Either way, young love will likely continue to blossom.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T19:21:34.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
