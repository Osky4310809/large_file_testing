The important thing has been to save energy thinking about [Tuesday’s] stage, which will be a crucial day all round. \n\"We’ll try to do the best team time trial we can and we’ll see where we finish,\" he said, naming \"Sky, BMC and Movistar\" as the top favourites, \"and it’s also true that they are amongst the big favourites for the overall as well.\" \nContador recognised that such a long team time trial in a week-long stage race, \"is something which will have a huge effect on the race overall, and it’ll shape the fight for GC. But I’ve got a great team, and I’m fully confident in what they can do.\" \nIn the 2017 Tirreno-Adriatico's 22km race against the clock, Trek-Segafredo finished in 12th spot, 58 seconds down on winners BMC Racing. On Tuesday, Contador will doubtless be hoping for a much better performance all round. \nContador's team will start Tuesday's race against the clock fourth out of 25 teams.
