Whenever I tried a new chair out for testing, the Auroza is the chair I found myself always wanting to go back to. The primary reason for this is the tension-controlled backrest that moves independently from the seat. Instead of adjusting and locking to a specific angle, like how you adjust the seat in a car, the Auroza backrest reclines when you lean back into it. The tension with which it supports you can be adjusted from totally loose, easily bending back to almost horizontal, to quite firm, with just a bit of give. I found a slight bit of give to be the most comfortable, leaning back when I intended to, but still providing proper sufficient back support. \nNot only did this movement feel the best on my back and rear, it's also the best for you ergonomically. As Tim noted in his traditional chairs guide, ergonomist Melissa Afterman says that being able to move regularly while you sit is one of the most important parts of a good chair. You want something that provides both upright support and the ability to recline when you want to relax. The Auroza ticks both those boxes. \nThe Auroza also felt the most comfortable in general design, not requiring a separate pillow (or two) for lumbar or head support. Armrests are adjustable in height and angle, but can't be slid around. While this might seem like a drawback, the lack of adjustment meant the armrests themselves felt much more sturdy. Some of the chairs I tested featured fully adjustable armrests, but being able to slide around meant they felt a bit wobbly, even when locked. Some armrests were also solid plastic, which got uncomfortable after a while. The Auroza's armrests are slightly padded so you don't bruise your elbows. \nPerhaps the most critical part of a chair is the actual seat, and the Auroza doesn't disappoint. It's firm, but soft enough that I never found my butt hurting, even after hours of sitting. This is in stark contrast to one of the competition, the Vertagear SL4000, which left me with a stiff back after only a half hour or so. \nThe biggest downside to the Auroza is its lack of color options. If you're choosing this kind of chair for the bucket seat aesthetic, you probably want your chair to match your rig. The $340 Auroza is only available in the light blue color seen above. There is a black and red variant that also features a totally unnecessary LED lighting flair, but that model costs more than $100 extra. Definitely not worth the extra money, unless you absolutely need the back of your chair to glow. How we test chairs and others we tested \nFor this guide, I mainly built on the great information started by Tim in his original chairs buying guide . In his research, he spoke with Melissa Afterman, MS CPE, a Senior Principal Ergonomist with VSI Risk Management & Ergonomics, Inc. who specialises in workstation setups. “Absolutely chairs are still okay,” she told him. “Yes we know that sitting too long is bad for you. The reality is that standing too long is just as bad for you, and so the answer is movement. Taking breaks, getting up at least every hour and moving, or changing your position from standing to sitting every hour so that you’re not standing too long either.” \nAfterman also made a point that a key element to consider is the backrest: \"If you’re typing and working at the computer, you really want more upright support so that you can maintain neutral spine posture and let the chair hold you up,” she said. “But when you switch to gaming mode, you may want to recline a little bit to relax your lower back, while still having good support in that position. So a locking backrest and/or some sort of tension control is important.\" \nAnother thing to look for in a good chair is a seat pan slider, but as far as I can tell such feature is only available on high-end office chairs. Our top pick, the Auroza, doesn't slide in the pan, but it's tension-controlled reclining backrest is about as close as you'll get on a racing-style chair. DX Racer Elite Series OH/EA01 \nOne of the most well known names in the racing-style chair business, DXRacer produces racing chairs in a wide range of styles. The one we tested was the from the Elite Series, which costs $300 direct from DXR . It has a decent build quality and is one of the more comfortable chairs we tested for sitting upright at the computer, but isn't the most comfortable for leaning back and relaxing during long gaming sessions. Vertagear SL4000 \nI had high hopes for Vertagear, as they're known for excellent build quality, but the SL4000 we tested was extremely uncomfortable to everyone who tried it. In the future I'd like to try out some of the others in the S-Line racing series and see if they aren't devastatingly uncomfortable. Vertagear SL5000 \nI've tried a few new chairs since this guide was created, and the Vertagear SL5000 is the best new addition. True to Vertagear's name, the SL5000 features top-notch materials and build quality. And thankfully, it's much more comfortable than the SL4000 we hated so much. The cushions are on the firmer side of things, but in a way that feels supportive, not uncomfortable. The only reason the SL5000 doesn't take top honors is, like most other chairs, the backrest recline is linked to the base. Until another racing-style chair offers the independent back movement of the Auroza X1, it'll remain our top pick. E-Blue Cobra EEC307 \nThe Cobra is one of the cheaper chairs we tested, available for $180 on Amazon , and it shows in lack of features. The back, armrests, and seat are all screwed together into a single piece, meaning you can't make any adjustments other than height. Sitting is about as comfortable as a standard office chair—one that you can't adjust. Noblechairs EPIC Series \nThe EPIC series from noblechairs is another of the more comfortable chairs we tested. Marketed as a luxury office chair, it features high-quality faux leather and suede, and all the standard adjustments except for the tension-controlled back on the E-Blue Auroza. Its cushions were also the most firm of all the chairs we tested, which is somthing to consider if that's what you're looking for in a chair. All in all, it's a great, high-quality chair, but at $500 on Newegg , it's also the most expensive. Future testing \nInevitably, we weren't able to comprehensively test every single gaming chair out there (it's a booming sector), so we plan to continue updating this guide as more chairs pass under the judgments of our butts. \nIn the future we'll also expand this guide to include a budget pick, though most racing chairs come with a price premium of a few hundred bucks anyway. Expect any chair under $200 to be pretty bare-bones when it comes to features. \nA note on affiliates: some of our stories, like this one, include affiliate links to stores like Amazon.
