We are very thankful to God for his Blessing when he called us to be their parents.I actually reached out for help from the organization known as the Department of Children Services. Only to have our children very abruptly removed from our home. They have been gone from our lives 80 and 90% of their lives. Damon is our oldest son. He is just over 3. Elijah is our youngest he has just turned two years old.Our children were taken based only upon accusations from a caseworker who had never met us, \nor been in our home. \nThis has become commonplace in America. We are desperately reaching out for people to sign our petition to help Spotlight these hideous atrocities that arse shattering homes.It is our God given inalienable right to be able to raise our own children without government intervention.There must be fax to the accusations before children should be removed from their homes. Our greatest fear now, as our babies have been in custody of the state for so long... that they are saying it may be in the best interest of \"\"OUR\"children to stay with foster care providers!I hope to raise some Awareness on this issue before the date of April the 7th 2017.That is the date that they plan to \"permanently terminate\" OUR \"RIGHTS\" as parents! We will never see our boys again... Please join with us as we fight for the right to to be loving \"parents\" that God has called us to be...And also help raise awareness to the misappropriation of so many billions of dollars of federal funding. \nPLEASE PRAYERFULLY consder to take the time to sign our petition to help save our children and preserve our family! \nMy God bless you and your family as well!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:57:22.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
