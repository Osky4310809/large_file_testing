Kim Ogg, the new district attorney in Houston, won office promising to make changes like dropping prosecution of low-level drug offenses, reducing the use of money bail and releasing videos of police shootings. Those priorities were much more aligned with the Obama administration than Trump’s, in whose pronouncements Obama-era buzzwords like deincarceration, constitutional policing and de-escalation — reducing the use of force during police encounters — have all but disappeared. Mr. Trump did tell a gathering of police chiefs this week: “As part of our commitment to safe communities, we will also work to address the mental health crisis. Prison should not be a substitute for treatment.” Ms. Ogg said Mr. Trump’s law enforcement speech would not prompt disagreement, but did not necessarily reflect new concerns. “No one in law enforcement is going to take a position against protecting law enforcement officers — but I think promoting equal justice and equal protection for everyone is the job of district attorneys, and our leadership,” she said. Mr. Trump has been silent about fatal police shootings of unarmed civilians — which until recently had monopolized conversations about criminal justice. Instead, he has spoken about the need for more aggressive policing to stem violent crime, including a threat to “send in the Feds” to quell the growing rate of homicides in Chicago. Some police chiefs said they are reserving judgment until there is more meat on the bones of the administration’s plans.

Mr. Sessions said at his swearing-in that a recent uptick in crime in some major cities is a “dangerous, permanent trend,” a view that is not supported by federal crime data.

Flynn, Milwaukee’s police chief, who also heads the legislative committee of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. “That to us is key. We don’t want any more policy bromides grounded in campaign promises. We want ideas grounded in practical wisdom about how to protect our cities.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Still, a number of chiefs — and perhaps the vast majority of lower-ranking officers — say they are basking in the glow of Mr. Trump’s positive attention after feeling under siege during the Obama administration. “Law enforcement in general was painted with a very broad brush,” said Michael J. Bouchard, the sheriff of Oakland County, Mich. “The idea was that policing was broke, and I think that was a false dialogue.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
