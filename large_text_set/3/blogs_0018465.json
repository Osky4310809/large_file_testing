Photograph courtesy National Geographic \nA new awards program honors teens who are making a difference in their world. \nTwo of three young adults taking home prizes from the National Geographic Student Expeditions Inaugural Teen Service Award are dedicated to mitigating climate change, while the grand prize winner is tackling literacy in low-income areas. \nIn order to enter the running for the grand prize—a National Geographic Student Expeditions Trip of their choice in summer 2017, plus a $500 college scholarship—teens had to receive a nomination from one or more of their peers. Nearly 300 nominations were submitted, with the goal of the contest to “celebrate the contributions of today’s emerging changemakers.” \nOne of those changemakers is 15-year-old Alexa Grabelle, the mastermind behind the nonprofit Bags of Books . As the grand prize winner, Grabelle will be joining the National Geographic Community Service Expedition to Fiji . According to Grabelle, she chose Fiji “because the community service involves working with children, the type of service work I love most!” \nIn recognition of her work, National Geographic’s Kids Books will also be donating 300 children’s books to Alexa’s organization. \nWhen asked about her aspirations, Grabelle said her ultimate life goal is “to travel the world while making a positive impact everywhere I go.” \nYou Might Also Like Super-Efficient Cars Are Doable But Hit a Political Speed Bump \nIf you are interested in joining Alexa on her quest to increase literacy rates, you can her to receive more information about running a Bag of Books collection in your area. \nTeen Service Award runner-up Delaney Reynolds, 17, of Miami, Florida, was recognized for her work with the nonprofit Sink or Swim Project . Reynolds will be receiving a $500 scholarship to put towards her college education. In her submission essay Reynolds wrote, “Global warming presents the most important challenge that my generation will ever face.” \nReynolds’ work, which includes illustrating and publishing three environmentally focused children’s books and presenting lectures to a total of nearly 35,000 people, has culminated in a project geared towards educating and engaging her generation to help solve the climate crisis. \nReynolds’ hopes Sink or Swim will educate as many people as possible, leading to reduced reliance on fossil fuels. She hopes to turn her native Florida from “The Sunshine State” into “THE Solar State.” \nIf you would like to get involved with the Sink or Swim Project, you can sign up to receive her blog or follow her on social media . \nAlso named as a contest runner-up is 18-year-old Kaimana Idica, from Wailuka, Hawaii. Idica will also be receiving a $500 college scholarship for his contributions towards educating the public about the impact of single-use plastic waste on the environment—and eco-friendly alternatives. For the past three years, Idica has been involved in everything from beach cleanups to creating films and giving presentations at high schools, in order to give back to his community and become part of the solution. \nIn the future, he sees himself continuing his work with organizations such as the Maui Huliau Foundation and the Ocean Friendly Restaurants Hawaii Campaign , as well as pursuing a degree in multimedia cinema and environmental studies at Hawaii Pacific University. \nIdica encourages everyone to use the power of their voice to enact change, regardless of their age. \n“Connecting with and benefiting communities around the world is a key focus of National Geographic Student Expeditions, and we are thrilled to have the opportunity to recognize students across the country who are making a difference in their own communities,” said Deb Friedman, vice president for independent and specialty travel for National Geographic. “We were blown away by the nominations we received for these awards.” \nIdica added, “Today our society has gotten lazy by living in a world of convenience. I cannot just look the other way and say, ‘Someone else will do it.’ There are too many people saying that already.” Join us in The People v.
