Unfortunately, we're not always aware of these talents, until they really come out and talk about it...or in some cases, get their own show! And a number of culinary-skilled stars have gotten their own successful cooking shows which are worth a watch. Here are five of them. While a few are not on air anymore, their videos are easily available on the Internet. Farah Khan - Farah Ki Daawat \nAce Bollywood choreographer and director, Farah Khan, added another feather to her cap in 2015 with her cooking show, Farah Ki Daawat . The show aired on Colors, and featured a multitude of her famous friends as guests, including Boman Irani, Abhishek Bachchan, Shilpa Shetty, and Anushka Sharma among others. Farah and her guests would cook a fun, new recipe each time, and the show was quite a hit. Amrita Raichand - Mummy Ka Magic \nThe model and actress turned chef in the cooking show, Mummy Ka Magic . The show was a boon for mothers who struggled with what to feed their children on a regular basis without making it unhealthy. Amrita's charming personality, coupled with the easy, delicious recipes she would put to the table has made the show a huge success. It currently airs on Food Food. Maria Goretti - I Love Cooking \nMaria made her way back to television last year, after a sabbatical of 14 years, with her cooking show I Love Cooking , on Living Foodz. The ex-VJ has been a veritable source for recipes and food inspo, and she even has a blog apart from a cookbook titled, From My Kitchen To Yours: Love, Food And Other Ingredients . Her show featured a mix of comfort food and experimental recipes, and was a breath of fresh air from the dull cooking shows we're used to watching. Zarine Khan - Spices and Secrets with Zarine Khan \nWife of actor, Sanjay Khan, and mother of Zayed, Sussanne, Farah, and Simone Khan, Zarine is the matriarch of an affluent Bollywood family. And this means that through her life she has hosted some wonderful dinner parties, which is what she aims to create on her show. Her Parsi heritage, coupled with the Muslim influence she garnered after her marriage inspires most of her cooking on the show. Not only this but some of her Bollywood friends and family members join her, and share anecdotes around her table. The show currently airs on Living Foodz. Gurdip Kohli Punjj - Baccha Party, All ‘Bout Cooking \nPopular television actress of Sanjivani fame, Gurdip, turned chef in 2013 for not one, but two cooking shows on Zee Khana Khazana - Baccha Party and All ‘Bout Cooking . In the first, the actress was seen cooking recipes that were nutritious, as well as delicious in order to help mothers feed their fussy kids. The second show saw her cook recipes that she was fond of, and one that were inclusive of not just kids but also adults.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T08:27:29.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
