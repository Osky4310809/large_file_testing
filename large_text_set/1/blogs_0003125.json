Along with that, ASUS is also pushing out the December security update for the previous generation ZenWatch.\nSee also: ASUS ZenWatch 3 review 4 weeks ago ASUS’ ZenWatch 3 is among the very few Android Wear watches that launched the second half of 2016. And as I wrote before, it may be the first time that an Android Wear smartwatch got everything right, from design to price. The watch comes with a 1.39-inch circular AMOLED display with a resolution of 400 x 400 and is powered by Qualcomm’s wearable-optimized processor, Snapdragon Wear 2100. All of that for just $229 .\nAlthough it hasn’t been that long since its release, the ZenWatch 3 is already getting a major update, which brings some new features as well as much-needed fixes:\nFix security vulnerabilities ( Update to Dec 2016 of Android Security Bulletins ) Improve the accuracy of algorithm. Improve the stability of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connection. Remove charging/discharging notification message. Update translations in various languages. Support algorithm of falling detection (ZenWatch Manager companion app v3.2.0.161220 is needed). Support ECO mode setting in the ZenWatch 3. Support “Button setting” for user customization Add new themes for watch face of Aureole, Golden Era, Silver Ribbon, Ostra, Geometry, Signature, Cruise. ASUS is also rolling out a minor software update for ZenWatch 2 users. It’s nothing exciting though – just the December security fixes, but hey, better than nothing, eh?\nDo you own a smartwatch?
