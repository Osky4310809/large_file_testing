If the shortfall is 50 percent or less of the MAB, then the bank will charge Rs 50 plus service tax. Reuters \nThe charges and MAB varies according to the location of bank. It is minimum in case of rural branches. \nA senior SBI official said the bank had suspended levying charges on breach of minimum balance requirements in 2012 to acquire new customers. \nThe charges are now being reintroduced from April 1. \nThe Reserve Bank has permitted banks to levy charges for breaching minimum balance limit. \nWithdrawal of cash from ATMs will attract a charge of up to Rs 20 if the number of transactions exceeds three from other bank's ATMs in a month and Rs 10 for more than five withdrawals from SBI ATMs. \nHowever, SBI will not levy any charge on withdrawals from its own ATMs if the balance exceeds Rs 25,000. In case of other banks' ATM there will be no charge if the balance exceeds Rs 1 lakh. \nSBI will charge Rs 15 for SMS alerts per quarter from debit card holders who maintain average quarterly balance of up to Rs 25,000 during the three months period. \nThere will be no charge for UPI/ USSD transactions of up to Rs 1000. \n 47   06, 2017 07:47 am Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T04:36:08.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
