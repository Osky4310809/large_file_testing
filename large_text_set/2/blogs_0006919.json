No matter which city you visit; no matter the corner of the world, chances are, if you know who to ask you can (and will) find knockoff versions of your favorite brands.\nThis time we visited Jamaica’s capital city and found our way to Kingston’s historic Coronation Market. The market was constructed after the accession of George VI in 1936, when Jamaica was still a British colony. Since then, it has become one of that largest and most frequented destinations in Kingston.\nLocated downtown just to the south of Spanish Town Road, the sprawling open-air shopping hub is also referred to as “Corrie” by locals, or sometimes “Duppy Market” because it shares real estate with an old graveyard that was once part of a now-disused railroad station. In 2014, more than 30 stalls were burned to the ground in a blaze that destroyed millions of Jamaican dollars worth of goods.\nSince then, vendors seem to have all but bounced back. The market, for all intents and purposes, is back to being a destination for tourists and locals alike. We visited early on a Monday morning, around 9am, to avoid the usual congestion and the heat of the midday sun. After winding through an endless number of stalls and side roads, I came away with a few of the better looking knockoffs I’ve seen in awhile.\nHere’s what I picked up: A faux pair of the recently released Nike x Supreme Air Force Ones and another Supreme fanny pack – they seem to be quite popular. I also discovered the newest Yeezy Boosts are already a hot commodity – several vendors were offering the 350 V2 in standard adidas colorways, and colors the company never made.\nThe total cost was about $98 (USD), plus an ice-cold Red Stripe, which I was prevailed upon to buy for a vendor who felt he’d given me too good of a bargain.\n“Supreme x Nike” Air Force Ones = JMD 5000 or about $39 \n“ Supreme ” Fanny Pack = JMD 2000 or about $16 \n“Yeezy Boost” 350 V2 = JMD 5500 or about $43 \nSee what went down at the annual Redemption Live Concert which celebrates Bob Marley’s legacy and birthday. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:18:14.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
