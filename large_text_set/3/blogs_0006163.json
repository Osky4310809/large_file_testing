I still must say my team has produced a huge effort tonight and played very well. \n“He is offside, Lewandowski, there is no penalty, on top of that he gives a yellow card, on top of that he gives after a red card. \n“It's just not serious. When you see the importance of the games and you see an attitude like that I am absolutely revolted and sorry for people who come and pay a lot of money to watch this kind of game.” \nWenger has now seen his side exit the Champions League at the first knockout stage in seven successive seasons. \nThose continental failings have contributed to the calls for him to step aside at the end of the season, but the long-serving manager believes there are positives to be taken. \nWATCH: Alexis laughs at drubbing \nHe added: “I felt we were in it. \n“You never know how Bayern would have reacted had we scored a second goal and at the end it finishes like that, it's difficult to take. And of course it looks very bad and doesn't reflect the quality of our performance tonight. \n“I think once it was 2-1 down it was very difficult. You have no chance to qualify any more. That's not the part of the game I would like to keep in my mind, because I think the second part of the game has been spoilt by the referee.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T02:46:01.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
