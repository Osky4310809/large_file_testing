Mings has denied that he intentionally stamped on the striker. \nBoth avoided red cards from referee Kevin Friend, with Ibrahimovic already in the book for dissent after the decision to award the penalty from which Bournemouth had levelled. \nA Football Association source has told ESPN FC that disciplinary chiefs will wait for Friend's match report before deciding whether to take any action against either Ibrahimovic or Mings. \nIbrahimovic told the BBC : \"Listen, what happens on the field stays on the field. Zlatan Ibrahimovic clashed with Tyrone Mings towards the end of the first half. \n\"I'm not someone who attacks someone off the field. \n\"You have the TV, you can see the images. I jump up and jump high and he jumps into my elbow.\" \nSpeaking on MTV he added: \"Hopefully he is not injured. \"These situations happen. I go for the ball and I am unlucky that he jumps into my elbow. Nothing on purpose.\" \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T18:41:22.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
