Credit to Can though – a less disciplined player might have turned around and given something back to Bradley, risking a red card. \nNow, the two sides must meet again for a replay next week to decide who advances in the FA Cup, and referees might want to be on high alert for armpit pinches and wet (or dry) willies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T10:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T06:07:15.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
