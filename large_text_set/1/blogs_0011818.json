LOUIS • A southern Missouri dog shelter is bringing its mission to the St. Louis area, opening an adoption center at the Chesterfield Mall. \nThe announcement comes weeks after financial strain caused the organization, Diana's Grove Dog Shelter, to send more than half of its 300 dogs to the Humane Society of Missouri. \nThe financial troubles stemmed from a severed relationship with an adoption partner in the St. Louis area. \nCynthea Jones, Diana's Grove founder and director, said the shelter was able to make its new digs — a 6,600-square-foot space on the lower level of the mall near Dillard’s — work thanks to nonprofit pricing from the mall and recent help from the community. \nThe shelter operates out of Cabool, Mo., a city in Texas County, though it has brought dogs to the St. Louis area for adoption every weekend for seven years. \nAccording to a shelter Facebook post , Diana's Grove signed a two-year lease with Chesterfield Mall for the space. The shelter plans to bring around 85 puppies and dogs each weekend for adoption, operating from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. each Sunday, starting Jan. 21. \nAshley Jost • 314-340-8169", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T23:22:42.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
