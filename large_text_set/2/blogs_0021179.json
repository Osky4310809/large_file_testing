Determination to do your best \nBorn in Jakarta, Sydney student Rizky Tri Rubbi, 24, learned to play cricket while at high school in Australia. \n\"Wherever I am, wherever I'm based now, I still love my country and there's just a difference between playing club and playing for your country,\" he said. \n\"You feel that determination that you want to do your best all the time and you don't want to let your country down. \n\"Cricket teaches you a lot of things, not just on the field but off the field as well. \n\"You have to be disciplined, you have to work hard to gain success just like in life — you can't get anything instantly.\" Having fun with team mates Photo: Law student Nalin Nipiko has travelled all over the world with cricket including to Europe and Africa. (ABC Central Victoria: Larissa Romensky) \n\"Cricket means a lot to me because of the travelling. You get to know other places in other countries,\" said Nalin Nipiko, 21, from Vanuatu. \n\"But the best thing about cricket is having fun with my team mates. I'm good friends with all of them.\" Cricket changing lives \n\"Cricket has changed my life. It has taken me to many foreign places,\" said Tsuyoshi Takada, 22, from Japan. \n\"Everyone is different and I have learned how to communicate with other players and to learn English.\" Representing mother's country \n\"It's what I love doing, it's what I've done all my life,\" said Philippines player Daniel Smith, 24. \n\"I can't just go through life and work and not do anything else with my weekends. \n\"Representing my mum's country, I know she is very proud and it's a really good feeling for me.\" Ricky Ponting fan \n\"I remember when I was small and watching it on the TV and watching Ricky Ponting and all those star players,\" said Sevoka Ravoka, 30, from Fiji. \n\"My role model is Ricky Ponting. \n\"I started playing when I was 17 and I have never looked back. I just love the game.\" Safer than rugby \n\"Rugby is the number one sport in Samoa but I don't like to play rugby. I love cricket,\" Samoan player Pritchard Pritchard, 27, said. \n\"I can travel around the world and it's a safe sport, you don't get lots of injuries.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:04:52.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
