According to Scary Mommy, the debate over getting rid of tampons has gotten really heated and there are a lot of differing opinions.\nIf you take a brief look into the very opinionated world of the Internet, you’ll find that any menstruating person who uses tampons regularly has their own belief — and they hold onto that belief very strongly. Let’s take a look at what some people are saying.\ndo people throw away tampons or flush them\n— kate weber (@kateclaire_) March 19, 2017 Serious question... if you don't flush a tampon down the toilet what do you do with it???? I've been flushing them!!! \n— lex☀️ (@l xyhill) March 6, 2017 imagine being a high schooler & thinking you could flush a tampon down the toilet \n— ㅤㅤㅤ (@voguerami) March 7, 2017 Lol if you don't flush your tampon go to hell\n— EcstaticYankeeFansGF (@LexieLoo_) February 21, 2017 Okay, so it sounds like people are pretty split when it comes to the disposal of a tampon . It gets even more confusing when you look at what companies like Kotex and Playtex say. For example, the first instruction Playtex gives to their tampon users is to flush the used tampon down the toilet. On the other hand, Kotex advises you “wrap it in some toilet paper (or put it in a bag) and place it in the bin or sanitary disposal unit.”\nWhat are we menstruating humans to do?!\nLucky for us, the Good Housekeeping Institute fired back with some answers. You might not love hearing this, but experts say that tampons are not supposed to be flushed down the toilet . In fact, you should keep your used tampons far away from the toilet bowl and instead dispose of them responsibly in the bin.\nBirnur Aral, Ph.D., Director of the Health, Beauty and Environmental Sciences Lab, told GoodHousekeeping.com that even though companies like Playtex and Kotex have differing opinions, it’s best not to flush your tampon at all.\n“One way or another, [tampons] all generate waste and burden the environment like anything else. Common sense tells me not to flush them,” Dr. Aral said. As gross as it might seem to those of us who are used to flushing tampons , we’d be much better off wrapping our bloody tampons in a little bit of toilet paper and safely tucking it away in the garbage can.\nIf you have pets or a small child running around the house, you might want to consider keeping them away from your bathroom bin. That’s an accident nobody deserves to clean up.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:49:24.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
