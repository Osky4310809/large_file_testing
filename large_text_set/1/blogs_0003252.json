Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nIt’s true that Donald Trump did wish a “Happy New Year” to all, including his “many enemies,” but maybe it’s just the timing that has Pulitzer Prize winner and New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman so sad and troubled. On New Year's Eve President-elect Trump actually called some fellow Americans his \"enemies.\" Really sad and troubling. \n— Thomas L.

Salazar (@LvlyWords) January 1, 2017 \nEither it’s the clear violation of the holiday spirit, or Friedman has simply forgotten or doesn’t care that Hillary Clinton, during a debate last October, told moderator Anderson Cooper that the enemy she was most proud to have made during her political career was Iran [crickets] … and the Republicans [cheers]. \nIn fact, her campaign thought the line was clever enough to tweet out. Chances are some Americans are also mixed up with some of her other notorious archenemies: the NRA, health insurance companies, and pharmaceutical companies. Hillary on the enemies she's proud to have made: \"The NRA, health insurance companies, drug companies, the Iranians…and the Republicans.\" \n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 14, 2015 @tomfriedman @RepScottHolcomb I'm old enough to remember Hillary Clinton saying Republicans were the enemies she's most proud of having. \n— Becca H (@LadyOnTheRight1) January 1, 2017 @tomfriedman That was @HillaryClinton 's plank. Where have you been? \n— DC Dude (@DCDude1776) January 1, 2017 \nNo hard feelings, though; the New York Times reported in June that once elected, President Clinton would employ her well known ability to “use alcohol as a political lubricant” to have relaxed, frank discussions with her enemies across the aisle. @tomfriedman Do you live under a rock? \n— Frank Styles (@DJFRANKSTYLES) January 1, 2017 @tomfriedman Hillary called all Republicans and half of America her enemy, troubling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T07:20:21.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
