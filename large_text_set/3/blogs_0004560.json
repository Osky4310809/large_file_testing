Then InHabit scans the content of every article from its publishing partners, and when it finds a good match, it plugs in a relevant factive. \nFor example, Arkadium has been testing InHabit with Sports Illustrated, so this article about the NFL draft includes a poll showing salary information for four wide receivers and asking “which WR delivered the most bang for the buck last season?” \nRovello noted that factives serve as templates where different teams, players and other data can be plugged in, so a single factive can have thousands of different variations depending on where it’s being embedded.

It can also turn off factives for certain subjects, say if a player gets embroiled in a particularly controversial or sensitive piece of news.\nIn beta testing, Arkadium says that 17 percent of users who saw a factive clicked on it. And among those users, session time increased 100 percent. \nThe initial set of factives is focused on sports, with finance on the way, and more topics after that. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:14:02.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
