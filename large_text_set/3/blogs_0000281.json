(Daniel Brenner, Special to the Denver Post) \nIf all the world’s a stage, this scene could have been written for the maximum tension the times seem to urge. \nCharacters: Black woman in her 30s. White cop in his 30s. \nSetting: a crossroads. \nInstead, it was like a scene in a bar — only better. A barista at Backstage Coffee approached a four-top and handed Nataki Garrett an almond milk chai. “That gentleman picked up the tab.” He pointed back to the counter at a young police officer, who smiled. \nGarrett smiled back. \nEarlier, the officer had been standing near the crossing of Curtis and 14th streets. Garrett was waiting for a walk signal. She didn’t really have to: 14 th was clear. And, let’s be honest, ours is a town of jaywalkers. But, said Garrett, “It just seemed disrespectful to cross with him right there.” \nDon’t mistake Garrett’s civic mindfulness for timidity. As the new associate artistic director at the Denver Center Theatre Company , she arrived in town with a dossier boasting a penchant for boldness. As the former associate dean and the co-head of the undergraduate acting program at CalArts School of Theater, Garrett had been hailed as an up-and-coming director, a champion of new work as well as a young but savvy arts administrator. \nShe’s a force of nurture, arriving at a time when local and regional theater is due for a fresh catalyst or two. Curious Theatre Company continues to push the envelope in terms of resonant drama. The Boulder theaters — the Boulder Ensemble Theatre Company and Local Theater Company in particular — are gaining artistic traction. Colorado Springs’ TheatreWorks is imagining an engaged way forward, even without the loving leadership of Murray Ross, who died in January. \nGiven its resources and history, the Denver Center for the Performing Arts — one of the largest not-for-profit theater organizations in the nation — rightly sees itself as integral to theater’s future. \nAny artistic transformation these days necessarily asks a boatload of essential — and American — questions: How does it broaden its sphere of engagement in terms of ethnicity and gender and economic circumstance? How does it reach millennials? How does the oldest of performative arts keep on keeping on in a visionary way? \nOne of the answers the theater company has embraced: new work. \n“The idea of the new thing coming to life has been part of my practice and my work for awhile,” Garrett said. “I wanted to go to an organization that focused on the writing, that did it on a large scale and that had a comparable budget (to CalArt’s program). \n“I feel like I have a skill for that, and I want to develop that skill. I felt this was a market I could learn in, and Kent (Thompson) was an artistic director I could learn from. And my husband (actor Kirkaldy Myers) and I had been ready to get out of L.A. for awhile. I’m attracted to change, so why not move to Denver?” \nGarrett was introduced to Thompson at last summer’s Theatre Communications Group confab in Washington, D.C., by Oregon Shakespeare Festival’s associate artistic director Christopher Acebo. \nBut it turns out that she will not be dancing with the one who brung her. In January, the Denver Center announced the resignation of Thompson, producing artistic director of the Denver Center Theatre Company. (Friday marks the end of Thompson’s 12-season tenure.) \nThere’s been public disagreement about the nature of Thompson’s departure. In early February, the Denver Center issued a statement rebutting a piece in Westword in which a former trustee stated Thompson had been pushed out. What seems clear is that Garrett has the support of Denver Center president and CEO Janice Sinden. \n“She’s a breath of fresh air. I think she’s a strong, visionary artist and director,” Sinden said on the phone a few days before the 12 th Colorado New Play Summit dived into its second weekend. “There are so many amazing things about her background, about her relationships across the country. I think she’s going to inspire us. I think she has a great eye for how we can engage new and different audiences at the DCPA as well. I’m beyond excited.” \nThompson was just as laudatory. “I think Nataki’s a remarkable director, which you haven’t seen yet. She’s incredibly articulate, committed, passionate. She has great insight into plays — new plays, old plays, whatever’s in production. I regret only that I’m not here longer to help her learn the ropes of running a theater. But I have no doubts that she can excel.” \nUnder Thompson’s leadership, two Denver Center mainstays were were born and have flourished: the Colorado New Play Summit and the Women’s Voice Fund. Both are decidedly in Garrett’s wheelhouse. \nThe playwrights Garrett has established relationships with as a director read like a Who’s Who of the brightest and boldest. Among them: MacArthur Fellow and Obie winner Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (“An Octoroon”); Katori Hall (“The Mountaintop”); Timberlake Wertenbaker (“Jefferson’s Garden”); and Sigrid Gilmer. \nThis from the latter’s website bio: “Sigrid Gilmer makes black comedies that are historically bent, totally perverse, joyfully irreverent and are concerned with issues of identity, pop culture and contemporary American society.” So there. \nAs a director, Garrett has already received a number of strong shout-outs from reviewers in Minneapolis, San Jose and Washington, D.C. It’s a boon for the Denver Center that she will continue to direct plays from time to time elsewhere. Just this week, Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre announced that Garrett will direct Aziza Barnes’“BLKS” during its 2017-2018 season. These gigs confirm her status and the Denver Center’s place in the national conversation about theater’s future. \n“It’s a fascinating comedic matrix that ‘An Octoroon’ constructs, enlivened by Jacobs­-Jenkins’ ear for absurdity and director Nataki Garrett’s sure-handed production,” wrote Peter Marks in his Washington Post review of Wooly Mammoth’s 2016 production of “An Octoroon.” In July, Garrett will direct a remount of the play at the D.C. theater. \n“Grippingly directed by Nataki Garrett,” stated a reviewer for the Bay Area’s Mercury News, writing about Ubuntu Theatre Project’s production last summer of Katori Hall’s “Hurt Village.” It was part of seven-month undertaking, during which the Oakland theater company opened a play in a new site each month. \nGarrett’s no stranger to theater’s outside-the-“black-box” thinking, which dovetails with the Denver Center’s new directions. Last spring, the Denver Center produced the site-specific performance piece “Sweet & Lucky,” in collaboration with New York’s Third Rail Projects. Later this month, the Denver Center — once again under the auspices of Off-Center and lead brainiac Charlie Miller — will partner with the local comedy troupe A.C.E. for a performance adventure at the Stanley Marketplace. \nStill, it’s tricky coming into an institution in flux. In addition to Thompson leaving, the Denver Center has seen the departures (for various reasons) of its fairly new CEO, Scott Shiller; theater company associate artistic director Bruce Sevy; and artistic producer Emily Tarquin. In addition to Garrett, Miller, who heads the Off-Center offerings, was named associate artistic director for strategy and innovation and Douglas Langworthy is now director of new play development and literary director. \n“My way of moving though any situation is to ask, ‘What’s my mandate?’,” Garrett said. “I’m not one to really believe that I’m here simply because of my talent or abilities or ambition. I’m the kind of the girl who waits for the marching orders. If this has to be done, then how can I be used?” \nThat assessment might prove overly humble, but it gets at something in Garrett’s leadership style. “I think Nataki is one of the finest young artists in the American theater. It’s unique to find someone of her caliber who is also an administrator and a leader,” said Travis Preston, dean of the CalArts School of Theater and artistic director of the CalArts Center for New Performance. \n“I think that she’s certainly an extraordinary director. That’s great, but she also has a vision for the future of theater in this country that can really contextualize how to move forward as an arts institution.” \nDuring the job interview gauntlet, Garrett met with a number of Denver Center creatives. Their questions about inclusion, about growing new audiences, about “parity” and “equity”— catchphrases in the national non-profit theater conversation — excited her. “I thought, ‘Oh, yeah, this is going to be my tribe.’ A theater of this size can — or cannot — decide to deal with equity and diversity and parity and it will still function fine. But if there’s a commitment within the organization to do that kind of work … Yeah, I want to go there,” she said. \n“I’ve watched theaters like Oregon Shakespeare Festival and the Guthrie (In Minneapolis) transform themselves and transform theater because of the work they’re doing. And if Denver wants to be part of that conversation, I want to be there when it happens.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T04:23:34.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
