But have you ever thought of drinking a beer made out of the delicate flowers? There’s a Japanese craft brew that’s fit to show you exactly what that tastes like, with Kanagawa Prefecture’s Sankt Gallen, who is releasing its Sankt Gallen Sakura craft beer as of today, February 23. The cherry blossom beer has returned to store shelves in Japan for its drinkers’ delights.\nIt’s a shame that the beer itself isn’t pink, but the bottle is adorned with a gorgeous label that evokes the season where Japan is positively full of the pale pink blossoms. And it’s sourced from the city of Ina in Nagano, where people famously go to view the flowers and the trees they fall from.\nvia .japantrends.com\nThe Sakura beer is brewed with wheat germ, which makes for a crisp-tasting beer that’s available in Japanese supermarkets and liquor stores for about 463 yen, or about $4. If you’re interested in trying it here since you’re probably not planning a trip to Japan anytime soon, you can order it directly from the brewery for a taste of Japan at home instead.\nThe cherry blossom beer will be available until early April, so while the blossoms are floating through the air in Japan, you can enjoy this beer at home or with friends right where you are. It’s just another part of the springtime wave of sweet treats and intriguing twists on the cherry blossom that inevitably fills Japan this time of the year, but can you blame them? Just look at the flower and smell that fragrant sweetness. There are plenty of other awesome treats out there too, but sadly many of them aren’t as easily attainable as this beer. If you do try it, make sure you let us know how it is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:00:44.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
