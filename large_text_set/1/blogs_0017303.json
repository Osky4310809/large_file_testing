In fact, we’ve called it the king of muscle-building exercises because you won’t find another move that builds as much total-body strength, muscle, and pure power at the same time. Not to mention that it’s practical as hell: Very few exercises will help you more in life than training your body to pick heavy shit up off the ground. (Why do you think movers are so jacked?) \nBut the deadlift takes some serious skill to pull off, since the exercise requires hundreds of your muscles to simultaneously work together, as well as full mobility in your ankles, hips, and upper back. Not everyone can do the deadlift safely and effectively, so we’re impressed with any workout warrior—man or woman—who can perform the move without getting hurt, screwing up their form, or begging for sweet mercy. \nCount the ladies on this list among those lifters. They’ve mastered the deadlift—or as some people affectionately call it, the “deathlift,”—to great effect, and have confidently posted their beastly leg-day workouts to Instagram using fierce tags like “ #girlswhodeadlift .” We’ll take pointers from these fit, sexy, and utterly badass women any day of the week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T04:18:37.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
