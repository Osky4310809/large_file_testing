While hardcore fans will always tune into the product, the big names do help sell the events to the more casual audience. \nSome say that WWE is missing that marquee star right now that will lead them into the next decade, as current top babyface John Cena won't be around forever. UFC's Chael Sonnen, who fights Tito Ortiz tonight at Bellator 170 and is involved with the upcoming new season of The Apprentice, feels the same way about WWE at the moment. In an interview with Channel Guide Magazine ( via SEScoops ), Sonnen said it's been that way for awhile now, and someone is going to have to throw caution to the wind in order to take their rightful place. \n“WWE has been hurting for stars for a while. They’ve done a really great job with what they have. Somebody needs to emerge though. Now is the perfect opportunity. I do feel like when I watch it that there are guys in the back who haven’t figured out the bureaucracy yet of how to break through. There is no clearer, more opportune of a time than right now. I’m just waiting for that guy to come forward and have their Steve Austin moment and grab control of this thing.” \nIt's going to take someone who's willing to bet on themselves according to Sonnen, saying “I haven’t seen anyone go into business for themselves. It’s going to take some courage. Somebody is going to have to do it. They are going to have to get a script one day and say, ‘That’s not right.’ They grab a microphone on live TV, put their job on the line and go for it. That’s how it works. It looks like creative has such control over these guys; they just don’t want to see that. But that is what it’s going to take. The time is right now. They are looking for a star, and the fans are looking for a guy they can truly get behind. Somebody needs to step up and do it.” \nMany have been critical of the micromanaging style that happens backstage these days, with every part of a promo poured over ad nauseum until all the spontaneity and personality is gone. If someone wants that ever elusive brass ring, they might have to take a leap of faith and just grab it for themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:19:28.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
