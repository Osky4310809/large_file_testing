A machine cutting slabs of coal inside Consol Energy's Bailey Mine in southwestern Pennsylvania. By Daniel Moore / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Email \nConsol Energy is planning to sell or spin-out its coal business as early as this year, the Cecil-based energy company announced this morning in a fourth-quarter earnings release. \nThe plan is another step in the company’s strategy to separate its coal business from its natural gas operations. Consol spun out some of its coal assets in 2015 to form CNX Coal Resources. \n“We think there may be a market opportunity to achieve a sale of the coal business on favorable terms or, alternatively, to effect a spin-off as our leverage ratio comes down to a level that allows each business to stand on its own,” said David M. Khani, Consol’s chief financial officer, in a statement. \nMeanwhile, Consol reported a fourth-quarter loss of $306 million, or $1.33 a share, down from a profit of $34. 3 million, or 13 cents per share, during the year-ago quarter. \nFor the full year, the company lost $848 million, or $3.70 a share, compared with a loss of $374.9 million in 2015. \nDuring the fourth quarter, the average sales prices that Consol got for its natural gas improved to $2.22 per thousand cubic feet, up from $1.83 per thousand cubic feet a year ago. \nThe company will discuss earnings with investors and analysts during a 10 a.m. conference call. \nDaniel Moore: dmoore@post-gazette.com, 412-263-2743 and Twitter @PGdanielmoore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:50:51.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
