I left the hospital looking 5 months pregnant. Many people think a woman should shrink right back to her pre-birth weight immediately. That is just not the truth for most. The female body is incredible and resilient, but healing and strengthening take time. Now it's time for patience and hard work. Lots of love to all the new mamas out there on the journey. üí™üèºüí™üèº #yesihaveascrunchieinmyhair #shaiiswortheverypound\nPreach, girl, PREACH!!!\nShe looks AH-Mazing in her post-baby body, five-month pregnant look be damned! And she should conform to no one BUT the best moves she personally needs to make for her own health! Amen!!!\n[ Image via Peta Murgatroyd/ Instagram . ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T04:42:09.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
