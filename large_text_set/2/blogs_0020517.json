Hüseyin and his family had recently moved from their war-torn home Syria and came Kilis, Turkey as refugees. Despite the terrible events that occurred in his own young life, this brave little boy did whatever he could to ease the suffering of an animal who needed his help. Unfortunately, the dog did not survive her injuries and was pronounced dead at a veterinarian’s office. The local government took notice of what Hüseyin did and rewarded him with due recognition. The deputy-mayor Cuma Özdemir also visited the boys home bringing food, clothing and a new blanket to replace the one he that he so willingly gave to the dog. \n(translated) We wanted to visit Hussein for his grand gesture, which may seem like a small and simple affair to some people, but he has done a great deal of work for humanity. It touched us that he gave his own blanket to the while experiencing his own heating problem. There is an understanding that our nation will not be a one of oppression. It may be a man, an animal, or a different creature. Hüseyin also showed such inherent compassion, which did not go unnoticed and visited him. While not as meaningful as what he did for the dog, we gave him a blanket.\n\n\nvia AA , Haberturk , The Dodo \nRelated Laughing Squid Posts 9-Year Old Boy (With Help From His Dad) Opens A No-Kill Animal Shelter In His Garage A Sweet Dog Who Lost His Front Paws to a Vicious Attack Is Able to Walk Again With Prosthetics Stray Elderly Blind Dog and His Seeing Eye Dog Are Inseparable Best Friends Who Need a Loving Home Together ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:11:53.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
