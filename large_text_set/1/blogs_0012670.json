Anthony Alford is grateful to teammates and all of Toronto for the support he's gotten. ( Rick Madonik / Toronto Star ) | Order this photo By Richard Griffin Baseball Columnist Fri., Jan. 13, 2017 Sometimes we forget, but professional athletes, though often placed on a societal pedestal and perceived as immortals from Olympus, can see the same disasters and personal crises befall them as the rest of the mere mortals. In the early morning hours on Dec. 28, Blue Jays outfield prospect Anthony Alford received a panicky call from his little sister, Ayanna. The 16-year-old had awoken to a popping sound and rushed into the main house only to discover that the family home in Columbia, Miss., where she lived with their parents, was ablaze. They all escaped unharmed. By the time Anthony, 22, had driven the 30 minutes down Highway 44 from Sumrall — also the hometown of NFL great Brett Favre — the fire was out of control. In the days after the blaze that destroyed all of his childhood memorabilia and all of his parents’ possessions, an online fundraising campaign was set up. It has raised more than $14,000 toward rebuilding. “It’s going really well, thanks to the support in the community, thanks to guys like (Blue Jays) Kevin Pillar, Devon Travis, our front office,” Alford said. “They’ve been a really good support group for me and my family. Thanks to the people here in the city of Toronto. They got behind and helped donate and really reached out to encourage us as a family to just keep pushing.” Article Continued Below Amazingly, this is not the first time disaster has affected Alford’s family at home in Mississippi. Days before Christmas in 2014, a series of devastating tornadoes ripped through rural Mississippi and destroyed the home of his grandmother, where he grew up and spent much of his childhood. “It was a house that had a lot of memories,” Alford recalled. “It was devastating, the fact that we grew up in the house pretty much. We spent a lot of time there and it’s gone.” Alford’s future as a major-league player is bright. Prior to the 2012 draft, Alford and Tampa Bay Buccaneerss quarterback Jameis Winston were considered the best two-sport high school prospects — baseball and football. Winston is on his way to NFL all-pro status. Alford signed with the Jays after they allowed him to continue with college football. After a failed season as starting quarterback at Southern Miss and a season as a defensive back at Mississippi, he chose baseball. He has had some catching up to do because of the early attention to football and has suffered other setbacks through injury, but is still the No. 3-ranked prospect in the Jays’ organization. His third major-league spring training is approaching. He views that as a blessing. “I’m very fortunate,” a humble Alford offered as the Jays’ rookie week at the Rogers Centre wound down on Thursday. “It’s been a big learning experience for me, because growing up you’re always ‘the man’ on the team, or you’re always the top player on the team. Then you get to big-league camp, it’s kind of humbling. But at the same time you can either waste that opportunity or take advantage of it. I try to take advantage and be a student of the game every time I get that opportunity.” In the back of his mind there’s a plan for when he has financial security as a major-leaguer. “As far as moving the family, the tornado and the fire, hopefully one day I’m put in the position where I can help my family get a new house,” he added. The first workout for Jays pitchers and catchers is Feb. 14 in Dunedin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:31:26.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
