After the thrills and spills of Red Monday, now it’s time for Red ... Sunday. As the Premier League hype machine cranks into gear once more for a match between fourth and sixth and everyone tries to stay awake while remember anything interesting that happened when Manchester United and Liverpool met at Anfield in October, it might be worth cooling your expectations for this one, if only for the sake of poor old perspective, which tends to take a fearsome beating before a Big Match. It is only one game. There have been plenty in the past, there have been plenty in the future and the last one between these two sides lives long in the memory only for its sheer awfulness, machiavellian master of mind games Jose Mourinho setting United up negatively, Liverpool unable to summon the wit to find a way through. \nAlternatively, of course, we can ignore reality, dream a little and embrace the hype because this is, at the end of the day, for me, y’know, when all’s said and done, a hugely significant game for a number of reasons. The most important one is that supporters of the winning team will get to crow on social media for at least a week. Unleash the memes! Drown them with gifs! Kill them with banter! But trying to predict the outcome isn’t easy. Although Liverpool would have been favourites a month or two ago and the narrative has swung United’s away over the festive period, these are two evenly matched teams, with two excellent managers, plenty of matchwinners and a fair few weaknesses on both sides. \nFrom United’s perspective, this is a fine opportunity to answer suggestions the critics who have played down their nine-match winning run because of the quality of their opponents, while Liverpool need to get back on track after disappointing league and cup results against Sunderland, Plymouth and Southampton. It will certainly be interesting to see how Mourinho approaches the challenge of taking on Jurgen Klopp’s freewheeling side. He can be one of the more ... how to put this nicely ... pragmatic managers around, but United have the attacking players to test Liverpool’s nerve and occasionally questionable defending. United were passive against Manchester City in September and paid for it, but this is no time to play for a point given that they would go two behind Liverpool. Don’t underestimate Klopp’s men, though. They might be without Sadio Mane and they have injury concerns over important players, but just check them out in big games this season – they’ve already stylishly seen off Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City this season, so they are unlikely to show any fear here. In summary, then, believe the hype. Believe it! It’s Manchester United! It’s Liverpool! It’s gonna be massive! \nKick-off: 4pm GMT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T17:26:33.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
