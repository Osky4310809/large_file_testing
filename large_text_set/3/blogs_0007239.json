Every day, via every channel, you — our readers, subscribers, community members, and social followers — would ask us really good questions. (You're an incredibly intelligent, friendly, inquisitive bunch, you know that? It's humbling.) A lot of those questions were about how to accomplish your SEO goals, and it got us thinking. \nMoz is an educational resource, it's true, but we also offer a suite of tools (both free and paid) that can help you achieve those goals. Why not provide a space for those two things to converge? And thus, the idea of the Daily SEO Fix was born: quick 1–3 minute videos shared throughout the week that feature Mozzers describing how to solve problems using the tools we know best. \nIt's two years later now, and both our tools and our industry have evolved. Time to revisit this idea, no? \nToday's series of Daily SEO Fixes feature our keyword research tool, Keyword Explorer . Perhaps you've heard us mention it a couple times — we sure like it, and we think it could help you, too. And you don't have to be a subscriber to check this puppy out — anyone on the whole wide Internet can use it to research two queries a day for free. If you're logged into your Moz community account , you get five free queries. \nOpen Keyword Explorer in a new tab! \nQueue it up in another browser tab to follow along, if you'd like!* \n*Keep in mind that some features, such as lists, are only available when you're also a Moz Pro Medium subscriber or above. If you're bursting with curiosity, you can always check out the 30-day free trial , which features everything you'd see in a paid subscription... but for free. :)\n\nFix #1: Nitty-gritty keyword research Let's get down to brass tacks: your keyword research. Janisha's here to walk you through... \nResearching your keyword; Determining whether it strikes the right balance of volume, difficulty, and opportunity; How to quickly analyze the SERPs for your query and see what factors could be affecting your ranking opportunity; Finding keyword suggestions ripe with promise; and Organizing your newly discovered keywords into lists. Fix #2: Finding question keywords to boost your content & win featured snippets When you answer the questions searchers are actually asking, you've got way more opportunity to rank, earn qualified traffic to your site, and even win yourself a featured snippet or two. Brittani shows you how to broaden your page content by speaking to your audience's most burning questions.\n\nFix #3: Updating your keyword metrics on a whim If you're hot on the trail of a good ranking, you don't have the time or patience to wait for your metrics to update on their own. Kristina shows you how to get that sweet, sweet, up-to-date data after you've organized a list of related keywords in Keyword Explorer. \n\nFix #4: Moving curated keyword lists to Moz Pro for long-term tracking If you're interested in tracking the overall SEO progress of a site and digging into the nuts and bolts of your keyword data, you'll want to pay attention. Kristina's back to explain how to import your curated Keyword Explorer lists into a Moz Pro campaign to track long-term rankings for a specific site. \n\nThat's a wrap for Week 1! There you have it — four ways to level up your keyword research and knock some to-dos off your list. We'll be back next Thursday with more fixes from a new group of Mozzers; keep an eye on our social channels for a sneak peek, and maybe try a free spin of Moz Pro if you'd like to follow along. \nCurious about what else you can do with Keyword Explorer?
