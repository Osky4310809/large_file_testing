Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption There are calls to introduce Vitamin D directly into food \nTrials on using supplements to prevent infections have given mixed results, so the researchers pooled data on 11,321 people from 25 separate trials to try to get a definitive answer. \nThe team at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) looked at respiratory tract infections - which covers a wide range of illnesses from a sniffle to flu to pneumonia. \nOverall, the study said one person would be spared infection for every 33 taking vitamin D supplements. \nThat is more effective than flu vaccination, which needs to treat 40 to prevent one case, although flu is far more serious than the common cold. \nThere were greater benefits for those taking pills daily or weekly - rather than in monthly super-doses - and in people who were deficient in the first place. \nOne of the researchers, Prof Adrian Martineau, said: \"Assuming a UK population of 65 million, and that 70% have at least one acute respiratory infection each year, then daily or weekly vitamin D supplements will mean 3.25 million fewer people would get at least one acute respiratory infection a year.\" \nPHE already advises everyone to take vitamin D supplements in autumn and winter for the sake of healthy bones and muscles. \nThey are recommended all year round for some people who get little sunlight on their skin, including people in care homes or those who cover up. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Vitamin D is made naturally by people's bodies - if they get plenty of sunlight \nHowever, there is considerable debate about the importance of the latest study. \nProf Louis Levy, the head of nutrition science at PHE, said: \"The evidence on vitamin D and infection is inconsistent and this study does not provide sufficient evidence to support recommending vitamin D for reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections.\" \nBut Prof Martin Hewison, from the University of Birmingham and the Society for Endocrinology, said the findings were \"striking\". \n\"I agree with the authors that this study supports a new indication for vitamin D beyond its established benefits for bone health,\" he added. \nAnd the research wing of the NHS, the National Institute for Health Research which funded the study, said the findings were \"worthy of serious further debate\". \nUltimately, the researcher team at QMUL want vitamin D to be added to food like in the US where milk is fortified. \nProf Martineau said: \"Vitamin D fortification of foods provides a steady, low-level intake of vitamin D that has virtually eliminated profound vitamin D deficiency in several countries. \n\"By demonstrating this new benefit of vitamin D, our study strengthens the case for introducing food fortification to improve vitamin D levels in countries such as the UK where profound vitamin D deficiency is common.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:48:20.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
