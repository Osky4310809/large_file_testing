Doctors say Becca has between three months and a year to live. \nAnne Schofield, seen here with Becca at the 2015 Tree of Hope on CBC’s Information Morning Moncton, said her family will spend Becca’s remaining time together. (Karin Reid-LeBlanc/CBC) \n“We are crushed beyond imagination that our beautiful strong superhero will not win her battle with this horrible disease,” her mother, Anne Schofield, wrote on her GoFundMe campaign page. \n“[Becca] is writing a bucket list and we plan to help her fill as many wishes as we can.” \nAlready on the list is Becca’s goal of creating “a mass act of kindness.” \n“It can be as big or as small as you’d like,” Becca said on Twitter. “Donate to charity, volunteer your time, or even just do the dishes without your parents asking. \n“Do something to make someone smile and then tweet what you did under the hashtag #BeccaToldMeTo.” \nShe hopes the hashtag will trend worldwide. \nHundreds of people are already posting about their good deeds in honor of Schofield, and Riverview Coun. Tammy Rampersaud calls Becca “our own personal Santa.” \n“I think inside of each one of us we want to do good … so people are doing small things for others, and they’re doing big things all in Becca’s name and it’s beautiful.” 2 \nIn true Canadian Fashion thousands of Tim Horton Coffees have been RAK’d 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:08:05.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
