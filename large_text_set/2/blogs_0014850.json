No such thing as a hard tag. As many blokes on the bench as there are running around the park and a stack of heavy artillery sitting on the sidelines drinking protein shakes. \nRookies, though — they get my blood up right from the outset. \nAnd a few put their hand up for Round 1 berth over the weekend. \nHere are the five kids that impressed me most during weekend No. 1 of the JLT Community Series. \nED VICKERS-WILLIS (North Melbourne) \nPrice: $123,900 \nPosition: Defender \nWeek 1 stats: 88 SuperCoach points, 19 disposals at 85% efficiency, 9 intercepts, 4 rebound 50s, 86% time on ground \nCOMPOSED in defence, this kid knows exactly when to stick and when to move off his man. \nHe will compete with Marley Williams and Mitch Hibberd for the same spot in North’s back half for mine. Based on what I saw on Sunday, it’s his spot to lose. \nSnagged by North at Pick 36 in the 2014 draft, he now looks set for a genuine crack at the best 22. North Melbourne’s Ed Vickers-Willis had nine intercepts against Sydney.

Nic Newman (78 SuperCoach points), Oliver Florent (46) and Jordy Foote (81) will also jostle for prime sucking position at Longmire’s bosom of rookie accommodation leading into Round 1. \nAARON BLACK (Geelong) \nPrice: $137,100 \nPosition: Forward \nWeek 1 stats: 89 SuperCoach points, 13 disposals at 62% efficiency, 4 goals, 81% time on ground \nSNAGGED four majors and looked a glistening bull. \nPut it in the book, he’ll sit alongside Cambridge Tom Hawkins and Harry Taylor in a three-pronged Geelong forward line round 1. \nKicked 25 goals for North in 2014 before falling out of favour, purpose-traded by Geelong and has a role to play. \nWhack him in. Jock says Brisbane’s Hugh McCluggage is the only high-priced rookie you should consider at this stage. Picture: Liam Kidston Source: News Corp Australia \nHUGH MCLUGGAGE (Brisbane Lions) \nPrice: $202,800 \nPosition: Midfield/Forward \nWeek 1 stats: 67 SuperCoach points, 14 disposals at 71% efficiency, 8 contested possessions, 65% time on ground \nMARK my words: These high draft picks rarely justify their bloated starting price. \nThey’ll rarely cough up many more points per game than your reasonably-priced cheaper rookie and they’ll generate your mob a hell of a lot less cash come trade time. This is unpacked to within an inch of its life in the 2017 Jock Reynolds SuperCoach Magazine . \nBut McCluggage is the only high-priced kid worth half a SuperCoach 2017 crumpet in my book. \nA proven SC pointscoring pig at TAC Cup level, he looked the part in the game time he was provided against the Suns. \nAnd unlike your Andy McGraths, your Tim Tarantos or your Will Brodies — McCluggage has rock-solid job security in an ordinary Brisbane outfit. \nTOM STEWART (Geelong) \nPrice: $117,300 \nPosition: Defender \nWeek 1 stats: 85 SuperCoach points, 16 disposals at 56% efficiency, 8 marks, 6 tackles, 5 intercepts, 84% time on ground \nTHE 23-year-old local lad was taken at Pick 40 in the 2016 national draft after starring in the VFL for Geelong. \nAn intercept marking specialist, he hurts them on the rebound — and he showed more than enough against the Hawks on Friday night. \nHarry Taylor looks like playing up near the sticks and while Andrew Mackie’s tooth length is becoming an issue. \nThey love Tommy down the Cattery and there’s a key defensive spot with his name on it in. \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.
