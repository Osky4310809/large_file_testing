With cold air in place, particularly west and north of the Baltimore area, snow, which may be heavy is expected to develop by later Monday night into Tuesday.” \nMany questions still have to be resolved with regards to the exact storm location and the available moisture and milder air from the Atlantic and the bay. \nThere will likely be a very sharp division between snow and a mix of rain and snow by Tuesday. We will send updated forecasts over the next few days as details become more accurate. \nPlease stay tuned and watch WJZ at 11 and all weekend for updated forecasts. \nThis story is being updated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T11:09:34.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
