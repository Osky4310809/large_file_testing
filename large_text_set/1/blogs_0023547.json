As the title of the new campaign suggests, the photos show off the low-light prowess of the iPhone 7’s 12MP f/1.8 shooter. \nApple took the help of photographers from around the world who travelled to Arctic ice caves, Indonesian volcanos, and rooftops of Shanghai to capture people, sights, and scenes they came across during the night using the iPhone 7. The photos will now be displayed by Apple in 25 countries starting from today. Chicago-based photographer Reuben Wu ventured to Java, Indonesia to photograph the 130 active volcanoes, using an iPhone 7 attached to a drone to capture breathtaking views of Gunung Karang’s lava flow after dark. Ruairidh McGlynn traveled to Iceland to photograph the foreboding terrain of the Arctic, traveling overnight by dog sled. The photos captured by the iPhone 7 truly are breathtaking and really show off what its 12MP shooter is capable of. However, do remember that the photos have been taken by a professional, and a camera is always as good as a person who uses it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T19:18:46.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
