What better way to start the year? But I don't do just any fast. For 21 days every January, I do the Daniel Fast, which encourages you to eat mostly fruits, vegetables and nuts. No meat! The fast that I was introduced to in my old church allowed fish for the sake of having a consistent protein. I eat some every few days and focus on quinoa bases, soups, salads, baked and roasted plantains the other days.
