It also has almost 300K on the clock, which is not so good. Let’s see if its price tag balances out those two extremes.\nAdvertisement \n\nIf you’re an Angeleno, then you’re most likely familiar with Angelyne , the pink Corvette-driving self-proclaimed and self promoting sex-kitten singer who prowls the town. You’d also know that these days Angelyne is well past her prime for the kitschy persona she puts forth.\nThat seeming was also the case for yesterday’s 1980 Volkswagen Scirocco which was oh so nice but perhaps caught in that limbo land between classic and just plain out of tune with the times owing to its lack of modern safety and performance. It’s price didn’t do it any favors either, and in the end the combination dropped the elderly VW in a 62% Crack Pipe loss. Too bad, so sad.\n\nHere we have another coupe, albeit one that’s far more modern—actually hailing from this century—and featuring such modernities as in-dash navigation and a six-speed stick. Those features must have made the car a real joy to drive because someone has put a healthy 278,000 miles worth of use on this 2003 Acura CL to enjoy them.\nAdvertisement \n\nThe CL was introduced in 1997 and is notable for being the first Acura-branded model to be built in Honda’s Marysville Ohio plant. A mid-sized coupé, the CL is based on the Honda Accord platform and initially offered both four and six cylinder motivation.\n\nThis one is a second generation car which only came with one engine option in the U.S.—that being Honda’s 3.2-litre V6. In standard dress that engine pumped out 225-bhp. This being the performance edged Type S, it called to arms a total of 260 ponies. Further, this being an ’03 it also comes with the somewhat rare but more desirable (the CL automatics have a rep for failures) six-speed manual.\n\nThe car looks to be in pretty nice shape for its monumental mileage, and as you might expect, not all of the components on the car have been along for the entire ride. The ad notes that the current owner has added the last 100K to the count, and over the course of his ownership the car has seen a new timing belt at 192K, a clutch and flywheel at that same time, struts and control arms at 222K, and plugs just 4K ago. Maintenance is said to have been well-documented, and the car is claimed to “run great.”\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:42:02.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
