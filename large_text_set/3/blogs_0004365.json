(Photo: Rick Rowell, ABC) \nSit down, take your tops off, and let‚Äôs talk about this episode of The Bachelor . \nAt this awkward stage of the season, Chris Harrison explains to the women that there are simply too many of them for Nick to see them all, so they‚Äôll have to make the most of the limited time they‚Äôre given, and boy howdy do they. \nThe night is broken into a wedding photo shoot that launched at least a dozen kisses, a touching one on a date with Danielle M, and a half dozen fake breakups that led to one real break up. \nIn honor of this week‚Äôs bridal photo shoot date, let‚Äôs give out some wedding superlatives. Something old \nIn the night‚Äôs most touching moment, Danielle M takes the opportunity of getting the first one-on-one date to get personal with Nick. After a helicopter ride (drink!), boat champagne toast (keep drinking!), and patio dinner (finish your drink!), Danielle reveals that she was once engaged, but her fianc√© died of an overdose. The moment brings them closer and in turn, ensures she‚Äôll have at least one more week to get to know Nick. Something new \nTaking a break from the makeout power hour that was group date number one, Raven breaks through the pack to have an actual conversation with Nick that reveals she‚Äôs not only charmingly hilarious, but pretty genuine to boot. Me, watching Raven have an actual conversation with Nick. #TheBachelor pic.twitter.com/Xd8DC17ZKw ‚Äî Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) January 10, 2017 Something topless \nNever one to be outdone, Corrine follows up Brittany and Nick‚Äôs Adam and Eve photo shoot by simply ripping off her bikini top in the pool for her own topless wedding shots. She wins the photo shoot competition, but that was also judged by a man named Franco wearing what appears to be a tropical-patterned romper, so take it at face value. The whole date does earn girlfriend a rose though, so there‚Äôs that. <!--iframe--> Something rude \nMajor props to Worst BFF Ever Christen who starts the episode as Liz‚Äôs confidant, only to reveal her history with Nick on the group date. Granted, Liz was doing little to nothing to keep her previous affair a secret, but Christen rode that reveal to the rose ceremony like a PRO. Christen is all of us right now! üò≥ #TheBachelor pic.twitter.com/YZfQ2aV09U ‚Äî The Bachelor (@BachelorABC) January 10, 2017 \nAnd now for the weekly trifecta: The good \nHate her, love her, share a hot dog with her, Josephine vindicated every Bachelor fan‚Äôs frustration with Nick with one swift slap. Tasked with ‚Äúbreaking up with each other,‚Äù Josephine opens with a five-finger goodbye and effectively resets our relationship with Nick. We have to let it go now. We have to let him live. Josephine vindicated three years of #TheBachelor for all of us. pic.twitter.com/uG2cqELNIu ‚Äî Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) January 10, 2017 The bad \nAre you ok? I‚Äôm ok. Are we all ok? Notwithstanding Boobgate, Corinne makes it her mission to interrupt almost every contestant‚Äôs alone time until Taylor puts an end to it by taking back her precious few minutes with Nick, which results in the most painful body language exchange since Claire‚Äôs finger pointing at Juan Pablo. <!--iframe--> The Viall \nWorst Secret Keeper 2017, Liz, opens up and lets Christen in on her adult sleepover with Nick, which almost immediately backfires. If Nick didn‚Äôt already have his doubts about Liz, her indiscretion is enough to let her go. But in the wake of Liz‚Äôs departure, Nick decides he must tell the women about his and Liz‚Äôs past, and it seems the women don‚Äôt take it well. <!--iframe--> \nRemember that you don‚Äôt have to take your top off to be loved ‚Äî we have each other. Catch The Bachelor next Monday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC to see how the women respond to the news about Liz and Nick‚Äôs romp around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:56:23.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
