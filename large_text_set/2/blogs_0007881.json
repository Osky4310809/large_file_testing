This time, Cahill stopped to talk with Chelsea TV, which you can watch over on the official Chelsea website . A draw at Burnley sounds pretty disappointing on the face of it, but considering the Clarets’ bizarrely excellent home form, it could be looked as a decent result, especially as it still increased Chelsea’s lead at the top of the league for at least 24 hours until Manchester City play their match-in-hand Monday night at Bournemouth. Either way, the one point earned could yet prove an important one in the final reckoning. “You could see it from the minute we walked out: freezing cold, snowing, pitch was average ... you knew you were in for a tough game.” “It’s important that we didn’t lose the game, that’s for sure [...] sometimes you have to dig in and get a point in places like this and maybe it is an important point, so we’ll see.” That’s not to say that Chelsea played well or that we’re using the conditions or Burnley’s tactics as an excuse. Chelsea played into Sean Dyche’s gameplan for large parts of the second half and that was certainly disappointing as we know the team are capable of much more. Cahill agrees. “Conditions and everything else aside ... it’s no excuse, we know we can play better than that.” With Spurs losing at Anfield on Saturday, Chelsea actually extended our lead in the league to 10 points, though that’s likely to be down to 8 points after tomorrow’s game unless Bournemouth manage to take points off City. Guardiola’s side are once again resurgent and could possibly pose a danger further down the road, though 8 points is still a very generous cushion for Chelsea to have heading into the final 13 games of the season. “The mentality is to keep going, keep the foot down, keep working, keep trying to win games, and chalk them off one by one. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel, in a way.” “[But this game] is a reminder today that it’s not going to be easy to cross the line, so we have keep focused, keep working. There’s a huge reward at the end if we manage to do so; there should be no more motivation needed than that.” -Gary Cahill Next weekend is an FA Cup weekend, which implies rotation, so the Chelsea starters have two weeks to refocus, get healthy and well rested for Swansea’s visit to the Bridge and get immediately back to winning ways.
