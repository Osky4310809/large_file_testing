Got something on your mind? Email the Funbag . Today, we’re covering adulthood, white chocolate, gum, sex, and more.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nYour letters:\nPaul:\nAdvertisement \n\nDo you think Hitler ever ate a taco?\nNo. Hitler lived well before the globalization of food, and a cursory Google search indicates that he probably never visited any countries outside of Europe. Maybe if he had been compelled to make some diplomatic trip to Mexico, he would have been confronted with a taco at a fancy state dinner. And then the host would say, “Señor Hitler, we have prepared a traditional Mexican favorite for you.” And then Hitler would be like, “Ja ja, das gut!” and try to look like he’s honored to be served a taco, but failing because he’s Hitler and he always looks super pissed about everything.\nBut we have no record of such a dinner ever occurring. It’s possible that Hitler never even HEARD of tacos. Not once. Think about it: When would it come up? It’s not like he was surrounded by foodies. Goebbels never interrupted his war planning to be like, “You know, I found this AMAZING hole in the wall where we can grab a bite to eat after wiping out Poland.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:45:48.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
