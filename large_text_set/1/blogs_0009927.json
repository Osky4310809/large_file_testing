As we‚Äôve all gotten accustomed to doing this, there are definite stages of online celebrity grief‚Ä¶ 1. Letting Everyone Know \n‚Äî WRETCHED COMEDIAN (@oldmanweldon) January 2, 2017 \nYou need to be on top of this; everyone online must know how deeply, and personally, you were affected by the death of said celebrity. Tie your entire sense of self into this one person‚Äôs work. Remember, everyone must know that you are devastated. 2. Researching Celebrity‚Äôs Body Of Work As a Script Doctor, Carrie Fisher rewrote and polished the scripts for LETHAL WEAPON 3, OUTBREAK, HOOK, THE WEDDING SINGER and many more. pic.twitter.com/S6FIPC91bU \n‚Äî TIFF (@TIFF_NET) December 27, 2016 \nYou don‚Äôt want to come off like a fraud who only knows the hits; you want to get into the deep cuts of the departed‚Äôs past. In fact, don‚Äôt even reference the work the celebrity is most famous for, and if you do, only in the context of making clear that you don't know the departed from that famous work like the rest of the Twitter rubes. Really establish yourself as an expert in this thing that might end up being a mistake on the celebrity‚Äôs Wikipedia page. 3. Reading Everyone Else‚Äôs Grief Posts George Michael is an important LGBT figure. The embarrassment of how he was outed to the public and how he handled it needs to be applauded. \nLol look at all of these fakers; you are winning with your much more popular-online posts. 4. Mocking Everyone Else For Their Posts Man people are going to be amazed when they find out celebrities will also die in 2017 \n‚Äî Captain Antagonist (@AnOrangeSNES) December 28, 2016 \nGod, what is everyone even so upset about? They didn‚Äôt even know this person, why are they acting like a family member died? I bet they only knew the departed from whatever they were most popular for, anyway. 5. Actually Letting It Settle In I went thru two relationships, lost David Bowie and Carrie Fisher, and yet I still miss you the most - Harambe \n‚Äî tommy chong üêô (@TomTomTheKat) December 30, 2016 \nNow that you think about it, it is weird that (CELEBRITY) is gone. Sure, you weren‚Äôt intimately familiar with everything they‚Äôd done, but you really liked that essay they wrote in the New Yorker, and you really related to them talking about their struggles with addiction/depression/abuse/etc. on a talk show recently. They weren‚Äôt even that old... it‚Äôs just surprising, is all. 6. Actually Revisiting Their Work If you've never read Carrie Fisher's Postcards from the Edge, you're missing something great. The movie's good; the book is better. \n‚Äî Scott Weinberg (@scottEweinberg) December 23, 2016 \nMan, that book they wrote was good! And that movie they wrote, while not perfect, clearly had a big influence on a lot of young filmmakers to come. Plus, did you see the paintings they did in the '90s? They‚Äôre actually good! That, like, never happens with celebrities. 7. Wondering Who Will Be Next Now that Carrie Fisher is safe, let's move on to other important things like dismantling Jesse Eisenberg's career \n‚Äî Abe Johnson (@TheAbeJohnson) December 24, 2016 \nMy God, so many famous people are incredibly important to you; who will be your next great loss?!?! \nEveryone be safe. I love you all (publicly, on the internet, in as performative a way as possible).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T08:23:26.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
