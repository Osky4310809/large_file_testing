There might be tears; it could get ugly.\nThen, finally, once the dust is settled, one of you will say that poison phrase: ‘We can still be friends though?’\nThe part of you that wants to come across as a polite, reasonable and mature human being will probably think ‘yeah why not’.\nThey were an important part of your life, so why would you want to cut them out altogether?\n\nYou’ve seen it work for other people , why shouldn’t it work for you?\nI’m sorry, but no. And you don’t have to.\nYou can just cut them out then and there if you want.\nIt doesn’t make you seem psycho or crazy to want that – in fact, some research suggests it’s the people who remain friends with their exes that have psychopathic traits.\nJust saying.\nMore These wedding horror stories will spur you to double check your guest list \nThe average Brit is having sex in less time than it takes to boil an egg \nDurian flavoured Kit Kats could soon be a thing \nRemembering Rajan, the iconic swimming elephant \nIn many cases, that might be the honest to god best thing you can do for yourself.\nI know this because I’ve tried. I tried so hard to be friends with my exes when I was younger, to try to appear like a reasonable person, and it was awful. \nThose who read my piece about why you shouldn’t settle will be familiar with my university boyfriend. \nThe one I thought was ‘The One’, but who wasn’t in the end. \nSometimes just too much has happened (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) I chose to throw myself into my job and life in London, and that’s been great. \nIt was the best decision I could have made. \nBut you know what I ended up regretting the most? The question I asked myself repeatedly? \nWhy didn’t I cut him out the moment we said it was over? Why did I agree to be just friends? Why, oh why.\nI wonder if I could have saved myself from trying to pick myself and my broken confidence up from the floor a year after our final goodbye if I’d just blocked him on Facebook and deleted his number when we first broke up. \nInstead, I tried to be ‘mature’ about it. \nYou live and learn, I suppose.\nYou get more bed space too I guess (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk) Sometimes, there are circumstances where being friends is what you need to do. \nI have dated people in the same friendship group, or who now work in the same building as me (after we were over. Awks). \nSo with them, we’ve had to somewhat navigate a friendship, because it was the right thing to do, even if there were hurt feelings involved. \nWhile it’s all fine and I can say we all benefit from being friends now, I can’t deny that it’s been uncomfortable at times and there has been a few bumps along the way. \nScience says love’s effect on the brain is as powerful as heroin , and it’s fair to say I’ve been a victim of its seductive pull.\nLike many addictive drugs, it has wonderful highs, but can also have terrible, soul-crushing lows.\nSo, now I know. \nIf my next relationship should end, and there’s no other reason for us to communicate, that’ll be it. Complete cold turkey. \nI’ll be civil and polite if I happen to bump into you, and of course look back kindly at the good times. But a close friendship straight away? Forget it.\nUnless there’s a reason why we should be friends then it’s not worth the turmoil of trying to adjust to a just-friends dynamic. \nAt least, initially until I’ve got you out of my system.\n\nI’m sorry if that sounds mean. \nYou can all say it’s just me, that most of my relationships or attempts at dating have eventually ended in tears or flames (or both), so obviously any friendship afterwards wasn’t going to work. \nBut if you cared about a person enough to love them, enough to open up and share the most intimate parts of yourself, then of course it’s going to be difficult if not impossible to adjust to something more platonic. \nThe spark might never disappear – as it never really did with my ex during our ‘friends’ period – and it might make it difficult for you to move on if they’re still a constant presence in your life. \nMore How to get over your embarrassment of being naked in gym changing rooms \nThis girl made her sister a brilliant T-shirt to fight back against sexist dress codes \nHere is yet more proof that redheads are the most beautiful people of all \n13 of the best bouquets to get delivered for Mother's Day \nAll I am saying is that, you don’t have to be friends with them just because it seems like the polite thing to do.\nAllow yourself time to recover and get your ex, the intoxicating drug that they are, out of your system – at least at first.
