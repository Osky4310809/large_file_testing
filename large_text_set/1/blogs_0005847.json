Chris Pratt has played everything from a bumbling shoe shine boy ( Parks and Recreation) to a handsome space crusader ( Guardians of the Galaxy) to a dinosaur wrangler ( Jurassic World ), but one role you won't likely see him playing anytime soon is a fishmonger. \nAs Pratt demonstrates in this video for Vanity Fair , his ineptitude at breaking down a fish would likely cause Gordon Ramsay's head to explode. Backed by an idyllic lakeside vista, the actor begins by jamming his knife behind the \"fish hand\" — that's the pectoral fin, Chris — and proceeds to fillet it within an inch of its (already expired) life. \nIf Pratt hopes to play a chef in any upcoming role, he's definitely going to need a culinary bootcamp session.
