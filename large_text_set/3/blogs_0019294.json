Passengers with these devices should check with their airlines for more details on transporting these items. \nThe additional security measures may cause some disruption for passengers and flights, and we understand the frustration that will cause, but our top priority will always be to maintain the safety of British nationals. \nDirect flights to the UK from these destinations can continue to operate to the UK subject to these new measures being in place. Travellers are advised to keep up-to-date with the latest FCO travel advice and to check online with their chosen carrier for further information. Which devices are not allowed in the cabin? large phones all tablets and e-readers Which flights and routes will this apply to? \nThese new measures will apply on all inbound direct flights travelling to the UK from the following countries: Turkey Tunisia Saudi Arabia \nPassengers travelling on these flights should check online with their carrier if they require further information. Should I cancel my trip? Is it still safe to go to these countries? \nThese new measures are concerned with flights into the UK . The UK is not stopping direct flights to and from those countries. Those with imminent travel should contact their airline for further information. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office also publishes travel advice . What’s a ‘normal sized mobile phone’? \nMost smart phones will be allowed in the cabin, including many common popular handsets such as: iPhone 7 Plus \nThe new UK measures will mean that phones, laptops and tablets larger than: length: 16.0cm \nwill not be allowed in the cabin. Can I take items purchased from duty free on board? \nAny phones, laptops or tablets larger than the above dimensions will not be allowed in the cabin, regardless of whether they were purchased in duty free. Why are these measures not in place for flights travelling from the UK ? \nThis applies to inbound flights. The UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world but we keep this under constant review based on assessment of risk. What about any costs incurred as a result of this? And what if I want to cancel my flight can I get compensation? \nThis is matter for the airlines. We encourage them to take a customer focused approach. How long will these measures be in place? \nThe UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world and we will continue to take all the steps we believe are necessary to put in place security measures we believe will be effective and proportionate. We keep our aviation security measures under constant review. Is this in response to a specific threat? \nIt is long standing government policy not to comment on intelligence matters. Why isn’t the UK following the US and banning all personal electronic devices from the cabin, why only phones, laptops and tablets? \nWe are confident these measures are proportionate and effective. What happens to passengers travelling from countries unaffected by the measures who are transferring to an affected flight? \nTransfer passengers who board a flight on a route affected will be subject to the measures.
