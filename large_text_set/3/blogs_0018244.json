While Allen may not do much during OTAs, he said his plan is to be working without restrictions come training camp and the regular season. \n“I’m not trying to kill myself . There’s still a long time until the season,” Allen said, via the Los Angeles Times . “I’m definitely trying to just keep getting stronger and then just try to be there for the whole season for my team.” \nA full season from Allen would be a big plus for the Chargers. He missed half the 2015 season with a lacerated kidney and the Chargers have missed him a great deal on offense.
