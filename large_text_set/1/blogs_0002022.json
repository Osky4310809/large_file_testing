Here are some interesting options to mix up your liquor cabinet. 1. PHOENIX TEARS SPICED RUM \nLike a noble phoenix rises from the ashes to live again, you too can rise from a hangover and imbibe. This 80-proof rum from Firebox is the perfect addition to any fiery cocktail. This Caribbean rum has a sweet and spicy flavor with a shimmery appearance. Unfortunately, just like Hogwarts, only citizens of the UK can partake. 2. UNICORN TEARS GIN LIQUEUR \nThis 80-proof gin liqueur claims to be made with real unicorn tears that were harvested right from the animals' eyes (but not really; sorry fairytale villains). Each bottle is almost 17 ounces and contains a shimmery concoction that tastes like oranges, juniper berries, coriander, and liquorice. Sadly, if you want to taste unicorn tears, you'll have to take a trip to the UK. 3. COOKIES AND CREAM WHISKEY \nYou can get whiskey that tastes like honey or cinnamon, but did you know you can get even wackier flavors? Booze lovers who also have a sweet tooth will be pleased to discover they can get their hands on some cookies and cream-flavored whiskey. Ole Smoky mixed 35-proof whiskey with cookies and cream liqueur to create a concoction that's delicious whether you're drinking it on the rocks or enjoying it on top of ice cream. 4. SESAME AND POPCORN DAIQUIRI \nPopcorn-flavored jelly beans are a source of contention for a lot of people, so this sesame and popcorn daiquiri—which you can pour directly into your glass, no mixing needed—is sure to be a controversial cocktail at any party. The nearly 17-ounce bottle is sealed with blue wax that smells like the salty booze inside. As long as you live in the UK, you can pick up a bottle to start arguments at your next shindig.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T02:11:14.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
