Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Anti-Trump protesters hold up signs as the motorcade of US President Donald Trump passes by in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday \nAnd his proposed budget slashes even eliminates completely a range of government programs designed to help the most vulnerable. \nAs a result pictures such as this have begun to emerge... Trump voter James Walker, 31, from Nashville, says: \"This is the first step: showing up and being honest.\" pic.twitter.com/kP1vLUHxNl — David Smith (@SmithInAmerica) March 15, 2017 \nAnd Walker is not alone. A Twitter account called ‘ Trump Regrets ’ has gained over a quarter of a million followers simply for retweeting disaffected Trump voters. \nThey can broadly be broken down into 10 categories.. 1) Those angry about The Wall \nTrump’s much-vaunted wall across the Mexican-US border was supposed to be paid for by Mexico but the latest estimates suggest each American household could end up forking out $120 (£96.70) each if the $15 billion (£12 billion) project goes ahead. @realDonaldTrump You cocksucker. I voted for you to make Mexico pay for the wall. Not me. DO SOMETHING. — dick hole (@Walrus_Butter) March 16, 2017 @realDonaldTrump Really sorry I voted for you , just embarrassing already let the rich and poor bite the bullet already F# #k the wall — Samuel Albert (@salbertzz) March 19, 2017 @POTUS you have no clue, don't need a wall. I am embarrassed too ever voted for you. — billybob (@BOBGOP2020) March 17, 2017 2) Those angry he’s targeting the country’s most vulnerable \nLast week Trump announced his proposed budget which dramatically boosted defence spending whilst slashing and even eliminating completely a range of government programs designed to help the most vulnerable. @realDonaldTrump U are not putting America first ! You are only putting the RICH first !! I've got your number now. Sorry I voted for you — Lynn Manuel (@Healthyonetoday) March 17, 2017 @realDonaldTrump I'm pissed. I voted for you but once again the poor and sick get screwed.
