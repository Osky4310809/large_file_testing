I felt happy, now that he can rest peacefully. \n\"Now I can celebrate the life, the love we had, and move on as one. Let him rest. I don't know what is yet to happen. I keep the happy times just him and me. \n\"I have always kept it between him and I. I have managed for five years not to be famous. I would like to go back to that.\" \nGeorge passed away at the age of 53 after his heart failed to pump blood around his body due to an enlarged left ventricle, while his liver was also clogged up with fat.
