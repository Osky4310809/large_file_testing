Antonio Conte is a big fan of the former Juventus hitman However, The Guardian add Madrid hope the desire of the 26-year-old to join and making players available to Chelsea in return will make an agreement easier to reach. Madrid president Florentino Perez is reportedly ready to offer both striker Alvaro Morata and unsettled playmaker James Rodriguez as part of the deal. Antonio Conte is a big fan of the former Juventus hitman, having eyed a move for the 24-year-old last summer. And it is claimed Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois and Madrid forward Morata switching teams will be the more straightforward half of the business. Ex-Atletico Madrid shot-stopper Courtois is open to a return to Spain’s capital, despite public claims he is content at Stamford Bridge. And Chelsea are apparently confident they can find a new keeper too, with Madrid focusing attention on the Belgian rather than David De Gea at Manchester United due to the difficulty in capturing him. Meanwhile, Morata is also open to playing in the Premier League. Madrid intend to bid for Hazard ahead of the summer transfer window, with at least a part-exchange of the four players possible.
