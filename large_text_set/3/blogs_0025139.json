Live in Los Angeles deserves not just one long-stem rose, but a whole dozen of them.\nThe first thing I observed upon sitting down was the “water on” button on my armrest, and right then I knew I was in for it.\nUnsure of where the water would be coming from, I decided to keep it on because who doesn’t love a little midday rain shower. With that in place I sat back, propped my feet up on the footbar, put on my 3D glasses and was ready to waltz .\n4DX is state-of-the-art technology that delivers an immersive multi-sensory cinematic experience, incorporating onscreen visuals with synchronized motion and environmental effects such as wind, fog, rain, lighting, scents (yes, imagine that yummy rose scent!), and snow to enhance the cinema experience.\nFROM COINAGE: The Cost of Beauty & The Beast ‘s Wedding Registry \nBasically, you are not going to fall asleep because the wolves chasing after your horse and carriage cause enough jolt to shake you awake.\nPositioned in a not-so-ordinary movie seat that mirrored a Brookstone massage chair, the seat featured three base movements: heave (moving up and down), roll (moving left and right) and pitch (tilting forward and back).\nOverall, it was hard to comprehend that I wouldn’t actually be moving into the castle with Belle (played by Emma Watson ) and the Beast-turned-Prince Charming (played by Dan Stevens ) at the end of the film — because it was that real!\nFrom the opening waltz scene where my chair swayed to the sweet tunes, to my seat bouncing up and down (and my body getting a nice wind chill) as Maurice (played by Kevin Kline ) rode through the snowy forest to save Belle from the seemingly scary Beast, I’d definitely invite you to be my guest to another screening of Beauty and the Beast in 4DX.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:52:13.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
