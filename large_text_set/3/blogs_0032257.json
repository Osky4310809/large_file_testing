It took Chicharito's Mexico tally to 46, level with Jared Borgetti for most goals for El Tri. \nIn one of Mexico's first attacks, Carlos Vela turned and slipped a pass through to Chicharito coming from the left side, and the striker was able to beat Keylor Navas to the ball and open the scoring. \nIt was Chicharito's seventh goal in World Cup qualification, while he also added 24 goals in friendly matches, seven in Gold Cups, three at the World Cup, three at the Confederations Cup, and one each in the CONCACAF Cup and the 2016 Copa America Centenario. \nTwenty-three of Borgetti's came in World Cup qualification with only nine in friendly matches. He had two each in the Copa America and the World Cup along with three Confederations Cup goals and seven strikes in the Gold Cup. \nChicharito matched Borgetti's pace, scoring in 89 games while Borgetti did the same, ending his Mexico career with 89 caps.
