No, the team didn’t give up a sloppy goal or get busted for a brutal hit. It was even worse: fans in Section 112 starting doing the wave.\nLuckily, the good people running the Coyotes’ Twitter account put out a crucial PSA to those in attendance at Gila River Arena:\nAttention fans in 112: We don't do the wave here.\n— #Yotes (@ArizonaCoyotes) February 21, 2017 There are maybe two occasions where doing the wave is acceptable in public, and “during the final minutes of a close NHL game” is nowhere near the list. Minor league baseball game? Fine, you’re probably there to have some wacky experiences and a few beers anyway. There’s a lot of downtime in baseball.\nBut the final minutes of an NHL game? That’s the time to hunker down and really focus on the entertainment product you presumably spent a bunch of money to attend in person. Who taught these people about waves in a desert anyway? \nThank you, Arizona Coyotes, for fighting the good fight.\n\n\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:24:06.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
