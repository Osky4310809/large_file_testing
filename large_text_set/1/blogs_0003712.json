Iraqi forces have so far only penetrated eastern districts of Mosul, which is bissected by the river. The city is Islamic State's last major stronghold in Iraq. \nCTS forces backed by U.S.-led air raids meanwhile clashed with Islamic State militants near a historic site a short distance away, an officer said, as they tried to drive the jihadists out of more districts in the city.

DIMITAR DILKOFF / AFP - Getty Images \n\"This morning CTS troops advanced in two directions towards the Baladiyat and Sukkar districts,\" Lt.General Abdelwahab al-Saadi said. \n\"During the advance, Daesh [ISIS] tried to confront us from the historic hill,\" he said, apparently referring to a hill located near the ruins of the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh, east of the Tigris river and inside Mosul. \nSaadi said Iraqi forces and warplanes from the U.S.-led coalition \"dealt with\" IS fighters who had gone up the hill to use it as a firing position. Dozens of the militants were killed, he added. \nThe CTS has spearheaded advances into eastern Mosul in the nearly 12-week campaign. \nForces including the CTS and army units have advanced further into Mosul in recent days, helped by new tactics and better coordination to gain fresh momentum after getting bogged down inside the city towards the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T18:16:36.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
