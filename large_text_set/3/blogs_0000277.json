Former Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear delivered his speech at a Lexington diner while surrounded by disinterested looking patrons, and let’s just say the internet had plenty of jokes. Plenty of the quips had little to with politics, which is a refreshing change in this current climate.\nPresumably, the Democrats chose their representative and the rebuttal setting for the down-home feel, which — perhaps, they hope — might reel in those blue-collar voters that went Republican in the election. Beshear paid lip service to fiscal responsibility, jobs, and church , all topics that could have swayed some Independents on the line. Unfortunately, the delivery and atmosphere of this rebuttal scored no points.\nBizarrely, Beshear evoked no enthusiasm, and the diner showed no trace of food, which is hellaciously awkward.\njust hanging out. in a diner. with no food. so natural. #DemResponse pic.twitter.com/E6ULFKJITh \n— Azi (@Azi) March 1, 2017 \n\n\nFurther Beshear’s fellow “patrons” exuded very little zest, which doesn’t go far to communicate Democratic revitalization. This should have been the left’s entire goal for the evening. Instead, people were reminded of infomercials for reverse mortgages and walk-in bathtubs.\n#Beshear in the #DemResponse looks like he's about to sell me a walk-in bathtub on late night TV. pic.twitter.com/gYrMshFMGG \n— Jonathan de Steuben (@jtdesteuben) March 1, 2017 \nHi I'm Steve Beshear, and Id like to tell you about the benefits of a reverse mortgage #demresponse pic.twitter.com/UkbTKxdZDe \n— Stoneule (@Stoneule) March 1, 2017 \n\nIn many other social media messages, comparisons between Beshear’s message delivery and promo videos for the Heaven’s Gate cult ran rampant.\nNow a word from the \n#DemResponse cult leader from Heaven's Gate. pic.twitter.com/9eibrih29M \n— LATiffani (@LATiffani1) March 1, 2017 \n\nHowever, one shining spark of light appeared. At least Beshear didn’t need to pause his speech for a refreshment, like Marco Rubio did a few years ago. #NeverForget\nRemember this?\nBeshear has a low bar. #JointAddress #DemResponse pic.twitter.com/sOyCJPtIJ4 \n— (((David Turnbull))) (@david_turnbull) March 1, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T07:07:04.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
