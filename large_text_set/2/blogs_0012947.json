Cruz (The Philippine Star)   12:00am Diamonds fail to outglitter Liza Soberano’s beauty \nMANILA, Philippines - Liza Soberano must have made Enrique Gil ecstatic. \nFor Liza’s 19th birthday last month, Enrique came bearing with three gifts, two of them now public knowledge, the trip to Japan for her entire family and a Chanel Boy Flap Bag. But the last item will have to remain confidential unless either or both are ready to disclose. \n“It’s easier to buy diamond than to find that style (of bag),” Enrique shared to his jeweler, Carl Deo Fider of Tessera Jewelry, about the high-ticket black diamond quilted Chanel Boy Flap Bag he gifted Liza for her Harry Potter-themed birthday bash. \nIn many ways, these gestures tell how he values his lady love, for sure, an ultimate expression of its truth. But behind the issue is the little-known fact Enrique gives multi-carat sparkling diamonds to himself such as a recent acquisition of a two-carat sparkler as revealed by his jeweler. \nInstead of buying current model road machines that depreciate, Enrique, who has also this thing for gold bling blings like diehard rappers, invests in diamonds that appreciates faster than real estate. Shrewd investor. He can wear his asset and keep it, too. \nWidely known as Marian Rivera and Heart Evangelista’s madness, diamonds are also Liza’s and Enrique’s. They look stunning on her, complementing her classic contemporary beauty and making his decidedly handsome features stand out at the 2016 Star Magic Ball. \nA semi-drop three-carat diamond earrings accented her simple floor-length soft lavender gown with intricate embroidery, long plunging illusion neckline and a V-shaped bare back. Co-designed with Michael Cinco, the elegant styling made her emerge as the Ball’s Best Dressed Female. She fell so in love with the ear danglers that she decided an outright purchase. \nEnrique as escort wore a diamond bow tie ring with three carats total diamond weight set in 14-karat white gold with matching diamond finger ring. \nWith such exquisite taste, Enrique must have imbibed it from his mother, former stewardess now businessperson Bambi Gil, who has such fine taste she collects art works like Russian icons. Liza gushes when she admits he continues to amaze her. \nWhat is the third gift? Clue: We’re told it celebrates their madness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:23:20.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
