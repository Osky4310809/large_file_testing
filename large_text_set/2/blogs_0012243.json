Gen. Michael Flynn's phone calls with Russia's Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak like it was the story of the century. Meanwhile, media was ignoring truly explosive revelations about secret meetings between Obama administration officials and Iranian operatives concerning the Iranian nuclear deal.\nIt almost looked like Obama adviser Ben Rhodes' media echo chamber was still operational even after his boss had left office.\nA U.S. intelligence official told NBC News that the FBI had found nothing improper in the eavesdropped telephone calls:\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said late Monday that there was never a formal \"investigation\" of the calls in December between retired Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn and Sergei Kislyak, Russia's ambassador in Washington.\nAccording to the source, who was confirming a Washington Post report earlier Monday, intelligence officials merely listened in as part of routine eavesdropping on Kislyak .\nSaid Steinberg:\nThese same \" often-clueless \" reporters the Obama administration was \" ventriloquizing \" were just utilized as gleeful political pawns yet again . Mike Flynn's brief calls and texts with the Russian ambassador should have immediately been dismissed as common diplomatic activity; they weren't, in service of a cynical political end sought by not just the Democratic Party, but by the media outlets themselves.\nWhile Flynn allegedly misled officials, including Vice President Mike Pence about what he said to Russia’s ambassador, the real story here is about who leaked classified information about his phone calls to the media.\nAccording to a report in the Washington Free Beacon , deep state loyalists are working diligently behind the scenes to undermine the Trump White House, while Ben Rhodes' gang of media toadies are indeed still \"ventriloquizing\" on the former president's behalf:\nThe abrupt resignation Monday evening of White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is the culmination of a secret, months-long campaign by former Obama administration confidantes to handicap President Donald Trump's national security apparatus and preserve the nuclear deal with Iran, according to multiple sources in and out of the White House who described to the Washington Free Beacon a behind-the-scenes effort by these officials to plant a series of damaging stories about Flynn in the national media.\nThe effort, said to include former Obama administration adviser Ben Rhodes—the architect of a separate White House effort to create what he described as a pro-Iran echo chamber—included a small task force of Obama loyalists who deluged media outlets with stories aimed at eroding Flynn's credibility, multiple sources revealed.\nThe operation primarily focused on discrediting Flynn, an opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, in order to handicap the Trump administration's efforts to disclose secret details of the nuclear deal with Iran that had been long hidden by the Obama administration.\nInsiders familiar with the anti-Flynn campaign told the Free Beacon that these Obama loyalists plotted in the months before Trump's inauguration to establish a set of roadblocks before Trump's national security team, which includes several prominent opponents of diplomacy with Iran. The Free Beacon first reported on this effort in January.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/15/report-obama-loyalists-led-by-ben-rhodes-orchestrated-flynn-ouster/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fbi-finds-nothing-amiss-flynn-russia-eavesdrop-official-n711226", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-reviewed-flynns-calls-with-russian-ambassador-but-found-nothing-illicit/2017/01/23/aa83879a-e1ae-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html?utm_term=.ec6d07320276", "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/former-obama-officials-loyalists-waged-campaign-oust-flynn/"], "published": "2017-02-15T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T19:25:02.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
