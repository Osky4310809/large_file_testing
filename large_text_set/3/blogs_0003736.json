Just another terrible decision!” Trump wrote. \nThe 113 of the 122 former prisoners confirmed by U.S. intelligence agencies to have “re-engaged” were released by Obama’s predecessor, George W Bush. \nBush began sending suspected al-Qaeda and Taliban combatants in January 2002 to the base on Cuba. \nData posted by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence showed that until the end of July 2016, 532 prisoners were released or transferred to the custody of other governments under Bush, with another 161 released under Obama. \nAmong those whose recidivism was considered confirmed, only nine were released by Obama. \nThe Pentagon said Monday that a U.S. airstrike against an al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) target last week in Yemen killed Yasir al-Silmi, who was held at Guantanamo from 2002 to 2009. \nThe BBC reported last month that Abu Zakariya al-Britani, a British-born Muslim convert who was held at Guantanamo for about two years starting in 2002, died in a suicide attack for the Islamic State movement against Iraqi forces near Mosul.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:55:56.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
