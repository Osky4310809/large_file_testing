Abbott Threatens to “Bring the Hammer Down” on Dallas After They Threaten to Become Sanctuary City \nEarlier this month, prior to the Houston-hosted Super Bowl, the NFL released a statement about inclusion for minorities, yet did not specifically address whether the passing of the bathroom bill could pose a risk for future Super Bowl events. \nTexas’ bill would require people to use bathrooms that correspond to the gender listed on their birth certificates, in an effort to protect women and children from predatory people trying to take advantage of inclusive bathrooms to target victims. However, when Abbot saw the threat the NFL made he responded vigorously. \nAbbot sent out a tweet of the CBS article with the caption, “NFL decision makers also benched Tom Brady last season. It ended with NFL handing the Super Bowl trophy to Brady.”   \nHave a look: NFL decision makers also benched Tom Brady last season. It ended with NFL handing the Super Bowl trophy to Brady. https://t.co/Qg06jT9RDp \n— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) February 11, 2017 \nAbbot is not backing down. He isn’t afraid of thinly veiled threats that are only meant to appease the liberal agenda. The NFL knows where its true football fans are and the revenue involved with hosting events in the Lone Star state. Abbot basically called the league out on its weak threat because he knows that the NFL’s decision-makers can be handled … and he’s not scared. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and be sure to add your thoughts to the comment section below.
