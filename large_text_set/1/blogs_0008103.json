Sincerely, my only intention was to salute the incredible bravery and courage of the men and women who work so tirelessly for UNICEF UK , Doctors Without Borders/ Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) , and World Food Programme , and the children of South Sudan, who continue to find hope and joy in the most difficult conditions.”\nHis fans responded encouragingly for the most part, posting comments like \"I understand what you were trying to say. The internet blows everything out of proportion,\" and \"You are at least using your platform to bring attention to worthy causes and to a dire situation. It's important to use your public voice for good.\"\nTo his credit, Hiddleston uses his accounts on social platforms like Facebook to often raise awareness for the work of those organisations, especially UNICEF, championing children's rights in countries experiencing conflict.\nGuess he's just really crap at speeches then?\nP.S.\nThe Golden Globes are broken. pic.twitter.com/wFPJaik5UC\n— Brian Josephs (@Bklyn_Rock) January 9, 2017\nBONUS: Watch Meryl Streep receive the Cecil B.
