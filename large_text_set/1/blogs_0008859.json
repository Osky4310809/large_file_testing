Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nCNN’s exclusive report on the Russians possibly having compromising information about Donald Trump had convinced some that the inauguration couldn’t possibly take place as scheduled. An hour later, though, after reading a secret dossier on Trump published by BuzzFeed, people were joking about whether #GoldenShowers or #GoldenGate should be the trending hashtag. When all the journalists say no, there's Buzzfeed. \n— Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) January 11, 2017 \nBuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith shared on Twitter a memo sent to staffers explaining why the site had rushed out the dossier, noting (after publication) that there was “serious reason to doubt the allegations” contained in it and claiming BuzzFeed had been “chasing specific claims in this document for weeks.” Chasing, not catching, mind you. We published the report making explosive but unverified allegations that Trump has deep ties to Russia https://t.co/1MxxelPlBs pic.twitter.com/p72JXPeeUi \n— BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) January 10, 2017 Here's the note I sent to @buzzfeednews staff this evening pic.twitter.com/OcAloWzVzb \n— Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 11, 2017 \nThe damning information wasn’t new to many reporters who’d seen it shopped around during the campaign but chose to pass. Even Mother Jones’ David Corn, who leaked the secret Mitt Romney video, stayed clear. 1. For those asking, I didn't publish the full memos from the intelligence operative because I could not confirm the allegations. \n— David Corn (@DavidCornDC) January 11, 2017 2. I believed it was fair & responsible to note that a credible source had provided FBI allegations of Moscow op to co-opt Trump. \n— David Corn (@DavidCornDC) January 11, 2017 3. I accurately characterized the memos-this is important stuff-but didn't publish details. Even Donald Trump deserves journalistic fairness \n— David Corn (@DavidCornDC) January 11, 2017 \nWell, then. Wait, so you're telling me David Corn and Harry Reid sat on this memo that would have doomed Trump? That seems totally like them \n— F. Bill McMorris (@FBillMcMorris) January 11, 2017 Oh.
