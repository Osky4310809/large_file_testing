So, when we saw someone had mashed up Beauty and the Beast and Harry Potter our fangirl radars were on overdrive.\nGiven that the live action remake of Beauty and the Beast is set for release in just over a month (!!!), it’s safe to say that there is going to be *a lot* of very excited people, us included. So far we’ve seen Beauty and the Beast makeup kit s emerge, Beauty and the Beast -themed afternoon tea , and even Beauty and the Beast Build-A-Bears! \nHowever, nothing would have prepared us for a Beauty and the Beast / Harry Potter mashup! Put together by Swedish comedy sketch duo PistolShrimps, the YouTube video reimagines the trailer for Beauty and the Beast as if the Beast was…Voldemort!\nTitled Beauty and Lord Voldemort , this rather strange hybrid actually works really well. With some pretty clever editing, various magical creatures from Harry Potter appear, including a hippogriff, dragons, and a house elf. There’s even a cameo from Gandalf, which, we know is Lord of the Rings , but seems fairly fitting in this rather strange movie dream mashup.\nWatch the bizarrely brilliant mashup, Beauty and Lord Voldemort, below.\n“Who could ever learn to love a real beast like Voldemort?” a caption on YouTube reads. Tbh, we’re SO darn impressed with how well this all comes together. PistolShrimps have really paid attention to detail, and we love how various characters manage to appear in scenes together. Also, the heightened magical element of adding Harry Potter style wands and creatures is a stroke of pure genius. Similarly, the Beast’s mansion being swapped out for Hogwarts is just wonderful.\nOne thing we’re not too sure on, however, is how one could possibly fall in love with Lord Voldemort. While the Beast learns to love again, we’re not sure that Voldemort would be able to change and transform back into Tom Riddle.\nRegardless, we’re in awe of the effort and skill that has gone into this mashup, and low key want it to become a reality *furiously pens fan fiction*.\nBeauty and the Beast hits cinemas on March 17th.\n[ H/T Refinery29 ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:30:50.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
