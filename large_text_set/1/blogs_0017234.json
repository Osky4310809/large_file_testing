Olszewski was on his way home to Brooklyn from a friend’s house. \nHe said he stumbled off the train completely engulfed in flames and smoke. Two conductors saw him and tried to help, but the suspect, identified by police as 18-year-old Christopher Jackson, of Brooklyn, didn’t try to get away. He just stood there, bizarrely laughing. \n“I was screaming from the pain.” Olszewski said. “He was enjoying it. He was still there next to me.” \nCourt records show the same teenager was charged with setting an arson fire in a trash can at Queens Vocational and Technical High School and two other sites back in October. \nOlszewski said he hopes Jackson will get jail time and something is done to better protect subway riders. \n“It’s not safe, people getting pushed onto the tracks. You know what I mean? Stabbed, robbed and now me catching on fire. Ridiculous,” he said. \nHe said it took all of his courage to get back on the train after getting out of the hospital burn unit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T17:02:47.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
