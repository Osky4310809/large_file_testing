Everybody says they are going to China because they are attracted by the project, but they are not telling the truth - they are going for the money. \nShanghai FA denies Rooney bid \n\"Football is competition, it is about measuring yourself with the best and then the money is secondary. Of course I'm well off and it's easier for me to say no [to China], but I'm definitely not going over there because I am attracted by any project. \n\"I definitely want to keep playing and enjoying myself. After my family, the most important thing for me in life is football. I love it and if there is an opportunity, I want to be enthusiastic and happy about it.\" \nCassano has spent over 17 years at the top of his chosen profession, turning out for Bari, Roma, Real Madrid, Milan, Inter, Parma and Sampdoria. \nHe has also earned 39 caps for Italy, while netting over 100 goals for club and country combined. \nIt has been a varied and colourful career for a man tipped in his younger years to become a global superstar, but he insists he has only one regret. \nPato completes switch to China \nCassano added: \"I've had a good career and I don't know if I could have done any more than I have. \n\"There's no room for 'ifs' in football. I had six years on my contract in (Real) Madrid and I left after just a year because I was a crazy fool. But that's the way I am, and that is my biggest regret. \n\"But then I moved to Sampdoria and got to know my wife. She changed everything. I have two magnificent children and an amazing wife.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:25:22.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
