Established in 1972, BMW Motorsport GmbH proceeded to raise the bar in the world of international car racing. Its highlights reel includes the starring role played by the sensational BMW M1 mid-engined sports car in the extraordinary Procar race series. Beyond this, BMW Motorsport GmbH also developed the first turbocharged engine to power a car to the Formula One World Championship title, and created what remains the world's most successful touring car racer: the Group A BMW M3. \nKnow-how from motor sport \nIn 1993 the wholly-owned subsidiary of BMW AG changed its name to BMW M GmbH. Offering products and services in the five business areas of M Automobiles and M Performance Automobiles, BMW Individual, M Sports Options and Packages, the BMW Group Driving Experience, and Safety, Emergency and Special-Purpose Vehicles, today BMW M GmbH focuses its attentions on customers with particularly high aspirations in terms of the performance, exclusivity and individual style of their vehicles. The letter M is synonymous all over the world for success in motor racing and for the fascination surrounding high-performance sports cars. \nSince 2012 BMW M GmbH has also offered the BMW M Performance product line comprising cars with M characteristics which slot in between the top-of-the-range standard BMW models and the M Automobiles built for maximum performance. These exclusive M Performance Automobiles appeal to customers keen for their BMW to offer a pronounced dynamic character without compromising on long-distance comfort or everyday practicality. With this objective in mind, the experience and expertise gathered by BMW M in motor sport and the development of high-performance sports cars have been channelled into the development of the suspension tuning, engine and design of the BMW M Performance Automobiles. 2017 BMW M760Li xDrive \nBMW M therefore acts as a source of expertise for the dynamically tuned M Performance Automobiles, replicating the role performed by BMW i in contributing innovative technologies for the BMW i Performance plug-in-hybrid models. This approach allows BMW to open up the cutting-edge technology developed by BMW M and BMW i to an even broader group of customers. \nSuccessful concept expands its sphere of influence \nMore than 30,400 M Performance Automobiles were sold worldwide over the course of 2016. \"Our success here shows that we are on the right track with this concept. We will therefore expand our product range wisely and close any gaps in the line-up strategically. After all, when you take a look at the BMW AG model portfolio, you will notice that not every model range includes a BMW M Performance Automobile,\" says Frank van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. \nThe new BMW M760Li xDrive is the latest M Performance Automobile to join the fray and brings together the many years of expertise built up by BMW M in the construction of sporty and exclusive cars. It spearheads the range of strikingly dynamic BMW M Performance Automobiles. \nPowertrain - The magnetic allure of a V12 \nA 12-cylinder engine traditionally enjoys a rarefied status beyond the reach of other configurations. It represents the ultimate expression of the engine-building art and justifies its stand-out reputation with an incomparably powerful and, at the same time, refined power delivery it alone has the means to provide. Under the bonnet of the new BMW 7-Series, the company's modified V12 once again conjures a way to cover the miles that is in many respects unique. And, in so doing, it underlines the special position occupied by a 12-cylinder model - in this new-generation BMW 7-Series, as in those that have gone before. \nA unique combination of power and refinement \nThe M Performance TwinPower Turbo 12-cylinder petrol engine in the new BMW M760Li xDrive has a capacity of 6,592 cc, develops output of 448 kW/610 hp at 5,500 rpm and peak torque of 800 Nm (590 lb-ft) from as low down as 1,550 rpm, and now also links up with the Auto Start Stop function (fuel consumption combined: 12.8 l/100 km [22.1 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 294 g/km). It accelerates the luxury sedan from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 3.7 seconds and on to a governed top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph) - or 305 km/h / 189 mph (governed) if the optional M Driver's Package is specified. In the construction of the all-aluminium block, the engineers focused on maximising rigidity while also minimising weight. Using a closed-deck structure combined with bolts holding the cylinder head down on the floor plate of the crankcase, the engine ensures maximum stability on the cylinder liners. Double bolts on the main bearings with an additional connection to the side panels through threaded support bushes and bolts reduce the influence of lateral forces from the crankdrive on the crankcase. Further components of the engine block that serve to reduce vibrations and noise to an absolute minimum are iron-coated aluminium pistons, forged connecting rods assembled using the cracking process, and a likewise forged crankshaft. \nIn addition, the M Performance TwinPower Turbo 12-cylinder petrol engine boasts an array of special technical features allowing even better use of the potential provided by the engine's construction principle and fundamental philosophy. Top of the pile are M Performance TwinPower Turbo technology and High Precision Injection. These features enable sharp and direct responses to even the slightest movement of the accelerator, a linear torque curve and exceptionally low fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for an engine in this performance class. \nM Performance TwinPower Turbo technology \nJoining the V12 under an engine cover bearing \"M Performance\" lettering are two mono-scroll turbochargers positioned - thanks to the small 60-degree cylinder angle - in a compact arrangement on the outside of the two rows of cylinders, each supplying six cylinders with compressed air. The turbochargers stand out with their unusually high level of compressor and turbine efficiency, and their positioning provides the ideal platform for short, straight and therefore flow-efficient pipe connections between the exhaust system and the turbochargers. \nTo ensure the sensitive and precise grading of power at all times, the compressed air from the turbocharger is cooled by a technically highly sophisticated indirect intercooler. This serves to minimise the overall volume of air required and to shorten lag times, enabling the engine to respond as effectively as possible to the driver's foot on the accelerator. An additional water pump feeds the separate coolant circuit required for this purpose, whose air-to-water heat exchangers are positioned directly on the intake manifold. \nM sports exhaust system delivers an emotionally rich V12 soundtrack \nThe catalytic converters of the 12-cylinder engine are equipped with cutting-edge exhaust gas sensors and quickly reach their optimum operating temperature thanks to their positioning close to the engine. Effective exhaust treatment allows the engine to comply with all the internationally applicable emissions guidelines. The BMW M760Li xDrive meets the EU6c exhaust standard. \nIn order to reduce backpressure, the M sports exhaust system in the car's underbody area features mostly straight pipe routing and the largest possible diameter. The evolution of the rear silencers and flap activation system allows a broad acoustic spread, supplying everything from maximum refinement to a full-bodied 12-cylinder soundtrack. The system adapts to the situation at hand and the driver's preferences, the charge cycle acoustics showcasing the car's understated air of elegance but also able to switch, as and when greater performance is called upon, to an emotionally rich 12-cylinder soundtrack that accentuates the dynamic character of the BMW M760Li xDrive. \nInjection system: precision with 200 bar of pressure \nHigh Precision Injection optimises the combustion process, contributing to the engine's extraordinarily efficient utilisation of the energy contained in the fuel. Injectors positioned centrally in the cylinder head measure out the fuel precisely and spray it into the combustion chambers in finely atomised form and at up to 200 bar of pressure. The fuel is dispersed according to an ideal model calculated in complex processes, allowing extremely consistent and clean combustion. This also has a positive effect on emissions and engine acoustics. The mixture cooling brought about by the directly injected fuel also allows a higher compression ratio than that achieved by a turbocharged engine with manifold injection. The engine therefore works extremely efficiently, delivering greater performance and lower fuel consumption. High Precision Injection teams up with BMW TwinPower Turbo technology in all the petrol engines for the BMW 7-Series, ensuring extremely efficient and clean combustion as a platform for fuel economy and emissions figures that are unsurpassed in this performance class. \nThe M Performance 12-cylinder engine also features, in customary BMW style, Double-VANOS continuously variable camshaft timing. This allows the engine to run under part loads with a high level of residual gas and reduced throttle losses, maximising fuel efficiency. Double-VANOS also contributes to the engine's rapid responses. \nThe oil supply to the M Performance 12-cylinder engine has been similarly optimised. Its volume flow-controlled pump operates only when required and is therefore extremely efficient. The six-chamber pendulum-slide pump only supplies the amount of oil required by the engine in whatever state of operation it finds itself in. Instead of a manual dipstick, a display in the instrument cluster can be called up at any time during a journey to show the oil level status. \nEight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission \nDrive from the most powerful petrol engine in the M Performance line-up is channelled through an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission, which is fitted as standard in the new BMW M760Li xDrive and also makes a significant contribution to the dynamic ability of this M Performance model. The M Performance-specific tuning of the shift programs, delivering sportier gear changes and more instantaneous downshifts throughout the rev range, has been specially adapted to the characteristics of the V12 engine and is also perceptible to the occupants through the functions of the Driving Experience Control switch. Carefully avoiding converter slip outside of gear changes results in a direct, sporty connection between the driveline and the engine. Furthermore, the eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission comes with a Launch Control function as standard. This easy-to-operate system paves the way for ambitious drivers to achieve optimum acceleration under all conditions in their BMW M760Li xDrive. The eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission can also be operated via the gearshift paddles on the steering wheel for an ultra-sporty driving style. In manual mode, the transmission follows the classical blueprint by holding the selected gear even when the engine hits the rev limiter. At the same time, its compact construction, low weight, optimised efficiency and flawless interaction with the Auto Start Stop function allows it to play a significant role in reducing fuel consumptions and emissions. \nDriving dynamics \nThe new BMW 7-Series model range already represents the benchmark in the premium luxury class when it comes to driving dynamics. Intelligent lightweight design, e.g. the use of high-rigidity and lightweight carbon-fibre elements in the passenger cell's Carbon Core structure, gives the new BMW 7-Series an extremely low centre of gravity, all of which puts it in the best possible place to offer sporty, agile handling and supreme driving dynamics, coupled with top-class ride comfort. \nPerformance mixed-size tyres optimise contact with the road \nThe new BMW M760Li xDrive is fitted as standard with exclusive, newly designed double-spoke 760M 20-inch M light-alloy wheels (front: 8.5 J × 20, rear: 10 J × 20) in a Cerium Grey metallic matt finish and with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tyres (front: 245/40 R20, rear: 275/35 R20). This wheel/tyre combination provides a noticeable and calculable improvement in driving dynamics without compromising the car's rolling comfort. The BMW M760Li xDrive can also be specified as an option with runflat tyres and any other 20-inch light-alloy wheels from the BMW 7-Series equipment range. Plus, an optional winter wheel set containing 19-inch light-alloy wheels can be ordered for use during the winter months. \nExecutive Drive Pro \nThe new BMW M760Li xDrive is equipped with the innovative Executive Drive Pro suspension system first introduced in the recently launched BMW 7-Series model range. Executive Drive Pro is an active suspension control system, which links up with two-axle air suspension and the Dynamic Damper Control system to deliver exceptional spring and damper comfort, not to mention extremely low vibration levels. It includes the updated version of the Dynamic Drive system, which reduces roll at the front and rear axles. The result is dynamic driving characteristics coupled with comfortable suspension tuning. \nActive roll stabilisation is now carried out electromechanically and allows body roll forces to be cancelled out particularly swiftly and precisely when taking corners at speed. The adjustable anti-roll bars allow the suspension system the greatest possible freedom of movement, which raises comfort levels when driving in a straight line. The comfort-enhancing effect is further heightened by the standard air suspension, which has been retuned specially for the new BMW M760Li xDrive and adapted to the car's more dynamic character. \nWhat's more, the new system is also more energy-efficient than a hydraulic equivalent. \nIntegral Active Steering \nThe new BMW M760Li xDrive is fitted as standard with innovative Integral Active Steering. The planetary gearset previously used at the front axle has given way to a variable steering rack ratio. By employing a more direct front axle steering ratio and turning the rear wheels in either the opposing or the same direction when steering - depending on the specific driving situation - this system reduces steering effort and increases both manoeuvrability in urban traffic and agility and directional stability during high-paced driving, while also ensuring an especially smooth and composed response when changing lane and cornering. The differing characteristics permitted by the steering electronics are linked directly to the Driving Experience Control switch and activated by selecting the relevant driving program. For their introduction in the BMW M760Li xDrive, the characteristics of the steering system and all the other chassis control systems have been tuned specifically to the dynamic character of this 7-Series variant. \nDriving Experience Control switch with Adaptive mode \nThe standard-fitted Driving Experience Control switch in the new BMW M760Li xDrive also allows the driver to activate Adaptive mode. This feature includes an anticipatory chassis control function and automatic selection of the driving mode best suited to the situation at hand. The advance information for regulating the combination of chassis systems is gleaned from the driving style analysis readings, data from the navigation system and a stereo camera. \nAll the driving modes of the Driving Experience Control switch have been comprehensively retuned to suit the dynamic character of the new BMW M760Li xDrive. \nRear-wheel-biased BMW xDrive all-wheel drive \nThe BMW M760Li xDrive comes as standard with BMW xDrive permanent all-wheel drive. This intelligent system is able to distribute torque fully variably between the front and rear axle, thereby ensuring an extremely high level of dynamic ability, agility and traction. The BMW xDrive system has been given a rear-wheel bias - and therefore even sportier tuning - in order to fortify the BMW M760Li xDrive with the driving dynamics typically offered by BMW M Performance models. \nInnovative driver assistance systems \nThe Driving Assistant Plus system has been expanded for the new BMW 7-Series model range to include the Steering and lane control assistant, Lane keeping assistant with active side collision protection, Rear collision prevention and Crossing traffic warning functions - and features as part of the specification for the new BMW M760Li xDrive. Meanwhile, the Traffic jam assistant - which involves semi-automated driving - can be used on any type of road. The Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function now only requires drivers to press a button to incorporate speed restrictions detected by the Speed Limit Info function. The new generation of the Surround View system also includes a 3D View and Panorama View option in the Control Display. \nDesign - BMW M Performance variant makes a clear visual statement \nThe new BMW M760Li xDrive sees BMW M GmbH presenting an all-new take on emotionally rich sporting appeal and prestigious exclusivity, whose finely balanced nature proves particularly compelling. By showcasing the neatly honed proportions of the new BMW 7-Series and accentuating its own impressive dynamic potential through every area of its styling, the BMW M760Li xDrive leaves no room for doubt: this is the flagship model of the new BMW 7-Series family. \nM aerodynamic package accentuates sporting exclusivity \nThe new BMW M760Li xDrive underlines the refined sporting character, exclusive elegance, advanced technology and unbeatable build quality it shares with all of its new 7-Series siblings. The M aerodynamic package fitted as standard imbues the car's proportions and precise lines with even more of the presence for which the brand is renowned. The newly designed front apron features two large air intakes to the left and right, which take on a still more voluminous appearance in the absence of foglamps. Running along the upper edge of each intake is a Cerium Grey trim strip. The kidney grille bars and active air flap louvres are also fronted in Cerium Grey and have high-gloss Black sides. The grille elements are framed by a Cerium Grey surround. \nAlong the sides of the car, the Cerium Grey trim elements on the lower edge of the doors, the Air Breathers and the door handle trim provide new surroundings for the prominent double swage line and turn the body's character line into an even more prominent feature. Exclusive mirror caps, \"V12\" badges on the C-pillars and the M logo on the front wings - all in Cerium Grey - provide fitting adornments for the car's flanks. And exclusive 20-inch M light-alloy wheels with a new double-spoke design and surfaces painted in matt Cerium Grey advertise the car's elevated dynamic aspirations as a BMW M Performance Automobile. \nElsewhere, the sporting design of the rear apron with its black central area highlights the M sports exhaust system's Cerium Grey twin tailpipe embellishers with exclusive V12 geometry. The optional M rear spoiler optimises the flow of air, while the boot handle strip, which links together the L-shaped LED rear lights, the model badge on the right-hand side of the boot lid and the xDrive lettering on the left, ensures the performance potential of the BMW M760Li xDrive is also clearly evident at the rear of the car. \nAn interior shaped by sporting elegance \nInside the car, carefully arranged M accents provide an elegantly sporting allure. Gleaming door sill plates in Fine Brushed Aluminium with an illuminated V12 logo indicate the presence of the range-topping engine underneath the bonnet. The rim of the exclusive M leather steering wheel features an M logo on the centre spoke and gearshift paddles on the reverse. The multifunction buttons on the steering wheel spokes and the spoke inlays are finished in Pearl Gloss Chrome. The instrument cluster contains an exclusively designed speedometer, which now extends as far as 330 km/h (205 mph). The model designation is positioned at the centre of the dial, offering a clear hint as to the performance the BMW M760Li xDrive is ready to unleash. The M pedals and M driver's footrest in stainless steel with black rubber inserts provide an additional sporty-technical touch and accentuate the character of the BMW M760Li xDrive as a driver's car. A BMW Individual decorative inlay - in Piano Finish Black and bearing a V12 badge - positioned in the area around the selector lever and iDrive Controller lends even greater exclusivity to the interior. \nEquipment \nIn keeping with its role as the standard-bearer of the new BMW 7-Series model range, the BMW M760Li xDrive is kitted out with an extremely extensive list of equipment items as standard: the M aerodynamic package, 20-inch M light-alloy wheels in Cerium Grey metallic matt with mixed-size tyres, an M sports exhaust system with flap control, Executive Drive Pro, Integral Active Steering, Adaptive LED headlights with anti-dazzle High-beam assistant and Dynamic Damper Control are all in place without an options box needing to be ticked. Likewise included are BMW gesture control, the keyless Comfort Access system, a rain sensor, Active Protection to optimise occupant protection, electrically adjustable comfort seats at the front, sunblinds for the rear windscreen and rear windows, Exclusive Nappa leather trim with extended features, an Alcantara headliner, Fineline black fine wood trim with high-gloss metal effect, an M leather steering wheel and exterior features in the Cerium Grey shade exclusive to M Performance models. \nExtensive line-up of BMW ConnectedDrive features \nThe new BMW M760Li xDrive comes as standard with the full array of BMW ConnectedDrive products and services. These include the latest-generation BMW Navigation system Professional with high-resolution colour touchscreen and iDrive Touch Controller. BMW ConnectedDrive Services, meanwhile, enable access to the intelligent link-up of driver, vehicle and outside world. And the SIM card integrated into the car allows those on board to make use of innovative features such as the Concierge Service and RTTI (Real Time Traffic Information). \nBMW Remote Services allow customers to activate vehicle functions such as operating the air-conditioning system, locking and unlocking the car, operating the headlight flasher or carrying out a location search, either by using the My BMW Remote app or by telephone via the BMW call centre. The telephony with wireless charging and USB interface function enables inductive charging of a mobile device and, at the same time, allows users to connect up to two mobile phones and an audio player to the car via Bluetooth. The WiFi hotspot, moreover, establishes an internet connection for up to 10 devices. \nNeedless to say, the BMW M760Li xDrive can be configured and equipped to individual tastes. To this end, customers can choose from virtually the full range of optional equipment available for the BMW 7-Series model series. \nBMW Laserlight with BMW Selective Beam and a range doubled from 300 to 600 metres is one of the pioneering innovations on offer for the BMW 7-Series. With other attractive equipment features available, such as the BMW Head-Up Display, active seat ventilation, ceramic applications for the controls, BMW Night Vision with pedestrian recognition, Driving Assistant Plus with Collision Warning, Pedestrian Warning and City Braking function, and Surround View generating a 360-degree image of the area around the car, customers can tailor their BMW M760Li xDrive comprehensively to their personal wishes and requirements. \nIntelligent Emergency Call offers an unparalleled service \nIntelligent Emergency Call is also part of standard specification for the BMW M760Li xDrive and offers world-leading functionality in the automotive sector. The system springs into action automatically, as well as when help is summoned manually. In the event of an accident, Intelligent Emergency Call sets up a connection to the BMW call centre via the SIM card embedded in the vehicle; call centre staff then make direct contact with the occupants. At the same time, the vehicle's location and the potential risk of injury to its occupants are transmitted to ensure a quick rescue response, even if nobody in the vehicle is able to talk. \nIntuitive operation with touch display and BMW gesture control \nAs in all variants of the new BMW 7-Series, the monitor of the iDrive operating system comes in touch display form in the new range-topping BMW M760Li xDrive. This means customers will be able to navigate around the system in the same way as with modern electronic devices. In addition to using the Controller to operate the system in the familiar style, its functions can be selected and activated by touching the screen's surface. \nThe iDrive system also features gesture control, presented in the BMW 7-Series for the first time. Hand movements detected by a 3D sensor control infotainment functions in what is an extremely intuitive and user-friendly approach. The gestures can be used for a number of functions, including controlling the volume in audio applications and accepting or rejecting incoming telephone calls. There is also the option of pairing a specific gesture with an individual choice of function. There is also a new smartphone holder integrated into the centre console, which enables wireless, inductive charging for mobile phones for the first time in a car. \nBMW M760Li xDrive V12 Excellence \nThe preferences and requirements of its customers have always been the key guiding influences for BMW in the design and construction of the company's vehicles. It is therefore no surprise that BMW M760Li xDrive customers can tick a box marked \"BMW M760Li xDrive V12 Excellence\" and in so doing alter the inherent character of their car. The V12 Excellence shifts its focus away from the strikingly dynamic appearance of its sibling to emphasise the comfort-related attributes of the BMW M760Li xDrive and underscore the exclusive status of the V12 sedan. And that makes the flagship BMW 7-Series a strong recommendation for customers who also enjoy the view from the luxurious rear compartment of their car. \nExternally, the BMW M760Li xDrive V12 Excellence trades the M aerodynamic package for visual cues from the Pure Excellence exterior design package. These include 20-inch BMW Individual light-alloy wheels in W-spoke 646 design, high-gloss polished, with mixed-size tyres (front: 245/40 R20, rear: 275/35 R20) and brake callipers in high-gloss Black. The front end of the BMW M760Li xDrive V12 Excellence has a chrome bar extending across the full width of the car in the upper section of the air intake grille, while the kidney grille bars are in Silver with chrome fronts, and their surrounds likewise sport bright chrome. Added to which, the V12 Excellence features LED foglamps in the front apron. \nOn the car's flanks, a bright chrome finish adorns the window frames, the Air Breathers with door trim element and the V12 lettering on the C-pillars. The M logos rearwards of the wheel arches on the front side panels are deleted. Further back, a gleaming xDrive badge sits on the left-hand side of the boot lid above the chrome boot lid handle strip, with V12 lettering replacing the model designation on the right-hand side. The comfort-oriented exhaust system has a refined and understated note. Its two chromed, rectangular tailpipe embellishers are now framed in the rear apron by an additional chrome surround which creates a visual link between them. \nThe optional BMW M760Li xDrive V12 Excellence character variant also brings with it the features of the Pure Excellence interior design package. For example, the Alcantara headliner, door sill plates in Fine Brushed Aluminium with illuminated V12 badge and precise decorative stitching in the lower section of the instrument panel. Fine wood inlays for the seat belt outlet covers, armrest and rear roof grab handles, along with exquisite deep-pile floor mats for the rear compartment, additionally lend the interior an inviting and sophisticated aura. The BMW leather steering wheel with wood applications creates an elegant accent, and when the driver fires up the engine a V12 emblem lights up in the centre of the instrument cluster - whose speedometer extends as far as 260 km/h (160 mph).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T06:31:27.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
