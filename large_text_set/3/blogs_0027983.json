The two found something that Casey said \"looked like a sprinkler\" they investigated it and it exploded, sending orange dye everywhere. Casey was dead within minutes.It turns out the device was an M-44 cyanide trap that had been left just off our property by the USDA's mis-named Wildlife Services program. We rushed our son to the hospital, and thankfully, he was not poisoned, but he is now dealing with the tragic and avoidable loss of his best friend.I don't want another family to go through such a tragedy and have to endure heartache like we have. It was heartbreaking enough to lose my family pet, but the thought of my son is a whole different category. I believe we will eventually lose a child to these cruel pathetic devices.Sign my petition and help make sure families don't ever have to go through this again. Demand the USDA Wildlife Services program end their use of lethal traps, and prioritize non-lethal efforts in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T18:59:03.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
