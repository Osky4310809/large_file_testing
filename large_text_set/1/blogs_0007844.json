The much-anticipated blockbuster will begin production in just a few weeks, but it looks like one of its actors has still not seen its script. Just yesterday, Chris Hemsworth told MTV ’s Josh Horowitz the frustrating fact as he walked the red carpet at the Golden Globe Award.

When Horowitz asked whether he has seen the script yet, Hemsworth had this to say: \n“No. [It’s] a little nerve-racking a couple weeks out, isn’t it? But this is the way Marvel does it.” \nOf course, that is not the news fans were hoping to hear. While Hemworth is good at keeping the secrets of the Marvel Cinematic Universe safe, hearing that the actor has at least seen the script for Avengers: Infinity War would have gotten fans hyped. \nRight now, fans are just going to have to wait for more updates about the movie as shooting gets closer. Not long ago, it was reported that the film would be spending time abroad as it plans to shoot in Scotland. The project will film in cities like Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the norther Highlands towards Inverness. \nDuring the interview, Hemsworth was also asked about his involvement with the fourth Star Trek film. The actor was asked if he was still part of the movie, and Hemsworth confirmed he was taking part. \n“Yeah, I’m not sure exactly the dates, but I’ve spoken to J.J. and he has this amazing sort o pitch on the whole thing,” he revealed. \nAnd, unsurprisingly, the actor kept mum about how his character will return to the Star Trek franchise. Hemsworth starred in the first film to play the father of Captain Kirk, but he was killed just a few minutes into the film. So far, fans have wondered whether time-travel or parallel universes might be behind the elder Kirk’s return, but Hemworth says he knows just as much as fans do. \n“No, no honestly. I don’t know, but that a little further off than the Marvel stuff,” Hemsworth commented.
