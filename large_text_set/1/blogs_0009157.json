We can expect it to happen on a roughly annual basis.” \nHe added that the storms would be more likely on the north and west coasts because of their geographical position. Their placement means they will usually be the first areas to receive Arctic winds. \nWill it cause disruption? \nJust small amounts of snow in the UK can cause disruption, even when the weather is clear. The added hazards of a storm are expected to exacerbate this. \nTravellers are being advised to expect difficult driving conditions and extended journey times. \nThe RAC’s Rod Dennis said: “The fact that drivers in some parts of the country will be faced with strong winds, snow showers and icy stretches increases the chances of problems on the road enormously.” \nHe urged drivers to plan trips carefully and “consider rearranging any non-essential journeys in the parts of the country most likely to be affected by the bad weather”, as well as checking tyre tread and pressure, windscreen wipers and screen wash levels.
