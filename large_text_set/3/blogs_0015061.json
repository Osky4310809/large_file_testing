Week Two (that's this week!) is focused on link building, identifying opportunities to take over SERP features, and doing that all-important competitive research. \nThis time around, we're using a mix of Open Site Explorer, Fresh Web Explorer, and Moz Pro. Open Site Explorer has some free capabilities, so if you'd like to follow along... \nOpen OSE in a new tab! \nIf you're a Moz Pro subscriber, crack open your campaigns and settle in.

Luckily, Jordan's here to explain how to quickly find unlinked mentions of your site or brand using Open Site Explorer and keep those pesky Smiths references out of your results. \nFix #2: Prioritizing and organizing your link building efforts Link building requires more than just finding opportunities, of course. April shows how you can prioritize your efforts by identifying the most valuable linking opportunities in Open Site Explorer, then dives into how you can cultivate a continuous stream of fresh related content ripe for a link-back with Fresh Web Explorer . \n\nFix #3: Ranking in position zero with SERP features in Moz Pro If you have keywords that aren't ranking in the first few results pages, don't despair â€” there's hope yet. There are tons of opportunities to rank above the first organic result with the prevalence of SERP features . In this video, Ellie shows how you can identify keywords that need some love, track SERP feature opportunities for them, filter your keywords to show only those that surface certain SERP features, and more. \n\n\nFix #4: Gleaning insights from your competitors' backlink profiles Remember April from Fix #2? She's back and ready to show you how to get the skinny on your competitors' juicy backlink profiles using both your Moz Pro campaign and Open Site Explorer. \n\n\nOne step beyond That wraps up our latest week of fixes!
