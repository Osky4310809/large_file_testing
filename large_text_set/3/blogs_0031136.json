As part of her plea, she admitted to a series of bizarre details in the case, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE.\nShe faces 20 years in prison at her sentencing next month; PEOPLE has not been able to reach her or her attorneys for comment.\nHere are five things to know about what happened.\n1. Clark Used Syringes to Try to Impregnate Victim Clark told investigators she paid â€œcoyotesâ€ $3,000 in 2012 to bring a 22-year-old woman across the border, court records show.\nThe victim was promised $4,000 to serve as a surrogate for Clark and her boyfriend, according to the records. The woman later told authorities that Clarkâ€™s fertilization efforts began a week into her stay.\nDocuments confirm that the woman said Clark tried to impregnate her with syringes filled with sperm from Clarkâ€™s boyfriend, which was retrieved from condoms.\nAccording to the court filings, the woman also told investigators that Clark would sometimes inject her three to four times a day when she was ovulating.\nBefore crossing the border, the woman says Clark promised the surrogacy would take place â€œin a legal and medically supervised fashionâ€ and that she would receive full medical care â€” but court documents indicate she never â€œvisited a doctor.â€\n2. Clarkâ€™s Victim Endured Emotional and Physical Abuse When nine months of attempted conception failed, the woman said Clark became physical and psychologically abusive, and forced her to perform â€œdomestic labor,â€ according to court documents.\nThe records reveal the labor included looking after Clarkâ€™s dog and cleaning her condominium, while Clark started rationing the victimâ€™s food as she believed the victim was having trouble getting pregnant because of her weight.\nThe woman was fed only beans and lost 65 lbs., the documents state.\nOn at least five separate occasions, the woman was also beaten after refusing to comply with Clarkâ€™s wishes, according to the filings. She was also prohibited from changing her clothes â€œfor long periods of time.â€\n3. Church Acquaintance Reported the Abuse Prosecutors say the victimâ€™s abuse lasted for more than two years â€” and only stopped after someone the victim knew through Celebration Church in Jacksonville, Florida, saw her â€œwashing cars in very cold weather with insufficient clothing and found behavior to be strange.â€\nThat person also saw signs of physical abuse and documented the womanâ€™s injuries before notifying police.\nThe same person attempted to aid the victimâ€™s escape efforts several times, providing her with cash and a phone so she could call her family in Mexico. But court records show that Clark beat the woman after learning she had called home for help.\nâ€˘ Pick up PEOPLEâ€™s special edition True Crime Stories: Cases That Shocked America , on sale now , for the latest on Casey Anthony, JonBenĂŠt Ramsey and more. \nBecause the woman never conceived a child, Clark told her she needed to either pay back or work off the $3,000 spent to bring her to America, according to court documentsÂ Clark even seized the womanâ€™s ID to prevent her from fleeing.\nClark also forced the woman â€œto have sex with two complete strangers through threats of force and coercionâ€ and threatened to hurt her family if she ever attempted to escape, the documents state.\nAt one point, Clark forced the woman to work in local restaurants â€” but kept her earnings.\n4. Clark Used Intimidation to Control Her Victim Records show the victim told federal agents that Clark forbade her from leaving her one-bedroom condominium in Jacksonville. The victim was told the neighborhood was dangerous and that she â€œwould most likely be killedâ€ if she ventured outside.\nClark also told the woman that she read Tarot cards and told her that if she ever tried to hide anything, â€œClark would find out,â€ the documents state.\nIn addition, according to court records, Clark threatened the womanâ€™s family: She told her that if she tried to escape, â€œClark would insure that her family and child in Mexico would be harmed.â€\n5. Clark Alienated the Victim from Her Family Clark was indicted in 2015 on charges of bringing in and harboring aliens, sex trafficking of children, forced labor and furthering slave traffic, soon after investigators learned of the abuse, according to records.\nHer guilty plea on Monday resolved those charges.\nâ€œClark isolated the victim from her family,â€ prosecutors said in a statement. â€œShe also attempted to collect from the victimâ€™s family the cost she had paid to the â€˜coyotes,â€™ with interest.â€\nAt one point, Clark received a call from the womanâ€™s brother, who was told she could not speak on the phone â€œbecause that caused stress which interfered with the attempts at insemination.â€\nAccording to court papers, Clark traveled to Mexico in 2014 to meet with the victimâ€™s family. She told them the woman was no longer living with her after she found a new boyfriend in Florida.\nClark also told the womanâ€™s family she â€œwanted nothing to do withâ€ them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:05:55.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
