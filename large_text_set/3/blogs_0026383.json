It's seem to be that snatching babies is a scam to collect Government found money from SSI. SSI will pay $1000 to $2500 a month per child adopted. Children Rights are being Violated, Parents Rights are being Violated, Human Rights are being Violated along with our Constitutional Rights!!Our children are being removed from homes with false paperwork and are DHS/CPS has field the children. Children are being sold for government paychecks, and pedophile rings. In my research I have found, that judges lawyers doctors and high officials adopt alot children. Some with 10 or more children adopted to one house hold. Now take a min and think about what I just wrote.. of one person adopts 10 kids and gets on the low end $1000 a month per child that is $10,000.00 a month paycheck. You are hearing about it everywhere. How the children are not being feed, they're being abused, sexually transmitted diseases, and some cases died in these foster homes! THIS is happening by a complete stranger when there is a family to care for them, even if the parents are not suitable. If you take the money that the criminals are ripping off our government for and stop paying SSI to a adopted family for adopted children. Intern take the money and start helping our homeless veterans. Fix healthcare for the Mental Health, the Sick, and the Elderly. If you want to adopt a child, Then you should have the money to raise that child. This would stop the BABY SNATCHING because they can't get paid anymore. This would shore slow down the pedophiles with way less involvement to your children .. and the only way someone could get SSI for a adopted child, is if that child was taken away with only a Jury Trial of our peers. Not who just the court picks or pays to set on a Jury!It's NOT Right for our children to be sold for any reason. And it's happening everyday. It's NOT Right for the man and woman who fought for this country to be homeless and hungry bc Our Government failed THEM!Change Starts with you. Here is my idea. It's your turn to show your support for the children, veterans, and fix some of this Healthcare mess. DO NOT BE AFRAID To STAND UP For WHAT IS RIGHT!! This may or may not effect you directly bit note it effects someone's life. Maybe YOUR Mother, Sister, Brother, Cousin, YOUR child, or YOUR Grandchild. Have a voice and let's STOP the Madness! Let's Stand for Our Families and Our Constitutional Rights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:55:43.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
