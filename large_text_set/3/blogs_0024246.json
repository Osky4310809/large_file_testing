His name was brought back into it recently when there were rumblings that he would run for U.S. Senate. \nAt the Adobe Summit in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Manning addressed those rumors with a firm answer. “I don’t know where that came from,” Manning said. “Last week I was going to run a team, this week I going to apparently run for Senate, and next week I’ll be an astronaut. … I have no interest in the political world, but would like to continue serving communities.” \nManning has the intelligence, integrity and likability to succeed in just about any field he ventures into, which is why there’s so much speculation about what he’ll do next. Will he make the move to the front office like John Elway? Or will he keep to himself for the most part, similarly to the way Brett Favre has? \nNo one truly knows what Manning will do next, and even he’s not sure. He’s just taking it one step at a time right now. “I’m excited about the next chapter of my career. We have young kids and they’re in kindergarten. … Now I get to drop my kids off at school and I have even joined a health club. … I have a bucket list, but I enjoy having more freedom, especially in the fall. “The best advice I got was to not sign up for something full-time right away that you can’t commit to. I’m taking my time and seeing what my options might be.” \nManning did touch on missing the NFL, and the parts about it that he reminisces about. “I miss the camaraderie of teammates. … You do everything together. You practice together, you eat together, you sit in these team meetings together. And I miss the plane rides after a win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:39:20.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
