PA:Press Association 4 Marcus Rashford says it will be up to his bosses where he plays in the summer \nIt has put United boss Mourinho on a collision course with the FA over using the teenager at the end of the season. \nRashford said: “It is up to the coaching staff and the managers to decide if I go to that. \n“But if I do go, I’ll be approaching it with the same attitude as I do to the seniors. It is exciting times. \n“Getting tournament experience is massive, as long as everything is aiming towards the long-term objective, we obviously want to be successful and win trophies. \n“So whatever we have to do to get to that, whether it is going down to gain the experience, everyone is happy to do that.” PA:Press Association Jose Mourinho is set for a collision course with the FA over how much Marcus Rashford plays \nRashford has highlighted the importance of tournament experience, with last summer’s disastrous Euros his first taste. \nHe said: “Obviously there is are a lot of lessons to be learnt. It was my first major tournament and going out was disappointing. \n“At the time you never want to be knocked out of a tournament, you always picture yourself going on to win it. \n“All we can do now is get those experiences that we gained in the Iceland game and put everything together and move on for the future.” \nRashford has struggled for goals this season with his last Premier League strike coming in September. \nBut he insists he is a better all-round player this season under Mourinho.
