(Andrew Harnik/Associated Press) Stop despairing, women with “issues” and “difficulties” — President Trump says first lady Melania Trump will be there for you.\nAsked in a word salad of a news conference Thursday about what role Melania Trump will play, the president offered up an answer that actually provided us with some new information. FLOTUS “feels very strongly about womens’ issues, womens’ difficulties,” Trump said.\nThe first lady has not talked publicly about taking on that particular portfolio — until now, she had said that cyberbullying would be a focus . It’s still unclear just how Melania Trump, who lives in Manhattan while her 10-year-old son finishes the school year, will tackle the issues she wants to champion. But here’s one clue that she’s ready to start using the East Wing as bully pulpit: In tweets this week, she’s been using the hashtag #Powerofthefirstlady.\nTrump also said that “helping her” would be his older daughter, Ivanka, a public acknowledgment of a dynamic already in play: Ivanka Trump, who has already committed to working for wage equality and child care, is taking on some very first-lady-like duties.\nTrue to form, Trump lashed out at criticism of his third wife, who he called a “very private person” and also, perplexingly, “always the highest quality you’ll ever find.”\n“I think she’s going to be a fantastic first lady,” he said.\nWe are responsible for empowering our next generation with values #powerofeverychild #Powerofthefirstlady pic.twitter.com/L1FcuTNKwg\n— Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) February 11, 2017", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/powerofeverychild?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Powerofthefirstlady?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/FLOTUS/status/830562934178840581", "https://twitter.com/@emilyaheil"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:39:50.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
