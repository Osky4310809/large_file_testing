Jamie Lovett 0 comments \nHugh Jackman will wrap up his time playing Wolverine in Logan , his third Wolverine solo film since debuting in the role in 2000’s X-Men . With the end near, many fans have speculated as to whether Jackman will finally wear something that looks like a classic Wolverine costume from the Marvel Comics Universe. \nJackman, intentionally or otherwise, just threw some more fuel on that fire. Jackman tweeted out a photo of a Wolverine action figure that features the classic brown and tan costume. The tweet’s text reads, “THE ORIGINAL.” \nCheck it out below: — Hugh Jackman (@RealHughJackman) February 4, 2017 \nA quick correction for Mr. Jackman: that is not Wolverine’s original costume. Perhaps he was referencing this as being a representation of the original Wolverine, the one from the comics that existed before he played him, but if it is a reference to the costume then that’s not quite right. \nThe original Wolverine costume is the blue and yellow look. Wolverine was drawn in that costume in his very first appearance, though the whiskered max was redesigned when he joined the X-Men. \nThe brown and tan costume came later and was designed by iconic X-Men artist John Byrne. Wolverine was Bryne’s favorite X-Men character and he felt like the yellow and blue look was a bit garish for a trained killer like Wolverine. \nWhile the brown and tan costume was not the original, it is the costume that Wolverine wore for the longest consecutive period of time, so it is an understandable error. Wolverine wore the brown and tan costume all through the 1980s. In the early 1990s, artist Jim Lee “fixed” Wolverine by giving him his original costume back. \nAs to whether Jackman is teasing a costume appearance in Logan , probably not. It seems more likely that Jackman came across the old action figure and decided to have a little fun, but you never know for sure. \nHow does Wolverine's brown and tan look rank among his other classic costumes?
