Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nAs Twitchy reported, Judge Derrick K. Watson on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order blocking President Trump’s revised travel ban just hours before it was to take effect nationwide. \nMuch like the judge who blocked Trump’s original executive order, Watson cited statements made by Trump when he was a candidate in making his decision. BREAKING: Hawaii Judge halts extreme vetting/travel order based on statements from Trump at campaign rallies. WHAT ABOUT THE LAW??? \n— Cookie (@Cookiemuffen) March 15, 2017 \n“A reasonable, objective observer — enlightened by the specific historical context, contemporaneous public statements, and specific sequence of events leading to its issuance — would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion, in spite of its stated, religiously-neutral purpose,” Watson concluded, citing quotes from the debates, “Anderson Cooper 360,” and “Meet the Press.” Federal judge says Trump's own \"Muslim ban\" statements + Rudy/Stephen Miller comments \"betray the Executive Order’s stated secular purpose\" pic.twitter.com/ObZmIpw2qH \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 15, 2017 Did their best to tailor the new EO to comply with the law. Last remaining Q was would it pass test as religious ban. For one judge, didn't \n— Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) March 15, 2017 Based on campaign rhetoric. The judge should be impeached. https://t.co/cuDhR5QcJ8 \n— Derek Hunter (@derekahunter)   If judges are going to rule based on campaign rhetoric, maybe it's time to revisit some other laws \nIs it just us, or does that make anyone else nervous? Politicians sure as hell aren’t held to actually keeping the promises they made on the campaign trail, but judges can use that same rhetoric in rendering decisions like this one? If so, it’s definitely time to revisit some other executive orders and legislation. The people now claiming extralegal statements matter more than legal text demanded that we ignore everything Gruber said about Obamacare. \n— Sean Davis (@seanmdav) March 15, 2017 @seanmdav We should challenge every gun control law passed before about 1970. \n— Charles C.
