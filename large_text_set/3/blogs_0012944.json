Serving as his first project with Epic Records, the follow up to 2015's Black Market contains a star-studded lineup consisting of comedian Chris Rock, Nas, Future, Gucci Mane, Young Thug , Jeezy, Meek Mill , Wale, Ty Dolla $ign , Rapheal Sadeeq, Yo Gotta & many more. Meanwhile, production is handled by the likes of Beat Billionaire, C Gutta, J Pilot, The Olympiks, Beat Butcha, and Buda & Grandz among others. One track in particular that’s been getting a ton of attention these past 24 hours has been “Idols Become Rivals,” featuring Chris Rock. The track finds Rozay taking direct shots at Birdman for not paying his artists & producers, especially Lil Wayne, DJ Khaled & Mannie Fresh . He later came to Lil Wayne’s defense on Instagram Thursday afternoon, acknowledging he needed to say what everyone else had been thinking, which ultimately drew a response from Lil Wayne, saying “I Needed That.” “This album is more than just another project for me. It’s a product of strength, perseverance, and determination,” Ross wrote in an open letter. “Rather You Than Me is a testimony. My testimony, and if you a real nigga, no matter where you from, you can relate to this.” Available on iTunes , fans & bosses alike can now stream the 12-track project via Apple Music & Spotify (below).
