Oops!! \nRelated: Trump's Border Wall Keeps Crumbling Down… \nThe paper placed the photo right next to one of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and published the day's edition before ever realizing their BIG mistake — and while the news organization was quick and forceful in their sincere apology, it still made everyone laugh! \nHere's the pic, via Twitter , of the newspaper's erroneous page (below): \nHa!!! \nAnd the tweet that noticed it: \nDear El Nacional, Alec Baldwin will be pleased as punch. But let's hope the Dominican Republic isn't added to Trump's banned countries list pic.twitter.com/vt4NJe4NJf — Sharon Gibson (@SharonGibson3) February 10, 2017 \nToo crazy!! \nRelated: Trump Wants To Release Weekly Reports Of Crimes Committed By Immigrants \nAnd, per Variety , here's the translated apology from El Nacional about making the mistake in the first place: \n\"El Nacional published on Friday as Donald Trump a picture of actor Alec Baldwin, who imitates on a television program the president of the United States. \nThe picture was sent that day by Associated Press (AP) with the name of the actor and informed about the program, but it was placed as if it were the one of Trump, situation that happened unnoticed for all that reviewed page 19. \nEl Nacional apologizes to the readers and to all those who felt affected by the publication. Actor Baldwin imitates President Trump on the Saturday Night Live weekly show on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), one of the most important in the United States.\" \nWow! \nJust goes to show: (a) everybody makes mistakes, and (b) Baldwin's impression is getting REALLY good! \nAlso, like the tweet said, let's hope the Dominican Republic doesn't see negative fallout from Dictator Donald over this one!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:14:34.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
