She is also in the process of obtaining a security clearance and is set to receive government-issued communications devices this week. \nThat’s right, folks. The first daughter is getting all the perks of an official government employee, minus a salary… or the nuisance of being sworn in, any actual job responsibilities, or being legally accountable for anything. \nAccording to her attorney, Jamie Gorelick, Ivanka will serve as her dad’s “eyes and ears” by providing input on random things she has absolutely no knowledge about. \nSaid Gorelick, “Having an adult child of the president who is actively engaged in the work of the administration is new ground. Our view is that the conservative approach is for Ivanka to voluntarily comply with the rules that would apply if she were a government employee, even though she is not.” \nSo let’s get this straight… Americans are paying for Ivanka to be an official White House “volunteer” with security clearance and her own office, computer, cellphone, etc., but no official job title. On top of that, we’re just supposed to trust that she follows all the rules of a government employee, but if she doesn’t, there’s absolutely no way to hold her accountable. \nDo you find that incredibly irritating? Maybe these memes will help… If he ends up giving the 10 year old a job or a title, I will lose my mind.
