Related: Rams meet with head coach candidates Sean McVay and Harold Goodwin \nPer NFL.com’s Michael Silver, both teams were very impressed. Sean McVay has had two interviews (Rams, 49ers) and crushed them both. And my sources on this are not Sean McVay or his agent… \n— Michael Silver (@MikeSilver) January 9, 2017 \nMcVay has done a great job developing Kirk Cousins in Washington, which has undoubtedly played a major role in the Rams interest in him as a serious head coaching candidate. The Rams bet the house on Jared Goff when they traded up to draft him first overall in 2016, and so his success is paramount. Related: Washington offensive coordinator Sean McVay is a sleeper for Rams job \nIf McVay is some kind of young quarterback whisperer, he could be a game-changer for Los Angeles. In fact, if a barely 31-year-old is going to head coach any team, the very young Rams are probably the best fit in the NFL. \nOn the other hand, McVay would become the youngest head coach in the history of the league; and those who have previously earned that distinguished honor have not generally fared well. Related: Rams to interview Texans linebackers coach Mike Vrabel for head coach \nThe current record holder for the youngest NFL head coach ever hired was Lane Kiffin, who signed on with the Oakland Raiders when he was 31 years, 8 months old in 2007. He made it to 5-15 with the team before being fired after Week 4 of the 2008 season.
