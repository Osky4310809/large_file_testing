WATCH: New ISIS Video Shows Battles in Iraq & Executions Published Updated 8:37 am EST, October 29, 2016 7 Comments By S.J. Prince 5.8k Share Tweet Follow \nIn a new video purportedly put out by the Islamic State titled “Enduring Glory,” ISIS militants are shown conducting battle operations in Iraq and Syria, while residents of occupied cities are punished under sharia law. The video was released on ISIS terrorist channels on October 28. It comes from “Wilayat Raqqah,” the location of the Syrian ISIS “capital.” \nThe video comes on the heels of the American Coalition’s retaking of Mosul, the Iraqi “capital” of ISIS. Nearly two weeks ago, the American Coalition, consisting of the Iraqi Army, the Kurdish Peshmerga, Shia militias, Christian militias, and the Turkish Nineveh Guard, descended upon Mosul to free it from the Islamic State. The official operation began on October 17 when it was announced by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. \nISIS has been fighting a losing battle since. Diversionary tactics launched on other nearby cities like Kirkuk have failed. \nThe video tries to argue that despite setbacks endured by the Islamic State, it has “Enduring Glory.” \nThe video serves as a “best of” montage of ISIS throughout the Middle East, with militants shown engaging in battles across the region. \nSharia law enforcement is also shown, with various clips of beheadings, floggings, and executions intermixed throughout. \nSuicide bombers are also featured. \nHowever, despite ISIS grasping at straws, its imminent defeat may make the wartorn countries worse. The Washington Post reports: \nYet, even as eyes are riveted on reports from Mosul, Iraq, and elsewhere, there is little optimism — and certainly no euphoria — to be found here. Everyone knows that the weakening of the Islamic State is accompanied by the resurfacing, often in more potent ways, of past fault lines. The hyped and simplistic Sunni-Shia divide obscures complex ethnic, intertribal, regional and political dynamics that have been catalyzed by the U.S. invasion of Iraq and aggravated by state collapse. \nIt is also feared that ISIS may strengthen itself in other conflict zones that aren’t currently being focused on. \nThe New York Times reports that ISIS intends to make Sirte, a Mediterranean city in Libya, a back-up capital for the Islamic State in case Raqqa, Syria falls to the coalition. \nRecently, ISIS propaganda from Yemen has also been ramped up. \nHeavy is an independent news organization.
