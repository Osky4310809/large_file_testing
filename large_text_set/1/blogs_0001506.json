And we 100% get it. The barrage of updates from others, not to mention the temptation to create “perfect” versions of our lives via pics and posts, can just be exhausting. So when Anne Hathaway announced she’s taking a break from social media yesterday via her Instagram account , we totally got it.\nWhile social media has the capacity to provide so many benefits in our lives, the reality is it can sometimes make us less happy . It’s just so easy to dive down the rabbit hole of other people’s news feeds as opposed to connecting with the friends and family right in front of us. Not to mention how it can cause us to constantly compare ourselves to what we imagine other people’s lives are like — which is never a recipe for good times.\nThis was Hathaway’s specific post in which she revealed she would be taking a break. And we’re sending her a virtual high five. Hey all, Happy New Year! Let's keep it positive, people. I am grateful to 2016 for the birth of my son and all that has meant, for the lesson(s) that there are no guarantees and we should celebrate and delight in each other now and not later, and that within the greatest crisis always lay the path to achieving the greatest wisdom. 2016 was marked by many difficult moments and there were many corresponding reactions. As we go into a new year full of new opportunities, please remember that anger is a depot and not the train, so don't let it be your whole journey. Let's all trust deeper and love freer and light the way the best we are able into 2017. Love Light Peace xx PS- I wanted to let you know I am taking a pause from Instagram and Facebook. Until next we meet, \nA video posted by Anne Hathaway (@annehathaway) on Dec 31, 2016 at 3:04pm PST \n“PS- I wanted to let you know I am taking a pause from Instagram and Facebook. Until next we meet,” she wrote at the very end of her heartfelt message. Not to mention her beautiful reflections on the year at large:\n“As we go into a new year full of new opportunities, please remember that anger is a depot and not the train, so don’t let it be your whole journey. We couldn’t have said it any better ourselves, Anne. And while we don’t know Anne’s exact reasons for taking a breather, we support her decision to take a break from the whole social media game so hard.\nA photo posted by Anne Hathaway (@annehathaway) on Nov 17, 2016 at 9:18pm PST \nTake as much time away as you need.
