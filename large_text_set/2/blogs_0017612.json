For example, Uber hired Holder last year to advocate on its behalf to lawmakers regarding the use of fingerprints in the background check process. And Huffington, as previously noted, is a board member at the company. \n“This group is not set up to come up with an accurate analysis of the culture and a tough set of recommendations,” Kapor Klein and Kapor wrote. They went on to say they have a lot of respect for the parties involved in the investigation, but “none of that takes away the inherent conflicts that impede the necessary independence to make a deep and accurate assessment, which is where change must begin.” \nKapor Klein and Kapor say they are ready and willing to help Uber if it’s “indeed serious about a fundamental analysis and potential overhaul of every aspect of its policies, practices, complaint systems, training, upward communication systems, sentiment analysis, and commitment from the top.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:02:57.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
