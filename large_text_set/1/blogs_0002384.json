There is no room in this world for any kind of prejudice. My greatest hope is for inclusion and love for all humanity in 2017 and beyond.” \nTwo of the film’s stars, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae, also condemned Burrell’s sermon message. \n“ I unequivocally repudiate ANY AND ALL hateful comments against the LGBTQ community,” said Monae, who also is scheduled to appear on DeGeneres’ Thursday broadcast. “I will rejoice when folks stop thinking they ARE GOD, Jesus’ assistant, picking and choosing what “sins” are acceptable in the Bible, and using the Bible as a whip! WE can’t afford anymore tearing down of our shared humanity,” she said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:11:45.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
