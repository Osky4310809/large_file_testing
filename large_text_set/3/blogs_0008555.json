Bertish posted about his accomplishment on his official Instagram account: A photo posted by Chris Bertish (@chrisbertish) Bertish's journey took a total of 93 days and covered more than 4,000 miles. Per Jamie Grierson of the Guardian , Bertish was riding on a custom-made paddleboard that cost $120,000 and took six months to complete. \"Bertish paddled an average of 43 miles a day, beating his plan for 30 miles daily,\" Grierson wrote. \"He managed a gruelling 60 miles on the penultimate day to make the final push. He mostly travelled at night to avoid sun exposure and said he kept well-nourished with protein shakes, freeze-dried meals and salty jerky.\" CNN noted Bertish, in addition to being the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a solo paddleboard, also made history for the \" furthest distance traveled solo, unsupported and unassisted over open ocean in a day (71.96 miles).\" Bertish is a big-wave surfer and sailor who has set the standard for athletes in 2017 with the completion of his mission.
