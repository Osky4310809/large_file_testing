A native of Brazil, Sampaio is the first transgender person to appear on the magazine’s cover. Advertisement \nFrench Vogue did not make this decision haphazardly; rather, they have chosen to broadcast it. “Transgender beauty: How they’re shaking up the world,” reads the cover in bold white font. And they’ve selected the second biggest issue of the year to deliver this statement — only September surpasses March in terms of magnitude. \nFrench Vogue editor-in-chief Emmanuelle Alt tells American Vogue that they are spotlighting inequities based in gender presentation. “This cover is about the importance of [human] rights, and that we still need to make progress on an awful lot of stuff,” Alt says .

We’ve already taken far too long as it is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:34:05.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
