PCIJ \n  Bones of supposed Davao Death Squad (DDS) victims were removed from a dumping ground a week prior to the visit of the Commission on Human Rights in the area in 2009, self-confessed hitman Arthur Lascañas said Monday. \nMany DDS victims had allegedly been killed and buried in the quarry owned by retired cop Bienvenido Laud in Purok 3, Barangay Ma-a, Davao City. \nAt the Senate public order committee inquiry into extrajudicial killings, Lascañas said that some of the bones of the victims were dug up from the quarry and were thrown in a nearby lake. \nLIVE: Death squad 'leader' faces Senate panel \n\"Before nag-conduct si Commissioner (Leila) De Lima na mag-investigate sila sa quarry, siguro one week before or five days before may advanced info kami na magpunta doon so binigay kami ni mayor, particularly ni SPO4 Ben Laud ng pera para kung puwede mahukay 'yung nandoon,\" Lascañas told the Senate panel. \nLascañas added that the other bones were dumped at the outskirts of the Laud quarry.   \n\"'Yung ibang buto tinapon sa lake and according to Miguel, 'yung trusted aide ni Ben Laud, nilagay nila at the outskirts of Laud quarry, may isang hukay doon na dun nila tinambak 'yung buto,\" Lascañas said. \nIn his affidavit, Lascañas said that the remains of the Patasaja family were buried in the quarry. The family, including the wife, son, the wife's father, house maid and male helper were abducted by the group along with the patriarch. \nThe head of the Patasaja family was accused of being the mastermind of a kidnap for ransom case in Davao City. \n\"Their personal belongings were removed and burned, including the Quran of the wife. All the bodies were then loaded into two vehicles and brought deeper into the Laud quarry where Miguel and two other trusted men of SPO4 Laud stripped them naked before burying them,\" the affidavit read. \nIn 2014, the Supreme Court granted a search warrant on the Laud quarry the Philippine National Police has not searched the area. \nLaud had questioned the search warrant through his lawyer, Vitaliano Aguirre II, who is now Secretary of Justice, according to Free Legal Assistance Group lawyer Arno Sanidad. \nAguirre signed and filed for Laud before a Manila regional trial court way back in 2009. \nThe Commission on Human Rights led by now detained Sen. Leila de Lima in 2009 found human bones in examining the quarry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:46:36.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
