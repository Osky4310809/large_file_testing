For his acting skills, his ‘ideal boyfriend’ personality, and his amazing sense of humour. And for these reasons we have accepted him in all forms. Yes, by forms we mean his outrageous outfits! In fact we feel that he is only trying to motivate us to be as carefree and fun in life. Still, Ranveer Singh getting roasted for his sartorial choices is not a new affair. Every time he makes an appearance, his outfit is the most talked about thing on the Internet. And as brutal and humorous Twitter can get, it does. Recently, a picture of the Befikre actor, with SRK and Amitabh Bachchan, from 2016, started making rounds on the web. In the picture we see him wearing a striking red blazer and a ruffled white shirt. And, once again, his choice of clothes broke the Internet. The topic saw a funny debate amongst Twitteratis. While some compared him to the new iPhone 7 in Red, others thought he worked for the Kingfisher airlines.
