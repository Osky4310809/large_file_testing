I am so very sorry to hear that you had to experience… 1/4\n— Delta (@Delta) February 17, 2017 \n\n@MykkiBlanco …something like this on a Delta flight. Discrimination of any kind isn’t tolerated. We love ALL of our passengers…. 2/4\n— Delta (@Delta) February 17, 2017 \n\n@MykkiBlanco …Would you mind following me for a DM to explain in detail about what happened? I will also need your confirmation… 3/4\n— Delta (@Delta) February 17, 2017 \n\nHowever, Blanco only had one concrete request:\nI’m hoping that the cabin crew @Delta can come forward to provide proof that I slept through the entire flight https://t.co/HAewpQLVxc \n— mykki blanco (@MykkiBlanco) February 18, 2017 \n\nDelta needs to provide that necessary testimony.\n* Mykki Blanco was previously trans-identified, but in the most recent interview I could find, from February 6, 2017, identified as a gay man. (“In 2010 and 2011, I was going through a sexual exploration of myself and I was trans-identified. I identify as a gay man now, but at that time I was still exploring my sexuality and gender fluidity.”) I have therefore used he/him pronouns instead of they/them.\n(Via Jezebel and Pitchfork ; image via screengrab)\nWant more stories like this?
