Or at least, we thought it was. As it turns out, it’s possible for anyone to access your personal information from your locked phone . Yeah, it’s a pretty scary thought that could easily turn into your reality .\nThe iPhone offers two ways to set up your security . You can choose a four or six digit passcode, and/or you can use your fingerprints to make sure that you’re the only person accessing your phone. But according to one woman who happened to find someone else’s phone, passcodes don’t stop a stranger from finding out all kinds of personal information.\nTwitter user uninterested hō explained what happened in a series of tweets, and TBH, it’s pretty scary. \nthis girl left her phone in the bathroom today. when I tried to give it back, I learned something.\n\niphone users (esp women) please read https://t.co/hMDB7NFf28 \n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 I asked siri what's my name. it pulled up her info. cool. I asked siri who do I call most. pulled up her recent calls. cool.\n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 I was about to call the most recent person but they called me first. I answer. the girl comes right back to get her phone. hooray. all good.\n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 She’s clearly a good human and gave the girl her phone back, but she realized something pretty scary in the process. Even when the phone was locked, she had access to the notifications and was able to ask Siri questions. She found the girl’s first and last name, where she lives, and even where her car was parked. Yikes!\nit was that easy. all from a locked phone. I could've got directions to her car and her home. that shit scared me.\n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 idk if it's just me, but it's scary to know that anyone can find this info about me all from me leaving my phone in the bathroom for 5mins\n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 It’s unnerving to know that literally anyone could have access to that much personal information. Though, the good news is that there’s a way to change your settings so all of that info isn’t accessible without your passcode or fingerprint.\ngo to settings, touch id & passcode, and under \"allow access when locked\" turn off siri, today's view, and notification's view.\n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 We’re thankful to uninterested hō (whose real name we obviously don’t know) for bringing this to our attention. It only takes a few seconds to do, and it could prevent a major security issue for you down the road if you ever lose your phone (let’s be real — it’s happened to the best of us).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:55:36.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
