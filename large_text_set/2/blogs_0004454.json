Jews and Christians surrounded the highly-regarded Islamic centre in a show of support for the Muslim community following Sunday’s deadly attack at a Quebec City mosque.\nRelated Toronto man who has been de-radicalizing Canadian terrorists being deported to the U.S. “I was not aware of who he was or what his background was. That’s obviously not something I condone in any way shape or form,” Levitt said later, adding Pippin had not raised his deportation case with the MP.\nPippin said he likewise did not know he was posing with a Toronto MP. “I didn’t even know who he was,” said the U.S. citizen, who is still hoping the government will allow him to stay in Canada.\nAt the age of 18, Pippin traveled to Pakistan “to engage in jihad,” according to the IRB. “He wanted to protect Muslims who were being victimized by Indian authorities. This idealistic goal, however, required him to potentially kill Indian soldiers.”\nJoining @holyblossom Rabbi & #Jewish community members forming a #RingOfPeace in support of our #Muslim neighbours. #yorkcentre #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/0KZOnPBki4 \n— Michael Levitt, MP (@LevittMichael) February 3, 2017 \n\nSince then he has abandoned extremism, testified as a prosecution witness at a U.S. terrorism trial and helped de-radicalize two former members of the terror group that plotted to bomb downtown Toronto in 2006. \nHe denied ever being a member of the LeT, which in 2008 conducted the deadly Mumbai terrorist attack. The IRB, however, ruled he was “fully committed to the group” and was willing to risk his life fighting Indian forces. \nLevitt said the incident should not detract from Friday’s goodwill. “It doesn’t change the fact that this is an important event to be happening across the city. And neighbours coming together with neighbours is important and I wouldn’t want that to derail this.”\n• Email: sbell@postmedia.com | Twitter: StewartBellNP \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:25:54.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
