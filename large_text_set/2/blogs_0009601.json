Boris Johnson Credit: Getty \nT he money will not be spent on weapons but instead will combat extremism, particularly cyber warfare. \nMr Johnson is reportedly behind the new fund, which follows intense criticism of the way the British aid budget is spent. \nIn December the foreign secretary said: \"\"We have the cult of the strong man. We have democracy in retreat. \n\"We need to redouble our resolve and defend and preserve the best of the rules based international order.\" Priti Patel is the aid secretary Credit: Andrew Parsons \n\nT he scheme is seen as a way to help boost the UK's global influence in the wake of Brexit, a Whitehall source told the newspaper. \nThe Foreign Office did not comment on the report.
