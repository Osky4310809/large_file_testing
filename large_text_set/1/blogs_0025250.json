In November, she came out as bisexual and wrote a note to Trump voters, part of which read, \nTo every single Trump supporter… Your words are worthless, because your actions have led to the single-handed destruction of all the progress we’ve made socially as a nation. \nOn January 21, she also took part of the Women’s March on Washington. She told Nylon , \nI’m marching for human rights in general, because the upcoming administration has clearly made a statement about who they support and what kind of regime they intend to instill. I’m marching for women, I’m marching for the LGBT community, I’m marching for immigrants. I happen to fall into all three categories, so I’m marching for myself at the end of the day and for my family and my friends. And for whoever else deserves it. Instagram \nJauregui wrote an open letter, obtained by People , asking fans to “take action.” \nShe began, \nRaise your hand if you are an immigrant, or the sons and daughters of immigrant parents, or the grandchildren of immigrants, or the great-grandchildren, or great-great-grandchildren? Wait…are everyone’s hands up—including yours, Mr. Trump—except for the Indigenous people of the Americas?! Because they should be. \nLauren goes on to explain how Spanish conquistadors murdered and enslaved indigenous people in 1492 and how it happened again in 1620 by European Christian separatists. \nShe continued, \nThis country was built and continues to survive off the backs of immigrants and refugees. The term refugee in itself is such a significant word. These people are not terrorists: Many are escaping wars that we created in their lands. To tell another human being that the disastrous tortures of war are not important and to then go even a step further and insult their plight for freedom by labeling them ‘terrorists’ is just disrespectful to humanity. \nShe finished, \nIf you are going to these protests, if you need health insurance for yourself or a sick loved one, if you are a woman, if you are a person of color, if you are disabled, if you practice any sort of religion, if you care about the air you breathe and the water you drink, if you showed up to that women’s march in whatever city or state or country or town you came from, you need to fight back. We need to come together and let this administration know that we are not going to stand for another Nazi Germany or Stalin Russia or Mao Zedong China. The list is endless in the course of history, and it all happens the exact same way. The phrase history repeats itself is not a cliché for free. \nPlease heed the danger and the warning and blessing that we still live in a country where the founding principles that these Republicans swear to uphold are still protected by some… Please, please listen. \nYou can read her letter in its entirety here .
