One side read, \"Trump Trumps. Bannon Bans. Conway Cons,\" -- a reference to Trump's inner circle -- while the other side read, \"America, urine danger\" -- a reference to the more salacious claims made in the unsubstantiated Russian dossier Trump has denied. \nSee signs from 'Not My President's Day' protests \n\nOther protesters' displayed signs with messages that attacked Trump's controversial executive orders, such as the pipeline executive order reviving the Dakota Access pipeline , with texts including \"Resist,\" \"Revolt,\" and \"Lock him up\" -- a spin on the anti-Hillary Clinton \"Lock her up!\" chant that was popular at Trump's campaign rallies.\nWhether written or spoke, many attendees at the rally had harsh words for Trump.\nNew York resident Colin Robinson, 24, told AOL News he joined the rally Monday because he disagrees with Trump's immigration policy and travel ban.\n\"Trump's immigration policy and cooperation he has from immigration enforcement -- here in New York City, especially -- [is] the thing that's on the top of my mind right now,\" Robinson said. \"He's ruining lives [and] hurting people. People are going to die.\"\nMonday's rallies arrived amid what has been a flurry of protests from liberal grassroots groups following Trump's entrance into the White House, starting with the Women's March on Washington -- what its organizers intended to be \"a bold message\" to the new administration -- the day after Trump's inauguration. Opposition has also been voiced on a wide range of issues, including immigration and climate change.\nEmily Lewis, 27, another rally attendee, told AOL News that her goals are \"to improve the voting process so that everyone can have representation that actually suits their neighborhood. I want to support nonprofits and the political parties that are in favor of fixing gerrymandering.\"\nSee Twitter reactions to 'Not My President's Day' protests \n\nJanilla Perez, 19, who was one of about 20 members of Movimiento Cosecha -- a group fighting for the permanent protection of undocumented immigrants nationwide -- said her group attended to the rally to show support and spread awareness about their nonviolent movement.\n\"We're just trying to raise awareness and we're really fighting to show the economic impact that immigrants have on this country because we do basically support this economy,\" Perez said. \"We want to show the country that without us this country wouldn't really run as well as it does.\"\nSEE ALSO: Women's March protesters get creative with signs, call out Trump administration \nShe also disagrees with the president's views on immigration.\n\"I don't agree with any of his policies,\" Perez continued. \"The fact that he's purposely putting people against each other and he's using racism and xenophobia as his tactics [is] really upsetting and that's not what this country stands for.\"\nSister rallies of the \"Not My President's Day\" rally in NYC were staged in dozens of other cities including Chicago, Washington D.C., Philadelphia and Atlanta to denounce Donald Trump's presidency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:25:54.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
