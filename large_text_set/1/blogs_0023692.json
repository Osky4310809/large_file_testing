(Photo: ITV) (Photo: ITV) \nSome fans were baffled by Nick's choice of destination, while others were more interested in the name of the search engine. \n\"@itvcorrie is Voggle real?,\" joked one viewer. Another quipped: \"Ah yes Nick, that well known search engine, Voggle.\" \nEven Corrie seemed to get in on the joke, tweeting: \"We're just going to #Voggle how many people have never heard of Weatherfield's number one search engine before!\" (Photo: ITV) (Photo: ITV) \nViewers weren't entirely surprised that Nick was thinking of leaving Weatherfield after it was revealed Ben was leaving the soap. \nThe actor, who quit to spend more time with his family said, said: “Coronation Street has been the most significant part of my career and I have had a fantastic seven years here. \n\"The decision to leave is purely personal - I want to be able to spend more time with my family. \n\"I have been supported by a terrific cast and crew and have had the most glorious storylines and for that I am most grateful.” \nNewcastle-born Ben, 45, commutes to work in Manchester from his home in London, where he lives with his wife Alexandra and two children Paloma, 10, and seven-year-old Max.
