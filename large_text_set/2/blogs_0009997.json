Close Banana Girl’s ex lashes out at driver who overtook the cyclist dangerously on narrow ride UP NEXT VIDEO Banana Girl’s ex lashes out at driver who overtook the cyclist dangerously on narrow ride Source: Youtube/ Velo Vegan Banana Girl’s ex lashes out at driver who overtook the cyclist dangerously on narrow ride \nA YouTube clip posted on Sunday shows Johnstone riding along a narrow road at Adelaide’s Norton Summit, when a motorist appears to overtake him across unbroken lines. \nAfter being signalled by Johnstone, the driver pulled over ahead, only to be confronted by the raging cyclist who screamed at him in an expletive-laden rant, claiming he passed too close. Footage shows cyclist Harley Johnstone appearing to be overtaken on a narrow road by a motorist passing over unbroken lines.

Picture: Durianrider/YouTube \n“F**king car, you want to kill me mate, you want to kill me?” Johnstone, known as Durianrider on social media, accused the driver. \n“I'm here, kill me, man,” he yelled, gesturing with his hands. \nIn attempt to diffuse the cyclist’s rage, the driver asked Johnstone “why are you so upset?' \n“Because my f**king mate got killed in the city by a f**king car driver like you, he f**king hit his head, man,” he shouted. \n“Every f**king day car drivers come too close. One day someone's gonna f**king kill me. If you want to kill me, I'm f**king here, bro.” Ex-partner of popular Aussie vegan blogger claims she was 'abusive' \nThe motorist calmly explained he often drove safely near cyclists by slowing right down. \n“You've got too much adrenaline running,” he accused Johnstone, before asking if he wanted to go to jail. \n“I've already been to jail, bro, I ain't afraid of going back,” he responded. \nThe motorist drives away to avoid further confrontation. Harley Johnstone split with social media identity Leanne Ratcliffe AKA Freelee the Banana Girl in September before accusing the woman of physical abuse. Picture: 7 News \nThe video shared on Sunday, with the blurb “Dangerous driver passing illegally and at reckless manner then pulls over to confront cyclists” received mixed responses from social media users. \nSome defended the Adelaide personal trainer’s outburst, while others said his hot head did not help his cause. \n“That type of language isn't going to help the situation, no need to be that aggressive,” one viewer commented. \n“I hate road rage and most of the time cyclists just have to deal with it, not worth getting into a situation like you did and maybe loose [sic] a bunch of teeth, maybe a broken jaw or nose!” \nAnother wrote: “Sounds like a mouthy bogan.” \nA third YouTuber defended Johnstone, saying there was “nothing wrong with what he's doing. he's expressing his anger. he's not hurting anyone. HE WAS ALMOST STRUCK BY A CAR!! HELLO?!” The couple during their seven-year relationship. Picture: Facebook \n“I'm a high carb, plant-based vegan cyclist who gives no f***s about saying what needs to be said,” is the blogger's philosophy, according to his website. \n“Stand up for what you believe in, or sit the fruit back down!” \nJohnstone last September made headlines for posting a YouTube video claiming Banana Girl Leanne Ratcliffe, who eats up to 51 bananas a day, was \"abusive\" to him during their relationship, which Ratcliffe later denied.
