Her husband, Scott Kegelman, realized she was gone after waiting in line to pick up her medication. \nKegelman frantically drove around the neighborhood looking for Gilbert before contacting the NYPD. \nOfficials released her photo to the public during the weekend and she was found in St. Barnabus Hospital Wednesday afternoon. \nIt was not immediately clear how she ended up in The Bronx. \nKegelman described Gilbert as a “firebrand” who loves motorcycles and dedicated much of her life to improving conditions for patients at local hospitals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:48:13.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
