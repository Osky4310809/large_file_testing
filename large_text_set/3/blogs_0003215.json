Kelechi Iheanacho scored the fifth in extra time. \nHere are David McDonnell's complete player ratings: Leroy Sane scores Man City's first goal (Photo: REUTERS) Manchester City \nCalamity keeper struck again, allowing the ball through his legs for the opener. \nZabaleta 6 \nFailed to intercept ball in build-up to opener.

Made amends by winning penalty for second goal.
