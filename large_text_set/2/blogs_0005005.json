It seems Neiman Marcus might be dropping Ivanka Trump's label. As first reported by Racked , jewelry from the First Daughter's fashion line has disappeared from the department store’s website this morning. The label is also missing from the retailer's master list of partner brands.

Based on productivity, we continuously assess whether our brands are carried in stores, on our website, or both.\" The retailer did not specifically state whether or not it'll officially drop the Trump-owned line, but at the moment, does not carry of the brand's products online. The development followed an announcement from Nordstrom on Thursday, regarding its decision to break with Ms. Trump's brand . In a statement, the Seattle-based retailer said it dropped the line due to poor brand performance. The retailer—along with Neiman Marcus—is one of the top ten companies that have been targeted by the #GrabYourWallet campaign, which calls for a boycott of retailers that carry Ivanka Trump or Trump-affiliated merchandise. Led by Shannon Coulter and Sue Atencio, the movement began in October after The Washington Post released a video from 2005 that showed Donald Trump boasting about groping women without consent. According to Racked , Coulter told the fashion news site that there were 21 products for sale on the Neiman Marcus website earlier this week, but now all the items have been taken down. Coulter's boycott list includes other major department stores, including Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, and Lord & Taylor. It lists out the products each retailer keeps in its inventory, as well as contact information to the corporate and press departments. We've reached out to representatives of the Ivanka Trump line, and will update this post accordingly.
