The funds were to be invested in infrastructure, energy, healthcare and education. The law drew comparisons to the New Deal and, accordingly, very little support from Congressional Republicans. \nThey were not the only ones who were wary. The electorate, having just watched the reckless bankers responsible for tanking the economy receive bailouts and no jail terms, wanted reassurance, so the government set up recovery.org to track the billions. The site is no longer available. \nFriday marks the eight-year anniversary of the American Recovery Act. How has the economy fared since? \nGrowth has certainly picked up. Real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) was contracting at an 8.2% annualized rate at the end of 2008. The return to growth was not immediate, and it remains low by previous decades' standards, but the final three months of 2016 probably (the Bureau of Economic Analysis has only released its first estimate) mark the eleventh-straight quarter of growth. \nFor investors, the results have been hard to beat. The stock market continued to fall into early March 2009, when the S&P 500 hit a vaguely sinister low of 666.79. Since then it has soared 252% to close at 2,347.22 on February 16. The Dow is up as well, but that's hardly worth mentioning . \nAs the Recovery Act's price tag indicates, these returns did not come cheaply. The national debt grew by 95% from the end of fiscal 2008 to the end of fiscal 2016. At the time of writing, it is itching to whir past the $20.0 trillion mark. (See also, The National Debt Explained . ) \nThe French finance minister and later president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing famously said in the 1960s that the U.S.'s ability to take on such mountains of debt without collapsing was an \"exorbitant privilege.\" In this case the government had some help from the Federal Reserve , which printed around $4.5 trillion in money to buy a large portion of the Treasury's debt. \nThis once-unconventional, now ubiquitous, monetary policy approach is known as quantitative easing , and it is intended to grow the money supply and impart some vim to the economy. Critics worried that it would spur inflation – as printing money often does – but so far the Fed's preferred measure, core (ex-food and -fuel) PCE remains below target, though it's rising. (See also, With Trump, Bond Bubble Is Out, Inflation Is In . ) \nSkeptics might balk at the approach so far: Looking at GDP growth can be misleading, since there's no indication of who exactly is benefiting from the growth. According to UC Berkeley's Emmanuel Saez, the top 1% of earners captured 58% of income growth from 2009 to 2014. Looking at stock market returns – which the Fed's bond-buying helped along by depressing Treasury yields – only reinforces that notion. \nBut the richest did not completely hijack the recovery. The unemployment rate has fallen by more than half since its post-crisis peak. \nOn the other hand critics, including President Donald Trump , allege that this rate (U-3) is misleading. It only includes those who are actively looking for work in the labor force, so the discouraged and disabled do not factor into the rate. Nor does it account for those who are working part time but would prefer to work full time. The more comprehensive U-6 rate accounts for these things, and it stood at 9.4% in January. That's down from a peak of 17.1% in April 2010, but the decline has not kept pace with the fall in the U-3. \nReal median household income finally recovered its 2008 level in 2015, when it hit $56,516, but it remains below the level in 1999 ($57,909). \nIn general, the economy appears to be in decent health. But if that's the case, why all the anxiety? Part of the answer lies in the smaller-scale trends that national statistics hide. Manufacturing jobs, for example, have not regained their pre-crisis levels. And they may not. Trade has impacted the sector, and Trump's trade policies could conceivably help it to take back some ground, but the larger problem is automation: Even as manufacturing employment has dropped, the U.S.'s manufacturing output has risen. The reason is that machines have taken on a much greater role in production. (See also, NAFTA's Winners and Losers . ) \nFinally, certain groups have seen their clout fall steeply in the past eight years. White men, who started from a high base, have been dropping out of the labor force for decades, and the financial crisis only accelerated the process. The group that voted most overwhelmingly for Trump still enjoys social advantages (when the country was founded they were the only ones who could vote), but the ability to take on dignified work that can service a mortgage right out of high school has all but vanished. If the 3.7 percentage point drop in participation since January 2009 seems steep, consider the decline since January 1954, when 87.9% of white males aged 20 or over were employed: 15.8 percentage points. (See also, Economic Anxiety and the Crisis of Masculinity . ) \nCan these developments all be pinned on the Recovery Act, or even Obama's legacy more generally? Certainly not, but it's worth reflecting on how far the country has come since this date eight years ago: The U.S. has returned to consistent growth, revived capital markets and reduced unemployment. It's also worth considering what the recovery cost – $800 billion or so for this specific measure, but trillions altogether, with implications for future growth – and who it left behind.
