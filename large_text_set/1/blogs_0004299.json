What Is Epiphany? \nEpiphany, also known as \"Three Kings Day\" and \"Twelfth Day,\" is a Christian holiday commemorated on January 6. It falls on the twelfth day after Christmas, and for some denominations signals the conclusion of the Christmas season. (The 12 days between Christmas and Epiphany are known as the “Twelve Days of Christmas.”) \nThough many different cultural and denominational customs are practiced, in general, the feast celebrates the manifestation of God to the world in the form of human flesh through Jesus Christ , his Son. \nThe word epiphany means \"appearance,\" “manifestation,” or “revelation\" and is commonly linked in Western Christianity with the visit of the wise men (Magi) to the Christ child (Matthew 2:1-12). Through the Magi, Christ revealed himself to the gentiles. In Eastern Christianity, Epiphany puts emphasis on the baptism of Jesus by John (Matthew 3:13-17; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22), with Christ revealing himself to the world as God's own Son. Likewise, on Epiphany some denominations commemorate Jesus' first miracle of turning water into wine at the Wedding in Cana (John 2:1-11), signifying the manifestation of Christ's divinity as well. \nIn the early days of church history before Christmas was observed, Epiphany celebrated both the birth of Jesus and his baptism. Unique Cultural Celebrations of Epiphany \nIf you were fortunate enough to have grown up in a town such as Tarpon Springs, Florida, where I attended high school, then you are probably quite familiar with some of the unique cultural celebrations associated with Epiphany . What I remember vividly about this ancient church holiday is skipping school each year on Epiphany to see many of my classmates (young men ages 16-18 of the Greek Orthodox faith ) dive into the chilly waters of Spring Bayou to retrieve the cherished cross. \nThe \"blessing of waters\" and \"diving for the cross\" ceremonies were famous in our predominately Greek community, and that fame was shared for a year by one special Greek classmate who had the honor of recovering the crucifix and receiving the traditional full-year's blessing. \nAfter more than 100 years of celebrating this tradition, the annual Greek Orthodox festival in Tarpon Springs continues to draw large crowds. Unfortunately, many observers do not understand the true meaning behind these Epiphany ceremonies. \nToday in Europe, Epiphany celebrations are sometimes just as important as Christmas, with celebrants exchanging gifts on Epiphany instead of Christmas, or on both holidays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:14:51.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
