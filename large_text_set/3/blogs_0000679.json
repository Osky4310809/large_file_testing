Someone with a solid brand. Someone…like the Queen. \nAnd now you can. \nBecause her Majesty is now recruiting for a seasoned social media user to run her personal Twitter account. \nThe job vacancy, which has been posted on her official website says that she’s looking for a new ‘digital communications officer’ to join her ‘fast-paced’ team. \nIt’s a full-time role which is offering £30,000 a year and will involve the running of the royal Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube channels. \nYour job will be to write posts about her work – documenting state visits, award ceremonies and various Royal engagements. \n‘It’s knowing your content will be viewed by millions,’ the advert says. \n‘It’s finding new ways to maintain The Queen’s presence in the public eye and on the world stage. \n‘This is what makes working for the Royal Household exceptional.’ \nThe post, which is a maternity cover role, says that the biggest reward that it offers is the knowledge of having your work shared around the world. \nThe Queen has only ever tweeted once, back in 2014 when she wrote about the opening of an exhibition at the London Science Museum. \nIt read: ‘It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I hope people will enjoy visiting. Elizabeth R.’ \nTo apply, just visit the Royal Household’s website . \nSo…what are you waiting for? \nSource: Mirror", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:21:36.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
