As much as I was disappointed that I wasn't playing, I was in the front row to see the amusing antics along on the touchline,\" said Begovic. \n\"The coaches clashed, they shouted at each other, it was a very intense match. It was really unnecessary, but it was so funny, because I worked so hard not to laugh. Every time the camera came across, we thought to ourselves 'be serious, don't get caught laughing'. \nMourinho: Modern players are brats! \n\"It was unprofessional, and I thought it was a little too much. They had a fight, it was a big deal and I don't think we like to see that.\" \nThe two sides meet again at Old Trafford on 16 April in the Premier League, a week before Chelsea face Tottenham in their FA Cup semi-final tie.
