He lied again, and debased and denigrated Ms. Zervos with false statements about her.\" \nTrump previously threatened to sue the numerous women who came forward with stories of inappropriate sexual comments and contact during the lead up to the 2016 election. Now, Zervos's suit will call on the soon-to-be-president to either admit her story is true and apologize, or head to court to defend his claim that Zervos is a \"phony.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:41:41.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
