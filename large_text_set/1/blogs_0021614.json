The result of that is Furnace , a collection of ten songs that capture the intense emotional turmoil that happens when a relationship you built a life around is suddenly different, or gone completely. His folky singer/songwriter inflection coupled with a few moments that are downright ambient really lend itself to the subject matter of the album. It feels like the kind of album you would write if you went through a hell of a lot more than you initially thought you were in for. \nHe didn't set out to write an album about such deeply personal experiences. \"Creatively it's not what I was trying to do but it's what happened and it's what came out,\" Simonett told me when I asked him his approach to writing the album. In fact at the outset, he made it a point to not write about it. But as it stands, isolation often amplifies the very thing you're trying to avoid, he found that no matter what, he somehow ended up writing about it anyway. \nYou can listen to it below. Furnace is out January 27, via GNDWIRE/Thirty Tigers.
