Use these to impress your friends over the weekend. \nThere's a lot we don't know about our favorite candies. Where did it get it's name? What is it made out of? What flavor are the yellow ones supposed to be? But with these fun facts about your favorite red rope-like and vaguely fruity candy, you'll never have to wonder about what you're munching on again. Here are five facts about Red Vines! They've Been Around for a While \n(source) \nThe American Licorice Company, which makes Red Vines, was started in 1914 in Chicago. In 1920, the American Licorice Company introduced Raspberry Vines, AKA Red Vines' granddaddy. In 1952, the recipe was tweaked and the candy was renamed Red Vines. And since candy never seems to have an expiration date, the original batch of Red Vines might still be good! They're Not Licorice \nEven though Red Vines are called red licorice and are manufactured by the American Licorice Company, the candy contains no actual licorice. I repeat, Red Vines contain no actual licorice. Have we been living a lie this whole time???? Black Red Vines Were Recalled \nRed Vine's black licorice candy was recalled in August 2012 by the California Department of Public Health due to lead contamination. The candy contained 13.2 micrograms of lead per serving, which is more than double the amount of lead that's safe for a kid under six to ingest. Peanut butter and chocolate make sense together. Lead and licorice don't! They've Gone Hollywood, Baby! \n(source) \nRed Vines aren't just the candy you eat at the movies, sometimes they're in the movies. Red Vines have been featured so prominently in Fox sci-fi drama Fringe that Joshua Jackson even sent Red Vines to Fox as an attempt to get the network to renew the series. But the real question is, has anyone written a Red Vines fan fic yet? They're Popular \nThink Red Vines are a second-rate version of Twizzlers? Think again! They're currently the number one non-chocolate candy in the entire United States. Sorry, Skittles! Red Vines reign supreme. \nWhat's your favorite candy?
