But some believe the so-called “ Weeping Angel ” operation was named for one of the Doctor’s most frightening foes.\nAccording to the document—which bears the CIA crest and calls the operation “secret”—Weeping Angel was discussed during a joint workshop with the UK’s MI5/BTSS (British Security Service) in June 2014.\n“The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation” with the British government, WikiLeaks said in an analysis of the documents.\nAnd while US and UK intelligence agencies insist code names are randomly chosen by a computer, not based on personal pop culture preferences, it’s hard to believe this particular title wasn’t at least influenced by the long-running BBC sci-fi show.\nKnown as “The Lonely Assassins,” Doctor Who ‘s Weeping Angels are quantum-locked alien killers: The innocuous-looking statues freeze when observed, but move lickety-split in the blink of an eye. One touch and you’re flung back in time, allowing the Angel to feed on the energy of your unlived days.\nThe beautiful-if-ghastly creatures first appeared in the 2007 episode “Blink,” featuring Carey Mulligan as Sally Sparrow, who must follow the Tenth Doctor’s cryptic clues to trap the Weeping Angels and release the TARDIS.\nPerhaps the CIA recognized some latent similarities between the stone-cold monsters and their surveillance program. Or maybe someone in the agency’s IT department a huge Doctor Who fan.\nOther found document labels include Brutal Kangaroo, Fine Dining, Cutthroat and Swindle, HammerDrill, and HarpyEagle.\nStream all of Doctor Who now for free with your Amazon Prime membership.", "external_links": ["http://r.zdbb.net/u/2ajh", "http://r.zdbb.net/u/27gy?or=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geek.com%2Ftelevision%2Fdoctor-who-underrated-villain-of-the-week-lady-cassandra-1689135%2F", "http://www.pcmag.com/news/352229/wikileaks-trove-appears-to-show-cia-hacking-tools", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByPrDPbdRhc?feature=oembed?wmode=transparent", "http://www.recode.net/2017/3/7/14846926/cia-code-names-surveillance-wikileaks", "https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_12353643.html"], "published": "2017-03-09T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:58:50.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
