One of our fave leading ladies, Maisie Williams, was in attendance at the 2017 Brit Awards and her dress was pure perfection. Williams chose an outfit that made her look like the dancer emoji’s identical twin. \nThe 19-year-old “Game of Thrones” star arrived wearing a gorgeous red gown that looked super comfortable. We’re all for fashion that doesn’t make us count down the seconds until we can get home and breathe again.\nBut, her gown had her looking like a close resemblance to one of our favorite emoji’s too — the dancer! The star posted a photo to Instagram, and her pose was total #twinning.

That, paired with her chin-length brown hair, and her adorable smile, she was an exact double.\nShe captioned the photo, “Lemme do the thing like the emoji” .”\nDavid M.
