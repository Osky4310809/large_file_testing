After all, he's not the king of hearts for nothing. And this recent story about how he treated his employees for Valentine's Day, has made us wish we were part of his team, too! According to DNA , on the occasion of Valentine's Day, the female employees at SRK's production company, Red Chillies, walked into office to find an array of presents laid out for them. Each woman on the team received roses, a designer handbag and a smartphone, and we're sure they must have been ecstatic. Most of the people who work in his team have been with him for years, and so we're guessing they he thought they needed a treat. What a sweet gesture, right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:28:42.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
