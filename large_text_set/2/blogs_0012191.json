It was amazing.\n“I had so much confidence, got into a relationship. I got pregnant and I was happy.\n“But unfortunately I had a miscarriage and I’m no longer in a relationship.\n“Since I found out I had Cutis Laxa, I have literally done nothing about it. The last time I saw a doctor was in Texas, which isn’t good.\n“My health does worry me, but only when I think about it. Most of the time I’m oblivious to it, which isn’t a good thing.”\nZara Hartshorn after her facelift surgery Ruaridh Connellan / Barcroft Images However, Zara is determined to live her life like a normal 20-year-old, despite still fearing meeting new people.\nShe said: “My facelift has dropped, especially when I smile and I don’t like it. It’s horrible, it makes me feel old.\n“But I’m 20, I want to have fun. I want to be 20 and act 20.”\nEventually, Zara’s health began starting to deteriorate but she has finally found the courage to contact Dr Zsolt Urban who has been studying the condition.\nSpeaking to the doctor online, she was told some devastating news – Curtis Laxa could cause her heart to fail at anytime.\nShe said: “It is actually a serious illness and I’m disregarding it like it’s not even serious. I’m terrified.”\nRealising she’d been living in denial, Zara made the brave decision to have a thorough heart scan. Fortunately, tests showed that Zara’s heart was fine.\nShe said: “I’m buzzing. I’m not going to die.”\nAcceptance of her condition has made Zara turn a new corner and she’s determined to use it to help others.\nShe said: “In all honesty, I don’t blame anyone for this illness. As daft as it sounds, everyone’s born the way they are for a reason and there is a reason I am the way I am.\n“For me, the future is about trying to help as many people as possible that have got the same condition as me.\n“I would like to inspire and try to help and reach out to those people that are scared to come forward and admit to the world that they have got this illness.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:44:50.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
