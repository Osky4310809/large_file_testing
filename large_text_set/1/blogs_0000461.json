Missing Broomfield woman found dead in SUV in Denver \nThe play remains in a haze for Zaire Anderson, his head-first slam into a teammate chasing down a punt return. But the Broncos’ linebacker escaped a scary moment that led to an immediate exit from Sunday’s game against the Raiders and a trip to the hospital. \n“All I remember is trying to get up and I couldn’t,” Anderson said Monday. He flew head-first into the right hip of Quentin Gause in the third quarter, then stayed face-down for several minutes without moving. \nAnderson was strapped to a backboard and carted off the field, then loaded into an ambulance. After he regained feeling and movement in his arms and legs, he was released from the hospital Sunday night. Tests came back normal. \nAnderson said he suffered a concussion of the spinal cord.

It was a shock.” \nVon wants his sack attack back. Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller won’t have his head coach back next season, but he does want his fellow pass-rusher to return. Demarcus Ware, who underwent back surgery last week to repair a ruptured disc, was in the final year of his contract with the Broncos. \n“He’s still a Ferrari,” Miller said. “He just has to get some new breaks on there. He still has gas in the tank and still has a supercharged V8 engine. I’ve seen it every day.” \nMiller, meanwhile, will likely get consideration in the Associated Press defensive player of the year voting. \n“That’s up to you guys,” Miller said. “I put in a heck of a resume. In the second grade, when you’re voting for class president, I never voted for myself.” \nBacks in flux. Rookie running back Devontae Booker, who rushed for two touchdowns Sunday, finally found some footing in the Broncos backfield. Just in time to see it slip away. \n“I’m about to be on my second coach already,” Booker said. Gary Kubiak , who retired as Broncos coach Monday, helped draft Booker in the fourth round last year. But after starting running back C.J. Anderson suffered a season-ending knee injury in October, the Broncos struggled to regain a run game. \nBooker ran for 57 yards against the Raiders, his highest output since Nov. 27. But Justin Forsett, the veteran running back signed by the Broncos in December, got a bulk of the carries, rushing 22 times for a game-high 90 yards, including a 64-yard run up the middle in the second quarter. \nThe future hierarchy in the Broncos backfield may change after Anderson returns, but Booker said he will be ready. \n“I’ll be more prepared,” he said. “I know what I’m capable of. There’s just something for me in the offseason to go on with that mindset to come back just ready to dominate.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T03:39:13.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
