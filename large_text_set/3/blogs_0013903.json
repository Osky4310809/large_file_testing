It has a very big, epic sound, and I think that's another part of our particular sound - this large, cinematic, symphonic sound. \n\"'Metropolis' is one of the first songs where we did that. As soon as we started, it had this big, glorious feeling to it. It's a good example of combining metal - this sort of tight Metallica-ish riff - but then it goes off, the whole middle section is just kinda whacky, it doesn't make any sense. \n\"That's exactly what I was talking about before [regarding the essence of progressive music] - you can break the rules and do whatever you want, go crazy for three minutes and then come back to the song. I think it has all of the elements that make us who we are, it has everything in it.\" \nAsked about the trickiest tune to play on the entire album, the guitarist replied: \n\"Probably ' Under a Glass Moon .' It's pretty hard, more uptempo, there's a crazy guitar solo in it... It's fun, but that would be one of the harder ones.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T13:55:59.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
