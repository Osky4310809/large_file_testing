Split did particularly well in star James McAvoy’s home country of the United Kingdom, earning $3.1 million. \nIn xXx: Return of Xander Cage , after coming out of self-imposed exile, daredevil operative Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) must race against time to recover a sinister weapon known as Pandora's Box, a device that controls every military satellite in the world. Recruiting a new group of thrill-seeking cohorts, Xander finds himself entangled in a deadly conspiracy that points to collusion at the highest levels of government. \nIn Split , though Kevin (James McAvoy) has evidenced 23 personalities to his trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), there remains one still submerged who is set to materialize and dominate all of the others. Compelled to abduct three teenage girls led by the willful, observant Casey, Kevin reaches a war for survival among all of those contained within him -- as well as everyone around him -- as the walls between his compartments shatter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T22:05:09.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
