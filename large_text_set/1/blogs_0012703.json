Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nActress Kym Marsh says her Coronation Street character will be “gone for a very long time” following the devastating loss of her baby boy. \nKym , who has received high praise for her portrayal of heartbroken mum Michelle, says people won’t recognise the Corrie wedding planner and barmaid as she struggles to cope following the death of her son Ruairi at 23 weeks of pregnancy. \nKym went through a similar ordeal eight years ago when her son Archie was born at 21 weeks. \nShe told the Manchester Evening News : “I think in the coming weeks you’re going to see a different Michelle, because she is quite broken at the moment, and so you’re probably not going to see much of the old Michelle.

The actress said her character won't be the same for a long time (Photo: ITV) \nKym added: “She is broken, she is completely broken and so for a good few weeks, you’re going to see quite a broken Michelle. You might start to see glimmers of her in the future storylines but not for a very long time. \n“Her flicky eyeliner might be gone for some time.” \nKym, 40, agreed to take part in the harrowing storyline to honour her son while helping others going through a similar ordeal. \nKym was told by producer Kate Oates that she didn’t have to go ahead with the storyline, for which the soap worked with the stillbirth charity Sands, if she didn’t want to. And she had a psychotherapist on set with her at all times.
