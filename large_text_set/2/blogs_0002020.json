Steven Dearth. “It just wasn’t done fully correct.” \nHe was found inside a cage complete with food, a blanket, and dog toys seemingly all the comforts of home except he’d been left on the roadside. Dog found abandoned in cage in Hingham (WBZ-TV) \nIt was neighbors on Downer Avenue who first spotted the dog just after 11 a.m. The cage was sitting on the sidewalk overlooking Hingham Harbor. \n“We’re all dog people, we’re all dog people around here,” said May Vuilleumier. “Who the heck would do such a thing?” \nThat’s one of the neighbors who discovered the pup. She’s shocked that someone would abandon him, but believes the owner just couldn’t take care of the dog and correctly surmised this was a street where he would find welcoming arms.

Dropping him at a shelter or even the police station would’ve been wiser. \n“It wasn’t handled the way it should have been handled by the person who left the dog there,” Sgt. Dearth said. \nWhoever abandoned the dog could face animal cruelty charges, but police doubt it rises to that level. The Animal Rescue League says the dog cannot be adopted until police sort through the investigation, but people are already offering.
