Despite tweeting that it is supposed to only filter mature content, users tracked down selections like this Tegan & Sarah video that were blocked despite being incredibly tame. In a blog post tonight , YouTube VP Johanna Wright stated that \"we must and will do a better job.\"\nThe exec admitted that \"...this feature isn't working the way it should. We're sorry and we're going to fix it.\" While claiming that only 1.5 percent of traffic comes with Restricted Mode turned on, Wright also said that as a matter of principle, access to \"important content and different points of view\" should be allowed. YouTube has already manually unblocked a few videos where the system made \"mistakes in understanding context and nuances,\" but she also writes that it will take time to roll out more changes.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zr6pS07mbJc?rel=0&showinfo=0?ecver=2", "https://twitter.com/YTCreators/status/843613347367079937", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr6pS07mbJc", "https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2017/03/restricted-mode-how-it-works-and-what.html"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:43:40.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
