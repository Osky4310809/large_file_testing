In the new installment, however, he hands off to different co-stars who continue the message. \n\"On Red Nose Day, we'll meet again in Red Nose Day Actually . (Because on Red Nose Day unexpected things happen,\" the cue cards read. \"Tune in to see what happened to everyone, and, amongst other things, which one of us has aged best.\" \nAfter Keira Knightley holds up the cards, she hands off to Hugh Grant whose signs read, \"One thing's for sure...It's not Colin Firth .\" Photos \nCast Reunions \nGrant transfers to Liam Neeson , whose cards read, \"I think it's obviously Liam isn't it?\" \n\"Whateverâ€”I've grown up,\" Thomas Brodie-Sangster 's sign reads. Fans will recall he played young Sam in the original film. \n\"So have I,\" Olivia Olson 's card reads. Olson played young Sam's crush, Joanna. \n\"I really haven't,\" Bill Nighy adds. \nWatch the video above to see which star aged most gracefully and to get a glimpse of the cast back together again! \nThe Red Nose Day Actually special will premiere on BBC 1 in the U.K. on March 24 and will re-air on NBC in the U.S. on May 25.
