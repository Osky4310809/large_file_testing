(Alex Brandon/AP) \nPresident Donald Trump lashed out at the lingering questions over his ties to Russia on Twitter Monday, hours before FBI Director James Comey and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper are set to testify on Capitol Hill at the first open hearing on the Kremlin's reported interference in the 2016 election. \nTrump fired off a series of tweets from his personal account before 7 a.m., hitting on the now-familiar outlines of his defense against allegations that, if proved true, would be a major blow to his presidency. RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Trump's Crucial Week ] \n\"James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia,\" he wrote . \"This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!\" \nThe president blamed political opponents for pushing the story to excuse Trump's unexpected victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in November, and repeated his insistence that leaks from within the intelligence community should be the primary focus of inquiries and press coverage. \n\"The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!\" he said . \"The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!\" \n\"What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?\" he speculated , repeating claims that have surfaced on conservative websites. \nClapper, who served as former President Barack Obama's intelligence director for six years before retiring in January, said earlier this month that he knew of no evidence to prove a collusion between Russians and the Trump campaign. \n[ READ: What's Next for Trump's Travel Ban? ] \n\"\"We did not include anything in our report … that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on March 5, referring to a joint classified report on the intelligence community's conclusion that the Kremlin had interfered in the election. \"There was no evidence of that included in our report. We had no evidence of such collusion.\" \nNonetheless, Clapper at the time said he agreed with the report's conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had a \"clear preference\" for Trump and had supported efforts to tilt the field in Trump's favor through hacking and selective leaking of Democrats' emails. \nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee that will hold Monday's hearing, responded to Trump, calling Russia's efforts a \"fact\" and slamming the president for his unproven allegation that Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower before the election. \n\"Mr. President, the Russians hacked our election and interfered,\" Schiff wrote. \"No one disputes this now, but you. This is what is called a 'fact.'\" RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Trump’s Awkward Merkel Summit ] \nSchiff, a former assistant U.S. attorney, has emerged as one of Trump's most vocal critics on the Hill, using his perch as the top Democrat on the intelligence committee to focus attention on the questions swirling around Trump's campaign. \n\"As you will see during our hearing, Mr. President, there is no evidence Mr. Obama tapped your phones. This is what is called 'fiction.'\" he wrote in an apparent nod to Trump's habit of calling unflattering news stories \"fake.\" \nSchiff and his intelligence committee colleague chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., last week both said they had found no evidence to support Trump's wiretapping claim. That assessment was repeated by the top members of the Senate intelligence committee, chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C, and ranking member Mark Warner, D-Va. \nSchiff also criticized White House press secretary Sean Spicer for repeating a claim made by a Fox News analyst that British intelligence services had spied on Trump at Obama's behest, and Trump for his casual joke during a press conference last week with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over reports that the National Security Agency spied on U.S. allies, including Germany. \n\"Your suggestion British wiretapped you & jape with Merkel are harming our relationships with key allies,\" Schiff said. \"This is called 'collateral damage.'\" \n\"The intelligence community concluded the Russians will interfere again,\" he finished. \"This is why full investigation is important to country.
