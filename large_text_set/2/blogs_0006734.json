The Helio P series from MediaTek is generally used in mid-range devices even though the company tries to push it is a premium performance chip. Back in September of last year we saw the official announcement of the Helio X30 as well as the Helio P20 SoCs, and they spent the event talking up the Helio X30 but didn’t give any details of the Helio P25. For all their talks about how “premium” the lineup is, we have yet to see them wash off the bad taste that MediaTek has left in many enthusiast minds.\nAt the time, we weren’t expecting much from the Helio P25 other than a higher clocked version of the Helio P20. The Helio P20 was introduced in February of last year and it showed they were focused on improving the battery life of the chip. Early this morning MediaTek finally revealed some actual details about the new Helio P25 SoC and it looks like they’re focusing on dual-camera features with this new chip. MediaTek says it has superior ISP (Image Signal Processor) technology that enables advanced camera effects.\nWe’ve seen this shift toward smartphones having two camera sensors in their phones lately. Some OEMs opt for a black and white sensor as the secondary camera while others go for a wide-angle sensor for the second camera. Each has its own benefits and MediaTek wants to enhance these new devices by focusing on some dual-camera features. MediaTek says they’re using an innovative 12bit Dual ISP that helps improve resolution, reduce noise and more.\nThe company is talking about how devices using the MediaTek Helio P25 will be support either a 24MP single camera or 13MP+13MP dual camera. Since it’s optimized for two cameras, it can reduce noise from devices with a color and mono sensor, and offer real-time shallow DoF bokeh. The chip is able to record HDR video with a full preview for the user, and it can accelerate auto exposure convergence speed by 30-55%. The chip is built on a 16nm FinFET process node with ARM Cortex-A53 processor clocked at up to 2.5GHz and an ARM Mali-T880 dual GPU clocked at up to 900MHz — a significantly weaker version of what’s found on 2016 flagships.\nSource: MediaTek ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T17:23:18.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
