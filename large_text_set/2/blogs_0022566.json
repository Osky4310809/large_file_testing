Attorneys General in New York, New Mexico, and Washington state, as well as several school districts, stated they will continue enforcing the rights of trans youth , BuzzFeed News reported. \nHector Balderas, New Mexico's AG, said in a statement that he will \"aggressively enforce the rule of law to protect the health, safety, and welfare of New Mexicans; and no government entities, including schools, should discriminate against any individual.\" \nSuch actions show the positive impact advocates working together can have — even in the face of a powerful administration opposing them. Philadelphia School District says it will leave its transgender bathroom policy in place, as White House rolls back Obama-era protections. — Brian Taff (@briantaff6abc) February 23, 2017 \nBack in April while on the campaign trail, Trump weighed in on the bathroom bill controversy, saying that they should \"use the bathroom they feel is appropriate.\" He even welcomed Caitlyn Jenner to use whichever restroom she wanted at Trump Tower in New York. \nBut the LGBTQ community remained wary of Trump, considering his propensity for flip-flopping, and that his Vice President, Mike Pence, was a vocal critic of Obama's directive on transgender students. And now with the administration having moved to strip them of their rights, the transgender community knows where they stand, and are girding for a showdown. Meanwhile, support continues to pour in as people work together to make the positive changes they'd like to see.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:28:30.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
