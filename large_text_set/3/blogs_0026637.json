I guarantee it's the best teaser you'll see this week! \nJoe Donnelly: Lost world, found \nIf you've played GSC's Stalker: Call of Pripyat in the past then you may be familiar with its Lost Alpha mod—a modification built to recreate the horror/survival/FPS as it appeared in trailers pre-launch. Created by Hungarian hobbyist group Dez0wave, an early beta build was leaked in 2014 which in turn forced its creators to launch a work-in-progress variation. This was great, but didn't quite live up to the ambition nor scope Dez0wave first had planned with mod developer CrommCruac at the time saying: \"It was a hard decision to release the game in such a quick, and unplanned way.\" \nFast forward three years and Stalker: Lost Alpha is on the verge of launching a Developer's Cut edition which aims to capture everything its voluntary set out to achieve in the first place (check out this hefty changelog if you're in doubt). \"It's not a completely new game, it's however the game we had in our mind,\" says the devs. We'll get to see that vision for ourselves come April 26.

In other words, the internet in 2017. \nYes, there are moments when I regret the look of my Ryder, where the way their face animates doesn't line up with the moment, and I lose my grasp on the story, or the characters. That's bad. But there are also moments where Andromeda delivers a gorgeous angle, or the light reflects off a big, moist salarian eyeball, and I feel like I'm looking at the big-budget space opera I've always wanted. If I'm being honest with myself, this is why I'm playing Andromeda right now—to unravel its story and watch a bunch of well-lit, well-framed character models talk. Because I don't play a ton of singleplayer games and I love sci-fi, that feels like it's enough to keep me going for a couple dozen more hours. \nWes Fenlon: The progress of emulation \nA couple weeks ago I was shocked that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was bootable in a Wii U emulated just days after release. But that first step of progress was a tame surprise compared to what landed this week: video of the game running far, far better in a new emulator build, with most of its major bugs apparently fixed. There are likely tons of other bugs and issues holding it back from perfection, but it may well be playable start to finish on PC in a matter of weeks. That's an incredible accomplishment for an emulator developer. It being playable so quickly has also reignited some discussions about the legality of emulation and its ties with piracy, which is a thorny subject. I'm planning to write more about that next week. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T08:51:00.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
