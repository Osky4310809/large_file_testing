Audio: Ngadjuri and Nukunu Traditional Owners speaking at the unveiling of the world's first wind towers featuring indigenous art at Hornsdale Wind Farm. (ABC News) \nThe murals featured on the two wind turbines were created by artists from the Ngadjuri and Nukunu people, the traditional owners of this land where the Hornsdale wind farm resides. \nChair of the Ngadjuri Nations Aboriginal Corporation Quentin Argus said it was a proud moment for his people to be recognised by the renewable energy project. \n\"Recognition towards our people and to the both groups — the Ngadjuri and Nukunu — it's been a long process but a good one,\" he said. \n\"Anything to do with renewable energy which leaves a lesser footprint on the land is good for us all, so we welcome the development.\" The land, the serpent, the wind Photo: The Nukunu people refer to themselves as 'snake people'. Artist Jessica Turner has illustrated the dreamtime story of the serpent and its role in forming aspects of the landscape in this mural. (ABC Rural: Courtney Fowler.) \nSpanning the base of two of the wind turbines, the paintings tell the story of the serpent that created the land and the connection it has to the indigenous people of the region. \n\"The storyline we give to this is the one that we use to connect us with the wind and the wind farm and how the storyline travels through this country,\" Mr Argus said. \n\"It depicts how the old people would dance up the storm and travel through [the land] with the [serpent]. \n\"At the end of the day [it's] our artwork and our culture [but] everybody has got to start treating the Aboriginal culture and storylines as their own. \n\"Because at the end of the day we're all here as one people.\" A proud moment for Ngadjuri and Nukunu \nNukunu elder Michael Turner said it was a proud day for his family, representing his daughter Jessica Turner who was one of the artists involved in the project. \n\"I feel exceedingly overpowered by it because I'm up here witnessing the opening of my daughter's painting on the wind turbine for Neoen and the company Siemens,\" he said. \n\"My daughter Jessica couldn't be here with us today but I'm here to represent her as well as all of our Nukunu people. \n\"To see such a huge painting on a wind turbine gives me great satisfaction of having an artist in the family.\" \nMr Turner said the Nukunu people had a very close working relationship with the Ngadjuri people when it came to protecting the land's natural resources. \n\"We have a combined inter-relationship that we look after our country,\" he said. \n\"We work together with upmost respect for each other when we're working with these national companies.\" Photo: The artwork by Ngadjuri artists Chris Angrave and Louise Brown showcases how the Mungiura were found in the hilly country. (ABC Rural: Courtney Fowler.) Something old, something new \nSouth Australian Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation Minister Kyam Maher said the project symbolised the coming together of the world's oldest culture, with the technologies of tomorrow. \n\"It's a great juxtaposition — for tens of thousands of years the traditional owners have cared for this country and now we're looking at better ways to care for our country in terms of renewable energy,\" he said. \n\"Bringing that oldest traditional country in the world together with Siemens and Neoen, is almost like completing that matrix of the old and the new together. \n\"We know how energy is produced is changing, we know we're going to be facing a carbon constrained future and renewables will play a greater part of the jig saw puzzle for our future energy needs.\" Preserving the land \nSiemens wind power chief executive David Pryke said the installation of the artwork was a recognition of the collaborative relationship established with traditional owners during the development of the Hornsdale wind farm project. \n\"The Aboriginal community are involved right from the start of the project, we do a heritage survey on the site so they are involved from day one,\" he said. \n\"The use of Aboriginal paintings on wind farm towers at Hornsdale is recognition of the importance this land holds for the Ngadjuri and Nukunu people. \n\"It signifies the harmony between renewable energy forms of power generation and the environment and it fits in with the Aboriginal culture of preserving the land.\" External Link: Ngadjuri and Nukunu Traditional owners performing a Welcome to Country at the unveiling of the wind tower art at Hornsdale Wind Farm. Powering the nation \nSouth Australia's newest wind farm consists of 105 wind turbines providing renewable energy locally and to the national power grid. \nHornsdale Wind Farm aims to help the Australian Capital Territory achieve its 100 per cent renewable energy target by 2020, powering 70,000 homes by the end of Phase 1. \n\"It's been in three stages, each stage is a 100 megawatts,\" Mr Pryke said. \n\"We're currently building stage two and we hope to be turning some of those turbines on in the next couple of weeks and we've also started the foundation and civil works for stage three. \n\"We've now got the renewable energy power generation process down to the lowest in Australia and [we're] getting down to the levels of traditional fossil power generation, which is where we really want to be,\" Mr Pryke said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:27:00.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
