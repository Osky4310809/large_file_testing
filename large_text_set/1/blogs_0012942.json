There are over 70 entries so far. “As you can see by the list most of the answers were ‘yes’, so a lot of animals fart – just like us,” he said. “I think it’s interesting how this may have started a new debate of ‘what is a fart’.” Advertisement Advertisement 6 \nFYI, a few interesting animals that do not fart are parrots, sea anemone and shore crabs. 7 \nHowever, anyone can edit the spreadsheet, so he warns that you must keep that in mind when reading the information. “Using a Google sheet that anyone can go in and edit seemed like the best way to get the most info as we can and engage as many people as possible,” Caruso said. “Obviously user-submitted responses not subject to any verification or oversight should be taken with a grain of salt.” 8 \nThe trend certainly opened our eyes to which animals are gassier than others. 9 10 \nAnother hashtag, #DoesItPuke, branched off from #DoesItFart and sparked a whole new conversation. There’s even a separate page for it in the Google doc.
