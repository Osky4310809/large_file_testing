Their performance, compelling though it was, put neither controversy definitively to rest, for now or probably forever. On the Trump wiretap tweets, the FBI director unequivocally confirmed what everyone — including every sentient creature at the Trump White House — already knows: there is zero evidence for Trump’s charge that his predecessor engaged in Watergate-like criminal behavior. There will be no more authoritative statement that Trump’s allegations were bunk than what Comey offered. Yet this will not stop Trump from denying the truth. Our president is an incurable and congenital liar. On the Russian plot, Admiral Rogers reconfirmed the finding of all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russians had mounted a plot to interfere in the election for the purpose of helping Trump. Comey revealed the explosive fact that there is an ongoing FBI investigation of “coordination” between Russia and associates of the Trump campaign. Neither he nor Rogers would say more. With the critical question of collusion left unresolved, we remain in an ambiguous position, one that will require patience until the FBI and congressional investigations are completed. In the interim we will only see mounting speculation based upon the growing body of evidence in the public domain. But two general observations can be formulated, which pertain both to Trump’s tweets and to possible Trump campaign collusion with the Kremlin. Trump's unprecedented war on ethics: Eisen and Painter \nFirst, conspiracy theorists have a propensity to engage in conspiracies themselves. Those who see conspiracies swirling around them, shaping events, determining outcomes, are convinced subterfuge is the way of the world. They have every reason to believe that if one wants to make progress in a world in which hidden hands are controlling history, one has to conspire oneself. Trump and more than a few of his close associates are conspiracy theorists par excellence. Trump’s groundless allegations about Obama’s wiretapping are only the most recent instance. Last summer he was propounding the theory that Ted Cruz’s father had been involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy . “I mean, what was he doing — what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death? Before the shooting? It’s horrible.” And before that, there was Trump’s years-long engagement with birtherism . With such a track record, it is not at all implausible that Trump and/or his associates found it natural to collude with Russia if they were to advance toward their goals. If proven, that would be a high crime. But even if it is never proved, the damage to our country and our culture runs deep. For if our president lies pathologically, his disease is evidently highly contagious, infecting those around him in ever larger concentric circles, ranging from Trump’s television surrogates to a large cadre of cowed Republican politicians. If we study the epidemic near its center, we find affable Sean Spicer, Trump’s press secretary, and the chief spokesman of our entire federal government. Spicer began lying from the White House podium on day one with his absurd claims about record attendance at Trump’s inaugural address. With Trump's demented wiretap tweets Spicer's lying has reached a kind of crescendo, dragging the signals intelligence agency of our closest ally, Great Britain, into the scandal. The right can't defend Trump's behavior: Jonah Goldberg \nOne would think that such behavior would generate universal condemnation. But we are hearing something else. According to Ari Fleischer, former spokesman for George W. Bush and staunch Republican, Spicer is “ doing a superb job .” The role of the press secretary, says Fleischer, “is to channel the president. It is to reflect what the president wants reflected... It’s not for him [Spicer] to be himself.... It’s for him to do what Donald Trump wants him to be.” Is it really the proper role of the press secretary — or any human being — to subsume his own will to the will of his superior and jettison the basic obligation of democratic discourse and human decency: to be truthful? The historical echoes could not be darker. In totalitarian countries people accepted this kind of obedience either because they were in the grip of a poisonous ideology, or because the alternative was prison, torture, and death. Fleischer the functionary, like Spicer the functionary, embrace blind obedience freely and willingly. When the history of the Trump era is written, their abnegation of personal responsibility will deserve more than a footnote. \nGabriel Schoenfeld, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a member of USA TODAY’s Board of Contributors, is the author of Necessary Secrets : National Security, the Media, and the Rule of Law .
