The new duds were revealed on the official Twitter page for the show with a picture of star Peter Serafinowicz ( Guardians of the Galaxy , Shaun of the Dead ). The pilot, which is currently available to stream on Amazon Prime, has Serafinowicz wearing an earlier version of the costume. This post marks Serafinowicz’ first week on the set of the show. Behold good world, @serafinowicz is finally suited up for the first week on set. #TheTick pic.twitter.com/bjDlpWcULN \n— The Tick (@TheTickTV) March 10, 2017 \nThe Tick was originally created by producer Ben Edlund in 1986 as a mascot for New England Comics . Edlund then brought the nigh-invulnerable justice seeker to life in The Tick’s own book two years later. In 1994, the first The Tick series came to television as an animated half-hour show which ran for two seasons and 36 episodes. All but two of those episodes have been released on DVD. However, citing “creative considerations,” “The Tick vs. The Mole Men” and “Alone Together” were omitted from their respective DVD sets. \nIn 2001, FOX debuted the live-action The Tick series with a pilot episode directed by Barry Sonnenfeld . Despite being cancelled after only nine episodes, The Tick has remained a cult hit. The Tick will premiere later this year on Amazon’s streaming service and stars Serafinowicz as The Tick, Griffin Newman as Arthur Everest, Valorie Curry as Dot Everest, Brendan Hines as Superian, Jackie Earle Haley as The Terror and Yara Martinez as Ms. Lint. \nAre you guys excited for The Tick series on Amazon? What do you think of the shiny new costume?
