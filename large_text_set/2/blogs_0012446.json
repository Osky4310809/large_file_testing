Bob took the money out of the bank, and intended to give it to his relative later in the week, so he stuffed it in the old shirt for safe keeping.\nLater that night, Linda told her husband that she was going to donate some clothes to Goodwill, so he decided to help her out, and scooped up a bunch of old shirts from his closet, including the outdated orange shirt stuffed with $8,000 in cash.\n\"Bob is an extremely strong human being\"\nTwo days later, Bob realized the mistake he had made when he tried to add another $100 to the stack. After confessing the whole thing to Linda, the two rushed over to Goodwill where a team of employees helped them search for the orange shirt.\n\"Bob is an extremely strong human being,\" Linda told the Register. \"I don't want to hurt his male ego ... but he was crying. I haven't seen him that distraught since his parents died.\"\nThe two left empty-handed that evening, but Goodwill rang the couple the next morning with good news: Bob's shirt — and the money — had been discovered in the warehouse.\nLinda retrieved the money and tried to convince Goodwill to let her give them a reward. Goodwill declined, but after some negotiations, the couple and Goodwill agreed that a pizza party for the staff would be acceptable.\nAs for the relative, Bob found out that they no longer need the money, so now the money is back safely in the bank — hopefully until the dream vacation is booked.\nBONUS: People think Adele broke her Grammy in two and gave half to Beyoncé", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/SvS8p5hK.m3u8", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/bob-744026-linda-money.html", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/SvS8p5hK.jpg", "http://abc7.com/video/embed/?pid=1755193"], "published": "2017-02-16T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:41:55.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
