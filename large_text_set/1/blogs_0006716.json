[2] \nLucci brought Paulie back to Dock 1 as Hattori , Lucci's pet pigeon, scolded Paulie for stealing money. Hattori apologized for the events. Paulie returned the money to Monkey D. Luffy but was hit over the head by Lucci while Hattori apologized and explained that Paulie was in debt to a confused Luffy. Angered by this, Paulie threw Lucci, who broke his fall with only his fingers. Once returned back to Lucci's shoulder, Hattori introduced himself and Lucci. Nami finally realized that Lucci was a ventriloquist, amazing both Luffy and Usopp . Paulie stated that Lucci always spoke through the pigeon. As the doors of Dock 1 opened, Iceburg explained that Lucci, Paulie, and Kaku were part of the chief mechanics despite their odd personalities. [49] When Luffy demanded that Galley-La remake the Going Merry , Lucci explained, through Hattori, that it is impossible since no two ships are identical. Afterwards, Corgi appeared and talked with Iceburg, and Lucci told Paulie to mind his own business. [50] \nAfter coercing Nico Robin into working with CP9, they made an attempt on Iceburg's life and framed the Straw Hats for the crime. At the Galley-La Headquarters, Iceburg was seen unconscious in bed while a doctor informed Rob Lucci and Kalifa that he was shot a total of five times. [51] After Iceburg revealed that Robin was there, [52] the Galley-La foremen concluded that since she was a member of the Straw Hats, they must all be involved. Tilestone arrived into Iceburg's room and revealed that Luffy and Franky were fighting at the shipyard to the other members. All the members, except Iceburg and Kalifa, head off to the shipyard to confront Luffy. [53] \nOnce they arrived at the shipyard, the chief mechanics from Galley-La Dock 1 started attacking Luffy, interrupting his fight with Franky, much to Franky's annoyance. Lucci combated Luffy, who was not fighting back. Franky stopped the battle when he used Coup de Vent against Luffy and the foremen. [54] \nLucci congratulated Robin on successfully framing the Straw Hat Pirates for the attempted murder of Iceburg, and ordered her to steal Tom's blueprints that night. [55] \nBack at the Galley-La Headquarters , all the workers were seen guarding the outside while the elite five were all guarding Iceburg's bedroom. [56] \nWhen evening arrived, the CP9 group initiated their plan to steal the Pluton blueprints and invaded Iceburg's mansion while wearing disguises. Lucci and Kaku pretended to be defeated by the assailants by using two of the defeated foremen to wear their clothing. During the invasion on Iceburg's manor, Lucci and Kaku (still wearing disguises) confronted Paulie and demanded him to hand over the Pluton blueprints. [57] As Paulie fell to the floor defeated, he informed the two masked men that the blueprints were fakes. [58] Shocked by the news, the two masked men continued to stay silent as Paulie explained that he knew nothing about them or what they were after. The pair decided to eliminate him since he was involved. However, they were interrupted by Luffy who came crashing through the wall and initially noticed a beaten Paulie. During the ensuing confrontation, Lucci and Kaku restrained Luffy and Paulie to the floor. After leaving the two, the pair arranged with the others to meet in Iceburg's bedroom and to not shoot Iceburg. Once all the CP9 agents converged at Iceburg's bedroom and cornered Iceburg, the agents revealed themselves and their secret identities. Lucci demanded the blueprint's location or else there would be more victims. [59] \nLucci explained to Iceburg about the existence of Cipher Pol and CP9. He stated that the reason CP9's existence was not known to the public was because they have permission to kill anyone who does not co-operate. He continued by revealing that the World Government wished to resurrect the ancient weapon in the name of \"justice\". \nAs Lucci decided to explain their theory, Kaku kept track of Iceburg's pulse. He explained that it was odd that he would not try to hand down the real Pluton blueprints after being attacked, not unless he had already done so. Lucci mentioned Tom's Workers , which had been comprised of Tom, Iceburg, and Cutty Flam. He continued that Iceburg's mistake was that he thought that his enemies were not so close to him so they knew of \"Tom's Workers\" whom were surrounded in mysteries so much so that it took them ages to deduce that Iceburg was a disciple and that Cutty Flam's death was confirmed eight years ago by a government officer. However, the four agents remembered that a year after they had arrived, a man arrived to see Iceburg and named himself only once. They deduced that Cutty Flam was still alive and in Water 7 known by the name Franky, who had an opportunity to receive the Pluton blueprints since he was there selling material. After Iceburg's pulse confirmed Lucci's deduction to be true, they were about to leave. They were then interrupted by Luffy, Paulie, Zoro , Nami, and Chopper . [60] \nPaulie was shocked when he realized the situation and with Lucci's voice confirming that his friends were really his enemies. When Paulie attacked, Rob Lucci stabbed Paulie with only his finger. Lucci then explained that the members of CP9 have all trained countless hours to make their bodies into weapons and have mastered numerous skills that soar above normal human capabilities, Rokushiki . As Lucci was about to eliminate Paulie, Luffy attacked him with Gomu Gomu Gatling only for it to have no effect on Lucci after he used Tekkai . Using Soru , Lucci managed to hit Luffy with Shigan to the neck. Luffy escaped injury due to the abilities of the Gomu Gomu no Mi . \nAs the Straw Hats confronted Robin for her actions, Lucci interrupted and informed them that the mansion would be engulfed in flames within minutes. [61] During the ensuing struggle, Lucci caught and threw Luffy against a wall as Robin escaped through the window. Lucci then explained that CP9 have trained since they were young and were always sent out to extreme missions. He stated that they had a huge difference in combat power compared to the Straw Hats. After Kalifa announced that it was almost time for the fires to start, Lucci began to transform, shocking the others present. [62] CP9 destroys Galley La headquarters. \nThe group in Iceburg's bedroom watched in horror as Lucci transformed using his Devil Fruit ability, Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard . Kalifa informed them that the other shipwrights were on their way towards the bedroom. However, with Rankyaku , Lucci destroyed the upper levels of the Galley-La Headquarters, causing them to collapse. Paulie managed to reach Iceburg and the pair attempted to escape, but CP9 stood in their way. Just as Lucci was about to strike the pair, Luffy managed to hit him before he could use Tekkai. Lucci pierced through Luffy with his sharp nails and sent him flying somewhere in Water 7. Zoro then attacked him but was also thrown out of the building. On a rooftop close by, the CP9 members were seen watching the Galley-La Headquarters burn while Lucci explained that there was nobody to confirm the truth. [63] \nThe CP9 members went to search for Franky's location. They spotted members of the Franky Family below yelling a message for Luffy. Lucci, wearing a mask to conceal his identity, asked them where Franky was. After acquiring the location of Franky's hideout, the CP9 agents went there [64] and subdued Mozu and Kiwi . Angry at the attack on his friends, Franky attempted to attack them but was blocked by Blueno. Franky, confused as to why he was being attacked by the four and angry about the attack on his \"sisters\", questioned how they found out about the hideout. CP9 reaches Franky's warehouse. \nLucci informed them that they were spies for the World Government and that their lives in Water 7 were fake. They also revealed that they knew his real name, shocking Franky even more. However, Franky acted calm and asked them how Iceburg was. Lucci answered that Iceburg was dead and that they were after the Pluton blueprints. Franky tried to attack Lucci, but the latter was able to smash Franky through a wall and into another room while Usopp watched, unable to do anything. The CP9, unaware that there was another room, began to search it and found plates engraved with the names \"Cutty Flam\", \"Iceburg\", and \"Tom\". Franky told them to get out of the room as it was where he grew up and the world's best builder lived. [65] \nLucci kicked one of the work places as Kalifa bound Franky with her thorned whip. Lucci stated that they had the trump card that \"Cutty Flam\" had committed a crime, just as Tom had done. At this, Franky angrily stated that Tom was not a criminal, but Lucci kicked him as Usopp was seen holding his slingshot. Franky asked the CP9 agents about how much they really knew about Water 7. [66] Lucci told Franky that the \"Tom\" they were told of had good skill but was a violent fishman with great power. Despite this, Franky told them that he did not care about the World Government and would not say anything. Lucci continued to explain that despite hurting so many people, his crimes were dropped due to the fact that he was confirmed as dead. However, he would be escorted to Enies Lobby as a criminal. Blueno then took out a Den Den Mushi and handed it to Lucci, who then handed the receiver to Franky, stating that their chief wanted to speak to him immediately. As they left Franky's hideout, [67] they also subdued [68] and captured Usopp. [69] Later, Lucci confirmed that they would leave early and that he had no regrets in leaving Water 7. They then made preparations to board the Sea Train . [70] \nOn the way to Enies Lobby, CP9 encountered some complications when Sanji stowed away on the train and initiated his own rescue operation and freed Usopp and Franky. [71] The CP9 was informed that the last two coaches being disconnected and that those in the fifth coach had been easily defeated. They were also informed of the attackers' appearances and concluded that the only thing they have to do was take both Franky and Robin to Enies Lobby alive. They decided to focus on capturing Franky since saving Robin was impossible. [72] \nAfter Franky defeated Nero , Lucci gravely injured the latter, explaining that he was too weak since he only knew four of the Rokushiki forms. \nLucci continued to explain that it was worthless trying to rescue Robin and revealed that the reason she was given such a bounty at a young age was due to the fact that she has the ability to wake a weapon so powerful. Angered by this, Sanji attacked Lucci just as Robin entered the room where Usopp defeated Corgi. Sanji attempted to persuade Robin to escape with them, but the CP9 explained about Robin's reason for leaving the Straw Hats. Usopp used a smoke bomb and grabbed Robin, while Franky and Sanji disconnected the third car. [73] However, Franky landed back in the second car when he broke off the door of the third car to free it, and Robin returned to the second car through a door made with Blueno's Doa Doa no Mi . With Sanji failing to save Robin and Franky recaptured, the Puffing Tom continued on to Enies Lobby. [74] Enies Lobby Arc Edit \nUpon reaching Enies Lobby, Lucci escorted Franky and Robin to the Tower of Justice, where Spandam and rest of CP9 waited. [75] The CP9 were all reunited at the Tower of Justice as Lucci confirmed that both Cutty Flam and Robin were in custody. Both Lucci and Jabra appeared to show rivalry between them while both Kaku and Kumadori told them to calm down and show affection towards their long seen friends. Fukuro then measured their strength in Doriki and he revealed that Lucci's number is 4000. Spandam interrupted them and showed them a chest with two Devil Fruits. [76] \nSpandam then told the members of CP9 to go back to their rooms and rest. Lucci then told Spandam that he was not in the mood for a toast and had no interest in status or authority. Lucci said that their brand of justice existed for the World Government and that the government recognized Spandam as the leader of CP9 and it was their duty to complete their missions perfectly. However, Lucci went on to say that he did not necessarily have to support Spandam's ideals. Spandam then asked Lucci what he wanted. Lucci transformed into his animal-human hybrid form and answered, \"Blood,\" saying if he was there, even death was justifiable. Rob Lucci and the others then left to go to their rooms. [77] \nWhen Spandam gave Kaku and Kalifa Devil Fruits , Lucci encouraged them to eat the fruits. He told them that regardless of the type of power, how they use it was what matters, adding that there was a very low chance the fruits would weaken them, and that being a \"hammer\" is not much of an inconvenience. He went on to say that some people sail their whole lives looking for a single Devil Fruit. [78] Rob Lucci and Hattori at Enies Lobby. \nAfter Luffy defeated Blueno and shouted for Robin, Lucci joined the remaining CP9 agents on the balcony and commented on how he was surprised how a pirate actually defeated Blueno. [79] Lucci and the rest of CP9 members witnessed the Straw Hats' arrival on the rooftop [80] and their challenge to CP9 and the World Government, much to his amusement. [81] Franky revealed he had the blueprints and then burned them, shocking CP9. [82] Before Spandam dragged Robin away, he told CP9 that they had permission to kill all of the invaders. He told Rob Lucci to come with him to take Robin, since he needed to be protected. \nSpandam, Lucci, and Robin walked down a spiral staircase, as Spandam kept mocking Robin. [83] In the undersea passage, Spandam told Lucci that he heard a noise, wondering if it was his imagination. Lucci suggested that it might be the pirates breaking through the door. Spandam was astounded, saying that the door was solid steel, and that there was no way they could have found the door to begin with. Lucci told him that he remembered a small girl and her pet following them earlier, so she probably told them. When Spandam asked Lucci why he did not kill her, he smugly replied that he never received an order to do so. Spandam was annoyed, telling Lucci he should decide those things on his own. He then asked if that meant someone was following them. [84] \nSpandam ordered Lucci to drag Robin over and pull her by the hair if necessary. Lucci grabbed her by the arm, telling her it was an order for her to walk. As they continued walking, they all heard Luffy calling out to Robin. Lucci told Spandam to take Robin and continue on. Luffy and Lucci clash. \nLucci then confronted Luffy [85] and initiated a second fight with him. The two engaged in an extremely hectic and boisterous fight from which Lucci still held a noticeable advantage where Lucci withstood Luffy's attacks and countered with twice as much power. Hearing Robin's warning about the incoming Buster Call , Luffy tried to force his way past Lucci to reach her, but Lucci fought back fiercely and stopped him in his tracks, forcing him to continue the fight. [86] Luffy was later joined by Franky, but even with the added reinforcement, the two of them were still woefully outmatched by Lucci. [87] \nLuffy was unable to hurt Lucci, who hit him with Shigan \"Oren\". Franky came to Luffy's aid by trying to hit Lucci with Strong Hammer , which was able to blow away Fukuro. Franky's move was unsuccessful and Lucci struck Franky. However, Luffy entered Gear Second and blew Lucci away. Luffy managed to keep Lucci at bay and allowed Franky to leave the room to chase after Spandam and Robin. [88] However, Lucci still managed to gain the advantage when the Gear Second effect wore out, leaving Luffy in the same situation. \nAt this point, Lucci flooded the tunnels with water by using Rankyaku to break the wall to stop Luffy's crew from escaping and taunted Luffy, [89] asking him whether he would continue to fight or rescue his friends and promptly escaped to higher ground. Luffy pursued him, claiming that if he could not defeat Lucci, he could not protect any of his friends. The fight continued with Lucci easily countering every one of Luffy's attacks and thrashed him around so much he could barely stand anymore. \nRob Lucci, confident that Luffy used up all his energy using Gear Second, remarked that he was helpless before him like so many other pirates. In response, Luffy chuckled and claimed that he was going to use a different strategy and activated Gear Third with Hone Fusen. Lucci questioned the importance of \"bone\", while Luffy simply continued with his preparations. Lucci struck by Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Gigant Pistol. \nLuffy claimed that his left arm turned into the hand of a giant. Rob Lucci was unfazed by what seemed to be an intimidation tactic. Lucci stood firm against Gomu Gomu no Gigant Pistol with his Tekkai but the momentum was simply too high to block. [90] Luffy, using the humongous strength of Gear Third, punched Lucci so hard that he was flung all the way onto a Buster Call ship, almost passing out in the process. Nevertheless, he took advantage of Gear Third's lack of speed to quickly strike Luffy down with another Tobu Shigan \"Bachi\", causing Luffy to deactivate Gear Third. He then used Rankyaku \"Gaicho\" for the very first time in the air while Luffy was down on a Buster Call ship to finish him off, causing an explosion and cutting through steel on the ship. \nLuffy was fortunate that Lucci's attack missed. [91] Rob Lucci, while using Geppo to hop in the air, commented that on whether Luffy was being serious or joking around. He then used Kamisori to get to where Luffy was and thrashed him again. While Luffy was down and still deflated from deactivating Gear Third, Rob Lucci said that Gear Third was a very unbalanced technique and that he said that Luffy was willing to take the hits in exchange for that power. \nHe uses Seimei Kikan : Kami-e Bushin to make his hybrid form smaller and thinner and attacked Luffy with Shigan, crashing him to the wall and destroyed a part of it. While Lucci was choking Luffy who was stuck to the wall, he was going to say that his stupid attack was not going to hurt, but was interrupted when Luffy punched him, angering him and smashed Luffy into the wall further. With Luffy now completely stuck to the wall, Lucci commented that was unfortunate, but in Luffy's \"stupid\" form, he told him to die. Rob Lucci then attempted to end the fight quickly with Shigan \"Madara\", but Luffy returned back to normal just in time. Suddenly, Lucci partially collapsed, realizing that Luffy had managed to fracture both his legs with Gear Third. \nNow partially disabled, he was easily beaten down by Luffy. [92] While Rob Lucci was hit by Luffy's Gear Second Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol, he prepared to use the most powerful technique known to those who have absolute mastery over Rokushiki, using Soru and coming to a halt in front of Luffy. He then used his trump card, Rokuogan , to severely injure Luffy, evening the odds once again. Rob Lucci then attempted to finish Luffy off with another Rankyaku \"Gaicho\". [93] Luffy continued to press the fight, but Rob Lucci said that his Gear Second technique was starting to lose its edge, claiming that it was impossible for Luffy to escape Enies Lobby after all. He then continued by saying that even if the island lost its shape, he would pursue Nico Robin to the ends of the earth and obliterate her or anyone who got in the way of the World Government, all in the name of \"Dark Justice\", while attacking Luffy with many Rankyaku shock waves. Luffy countered them with his punches and said that they had come so far to set Robin free from such a thing. \nHe then attacked Lucci with Gomu Gomu no Jet Stamp, but it was evaded by Lucci's Soru. Rob Lucci then used another Rokuogan on Luffy to greatly damage him again, having him face down in a pool of his own blood. [94] Lucci commented that he would still kill Luffy's crew no matter how hard Luffy tried to prevent him from doing so. Lucci remained confident even after Luffy got up again due to Usopp's encouragement and used Seimei Kikan: Kaijo to return to his giant, stronger form, saying that he would defeat Luffy with all of his power at once. He continued taunting Luffy by telling him not to worry about his friends as he would send every single one of them to hell. Rob Lucci unleashes Sai Dai Rin: Rokuogan on Luffy. \nContinuing the fight with his opponent, he used Shigan \"Madara\" again, while Luffy countered it with his punches. After getting hit again by Luffy, he attempted to use Rokuogan again. Luffy, in Gear Second, tried to get out of its range and claimed that he would not get hit by the same attack again, but Lucci used his tail to prevent him from escaping the technique. Determined to end the fight once and for all, Lucci channeled all of his power into his next attack, the powerful Sai Dai Rin: Rokuogan, to greatly wound Luffy once more. Lucci is defeated by Luffy. \nRob Lucci turned around after performing his ultimate attack on Luffy but was surprised to sense that Luffy was still standing upright behind him. He turned around to see Luffy unleashing a brutal Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling. Rob Lucci attempted to use Tekkai to deflect the blows, but unfortunately for him, the enormous attack struck Lucci so hard and fast that it appeared he was being hit with dozens of fists at the same time. The attack smashed Lucci against and through a brick wall, leaving him unconscious and defeated.
