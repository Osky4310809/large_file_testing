The company doesn’t have any sort of public presence yet, but it will operate in the realm of devices that can be implanted in the human brain. Think the freaky virtual reality thing from Black Mirror or the whole situation from Manchurian Candidate. Both of those scenarios were not good for the people involved, and we’re not saying that this thing is going to be like those other (fictional) times, but we are saying we’re going to be cautious. No shady government operatives are coming around our brains, at least for the time being. \nRight now, brain-centric technology is super limited. In medicine, electrode arrays and other implants are used to counter the effects of certain neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s or epilepsy, however, there isn’t much of a precedent in the world today for intense, complex brain implants. The main obstacle right now is really that the brain is just too delicate and finicky to mess with—you can screw it up pretty easily—so even those who have the electrode arrays have used them as a last resort.
