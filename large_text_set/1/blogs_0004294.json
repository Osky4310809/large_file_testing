Picture: David Crosling Source: News Corp Australia \nWhere this leaves Robert Whittaker, Australia’s No.6 ranked middleweight, is unclear. UFC president Dana White promised that ‘The Reaper’s’ next opponent would be a top five middleweight, in a big fight in Las Vegas - which suggests on the UFC 209 card, March 4 (US time) at T-Mobile Arena. \nBisping vs Romero is the key fight to make early this year, tying up the champion and No.1 contender. Rockhold’s status is unclear after Jacare moved on from their match-up. \nWeidman (No.4) is apparently resting up, after No.5 Gegard Mousasi claimed he had been offered a match against the former champion. Easy, Pal. You were just one of a few names given by @UFC , and I'm still healing up. Glad you're finally speaking, though! https://t.co/TVPH6KWWfi — Chris Weidman (@ChrisWeidmanUFC) December 20, 2016 \nThe latest developments would seem to make Mousasi, 31, the logical pick for Whittaker’s next opponent. The Dutch fighter (41-6-2) is on a four-fight winning streak. \nWhittaker is on a six-fight winning streak and the 26-year-old is coming off an immensely impressive Round 1 TKO of Derek Brunson in Melbourne - a fight that happened just one week after Mousasi’s last match, a Round 1 TKO win over Uriah Hall. \nMousasi has said recently that he’d be happy to face Whittaker, as both are well-rounded fighters on an upward trajectory in the division. \nJacare had previously been touted as a possible match-up for Whittaker in MMA media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:36:58.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
