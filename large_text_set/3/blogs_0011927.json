Which is why McLaren had barely taken the sheet off the new 720S at the Geneva auto show before we had asked company CEO Mike Flewitt whether he was going to sign off on an even-higher-performance Long Tail version, as with the previous 650S and 675LT . \nTo his credit, Flewitt gave us an answer—and it’s a yes. “The 675LT was a huge success,” he said. “I was delighted from a market perspective, but also internally because we love that car. We have a huge enthusiasm for it. We’ll certainly repeat Long Tail, and now that the LT brand is established, if we announce an LT derivative of a car, then everyone will know what to expect: that it will be lighter, the chassis dynamics will be way sharper, and it will have more power. We’ll definitely repeat that in models going forward.” \nAll of which should make things very interesting for both the Lamborghini Huracán Performante and the upcoming Ferrari 488 track derivative, especially when you consider McLaren’s claim that the standard 720S already is very nearly as quick as the 675LT was on track.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T17:28:40.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
