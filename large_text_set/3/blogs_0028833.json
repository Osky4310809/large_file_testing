These have been added to the bottom of the translation interface below the “Alternate translations” section, along with examples of the translated word in a sentence.\nThis only works for individual words, however, the section doesn’t appear if you translate sentences. But it’s a smart addition from Google as dict.cc has traditionally been the place to go for individual word translations.\nSee also: ‘Free App of the Week’ section added to the Google Play Store 1 day ago 9to5Google notes that the definitions appear in the source language, so if you translate a word from German to English, the definition would appear in German. So far, I’ve only been able to find English definitions but it’s possibly tied to something else I’m not aware of (hit me up in the comments if you find out what’s behind that).\nIn addition, Google Translate also now has an account switcher which allows multiple accounts to access Google Translate on a single device. This means that the search history, Phrasebook and preferences of individual accounts won’t be interfered with by other users on the same device. It’s accessed in the main menu beneath the profile icon.\nGoogle Translate Version 5.8 should be rolling out in the Play Store in the coming days.\nDownload Google Translate ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:05:08.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
