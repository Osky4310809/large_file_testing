Premature birth is the leading cause of death among children younger than five years old, and can cause lifelong learning disabilities, visual and hearing problems, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports . \nResearchers for the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) have concluded that as many as 3.4 million premature births across 183 countries could be associated with fine particulate matter, a common air pollutant, with sub-Saharan Africa, north Africa and south-east Asia most impacted by the issue. \n“Preterm birth and associated conditions are one of the biggest killers of children in the US and worldwide,” said Dr Paul Jarris, chief medical officer at the March of Dimes , a US-based nonprofit focused on maternal and baby health. “Yet, there’s a lot of things we don’t know about what causes preterm birth, so every bit of information we can get is helpful.” Are you at risk? How pollution increases your chance of death – interactive Read more \n“We have known for a long time that air pollution contributes to asthma and heart disease in adults,” said Jarris. “What I think people fail to recognise is that so many of these risk factors impact babies before they are even born.” \nPrevious studies have looked at how in utero air pollution might negatively impact babies’ birth weight, or the likelihood that they will be born early. SEI’s study, which examined data from 2010, attempted to calculate how those factors might influence the global rate of premature births. \n“By showing in our study that 18% of preterm births are associated with air pollution, we are quantifying the health impacts of fine particulate matter on babies before they are born,” said Chris Malley, an SEI researcher and lead author on the study. \nEach year, around one in every 10 babies worldwide are born prematurely, according to the WHO . Africa and south Asia bear a disproportionate burden of premature births, accounting for 60% of all premature births globally. That region also dominated SEI’s report of premature birth associated with air pollution. South Asia had the most preterm births associated with air pollution.

This is one more reason why we need to be good stewards of the environment Dr Paul Jarris \nStill, two experts who reviewed the study called estimates “conservative”. \nA number of factors have been identified in playing a part on premature birth, including poverty, infection, smoking and substance use, physical activity and maternal education. However, even with the report’s limitations, it is still one of the first to argue that reducing air pollution could also be effective in reducing premature births across the world. \nBecause of a lack of research in regions such as south-east Asia and Africa, researchers used studies conducted in the US and Europe to estimate global outdoor air pollution exposure. \nIndoor cooking fires could play a larger role than the study allows for. “The exposure in Asia, and in part in say, China and India, to outdoor air pollution is significantly higher than outdoor air pollution in the US,” said Malley. “So that’s the other part of the uncertainty, that at these higher levels of exposure we don’t know whether this same relationship holds.” \nThe report focused on one kind of air pollution considered especially harmful to human health: fine particulate matter. This pollution is made up of tiny particles from a variety of emissions, such as diesel emissions and agricultural fires. \nThe particles, smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, are considered harmful because they can lodge deep in the lungs, affecting the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. Past studies have looked at these factors as ways that air pollution may impact preterm birth and low birth weight in babies.

Read more \nSouth Asia had the most preterm births associated with particulate matter pollution – as many as 1.6 million associated births. Notably, even though China has a relatively low rate of preterm births, researchers found that as many as 521,000 preterm births could be associated with air pollution because of high concentrations of particulate matter. \nA similar study conducted in the US found that air pollution had a costly impact on unborn children, estimating that the economic impacts cost $4.33bn in 2010. \nResearchers said the estimates support their conclusion that “reduction of maternal [air pollution] exposure through emission reduction strategies should be considered alongside mitigation of other risk factors associated with preterm births.” \n“This is one more reason why we need to be good stewards of the environment,” said Jarris. “The most vulnerable among us – unborn children – are affected, and really in a way that impacts families’ lives for generations.” \nGuardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring one of the worst preventable causes of death around the world: air pollution.
