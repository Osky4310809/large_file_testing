Mujiv Hataman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao at the Mindanao Week of Peace. ARMM Bureau of Public Information ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines -- Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Regional Gov. Mujiv Hataman has appealed to the leadership of the Philippine National Police to send courageous, honest and determined cops to the Muslim region. This, as Hataman resented anew pronouncements that so-called ‘ninja’ cops would be sent to the ARMM as a form of punishment by the PNP national command. “Hindi corrupt at hindi sindikato na pulis ang kailangan namin,” Hataman said while in Zamboanga City. Hataman said the autonomous region already has to deal with syndicates and criminal elements. He added the region also has to contend with kidnappings and terror groups like the Abu Sayyaf and Maute. “So, what we need here are courageous cops that are determined and not those corrupt ones. I mean, even if it's a policy, but it’s not really a good idea,” according to Hataman. He said they are trying to build up the image of the Muslim region and dumping dishonest police personnel in the ARMM will not help. “If they really want to help, they should deploy those courageous ones who are willing to run after the criminals, lawless elements and terrorists,” Hataman added. Hataman said he has not brought the issue up with PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa yet but that they are arranging a meeting to discuss it.
