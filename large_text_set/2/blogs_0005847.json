Brook has gone against promoter Hearn's advice (Photo: Richard Heathcote) Spence is Brook's mandatory opponent (Photo: Sarah Crabill/Getty) \nKhan has admitted he wants to avenge his defeat to Danny Garcia rather than facing Brook next. \n“They’re both big fights, both big-money fights, but the fight between me and Garcia is something that always hurts me,\" he said. “I know I could have won that fight. \n\"I was beating him and schooling him, until I got hit with a big shot. That was me not thinking and sticking to the gameplan. Khan is leaning towards avenging his defeat to Danny Garcia (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n“I know how the training camp for that fight went. I thought the fight was going to be a walk in the park and I didn’t take it seriously. I thought he was the new kid on the block, I thought, ‘Who is this kid?’ \n“It was all one-sided, but then I made that one mistake and got caught. \n“Since that fight, Garcia has improved and I give him credit. I think Garcia is a harder fight than Kell Brook and it’s just that unfinished business I have with him.” poll loading Will Kell Brook beat Errol Spence Junior? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:45:24.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
