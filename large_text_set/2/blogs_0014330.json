Unfortunately, the novel and well-intentioned idea took a sad turn, when a man passed away at Vadodara station . And now, post that sad event and the successful release of the film, a case has been filed against SRK, for alleged rioting and damaging of railway property. The case has been filed by a vendor named Vikram Singh, who owns a stall at Kota station. During his stop at Kota, SRK's fans caused a big nuisance at the station. And, apparently, Shah Rukh even threw something out of the train for his fans to catch, which ended up in an even larger state of chaos. During this, Vikram's trolley was overturned, goods were damaged, and he was even injured. \nAs a result, with the help of the GRP, Vikram has filed a case against Shah Rukh Khan under the following sections. They include,147 (rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed), 160 (committing affray), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs 50) and 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) of IPC. Plus, the SHO of GRP police station said SRK would also be charged under sections 145 (nuisance) and 146 (obstructing railway servant in his duties) of Railway Act, and section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:57:32.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
