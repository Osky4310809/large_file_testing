A cunning off-spinner with enormous experience and a smart lower-order batter who provides run-a-ball type innings without being a destructive, big-bashing beast. \nHe would have plenty to offer any international team. \nThis makes for a nice headline and warms the heart of the patriotism that flows through us as Australians. That the former captain of one of our fiercest international rivals wants to represent our country, well, that’s mighty flattering. \nAs a cricket-loving country we haven’t been overly supportive of Johan, or any player of rival origin. We have booed Johan and openly mocked him on social media for his bowling action. And then rejoiced in that action by emulating it at local synthetic nets when providing throw downs for the technical improvement of our sons and daughters. \nWe are a fickle and hypocritical nation. Johan Botha goes big. Source: Getty Images \nWhat surprised me most was the headline — Adelaide Strikers Coach Jason Gillespie Would Pick Sixers Spinner Johan Botha For India. Dizzy was quoted in the article as saying “He is an Australian citizen and fit and firing and if he’s doing the business I don’t see why not if THEY are eligible”. \nThe media are sneaky. These words are clearly in relation to a very broad question about the topic and can not be directly attributed to the selection of Botha. It’s this type of misrepresentation of words from the media that will see the Botha push for an Australian cap snowball into an actual thing. \nLet’s put this to bed. Johan will not be rewarded with the chance to wear the Australian coat of arms on his head. Ever. It doesn’t matter what level of BBL domination he reaches. And when Tasmania inevitably picks him in their domestic one-day team for next year’s Matador Cup and he carves it up for 20 wickets; it still won’t happen. If I’m wrong, and it does, the selection committee responsible should be stripped of their own citizenship and made to regain entry via the processes of Manus. \nReturn of The Sniper \nHe’s back! At the end of BBL05, ‘The Sniper’ sent a warning to Australian players with large skinfold readings, open-mouthed chewers of gum and anyone displaying the type of “look at me” bling that they would be continually targeted. \nEnter Dwayne Bravo. Diamond earing wearer. \nWhile Bob’s impact on the BBL so far has been small — only one hit — the destruction of Bravo’s hamstring was viewed by many industry professionals as a warning from Bob that he had spent the off-season working on the delivery of unique executions to ensure anonymity. Last year we saw a large number of regimented shots taken — top of the grandstand with the targeting of level 2 soft tissue damage — but nothing like the severity of Dwayne Bravo’s hamstring being clinically removed from his pelvis. Dwayne Bravo’s Big Bash is finished for the year. Source: Getty Images \nThe pre-placement of the landmine that sat deep beneath the surface of the MCG to remove the hamstring from the bone, and not Dwayne’s entire leg from his body, is a level of execution never experienced in the BBL. \nIt was reminiscent of the explosion that took out Simon Jones’ ACL at the Gabba in the 2002 Ashes. The timing of the detonation was sublime and as Bravo’s knee landed in his attempted four-saving dive — POW — showtime. \nLook out for the older players to be targeted next. Watson. Hogg. Voges. \nTeam by team \nHeat \nGeoff Lynn’s boy, Chris. Brendon McCullum. Oh my. \nChris Lynn can expect to hear from Mark Waugh down The Telephone Line as the first picked for the next batch of Australian T20 games. Or one day games. He’s hot. And if Brendon McCullum had his Australian citizenship, we’d pick him. \nThe bowling still holds concerns for the Heat — but while the batters are on fire it doesn’t matter what they send down. Chris Lynn is in devastating form. Source: Getty Images \nRenegades \nWithout the hamstring and diamond studs of Dwayne Bravo, the Renegades toppled the Stars in a result that was as surprising — depending how much faith you have in international cricket — as the result from the last day of the MCG. \nCameron White did the damage with the bat. And Brad Hogg did the damage with the ball. Fortunately for the Renegades the development of young talent is not a trigger to CA tournament funding. \nScorchers \nAshton Agar got them over the line with some last-ball heroics against the Renegades and was rewarded with a call-up to the Test squad. Not a bad prize. It seems JL has the national selection committee in his little top pocket. Hilton Cartwright as the next all-rounder? State Sales Manager of Talent, Western Region, Justin Langer. KP back with thrilling catch 0:43 \nSixers \nSplitting their first four games, the Sixers hold no threat to the top of the table. As of New Year’s Day, 10:45pm EST, their Net Run Rate is in the negative and they’ve played one more game than everyone else. \nStars \nThe loss of Bobby Quiney to a tight hamstring threw the balance of the Stars. Losing the experience of Glenn Maxwell from the middle order to cover the opening spot of Quiney, with the addition of Sam ‘Pepe’ Harper to No. 7, was sure to bring uncertainty and inexperience to the close of their innings. Quiney back in and Pepe out will see the Stars a more balanced team and back on the winners list. Ugly 11-ball over gets wicket 1:33 \nHurricanes \nBowling is a problem. And it is potentially due to the revolutionary training method used by the Hurricanes that popped up on social media yesterday. The Bowling Master: a collection of coins/markers placed on different lengths for the bowlers to use as targets. This type of practice offers zero by way of match simulation given the nature of the shuffling modern day batter; an area where the bowling group has struggled. Hopefully the tweet was just a promotion of the revolutionary product, and not actually being used to help professional cricketers in a format that requires constant adaptation to change. \nStrikers \nThis team holds all of my favourite modern day players: Brad Hodge and Ben Laughlin. Hodge for a career of complete domination and doing it his own way. Laughlin for being the best death bowler in the country and doing it his own way. \nThe team has only one win from three games. And it might be because Hodge and Laughlin are doing it their own way. Despite a rough start, the Strikers will be contributors come finals time. \nThunder \nDre Russ is still using his black bat, even though it was revealed the paint from the bat was leaving a dark mark on the ball. You’d hope for more focus on the team with some awareness that those batting below him might like to see a white ball rather than a murky grey one. \nThe Thunder are back to being the battlers of the tournament. Perhaps Michael Hussey is as good as everyone thought? View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
