Mobile retail conversion rates \nThis new report from the Adobe Mobile retail report has a simple table comparing cart and visit (overall) conversion on smartphone vs tablet vs desktop. It shows that visit conversion is nearly 3 times higher on desktop vs smartphone. Location : US Date : October 2016 (2016 data) Sample : Top 100 retailers (so representative of common consumer behaviour) Source : Adobe Mobile retail 2016 report \nIf you're creating a business case for mobile optimised sites as explained in ourÂ Ecommerce mobile and desktop wireframes guide Â orÂ mobile marketing strategy guide , this data is also valuable since it shows the variation in conversion rate by mobile devices type. Â Tablet conversion rates are similar, but slightly lower than desktop conversion rates,Â suggesting people are increasingly comfortable with the experience of buying on tablets. \nHowever, it's a different story for Smartphones since these convert at one-third to one-quarter of the rate of traditional or tablet devices. \nThis suggests smartphones are more of browse or research platform rather than a buy platform since many of the large retailers featured in this survey will have mobile optimised sites. Smartphone experiences should be personalised to show this different form of usage. The lower conversion rates for mobile devices are also shown in these compilations of Android vs MacOS vs iOS operating systems, which gives the latest 4th quarter data released in early 2017. Conversion rates by channel Conversion rates for other sectors:Â telecoms and travel \nThese are available in the Adobe Digital Index (ADI) - this data is available in the April 2016 published data for the whole of 2015. Conversion rates for US vs Europe vs Asia Pacific for the travel industry \nThe ADI report also compares conversion for EMEA countries against the US. UK and US conversion are significantly lower than other European countries perhaps because of less competition or Amazon being lower in these countries. Different rates of smartphone adoption will also affect this cross-platform average. UK average conversion rates from IMRG \nWith the acquisition of retail analytics service Coremetrics by IBM we lost one of our best free sources for comparing conversion rates. Within the UK data is compiled for members by retail category. These aren't shared any longer, so this is dated. This chart shows that average conversion rates for visits to sale of 4 percent. Note that these are typically for large brands, so conversion rates for less well-known brands that don't have the credibility, trust or large base of returning customers will generally be lower. Based on previous UK compilations from Coremetrics when their data was published we can say thatÂ typical average conversion rates for established retail brands are... \nConversion rate (visit to add to basket): 8% Conversion rate (visit to sale): 4% \nIt's interesting that there is a typical 50% abandonment from basket through checkout to sale, even with the efforts on checkout optimisation. It suggests many will add to basket when researching and comparing, but may eventually buy elsewhere online or offline. This is a screengrab of the Coremetrics data from 2009 which shows that visitor sessions with an add to basket or cart are typically double those of order or sale sessions. The much more recent Monetate earlier in the post also shows this. We have retained this since it shows the increase in conversion if you can encourage a visitor to search. Options for segmenting conversion rate \nAs Dan Barker suggests in his advice we mentioned at the start of this post, conversion rate gets more useful as you break it down by different types of visitors with different intent and a different relationship with the retailer. Different conversion rates and average order values can then be segmented for different audiences to understand and work to improve the quality of traffic or strength of propositions, for example: First time, repeat visitor or registered customer conversion Referring channel conversion, e.g. paid or natural search, social media, affiliates, display advertising Search type, e.g. paid or natural, brand, generic or long-tail Product category type - conversion rates are much higher for simple commodity products for example - flower purchase (double digit percentage) compared with a higher cost product that will often be purchased in store (for example beds or furniture which will often be less than one percent). Promotion type or seasonal sale - the IMRG data and Coremetrics data below shows that conversion rate can increase dramatically at these times. Conversion rates for non Ecommerce sites including B2B conversion \nI'm also often asked about conversion rates in other sectors, particularly for business-to-business lead generation. While similar caveats about sub-category, type of visitor and strength of brand apply, this is a useful compilation from this olderÂ Marketing Sherpa of average conversion rates by industry sector .
