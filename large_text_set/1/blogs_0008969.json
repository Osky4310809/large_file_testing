Today, we asked our menswear reviewers to weigh in on part one of the Fall 2017 men’s collections . Despite auguries to the contrary, London was livelier than ever. Expand Photo: Courtesy of Fashion East \nSarah Mower, Chief Fashion Critic Here’s one of my topmost enjoyable things that happened in London Fashion Week Men’s: listening to the sparkly, bright-eyed 22-year-old Eden Loweth talking to me about “being on the trans scale,” while watching a choreographed pretend classroom lesson where lots of friends of his age, some of them who’d flown from New York, acted out their own various stages of transition, wearing dresses and skirt suits. “This is the very first time she’s dressed this way in public,” Loweth said, pointing someone out. It was a tender, sweet, dramatic thing to see, this birth of the new Art School label, clearly done on a shoestring, but with facilitating help from so many quarters—Lulu Kennedy’s Fashion East for one, and the amazing young choreographer Theo Adams, for another. \nThat’s what I felt was so uplifting about the last few days—the idealistic resilience of the young in London and their determination to stand up, organize together, and say, make, and do things against the gloom. When backs are against the wall, the British spirit is at its best—and it’s a super-liberal, open, diverse, witty, and collaborative spirit, in total opposition to Little Britain Brexit nationalism. Expand MAN’s Charles Jeffrey Loverboy Photo: Kim Weston Arnold / Indigital.tv \nWe saw it all over, coming from Daniel Fletcher, who said he is fed up with young people being looked down on, he has started up his online business selling smart sportswear, and has rented a studio block where other young creatives can afford to work (rising rents being a dreadful London issue). We saw it in the exuberantly fantastical performance by Charles Jeffrey and his multitalented Loverboy friends (also abetted by the Theo Adams company), a narrative that confronted dystopian fears about political mayhem, but rose above them. We saw the defense of poetry and symbolism, creative expression, and London’s position as a uniquely diverse capital from Craig Green , Grace Wales Bonner , Christopher Shannon, Agi & Sam , Matthew Miller , and James Buck and Luke Brooks of Rottingdean Bazaar, to name a few. The shows renewed my faith in fashion as an honorable medium that can transcend itself and send out good and inspiring messages to the world. Business is tough, but the admirable determination of these people to make their own ways around it started 2017 off on a brilliant footing for me. \nLuke Leitch, Contributing Editor Hey, Sarah! Yep, this was a really fascinating London season, and I thought there were two parallel narratives that made it so unique. One is wider world, post Brexit and Trump, it feels (to misquote Lenin) as if decades have happened in just a few short months. Un-good decades. Expand Christopher Raeburn Photo: Yannis Vlamos / Indigital.tv \nThe second story is fashion macro. The upping and offing of Burberry, Alexander McQueen, and Coach—plus the tactical temporary withdrawal of other, mostly tailoring brands—has left this London menswear event without what believers in pillar theory reckon were the main providers of a commercial canopy under which the rest of London’s crazy-kid creatives could frolic. On the first day, many an edit­or was muttering, “It’s a bit quiet this season, isn’t it?” (They’re saying the same thing about Milan, too.) Here, though, that line in small talk fast faltered, because the designers that were here soon made us forget who wasn’t. All of the names you’ve already mentioned were, indeed, on fire. Big respect especially to Fashion East for incubating so many creative prospects. Both Charles Jeffrey (who last season I was totally unimpressed by, but this season left me with a this-could-be-big thrill) and Art School are building not just brands, but communities, which seems like absolutely the way to go. \nI think this moment represents a real opportunity. Not such for the freshest up-and-comers, but for certain designers who have been on the scene for a while. Because the flip side to that commercial canopy pillar theory is that it encourages to overlook or patronize mid-level designers. Why can’t Christopher Raeburn, for instance, build his excellent brand—so notable for the greenness of the product as well as the cut of them—into a far larger concern? By taking away the big-name canopy, those that remain have access to more of the attention that can enable them to flourish. Expand Vivienne Westwood Photo: Marcus Tondo / Indigital.tv \nP.S. I especially enjoyed Hussein Chalayan and Vivienne Westwood but am gutted that, once again, I had to miss Oliver Spencer. I know you said this was a collection for “cool dads,” Sarah: maybe that’s why he’s my favorite London-schedule menswear designer to wear. Over to Nick—who’s just cool. What were you into this London, sir? \nNick Remsen, Contributing Editor I think what I was most struck by in London was its, let’s call it, strangeness in sportswear—particularly with regard to accessories. Maybe it’s a manifestation of the heartbreak and consequential rallying efforts that Sarah discusses—bizarre mutations, that is, resulting from stormy new realities (here in the United Kingdom, back in the United States, and, really, kind of everywhere). Expand J.W.Anderson Photo: Kim Weston Arnold / Indigital.tv \nYou saw it at J.W.Anderson with crochet-knit flaps applied to Vans-like slip-ons. Odd, but cool, and as Sarah said in her review, thoroughly English. You saw it at the excellent Cottweiler , with backpacks that looked stuffed together as if in the throes of emergency. (The label also had great, wild card pendant necklaces of stoner-y blown glass.) Cottweiler was more aggressive in vibe, though no less unusual. And you saw it at KTZ, Marjan Pejoski’s nocturnal street brand, where the designer mostly removed aggro-novelty in favor of heavy external lacing as a motif. It looked weird, but convincing, and still very much true to form. \nTo the KTZ point—my seat neighbor DM’ed me later on Instagram asking what I thought. He then said, “Just the ticket for Berlin . . . very Berghain.” (Berghain being the hedonistic super-club of lore in the city.) Pejoski had told me earlier that, in the end, he just wanted “to celebrate love, to create a church of love.” Berghain is the ultimate pleasure palace, if you will—and, even if the tone of London Fashion Week Men’s overall was uncertain, passion did shine through (Anderson with love of country, Cottweiler with strong commentary on overdevelopment). Stranger things are yet to come, but there’s something appealing—and impactful—about the effects of not yet knowing what they are.
