When we updated the jungle camps in pre-season to give each a stronger identity, this left Kindred in an odd state. While other junglers have the option of clearing camps based on their individual strengths, Kindred’s passive forces them to fight whatever Wolf has marked. This hits hardest with Wolf’s very first mark: Kindred has significantly different choices to make if their target is the enemy Raptors instead of a Rift Scuttler. Given how crucial the start of a game is for junglers, the volatility in possibilities for Kindred’s first mark felt exceptionally bad. We’ve made a few other changes to smooth Kindred’s jungle mark progression by pushing highly-contested monsters later in Wolf’s mark tiering system and preventing enemies from stalling the Eternal Hunters out by holding marks hostage. We also cleared up a feels-bad scenario where Kindreds who chain-cleared their first seven marks were left without a new Wolf target until 20 minutes, when Baron Nashor finally spawned. Passive - Mark of the Kindred WOLF MARKING After 70 seconds ⇒ 50 seconds of having no active jungle mark, Wolf marks an enemy jungle monster for 5 minutes ⇒ 3 minutes BIGGER PREY Possible camps for Wolf’s jungle marks have been updated, based on how many stacks Kindred currently has. At the indicated number of stacks, Wolf can mark: FIRST TIER Rift Scuttler, Crimson Raptor (with 0, 1, 2 stacks) ⇒ Rift Scuttler (with 0 stacks) SECOND TIER Crimson Raptor, Gromp, Ancient Krug, Greater Murk Wolf (with 3, 4 stacks) ⇒ Rift Scuttler, Crimson Raptor, Gromp (with 1, 2, 3 stacks) THIRD TIER Red Brambleback, Blue Sentinel, Rift Herald, Elemental Drakes (with 5, 6 stacks) ⇒ Red Brambleback, Blue Sentinel, Ancient Krug, Greater Murk Wolf (with 4, 5, 6, 7 stacks) FOURTH TIER Baron Nashor, Elder Dragon (with 7+ stacks) ⇒ Rift Herald, Baron Nashor, Elemental Drakes, Elder Dragon (with 8+ stacks) LeBlanc W damage reduced. Q deals more damage to minions. LeBlanc is one of the strongest champions in the right hands, and despite multiple trips to the Patch Notes this season, she’s still one of the most contested champions. We’re pretty clear on what it is we want the Deceiver to be doing: using the split-second confusion of clone gameplay to avoid retaliation until her target is dead and she’s jumped back to safety. ...You know, deceiving people. Today’s LeBlanc has the tools to be a trickster, but her brute strength allows her to borrow from the “death is the longest CC” camp and treat damage as the ultimate trickery. Normally, we feel comfortable hitting a champion’s unintended strengths, and giving them something back to compromise. In this case, LeBlanc has been so dominant that our top priority is getting her in line, and from there we can investigate ways to flesh out LeBlanc’s fantasy. Q - Shatter Orb DAMAGE TO MINIONS 40% ⇒ 80% REMINDER Shatter Orb’s modified damage against minions extends to any Sigils of Malice it triggers W - Distortion DAMAGE 85/120/155/190/225 (+0.6 ability power) ⇒ 40/55/70/85/100 (+0.2 ability power) MIMIC DAMAGE 125/225/325 (+0.5 ability power) ⇒ 60/120/180 (+0.3 ability power) Lucian Q and W are smoother to cast. Despite his buffs at the start of the year , Lucian’s been struggling pretty hard. With the prevalence of massive poke damage in bot, Lucian simply can’t get close enough to start the skirmishes he’s meant for. As it so happens, we’ve recently shipped changes to rein in the dominant marksmen and their builds. That being the case, we’re treading carefully: moving Lucian too far up when others are moving down could overshoot the problem. For the time being, we’re smoothing out the flow of his gameplay, fixing up a few spots where Lucian felt a bit slow to respond. Q - Piercing Light CAST TIME 0.35 seconds ⇒ 0.4 - 0.25 seconds (at levels 1-18) HAIR TRIGGER Lucian more reliably responds to commands issued immediately after Piercing Light’s cast time W - Ardent Blaze CAST TIME 0.3 seconds ⇒ 0.25 seconds HAIR TRIGGER Lucian more reliably responds to commands issued immediately after Ardent Blaze’s cast time Miss Fortune Q bounce now has the same base damage and ratios as the first hit. If the first hit kills a target, the bounce now crits instead of dealing 50% increased damage. Though Miss Fortune hasn’t reached Jhin or Varus levels of prominence, she’s still pretty oppressive in her own right. (Those of you who’ve lost three-quarters of your health bar in lane to a Double Up bounce know what we mean.) By the numbers, Double Up’s early-game damage was bonkers even before Lethality and Deathfire Touch became the norm. Tying bonus damage to Miss Fortune’s last hitting is a slick reward for learning her playstyle, but bounces also just had bigger numbers to begin with. Double Up’s first hit now has to kill a unit for the bounce to hit hard early on, and even then, the numbers are far more reasonable. For Miss Fortunes willing to give crit another chance, however, late-game Q’s will reliably knock the teeth out of squishies no matter how she lines up the shot. Q - Double Up BOUNCE BASE DAMAGE 40/70/100/130/160 ⇒ 20/35/50/65/80 (matching the first hit) BOUNCE TOTAL AD RATIO 100% ⇒ 85% (matching the first hit) BOUNCE AP RATIO 50% ⇒ 35% (matching the first hit) removed MINI CRIT Bounces no longer deals 50% increased damage when the first hit kills a target new REAL CRIT Bounces can now critically strike, and always critically strike when the first hit kills a target. Damage is affected by crit multipliers (ex. Infinity Edge). Rengar Base armor down, W monster damage conversion to grey health down. Rengar relies on his ability to get early ganks and kills in order to snowball games, but when he’s able to do so without putting himself at some degree of risk, it puts him far ahead of other junglers that also need to go aggro early. Taking more damage in the jungle will force Rengar players to decide if they really want to gank that lane, or if they should go back to base after their first clear.
