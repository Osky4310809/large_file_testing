The star, who has paved the way in Hollywood by speaking openly about issues such as photoshopping, body image, and being yourself, has basically taught us everything we know , and for that we’ll always be grateful. Indeed, last year Winslet opened up about how, when she was starting out, she was told by a teacher that she’d be only be able to play the “cute, fat best friend” role (tell that to her Oscar, tbh).\nNow speaking at the fourth annual WE Day in the UK, Kate Winslet shared her story of being bullied and how she overcame the experience. \nTalking to 12,000 people strong crowd at Londons’ Wembley Arena, Winslet spoke about how she was bullied for wanting to become and actor.\n“They called me Blubber. Teased me for wanting to act. Locked me in the cupboard. Laughed at me,” she said. “I was even told that I might be lucky with my acting, if I was happy to settle for the fat girl parts.” \nWinslet talked about the devastating effect this had on her self confidence, noting, “I felt that I wasn’t enough, I wasn’t good enough. I didn’t look right … and all because I didn’t fit into someone else’s idea of ‘perfect.’ I didn’t have the perfect body.” \nContinuing, Winslet said that all the negativity just spurred her on even harder to achieve her dream.\n“I didn’t lock myself away and give up on my dream. I fought back,” she said. “I had to ignore the negative comments. I had to believe in myself. I had to choose to rise above it all, and I had to work hard. You have to be indestructible to do what you love, and believe that you are worth it. And sometimes that’s the hardest part.” Her break through moment came, Winslet said, when she was cast, aged 17, as Rose in Titanic .\n“The most unlikely candidate –Kate from the sandwich shop in Reading –suddenly acting in one of the biggest movies ever made! You can be from anywhere and you can do anything, believe it. It is possible to overcome your fears,” she said.\n~ And this is exactly why she is my rolemodel and why i am so proud to have her as my rolemodel These are just such true words and real treasure [#katewinslet #kateelizabethwinslet #rolemodel #actress #idol #blonde #leonardodicaprio #followme #follow4follow #wemovement #weday @wemovement] \nA post shared by Kate Winslet-Rocknroll (@winsletconfession) on Mar 22, 2017 at 8:38am PDT \nWe can’t applaud what Kate Winslet is saying more. As she notes, it’s hard to overcome negativity, but she is living proof that it’s possible, and we find her journey so inspiring. We love that she’s also sharing her story with young people in the bid to help them overcome their difficulties.\nSeriously, we love you Kate Winslet!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:20:01.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
