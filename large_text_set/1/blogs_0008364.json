December 16th 2015 a year ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to ban smoking in Russia. Picture: Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool via AP. Staff writer and The Sun News Corp Australia Network Share Share on Twitter \nVLADIMIR Putin wants to kick smokers’ butts by introducing the harshest cigarette laws ever conceived by a government. \nThe clean living, fitness freak loathes people smoking around him and wants everyone in his country to snub out their filthy habit. \nUnder plans to rid Russia of tobacco once and for all, anyone born after 2015 would be banned from buying cigarettes, according to The Sun . Vladimir Putin, pictured right, loathes smokers.

A Russian soldier has a smoko. If Vladimir Putin gets his way, anyone born after 2015 will be banned from buying cigarettes. Source: AFP \nRussian news site Izvestia says it has seen a policy document titled “concept for the state policy to counter tobacco consumption in the years 2017-2022 and beyond”. \nIt says the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation confirmed the document is being widely shared across government. \nNikolai Gerasimenko, a member of the Russian parliament’s health committee, said: “This goal is absolutely ideologically correct.” The fitness fanatic Russian leader likes his air clean.
