What’s it gonna be? What’s it gonna be be be be be?” Steph chants, before breaking into a low-key dance. \n“Are you ready?” she asks, before reaching into a huge bag to reveal a pink balloon with ‘It’s a girl’ written on it, and the pair shriek. \nNoah seems absolutely nonplussed with the news of the new arrival, and is more interested in the balloon.

We love you Becks!” and finishes it off with another little dance, two whoops and a cry of, “Baby number two!” \nBut some of Steph’s fans were a bit confused, and offered her their well-wishes at her apparent new addition to the family. \n“Congrats on ur baby girl,” commented a number, who clearly thought she was sharing her own happy news.
