This writer can sufficiently say that the trailer lives up to its promise and how! Everything seems bigger - drama, visual grandeur, conflict and a war between the two warriors - Baahubali and Bhallaladeva. Snippets from the Baahubali trailer. \nAlso read: Baahubali 2 trailer: Rajamouli's sequel looks spectacular; Prabhas-Rana's action is the highlight \nSpeaking to the media after the trailer launch, Rajamouli said, \"We couldn't delve into the story in the first part and the visual grandeur overshadowed the emotions between the characters. However, in Baahubali 2 , the drama and conflict between the characters will be as grand as the visuals.\" \nWhen asked if he had to revisit the story after the success of the first part, the director said: \"The story and the screenplay is still the same. But yes, we did tweak few things to make the action and drama look better. Having said that, I didn't change anything in the film's story to suit the expectations of the audience. Moreover, we had already shot a substantial portion of the second part even before Baahubali - The Beginning released.\" \nAdmittedly, he's less tensed now compared to what he was going through two years ago just before Baahubali was about to release. \"We had put everything at stake when Baahubali - The Beginning was about to release. I have never felt so tensed in my life as I did in the weeks leading up to that film's release. Now, I'm very calm and confident, although I still am eager to see how people are going to react to our film,\" he said. \nEver since the first part ended in a cliffhanger, which resulted in the biggest mystery in recent cinematic history - Why did Kattappa kill Baahubali? - there have been several theories about why Kattappa could have done that. \nRajamouli is aware of some of these theories floating on the internet; however, he confesses that none of them have got it right. \"Some of them did come close to predicting what I had in mind, but I am not bothered with the idea that people might have already guessed a big part of the story. You've to look at the narrative and how everything connects together which leads us to that epic moment in the film,\" he adds. \nThe epic moment that Rajamouli is referring to is the clash of titans - Mahendra Baahubali and Bhallaladeva, played by Prabhas and Rana Daggubati respectively. \n\"We've shown them as powerful warriors in the first part. So, what better way to end the story than to show them lock horns with each other?\" Rajamouli said. \nOver the past few years, the director had gone on record to say that he's a good storyteller, but when it comes to directing the film, he's never sure about how any scene is going to shape up. The cast and crew of Baahubali at the trailer launch. \nWhen it came to the trailer, we asked him if he's happy with the output and he laughed saying, \"When we are shooting the film, we have no clue how it's going to look on big screen. Background music, visual effects play a major role in determining the experience for the viewers. When the final sound mixing of the trailer, along with Keeravaani's background score, was done, I was thrilled with the final output.\" \nCurrently, the team is leaving no stone unturned to finish the film's post-production to ensure that the film releases across the world on April 28, but this isn't going to be the end of the Baahubali franchise. \nWhile the producers - Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni - have ventured into expanding Baahubali's presence on other platforms like comic books, novels, television show, virtual reality, we couldn't help but ask them if it's possible that there'll be more films in future. \nShobu Yarlagadda says, \"Definitely. While creating comic books, novels or any other content related to Baahubali universe, we have ensured that all of them are set in different time-frames. We can certainly hope to see more feature films based on the characters of Baahubali, although it's too early to even suggest who might direct them or act in these films in future.\" \n  11:52 am   11:52 am Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T09:02:21.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
