In it, it said it’s planning to build three new Gigafactories.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com Tesla’s first Gigafactory is in Nevada where the company is planning to begin small batch manufacturing of the Model 3 and other components, such as battery fuel cells. Tesla said it will decide locations for Gigafactories 3, 4 and “possibly 5” sometime later this year. The second Tesla Gigafactory was identified as the company’s New York-based solar plant.\nNo word on when The additional factories, and keep in mind we don’t have any word on when Tesla plans to break ground on these or when they might open, could drastically improve Tesla’s automobile manufacturing output.
