Iconic dialogues of the movie have seeped onto every generation. All in all, the movie is straight-up epic, even after decades. So when Amitabh Bachchan, in an interview recently, revealed that one of the scenes in the movie took 3 years to shoot, we weren’t surprised in the least. The actor gave this trivia away at the launch event of the Ramesh Sippy Academy of Cinema & Entertainment, “I wonder if you remember a scene in Sholay where Jaya (Bachchan) had to light a lamp in the corridor, and I am sitting in the outhouse playing the mouth organ. There was particular kind of lighting that was required for the shot. Our DOP, Mr Divecha, was keen to take the shot at the time of sunset. You would not believe that Ramesh ji spent almost three years before we finally got that shot.” \nReminiscing director Ramesh Sippy’s tenacity for perfection, he further added, ““Every time we would go to enact that sequence, something would not be right with the lighting. And Ramesh ji said ‘until we get a correct light, we are not going to shoot this’. We waited for three years for one flash of a shot for the film.” \nAce filmmaker Ramesh Sippy has tied up with the Mumbai University to launch a course in film production and entertainment.
