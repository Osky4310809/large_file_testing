He could not be reached for comment. \nPayton’s arrest stems from an East Mount Airy traffic stop in which he was a passenger in a minivan. At Payton’s June 2013 trial, O’Connor testified that about 8:45 p.m. Oct. 23, 2012, he and his partner, Brad Momme, stopped the minivan on the 300 block of East Upsal Street for a faulty brake light. He said that as he approached the minivan, he saw Payton, who was a passenger in the middle row, “reaching down” to his right. After the van’s driver, front-seat passenger and Payton got out, O’Connor said, he found a silver semiautomatic handgun on the floor next to Payton’s seat. \nPayton, who was the only one of the three men charged with unlawful possession of the handgun, testified at his trial that he “never reached,” did not know there was a gun on the floor next to him, and was not in possession of it. \nCommon Pleas Court Judge Daniel Anders credited O’Connor’s testimony and convicted Payton, who in 2007 had pleaded guilty to an unrelated gun-possession case, of unlawfully possessing a firearm and related offenses. At a sentencing hearing that August, the judge sentenced Payton to 8½ to 17 years in state prison. \nA pattern? \nIt wasn’t until after Payton read a June 12, 2014, Daily News article that he gained ground in seeking a new trial. \nThe article was about a retired Philly cop, Herbert Spellman, who sued O’Connor and Momme in federal court, contending he was unlawfully stopped and frisked by the cops while walking on Wister Street on Sept. 10, 2013. \n’Connor and his former partner, Colin Goshert, who pulled Bell over about 9:20 p.m. Aug. 5, 2010, while Bell was driving in East Germantown. \n’Connor testified in Bell’s case that after he pulled Bell over, he saw Bell “reaching” down. After Bell got out of his car, a Glock handgun was found under the driver’s seat, O’Connor testified. \n’Connor rebutted Bell’s account of what occurred. \n’Connor and Goshert did not violate Bell’s rights by stopping him, but found that they arrested Bell without probable cause and illegally searched his car. Jurors awarded Bell $100,000 in compensatory damages and $500 against each officer in punitive damages. \n“after-discovered evidence.” He contended the new information he learned from the lawsuits showed that O’Connor had a pattern of conducting illegal searches. \n’s sentence. The court sent Payton’s case back to Anders for a hearing to determine if Payton should get a new trial. \n’s newly discovered “evidence could likely result in a different outcome if a new trial were granted, because it calls into question the character of Officer O’Connor.” \n’s hearing was before Anders on Jan. 13. At the hearing, Bell, now 34, testified that O’Connor lied about the reason for stopping Bell and the location of the gun found in Bell’s car. \nProsecutors argued that OConnor has been credible. They contended that although Bell won money in his civil trial, it did not mean O’Connor has a pattern of lying. \nAnders did not rule on OConnor’s credibility. In his decision granting Payton a new trial, he said Payton met the four factors needed for a new trial, including that the after-discovered evidence could not have been reasonably obtained by the end of Payton’s trial and that it could likely have changed the verdict in his trial. \ns Office, when asked recently if prosecutors would appeal Anders’ decision granting a new trial, said: “We’re exploring all our options at this time.” \nPaytons case is next listed for a hearing before a different judge on Tuesday. Martin last week said she could not comment on what is expected to happen that day.
