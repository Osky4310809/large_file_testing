Dusty-Brush wants to modernize your cleaning routine. \nThe universal vacuum cleaner attachment promises to spruce up the smallest areas and most delicate objects. \nFrom the father-son team of Niko and Dominic Moraitis, Dusty-Brush recently blew past its crowdfunding goal, raising more than $426,000 from 5,530 Kickstarter backers. Early-bird buyers can expect their new accessory to ship this spring. \n\"We work with machines that create a lot of dust. Our toolboxes and general objects were always getting dirty, and could only be cleaned with a lot of effort,\" the startup's campaign page said . \"In the search for a solution for a way to speed up this annoying work, we came up with the idea of Dusty-Brush.\" \n\"As with an ant colony, it takes working together to get the job done well. We transferred the idea to Dusty-Brush,\" they added. \nEach tube, made of high-molecular weight thermoplastic polymer, moves independently, making its possible to fit the flexible device into small, uneven surfaces in cars and houses. And since the plastic doesn't create static electricity, folks can use the attachment on sensitive electronic devices and even pets. \nThe idea for Dusty-Brush was born in June 2015; the first prototype came four months later. A Kickstarter campaign launched in November 2016. \nThough backers snagged the Dusty-Brush and adapter (for use with Dyson vacuums) for discounted prices, the attachment is expected to retail for about $50. It is available to pre-order now in three sizesâ€”1.8 mm, 2.3 mm, or 2.8 mm. Tack on an additional $10 for the anti-static option.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T15:38:22.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
