That means you won’t be able to open up a new Space or add new content to existing Spaces, plus new members won’t be able to join. \nHere is what’s posted to Google’s support page, detailing the closure. \nA few important details: \nSpaces will be read-only on March 3rd: This means you can’t create new spaces, posts or comments. Also, new invitations can’t be sent, and new members can’t be added to spaces. \nBetween now and April 17th, you can: See, save, print, and delete your content. Delete any spaces you created, leave any spaces you joined, and remove people from your spaces. Report abuse in Spaces, and block other Spaces users. \nAfter April 17th, 2017: Spaces and their content will be deleted. \nOur goal with Spaces was to create a better small-group sharing experience, and we’ll use what we’ve learned to improve other Google products and services. Thanks again for your support. \nSincerely,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:49:53.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
