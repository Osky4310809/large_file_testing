They didn’t have it. Yeah they had lots of the ball, tippy tappy, but they didn’t do a lot with it.\" Everton's Ademola Lookman celebrates scoring (Photo: Reuters) Pep Guardiola looks on at Goodison (Photo: Getty) Souness in the Sky Sports studio (Photo: Sky Sports/Getty) Read More Everton 4-0 City player ratings: Who was YOUR man of the match? \nThe defeat is Pep Guardiola's biggest ever in a league match and the Spaniard admitted it was not the first time his side had suffered, despite controlling possession. \n\"The consequence of the game is an example of many that has happened this season. It is football. \n\"In football you sometimes don't need to do many things to score. They arrive once and score a goal. It is not today it is almost all the season and it is tough for the players to handle that situation. \n\"Of course we can do better. It is awful for my players.
