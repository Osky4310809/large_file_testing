I'm not big into politics but it doesn't take a genius to notice her policies are a total 180 from what Tom stood for in the past. 5 and due to the content of their lyrics and the message, i would hope the proceeds would go to a good cause of some sort that would be special 3 Bro, do you even Audioslave? 2 yay! more pseudo-intellectual political bs from a bunch of 50 year old men. At this point its just sad 2 Who are also wealthy and not connected to the average person in any way. Tom Morello singing \"We're the 99 Percent\" when he's not was a classic moment in lacking any self awareness. 3 WhatMade 10 · 13 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply I think folks are kind of waking up to this more now, while i appreciate folks challenging the system and \"sticking it to the man\" it does not have the same impact as someone down on their luck really telling the truth in a song. Its pretty transparent when you are preaching this stuff, and you drove to the venue in a limo, hummer, bmw, whatever have you, and you make Millions of dollars and go back to the comforts of a mansion. There's a kink in the chain there. 0 More like PROFITS of Rage, amirite guys? 1 Exactly, talk talk talk, check check check, run for congress to make a difference, you wont make as much money but you can preach and actually help the real cause to what you selling 0 I didn't know whether to like or dislike, so here, have a neutral reply. 0 This is going to be interesting, I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt. 1 What's with all these anti-Tom Morello comments? Why does a person's political opinion no longer matter once they made something of themselves? Once you make money you're no longer allowed to stand for the disenfranchised? 1 Well, ideally, he would use all that money to correct those wrongs, not profit from them. 0 Anjohl 440 · 10 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply I thought most of their lyrics and messaging in general was aimed at systemic abuse, not individuals. Morello didn't become rich because he exploited laws, systemic structures, and people. He became rich because he's a talented and innovative musician, so a lot of us threw money at him. The people he's criticising took money from people who were unwilling or in some cases unable to afford losing their money. 1 he does support charities you know. 0 That's like shooting fish in a barrell when your a celeb 0 I think the negativity comes more from the example of the \"we are the 99%\" stuff, its so transparent that it almost is a slap in the face 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:52:10.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
