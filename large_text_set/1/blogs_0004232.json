Not only is he a tremendous player, he provides almost as much entertainment off the court as he does on it.\nWhen he isn’t trolling Chandler Parsons (constantly) on Instagram he’s doing stuff like wearing his own jersey to the club and hitting on famous celebrities on Twitter .\nOne of those celebrities Embiid has hit on in the past is Rihanna and he still hasn’t given up hope of hooking up with her some day.\nIn fact, Embiid thinks that if he becomes an All-Star this year he might just have a realistic shot with her.\nWhy does he think that? Well, back in 2014 he said that he tried to hook up with her and she told him to come back when he’s an All-Star…\nThis is the truth… I was trying to get with this famous girl and she said \" Come back when you're a All Star\" bruhh pic.twitter.com/CFBnRqnKMA \n— Joel Embiid (@JoelEmbiid) August 17, 2014 \n\nSo now he’s been hitting up his Twitter followers to vote for him to help him achieve this very noble dream…\nThere is my chance to finally be with my CRUSH so i need your help y'all ha….. Joel Embiid #NBAVote https://t.co/lzxoKq2n10 \n— Joel Embiid (@JoelEmbiid) December 29, 2016 \n\nEmbiid even made a point to mention his “crush” during a post-game interview last week. He didn’t give away her name, but come on, we all know who it is. TMZ even said that according to their sources it is definitely Rihanna.\nCan’t say as I blame him for trying after watching this…\n\nSo, if Embiid does make the All-Star team this year will she follow through on what she told him in 2014? \n#TrustTheProcess.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:36:57.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
