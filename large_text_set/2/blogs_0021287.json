You can take the boys out of Manchester...

Secondly, why is he so behind everyone else anyway? (Photo: davidbeckham/Instagram) 3) Phil Neville is dressed for Sixth Form \nNot our words (you like fine to us, Phil) - but a valid observation nevertheless from one Instagram commenter. (Photo: davidbeckham/Instagram) 4) There is a LOT of leftover bread \nThere are two theories about this in the photo's comments. One: has it been deliberately left for chip butties once they finish boozing? Two: has Gary used it to create a model of his planned skyscraper to show the boys? (Photo: davidbeckham/Instagram) 5) There's no Scholes or Giggs \nWe hope they were invited and simply couldn't make it. Otherwise it's a little awkward... (Photo: John Peters) 6) David Beckham needs a haircut \nWe're no fashion gurus, granted, but forgive us for saying that a short back and sides probably wouldn't go amiss for ol' Becks. (Photo: davidbeckham/Instagram) 7) It looks like Phil Neville have two glasses of water \nOne in hand, one on the table. The birthday boy is taking absolutely no chances with his body's hydration as he enters his 40s. (Photo: davidbeckham/Instagram) 8) David Beckham had to be the one sat next to the mirror \nMaybe that's be chance, maybe he simply gravitated towards it. Either way, the model of the group is the one able to see his reflection with a mere glance across. (Photo: davidbeckham/Instagram) 9) Who picked up the bill? \nA question we've always wondered when mega rich folk go for dinner, and this is no exception. Do they split it four ways? Do they play a game to decide? Or do they just do a runner?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T16:54:30.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
