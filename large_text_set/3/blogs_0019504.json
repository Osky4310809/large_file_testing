And then the horse remembers it used to be a racehorse. \nShamrock gives his rider a woah-ful ride. Nick Bull/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nI did this once and survived. \nI could barely stay on a horse to begin with, but the owner of the stables put me on a retired racehorse. Apparently, its knees hurt a little. However, this particular horse, on seeing a field, simply stretched his legs a little and gave me an immensely smooth ride. \nThe same didn't happen for Nick Bull. \nIn a charmingly panic-laden video he posted to YouTube , Bull takes his retired racehorse down what looks like a country track. \nThe horse is called Shamrock. From the GoPro footage, however, you'd think he was called \"Whoa, Shamrock.\" \nFor Shamrock gives Bull something of a rock'n'roll ride that, inevitably, ends with him rolling off the horse, with pain his only accompaniment. \nBull didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. However, he offered on YouTube: \"Please excuse the bad language and girly screams at the end.\" More Technically Incorrect", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:00:25.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
