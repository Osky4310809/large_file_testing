"persons": [], "text": "Feb 23, 2017 This article will appear in the April issue of ELLE. For many Americans, Kellyanne Conway was a shock, invented out of whole cloth (and the tweets of her client). But her mendacious, loquacious assault on liberalism has been more than 20 years in the making. She's not a cynic; she's an ideologue of the anti-establishment right. And she's the most powerful woman in Washington. Kellyanne Conway knows how to shrug off a storm. It's a borderline-blizzardy Saturday night in the posh New York suburb of Alpine, New Jersey, but when Conway arrives at a chandelier-lit mansion a quarter mile from her own Alpine spread, she appears as hermetically protected from the effects of ice and snow as she always appears unfazed by the rage and derision that come at her nonstop in her capacity as Donald Trump's most recognizable emissary to the world. Conway glides in and slides out of animal-print snow boots and a glamorous, casually belted fur coat. Underneath she has on a body-con black gown with slit sleeves and gilded, bejeweled crossbars up the arms (Who's it by? \"It's vintage,\" she says), gleamingly accessorized with a Jimmy Choo handbag, gold consignment-shop Chanel slippers (\"My feet are so wide that I buy my fancy shoes used; someone else can stretch them out\"), diamond-pavé earrings, and a cocktail ring the size of Wyoming. But what she is really wearing is an air of victory. Vindication . Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Conway's friends—her \"entourage,\" they call themselves on the Evite—are throwing her a great big bash. The theme: \"I'm With Her,\" a final piercing of Hillary Clinton by her own campaign-slogan arrow. Conway's close friend, Marlena McMahon, has arrived bearing piles of custom baseball caps and tee shirts: Republican red and with a K for Kellyanne in place of the H . From the moment she took over the Trump campaign in August, Conway not only sent an essential message—Just because you're a woman, you don't have to vote for one—she embodied it. And 53 percent of white female voters concurred. A peek at a guest list left on the bar reveals some familiar conservative names: Reagan wordsmith–turned– Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, taxation nemesis Grover Norquist, Citizens United president David Bossie, mega-conservative mega-donor Rebekah Mercer. But tonight is about civilian friends, too, some of whom ferried and fed Conway's four kids during the campaign, even as they planned to vote for Clinton. As they leave their cars with the valet and wander into the house two by two, they seem not the least bit elite —just a group of folks to whom America has been very, very good. Betsy Schuman Dodek, a sweet-faced woman whom Conway met during a law-school summer internship and who voted for Clinton, says of Conway: \"I'm so incredibly proud of the glass ceiling she broke!\" That sound you hear is the sound of millions of Hillary Clinton supporters spitting out the shards. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, who views Conway as no less objectionable than the widely excoriated White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, has her own analogy: \"Conway is to oppressing women what Bannon is to white supremacists.\" Conway arrives with her fingers and toes polished, but not her face and hair, so in a bathroom off a guest bedroom, she is awaited by Fouzia Fanane, a Moroccan-born Fox News makeup artist who has known Conway for 20 years and who schlepped over from Queens in the snow to do her up for tonight. Asked whether she'd be willing to make this trip for other TV talkers, Fanane offers no comment beyond a little, sarcastic snort. \"Always smiling! She lights the room, I swear.\" \"I am getting up in the morning to do CNN and Meet the Press, \" Conway says, plopping down in the makeup chair. \"If I am still in this dress, you'll know I had a good time.\" Conway at a rally on November 4, 2016 Getty Just three weeks after Trump's inauguration, that good time is a distant memory. Pressed to characterize White House press secretary Sean Spicer's reiteration of Trump's exaggerated claims about the crowd size at his inauguration, Conway originated the phrase \"alternative facts.\" To justify the president's travel ban against non-U.S. citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, she tried to stoke fear of an imminent threat by referring to a terrorist attack that never happened—what she called the \"Bowling Green massacre.\" And despite the giant conflict-of- interest clouds that loom over the Trump administration and family, Conway breezily violated the executive branch's ban on staff endorsing products or companies when she urged Fox News viewers to \" buy Ivanka's stuff .\" (Ivanka Trump's clothing line had just been dropped by Nordstrom.) Advertisement - Continue Reading Below More than anyone else in the administration, Conway has warmed to the task of championing the most brazen fictions ever spoken by an American president. In the words of James Fallows, a national correspondent for the Atlantic , \"She has internalized Trump's sense that there's no reality other than what they choose to present minute by minute.\" \nMore than anyone else in the administration, Conway has warmed to the task of championing the most brazen fictions ever spoken by an American president. No doubt there will be new alternative facts to add to the list by the time this story comes out. But the national awe at her marvels of mendacity only distracts from the real Conway story: her extraordinary influence, and the personal and ideological ties that hold it steady through all storms. Donald Trump loves data. He loves loyalty. And he loves people who are good on TV, praising him. He and Conway bonded when she joined his campaign and demonstrated a serious knack for all three. (The two first became friendly years ago, when Conway and her husband lived in one of Trump's buildings in Manhattan.) She has a so-far symbiotic partnership with Bannon, whom she says she's known \"a few years.\" She has a much closer and longer-standing bond with Vice President Mike Pence and is equally tight with the media-shy Mercer family, who've been bankrolling the Trump-Pence agenda since well before the hyphenate \"Trump-Pence\" existed. Donald Trump and Kellyanne Conway on election night Getty This is key to understanding the long game that Conway is playing—one that she's been teeing up for the last twenty-odd years. Going by her extensive list of clients and causes, as well as her own statements, Kellyanne Conway envisions an America in which taxes are low, government regulations are few, abortion is illegal, climate science is suspect, immigration is tightly restricted, and guns are a right but gay marriage is not. Whether that thrills you or terrifies you, she is now the most powerful woman in Washington. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below To a degree that has yet to be sufficiently appreciated, the Trump campaign was actually a merger. A twice-divorced former Democrat turned ideologically amorphous New York business tycoon made common cause with the reddest of Republicans. It was the one deal without which Donald Trump never could have become president. And Kellyanne Conway played a major role in sealing that deal for him. \"Besides Trump himself, Kellyanne was/is singularly responsible for Trump's campaign success,\" e-mails veteran Republican strategist–turned–libertarian Mary Matalin, who called the election for Trump early on. \"She comes from the real world, and she has always been able to tap into 'the country class,' \" as opposed to the ruling class. Part of that, Matalin says, flows from Conway's \"decades of insightful polling.\" And then there's her unflappability. \"She is extremely steady and confident in her world view, political philosophy, phenomenal and varied skill sets, and therefore can stand her ground easily and gracefully.\" From the beginning, however, the political media almost eagerly underplayed her importance, depicting her mainly as \"the Trump whisperer\" who helped curb the candidate's Twitter antics and could occasionally get him to mind the teleprompter. Even after she'd helped pull off one of the greatest upsets in American political history, journalists and pundits shrink-wrapped her significance. Postelection, Saturday Night Live has done Conway both as a closet adult secretly remorseful for having foisted Trump on the nation, and a lusty, lying Roxie Hart, craving nothing but the sight of her own name in lights: CONWAY. Kate McKinnon as Kellyanne Conway and Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live Getty Commentators struggle to make sense of her in real life. Muses Fallows, \"Why is Sean Spicer simultaneously a more tortured figure (à la Melissa McCarthy) than Conway, and one easier to empathize with? Because his flop sweats at the podium suggest his inner awareness that he knows he's been given an impossible job. Precisely because he knows that so much of what he has to say is bullshit, he's going to say it all the more loudly.… You can laugh at that; you can also understand it…but Kellyanne Conway is the daily public face of a flat disregard for actual facts and truth. And that, in my experience, is something new.\" Others put it even more bluntly. \"The world is her spin room, and what she is doing is spinning straw into plutonium,\" says Bob Garfield, host of WNYC Radio's weekly show On the Media . Fair enough, but don't underestimate the substance behind the spin. Conway grew up among and still sees the world through the eyes of the very kinds of working-class Catholics whose votes would swing the 2016 election to Trump. She spent more than two decades as a pollster, often working with self-styled mavericks such as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and aspiring Missouri senator Todd Akin (he of the \"legitimately raped\" women don't get pregnant view)—one proto-Donald after another, all men who had trouble appealing to women. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Her client organizations are similarly right-wing; among them are the antiabortion Susan B. Anthony List, the National Rifle Association, the Heritage Foundation, the Federation of Americans for Immigration Reform, and the Center for Security Policy, whose president, Frank Gaffney, sets eyeballs rolling with paranoid theories about an Islamic takeover of America. In 2015, Conway conducted a poll for the CSP purporting to find that more than a quarter of U.S. Muslims embraced jihad to punish nonbelievers and undermine non-Muslim states. Critics declared her poll to be severely flawed. But Conway didn't care; in an interview with Gaffney, she pronounced the conclusions of her research \"alarming.\" Along the way, she developed a relentless kind of media savvy. \"She was going to arrange for media on the right, and I was going to arrange for media on the left,\" recalls Democratic pollster Celinda Lake of a publicity tour she and Conway did for the book they coauthored in 2005: What Women Really Want: How American Women Are Quietly Erasing Political, Racial, Class, and Religious Lines to Change the Way We Live . Conway promptly lined up four appearances on Fox News. Her methodology, according to Lake: \"On the right, we believe in repetition.\" Fortuitously for her task in 2016, she evinced an almost plasmic distaste for both Clintons that's often cast in terms of her marriage to George T. Conway III, a man who wrote a Supreme Court brief on behalf of Bill Clinton accuser Paula Jones and who also—people still drop and darken their voices to tell you this, although it's been said for decades—allegedly leaked Monica Lewinsky dirt to Matt Drudge. But given that Kellyanne had already spent the late-1990s impeachment era on the Clinton-bashing circuit, it seems rather sexist to see her antipathy as George's doing—that's kind of like saying that Hillary got her politics from Bill. The Conways are a power couple separately and equally known for their contempt for the ultimate power couple of their time. So by the time Kellyanne took the helm of Team Trump, she wasn't merely a Republican woman, she was a right-wing warrior. \"When people say to me, 'How could women vote for Donald Trump?'—that entire line of argument offended many women,\" Conway says. We're in Trump Tower in Manhattan, a few weeks before inauguration. Conway comes in from a meeting upstairs with the president-elect. She is only about 15 minutes late but apologizes emphatically, sits herself down, kicks off her shoes, and folds her legs underneath her in a palpably temporary office. You'd have no hint of the occupant except for a red cap on a shelf that says make polling great again. (She jokes that she called herself \"hashtag Rapunzel\" during the campaign because she spent so much time in Trump Tower, working. \"I said, 'I have to keep myself healthy and fit, but if we lose Michigan by half a point because I was on the treadmill, I will feel guilty for the rest of my life.' \") \"All women look at themselves as voters— duh, \" she continues. \"But they don't look at themselves as a 'female' voter in that 'I must vote for the woman, I must be part of the sisterhood.' \" \"Sisterhood\" is a swipe, of course, at traditional feminism, which Conway considers angry and overly preoccupied with reproductive rights. (About the millions of women around the world who protested Trump's presidency the day after his inauguration, she's said, \"I didn't see the point.\") \"What does the average woman in this country do each week?\" she says in her office. \"Does she fill up the grocery cart and the gas tank, or does she get an abortion?\" It seems to be a favorite line; she dropped it word for word in a 2014 speech at the Leadership Institute, a leadership academy for young conservatives. \n\"What does the average woman in this country do each week?\" she says. \"Does she fill up the grocery cart and the gas tank, or does she get an abortion?\" Interestingly, in that same talk, she pushed back against any Republican with little Beltway experience who might dare to seek the presidency in 2016. \"What is your experience in DC?\" she asked, eyebrow cocked. \"You're just going to parachute into Washington, DC, and figure out how to deal with the agencies and the Congress?\" How times have changed. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Conway pops open a can of Diet Coke and addresses one of the few decorative features on the wall of her Trump Tower office: two U.S. electoral maps, broken down by state and county. \"I was obsessed with the counties,\" she says of herself in campaign mode. Even as her ideological bona fides were helping Trump turn out the Republican base, her south Jersey pragmatism helped him chip into the Democratic one. For the next four years, Conway's focus will be trained on the same spots on those maps: on several dozen counties, many in the Midwest, that are full of Catholic, often-union, sometimes-Democratic voters. Most of them voted for Obama in 2012, but a game-changing number went for Trump this time—in part, she says, because his campaign treated anyone who might be harmed by Obamacare as a \"grabbable, gettable Donald Trump voter.\" Short weeks from now, when protests rock the Trump presidency, it will be these crucial swing voters that Conway clearly has in mind as she spearheads the White House counterattacks. These voters, Conway viscerally believes, do not care about refugee rights and the legal opinions of federal judges one-millionth as much as they care about the harsh business of making ends meet every day. And these voters, she confidently bets, are likely to rage right back at any politician, media outlet, or neighbor who's more upset about the former than the latter. This is the essential—many call it evil—genius of the Trump/Bannon/Conway political strategy: It lassos together struggling Americans who are not racists, misogynists, or even right-wing activists with Americans who are. And it fuels Trump from all those sources. Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump Getty Conway bristles at any suggestion that her side won by inflaming racist sentiments, though it's hard to imagine that she doesn't know why people think that. (Remember when John McCain tried to rein in the race-baiting at his rallies? The Trump campaign just sat on its hands.) What Conway wants to focus on instead is that Trump successfully targeted white voters who were stressed about their finances, whatever their racial views happened to be. It was an opportunity she'd spotted long ago. \"We had not run up the total in presidential years among white working-class voters,\" she notes of Mitt Romney's take in Minnesota, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Michigan. \"The only reason you talk about white working-class voters is because you had an African American president who was able to motivate such a high percentage of African American turnout.\" Whether or not Conway can be considered \"alt-right,\" she's certainly hard right, which in the eyes of liberal opponents can seem an almost invisibly fine distinction. But that debate does not alter the fact that the pivotal white votes Trump garnered in swing states are the same ones Democrats had been thrilled to have in the recent past and will certainly try to recapture.

She was born Kellyanne Fitzpatrick to a 23-year-old mother who had traveled farther than necessary to give birth in a Catholic hospital. When Kellyanne was three, her parents divorced, leaving her to be \"raised by these Italian women\"—her mother, grandmother, and two maiden aunts in Atco, New Jersey. At 16, she was crowned Miss New Jersey Blueberry Princess, but she's expressed greater pride in the more industriously earned title of World Champion Blueberry Packer. At St. Joseph High School in Hammonton, she was a cheerleader who dated a jock, but she clearly hit the books. \"I'm all math and science,\" she says. \"Always have been.\" At Trinity College in DC, she made Phi Beta Kappa, then graduated with honors from George Washington Law School. Conway stayed single until her mid-thirties. And anyway, it was Ronald Reagan who first swept her off her feet. She cut her teeth as an hourly wage intern for Reagan pollster Richard Wirthlin, and by 1995, at age 28, she'd founded her own polling company—called The Polling Company—and built a small but steadily engaged boutique firm. She became known for her love of Barry Manilow; her ability to walk two poodles in high heels; and her talent for maintaining a smiling civility under all circumstances. Somewhere along the way, George Conway, who had made partner at the high-powered New York law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz at 30, set his sights on her. According to a friend of Ann Coulter's (she did not return ELLE's calls), he pursued her to the point of giving Coulter, whom Fitzpatrick knew as a fellow Republican \"pundette\" making the cable-TV rounds back in the Lewinsky days, the weekend use of his Long Island mansion in exchange for fixing them up. They married in 2001 and have four children: three daughters and one son, all under the age of 13. \nMommy wars are not the wars she's interested in fighting. It was on account of the kids that Conway initially hesitated to take a full-time White House job. (Given that the first offer made to her was press secretary and the one she ended up taking was counselor to the president, holding out for something better may have been involved.) She took some blowback for mentioning the domestic dilemma, \"predominantly from childless interns born in the 1990s and women who have cats for their Twitter profile pictures,\" she says with a shrug, before noting that liberal women, from Obama counselor Valerie Jarrett on down, were among those who urged her to go for it. Mommy wars are not the wars she's interested in fighting. For the combat Conway does relish, her comrade-in-arms is Bannon—the perennially unmade bed to her \"nary\" and \"if you will\" decorum and polish, the shadow operator to her public face of the administration. By many accounts, they came to the campaign as a package deal at the behest of the Mercer family, and so far their contrasting styles and portfolios have served them well. It's hard to say, however, how their relationship will transition from campaign to government; how their influence, individual or combined, will work relative to that of chief of staff Reince Priebus, senior adviser (and Trump son-in law) Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump; and how the overall balance will be affected by Bannon's rise to such bizarrely unprecedented heights as a permanent seat on the National Security Council, a significant step up from his pre-campaign role as chairman of Breitbart News, the nativist news aggregator. (As I write this, stories are circulating that Priebus is solidifying his power and that Kushner and Ivanka scuttled an executive order meant to roll back LGBTQ rights .) Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Kellyanne Conway on The View Getty Still, it's clear that Bannon and Conway have a great deal in common. They're both gleeful enemies of the Republican establishment—\"Talk about a swamp,\" says Conway. \"They just want to throw more crocodiles and seaweed into it\"—and fans of the Tea Party. They both revere Pence. They've poured their visions into candidate and now president Trump. For the funding of their chief endeavors in recent years, they've both benefited enormously from the generosity of the Mercer family. A few short years before Donald Trump took a battering ram to the Republican Party, a much quieter figure had begun softening up the walls. Since 2010, Robert Mercer, co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, has contributed tens of millions of dollars to hard-right figures and causes. There is not sufficient space here to list all the recipients of Mercer largesse, but to give a flavor of their funding: Rebekah—the political face of the family, one of three daughters, and the distributor of the Mercer funds—sits on the board of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that has had a major hand in shaping and staffing the new administration. They are also major backers of the Susan B. Anthony List, which has billed itself as \"the NRA of the pro-life movement\" and which eventually swung crucial support to Trump. Since 2011, Mercer money has also flowed to Breitbart News. Going into the 2016 cycle, the Mercers backed Ted Cruz for president and bankrolled several super PACs, each called Keep the Promise, on his behalf. Conway headed Keep the Promise 1. \"They are the most warm, welcoming, unassuming, most gracious people,\" Conway enthuses. \"They never want access; they never want ambassadorships.\" The Mercers definitely do want political influence, though, and they now have an unimaginable amount of it. Once Trump became the Republican nominee, they were virtually the only major Republican donors to wholeheartedly back him. As such, they loom very large in the Trump world order. Conway's own standing in that order can only be enhanced by her connection with Rebekah, a mother of four whom Conway describes as \"a cherished girlfriend\" to whom she is \"very close\"—and with whom she'd considered working to build a pro-Trump national political superstructure, had she not taken the White House gig. President Trump, with Kellyanne Conway behind him, in the Oval Office Getty When the Cruz campaign folded, this small Mercer contingent—Rebekah, her money, Bannon, and Conway—simply migrated to Trump. Perfectly capping it all off, David Bossie of Citizens United—the right-wing nonprofit that had served as plaintiff in the landmark 2010 Supreme Court ruling allowing organizations to spend unlimited amounts of money on political causes—soon joined the campaign as Conway's deputy. \"My feet didn't touch the ground for days,\" says right-wing bête gris Richard Viguerie of hearing that Trump had tapped Conway. \"We all know and love Kellyanne.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \"We all\" are self-described \"movement conservatives\" whose intellectual elders, like Viguerie, have been plotting a takeover of the GOP since Barry Goldwater, whose modern heirs are the Tea Party, and whose values find near-perfect expression in the person of our vice president. Both shunned by and shunning the traditional GOP donor-and-consultant class, these movement conservatives have produced very few true believers who are also political professionals capable of running a successful national campaign. Conway is one of them. Six days after the Women's March, she and Pence were part of a smaller but exultant crowd in Washington: the March for Life. From the presidency on down, the levers of political power in America are now controlled by the most energetically antiabortion forces since Roe v. Wade, and their woman up onstage has done as much as anyone to make that the case. As a talking head on TV, Conway spins, ducks, and weaves. Here, she is standing still and tall. No \"alternative facts\" about it; she is bearing witness. \"I am Kellyanne Conway! I am a wife…a mother…a Catholic…counselor to the president of the United States!\" she shouts out to hearty cheers. \"And yes, I am pro-life!\" The only thing unusual about her presence at the march is that this time, she's onstage. Most years she's down in the crowd, as I am with a bunch of people who've taken a 12-hour bus ride from Michigan. Some years she's marched with her kids in their strollers. Ask about her relationship with pro-life leaders, and people cross their fingers and say, \"Like this.\" It's the same gesture that they use to describe her relationship with Pence, who elsewhere is reviled for his belief in antigay conversion therapy and funerals for aborted fetuses. Here, he's a rock star. Conway counts Pence as one of her most prized clients and herself as part of his \"kitchen cabinet.\" In fact, in 2014, when the then-Indiana governor briefly toyed with a White House run of his own, she urged him to go for it. When I asked her, on a scale of one to ten, how strongly she'd advocated for Pence to take the number-two slot on the ticket, Conway shot back: \"Twelve.\" But as I talk to people in the crowd, it's also Conway's name, her arrival in Trump's orbit, that gave his campaign cred among antiabortion voters. \"There is no decision that Trump made in hiring that had a bigger impact on hard-core evangelicals and pro-lifers\" than hiring her did, says Joe Arlinghaus, who runs an organization in Texas called the National Life Persuasion Project. Pro-choice advocates were equally impressed, albeit ominously so. \"One of the most significant indications in our mind that they are really serious about this agenda is the position and power that Kellyanne Conway holds in this administration,\" says NARAL's Hogue. By 2016, there was a strong sense among die-hard conservatives of having been sold out by their own party. Antiabortion activists increasingly felt that GOP leaders merely went through the motions of solidarity. But back then, Trump did not strike this group as promising; going into the Iowa caucuses, a consortium of pro-life leaders, led by the Susan B. Anthony List, published an open letter titled \"Donald Trump Is Unacceptable.\" The next month, Antonin Scalia died, bringing the issue of the Supreme Court to the front burner, on boil. Inevitably, Trump's success at knocking out his competitors for the Republican nomination wore down the resistance to him. Conway's hiring nuked it. \"It was a tremendous moment for me, because I had worked with Kellyanne,\" says Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, who'd been trying to talk up Trump to skeptics in his ranks. \"When he chose her, I was able to turn to them and say, 'Ya see?' \" Conway did not solely conceive or execute Trump's religious-outreach effort. But she had a definite hand in how effective it became, particularly with regard to Catholics—perhaps even more so than Bannon, who is not nearly as well known or trusted at the grassroots level as she is. \"I really wasn't given a green light until Bannon and Kellyanne came on,\" says Deal Hudson, publisher of the Christian Review , who led Catholic outreach for both campaigns of George W. Bush.

Hudson got the go-ahead last August, for example, to ask prominent Catholics to join the campaign's Catholic Advisory Committee. Attention was paid to the differences between appealing to pro-life Catholics versus pro-life evangelicals, as well as to the fact that many Catholics do not vote on the abortion issue, but might be receptive to a broader cultural and economic message—you work hard, you play by the rules, you don't want the high school football coach getting in trouble because he said a prayer before the game—crafted with them in mind. Trump released a short video praising the canonization of Mother Teresa, which made a stir across Catholic media. On at least one conference call, according to a participant, Conway assured Catholic leaders that she had prayed with Trump and could vouch for him as a man of faith. Kellyanne Conway on This Week with George Stephanopoulos on January 22, 2017 Getty Meanwhile, Trump also announced a separate, if somewhat overlapping, Pro-Life Coalition, headed by none other than Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List. In September, guided by Conway and Dannenfelser, Trump issued an open letter inviting pro-lifers to join this coalition. The letter originally consisted basically of boilerplate: promising to nominate pro-life justices, defund Planned Parenthood, and so on. But remarkably, the candidate took it upon himself to go further. He strengthened both the language and the content, promising that he would not only support the Hyde Amendment, which forbids federal funding for abortion and which has been renewed annually since 1976, but make it permanent law (and thus \"enshrine discrimination against low-income women and women of color,\" as Hogue sees it). And in the final presidential debate, evoking babies \"ripped\" from their mothers' wombs \"days before\" the due date, he repelled pro-choice voters—but galvanized pro-lifers, whose support he has already richly repaid in policy. Just three days into his presidency, Trump reinstated but also vastly expanded the \"Mexico City\" prohibition on U.S. funding for overseas organizations that provide or offer counseling on abortion. One week later, picking from a list of pro-life–approved judges, he nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. \"I see my Kellyanne. Oh, Kellyanne, come here. Come here. Come here, Kellyanne. Get up here. Come here, Kellyanne. She's been so great. Wow! Wow,\" Trump effuses at a black-tie event on the eve of his inaugural. Resplendent in a one-shoulder red sheath, Conway bounds up, waves, and curtsies with a flourish. \"So, there is no den she will not go into,\" Trump booms to the crowd. \"When my men are petrified to go on a certain network, I say, 'Kellyanne, would you do it?' 'Absolutely, no problem.' Then she gets on, and she just destroys them. So, anyway, thank you, baby.\" It's an undeniably warm moment—but also a weird one, in the way that male acknowledgment of female power so often is. Praise for the clear and present achievement is tied up in ribbons of adoration for other, mutually contradictory traits. In this moment, Trump sees Conway not only as a political operative par excellence. She's also his \"baby\"—and yet, his prime centurion, so void of fear, so full of ferocity, as to put his men to shame. \nShe's \"a kind and gracious person,\" as she sometimes feels the need to point out, who had no problem casting Hillary Clinton as an irretrievably soulless crook. It's not just Trump who sees her this way. It's how Conway sees, and has long sold, herself. She's \"a kind and gracious person,\" as she sometimes feels the need to point out, who had no problem casting Hillary Clinton as an irretrievably soulless crook. \"Grace\" is such a meme with her—see her \"I misspoke\" tweet post-Bowling Green: \"It's called class, grace, deep breath\"—that one can't help but wonder if she was the unnamed \"Trump insider\" in a recent VanityFair.com piece about her: The source sniped at Reince Priebus for failing to resign as chairman of the RNC after Mitt Romney lost in 2012: \"That's never happened before. The losing chairman has the grace to step down.\" Conway is the doyenne of the dual duel: soft voice, harsh words. Light touch, heavy combat. Vivisection with a smile. When Chelsea Clinton twitter-blasts her about Bowling Green, she blasts right back: \"I misspoke. You lost the election.\" When Hillary greets the ninth circuit court's unanimous ruling against Trump's travel ban by tweeting a plain \"3-0,\" Conway counter-tweets a plain \"PA, WI, MI.\" But by mid-February, the pressure only gets higher. The Office of Government Ethics asks the White House to consider disciplining Conway for hawking Ivanka's products on TV. The Today Show 's Matt Lauer hammers her for insisting that National Security adviser Michael Flynn had the \"full confidence of the president\" mere hours before Flynn resigned (or was fired) for making false statements about conversations he'd had with the Russian ambassador. Conway even gets hit for tweeting a Valentine's Day message to a white nationalist on Twitter, though she insists someone else may have sent it from her account. Meanwhile, \"alternative facts\" settles in at around a million hits on Google, while on Twitter, the phrase \"Propaganda Barbie\"—coined to describe her inauguration outfit—continues to trend briskly. Working and dreaming and plotting and polling since the days of Reagan, Conway now finds herself at the very center of American power. It's where she always wanted to be. Propaganda? Absolutely. Barbie? Only a fool would think that.
