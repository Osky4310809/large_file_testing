Ira Winderman since the breakup of the Big Three, but Dion Waiters now has his moment, named Monday as NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period ending Sunday.\nWaiters becomes the Heat first Player of the Week since Dwyane Wade was named Jan. 31 last season, and just the 12th in the franchise's 29 seasons to be so honored. Heat players have now taken the honor a total of 54 times. \nWaiters had not previously won the weekly honor over his first five NBA seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Oklahoma City Thunder . \nIncluded in Waiters' performance over the judging period was a game-winning 3-pointer against the Warriors and then a decisive late 3-pointer two nights later in Brooklyn. Over the course of the four-game judging period, Waiters averaged 23.3 points (tied for eighth in the East), 5.0 assists and 4.5 rebounds, connecting on 12 of 25 3-point attempts. \nSince LeBron James left as a free agent in the 2014 offseason, the Heat have not had an NBA Player of the Month and only four times have had a Player of the Week, with Chris Bosh named on Nov. 2, 2014, Wade on March 22, 2015 and then last season, and now Waiters.
