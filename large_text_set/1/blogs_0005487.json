Carrie Rausch, who recently turned 108, may have to leave her home at Sunrise on the Scioto. (Columbus Dispatch) \nDespite what her daughter calls an “unyielding positive attitude,” Rausch faces trouble ahead. \nShe may be forced to leave the assisted living center where she moved to three years ago after spending nearly 80 years in the same home. \nSusan Hatfield started a GoFundMe page for her mother because “she has outlived her assets, and her current facility does not accept Medicaid as a payment source.” Rausch's daughter said that the facility where she currently lives does not accept Medicaid as payment. (Google Maps Street View) \nThough some states such as New York have programs that assist the elderly with room and board in assisted living centers, Ohio's Assisted Living Waiver program does not. \nZsa Zsa Gabor memorialized at Beverly Hills funeral Mass \n“I sincerely believe that moving her now would be devastating to her,” Hatfield said on the page, adding that if she cannot come up with more money, her mother will need to move to a nursing home. \nHatfield said that $40,000 is necessary to keep her mother at the assisted living center for another year. \nShe has raised more than $6,000 as of Wednesday afternoon.
