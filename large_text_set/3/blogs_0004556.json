Unfortunately, proud declarations of feminism very often lead to hordes of strangers lining up to tell a woman what they‚Äôre doing wrong and what feminism isn‚Äôt .\nFor Watson, that meant that a lot of people tearing her down today following an in-depth profile in Vanity Fair . The attack seems to be led by (but by no means limited to) a Sun article with a typically Sun take on the whole thing, tweeted out by an English talk radio host.\nEmma Watson: ‚ÄúFeminism, feminism‚Ä¶ gender wage gap‚Ä¶ why oh why am I not taken seriously‚Ä¶ feminism‚Ä¶ oh, and here are my tits!‚Äù pic.twitter.com/gb7OvxzRH9 \n‚Äî Julia Hartley-Brewer (@JuliaHB1) March 1, 2017 \n\nBecause according to The Sun and Hartley-Brewer and their ilk, you can‚Äôt talk about feminism and show this much skin. Especially not, in their view, since Watson once gave an interview to Mail Online in which she touted the ‚Äúless is more‚Äù philosophy:\nI find the whole concept of being ‚Äòsexy‚Äô embarrassing and confusing. If I do a photo-shoot people desperately want to change me ‚Äì dye my hair blonder, pluck my eyebrows, give me a fringe. Then there‚Äôs the choice of clothes. I know everyone wants a picture of me in a mini-skirt. But that‚Äôs not me. I feel uncomfortable. I‚Äôd never go out in a mini-skirt. It‚Äôs nothing to do with protecting the Hermione image. I wouldn‚Äôt do that.\nPersonally, I don‚Äôt actually think it‚Äôs even that sexy. What‚Äôs sexy about saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here with my boobs out and a short skirt‚Ä¶ have a look at everything I‚Äôve got‚Äù? My idea of sexy is that less is more. The less you reveal the more people can wonder.‚Äô\nSure, let‚Äôs ignore the fact that she gave this quote eight years ago , when she was 18. For those critics, that quote has been stored away ever since, ready to be used as ammunition the second her neckline drops or skirt hem rises more than they deem properly feminist. In this moment, in their minds, all bets are off, meaning they apparently find it entirely appropriate to hold public, demeaning debates over her body. Whether or not this discussion between two British writers is tongue-in-cheek, it‚Äôs wholly dehumanizing:\n@gilescoren nice tits, though.\n‚Äî Julia Hartley-Brewer (@JuliaHB1) March 1, 2017 \n\n@JuliaHB1 bit small and flat. I like my ground-breaking intellectual gender warriors with proper have-your-eye-out-on-that bazookas.\n‚Äî Giles Coren (@gilescoren) March 1, 2017 \n\n@gilescoren well, I can at least deliver on that, er, front.\n‚Äî Julia Hartley-Brewer (@JuliaHB1) March 1, 2017 \n\nLet‚Äôs also, apparently, ignore the fact that this was one of many photographs in the profile. The pictures play on structure and form, and are pure art. Check out the gorgeous, refined couture look she‚Äôs delving into here:\n\n(photo via Tim Walker / Vanity Fair ) \n\n(photo via Tim Walker / Vanity Fair ) \nThe one being discussed is the only one that could be described as any degree of ‚Äúrevealing.‚Äù Of course, that shouldn‚Äôt matter in the slightest, because Emma Watson speaking out against the objectification and sexualization of women, and her deciding to show us a sexual part of herself in a magazine (or wherever she chooses) are not mutually exclusive, even if that had been the theme of the entire shoot, or every shoot. One does not make the other hypocrisy.\nWatson is highly conscious of hypocrisy. In this same Vanity Fair interview, she talks about her romantic life the way she has before, which is to say that she doesn‚Äôt talk about it, because if she did, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep others from talking about it on their terms. As she puts it,\nPrivacy for me is not an abstract idea‚Ä¶ I want to be consistent: I can‚Äôt talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You can‚Äôt have it both ways.\nSo sure, a lot of people are asking why this doesn‚Äôt apply to her body and her feminism as well. She doesn‚Äôt talk about her boyfriend because she doesn‚Äôt want other people talking about her boyfriend; so she can‚Äôt show us part of her body, strategically draped in a couture bolero, because then we deserve access to her entire, nude body, right?\nThat. Is. Not. How. This. Works.\nSexuality is not an all-or-nothing scenario. If you wear a bikini at the beach, you don‚Äôt get criticized for wearing a pantsuit to work. If you share your sexuality to a partner or literally anyone else that you choose, that does not mean you are expected to be sexual with every human on the planet. (Oh, hello rape culture.) There is one person who gets to determine what the limits of Emma Watson‚Äôs public displays of sexuality are, and how they fit into her view of herself as a woman and a feminist, and that person is‚Äìsay it with me, now‚ÄìEmma Watson.\n(image via Shutterstock)\nWant more stories like this?
