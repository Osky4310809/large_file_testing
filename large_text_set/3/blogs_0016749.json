This is my way of saying thank you for standing up for the children that are victims to scumbags like Fogle.”\nNigg, who is serving a 15-year sentence for being a felon in possession of a gun, pummeled Fogle in the prison recreation yard . Authorities said he left the convicted child porn watcher with a bloody nose and scratches to his neck.\nSEE ALSO \nPrison inmate beat up Jared Fogle because he hired bodyguards 0:0 The convicted felon who served a platter of knuckle sandwiches... The 61-year-old has been getting the letters sent to his new prison in Oklahoma , several of which were obtained by TMZ. They have been penned by men, women and in some cases, even children.\n“Good day Steven…I am writing this letter to thank you for your service,” said one little boy, who also sent $2.\n“What you did took courage,” he wrote.\nMost who wrote to Nigg said they would have done the same thing if they were in his shoes.\n“God bless you and know that there are many of us who stand shoulder to shoulder with you,” said one person. “Our society may have been too severely weakened these day to administer proper judicial punishment, but the American sense of integrity, when offended, will be satisfied in one way or another by courageous brothers who will stand up for the weak when they cannot defend themselves.”\nAnother fan wrote: “I’ve never written to a prisoner before but after reading your story, I had to tell you THANK YOU….Sorry you got put into solidarity but please know that myself AND my organization that works with child rape victims are very, very thankful for what you did….We all know that peace is the best way but again, in this case, thank you for what you did to that horrible rapist monster…Now stay out of trouble and we’ll keep praying for you.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:30:36.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
