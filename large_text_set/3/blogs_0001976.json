Advertisement - story continues below \n— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) March 2, 2017 \nThe White House , however, said that meeting was being mischaracterized as part of a political witch hunt. \nDuring his confirmation hearing, Sessions was asked by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. Advertisement - story continues below \n“I’m not aware of any of those activities,” Sessions said, adding, “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.” \nSessions and the White House drew a distinction between what Sessions did as a sitting U.S. senator and his role in the Trump campaign. \nOn Wednesday night, Sessions released a statement saying he “never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the [Trump] campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.” \nOn Thursday morning, he told NBC News , “I have not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaign, and those remarks are unbelievable to me and false, and I don’t have anything else to say about that.” Advertisement - story continues below Father Of First SEAL To Die During Trump Administration Demands Investigation \nNeither Sessions nor the White House denied the meeting with Kislyak, but said it had nothing to do with the Trump campaign. \n“There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,” said Sarah Isgur Flores, Sessions’ spokeswoman. “He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign – not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.” \n“This is the latest attack against the Trump Administration by partisan Democrats,” the White House said in a statement. “General Sessions met with the ambassador in an official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is entirely consistent with his testimony.” \nThe White House noted that the news followed hard on the heels of Trump’s well-received speech to a joint session of Congress \n“lt’s no surprise Senator AI Franken is pushing this story immediately following President Trump’s successful … address to the nation,” the statement said. \nSome Republicans said the latest news means Sessions should recuse himself from any investigation into the Trump’s campaign ties — or lack of them — with Russia. \n“If there is something there, and it goes up the chain of investigation, it is clear to me that Jeff Sessions, who is my dear friend, cannot make this decision about Trump,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “So they may be not – there may be nothing there, but if there’s something there if the FBI believes is criminal in nature, then, for sure, you need a special prosecutor. If that day ever comes, I’ll be the first one to say it needs to be somebody other than Jeff.” \nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had another solution in mind. \n“Jeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate,” she said. “Now, after lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the Attorney General must resign. Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country and must resign.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
