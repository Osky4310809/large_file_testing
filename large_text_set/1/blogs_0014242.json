Sterling, Sergio Aguero and then David Silva all wasted great openings. \nBut for all of City’s attacking threat, they do look vulnerable in defence. Sure enough, City were the architects of their own downfall on the first goal. \nCity full back Gael Clichy’s poor pass gave the ball to Davies, Kevin Mirallas’s precision cross found Lukaku and he fired past keeper Claudio Bravo. It was a lesson in clinical finishing.

But the game was over as a contest within two minutes of the restart. \nLukaku’s ball forward was only half intercepted by John Stones, Ross Barkley fed Mirallas who then fired a brilliant shot past Bravo into the far corner. \nNeedless to say, City defender Stones got a lot of stick on his return to Goodison. But what is harder to understand was the way some Everton fans seem to turn on Barkley. There were groans and howls of frustration after he misplaced one pass. A dejected John Stones (Photo: Getty Images) Barkley is tackled by Nicolas Otamendi (Photo: Alex Livesey) \nKoeman’s constant public digging out of Barkley has made him an easy target. Yet Barkley also provided the assist for Everton’s third goal after 79 minutes and, in fairness, he did get a warm reception when he was substituted late on. \nDavies, with his first senior goal for Everton, was the beneficiary of Barkley’s second assist as he coolly lifted the ball over Bravo. Then Lookman seized upon more uncertainty in the City defence with a brilliant finish through Bravo’s legs. \nThat brought Goodison Park to its feet and Guardiola to his knees. The feel good factor around the old stadium has given Everton a buzz but it was as bad as it can get for City. poll loading Will Manchester City win silverware this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T19:29:04.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
