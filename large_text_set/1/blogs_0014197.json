The phone is rumoured to be one of the first smartphones to boast Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 SoC. Now a new report from China suggests that there might be a MediaTek Helio X30-powered variant of the Mi 6 in the pipeline as well. \nA tipster on Weibo has posted that there will be as many as three variants of the Xiaomi Mi 6 flagship. The base variant will feature a MediaTek Helio X30 SoC, and will be priced at RMB 1,999, approx. Rs 19,700. The second model will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC and a flat display, which will be offered for RMB 2,499, around Rs 24,700. The third edition will have the same Snapdragon 835 processor, but will flaunt dual-edge curved display, and will be priced at RMB 2,999, approx. Rs 29,700. \nUnfortunately, the tipster didn’t provide the launch date for the Xiaomi Mi 6. As per the earlier reports, the phone could be unveiled at MWC in Barcelona next month. There’s no way to confirm the authenticity of these leaks, so it’s advisable to take the news with a pinch of salt for now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T08:51:37.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
