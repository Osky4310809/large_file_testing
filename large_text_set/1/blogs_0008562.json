It was taken in Danville, Virginia, in 1971, by the photographer Emmet Gowin, and the woman in question is his wife, Edith. The picture is so piercingly intimate that I find it difficult even to look at it. This is not because I feel as if I am intruding, or being shown something that I was not meant to see, but simply because it seems to hover too close to the vital force of human connection. It is too poignant, too alive. Rather than merely avoiding clichés—about love and intimacy, artist and muse, public and private—the picture seems to repel them, as an amulet repels evil spirits. Clichés are prophylactics against the complexity and intensity of direct experience, tools used to distance ourselves from reality, but this photograph brings love near enough that we can feel its hot breath.\nSee the rest of the story at newyorker.com \nRelated:\nPostscript: Ciro Roberto Bustos, 1932–2017 \nTrump and Celebrity Approval: You Can’t Always Get What You Want \nWhen John Berger Looked at Death ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:52:22.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
