Authorities say both were postal carriers at the West Market Post Office in Philadelphia and delivered mail in West Philadelphia. \nPolice say Williams and Charleston would leave their postal routes and transport packages to the members of the organization to distribute marijuana contained inside. \n“The vast majority of the Postal Service’s 600,000 employees nationwide are dedicated, hard-working individuals worthy of America’s trust,” said Monica Weyler of the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General. “However, a very small number of them choose to violate that trust by engaging in misconduct or criminal activity.” Ray Boyd Follow Ray Boyd is a Digital Content Producer for CBSPhilly.com, covering news, entertainment, sports and all the stories that impact the audience of CBS 3 and its sister stations.
