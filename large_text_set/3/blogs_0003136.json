(Brent Kennedy/Howard County Times) \nThe hosting Lions (20-3) overcame an early six-point deficit to cut the score, 15-10, after the first eight minutes. But defensively they did not have an answer for Mustangs' Sarah Blalock. \nThe senior forward led her team in the regional semifinal against Winters Mill with 26 points, and on Friday continued to have the hot hand. She knocked down 10 of 14 from the field and scored 20 of the Marriotts Ridgeâ€™s 28 second-half points. \nHer performance helped the Mustangs extended its cushion to 10 at the half, but Walkersville cut the difference down to eight entering the final eight minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T08:35:34.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
