Gen Olonisakin CDS \nOlonisakin spoke when he hosted participants of the Executive Intelligence Management Course 10 of the ISS, who were on a geo-strategic tour of notable security institutions in Abuja. \nRepresented by the Chief of Defence Policy and Plans, Air Vice Marshal Bashir Saidu, the Defence chief added that the strategic part of the ISS curriculum was very commendable and expressed satisfaction with the array of participants from various security agencies and regulatory bodies. \nHe noted that the inclusion of various government agencies gave room for cross-fertilisation of ideas. \nThe CDS noted that with the array of faculties in the institute, ISS was doing a lot to improve the knowledge of intelligence gathering of the participants, which could impact positively the ongoing war on insurgency and other allied criminalities in the country. \nSpeaking earlier, the Director ISS, Mr Matthew Seiyefa, said the choice of Defence Headquarters was in recognition of the military’s tremendous contributions to national security and nation building. \nHe further stated that the rising threat profile in the country could only be checkmated, if the intelligence community synergised with strategic security agencies as Defence Headquarters, to understand the operations and strategic interplays in the interest of national security. \nHighlights of the visit included a presentation on the roles and operational organisation of the Defence Headquarters as well as various military operations being carried out simultaneously to rid the country of terrorists and criminal elements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:38:57.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
