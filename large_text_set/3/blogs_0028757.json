Why not add a touch of nostalgia with a playable coffee-Pong table? \nA group of Pong fans in Uruguay last year created a real-life version of the classic title, garnering attention from gamers around the world. \nWhat started as a simple hobby has evolved into a commercial project—one that is currently more than halfway to it’s online crowdfunding goal. \nThe original concept, according to Kickstarter , was an arcade-sized table, about eight feet long, intended for use in bars, playrooms, and office spaces. A smaller, more functional model, however, would better suit everyday consumers, the creators decided. \n“We haven’t forgotten about this first prototype,” they wrote on the project page. “And it is in our interest to get back at it someday.” \nGerardo Orioli via Kickstarter\nThe final product—a multifunctional coffee table—allows owners to display magazines and books, rest their drinks or weary feet, charge up to four devices, stream music, and, of course, play Atari’s Pong. \nEach spin of the table-top controller sets into motion a series of pulleys, belts, and magnets hidden underneath, moving the paddles; the ball’s motions are guided the same way, bouncing off each wall of the game board. \nThere is also an integrated scoreboard and digital clock (like the one on VCRs of yore), and the edges of the play area are illuminated by multi-color LED lights. \nWhen not in use, the console transforms into a sleek coffee table by simply lifting the lids on either side. \nStanding at 28 inches wide, 19.2 inches tall, and 47.6 inches deep, the machine comes in four flavors: Classic (black with a giant Pong logo), Joe (classic black), Charlie (sleek brown), and Walter (silky grey). Folks can pre-order their Table Pong Project coffee table for an early-bird price of $1,100—a 35 percent discount from the retail cost of $1,690. \nAdd a pair of branded Atari seating cubes ($80) and a coin-op unit ($60) to really set the mood. \nReal fanatics can grab one of 10 collector-edition tables, signed by Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, for $5,000. Or, for the same price, snag five slabs for a bar, office, or mansion. The distributor pack includes 10 coffee tables for $9,000. \nThe Table Pong Project has 21 days to reach its all-or-nothing funding goal, at which point the team will move on to production, ahead of an expected December delivery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:23:55.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
