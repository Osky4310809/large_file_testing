The president alleged that Nordstrom treated his daughter “unfairly,” renewing concerns that he is using his platform to affect his family’s business interests. \nConway in her appearance said to “go buy” the products, adding that she would give them a “free commercial.” \n“It is noted that Ms. Conway made the statement in question in a light, off-handed manner while attempting to stand up for a person she believed had been unfairly treated and did so without nefarious motive or intent to benefit personally,” Passantino wrote in the letter to Shaub. \nHe said he met with Conway to review the ethics rules surrounding her position. \nHouse Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Ranking Member Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., both previously criticized Conway’s comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:10:01.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
