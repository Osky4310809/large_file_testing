Right from the iconic holi song sequence in Sholay , to the steamy scene in Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela , there have been some classic moments that we've all loved. As we get ready to go colour crazy again, here are some iconic B-town moments that you could put on that wishlist, and recreate this year. After all \" Dil toh Bollywood crazy hai ji \" 1. That super fun moment in Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani where Deepika Padukone steps out, get's her hand on a hose, and just goes crazy. 2. And that dance sequence, later, with Ranbir Kapoor was just the best. 3. Meeting a hottie like Ranveer Singh during your holi celebrations. 4. Going all desi , aka Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra in Waqt, and grooving to a (slightly mindless) number like Do me a favour let's play holi ... 5. Get totally high on bhaang , and groove on Rang Barse7. Stuck in the hostel this holiday? Take cue from Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, and get the entire batch to shake a leg. 8. Yes, holi means getting down and dirty. But that in no way means you can't look like a diva. 9. Get the family to come together, just like Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini in Baghban Gifs via Tumblr / Giphy / Photo via BCCL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T09:46:59.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
