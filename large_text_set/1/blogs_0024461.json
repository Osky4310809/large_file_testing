Diego Godin and Deyverson may face action from the Spanish FA after spitting at each other during Atletico Madrid’s 0-0 draw with Alaves on Saturday. \nAfter being caught by Godin's elbow late on, Deyverson was seen spitting in the Uruguayan defender's direction as the players jostled at a free-kick, before Godin returned the gesture moments later. \nThough Atletico captain Godin was booked for the initial elbow incident, neither spitting incident was noticed by the referee. \nTensions had been rising between the two players since half-time when Deyverson, who was incensed by the treatment Godin had given him, took his shirt off and offered it to the defender as the players walked off, gesturing that his strip was being pulled for the first 45 minutes. \nGodin had to be restrained by team-mates, before the late spitting incidents. \nThe game ended 0-0, with Atletico Madrid all-but out of the La Liga title race and now fighting for a top four place. \nWatch the incidents in the video above.
