A man standing outside his house told Byrd he was experiencing car trouble and asked if he could have water, reports  Inquisitr . Two armed men then appeared behind him wearing black clothing, ski masks and gloves. The trio pushed Byrd aside and entered their home while demanding money, reports  The Blaze . The alleged criminals reportedly took the elderly couple to the back of their home, where there is a safe, and told them to open it.\nBut Byrd realized he couldn't just sit by when he discovered the trio had other plans, as well: they reportedly intended to gang rape his teen granddaughter.\nUsing a gun that he retrieved from inside of his safe, the grandfather reportedly shot all three suspects and was shot in return by one of the men.\nThe suspects then fled the scene in Byrd’s Cadillac. Two of the men – identified as Brandon Carver Stephens and Jamar Hawkins -- sought treatment at a local hospital, where police reportedly apprehended them. The third suspect – 20-year-old Jamie Lee Faison, was found dead in the Cadillac.\nByrd, who is being hailed as a hero, was reportedly airlifted to a hospital and is in critical condition.\nSource:  Inquisitr ,  The Blaze \nPhoto Credit: Facebook, Flickr\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:07:27.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
