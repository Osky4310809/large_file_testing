After realizing Mr. Comunale was severely injured, Rackover, fearing arrest, stated, ‘we have to kill him,'” papers state.\nThe crazed former convict, who once served a stint in jail for burglary, brutally ensured that outcome, according to the filing.\n“Rackover choked Mr. Comunale before stabbing him in the head with a knife,” Bederow wrote of Dilione’s statements.\n“Mr. Comunale was placed in the bathtub, where Rackover unsuccessfully attempted to dismember him with a serrated blade. An enraged Rackover then stabbed Mr. Comunale several more times in the torso,” Bederow wrote.\nDilione, who acknowledged that the group had been drinking and snorting cocaine before the incident, told cops, “I didn’t kill Joe, it was James.”\nRackover has denied any involvement and claimed that Dilione and Comunale left the apartment and only Dilione returned, court papers show.\nBut his account is directly contradicted by video surveillance of the building.\nLawrence Dilione Steven Hirsch The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office hasn’t charged any of the defendants with murder — although prosecutors said they are treating the case as a homicide.\nThe new filing provides a detailed account of what happened the night of the Hofstra grad’s grisly end, and the men’s desperate efforts to clean up the crime scene and dispose of the body.\nDilione was out partying with Comunale when they and a group of friends headed to Rackover’s East 59th Street pad at about 5 a.m.\nVideo surveillance shows Comunale, wearing a quilted black jacket and jeans, and Dilione leaving the building for about three minutes, then returning at 7:39 a.m.\nHours later, after 6 p.m., Rackover and Dilione are captured on video surveillance in the building’s basement briefly entering the gym, then darting into the stairwell, court papers show.\nOnce back in the apartment, Rackover called building staff and asked for a luggage cart.\nHe’s shown on surveillance wheeling the cart, loaded with four duffle bags and a backpack, to the front of the building, where he transferred the cargo to the trunk of a Mercedes registered to the elder Rackover, court papers state.\nDilione told cops they drove to Oceanport, NJ, where they dumped the corpse, doused it in gasoline and set it ablaze in a shallow grave.\nCops combed through the garbage at the tony building and retrieved a cut-up black quilted jacket, cut-up jeans, a comforter with Rackover’s name, shrink wrap fashioned into rope with what appeared to be blood on it, and blood-soaked paper towels, the papers state.\nRackover and Dilione are each indicted on five counts of hindering the prosecution, concealment of a corpse and tampering with evidence. Gemma is charged with two counts: hindering prosecution and tampering with evidence.\nBederow argues that the prosecution’s case against Gemma is weak and based on his having changed his clothes before leaving Rackover’s apartment at 8:42 a.m., almost 10 hours before his co-defendants are seen scurrying around the building.\nSEE ALSO \nSuspect in party-goer's death 'not welcome' back at Midtown pad :0 The “surrogate son” of jeweler to the stars Jeffrey Rackover... Suspect in party-goer's death 'not welcome' back at Midtown pad He also questions why authorities didn’t execute a search warrant on the apartment that Dilione and Gemma share in New Jersey until nine days after the alleged murder. The search warrant didn’t even have the correct address, Bederow points out in the papers.\nWhile implicating himself and Rackover, Dilione cleared Gemma in interviews with cops. “Max had nothing to do with it,” he told them, according to Bederow.\nThe attorney called the charges against Gemma “the product of spillover prejudice from the damning evidence presented against Rackover and Dilione, combined with conjecture that he was complicit merely because he changed clothes before he left Rackover’s apartment.”\nThe lawyer suggested that Dilione’s statements would likely be tossed and evidence suppressed because cops interviewed him when they knew he had a lawyer.\nProsecutors haven’t referenced Dilione’s graphic description of the killing in court or filings.\nThe elder Rackover, who is pals with President-elect Donald Trump and helped him pick an engagement ring for wife Melania, took James under his wing about three years ago, lavishing him with gifts and setting him up in a posh apartment.\nThe celebrity jeweler has since distanced himself from the Florida ex-con , who changed his last name from Beaudoin to Rackover.\nHe’s being held on $1 million bond over $300,000 cash. Dilione is out on $300,000 bond while Gemma was released on $200,000 bond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:28:45.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
