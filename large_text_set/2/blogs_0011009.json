Source: FOX SPORTS \nMain storylines \nParis Saint-Germain host Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday with their Spanish coach Unai Emery desperate to improve his awful personal record against the Catalans. \nEmery was brought to the French capital last year as the successor to Laurent Blanc in order to help take PSG to the next level in Europe after four consecutive quarter-final exits in the Champions League. \nBut finishing second in their group behind Arsenal exposed the Qatar-owned club to a tougher draw in the first knockout round. \nNow they must beat the Spanish champions -- the return will be at the Camp Nou next month -- just to make it to the last eight again, and they will have to cope without skipper Thiago Silva in the first leg. \nEmery, the former Sevilla boss and multiple Europa League winner, has come up against Barcelona 23 times in his coaching career and won just once, in La Liga last season. Paris Saint-Germain's Brazilian defender Thiago Silva. Source: AFP \nParis, meanwhile, have been knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona twice in recent campaigns, losing in the quarter-finals in 2013 and again in 2015 to Lionel Messi, Neymar and co. \nThe French champions have beaten Barcelona in the recent past, claiming a 3-2 win in the group stage in September 2014. \nThey are also a formidable proposition at the Parc des Princes, having lost just once there in Europe in the last decade, albeit that was against Barcelona two years ago. \nSkipper Silva is set to miss the game after French media reported he did not train on Monday, having sat out the Bordeaux win due to a supposedly minor muscle problem. \nEmery will also be unable to utilise veteran midfielder Thiago Motta, the ex-Barcelona player, due to suspension. \nA dreadful ankle injury suffered by right-back Aleix Vidal has ruled him out for the rest of Barcelona’s season. \nJavier Mascherano and Arda Turan are sidelined too, although one man who could feature is Rafinha, who was named in the squad but will need a mask to protect a broken nose. Horror leg snaps in La Liga 1:21 \nKey match up: MSN v Cavani \nLuis Suarez is the La Liga’s top scorer and has seven goals in his last six games, but Kimpembe and Marquinhos have the enormous task of containing Lionel Messi - the competition’s top scorer with 10 - as well as Neymar and Suarez. \nPSG are fresh from a 3-0 victory at Bordeaux in Ligue 1 on Friday, in which Edinson Cavani scored twice to take him to 33 goals in all competitions this season. \n“Every time we play Barcelona we go out believing we can win, but things don’t always go the way we want them to go. What is for sure is that we are working hard and we are convinced we will have our part to play,” said Cavani, who turns 30 on the day of the game. Paris Saint-Germain's Uruguayan forward Edinson Cavani. Source: AFP \nCurrent form \nThere is certainly a new-found confidence at the Parc des Princes after a fine start to 2017 which has seen them win 10 and draw one of their last 11 games in all competitions. \nBarcelona travel to France buoyed by a crushing 6-0 win at Alaves in La Liga at the weekend in which Suarez scored twice. \nThat result means Luis Enrique’s side have now lost just once in 22 games. \nBENFICA v BORUSSIA DORTMUND \nEstádio da Luz, Wednesday 15 February, kick-off 6:45am AEDT \nMain storylines \nBorussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel hopes the return of the Champions League will provide the jolt his inconsistent side need ahead of Tuesday’s visit to Benfica in the first leg of their last-16 tie. \nTuesday’s fixture at the Estadio da Luz will be the first meeting between Benfica and Dortmund since the first round of the 1963/64 European Cup, a tie the German club won 6-2 on aggregate. \nBenfica, European champions in 1961 and 1962, advanced with the fewest points (eight) of any team to this season’s knockout phase and are looking to reach the quarter-finals for the third time in six years. Dortmund's head coach Thomas Tuchel gives instructions to his players. Source: AFP \nDortmund’s record-breaking 21-goal haul in the group stage was founded largely on thumping 6-0 and 8-4 wins over Poland’s Legia Warsaw, while they triumphed 2-1 over Sporting in Lisbon in October. \nDefender Luisao, who turned 36 on the eve of the match, is poised to make his 500th appearance for Benfica on Tuesday. \nKey match up: Aubameyang v Jonas \nVeteran Brazilian forward Jonas , who scored 32 times in Portugal last season, could make his first appearance in Europe this season after missing the group stage with an ankle injury. \nThe 32-year-old has netted eight goals in all competitions since his return from a four-month lay-off in mid-December, but Benfica coach Rui Vitoria admitted on Monday he was unsure whether the striker would play. \nBut the form of Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hasn’t been great recently. The Bundesliga’s top scorer with 17 goals managed just two shots on goal in 90 minutes against Darmstadt. Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Source: AP \nCurrent form \nDortmund tormented opposing defences and finished above European champions Real Madrid in Group F after setting a new group-stage goals record, but they have failed to reproduce their best form domestically. \nDortmund, who won their lone Champions League title in 1997, fell an alarming 15 points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich following Saturday’s shock 2-1 loss at bottom side Darmstadt. Benfica's Greek forward Konstantinos Mitroglou (R) . Source: AFP \nDortmund fielded three teenagers at Darmstadt, with 18-year-old Dzenis Burnic making his German league debut in the absence of injured defensive duo Marcel Schmelzer and Lukasz Piszczek. \nHowever, the pair are fit to return against Benfica while Ousmane Dembele could also start after coming off the bench at the weekend. Mario Goetze is not part of the squad though after struggling for both form and fitness recently. \nGreece striker Kostas Mitroglou scored twice as Benfica eased past Arouca 3-0 on Friday to remain one point clear of Porto at the top of the Portuguese league. \nREAL MADRID v NAPOLI \nSantiago Bernabéu, Thursday 16 February, kick-off 6:45am AEDT Real Madrid v Barcelona. Source: FOX SPORTS \nMain storylines \nDesperate Napoli fans have signed up as official Real Madrid supporters in a bid to attend a Champions League clash that will see an estimated 10,000 Neapolitans descend on the Spanish capital Wednesday. \nThe southerners’ first appearance in the last 16 of the competition since losing to Chelsea in 2012 has fans in a frenzy. \nAnd Naples’ mayor, Luigi De Magistris, is whipping it up. \n“I know the mayor of Madrid well... but we have to give them a nasty surprise on Wednesday,” De Magistris said in a video post on YouTube. \n“Spain is a great country, but Naples is better and we have to go there looking to win.” Along with Juventus, Napoli are supported by fans throughout the peninsula due to mass migration from the south during the post-war years to more industrial parts of Italy. \nAnd fans are going to extreme measures to reach the Spanish capital. Allocated only 3,917 tickets for the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, an estimated six thousand more Napoli fans want a piece of the action. \nThey have chartered planes, taken indirect flights via Istanbul, Zurich and Brussels and hired minibuses, according to widespread reports. Real pull away late 1:28 \nNapoli and Real have met only once in the competition, in 1987 when it was still the European Champions Clubs’ Cup. After a 1-1 draw in Naples, Real won the second leg of their first round tie 2-0 to advance. \nAnd the 11-times European champions are unbeaten in 11 consecutive Champions League games. \nAn upset of Zinedine Zidane’s giants on Wednesday would set Napoli up well for the second leg at the San Paolo, But again, the odds are against Maurizio Sarri’s men, who have a far poorer record in European competition compared to a ‘Galacticos’ side starring Cristiano Ronaldo. \nNapoli have won two and lost four of their six away matches against Spanish opponents in Europe, and won none of their last four against La Liga sides. \nIn his time with Juventus, former France international Zidane never lost in six meetings with Napoli, scoring twice against the Azzurri. Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ronaldo suffered a knock to his right leg, according to press reports, adding he was expected to shake off the injury in time to play Wednesday. \nDries Mertens has been Napoli’s main man with 21 goals this season following the departure of Gonzalo Higuain to Juventus. \nHowever, he’s been aided by the likes of Marek Hamsik (11 goals), Jose Callejon (8 goals), Insigne (7 goals) and Milik (7 goals). Napoli's forward from Belgium Dries Mertens. Source: AFP \nCurrent form \nNapoli, last season’s runners-up, are nine points behind Juventus in the Serie A title race but, with a league-topping 57 goals in 24 games, are playing arguably the best football in Italy. \nMadrid have won eight of their 12 fixtures since drawing with Dortmund on matchday six. \nSince then, they lifted the FIFA Club World Cup and set a Spanish record of 40 games unbeaten in all competitions which was ended by a 2-1 defeat at Sevilla last month. \nBAYERN MUNICH v ARSENAL \nSantiago Bernabéu, Thursday 16 February, kick-off 6:45am AEDT Bayern Munich v Arsenal. Source: FOX SPORTS \nMain storylines \nArsene Wenger is once again under pressure to end Arsenal’s Champions League last-16 misery as the Gunners travel to bogey team Bayern Munich in Wednesday’s first leg. \nThe teams know each other well, having met six times in the last four years, and Bayern thrashed the Gunners 5-1 in Munich in their previous meeting in November 2015. \nArsenal have suffered last-16 defeats in each of the last six seasons, losing to Bayern in both 2013 and 2014, and another early exit would further ramp up the pressure on 67-year-old Wenger to quit after 20 years in charge. \nThe Bavarians have reached the semi-final stage in Europe in each of the last three years, but Bayern are itching to go one better and reach the Cardiff final on June 3. \nXabi Alonso suffered an injury scare in training on Monday, while Bayern will be missing defender Jerome Boateng and winger Franck Ribery, who are recovering from shoulder and thigh injuries respectively. \nKey match up: Ozil v Lewandowski \nMidfielder Mesut Ozil is enduring a dip in form, though, and has not scored since early December. \n“It’s time for him to score again,” said Wenger. “I felt he did not feel confident (against Hull). \n“It’s always a problem because you think he can deliver something special.” Arsenal's Mesut Ozil (C). Source: AP \nGermany forward Thomas Mueller is enduring a goal drought with just one goal in 17 league games this term, but Robert Lewandowski has hit 23 goals in all competitions and is relishing the Arsenal showdown. \n“Everyone is waiting for this game and it’ll be a big challenge for us,” said Lewandowski. \n“Arsenal have very good players, but we need to concentrate on ourselves and if we play our best football, Arsenal probably won’t have many chances. \n“We need to score at least once and concede nothing, then it’ll be a good evening for us.” Sanchez's contentious goal 0:32 \nCurrent form \nBayern are riding a record 15-match home winning streak in Europe with the midweek clash marking the 11th meeting between the sides at Munich’s Allianz Arena in the Champions League. \nDespite their lead in the Bundesliga, Bayern have turned in below-par performances in recent weeks and needed two late goals to earn a 2-0 win at relegation-threatened Ingolstadt on Saturday. \nArsenal warmed up for their trip to Germany with a 2-0 win over Hull as Alexis Sanchez scored both goals to stop the rot following back-to-back league defeats to Chelsea and Watford. \nArsenal are third in the English Premier League, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, while Bayern are seven clear in Germany’s top flight.
