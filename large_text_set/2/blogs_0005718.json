Many popular tweaks have already received an update, such as Eclipse 4 which was released a few days back to bring dark mode to iOS 10. \nNow another popular tweak has been updated for iOS 10. Namely BioProtect, this tweak allows you to protect any of your apps with Touch ID or passcode. \nWith BioProtect, you can protect access to apps, folders, Control Center items, various settings and much more. It is the ultimate tweak for protecting your jailbroken iOS 10 device from unauthorized access. \nThe latest update of BioProtect is available right now in Cydia’s BigBoss repo. If you’ve purchased any older version of this tweak, then you can get this update for free. However, new users can buy BioProtect for $2.99. \nThe best part of this tweak is the fingerprint animation that is displayed when you’re using Touch ID for authentication. The tweak also allows you to use a passcode instead of Touch ID. This means that you can use this tweak on devices that don’t come with Touch ID such as iPhone 5. \nIf you’ve been looking for a way to protect your jailbroken device from unauthorized access, then BioProtect is the solid choice for you.
