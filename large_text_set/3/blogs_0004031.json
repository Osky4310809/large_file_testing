There are some matches on Sunday — with Goldberg taking on Kevin Owens for the Universal Championship belt and Roman Reigns taking on Braun Strowman in a match that could have some big WrestleMania implications. \nHere is the full list of matches from WWE Fastlane 2017, with the results and highlights being added in live as the matches are completed. \nSasha Banks vs. Nia Jax \nTag Team Championship — Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson (c) vs. Enzo Amore & Big Cass \nCruiserweight Championship — Neville (c) vs. Jack Gallagher \nSamoa Joe vs. Sami Zayn \nWomen’s Championship — Bayley (c) vs. Charlotte Flair \nRoman Reigns vs. Braun Strowman \nUniversal Championship — Kevin Owens (c) vs. Goldberg \nFans who follow along with the live results and highlights of WWE Fastlane 2017 could see a close glimpse of WrestleMania coming together. As CBS Sports noted, the WWE seems set on having Chris Jericho take on Kevin Owens at this year’s WrestleMania, but Sunday’s match between Owens and Goldberg could play an important role of that coming together. \n“Owens could win Sunday, perhaps with some interference from Brock Lesnar, and face Jericho for the universal title at ‘Mania with Jericho perhaps dropping the United States title at some point,” the report noted. “What seems more likely, though, is Owens falling to Goldberg, who would go on to defend the belt against Lesnar in a mega match. Whether Jericho played a role in Owens’ loss is irrelevant, but it would advance the rivalry.” #360WiseNews : Betting WWE Fastlane 2017: Goldberg Shrinks As Favorite, Roman Reigns A Big Underdog https://t.co/5iRlNFEAxV", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T02:24:01.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
