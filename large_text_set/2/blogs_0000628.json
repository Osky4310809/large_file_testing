Here though is a reminder of the pure, unadulterated joy that can be achieved through music.\nOver the last few years, a group if Italian musicians called “Rockin’1000″ have made a name for themselves by staging large-scale jam sessions of popular rock anthems. The idea rose out of a crowd-sourcing campaign to get Foo Fighters to play a concert in their small town of Cesena (one which proved rather successful ). Since then, they’ve staged similarly large performances of songs by The White Stripes, David Bowie, and The Black Keys.\nNow, “Rockin’1000″ has shared its latest feat: Nirvana ’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” as performed by 1,200 singers, guitarists, bassists, and drummers. As you can see above, the resulting pro-shot video is truly something to behold.\n \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:39:53.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
