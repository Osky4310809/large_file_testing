And Krauthammer did not see eye-to-eye with the Fox News host. \nRight away, Krauthammer took umbrage with O’Reilly’s theory that entertainers are frightened to perform for Trump because their careers might be harmed, telling the Bill that he “presented no evidence to that effect.” \nO’Reilly was apoplectic over the thought of Krauthammer not believing there’s pressure being put on specific entertainers. Krauthammer noted that there is a reason why conservatives set up their own think tanks in Washington as liberals controlled the cultural institutions and more liberals are involved in entertainment. \nWhen O’Reilly hit back and said Krauthammer was saying it was OK to deny someone a job for showing up to the Trump inauguration, he was given the following response: \nThey don’t want to play for Donald Trump. This is a republic. You are not summoned to perform for the king or for the dictator. In some places, if if they call you to sing, you better show up. \nO’Reilly went on to say Krauthammer knew nothing about Hollywood and they battled a little longer. This was just another in the line of classic O’Reilly/Krauthammer confrontations . \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:43:29.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
