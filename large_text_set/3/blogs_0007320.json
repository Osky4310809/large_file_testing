Tabulate that, and you’ll arrive at the brand’s latest supercar – the 720S – which makes its debut at the Geneva Motor Show. \nTaking over from the outgoing 650S , the new car features the brand’s new carbon fibre tub and upper structure, Monocage II. McLaren says the technology will deliver extreme strength and rigidity, while aluminium space frames carry the front and rear dual wishbone suspension. This setup is key to the 720S’ low dry weight of 1,283 kg, which is 18 kg lower than its predecessor. \nAtop this new platform, the styling of the 720S is not only striking but places a huge emphasis on aerodynamics. At the front, the car’s eye sockets not only plays host to the LED headlights and LED DRLs, but they also channel air down the sides of the car. The lower section of the front also sports anti-lift aero blades to keep the car stable at higher speeds. \nThe exterior also comes with McLaren’s well-known dihedral doors that feature a “double skin” construction. This eliminates the need for prominent side intakes, where the top section channels air to the side radiators. Meanwhile, the lower portion handles the turbulent lower body side air that comes off the front wheel. \nThe new door design opens wider (up to 80 degrees), making ingress and egress a much easier affair. It also opens 150 mm closer to the body to make sure that tight parking spaces don’t become a big problem for owners. \nInside, the purposeful interior is minimalistic in its design, with most of the controls pointed towards the driver. The main highlight here is the McLaren Driver Interface, which comprises a Folding Driver Display and Central Infotainment Screen. \nThe former allows drivers to choose between two modes – Full Display and Slim Display. The first one is a full-sized digital screen that displays the usual driving information with clear and crisp graphics. The other is for those who can do without distractions, whereby the screen folds forward to reveal a simplified and smaller display with just the most important information. \nAs for the Central Infotainment Screen, it is positioned on the centre stack, and handles most of the car’s functions like the air-conditioning system and telephony function. It is positioned right next to an array of knobs and buttons that control the car’s new Proactive Chassis Control system. \nThe system allows drivers to choose from several driving modes – Comfort, Sport and Track – and even a special one that lets you determine just how sideways you want to be before the car pulls you back in line (a la drift mode ). \nMoving on to the rear of the car, the teardrop cabin shape meets up with the active rear spoiler that raises and lowers as you would find in other McLaren models like the P1 and 675LT . From the rear deck, you’ll also get nice view of the engine bay, which is illuminated should you need a sneak peek in the middle of the night. \nBelow said feature, the twin-mounted exhaust tailpipes are positioned just beside the incredibly slim taillight “blades”. Move a little lower and you’ll notice the car’s diffuser element and low-slung engine, and what an engine it is. \nAn evolution of the previous 3.8 litre M838T mill, the new M840T engine in the 720S is 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 that churns out 720 PS at 7,500 rpm and 770 Nm of torque at 5,500 rpm. McLaren didn’t just bore out the engine and call it a day either, as 41% of the parts in the M840T is new. \nAll that power is sent to the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch SSG gearbox, which allows for some pretty blistering performance. The zero to 100 km/h quoted here is 2.9 seconds, while the opposite (100-0 km/h) is even quicker at 2.8 seconds. \nMore acceleration figures include 0-200 km/h in 7.8 seconds, 0-300 km/h in 21.4 seconds, and the standing quarter mile (400 m) is done and dusted in just 10.3 seconds. Flat out, the 720S will hit a maximum speed of 341 km/h. \nMcLaren has already started taking orders for the 720S, which retails at 208,600 pounds (RM1,133,174) in the United Kingdom. The brand offers three trim levels to choose from – standard, Performance and Luxury – which can be further enhanced with a range of option packs.
