Photo: Hackers, United Artists \nForget holding individual users to ransom , a hacker (or possibly group of hackers) is reportedly trying to extort Apple with their alleged access to a large number of iCloud and other Apple email accounts. \nIdentifying themselves as the “Turkish Crime Family,” the attacker(s) are demanding $75,000 in cryptocurrencies Bitcoin or Ethereum, or else $100,000 of iTunes gift cards. In exchange, they claim they will delete the data cache. \nIn a message to Motherboard , one of the hackers said that, “I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing.” \nAs supposed evidence, the hackers have sent emails of apparent email exchanged between themselves and Apple’s security team. They also uploaded a YouTube video concerning the hack. One of the messages sent by Apple’s security team apparently reads in part: “We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it’s seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law.”\nIf they’re not paid, the hackers claim that they will reset a number of iCloud accounts and remotely wipe various devices on April 7. In total, they claim to have access to up to 559 million accounts. \nIs this a genuine threat? Will Apple cave in and pay? We guess we’ve got a few more weeks until a bit more light can be shed on this sordid enterprise…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:58:41.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
