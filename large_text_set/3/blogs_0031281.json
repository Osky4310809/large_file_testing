Against the U.A.E., Irvine and James Troisi filled in admirably for the absent Tom Rogic and Aaron Mooy in attacking midfield, with Tim Cahill used as an impact substitute for in-form striker Juric. \nThe attacking philosophy looks as though it could soon pay dividends, but playing three at the back is a risky proposition -- particularly because Australia weren't strong defensively to begin with. Tuesday night was only the third clean sheet of their third-round campaign. \nIt means that in Russia the Aussies will be more than capable of scoring against the Germans -- they held the reigning world champions to 2-2 in Kaiserslautern in 2015 -- but the scoreline could well end up 5-4. \n\"Being in camp around Ange and the boys it is all about making sure we stay grounded and see the bigger process of what we are trying to do,\" Cahill explained earlier this week. \n\"The job ... [is] to play a style that's going to stand us in good stead heading into Confederations Cup.\" \nThe Confederations Cup will also see the Socceroos play a rematch with South American champions Chile, to whom they lost 3-1 in the 2014 World Cup. In that game in Cuiba, Australia were brazenly pushing for an equaliser in added time before substitute Jean Beausejour struck Chile's third in the 92nd minute. Ange Postecoglou will hope the Socceroos can maintain their good form going into the Confederations Cup. \nIt's this sort of fearless approach under Postecoglou that has some nervous Aussie fans wondering if the dull and conservative style of his predecessors Pim Verbeek and Holger Osieck wasn't so dire after all. Verbeek's qualification for the 2010 World Cup under Lucas Neill was a lot smoother than the wild ride for 2018 with Aston Villa's Mile Jedinak as captain. \nPostecoglou, however, has staunchly defended the way he and his coaching staff have set the Socceroos up to play. \n\"I've sat here for three-and-a-half years and I haven't changed in anything I've said I was going to do,\" the Aussie head coach said after Tuesday's win . \n\"I expect to be held accountable for what I say and the kind of football we want to play. But it seems I've been held accountable for doing what I said I'd do this week -- that's the bit I struggle with. \n\"Maybe if it was a foreign coach we'd all sit back and say, 'what a genius he is, he's coming up with new ways to challenge these guys.' \n\"But what I've found and what I said from day one is I will not talk down to our players. \n\"I will not speak to our players as if they're not as good as somebody else just because they're Australian and I certainly am not going to sell short our coaching staff and the way we work.\" The Socceroos came away with a comfortable 2-0 win over the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday night. \nWhat will please Postecoglou most about the victory over the U.A.E. will be the way that fringe players stepped up in the absence of missing stars like Rogic and Mooy. \nMore than two years have passed since Troisi scored the winning goal in the 2015 Asian Cup final to hand the Socceroos their first major trophy. He's barely featured on the international stage since then, after some ill-fated club moves. But since his return to Melbourne Victory in the A-League, the 28-year-old has struck a rich vein of form. \nBut many of Tuesday night's standout performers didn't feature in the Asian Cup, which illustrates how Postecoglou has a knack of developing new players, rather than clinging tightly to a familiar squad, as Verbeek and Osieck did. \nSmith has rarely featured for Bournemouth at left-back this season, but was arguably the Socceroos' best in the more advanced role where Brendan Rodgers gave him his Liverpool debut off the bench as a 19-year-old against Chelsea in 2013. \nThe versatile Irvine, who's with Burton Albion in the English second tier, was once better known as a defensive midfielder or even a centre-back. But the 24-year-old was full of confidence with a more attacking mindset as he gave Australia the comfort of a seventh-minute lead. \nIn the back three, Asian Cup hero Trent Sainsbury was accompanied by relative newcomers in Milos Degenek, of Yokohama F Marinos, and Preston's Bailey Wright, who negated the threat of the U.A.E.'s dangerous attacking trio Omar Abdulrahman, Ahmed Khalil and Ali Mabkhout. \nOf course, the bar will be raised much higher when Australia face up to the giants of world football in the Confederations Cup, starting with a June 19 meeting with the Germans in Sochi. It's a tournament where the Socceroos have performed well, finishing runners up behind Brazil in 1997, and coming third in 2001. \nThe Class of 2017 will be hard pressed to match that, with Portugal, Mexico and hosts Russia among the other teams in the tournament. But it should be an entertaining couple of weeks as Ange's Aussies throw caution to the wind. \nJason Dasey is ESPN FC Senior Editor in Singapore.
