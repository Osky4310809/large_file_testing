That exhaust is fitted to a 3.5 litre, supercharged, Toyota-sourced V6 engine producing 375 hp and 410 Nm of torque, the same as in the Sport 380. \nWhile the road-going Exige Sport 380 can be had with either a six-speed manual or an optional six-speed torque converter automatic, the Exige Race 380 features a six-speed sequential gearbox by Xtrac, along with a limited-slip differential and an oil cooler. \nAcceleration in the 0-96 km/h benchmark takes 3.2 seconds, while around Lotus’ home circuit in Hethel, the Race 380 clocks a time of 1 minute 23.5 seconds, 1.5 seconds quicker than the previous Exige Cup R. Rolling stock comprises 17-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels shod in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres measuring 215/45R17 in front and 265/35R18 at the back, while AP Racing brakes with four-piston front calipers take care of braking duties. \nGreater aerodynamic downforce contributes to its stronger circuit-lapping performance, with the front splitter, front dive planes, rear diffuser and rear wing helping accrue 240 kg of downforce at 273 km/h, with effective downforce also boosted by vents in the front and rear wheel arches helping reduce air pressure around the wheels. \nInside, the Exige Race 380 includes a full integrated roll cage, an FIA carbon-fibre, HANS-compatible driver seat with six-point harness, lightweight polycarbonate side windows, competition-spec fire extinguisher and battery isolator. A user-customisable colour TFT instrument cluster with programmable functions includes a track data logger and GPS unit to monitor on-track performance, with further upgrading to professional data analysis software possible. \nThe track-ready equipment list includes front and rear towing eyelets, carbon-fibre, louvred tailgate panel, and carbon-fibre air intake pods just ahead of the rear wheels. As is the case for a racing Lotus, the Exige Race 380 has no airbags and the headlamps have been replaced by matte black covers. \nLotus is now taking orders for the Exige Race 380, with prices starting from £99,500 (RM538,830) in the United Kingdom. \nGALLERY: Lotus Exige Sport 380 Research Lotus Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:21:13.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
