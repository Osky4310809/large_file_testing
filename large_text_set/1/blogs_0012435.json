He has again been supported strongly by Shadwell and Godolphin as well as some very prominent owner and commercial breeders; we're very thankful for their continued support. \n\"Muhaarar has developed into a very impressive stamp of a horse with strength and good looks that belie his easy and athletic action. With a top-class first book of mares and his own physical superiority, we are looking forward to his first crop of foals with confidence.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T11:21:14.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
