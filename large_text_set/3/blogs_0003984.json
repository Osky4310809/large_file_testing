Instead, after apologizing for a joke he said went too far, PewDiePie gave the middle finger to the Journal in an explosive video. \nSince then, PewDiePie's subscriber count has only grown, many YouTube stars have rallied around him , and he has said he's excited about the new opportunities he'll have as an independent creator. \nThis situation illustrates the complicated relationship between YouTube stars, their fans, and established media brands like Disney. Since 2005, YouTube has become the de facto launchpad for the next generation of celebrities. These stars rack up millions of subscribers and have a very direct relationship with fans. \nFrom comedians to gamers to beauty vloggers, YouTubers have generally built their followings outside of the control of media giants, even if they are signing big deals with those companies. And there is power and independence in having that huge fan base. \nTo get a closer look into which stars rule YouTube, we looked at the SocialBlade rankings to see who had the most subscribers. We only focused on independent YouTube stars, disregarding YouTube channels like mainstream music artists. \nHere is the new generation of superstars. \nNina Godlewski, Harrison Jacobs, and Maya Kosoff contributed to an earlier version of this post.
