[13] Max Speed (スピード Makkusu Supīdo ): Happy utilizes a considerable amount of Magic Power to fly as fast as he can. This speed can be used to dodge incoming attacks or to attack the enemy. A disadvantage of this technique would be rapid loss of Magic Power, in relation to how long Happy uses this technique. [14] Max Speed Attack (スピードアタック Makkusu Supīdo Atakku ): While using Max Speed, Happy flies as fast as he can, and then strikes the opponent with his own head. This attack was powerful enough to destroy a Thunder Palace Lacrima, which was about two or more times the size of Happy. [15] \nTransformation Magic (変身魔法 Henshin Mahō ): Mirajane taught Happy, Natsu and Lucy basic spells of Transformation Magic. [16] However, Happy is only able to transform into a super deformed version of Lucy. Unfortunately, his attempt was a failure and in Lucy's words, \"creepy\". [17] \nEnhanced Durability : Despite his small and seemingly frail stature, Happy has proven to possess incredible durability by surviving a city-wide explosion caused by Jackal, one of the Nine Demon Gates , despite being in the center of the explosion when it occurred. [18] Former Magic and Abilities Lucy Fire \nUshi no Koku Mairi (丑の刻参り Ushi no Koku Mairi ): During their fight against Kain, he catches the Mr. Cursey doll Natsu threw to him. While flying he used it, while it had Lucy's hair, delivered an attack on him. [19] Secret Attack: Lucy Fire (必殺・ルーシィファイア Hissatsu : Rūshi Faia ): While he was controlling Mr. Cursey and after Natsu had ignited Lucy, Happy used Max Speed to make Lucy's whole body catch on fire, and had her deliver a brutal kick to Kain Hikaru. [19] Equipment Happy fights using two big fish \nBackpack : A small green backpack that Happy uses to carry snacks. [20] \nFish (or other food products) : Happy is constantly seen using fish or fruits in battle. He uses them as blunt weapons, and also as swords. His range of \"weapons\" varies from fish to octopi to crabs. [21] Trivia Hiro Mashima was originally going to name Happy \"Freyr\" after the Norse god but didn't think it would suit his character. [22] From the Volume 16 Limited Edition: Sorcerer Interview , the best quality of Fairy Tail according to Happy was that \"Fairy Tail made the best fish entrees\"! He wants to see Igneel in the future. Has a good relationship with Natsu and Lucy. The hardest job Happy ever took was fishing for the Winged Fishes , which tasted horrible. [23] Quotes (To Lucy about Erza 's Magic) Erza's Magic is beautiful. Plenty of blood came out in the end. Her opponent's blood. [24] (To Nichiya and Nadi ) \"We're not your puppets!! We are... Mages of Fairy Tail!!!\" [25] (To Byro Cracy ) \" What kind of rightful cause makes people sad and suffer?! In Edolas, we saw a lot of people suffering and Exceeds going through hardships! A path that forces you to cause people pain and sacrifice them along the way is one that'll eventua lly fall to pieces and disappear! Is that the way you want everyone to go?! Even a fish is free to swim whenever it wants in the water, right?! Well, we're the same! We take requests from people who are in trouble and help them, so they can be happy and we get a reward. That's how we've been operating all along. That's what a guild does! Against you and that fake righteousness you hold over your head, Fairy Tail isn't gonna be beat! \" [26] (To Lucy Heartfilia (Future) ) \" I am sad! I don't care what world you're from! I don't care what anyone says! Lucy is Lucy! You're my friend! Of course I'm sad!\" \"You L ve him/her\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T09:19:48.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
