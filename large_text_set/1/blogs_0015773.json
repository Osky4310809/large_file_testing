Florissant Police Officer Steve Michael said Smith died at the scene. \nChief Tim Lowery said two officers fired a total of nine shots at Smith. The officers have 11 and 9 years on the force. He did not release the names of the officers involved. \nOfficials did not divulge any details about the shooting until a reporter inquired about it on Friday. \nLowery said his officers were surprised when no reporters arrived at the scene to cover the incident, so they focused solely on the investigation and informing the neighborhood of what happened. There was no press release issued after the fact. \n\"In hindsight, it should be issued because of transparency,\" Lowery said, adding that the department would issue a press release Friday. \"Our officers acted in a professional manner and a man lost his life at the hands of law enforcement, however, when presented with the circumstances, we didn't have a choice and we are grieving with the family.\" \nLowery said Smith kept coming at officers, who tried using a Taser and a bean bag round. \n\"Officers didn't have a choice with the large knife he had in his hand,\" the chief added. \nMichael, the department's public information officer, described Smith as having \"an unfortunate mental health issue.\" \nSmith had called police at 11:54 a.m. Thursday, \"having a mental health episode,\" Michael said. Michael did not elaborate on what Smith had said, but a source said Smith was threatening to kill his family. \nWhen officers arrived at the home on Bay Meadows, near North Waterford Drive, they tried calling the number Smith had given them, Michael said. When Smith answered, an officer asked if everything was okay. \n\"No, nothing is okay,\" Smith said, then hung up. \nSmith's mother came outside and told officers that her son was acting erratically and had chased her around the home with a knife. \nOfficers got other occupants out of the home safely; Michael said he didn't have information about how many people there were, but he said none was a child. He said no one in the home was injured. \nOfficers then went into the home, Michael said, and announced several times who they were. \nThey went into the basement and found a closed door. The officers ordered him to come out, Michael said, but he wouldn't. \nThe officers opened the door and saw Smith standing there \"with a large hunting-style knife above his head,\" Michael said. \nHe ignored officers' demands to drop the knife, and instead came at the officers, Michael said. \n\"He's charging out of the room, with the knife still in his hands,\" Michael said. \nMichael said the shooting is being investigated in-house by the Florissant Police Department, and that no outside agency is doing a separate investigation. \nLowery said the last officer-involved shooting in Florissant happened years ago, and his department of 100 officers has always handled its own lethal-force investigations. \n\"We feel confident in investigating our own shootings, just like the city does and the county,\" he said. \nRelatives of Smith could not be reached Friday. \nJoel Currier and Christine Byers of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:41:30.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
