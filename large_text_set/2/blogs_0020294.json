UG editor. Music lover. Constant searcher of something interesting and unique. Posted 13 hours ago 9 \nA recently discovered genus of extinct polychaetes (aka bristle worms) has been named \"Websteroprion Armstrongi\" in honor of the Cannibal Corpse bassist Alex Webster. \nThe study on it was published by Mats E. Eriksson of Lund University, Sweden, Luke A. Parry of Bristol University, U.K., and David M. Rudkin of Royal Ontario Museum via Scientific Reports . \nEriksson and Parry have both previously named fossilized species after famous rock/metal musicians in the past. In their paper they note of the etymology of the species: \"Named after Alex Webster - a 'giant' of a bass player - combined with 'prion' meaning saw.\" \nThe new species is unique among fossil worms and possessed the largest jaws ever recorded in this type of creature, reaching over one centimetre in length and easily visible to the naked eye. Typically, such fossil jaws are only a few millimetres in size and need to be studied using microscopes. \nDespite being only knows from the jaws, comparison with living species suggests that this animal achieved a body length in excess of a metre. \nAlex Webster himself took notice, offering: \"Thank you to Mats Eriksson, Luke Parry, & all involved, Iâ€™m honored! Congratulations on your discovery!\" \nHe also has shared the below video for a track from his side project Blotted Science, offering: \"Seems appropriate to share this today:\" The holotype of Websteroprion armstrongi.
