The meeting took place around the same time the House of Representatives made the the decision to delay the vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nThe decision came after Republicans realized they did not have enough votes in support of Obamacare's replacement, the American Health Care Act.\nBut just as the announcement was being made, President Trump hopped into one of the trucks parked in the White House lawn, hit the horn a couple of times, posed for pictures and waved at the press, according to the pool report by Baltimore Sun’s John Fritze.\n\nThe photos quickly went viral on social media, with several Twitter users making their best attempts to caption them.\n\"It'd be cool to have a terrible day at the office end with getting to honk a big truck horn,\" wrote one Twitter user.\n\"When this goddamn traffic is gonna make you miss Hannity again,\" wrote another.\n\"Tfw (that feel when) the @infowars intro music comes up on the radio,\" another Twitter user captioned the photo.\n\"I would offer this for a caption contest but I’m not sure if any caption could make it more poignant,\" wrote another.\nThe president also spoke to the group of truckers about Obamacare and the American Health Care Act.\n\"I know you had a big problem with Obamacare, and everybody does,\" President Trump told the crowd, according to the pool report. \"No one knows America like truckers know America. You see it every day. You see every hill, and you see every valley and you see every pothole in our roads that have to be rebuilt...\n\"Through day and night in all kinds of weather truckers course the arteries of our nation's highways. You carry anything and everything -- the food that stocks our shelves, the fuel that runs our cars and the steel that builds our cities.\"\n\"You think I wrote that? I want to save that paragraph,\" Trump said jokingly. \"But America depends on you. And you work very hard for America.\"\n\"Today, the House is voting to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare,\" Trump added. \"We'll see what happens. It's going to be a very close vote. By the way, it's close not because Obamacare's good -- it's close for politics. They know it's no good. Everybody knows it's no good. Only, politics. We have a great bill and I think we have a very good chance. But it's only politics.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:49:24.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
