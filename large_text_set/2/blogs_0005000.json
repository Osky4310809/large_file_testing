Matt Dunham/AP Brexit Secretary David Davis \nDespite heavy pressure from her London constituents to oppose the bill, Abbott decided to stay in the Shadow Cabinet and support Jeremy Corbyn’s call for his party to endorse the result of last year’s EU referendum. \nWhen a delighted Davis walked into the bar, he sought to congratulate her for supporting the Government legislation, which cleared its final Commons hurdle with a thumping majority of more than 372 votes. \nThe MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, a strong ‘Remain’ seat, had been mocked by Labour MPs for missing a key vote on the bill last week, citing a severe migraine. \nHuffPost UK understands she had a key meeting with Corbyn on Wednesday afternoon to discuss her future in the Shadow Cabinet. \nAbbott underlined her reluctance to back the Brexit bill as she was one of the very last MPs to walk through the voting lobbies on Wednesday night. Until the last minute, she told colleagues how torn she was over the decision. \nMinutes after the final vote, Abbott was in the bar with Shadow Attorney General Baroness Chakrabarti, the former Liberty chief who worked with Davis on civil liberties issues when he was in Opposition. PA/PA Wire The Brexit Bill vote announcement \nBut the Labour MP recoiled from Davis’s attempted embrace, issuing her expletive. Davis walked off, laughing, another source told HuffPost UK. It is unclear if Abbott was joking or was seriously displeased. \nStranger’s Bar is a well-used watering hole in the Commons, where MPs from all parties gather, particularly on the night of key votes. \nTory MPs were making toasts to their victory over the Brexit bill, while Labour counterparts were split between those who had backed it and those who rebelled against their party’s three-line whip ordering them to support the Government. \nSome 52 Labour MPs defied their whip, including former Business Secretary Clive Lewis, who quit his post. A further 13 Labour frontbenchers rebelled, but they may be allowed to remain in their jobs. \nCorbyn is planning a reshuffle of his top team on Thursday, with other posts due in coming days. PA/PA Archive Labour MP Clive Lewis \nShe told the BBC’s Newsnight that “This is not a Tony Benn Brexit, this is a Donald Trump Brexit”. \nBut in a statement issued in the early hours, she explained she had voted out of loyalty to Corbyn and in recognition of the democratic will of the British people in the EU referendum. \n“I campaigned for remain and still believe that it is not in our best interests to leave the European Union. However to say that because the vote went the wrong way we are going to ignore the votes of millions of people up and down the country, would be a blow to democracy. \n“This does not mean that we have to accept Brexit in the haphazard way in which it is being handed to us. I like many are rightfully concerned about Theresa May’s Brexit. A Brexit in accordance to Tory values.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:50:09.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
