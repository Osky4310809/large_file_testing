What they came up with was an amazing animatronic setup that can listen to speech via a computer interface, and then translate it into sign language. \nThis device takes the form of two 3D-printed hands, which are controlled by servos and a pair Arduino Unos . In addition to speech translation, the setup can sense hand motions using Leap Motion’s API, allowing it to mirror a person’s gestures. \nYou can read about the development process in Foley’s Medium write-up , including their first attempt at control using a single Mega board.
