The 18-year-old star just showed us her first bathing suit of 2017 and it’s a minimalist’s dream.\nWhile most of the country is dealing with storms, snow and freezing temperatures, Winter is rocking swimsuits like a pro on vacation.\nAfter spending New Years with her new boyfriend Levi Meaden, the Modern Family actress and her friends headed off to Bora Bora. They’ve been enjoying a great holiday of fun and lots of sun ever since.\nWhile we haven’t seen much of Winter since the new year began, she has finally returned to Instagram with a sexy and chic bathing suit shot. On Friday t he Los Angeles native posted a sassy picture of her rocking a simple black one-piece suit while hanging out in a boat.\n@jackgriffo \nA photo posted by ARIEL WINTER (@arielwinter) on Jan 6, 2017 at 7:49pm PST \nWinter looked both sophisticated and sexy in this classic one-piece and it’s giving us major style goals.\nWhile this is the first picture the young actress posted from her vacation, her friends have been posting up a storm.\nJack Griffo, shared a gorgeous picture of “The girls” on Thursday and again Winter looked perfect. The girls @arielwinter @jessiebergg \nA photo posted by Jack Griffo (@jackgriffo) on Jan 4, 2017 at 9:41am PST \nWe’re kind of obsessed with this tropical look the Sophia the First star is wearing here. She looks like a island goddess with her brown two-piece and flower head piece. Oh, and that water…can we go to Bora Bora right now?! \nIn addition to Griffo and Winter, fellow Modern Family star Nolan Gould, and Disney actor Luke Benward were seen living it up in the tropical destination.\nBoys of Bora Bora. Bout to lock it down \nA photo posted by Jack Griffo (@jackgriffo) on Jan 3, 2017 at 11:05am PST \nWe know it’s winter, but we’d much rather be living like the LA lady and her pals right now!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T01:10:26.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
