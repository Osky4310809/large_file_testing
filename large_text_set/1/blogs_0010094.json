The U.S. Department of Agriculture has also fined the company $270,000 for reportedly violating the Animal Welfare Act, though the company denied any misconduct.\nThe final Ringling Bros. performances will be held at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center in Providence, R.I., on May 7, and the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., on May 21.\nClick inside to see what else Kenneth had to say… \n“Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey has served as inspiration for all of the live entertainment produced at Feld Entertainment,” Kenneth added. “We learned from the circus, and applied those learnings to our other productions. Without Ringling Bros., we wouldn’t have the vibrant live entertainment company that we have today. Ringling Bros. will always be part of Feld Entertainment, and its spirit will live on in every production and project we do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T07:03:06.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
