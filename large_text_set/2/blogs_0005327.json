He is expected to miss an entire calendar year\nAn MRI on Thursday morning revealed Milwaukee Bucks forward Jabari Parker has torn the ACL in his left knee and will require surgery, according to ESPN’s Zach Lowe . Bucks coach Jason Kidd confirmed the news and said Parker could miss an entire calendar year. \nParker came up limp after his knee gave out on a non-contact incident while driving to the lane in the third quarter of Milwaukee’s 106-88 loss to the Miami Heat . The news is a devastating blow to a budding third-year scorer, who re-injured the same ACL he tore during his rookie year.\nThe 21-year-old Duke product was averaging a career-best 20.1 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game for the Bucks (22-29), who had just welcomed sharpshooter and perimeter scorer Khris Middleton back from a torn hamstring.\nThe injury likely dashes Milwaukee’s hopes of sneaking into the Eastern Conference playoff hunt. The Bucks currently sit 11th in the East and are just 1.5 games behind Detroit for the eighth seed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T21:51:43.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
