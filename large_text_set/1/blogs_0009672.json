According to Washington Post columnist Petula Dvorak (which, completely apart from the bad article, is an awesome name): Please, sisters, back away from the pink. Pink pussycat hats, sparkly signs, color-coordinated street theater — all of it is gleefully in the works for the upcoming Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21. And that scares me a little. Because all of this well-intentioned, she-power frippery can make this thing more Lilith Fair than Lilly Ledbetter. And the Women’s March of 2017 will be remembered as an unruly river of Pepto-Bismol roiling through the streets of the capital rather than a long overdue civil rights march. This is serious stuff. It’s about human rights. It’s about the way 51 percent of our nation’s population still gets less pay, less representation in elected office and in corporate corner offices, less access to health care, less safety and less respect that the other 49 percent of our deeply divided nation. The Women’s March needs grit, not gimmicks. […] Sorry, knitters. I know the pink hats with pussycat ears y’all are knitting for next week’s march are totally clever and cute and fun. They’re a smart and snarky middle finger to the incoming predator in chief, who somehow managed to win the presidency despite openly bragging about grabbing women by their genitals. But it also undercuts the message that the march is trying to send. Of course, as anyone with any sense of nuance will immediately wonder: why not both? Why can’t we have pussyhats and politics? Gimmicks and grit? Work and play? But furthermore, how about this: what if protests can’t actually succeed without the gimmicks? I know this is never comfortable for activists — including myself — to admit, but some types of social change require good marketing. (Not all — if that makes you unbearably uncomfortable, you can stick to things like reaching out to people one-on-one, but that still demands tact.) Good marketing doesn’t mean you have to be friendly, unobtrusive, or palatable! Sometimes it means just the opposite. Black Lives Matter succeeded in part because it catches your attention. When you see something like this, it demands that you look : Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images There’s a reason that banner says “BLACK LIVES MATTER” and not “THE POLICE MURDERS BLACK PEOPLE WITHOUT PROVOCATION AT AN ASTONISHINGLY HIGH RATE.” People do, in fact, criticize Black Lives Matter for being seemingly short on substance (“Don’t all lives matter?”), but all you have to do is google it or look at the hashtag and you’ll immediately find tons and tons of Black folks and allies explaining what the movement is and why it exists. And if you got curious enough to google it, a small part of the fight is already won. Of course, Black Lives Matter signs and pussyhats are very different in a lot of ways. But all successful movements have their symbols — some deadly serious, some hilarious, and many somewhere in between. Second, Dvorak is historically wrong with a lot of her examples. Occupy Wall Street didn’t fail, “goofy protests” and tent cities notwithstanding. (Also, what “goofy protests”? I went to Occupy protests in both Chicago and New York and have no idea what the fuck this is even supposed to mean.) Occupy brought “the 99 percent” into the popular lexicon and got pretty much everyone — left, right, and center — talking about economic inequality in a way I haven’t seen happen in my (admittedly-short) lifetime. Bernie Sanders borrowed much of that language and those principles for his primary campaign, flawed as it was, pulling the Democrats to the left and galvanizing significant public support for the idea of reducing income inequality. The fact that Wall Street continues to plunder the rest of America doesn’t mean Occupy failed. It means we’ve set up a system in which Wall Street and other moneyed interests have a disproportionate share of the political power and of course one protest movement isn’t going to just fix that. Anyone presuming to lecture us about political change ought to know it doesn’t happen right the fuck away, especially when things have deteriorated to the extent that they have. Dvorak is also wrong about bra burning. At the same time as she (correctly) points out that people use that trope to dismiss feminists, she also (again correctly) points out that feminists never actually burned any bras, and yet, somehow, bra burning is evidence that we shouldn’t make pussyhats? In this incredible own goal, Dvorak shows what we all know: people will always, always find ways to dismiss activists and protesters, whether our cause is feminism or environmentalism or income inequality. It didn’t even matter whether any bras were ever burned or not. It won’t matter if anyone wears pussyhats or sings “silly songs” or not. People will dismiss the Women’s March. But you know what? They’ll be talking about it. It’ll be a thorn in their side. And it will make a difference. She concludes that section: Yet because the idea of a burning bra was so lurid, it eclipsed the fact that in the 1960s, women couldn’t get a credit card without a husband’s signature, couldn’t serve on juries in all 50 states, weren’t allowed to study at some of the nation’s Ivy League schools, couldn’t get a prescription for birth control pills if they were unmarried, were paid 59 cents for every dollar that men earned and could easily be fired from a job if they got pregnant. …notice how women can now get credit cards without their husbands’ signatures, serve on juries in all 50 states, study at all of our nation’s Ivy League schools, and get prescriptions for birth control regardless of married status (there are other barriers, obviously, but that started happening much more recently). The wage gap is now narrower, at least for white women, and firing a pregnant woman isn’t nearly so easy, although it does happen. We’re working on it. So how, exactly, did the lurid idea of a burning bra — which again, feminists didn’t even do  — prevent women’s rights from advancing? Further, I can’t help but wonder how much of Dvorak’s rejection of pussyhats is based on the fact that they are pink and pink is bad because it is feminine. That’s a common second-wave feminist fallacy — (some) women (in some parts of the world, during a particular recent historical period) are expected to wear pink, therefore pink is bad. Come on. It’s 2017. Leave this sloppy reasoning in the 80s where it belongs. It’s misogynistic and we’re supposed to be against that, or something. Finally, I want to add a little note here about the fact that we will never, ever survive these next four or eight years if we don’t allow ourselves to have a little fucking fun. I mean, we might survive in the literal sense, if we are privileged and don’t have any disabilities or illnesses for which we’re about to lose our insurance coverage and so on, but it won’t be survival in the real sense. It won’t be a survival of the spirit. It won’t be a survival of our passion, our creativity, our hope, our sensuality, our vulnerability. We can’t turn every protest into a funeral march just because they’re trying to kill us. It’s too damn soon for that. They haven’t killed us yet. We can “make a difference with goofy hats, cheeky signs and silly songs.” We can do that at the same time as we “remind the world how powerful we are and demand to be heard.” Fuck these forced choices. Fuck this black-and-white thinking. Black and white is for Trump and his fans. We need all the colors.
