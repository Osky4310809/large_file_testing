When it doesn’t get this reset, your brain may tap into resources that might have otherwise been used for accurate emotion recognition for other, more vital tasks. As a result, your ability to ID subtle facial cues may suffer. \nNow, emotions like happiness and sadness are considered “social emotions,” the researchers noted. They’re different from emotions tied to threat perception, such as anger, fear, surprise and disgust. In the study, the participants were still able to recognize those four emotions accurately even when they were sleepy. \nThat might be because we’re wired to recognize those more primitive emotions in the case of danger, researcher William Killgore, Ph.D., said in a press release . Misreading those, in some instances, can actually be a life-or-death mistake. \nOn the other hand, simply not knowing when the person next to you is sad may not actually put yourself in any danger. But you may be at risk of being a jerk, because being about to “read” other people is part of social inclusion, according to the study. Think about it—would your girlfriend be pleased if you can’t suss out when she’s feeling bummed? \nThe good news is that if you get back on track with your sleep, those brain connections important in identifying subtle emotions can start start buzzing again. In the study, it only took one night of recovery sleep for participants to improve their emotion recognition skills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:35:12.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
