Associated Press Andy Brassell Featured Columnist February 22, 2017 For some, it is one of the more open-and-shut contests of the Champions League last-16 ties, but FC Porto's meeting with Juventus is replete with meaning. It goes beyond the four editions they have won between them, and even past the 1984 European Cup Winners' Cup final involving the pair — Porto's first major European final — which Juve won at FC Basel's St. Jakob Stadium. Instead, there is no looking beyond the coming together of Iker Casillas and Gianluigi Buffon , two of the greatest goalkeepers of their, or any, generation. It will be a veritable clash of the titans, perhaps even for the last time—at least excepting the return leg in Turin three weeks from now. Though there are three years between them (Buffon being the senior at 39, while Casillas will turn 36 in May), so much in their respective careers has been star-crossed. Both made their Champions League debuts as teenagers, and they are now two of the 29 players to have reached a century of appearances in the tournament. The pair are among only five goalkeepers to have reached the milestone. The others are Petr Cech, Victor Valdes and Oliver Kahn. In November, Buffon matched Casillas' international appearance record of 167 and—injury notwithstanding—will surpass it when Italy play Albania in a World Cup qualifier in March. You would expect that to be definitive even if Julen Lopetegui, Spain's head coach and the man who brought Casillas to Porto, has announced himself open to recalling the veteran for La Roja on more than one occasion this season, per Radio Marca (h/t Football Espana ). Buffon produced a masterclass in Juve's October win in Lyon. Laurent Cipriani/Associated Press/Associated Press They are both more than monuments to durability. They are synonymous with continued excellence and are sure to be influential in this tie, even if Buffon's side are heavy favourites. The Italian's reputation is still bulletproof, and on the rare occasions when he is questioned — as he was briefly back in the autumn — he always knows how to respond. Buffon's virtuoso display in the win at Lyon in October—as praised extensively by BT Sport pundits Rio Ferdinand and Harry Redknapp—came on the back of those expressions of doubt. Juve's man between the sticks responded as he always does, with clarity and class. \"I've heard many stupid things in recent weeks,\" he told Mediaset Premium after the game in France (h/t Goal ), \"but just one true comment: 'I expect more from Buffon.' That is true and I agreed with that wholeheartedly.\" Casillas, too, has had to cope with critics. Even more so, in fact. For those who felt his career was winding down to a low-key end after leaving Real Madrid in 2015, this season has been a sturdy riposte. It might be hard to argue that he is the best goalkeeper in the Primeira Liga (that honour must surely fall to Ederson, Benfica's brilliant young Brazilian), but he is statistically unimpeachable. No goalkeeper in Portugal has conceded less than his 11 in 22 matches. If there is little doubt that the Spaniard is protected by a fine defence, and a colossus of a defensive midfielder in Danilo, he has done a pretty fine job of reproducing his imperious best this season. Casillas has been the leader that Porto always assumed they were getting — inspiring and standing tall in the biggest matches. Iker Casillas has been in top form this season. Paulo Duarte/Associated Press/Associated Press His arrival was a controversial one, seemingly bucking Porto's famous moneyball approach of buying potential low and selling well-developed quality high. Though he signed on a free transfer, Casillas was by some distance the highest-paid player in Porto's history, earning an eye-watering (at least for Portugal) annual wage of €6 million, per Eco Diario (in Spanish). If we add to this the absence of any resale value, it was a difficult deal to decode. For some around the club, it was difficult to swallow at all, and it certainly affected the perception of some of Casillas' displays. The outlay was tough to justify with the team so lacking in other areas following the successive departures of the likes of Hulk, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho among others. Moreover, any slip was magnified, as was always likely to be the case, with Porto only facing real challenges in the four classicos against Benfica and Sporting CP, plus whichever European competition they faced. Being linked so closely with Lopetegui, his former goalkeeping coach for the national team, didn't help as the coach's star began to wane. Casillas' costly mistake against Dynamo Kiev in November 2015, setting up a Champions League choke, paved the way for the end of Lopetegui's reign. Unlike Buffon, Casillas has not shied away from responding to the brickbats on social media, most recently when Catalan newspaper El Mundo Deportivo mocked him for erring in the victory over Rio Ave, openly wondering where they'd been for the last five months, via O Jogo (in Portuguese). That is perhaps a necessity rather than a choice, with his marriage to reporter Sara Carbonero making stoic silence less of an option. Still, he, too, has responded best on the field. If Porto go on to take the Portuguese title this season, his stunning late save from Sebastian Coates which clinched victory over Sporting earlier this month will be considered a turning point. A photo posted by Bleacher Report UK (@bleacherreportuk) A repeat in this tie would truly catapult him into the constellation of Porto legend. For all the recent improvement of Nuno's side, it will still be a huge surprise if Buffon doesn't end up on the winning team. History doesn't favour Casillas, either. Despite the fact he holds the edge in their meetings at international level (with Spain winning three to Italy's one in their direct confrontations), Buffon has won on each of the three occasions that the pair have met in the knockout stages of the Champions League, per UEFA.com (in Spanish). With that said, there is little that Casillas hasn't seen at this level since making his impromptu debut for Real Madrid against Olympiakos as a 16-year-old, but even for him, this will surely be an occasion to stir the emotions. Here's to two of the European game's great survivors. It will be a while before we see their like again.
