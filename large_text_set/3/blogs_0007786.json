Again, symptomatic of Wenger’s later years. \nDitto Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. He has been playing half-decently of late, he can see a clever pass and was involved in the move that again saw Walcott in Neuer territory only for his progress to be terminated by Xabi Alonso’s intervention. \nThe additional assistant referee could see the whites of Theo’s eyes so was close enough to notice Alonso got a faint touch on the ball before wiping Walcott out. \nIt was still a let-off for a blasé Bayern, who had clearly considered this as much of a done deal as the rest of the world. \nA done deal it officially was early in the second half, thanks to Koscielny’s clumsy misjudgement and the Greek officials. \nThe Arsenal captain barged into Lewandowski as he shaped to shoot, Tasos Sidiropoulos awarded the penalty and brandished yellow. \nThe additional assistant referee had a word and yellow was upgraded to red.
