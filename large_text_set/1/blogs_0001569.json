After losing in 48 seconds to Amanda Nunes at UFC 207, Rousey's coach speculated that she would be stepping away from the octagon. The prevailing assumption has been that the WWE would be a perfect landing spot for the former bantamweight champion. \nThe WWE was one of the first to jump on board the Ronda Rousey hype train when she was a special guest backstage at SummerSlam in 2013.
