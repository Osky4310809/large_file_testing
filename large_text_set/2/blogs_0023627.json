Some of the photographs were used for propaganda purposes during the war to give the impression that the men, women and children were doing well in the camps. In recent decades some images, mostly by Dorothea Lange, have been published. But most of the 7,000 images in the National Archives and the Library of Congress were seldom seen until recently. Now about 170 images – many never before published – appear in “Un-American: The Incarceration of Japanese Americans During World War II” ( City Files Press ) by Richard Cahan and Michael Williams. It tells the stories of many of the Japanese-Americans in the pictures who endured the spartan relocation centers. The book also gives a detailed account of the photographers’ experiences.\nFeature More on internment\nA look back on Lens stories of Japanese internment camps.\nRarely Seen Photographs of Japanese Internment The project was started well before Donald J. Trump called during his presidential campaign for increased surveillance of Muslims in the United States and proposed barring entry to Muslims from abroad. But, Mr. Cahan said, the “shameful” internment of Japanese-Americans during the war shows that “America is capable of being un-American.”\nThe images made by photographers working for the government’s War Relocation Authority were tightly controlled. Photographs of barbed wire, machine gun-wielding guards or dissent within the camps were forbidden, and at least 26 images were marked “impounded.” Instead, photographs of resiliency and civic engagement in the camps were encouraged. Ms. Lange left after three months. Clem Albers, a newspaper photographer from San Francisco, departed after just one month in spring 1942. But their work was carried on by others, including Francis Stewart, Tom Parker and Charles Mace.\nPhoto A photograph that was marked impounded depicts military police officers checking their weapons at the Manzanar Relocation Center in California, where Japanese-Americans were interned during World War II.

But there is very little other photographic documentation of their incarceration. A major exception are the optimistic photographs made by Ansel Adams in the Manzanar Relocation Center in eastern California, which he let the War Relocation Authority use before donating them to the Library of Congress. Some are included in this book along with a brief history of the controversy over them.\nThe War Relocation Authority photographers worked during a time when the relocation had widespread popular support, and when racial hatred of Japanese-Americans, often stoked by newspapers and the American government, was rampant.\n“The story of this collection is that some truly remarkable photographers rose to the occasion despite intense pressure to not do such a good job,” Mr. Williams said. “Not only did they get the photographs, but they created these really powerful transcendent documents. They got up close.”\nAmong those who got closest was Hikaru Iwasaki, known as Carl, himself an inmate at the Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming during the war. Mr. Iwasaki, his mother, Hisako, and his younger sister, Akiko, were among those who were incarcerated at Heart Mountain in September 1942. Born in 1923, Mr. Iwasaki had taken a photography class and worked for his high school paper and yearbook in San Jose, Calif. He took a job in a photo studio, where he learned lighting techniques after his father’s death in 1940.\nPhoto Nearly 900 Japanese-American residents of Yolo County in California were moved out by train over two days. Credit Dorothea Lange/National Archives and Records Administration “When we headed to Heart Mountain, we did not know the destination,” Mr. Iwasaki said shortly before his death last year. “We arrived in the cold and we were issued Army pea coats.”\nBy the time the Iwasakis were sent to the camp, Ms. Lange and Clem Albers had left the War Relocation Authority. In 1943, Mr. Parker and Mr. Mace enlisted the young man as a darkroom technician in the War Relocation Authority’s Denver office. The next year, he was sent on a three-month train journey to more than 20 cities to photograph formerly incarcerated Japanese-Americans who had attained jobs away from the West and were being touted by the government as success stories.\nThe book recounts Mr. Iwasaki’s travels:\nThe cross-country trips must have been surreal for a young government employee who just a year before had been in an internment camp. Photographing in the South, he watched as black men and women were prohibited from using whites-only water fountains and movie theater entrances and saw how blacks knew they must sit in the back of the bus. Iwasaki did not know where to sit at first, but he soon learned. “I was able to sit anywhere.”\nPhoto The photographers Charles Mace, left, and Hikaru Iwaski looking over prints at the War Relocation Authority headquarters in Denver. Credit War Relocation Authority Mr. Iwasaki also made poignant photographs of the closing of the camps in 1945 and the return of some of the Japanese-Americans to their homes. That September, he photographed an older man in Poston, Ariz., receiving $25, a ticket home and modest travel expenses. (slide #23 )\nMr. Iwasaki’s mother and sister were released from Heart Mountain in June 1945, and they returned to San Jose. Mr. Iwasaki went on to a long career photographing for Time magazine, Life and Sports Illustrated. He spoke about his wartime experiences with Mr. Cahan last year.\n“I think most Americans don’t know anything about this” Mr. Iwasaki said. “That is the sad part.”", "external_links": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/blogs/23-lens-unamerican/23-lens-unamerican-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/blogs/23-lens-unamerican-embed1/23-lens-unamerican-embed1-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/blogs/23-lens-unamerican-embed3/23-lens-unamerican-embed3-thumbWide.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/blogs/23-lens-unamerican/23-lens-unamerican-blog480.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/blogs/23-lens-unamerican-embed2/23-lens-unamerican-embed2-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/blogs/23-lens-unamerican-embed2/23-lens-unamerican-embed2-blog480.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/blogs/23-lens-unamerican-embed1/23-lens-unamerican-embed1-blog480.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:57:53.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
