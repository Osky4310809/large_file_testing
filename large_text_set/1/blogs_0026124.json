Originally created as tangible sculptures, but gaining further popularity as 2D Instagram images, Watt’s Echoes are effortlessly compelling and cute in an alien-like way, but ultimately beg the question, what the hell are they really? Fortunately, the Australian artist has some answers: “The figure I sculpt could be likened to my familiars in a way; they are as much a part of me as I am of them. I feel like they’ve always been with me in some way, slowly building up a voice throughout my childhood and early adulthood that one day finally broke through my subconscious after having children and moving to the serenity of the forest .” A photo posted by (@mahlimae) on Oct 11, 2016 at 10:53pm PDT \nWatt calls them Echoes because she “sees them as reflections of each other, of the past, of memories, of the lost elements of our humanity, the sadness of our Earth… standing dormant in the shadows like empty, lifeless vessels, waiting for the moment when they inherit a soul,” the artist adds. A photo posted by (@mahlimae) on Jun 4, 2016 at 6:08pm PDT Beyond an innate creative ability, Watt’s largest influences are her everyday surroundings. Based in the Southern Tasmanian wilderness, a certain attunement with nature is clearly visible in her sprite-like figures: “I think living in an area of the world where you are effectively swaddled by nature is incredibly soothing to the mind, and a very powerful healing tool for the soul,” the artist tells The Creators Project. “There is something about being completely immersed in the wild in such a way that stirs something within us all. I find it difficult to not be inspired and have my frame of mind shifted by the nuances of my surroundings.” A photo posted by (@mahlimae) on Mar 15, 2016 at 12:53am PDT \n“The forest also provides more tangible sources of inspiration for me in the form of the organic offerings which I often find on my walks, such as discarded feathers, tiny skulls, dried lichen, skeleton leaves, abandoned nests, tufts of fur, and the like,” Watt elaborates. “Foraged objects have an energy all of their own, which often acts to guide my hand. And on occasions, the aesthetic of an entire piece can be built around a single shard of bone.” A photo posted by (@mahlimae) on Nov 12, 2015 at 10:22pm PST \nA photo posted by (@mahlimae) on Oct 12, 2014 at 10:39pm PDT \nView images of Nicole Watt’s inimitable Echo sculptures on her website , or alternatively, on her Instagram page . \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T04:11:24.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
