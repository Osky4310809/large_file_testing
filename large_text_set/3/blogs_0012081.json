So is Canada standing by Trudeau’s virtue-signaling, “pro-immigrant” pronouncements? Not like Trudeau and his Liberal Party would have you believe. In 2016, Canada turned back more Mexican immigrants than it had in several years combined. Those Mexicans who are allowed to enter the country, as Reuters notes, often end up deeply “disappointed” when they find that “tough border checks, hard-to-find jobs and fine-tuned enforcement policies mean it can be hard to enter and harder to stay.”   \nWell, that’s weird! \nI thought we were supposed to just let everyone in because it’s the nice thing to do? \nWe all know that liberals are hypocrites. \nHowever, it’s still baffling sometimes how dishonest they can be about things like this.   \nI wonder if Justin Trudeau would be cool with letting Syrian refugees live in his backyard?
