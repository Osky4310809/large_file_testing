While many have expressed their excitement and congratulations via Twitter, others have taken their celebrations to greater extremes, like the Grey’s Anatomy stars who recreated Beyoncé’s photo shoot together . Yes, Ellen Pompeo celebrated Camilla Luddington’s own pregnancy the day after she announced that she’s having a girl in the most relatable way. (Who wasn’t texting all their pregnant girlfriends asking them if they’d like to partake in a Bey-inspired photoshoot this week?)\nThe result is a truly hilarious video and it can now be declared that Pompeo is as big of a Beyoncé fan as the rest of the world. Watch as she aggressively (hysterically) directs a reluctant Luddington in the recreation:\nRG. When @ellenpompeo goes rogue directing... \nA video posted by Camilla Luddington (@camillaluddington) on Feb 3, 2017 at 2:04pm PST \nIn the Instagram video, Luddington seems reluctant to duplicate Beyonce’s now iconic pregnancy pic, but Pompeo has no doubt that it’s the perfect way to celebrate a simultaneous pregnancy. Because of course it is. \nArguing over whether this is really necessary @ellenpompeo \nA photo posted by Camilla Luddington (@camillaluddington) on Feb 3, 2017 at 3:42pm PST \nThe caption read, “arguing over whether this is really necessary.” But we totally know that the Grey’s ladies are having the time of their lives. In fact, their recreation actually looks pretty similar to the Queen Bey’s, so maybe Pompeo has a knack for this type of thing. The Hollywood Reporter recently reported that Pompeo will be directing Grey’s Anatomy this year for the first time, but something tells us that she has a knack for bossing actresses around— and having fun while doing it.\nGrey’ s Anatomy hairstylist Sha Page was also in attendance. Her caption for the shoot read, We can’t help but act a fool #welovebeyonce \nHopefully Beyoncé sees the Instagram homage because it seems like Camilla would be a great person to go through pregnancy with:\nSecond trimester energy is everything!!! Feels sooo good to be able to get my sweat on again! #pregnancypilates. *btw- let me just say I feel for a you fellow pregnant girls (or as like to call them 'warriors')- the first trimester kicked my ass and morning sickness is no joke (yes I STILL have it). Sending love to all of u ❤️ \nA photo posted by Camilla Luddington (@camillaluddington) on Nov 18, 2016 at 3:38pm PST \nAs Luddington celebrated a pregnancy milestone, she wrote on Instagram:\nbtw- let me just say I feel for a you fellow pregnant girls (or as like to call them ‘warriors’)- the first trimester kicked my ass and morning sickness is no joke (yes I STILL have it).
