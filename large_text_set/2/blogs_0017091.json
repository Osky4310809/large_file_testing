Some may have thought the LMDs would see their end with “Self Control” but the episode only proved how engrained the decoys were to the series. The show ended with the surprise revelation that only Daisy and Simmons were still human. With the help of LMD May, the pair were able to upload themselves into the Framework to discover what happened to their comrades, but the girls won’t like what they find. In the preview for the next Agents of SHIELD episode, fans learn what the third season’s next pod will be, and it is a sinister one. \nIn the preview, a series of shots can be seen, but the first are perhaps the most disconcerting. Daisy is seen waking up in a mysterious bedroom looking horrified, and fans soon learn why. A picture of Daisy and Grant Ward can be seen looking cozy together, and it is then fans realize that Framework houses a very different world than what they’ve seen before. \nFramework seems to be the world which would have existed if Hydra had taken over. There is no further information about the new story arc, but the preview makes the organization’s involvement quite clear. Instead of working for SHIELD, May finds herself working as higher-up for Hydra, and it seems like Ward will have a major hand in this world’s order. \nThe preview for the next episode of Agents of SHIELD can be seen above. The series will return in April. \nYou can check out the synopsis for tonight’s episode of Agents of SHIELD below: \nSHIELD IS OVERRUN BY LMDs; THERE IS NO ONE TO TRUST - Suspicion turns to paranoia when the team doesn’t know who can be trusted as more LMDs infiltrate SHIELD. \nThe regular cast features Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Agent Melinda May, Chloe Bennet as Daisy Johnson , Iain De Caestecker as Agent Leo Fitz, Elizabeth Henstridge as Agent Jemma Simmons, Henry Simmons as Agent Alphonso “Mack” MacKenzie, and John Hannah as Holden Radcliffe.
