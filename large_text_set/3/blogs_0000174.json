ADVERTISEMENT \nResponding police officers and forensic investigators recovered from Maruquin’s car numerous guns and ammunition and eight pieces of heat-sealed transparent sachets containing residues of suspected shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride). \nAt press time, investigators have yet to determine the reason for the attack. \nPolice record shows Maruquin was charged with murder and grave threat before the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor in Laoag City on Nov. 24, 2016. However, the case was dropped because the complainant and witness executed an affidavit of desistance.
