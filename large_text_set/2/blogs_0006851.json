Col. J.B. Brindle said the department was trying “to acquire a limited amount of leased space” in the building, the Washington Post reports. The tower is still home to First Lady Melania Trump and the couple’s ten year old son Barron.\nThe space is separate from where President Trump’s Secret Service detail is headquartered. Although parallel arrangements were made at President Obama’s Chicago home, the Pentagon’s move is likely to raise even more questions about the conflicts between President Trump’s past role as a businessman and his new one as Commander in Chief.\nCNN estimated that the leasing one floor of Trump Tower could cost approximately $1.5 million.\n[ Washington Post ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T15:34:57.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
