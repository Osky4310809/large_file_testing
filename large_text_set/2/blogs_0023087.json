The company has said that it is not connected to any threat or phishing attack. So, if you have been unexpectedly signed out of you Gmail account on your desktop or smartphone, all you need to do is follow some steps, instead of worrying about it. It is not a hack or a virus, and Google is investigating the issue. It will also send you a notification regarding the same if it happens to your account. Google product manager Crystal Cee, in a product forum, wrote: “We’ve gotten reports about some users being signed out of their accounts unexpectedly. We’re investigating, but not to worry: there is no indication that this is connected to any phishing or account security threats.” \nCee added that Google is continuously investigating the issue and asked users who face the issue, to sign back in the account again, at accounts.google.com. She said that if some users use the two-step verification process to log into their Gmail accounts, they could face some problem in getting the SMS code which is required. In that case, Cee asks such users to try again or use a backup code. Google even explained the same in a statement to Android Central. Meanwhile, in the forum, there are several complaints, related to the Gmail login issue but if they are directly in relation to the issue identified by Google, remains to be seen. \nAlso read | WhatsApp Status rolls out for all: Here’s how to ensure privacy on the app \nWhen you log back into the Gmail account, make sure you have HTTPS in your address bar, as it is a secure way to browse. You should also choose the two-step verification process. To enable the two-step verification process, you need to start Gmail on an internet browser. Then go to the top right to a circular area where you can see your image. Select the ‘My Account’ option in the settings tab. A My Account page will open on a different tab. There you need to go to sign-in and security which is right on top. Choose ‘Two-step verification’ after signing in to Google Displayed. Sign in again once you complete the process. Ensure that you have the backup codes which Google will give you, to access your Gmail account.
