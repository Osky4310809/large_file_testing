A Kodi for all devices \nThe most instantly notable difference will be to Kodi's visual interface. It's now split into three distinct styles, suited to different devices. \nIf you're using Kodi on the couch with a remote, you'll likely want to stick with the new Estuary UI (pictured up top), which cleans up the sofa-surfing interface to make it more easy to browse to your libraries of content and streaming sources. If you're using Kodi on a touchscreen device, the Estouchy skin is purpose built for prodding, while the Chorus2 UI is best suited to keyboard and mouse input. \nIn addition, improvements to the Kodi video engine now sees support for streaming formats including MPEG-DASH and RTMP. \nIt's worth noting that the Android version of Kodi waves goodbye to earlier versions of Google's OS, with Android 5.0 Lollipop now the oldest supported build of the operating system. It does however bring with it new support for DTS-HD, DTS-X, Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Atmos audio formats, while the Windows Store welcomes Kodi for the first time. These are the best Kodi boxes to try the new update with. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Gerald Lynch Gerald is Associate Editor of TechRadar, taking care of the site's news and features output.
