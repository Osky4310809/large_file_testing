Then Hawking revealed that Richard Branson had offered Hawking a seat on board the Virgin Galactic, and Hawking had accepted the offer immediately. Hawking also spoke on sending a nano probe similar to the breakthrough starshot , to the seven earth sized planets discovered by Nasa in orbit around an ultracool dwarf star known as Trappist-1, and the mystery of true love. The entire interview can be seen below, the stuff about going to space starts at 8:40.\n\nVirgin Galactic is in the process of testing its vehicles that takes humans into suborbital flights close to the boundary between the atmosphere of the Earth and Space. The SpaceShipTwo vehicle is a commercial passenger vehicle, with a capacity for seating six passengers apart from the two pilots. SpaceShipTwo is designed to be carried on the WhiteKnightTwo jet to an altitude of 50,000 feet and then release the jet in mid-air. The SpaceShipTwo then goes into space and lands back on the Earth like a conventional aircraft. A single ticket is said to cost around $250,000.\nSir Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic CEO George White.

Stephen Hawking has already got a taste of zero gravity on board a freefalling plane. The experience was organised by Zero Gravity Corp, the same company that provides zero gravity flights to train Nasa astronauts for space missions. The plane was equipped with an emergency medical center, and Hawking was accompanied by medical professionals to ensure that the flight would be safe for him. Hawking went through 8 zero gravity dives, instead of the planned 2. At that time itself, he had indicated that he wanted to go to space on board the Virgin Atlantic ships, according to a report in New Scientist .\nThe Dragon spacecraft which will take the first tourists to the moon.\nElon Musk and his company SpaceX have the support by Nasa for the most ambitious space tourism mission yet . Two unknown individuals have paid an undisclosed sum of money to SpaceX for a spaceflight that will go beyond the orbit of the Moon and return to Earth. The flight is to take place on board the Dragon spacecraft, which is usually used for resupply missions to the International Space Station. SpaceX is conducting preliminary health tests on the tourists, before the training period for manning the spacecraft during its journey. Looks like there are exciting times ahead for space tourism.\nThe post Stephen Hawking has accepted an offer by Richard Branson to visit space aboard a Virgin Galactic ship appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T11:41:16.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
