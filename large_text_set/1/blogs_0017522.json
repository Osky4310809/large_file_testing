Kylie says she'll take Joshua's surname (Photo: Getty) \n“Sasse is a great name. Kylie Sasse is a great name. It’s a great stage name. Kylie Minogue has never exactly tripped off the tongue. I’ll definitely be taking Sasse but there will be Minogue in there somewhere. Taking a different name makes a statement.” \nKylie and Joshua became engaged in February 2016: actor Josh proposed to her with a princess-cut diamond ring that was made in 1908. \n“For me, it’s perfect,” said Kylie. “I’m not the sort of girl who would wear a solitaire. He got exactly the right ring for me. I love it. I love wearing it and what it represents.” (Photo: FameFlynet.uk.com) Check out that beautiful ring!

Why should we? Why is it fair? Why are we more important than anyone else? It's not right and something's got to be done about it.\" \n\"I simply can't fathom on any level, whether it's moral, religious or anything, that I have the right to get married and to marry the person I love and that somebody else doesn't just because of their sexual orientation.\" \nDolly Parton, Scissor Sisters' frontman Jake Shears - who is a good friend of Kylie's - and actress Margot Robbie are among the names who have campaigned to change the law in Australia.
