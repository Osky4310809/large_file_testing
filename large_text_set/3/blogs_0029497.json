Architects Studio Dror envisioned a bold new urban park experience for a \"city with no Central Park\" -- Istanbul , Turkey. Studio Dror's goal was to \"design a love story between people and nature\" for their new \"Parkorman\" park, with numerous pathways, swings, hammocks and trampolines scattered throughout. \n\n\n\nThe design transforms the existing green space located six miles north of Istanbul's city center into a playground where visitors can create their own unique experiences. While providing clear paths and spaces, the park also allows people to be surprised by unexpected discoveries along their journey.\nRelated: Dallas is building one of America’s biggest urban nature parks \n\nThe park comprises five main zones, each with its own distinct qualities. The Loop features swings and hammocks suspended above the forest floor, while giant ball pits, inspired by Turkish spice markets, dominate The Pool. A footpath meanders through the forest and twists around tree trunks into giant loops with trampolines at the center in The Chords. A maze-like trail surrounded by sculptures, called The Grove, aims to encourage exploration, while a cube-shaped Fountain of Clarity envelops visitors in water.\n\n\n+ Studio Dror \n\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:39:44.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
