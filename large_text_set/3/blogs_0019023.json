The 22-year-old will have a year left on his contract after this season and has stalled on signing a new one, which has alerted the likes of Tottenham and Chelsea to his possible availability. \nRomelu Lukaku will have the final say on his future, under a deal he struck with Everton last summer. In talks with majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri and chairman Bill Kenwright, the Belgium international agreed to stay for one more season, and if Everton failed to qualify for the Champions League in the 2016-17 campaign, the Goodison club would not stand in the 23-year-old’s way. \nChelsea are preparing a £40million double swoop for Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva, two of the Monaco stars who helped knock Manchester City out of the Champions League last week.
