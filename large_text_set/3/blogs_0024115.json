It was, after all, the year of the celebrity grim reaper. \nWhen I heard he had died, I thought of the very brief time I spent with George Michael a few years earlier, at a gala at Elton John’s house. It was the White Tie and Tiaras Ball fundraiser for Elton’s AIDS charity, and I spent the night dressed to the nines, cavorting with Adam Lambert and Beth Ditto. \nWanting to tell George Michael how much he meant to me, I instead chose to remain collected and “peer-like”. I wanted him to know that he had made a difference, and that he was loved. I didn’t know that would be my only chance. Talented and unique: George Michael took a singular path to stardom Read more \nHe had a certain type of sadness about him at the fundraiser; a sort of depressive cloud above his head. We were at a fun and spirited affair and yet he seemed somber, quiet, removed. His sadness, I speculated to myself, may have been residue of how the media had treated him over the past decade and a half. The “lewd-act” scandal, and the consequent “outing”, the rumours of intoxication and drug abuse; the stories of his sexual exploits – they had all overshadowed his work as an incredible songwriter and performer. \nGeorge Michael was an earnest and sharp-witted pop auteur, who deserves much greater posthumous fanfare than he has received. He was a bold, intelligent and provocative gay man – but in the aftermath of his death, much of the coverage sanitised his life, playing down his queerness in a way that was not only disrespectful to his legacy, but harmful to the community at large. Singer, songwriter, pop superstar: George Michael dies aged 53 \nWith so few – alarmingly few – queer musicians in the pop landscape, we looked to George Michael for inspiration and acknowledgment. He should be upheld as a great storyteller whose beautiful voice expressed it all – pain, joy, humor, love. \nThere are many great artists who have a lane that they shine in and they stay in it (and rightfully so). But Michael could glide between a sexy dancefloor filler and an emotional anthem without over-reaching. He made me feel like I could do the same. He showed me that pop songs could be both incredibly personal and widely relatable, and that they could have depth. He was extremely hands-on in the studio, taking on the producer role on many of his records. He was exactly the kind of artist I wanted to grow into. The Guardian view on celebrity deaths: a dramatic meaning | Editorial Read more \nI had always hoped he would return with one more great body of work, full of earnest prose and social commentary. But then he was gone. What should have been a grand celebration of his illustrious career seemed to fizzle out very quickly. A couple of weekly tabloid covers, a few spins of Careless Whisper and Faith on throwback radio, and a couple of very mild and joyless award show tributes – Adele at the Grammy’s ; Chris Martin at the Brit Awards. Both are world-class entertainers capable of wowing audiences, but their somber “easy-listening” performances did little justice to the depth, celebration of life and sexual bravado of George Michael’s music. What a wasted opportunity, I thought. In a time of rising global fascism and xenophobia, wouldn’t a song like Freedom! ’90 have been perfect? \nAnd where were the gay artists at these tribute nights? Why weren’t they on the world stage, celebrating one of their own? Where was Elton John, Sam Smith or even Adam Lambert? And why are there less than a handful of gay artists with a wide enough reach to even possibly fill the position? \nI was frustrated and saddened to watch his sexuality swept aside, and his work made bland and safe. \nFollowing the bathroom scandal in 1998, the news media treated Michael as though he should grovel in shame. He responded with the single Outside , an ode to gay sex, with an accompanying video that featured disco-dancing policemen and revolving disco-ball urinals. He put his proverbial middle finger in the air and effectively proclaimed: “You will not degrade me, castrate me or shame me for living as a sexual being.” \nStill to this day in mainstream culture, gay men are often cast as the silly, clownish best-friend type – people seem to be more comfortable with that. The moment a gay man is perceived as being strong, sexual, unapologetic or dominant, the norm is threatened. Traditionally, the same applies to women. \nBut Michael ignored that confine much the same way Freddie Mercury did. In 1996, still yet to publicly comment on his sexuality, Michael released the stellar Older album – his first since 1990’s Listen Without Prejudice. The album was laced with lyrics about his lover, Anselmo Feleppa, who had died from an Aids-related brain haemorrhage. In Jesus to a Child, Michael sings: “I’m blessed, I know / Heaven sent, And Heaven stole / You smiled at me / Like Jesus to a child.” \nThe song peaked at #1 in the UK and Australia without anyone really knowing it was a song of gay love lost. The notion that his lover represented the warmth and acceptance of Jesus to him is so incredibly moving to me – and undoubtedly controversial to others. George Michael was a defiant gay icon. His memory must not be sanitised | Owen Jones Read more \nIn what was to be his final UK #1, Fastlove , he wrote about the need for untethered gratification as he mourned the loss of his love. “In the absence of security / Made my way into the night / Stupid cupid keeps on calling me / But I see nothing in his eyes / I miss my baby”. This song is so deeply entwined with the gay experience that to have it represented at the Grammy’s by Adele was an injustice. \nI adore Adele, have spent time with her, done shows with her, had her over to my house. I absolutely believe that she did this with the best of intentions, and out of her admiration for George Michael. But you can flip through the radio stations or sit and watch MTV for hours without hearing a single gay voice. We needed and deserved this opportunity to be acknowledged as a community, and to honour our own. \nGeorge put his life’s stories into pop music; his stories are our stories. We have a responsibility to spread those stories, to make sure they are not forgotten or rewritten, and we have to fight for a more prominent seat at the table. We need our allies to allow us to use our own voices to do so; we need to create space for other George Michaels to exist, and write songs that matter.
