Chukwuemeka’s flat is fenced and it is located behind the main building. \n“Four of them scaled the fence into the compound, while two remained in the Sienna car. One, among the four, who jumped into the compound, was hooded. They went straight to Rachel’s flat and used an axe to break down the door. \n“While inside, they asked Mr. and Mrs Chukwuma where Rachel was. One of them went straight into her room to grab her. She screamed and cried and was in her pyjamas, almost naked. \n“They didn’t ask for anything else. They didn’t demand for money, nothing They were not armed robbers.” \nSome residents also stated that Rachel was allowed to speak with her mother from the kidnappers’ den.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:42:57.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
