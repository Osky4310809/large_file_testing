[Sergio] shouldn't have been condemned to death in the street.\" \nReyes, who police said used the fake gun to rob a bodega of beer early Sunday, was shot after officers approached him a block away from the store. \nCredit: Facebook \nThe Medical Examiner's office said he was hit by 14 bullets. The NYPD said the three officers fired a total of 19 bullets after he pointed his fake weapon at them. \nMohamed Ali, 19, who was working behind the counter at Garden Deli at 185 Starr St., said Reyes had pointed the gun at him and told him to bag four six-packs of beer. He then tucked the fake gun in his belt and left, the worker said. \nA neighbor had already called the police and they were on scene within a few minutes, Ali said. Shots rang out just a minute or so after, he said. \nReyes's dad asked for the state's attorney general or Brooklyn's district attorney to head an investigation into what happened. \nThe attorney general's office said the shooting fell within the jurisdiction of the Brooklyn DA, a spokesman for whom said the incident is being reviewed. \nOutside the funeral at Ortiz Funeral Home on Havemeyer Street in Williamsburg, Reyes's classmates, teachers and family members came to say their goodbyes. \n\"He was a really, really good person in school,\" said his friend Uriel Santos, 17, a senior at Leadership and Public Service High School in the Financial District. \n\"He had all his credits, all his Regents done. He was headed somewhere. He was looking forward to going to college. He didn't want to follow the same life as his parents.\" \nSantos's older brother, Luis, another close friend of Reyes, said the teen wanted to be a social worker so he could help out neighborhood teens. \n\"He wanted to make a difference to the kids in the community,\" Luis Santos said. \"He wanted to help people, kids like us, teenagers. They need somebody.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:26:14.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
