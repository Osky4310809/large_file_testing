A source close to Kelly says the offer, which included $25 million per year for four years, came directly from Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Co-Chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox. \nOur sources tells us that New York Magazine reporter Gabriel Sherman‘s “scoop” on Tuesday that Kelly went begging for $25 million late in their negotiations talks is entirely inaccurate. We are told, unequivocally, that Kelly never even countered Fox’s generous $100 million offer, because she had made up her mind to move on. In fact, the Fox offer is far higher financially than the one she ultimately accepted from NBC. \nLate Tuesday morning, news broke that Kelly would be leaving Fox News after 12 years to head to NBC News, where she would have her own daytime talk show to discuss current events, an in-depth political show on Sundays, and a chance to be “in the mix” during special broadcasts for NBC. \nEither Kelly desperately wanted to make a change, or NBC backed up the Brinks truck to her front door. \nProbably both. \nNow, who fills Kelly’s coveted time slot?
