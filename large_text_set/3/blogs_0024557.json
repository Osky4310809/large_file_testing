He had to wait a few seconds for oncoming cars to pass. And that was a few seconds two long for the guy behind him, who pulled up on his bumper, revved his engine, and leaned on the horn. \nThe guy in the passenger seat two cars ahead was so shocked, he opened his door and leaned out to take a look at the imbecile behind him, never a good idea. And in this case, it was nearly fatal. Imbecile stepped on the gas and ran up onto the sidewalk to pass him on the right and speed off toward a stop light two blocks away. Someone could have been killed, and the entire episode was completely uncalled for. \nHave you been seeing more of this kind of thing lately? \nI feel like I have, and I can’t explain it. Do the angry fools who do this kind of thing feel more empowered to act out lately for some reason? \nI don’t know, and unfortunately I didn’t get the offender’s plate number. \nBut the cops are always asking us to report road rage, and now more than ever I think we need to draw the line and start turning these creeps in. \nAnd if you are one of them, seek professional help with your anger problem now. Because the rest of us are mad as hell and we aren’t going to take it anymore. \nListen to Jon’s commentary: Jon Keller Follow Follow Jon on Twitter E-Mail Jon Keller Jon Keller is WBZ-TV News' Political Analyst, and his \"Keller At Large\" reports on a wide range of topics are regularly featured during WBZ-TV News at 6PM and 11PM.
