Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 \nThis rally will be Trump’s first as sitting president and his first since concluding his post-election “thank you” tour in December. \nUnlike most presidents, Trump filed an official statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on the same day as his inauguration, meaning he had already raised enough money to qualify as an official 2020 presidential candidate.
