I’m learning to say it even if it’s too soon. \nI’m learning to speak up when I don’t agree — when I ask you why it took you too long to respond, when I ask you why you’re not trying to see me and when I tell you that I don’t believe you. \nI’m done fearing losing you by letting you get away with everything that hurts me, everything I’ll never do to you. \nI’m learning to accept you but also be honest with myself. I’m learning that if I continue to act this movie will eventually flop. \nIf I continue to hide behind my smile, I’ll eventually burst into tears and I’m learning to love people who don’t always make me cry. \nI’m learning to be honest with you and tell you how I want to be loved and if you can’t give me what I need I’m learning how to live without you.
