Fabinho is unlikely to come cheap, but it appears the club won't stand in the way of him moving on. Meanwhile, L'Equipe (h/t Get French Football News ) also reported Kingsley Coman is hoping to make his stay at Bayern Munich permanent, but City have approached the Bundesliga giants and indicated \" they are willing to pay â‚¬50 million\" (Â£43.1 million) for his services. Matthias Schrader/Associated Press Bayern have the option to buy him for â‚¬21 million (Â£18.1 million) this summer from Juventus at the conclusion of his two-year loan deal with the club. Coman is an excellent prospect, though injuries have restricted him to just 631 minutes on the pitch this season. Bayern could sell the 20-year-old to City for a healthy profit after activating their option to buy him, though that is said to be \"highly unlikely.\" As good as Coman is and has the potential to be, given City already have Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling impressing in wide positions this season, it won't be a disaster if they miss out on him this summer.
