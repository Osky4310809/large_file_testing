It was also noted that the crowds along the inaugural parade route were pretty sparse , with large sections with empty stands and few people. \nConsidering Trump’s constant boasts about the crowds he drew during the campaign at his rallies and his predictions that there would be record-setting crowds at this week’s ceremonies, the small crowds would seem to be an embarrassment to Trump’s ego. \nWell, the Associated Press likely felt that way too, as its political bureau sent out the following tweet: PHOTOS: President Donald Trump predicted a record-setting #Inauguration crowd. It didn't work out that way. https://t.co/bpMREFsv7I pic.twitter.com/SHIm4M9ko5 \n— AP Politics (@AP_Politics) January 20, 2017 \nOne wonders if Trump’s adversarial relationship with the media of late, with consideration being given to moving the press briefing room out of the White House and his targeting of reporters and outlets by calling them “fake news” had anything to do with this tweet. \nIt should also be noted that the National Park Service retweeted a New York Times correspondent making the same comparison.
