Well, it looks like she hasn't let that controversy slow her down one bit, as she just teamed up with Smashbox Cosmetics for a new line of Be Legendary Liquid Lip products . Naturally, she also crafted jaw-dropping lip art looks using the brand-new products, and man, are they a beaut! \nThese metallic liquid lip gels are high in shine — no mattes here! — and have a mirror-like finish. With one quick swipe, the highly saturated colors permeate your lips, giving you full coverage and a gloss-like sheen that makes you ready for an Instagram-worthy selfie — no filter required. \nThe lip goodies come in nine gorgeous shades and are now available on Smashbox.com and at Sephora, Ulta, Macy's, and Nordstrom for $24 each. Read on to see each shade of the lip gel itself, followed by the artistic pouty masterpieces Vlada created for this collection.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T10:15:17.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
