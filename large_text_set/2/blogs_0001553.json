This may be the last quarter we ever see this trend however as Services seem to blast off. \nThis growth all comes as Apple prepares to make the risky but potentially highly lucrative entrance into producing original digital content, though it will likely initially be bundled into the company’s Apple Music subscription. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:13:28.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
