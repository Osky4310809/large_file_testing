The district says racism will not be tolerated. \n“Prior to this incident being brought to light, the principal was starting a new project where they are bringing in a coach to create student-facilitated discussions around their experiences,” Thigpen said. \nThere will be a school board meeting Thursday at 7 p.m. Among other issues, officials will be discussing these allegations. \nSchool officials told CBS Sacramento that this isn’t the first time the teacher has been brought up on racist allegations. Parents said they with want to know the context of the lesson and why the flag was ever hanging. \n“There are upsetting things that have happened in our past. I would hope that he would teach them in a sensitive manner so that nobody is offended, but I do think it’s important that they be taught,” said Melissa Mooy, whose daughter is in the class. \nThis is the second round of problems for this teacher in less than three months. He made a comment during a history lesson that was highly offensive to an 8th grader and his family. \n“The teacher said equality, such as if you were to to hang one black person, you would have to hang all black people and that’s equality,” said Tyrie McIntyre in an interview back in November. \nThe example upset their son, who was the only black student in the classroom. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
