The API will let companies hook up professional broadcasting and video editing equipment to Twitter with more powerful integrations than Twitter’s existing Periscope Producer feature. \nThe forthcoming API was first reported last week by The Information . Now TechCrunch has learned the exact launch date is tomorrow morning and that Telestream, Wirecast, BrandLive, and Livestream Switcher are amongst the API partners that will help publishers use the API. Twitter declined to comment for this story \nOur source indicates that Twitter’s Live API will work similarly to the Facebook Live API that launched last April to connect professional equipment to the social medium. Big video cameras, editing boards, desktop editing software, satellite vans, and more will be able to broadcast directly to Twitter through the API. \nThis functionality goes deeper than Periscope Producer which merely provides a destination URL where users can send video from software like OBD or Wirecast. While Periscope Producer was designed to attract semi-pro web vloggers to Periscope without complicated engineering requirements, the Live video API will be much more customizable for larger publishing enterprises. \nTwitter added the ability to broadcast live straight from its main app in December, after downloads of its dedicated livestreaming app Periscope fell off . It also been signing deals to license big news and sports events like Thursday Night NFL games. But its Live content pipeline is still thin, and the Live API could be flexible enough to encourage broadcasting. \nTwitter is the natural home for live video, not Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat. It’s always been about now. This API could use convenience to offset its smaller scale and lure content creators and owners to put their first screen inside Twitter’s second screen. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:04:41.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
