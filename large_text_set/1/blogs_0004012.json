Look forward to what they will experience there: welcome to the real world! Our dressing rooms are not as luxurious as they have here... and they’ve got portakabins here at the moment.” Plymouth battled to a 0-0 draw on Merseyside (Photo: Michael Steele) \nAdams was overjoyed with his team’s defensive performance, and he believes Plymouth will have a chance of an even bigger shock in the return if they can repeat their staunch rearguard. \nAnd with the replay also on TV, then he cheekily suggested it may even earn the club a new stand. Asked if his team could win the replay, he replied: “I don’t know about that but we will give it a real go. \n“We defended brilliantly here - one of the best defensive performances Anfield has ever seen. We will have to defend like that again if we are going to have a chance.

Yippee. It is my responsibility, the line up, performance. We could have done better.
