Shares \nJan Willem Nijman (Vlambeer), Dominik Johann (Crows, Crows, Crows), Jukio Kallio (who makes much of Vlambeer's music), and Kitty Calis (Action Henk, Horizon: Zero Dawn) have teamed up to create Minit—a new so-called '60-second adventure' with a cool retro-infused, Undertale-like art style. This supergroup of indies has joined forces with indie publisher extraordinaire Devolver Digital . \nSo, besides looking pretty, what exactly is a 60-second adventure? It's quite simple, really. \"Minit is a peculiar little adventure played sixty seconds at a time,\" says Devolver Digital in a statement. \"Journey outside the comfort of your home to help unusual folk, uncover countless secrets, and overcome dangerous foes, all in hopes of lifting a rather unfortunate curse that ends each day after just one minute.\" \nHere's that brief blurb in moving pictures form: \nAs you can see there, the duck-billed protagonist appears to keel over after 60 seconds of running around in a bid to solve people's problems—something which sees he or she wielding a sword, climbing up lighthouses and making short work of petulant crabs, among other time-restricted duties. \nBeyond that, there's not much else to go on. Minit is due at some stage this year, though, so we'll likely find out more sooner rather than later.
