However, we were still able to do some work,” Rohr said on the Super Eagles official Twitter handle on Tuesday. \n“We’ve been able to see some new players and young Nigerian talents here in the U.K, who could be part of our group in the future.” \nAmong the new players who were in camp with the Eagles were Chelsea’s Ola Aina, Arsenal’s Chuba Akpom, Isaac Success of Watford, and Olanrewaju Kayode of Austria Wien. \nOthers are the duo of Joel Bazee of Hannover 96 and Tyronne Ebuehi of ADO Den Haag. \nRohr also revealed that he would return to Nigeria soon to scout for more players. \n“I will be back in Lagos next week to watch some Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) games and see some of our home stars in action as we continue to plan ahead.
