Experts on the isolated and nuclear capable country's missile program believe the claims to be credible. show chapters Friday, 6 Jan 2017 | 12:40 AM ET | 02:31 \nTrump on Jan. 2 tweeted, \"It won't happen!\" about North Korea's pursuit of a nuclear-tipped ICBM, although his precise meaning was unclear. The Pentagon has said it would not necessarily strike a test-launched ICBM if it did not pose a threat. \nThe Pentagon declined comment on its intelligence about the North Korea threat, but spokesman Peter Cook assured reporters that Washington's readiness would be not be diminished during the U.S. presidential transition, due to take place on Friday. \n\"I can't get into intelligence matters. I can't confirm what's been reported there,\" Cook told a news briefing. \n\"We would once again encourage North Korea not to engage in provocative actions that do nothing but destabilize the region.\" \nNew type of missile? \nSouth Korean intelligence agencies reported on Wednesday that they had recently spotted missile parts being transported, believed to be the lower-half of an ICBM, raising fears that a test-launch may be imminent, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper said, citing unidentified military sources. \n\"It was different from a conventional Musudan missile in its length and shape,\" the source told the Chosun Ilbo, referring to the Musudan intermediate-range missile tested by North Korea last year. \n\"It is possible they were moving it somewhere for assembly,\" the source said. show chapters Friday, 2 Dec 2016 | 8:29 AM ET | 00:37 \nA spokesman for South Korea's Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Roh Jae-cheon, told a regular news briefing that while the reports could not be confirmed, the military was monitoring North Korea's ICBM development. \nNorth Korea has in the past paraded mockups of a road-mobile missile believed to be an ICBM design dubbed the KN-08 by outside observers. It is also believed to have an upgraded version, the KN-14. \nA road-mobile ICBM, which could be kept hidden or movinguntil fired, would make tracking and stopping a North Korean missile launch significantly more difficult. \nThe suspected ICBM is made up of two parts under 15 metres (49 feet) long and is shorter than the KN-08 and KN-14, the Yonhap News Agency said, citing unidentified military sources. \n\"I don't recognize the missiles from this description,\" said Joshua Pollack, editor of the U.S.-based Nonproliferation Review. \"But as we saw in 2016, there's certainly a variety of active missile programs under way in North Korea\". \n\"It's also possible that they are simply conducting field exercises with no plans to launch, or the option to launch if decided,\" said Pollack. \nLast year, North Korea conducted a test of an ICBM engine made up of a cluster of smaller rockets, indicating it was working on an ICBM design. \nSeparately, the Washington-based think tank 38 North said on Thursday that operations at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility may have restarted. North Korea is believed to be able to reprocess plutonium at Yongbyon used in its nuclear warheads. \nFollow   Playing", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T03:07:55.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
