Tears flowed, the Joyce Center crowd was on its feet. A family reunion ensued.\n“It was a really good Christmas for our family,” Matt said.\nBut what may have made it even more significant was what proceeded it.\nWhile Bo was doing a tour in Afghanistan, he was helping his struggling younger brother, who spent most of his first two years in South Bend glued to the bench. The point guard from Point Pleasant High School on the Jersey Shore had tons of support around him — family members, teammates, coaches — but when it got really tough, when the frustration of not playing would mount, when the idea of transferring came up, he would rely on Bo. The conversations were low on fluff, but high on inspiration.\n“Your problems are not that bad,” Bo would tell him. “Suck it up. You can always have it worse.”\nWhile Matt, a 6-foot-1 junior guard and one of the country’s most improved players this season, was already off to a good start before Bo surprised him, he said it’s no coincidence he is having by far his best season knowing his brother is safe. Bo is back in the United States, currently stationed at Fort Hood in Texas, and will be moving to Florida soon to teach ROTC classes and get his Masters degree in a partnership between the University of Louisville and the Army.\nBo has been at a few more games, and he’s planning on attending the ACC Tournament at Barclays Center this week, and the NCAA Tournament the week after.\n“He’s definitely played a huge role in my mindset. His leadership qualities and the way he does things really stuck with me,” Matt said in a phone interview. “For me, to have a brother like that, to see the things he’s been doing, has definitely influenced me to reach out and do better things.”\nDespite the age difference (Bo is 26, Matt turns 21 next week), each describes the other as his best friend. It worked both ways. Matt helped Bo, too.\nMatt gave Bo something to look forward to in Afghanistan, whether it was a game or a video chat. He would watch as many games as possible, waking up at 3 a.m., just in case Matt got on the floor. He went nuts when Matt led Notre Dame to a win over Northwestern on Nov. 22 by scoring the game’s final five points, nearly waking everyone up in the middle of the night.\n“I was screaming, going crazy,” Bo recalled. “You would think something bad was going on.”\nBo wasn’t the only Farrell hard on his brother. Their dad, Robert, would tell him, “There’s a reason you’re not playing. You need to start being a dog in practice.” Bo told him to pick out one thing a day to get better at until he felt it was perfected.\nThe Farrell family is big on tough love. Even now, Matt said, his dad, who attends every game, will begin their conversations saying what he didn’t do well.\n“We don’t sugarcoat anything in our family,” Bo said. “It’s not about hurt feelings, it’s about getting better. Sometimes you need that constructive criticism.”\nIt pushed Matt and, he said, has led to this memorable season. His rise started in, of all places, the NCAA Tournament last March. Wanting to free up lead guard Demetrius Jackson, Notre Dame coach Mike Brey started Farrell in the Irish’s four tournament games, and he helped them reach the Elite Eight, averaging 6.5 points and 3.5 assists in 26.7 minutes per game, dwarfing his regular-season numbers.\nMatt Farrell Shutterstock As encouraged as he was, he still was unsure where he stood. But his exit meeting with Brey set the record straight. Jackson was leaving for the NBA, and Matt was going to be asked to continue the recent Notre Dame tradition of elite point guards who waited their turn and took advantage of the opportunity.\n“You got the keys to the car, buddy,” the Notre Dame coach told him. “It’s yours.”\n“I think he bounced out of my office,” Brey said with a laugh.\nHe got off to a fast start, leading Notre Dame to the Legends Classic title at Barclays Center in November, averaging 19 points and six assists in wins over Colorado and Northwestern. He’s been the 19th-ranked Irish’s rock, the team leader in assists (5.5) and steals (1.5), third in scoring (14.2), tied for first in 3-point shooting (42 percent) and second in free-throw shooting (83 percent).\nBrey saw all of this early in Matt’s freshman year. He wasn’t playing, blocked by Jackson and former Notre Dame star Jerian Grant. But in practice, playing with the second team, Matt always made a difference. They would run simulated scrimmages Brey called “game situations,” and Matt’s team always won.\n“He was such a little pain in the ass,” the coach recalled. “We couldn’t stop him. He would make a big shot, drive and dish to make a big play. It’s only fitting, when you think about [all of our] close wins.\n“He’s just made for the moment.”\nThere are big ones coming up, starting with this week’s ACC Tournament. And Matt will have Bo in the crowd rooting him on.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T05:42:40.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
