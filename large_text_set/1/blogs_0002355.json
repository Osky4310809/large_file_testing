His bond has been set at $37,500.\n\"Whether someone is a professional athlete, a blue-collar worker or homeless, our staff will treat them with respect and we expect the same,\" Sheriff Jim Neil said in a press release. \"Regardless of who they are, if they endanger my deputies, our medical staff or themselves, we will take action.\"\nPJ Combs, a spokesman for the Bengals, would not comment on the incident.\n\"The (Bengals) considers it inappropriate to comment on ongoing legal matters,” Combs said.\nJones is no stranger to the court system. In 2006 he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct when he spit on a woman’s face in a nightclub. He also allegedly did the same thing in October 2016.\nIn 2007, Jones was ordered to pay $11 million in damages to Las Vegas strip club employees that were injured when a lone gunman, claiming to be acting at Jones’ bidding, opened fire outside the club, ESPN reported.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T19:53:47.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
