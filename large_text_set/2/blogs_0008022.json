Steam Cleaner takes care of them all for you. Advertisement \nThink of Steam Cleaner as CCleaner, but just for your games—and if you’re like me, those games can take up a huge amount of space. That said, you also need to take as much care with it as you would with CCleaner, and make sure you’re not randomly deleting everything is suggests. In our tests Steam Cleaner is pretty conservative with what it’ll scrub out, and only targets things like redistributables that you already have or are shared between games, or files left behind after you’ve uninstalled a title that Steam doesn’t delete for one reason or another. You do, however, have to make sure those left behind files aren’t save games or anything. \nSteam Cleaner has been around for a while, in both installable and portable versions, completely free, Windows-only. Give it a try and see how much space it clears up for you.
