As her father moved from post to post in the British colonial administration, she documented the family’s travels in sketches and watercolours. \nThe doubts raised by her great-grandson soon snowballed into a two-year investigation that sought to tackle “a bit of a museum mystery”, said Matthie. “We quickly discovered there was no real historical proof for either of those attributions,” said Matthie.

And there was no evidence that Charles L Daly had ever visited Prince Edward Island, making it unlikely that he was behind the detailed sketches and paintings of the island’s landscape. \n“The previous attributions felt like trying to pound mismatching pieces of a puzzle together just to make it fit a story,” said Matthie. “And as soon as we began looking into Caroline Louisa Daly, the puzzle pieces just started to fit together so naturally.” \nStylistic similarities linked her previously known works to those in the gallery’s collection, from the way in which trees were rendered to the emphasis on details. “When you look at the works all together, there are just little hallmarks of the same person coming through all of them,” said Matthie. \nGiven the time that Daly once spent on the island, it was surprising that the misattribution endured for so long, said Matthie. “But I think that it’s representative of a wider trend to ignore the accomplishments of women and kind of downplay them,” she added. “I don’t think it was a malicious misattribution by any means, but I think it’s just all too easy to forget the accomplishments of women sometimes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:17:26.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
