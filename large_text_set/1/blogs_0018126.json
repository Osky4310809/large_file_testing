The increase came from an additional $1 million in performance share units.\nThe board “took into account the firm’s strong performance” in setting Dimon’s pay, the company said.\nLast year, JPMorgan’s profit rose 1%, to nearly $25 billion. Return on tangible common equity, a key measure of profitability and a factor in the compensation, was 13% for the third consecutive year.\nShares of JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, rose 2016 by 31% in 2016, compared with a 26% gain in the KBW bank stock index.\nDimon’s pay has been a sensitive topic for JPMorgan.\nFor more on JPMorgan, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nThe company changed its practices last year to tie more of his compensation to objective measures of performance and leave less leeway for judgment by directors. The decision came after investors and proxy voting advisers complained that Dimon’s pay was too arbitrary. Shareholders voted to endorse the new structure at their annual meeting in May.\nDirectors are expected to describe their rationale for Dimon’s 2016 package in more detail in a proxy statement ahead of this year’s annual meeting.\nOther top JPMorgan executives are paid with a somewhat different mix of salary, cash and stock-related incentives. The performance pieces are like last year’s and almost all consist of 40% cash, 30% performance share units and 30% restricted stock units, a company spokesman said on Thursday.\nApplying the formula to other disclosures made on Thursday, they would receive total compensation of the following amounts:\nAshley Bacon, chief risk officer, $11 million.\nMary Erdoes, asset management chief executive, $19 million.\nMarianne Lake, chief financial officer, $12.5 million.\nDouglas Petno, commercial bank chief executive, $11 million.\nDaniel Pinto, chief executive for corporate and investment banking, $19 million.\nGordon Smith, consumer banking chief executive, $19 million.\nMatthew Zames, chief operating officer, $19 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T10:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T06:44:53.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
