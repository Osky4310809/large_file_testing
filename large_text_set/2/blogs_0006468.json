The 6-foot-1, 195-pound Lingard is ranked as the No. 2 running back in the country by 247Sports. \n“I’ve been thinking about the University of Miami for the past year now and every time I take a visit down there it was better and better,” Lingard said. “The opportunities I can have down there are very widespread compared to some of the other schools that I had in mind. \n“I like, away from football, how the student body carries themselves as wanting to be the best and keep the brand of the U as top-tier. I spoke with the business administrators and that side of it, and they want the best for the people, the students. It’s a school, but you don’t feel locked down in a school. I’ve been in school for basically my whole life and I at least want to go somewhere that it doesn’t feel like I’m still bunkered down in school. That was one of the main parts of it.” Video: Interview with Lorenzo Lingard, Orange City University 2018 running back \nVideo: Interview with Lorenzo Lingard, Orange City University 2018 running back \nVideo: Interview with Lorenzo Lingard, Orange City University 2018 running back See more videos \nThough he is only in his junior year of high school Lingard has been through the recruiting rigors. \n“It feels pretty good to get it over with,” Lingard said. “I just wanted to get the weight off my chest.” \nAnd, of course, with the weight and stress involved, recruiting sometimes overtakes a person’s life … and his dreams. \n“I guess I told myself, ‘Now you are hallucinating about it and dreaming about it, you might as well go ahead and get the job done,” Lingard said. “Like last week I had a dream that I was in the weight room lifting and somebody was saying something about Miami sucks and this and that and I got into an argument with them, defending Miami … It was pretty funny.” \nHis main recruiter at Miami has been offensive coordinator/running backs coach Thomas Brown. \n“From the start, when he met me he didn’t beat around the bush and he was really straight-forward and I saw his honesty from Day 1. Whenever he got in contact with me it was always the same, nothing changed,” Lingard said. “It wasn’t no hoot-and-holler. It was the same story, always.” \nLingard said he also has had a good relationship with head coach Mark Richt that stretches all the way back to when Richt first started recruiting him while at Georgia and Lingard was in eighth grade. \nLingard has put up big numbers at Orange City even though he missed half of his freshman season with an injury. Last season he ran for 1,418 yards and 22 touchdowns on 130 carries, an average of an impressive 11 yards per carry. His yardage is even more impressive when considering that he shared a lot of the load with two other running backs Marquis Mickens and L.J. Coleman, both seniors. \nNow Lingard can focus on his senior season and helping the Titans get to the state playoffs for the first time in school history. They finished 8-2 in each of the past three seasons, but still could not advance out of district play. University High opened in 2010. \nThere will still be suitors calling, but he said he’s done. \n“I’m really going to close my recruiting down,” Lingard said. “Any questions or stuff like that [other coaches] might have for me, I’m just going to have them talk to my uncle or my dad. Right now I have to focus on all my classes and track and stuff like that. I just need to keep a level head and focus on what I need to be doing.” \nTrack is another sport in which Lingard shines and he is one of the top hurdlers in the country. He was the Class 4A state champion in the 110-meter hurdles last year and his time of 13.94 seconds ranked as No. 4 overall in the state. \nHe said being able to continue his track career at Miami was another reason he chose the Hurricanes. \n“That was one of the great things about them,” Lingard said. “Most colleges say guys can run track and play football, but it’s another thing to hear it from the head [football] coach and the track department too.” \n\nCaption Grading state schools on National Signing Day \nFSU came out on top while UCF turned in a solid effort.
