Music from Young Dolph, Joe Young, LMFAO’s 8ky, Flip Major and Quavo, Eric Biddines and Siya also makes the cut. fat joe –“The lord sear special” \nRecent Roc Nation signee and D.I.T.C. vet Fat Joe sat down with Lord Sear for his Shade 45 show, The Lord Sear Special , where the longtime friends discussed Joe’s sneaker store UP NYC , almost getting his own sneaker with Jordan and extending an invitation to work with Tony Sunshine again. The camaraderie between the two is evident as their history goes back 25 years to the infamous Stretch & Bobbito radio show. Watch it above. Paul White & Danny Brown –“Accelerator EP” \nAfter dropping the crazy video for the title track, United Kingdom-based producer Paul White and Detroit’s Danny Brown have returned with the full Accelerator EP, a quick four-track project comprised of two songs and two remixes. The EP comes after Brown’s critically acclaimed album, Atrocity Exhibition , and is further evidence of their undeniable chemistry. White has worked on Brown’s last three projects. chief keef f. tadoe& ballout –“reload” \nChief Keef has recruited fellow Chicago spitters Tadoe and Ballout for his new “Reload” video, which is directed by Colourful Mula. He’s out on $500,000 bail after being accused of a violent home invasion by producer Ramsay Tha Great (who’s got his own legal issues now ), but for now, he’s back to what matters — making music. Kodak Black –“Everything 1k” \nApparently, the 13-year-old girl in Kodak Black’ s new video didn’t get paid a dime for starring in it despite being filmed with handfuls of money during the shoot. Danielle Bregoli (A.K.A. the brolic teenager responsible for the “Cash Me Ousside” mega-meme) lip syncs from the top of a Rolls as she counts stacks of hundred dollar bills and flosses her gold grill. Young Dolph –“Baller Alert” \nThe self-proclaimed King of Memphis, Young Dolph, keeps pumping out the tracks and rolls through with his latest video for “Baller Alert.” The song comes from his Gelato project, which features the controversial Yo Gotti diss track, “Play Wit Yo Bitch.” Released on February 2, the album also includes verses from Migos, Lil Yachty, and Wiz Khalifa, as well as production from Zaytoven, Nard and B. Joe Young –“Invincible Armour (Intro)” Wu-Tang Clan affiliate Joe Young returns with that authentic East Coast-flavored Hip Hop in the video for “Invincible Armour (Intro).” The song serves as the title track for the Invincible Armour LP featuring Wu-Tang Clan and production from Dame Grease ( DMX, Cam’ron, French Montana, Max B). 8ky f. Lama –“Underdog” Flip Major f. Quavo –“Take A Look” eric biddines –“Rushing Forever” SIYA f.
