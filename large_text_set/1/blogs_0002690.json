For what it’s worth, iOS 10 officially debuted to the world on September 13, 2016, so it’s been just over three months since Apple’s latest mobile operating system was published. \nThe pie chart also includes iOS 9 and earlier versions of the mobile platform. iOS 9, as it stands, is at 18% of active devices, while earlier iterations stand at 6%. Apple has said in the past that iOS 10 has seen the fastest adoption rate of any of its releases to date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:11:55.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
