Roger Goodell acknowledged that there are too many breaks in the action, and the replay process can be streamlined, hoping that the forthcoming adjustments can provide more bang for viewers’ buck. \nHis proposed changes were great, but Raiders coach Jack Del Rio had an even better suggestion: less flags. That’s something fans would love to see, knowing how frustrating it is to have the game come to a halt for constant laundry on the field. “For them to try to move along the game, I’m all for it,” Del Rio said on NFL Network, via ProFootballTalk . “I have one suggestion: Just don’t throw so many flags. We saw so many flags last year in Oakland, I’d like to see a lot less flags thrown. So hopefully we get that flow of the game issue.” \nThe Raiders led the league in penalties last season, so Del Rio is all too familiar with constant breaks in the action for infractions. Players would love to see less flags, as would coaches and viewers of the games. \nObviously, that’s easier said than done, and it does require some cooperation from the players. They’re the ones committing the penalties, regardless of whether they’re warranted or not. \nIf the NFL can cut down on penalties, Del Rio says, millennial fans will pay better attention to the games. “With the millennials and people nowadays, you’re not going to keep their attention if you have too many pauses and delays,” Del Rio said. “They want things right now. So for us to speed up the game, I think that’s smart.” \nThe NFL is already considering giving players more leeway when it comes to celebrations, but seeing fewer holding penalties and minor infractions would be welcomed, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:13:15.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
