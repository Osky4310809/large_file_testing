Pearson led Leicester to Premier League safety in 2015, putting together a remarkable run which saw them win seven of their final nine games. \nHe was fired in the summer of 2015 after a breakdown in his relationship with club chiefs. \nAlthough he is not top of the shortlist, the players, who complained to the club’s owner about Ranieri, would be open to his return to the King Power. Pearson kept Leicester up in 2015 (Photo: Plumb Images) Read More Leicester chief Srivaddhanaprabha explains why he sacked Ranieri \nOne manager who is high on Leicester’s list is Roberto Mancini, who briefly played for the Foxes in 2001. \nMancini had been harbouring hopes of landing a job back in England, but has now been linked with replacing Vincenzo Montella at AC Milan. \nThe Italians are seventh in Serie A and Montella is set to pay the price for a poor season. The club’s new Chinese investors believe Mancini can bring back the glory days. Mancini spent a month at Leicester as a player (Photo: PA) \nMancini joined Leicester on loan at the end of his playing career, but was so unhappy in the city that he returned to Italy after a month. \nAnd the ruthless way Leicester’s Thai owners have treated his friend Ranieri has also raised doubts.
