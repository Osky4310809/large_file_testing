She laughed off the hacking scandal during her routine, explaining that although it was hard to explain to her relatives, she’d been trying to send out pics of herself in her birthday suit.\n“You really just helped a sister out. Thank you for the distribution,” she said.\nCurrently single, the “Ghostbusters” actress also blames the president on the lack of love in her life.\n“I want to be in love,” she said. “I want to do that, but it’s 2017, and we got a pig in office.
