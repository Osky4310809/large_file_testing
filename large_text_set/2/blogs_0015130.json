We have a very good mix of youth and experience in the team and feel we need a young mind and a young captain with different ideas to spearhead Rising Pune Supergiants.” \nThe Supergiants only won five of their games last season despite boasting a squad featuring Dhoni, Smith, Faf du Plessis and Indian stars Ravichandran Ashwin and Ajinkya Rahane. \nGoenka confirmed to the Press Trust of India that Dhoni had been asked to step aside. \n“Dhoni has not stepped down. We have appointed Steve Smith as the skipper for the upcoming season. Frankly speaking, we did not have a good last season and we wanted someone young to lead the side and revamp it ahead of the upcoming season 10,” Goenka told PTI. \n“I have the highest regard for MS Dhoni as a leader and a person. Dhoni continues to be an integral member of our team. He is supportive of the decision keeping the franchise’s best interests in mind.” \nMore to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T11:58:28.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
