In this video from PremiumBeat , editor Jason Boone gives you 5 tips for customizing Premiere Pro to not only make it more efficient and easy to work with, but to also make it more conducive to the way you work. \nHere are the 5 tips Boone talks about in the video: Custom Bins \nOrganizing your media is a key part of having a good workflow. If you're spending most of your time looking for clips, music, and sound effects, you might want to start creating and organizing custom bins in Premiere Pro . Boone suggests making bins for video, audio, graphics, and sequences, as well as sub-folders within them for more specific assets, but you can customize it to fit your needs. \nFor instance, I just finished editing a short documentary piece last week and my bins, though they were organized in a similar way, contained sub-folders that related specifically to my project—e.g., the sub-folders in my graphics bin were arranged by year. Customize Source and Program Monitors \nThe buttons at the bottom of the Source and Program Panels are, for most editors, unnecessary because their corresponding keyboard shortcuts are so easy to remember. (The one for \"Play\" is the space bar, for example.) However, you can use the Button Editor to customize which buttons appear, perhaps ones with more complicated shortcuts, or you can get rid of them all together. Save Track Height Preset \nYou can create a track heigh present in the Timeline Display Settings menu to save yourself from having to resize tracks in your timeline, which is one of those time eaters that often goes under the radar. Save Custom Workspace \nHaving a workspace that works for you is another important element of efficient editing, and though Premiere Pro has a ton of presets, you might want to create your own that specifically serves your needs and tastes. You could even create different workspaces for the different kinds of projects you work on. To do this, organize your workspace until you have the layout you want, then go to the \"Workspaces\" option and save it as a new workspace. (Windows > Workspaces > Save as New Workspace) Use Project as a Template \nNow, once you've got everything the way you want it—your bins are all organized, you've customized your track height and workspace, you can save your project as a template for later use. This is especially helpful if you work with a lot of different kinds of projects, like documentaries, narrative films, music videos, multi-cam work, or commercials. \nWhat are some other ways you can customize Premiere Pro to make your workflow more efficient?
