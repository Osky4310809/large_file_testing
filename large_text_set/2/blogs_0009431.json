And I saw his arm start to go, like he was going to take a swing at me and I put my arm out to put it on his arm and stop him.” \nHe also explained his reason for supporting Trump from the beginning. \n“I always thought for the Republicans, uh, for conservatives to win another election, the only way they were going to do it was with somebody who fought back and fought back hard,” Baio told the host. \nAfter watching Trump’s performance during the first presidential debate Baio said he decided, “This is my guy. This guy is no holds barred and he’s going to go after everybody that goes after him.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
