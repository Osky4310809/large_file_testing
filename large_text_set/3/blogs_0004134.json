Beijing has already begun reducing coal imports from North Korea.\nA source told the Journal that after President Trump’s two-day summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month, US officials stated that all options were on the table when it came to dealing with North Korea’s nuclear-arms program.\nJapan and South Korea have been actively trying to aid the US in providing economic and diplomatic pressure against North Korea, the Journal reports.\nOn Wednesday, leaders from Seoul and the U.S. launched their annual, large-scale military exercises — prompting Jong Un to order his troops to prepare for a “merciless strike,” the Agence France-Presse reports.\nSEE ALSO \nTrump vows to 'very strongly' respond to North Korea 0:0 President Trump vowed to deal with North Korea “very strongly”... The drills were said to be similar to last year’s, when an estimated 300,000 South Korean troops were deployed alongside 17,000 US soldiers.\nOn Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis reportedly told South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-Koo that “any attack on the United States or its allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons will be met with a response that is effective and overwhelming.”\nThe US has been installing an advanced missile defense program — known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system — in South Korea as their neighbors to the north continue their atomic tests and launches.\nChinese and Russian officials said Wednesday that they would be doing everything they could to stop the “Thaad” program. The countries believe the powerful radar system can penetrate their borders and be used against them.\n“Both sides said they will continue to strengthen their coordinated opposition to Thaad,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website.\nWith Post Wires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:43:03.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
