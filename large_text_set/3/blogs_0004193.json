With tons of care and consideration, and a whole lot of nods to the original. The more and more we s ee of Beauty and the Beast , it’s clear that this movie is its own movie, but it’s still going to pay homage to the original.\nAnd there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.\nWhile the clips we’ve been treated to in the past have both been songs — with Belle singing “Belle,” and LeFou singing “Gaston” — the latest snipped from Disney actually shows us a scene from the movie. Specifically, the scene where The Beast is trying to coax Belle out of her bedroom for dinner.\nSpoiler alert: It didn’t work in 1991, and it’s not going to work in 2017, either. \nThis new clip also highlights exactly how the new movie is different, while still paying tribute to where the magical all began. Not to go all Beauty and the Beast historian on you (lol, at this point I might as well have majored in Beauty and the Beast ) but this scene actually pulls from a few different ones from the original movie.\nIn this new clip, Lumière, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Plumette all try to help the Beast be a little bit gentler, and ask him to flash his winning smile. The 1991 version has this same conversation, but it’s just Mrs. Potts and Lumière.\nDisney Disney Mrs. Potts also says the line, “The girl has lost her father and her freedom all in one day.” This is a direct line from the original — just in a brand new scene now.\nDisney Disney That’s how the movies are alike (with a ~twist~). And their differences?\nWell, for starters Belle is trying to CLIMB OUT THE WINDOW. Disney That’s one way to tell the Beast you’re just not that into him.\nOnly 16 more days till we can see the full movie with our own eyes, and endlessly compare it to the original.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:37:42.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
