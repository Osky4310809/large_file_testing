All of the books made the New York Times bestseller list. Keaton portrays Cold War veteran Stan Hurley, who trains CIA black-ops recruit Mitch Rapp, played by Dylan O’Brien of “The Maze Runner” fame. The pair are dispatched on a mission to stop an operative from starting World War III in the Middle East. Flynn, who grew up in St. Paul and graduated from St. Thomas Academy and the University of St. Thomas, died in 2013 after a 2½-year battle with prostate cancer. He was 47.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:41:37.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
