What, could a woman not have led this chanting? Are men entitled to special megaphone access? Why outsource this leadership to a man, even if he's an \"ally\"? These questions demand answers and accountability, especially since they were yelling about abortion -- a \"women's rights\" issue according to liberals, who ignore American women's strong support for various pro-life reforms. In any case, wow, sexist: \"When abortion rights are under attack, what do we do?\" Mitchum yelled through his megaphone to the crowd. \"Act up, fight back!\" the crowd yelled in response. \"When trans lives are under attack, what do we do?\" Mitchum yelled. \"Act up, fight back!\" the crowd yelled. Mitchum then yelled to the crowd, \"When women's lives are under attack, what do we do?\" \"Act up, fight back!\" the crowd yelled again.
