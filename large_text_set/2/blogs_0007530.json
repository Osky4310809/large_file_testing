The hosts took the lead early in the first half, as Pereira struck with precision from range with a volley from the top echelon. Aitor Alcalde Colomer/Getty Images The United youngster has impressed for Granada despite their relegation battle, and he continues to develop into a rounded attacking talent. Tana wasted a good opportunity minutes after the opener, with Las Palmas threatening to bag a quick equaliser. Pedro Bigas also missed the target from long range as his direct free-kick sailed wide, and the failures were indicative of Los Amarillos' accuracy in and around the box. Pereira found his name in the referee's book before the half-time whistle for a rash challenge, but the hosts were comfortable at the interval. Aitor Alcalde Colomer/Getty Images Aly Malle almost doubled Granada's lead five minutes into the second half, but the player watched his effort miss by inches. The Malian winger continued to be his side's most threatening outlet, but both teams struggled to create clear opportunities. Jese Rodriguez entered the fray for Las Palmas from the bench as they hunted for a goal, and the former Real Madrid attacker failed to convert in the final 10 minutes of the game when presented with a great chance. Spanish football journalist David Cartlidge noted the goalscorer at the end of the game for his overall contribution: David Cartlidge @davidjaca Goal aside, Pereira with another hard working, disciplined performance for Granada. Great work ethic throughout in box-to-box role. #MUFC 2/6/2017, 9:48:04 PM Granada scooped a much-needed victory for their club and collected only their second win of the La Liga campaign. Jese had a great opportunity to share the spoils late in the game, but Las Palmas didn't do enough to deny the hosts their brief moment in the sun.
