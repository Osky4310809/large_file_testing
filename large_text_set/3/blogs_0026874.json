As one of the first steps in this journey, our customers are upgrading to the Current Branch of ConfigMgr, and by doing so, they are starting to gain some benefits such as lower costs, simplified management, and better experience for both users and IT Pros. Take a look at how Australian Government Department of Human Services went through this journey. \nThis transformation is also supported by data that we see through our telemetry. There are now more than 31,000 organizations managing almost 70 million devices with the Current Branch of Configuration Manager. We expect this trend to continue in the coming months as more customers start realize the benefits of improved productivity and security as well as lower costs that come with staying current with Windows 10, Office 365, and Configuration Manager. \nThanks to our active Technical Preview Branch community, the 1702 update includes feedback and usage data we have gathered from customers who have installed and road tested our monthly technical previews over the last few months. As always, 1702 has also been tested at scale — by real customers, in real production environments. As of today, nearly 1 million devices are being managed by the version 1702 of Configuration Manager. \n1702 update includes many new features and enhancements in Windows 10 management and also new functionality for customers using Configuration Manager connected with Microsoft Intune . Here are just few of the enhancements that are available in this update: Support for Windows 10 Creators Update – This version of Configuration Manager now supports the release of upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update . You can upgrade Windows 10 ADK to the latest version for full OS imaging support. Express files support for Windows 10 Cumulative Update – Configuration Manager now supports Windows 10 Cumulative Update using Express files. Customize high-risk deployment warning – You can now customize the Software Center warning when running a high-risk deployment, such as a task sequence to install a new operating system. Close executable files at the deadline when they would block application installation – If executable files are listed on the Install Behavior tab for a deployment type and the application is deployed to a collection as required, then a more intrusive notification experience is provided to inform the user, and the specified executable files will be closed automatically at the deadline. This is currently the feature with the second highest number of votes on UserVoice . Conditional access for PCs managed by System Center Configuration Manager – Now production ready in update 1702, with conditional access for PCs managed by Configuration Manager, you can restrict access to various applications (including but not limited to Exchange Online and SharePoint online) to PCs that are compliant with the compliance policies you set. \nThis release also includes new features for customers using Configuration Manager connected with Microsoft Intune. Some of the new feature include: Android for Work support – You can now enroll devices, approve and deploy apps, and configure policies for devices with Android for Work. Lookout threat details – You can view threat details as reported by Lookout on a device. Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP) enhancements – You can now request a policy sync on an enrolled mobile device from the Configuration Manager console.
