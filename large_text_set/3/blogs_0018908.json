Associated Press | Published: 21.03.17 , 19:02 \nDuring the next war, Islamic militants in Gaza or Lebanon who decide to go to war with Israel could find their usual targets empty. This due to the fact that Israel is drawing up contingency plans to evacuate up to a quarter-million civilians from border communities to protect them from attacks executed by Hamas, Hezbollah or other Islamic militant groups. \nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter \n\nThe mass evacuations would be the biggest in Israel's history, part of a bigger plan where the army works with municipalities to keep civilians safe. \n\nAll sides have been preparing in case a new round of warfare breaks out, although Hezbollah—an Iranian-backed group sworn to Israel's destruction—is currently tied down in Syria's civil war fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad. \n\nEach side has warned that a new conflict would be worse than previous ones. Hezbollah fired more than 4,000 rockets on Israeli communities in the 2006 war , while Israel bombarded militant targets in southern Lebanon. The month of fighting killed an estimated 1,300 Lebanese, 44 Israeli civilians and 121 Israeli soldiers. \nAmerican servicemen and Israeli soldiers participate in a joint drill simulating a rocket attack at a base in Hatzor (Photo: AP, file photo) \n\nIn 2014, 50 days of fighting between Israel and Gaza's Islamic militant Hamas rulers killed an estimated 2,100 Palestinians, six Israeli civilians and 66 Israeli soldiers. There was widespread devastation in Gaza and thousands of rockets and mortars fired by Hamas and other Islamic militants at Israeli towns and cities. \n\nIsrael has stated that Hezbollah and Hamas have rebuilt larger arsenals capable of hitting the entire country. Elements of the evacuation plan, codenamed \"Safe Distance,\" were disclosed by a senior Israeli officer in an interview to The Associated Press. \n\n\"In 2017, all of Israel is under threat,\" said Col. Itzik Bar of the military's Homefront Command. Preparations are underway for Israel to deal with \"very high amounts\" of incoming fire , he said. \n\nBar pointed out that Hezbollah has gained battle experience from fighting alongside Assad's forces and that Hassan Nasrallah, the Shiite group's chief, has recently increased his rhetoric about attacking Israel. \n\nThe idea is to \"remove the threat by not having civilians there,\" Bar said. \"We want a meeting of army and Hezbollah forces and not civilians with Hezbollah forces.\" \n\nThe evacuation plan would apply mainly to communities adjacent to the borders, he said. \n\n\"In places where we understand there is a great danger to civilians, for example, where we won't be able to supply defenses or supply deterrence ... we will evacuate,\" Bar said. \n\nEvacuees would be housed in existing infrastructure, including hotels, schools and Kibbutz guest houses, he said. \n\nThe scope of evacuations would depend on the situation, but all told, the plans cover up to 250,000 people who would be moved to safety if there is a conflict on multiple fronts, he said. Israel has a population of about 8.5 million. \n\nSmall core groups would stay behind in evacuated areas to maintain vital infrastructure and ensure that communities \"function the day after the fighting,\" he said. \n\nAnother senior security official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with protocol, said the idea resulted from lessons learned in the 2014 Gaza war, in which communities were not evacuated but residents eventually left on their own. \n\nTens of thousands of Israelis left their homes near the Gaza border as the fighting dragged on, turning some areas into ghost towns. The exodus was sparked by Palestinian shelling along with the fear of heavily armed Gaza militants infiltrating Israel through tunnels. \n\nBorder communities vulnerable to mortars are the most in danger, he said. \n\nIsrael's \" Iron Dome \" defense system was seen as a game-changer in the 2014 war, ensuring a decisive protective edge from short-range rockets fired from Gaza. But the security official said there were not enough of the defensive systems to cover attacks on multiple fronts. \n\nHe said Hezbollah has significantly built up its weapons stockpile since the 2006 war and has upgraded its arsenal to about 150,000 missiles. \n\nIsrael has made it clear it will act to prevent Hezbollah getting advanced munitions and is widely believed to have carried out several airstrikes in recent years on weapons convoys making their way to the militant group . On Friday, Israel made a rare admission of such a strike after Syria fired missiles at its jets. \n\nHowever, the official said Israel fears that some advanced weapons like surface-to-sea weapons or anti-aircraft missiles might already have reached Hezbollah. \n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has been building up its missile defenses. A system called David's Sling to intercept medium-range missiles from Hezbollah is due to become operational in early April. That would mark the completion of a multilayer missile defense system that includes Iron Dome and Arrow, designed to intercept long-range ballistic missiles—of the type possessed by Iran—high in the stratosphere. \n\nThe military also has vastly improved its early warning systems, according to Bar, the Israeli colonel. \n\nTechnology has come a long way since 1991 when air raid sirens sent Israelis nationwide scurrying to bomb shelters when Iraq fired Scud missiles at Tel Aviv. In the 2014 Gaza war, sirens warned of incoming rocket attacks on wide areas. \n\nBar said the system has been narrowed down and improved \"dramatically\" with more than 3,000 different warning zones. Now only civilians in the line of fire will need to take shelter, while others in the same city won't, he said. \n\nAn annual intelligence assessment found Hezbollah or Hamas probably are not interested in sparking a war in 2017, but it warned of the danger of a dynamic of escalation leading to conflict. In February, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah was not seeking a resumption of hostilities. But he vowed that if war did begin, his forces would strike Israel's Dimona nuclear facilities. \n\nSeveral Hamas officials say the group does not seek a confrontation with Israel now, but that it has developed its arsenal and restored its capabilities to even greater amount than before the 2014 war. They did not specify numbers. \n\nReports in Gaza suggest Hamas completed repairs to dozens of attack tunnels used to infiltrate Israel that were damaged in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:48:31.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
