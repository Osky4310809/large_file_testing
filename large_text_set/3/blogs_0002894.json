WA election: polling in key seats gives Labor hope, despite bigger picture Read more \nThe managing director of Galaxy, David Briggs, said Labor’s primary vote was at 40% and it would have to rely on preferences from the 24% of voters who support the minor parties. \nHe said Labor would likely achieve the usual strong preference flow from Green voters but he said they could also pick up pick close to 50% of preferences from One Nation supporters. \nIf the predicted 11% swing is uniform, Labor could pick up Perth, Forrestfield, Belmont, Swan Hills, Morley, Balcatta, Mount Lawley, Bicton, Kalamunda, Joondalup, Southern River and Wanneroo. \nLabor would also win the notionally Liberal-held seats of Collie-Preston and West Swan. \nBarnett told the Weekend Australian on Saturday that he was still confident of winning a third term, although he expected to lose “some seats”. \n“People are predicting massive swings but on the day I’m optimistic the swing won’t be that great and for Labor to win 10 seats, that’s quite difficult,” he said. “I’m optimistic we can hang on.” Malcolm Turnbull says WA deal doesn't mean Liberal party supports One Nation Read more \nThe campaign enters its final week on Sunday. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson , is expected in WA for the final week. \nFormer Labor prime minister Bob Hawke campaigned with McGowan on Saturday, while the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, attended a Liberal rally with Barnett. \nHanson took heart from the Galaxy poll that shows One Nation on 9%. \n“I do believe we will win seats in the upper house, especially the Libs are preferencing us before the Nats and Labor,” she told ABC TV on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:09:23.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
