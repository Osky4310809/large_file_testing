Normally fifteen-minute rides were taking an hour or more. The massive traffic is a result of the 1,023 that were cancelled during yesterdayâ€™s storm, ongoing construction at the airport and weekend air travel. \nMany people were spotted getting out of cabs, jumping the concrete barrier and making their way through the slush and icy roads all the way to the terminals on foot.
