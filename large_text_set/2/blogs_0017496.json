In a social situation we consciously, or unconcsciously, size up others around us. When I see a woman in a perfectly tailored business suit, and well coifed hair, texting on her blackberry I assume she is a high powered executive. When I see a man walking barefoot in well worn board shorts, shirtless, with a tan and wearing a shell necklace I think to myself that he must know how to catch a wave. When I see a mother wearing her baby in a carrier, especially a woven wrap, I tend to assume this mother practices attachment parenting techniques. \ncontinue reading below our video How to Make a Room Feel Bigger \nDo all \"crunchy\" moms use cloth diapers? Surprisingly, no they don't. Are all moms that use cloth diapers also \"crunchy\" and into a green, eco-friendly lifestyle, breastfeed their babies until they are 6, and \"mouth feed\" them? Not even close. \nHuman beings are programmed to assess the people around them. Some do so more than others, some are better at it than others. If anyone comments that they don't make any assumptions whatsoever about another person based on appearance, clothing choice, the car they drive, or the food they eat I wouldn't believe them. \nThat being said I do get annoyed at the assumption that all cloth diapering mothers are crunchy! I struggle with the term myself. \nI'll explain myself briefly: I breastfeed \"full-term\" (also called extended breastfeeding) I bedshare I practice \"Elimination Communication\" on a part time basis I recycle I use \" Gentle Discipline \" but I'm certainly not perfect with it I wear my babies in carriers I don't use paper towels and instead use cloth \"unpaper\" towels \nOn the flip side... I eat meat. Lots of it. And usually it isn't organic. A lot of times it might even be fried I don't compost or have any clue how to I can't garden or grow my own food I wear leather and love it I have a lifestyle of indulgence in some areas, such as technology, that is not sustainable \nWhen I look at myself from afar I don't feel very crunchy. If there is a \"look\" then I don't look crunchy either. However I will say that cloth diapering has opened my eyes to a very crunchy world that I get more and more into with each passing day. Many of the things that I practice in parenting were things I learned about thanks to starting my journey into cloth diapering. \nWe all cloth diaper for different reasons. We need to save money, we feel the need to waste less, we want fewer chemicals on our baby, we think they are cute. I do it for all of these reasons but some people ONLY do it to save money but don't live a green or \"crunchy\" life at all. And that is OK. \nThings aren't always what they appear to be. If you identify as \"crunchy\" or \"granola\" that is awesome. And if you don't that is cool too. Me? Well, I don't even know. I'm definitely NOT soggy but I'm not too hard on the teeth either. Maybe I'm just crunchy enough, like cereal that has been in milk for a few seconds. I can totally live with that.
