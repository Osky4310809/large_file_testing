That includes 19,000 people with health insurance through the individual marketplace and 60,000 people insured through the small business marketplace. The District’s population is 681,000 and it has one of the lowest rates of uninsured people in the country. \nThe Democratic mayor says many of the insured people have complex medical problems and couldn’t afford premiums without federal subsidies. \nShe’s urging Congress not to repeal the law and instead to expand access to affordable health coverage. \nFollow CBS D.C. on Twitter \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
