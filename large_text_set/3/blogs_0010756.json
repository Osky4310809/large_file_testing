According to Daily DDT ‘s latest round of WWE rumors, Reigns is predicted to win the whole shooting match over at WrestleMania . The outlet believes, then, that this will be Reigns’ crowning moment . \n“Even though the streak is no more, Taker has not lost any other matches at the annual extravaganza. Be as it may, the Phenom could be in line for his second defeat at the showcase of the immortals. Roman Reigns is simply booked that strongly at times. Undertaker is a legend in the business. That being said, against Roman Reigns, WWE might just choose to break the tradition once again.” \nTo fall Taker, then, would establish Reigns in wrestling history forever. But what comes after wrestling’s biggest night? \nViva the mother of Roman @WWERomanReigns pic.twitter.com/mF3Q298DfF \n—✨Cristina ♫ Cruz (@cruzcris45) March 12, 2017 \nAccording to Cultured Vulture ‘s latest round of WWE rumors, the best thing that can happen to Roman Reigns is that a heel turn is booked, no matter what happens during WrestleMania . \n“While the fans are booing him anyway, WWE should at least make it seem like it’s on purpose. Not only do you turn him heel, you make him the absolute top heel in the company. A bad guy so hateable that you can launch a myriad of new babyface stars just by having them go up against him. But to launch a top heel, you need a great heel turn, and with Reigns looking almost certain to face The Undertaker at Wrestlemania, the opportunity is there for perhaps the greatest heel turn since Hogan.” \nTo succeed at this, said the outlet, there has to be a “babyface” build-up, which they feel is happening right now. \nWhat do you think of this latest round of WWE rumors?
