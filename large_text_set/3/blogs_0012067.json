Australia's budget deficit hit by weaker wage and profit growth, Myefo reveals Read more \nThe BCA chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, warned that “stubborn opposition to savings measures and the absence of an agreed strategy to tackle the budget problem are foisting a growing debt burden on young Australians and our future generations”. \n“Australian households will bear the costs of inaction through blunt cuts in services, higher taxes and a weaker, less resilient economy.” \nThe fate of the Turnbull government’s $4bn omnibus savings bill is still unclear, after Nick Xenophon warned in February that the welfare cuts in the bill came at “too high a cost”. \nThe bill involves a range of cuts to paid parental leave, scrapping the energy supplement for new recipients, requiring jobseekers under 25 to wait four weeks before accessing income support and cutting the pension to migrant pensioners who spend more than six weeks overseas. \nThe BCA submission notes that $50bn in budget cuts amounts to the equivalent of one-third of the current social security budget, or almost the entire education and defence budgets combined. \n“Neither of these options – higher taxation or savage budget cuts – is acceptable but they are inevitable if we fail to act now,” Westacott said. The deficit “wasn’t created by lower revenues” and therefore “new taxes are not the solution”, she said. \n“Nor are higher tax rates, as they would do nothing to improve services or increase value for money. We cannot afford to think that as our spending grows, we should simply tax more.” Childcare and savings bill in jeopardy as Nick Xenophon vows to vote against it Read more \nTurnbull said the BCA was “encouraging the Senate to pass our budget measures”, which were still being negotiated. \n“If we don’t rein in the deficit ... the inevitable consequence is that we will, and particularly our children will have lesser services or higher taxes.” \nAsked whether the budget would contain further cuts, Turnbull said the government had already set out a plan to reach budget surplus by 2020-21 but its plans were still subject to negotiation. \n“While we often talk about the crossbench, let’s focus on the responsibility of the Labor party ... the obligation on [Bill] Shorten is to take up the responsibility and help us bring the budget back into balance.” \nIn its budget submission, released in February, the Australian Council of Social Services called on the government to save $9.4bn in 2018-19 with measures including winding back negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts, and abolishing private health subsidies. \nIt also called for a range of new revenue measures, including applying the Medicare levy surcharge to all high-income earners and imposing a sugar tax on sweetened drinks.
