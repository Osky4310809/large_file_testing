Mariah Carey botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nStella Bulochnikov, the pop star’s manager, explained everything to Us Weekly on January 1: \nI will never know the truth, but I do know that we told them three times that her mic pack was not working and it was a disastrous production. I’m certainly not calling the FBI to investigate. It is what it is: New Year’s Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. \nOH, SNAP! Those are fighting words. \nBulochnikov stood by her girl and continued to throw some accusatory shade, adding, \nThey acknowledged that they knew her inner ears were not working. They did not cut to a commercial. They did not cut to the West Coast feed, they left her out there to get ratings. \nMariah was seemingly less affected by the performance. She took to Twitter to wish everyone a happy new year… and let them know that this crap happens sometimes. Shit happens Have a happy and healthy new year everybody!

Mariah’s got bigger fish to fry. \nDick Clark productions also released a statement about the incident: \nTo suggest that DCP, as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year’s Rockin’ Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. \nIn very rare instances there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television, however, an initial investigation has indicated that DCP had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey’s New Year’s Eve performance. \nWe want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge her tremendous accomplishments in the industry. \nSooo … who do you believe? \nWe’re willing to bet Mariah’s next headline will leave her NYE performance in the past — for her sake. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T19:43:36.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
