Starting with the Honor 5X and Honor 8 and now the Honor 6X, the company has gone from strength to strength in a short time, courtesy of solid devices with impressive designs, specifications, and most importantly, aggressive price points. Given that it is a very new brand in the US market, Honor’s growth has been impressive, and the company is hoping to continue that momentum in 2017.\nIf you’ve seen our comprehensive review of the Honor 6X , you will know that we were particularly excited by the device’s design, fantastic dual camera setup, and large battery that allows for up to 2 days of battery life, and the best part is that you get all of this for a price of just $250. All of these factors together is the reason why the Honor 6X also received our “Best of CES 2017” award.\nOne of the major reasons for Honor’s success can be attributed to the attention the company pays to their consumers. Honor is one of the few OEMs that actively participate on various social media platforms, and make the time and effort to reply to user complaints and concerns. Consumer is king, and Honor does its best to provide the best product and service it can to keep their ever-growing consumer base as happy as possible.\n\nWhile Honor is relatively new in the US, the company has enjoyed a popular presence in their home market of China, and as always, some of their best devices are saved for it. This includes the wonderful Honor Magic, a concept smartphone that not only looks great with curved glass on the sides and up top at the front and back, but also features an AI based user interface that makes the software experience simple and intuitive.\nHonor has come a long way in a very short time, and if the company continues to push the boundaries of the smartphone world with devices like the Honor Magic and Honor 6X, we can only expect great things from Honor in 2017 and beyond.
