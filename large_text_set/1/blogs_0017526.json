It takes just 10 seconds for Chelsea to issue a statement of intent, as a long ball over the top from Luiz presents Costa with a chance on the volley, which he flashes fractions wide of the near post! 1' AND THEY'RE OFF! Chelsea get us underway, attacking right to left. The teams are out on the pitch at Stamford Bridge, with kick-off rapidly approaching! STAT: Costa has scored in all three of his previous Premier League appearances against Hull, assisting twice. Victory for Chelsea will send them nine points clear at the summit, with Tottenham, Manchester City, Liverpool and Manchester United all dropping points this weekend. Arsenal are the only side in the top six to have won this weekend, with Alexis Sanchez's late penalty giving them a 2-1 win over Burnley. Hull substitutes: Marshall, Meyler, Maloney, Diomande, Niasse, Tymon, Bowen. Hull (3-5-2): Jakupovic; Maguire, Dawson, Davies; Elabdellaoui, Mason, Huddlestone, Clucas, Roberston; Evandro, Hernandez. Chelsea substitutes: Begovic, Ake, Zouma, Chalobah, Fabregas, Willian, Batshuayi. Chelsea (3-4-3): Courtois; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Kante, Matic, Alonso; Pedro, Costa, Hazard. The big pre-match news, however, is that Diego Costa is back in the starting line-up for Chelsea. The striker was dropped for last weekend's 3-0 win over Leicester City amid reports of a bust-up with Antonio Conte and interest from the Chinese Super League. He returns to make his 100th appearance for the club today, and the full line-ups are coming now. The Tigers sit just one point off the bottom, but a shock-victory today, which would be a first for them against the Blues in the Premier League, could pull them ahead of Swansea and out of the bottom-three. Hull City got the win they so desperately craved last weekend against Bournemouth, just their second since the end of August, but theyâ€™re in tough to keep that momentum going today against a Chelsea side firing on all cylinders. Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester City and Manchester United all dropped points yesterday, meaning the Blues can go eight-points clear atop the table in what, at least on paper, appears a very winnable fixture for them. Chelsea were idle on Saturday but the stars aligned for Antonio Conte and company as results elsewhere have the runaway top-flight leaders poised to increase the gap at the Premier League summit. Hello and welcome to Stamford Bridge as Chelsea aim to widen their lead atop the Premier League table when they play host to relegation-threatened Hull City!
