It's everywhere. Men, women and non-gendered people alike have all glommed onto the style. It covers a lot of demographic ground. \nThough there are many variations, the high fade is generally characterized by clean lines, an attention to tight grooming, and is relatively quick and easy to achieve. When filmmakers in 50 years want to make a movie about 2015, they'll likely use the high fade as a synechdoche for the social media-addled hellscape of this God awful decade. As hipsterdom became mainstreamed in the early 2010s, the high fade became a popular go-to that was current while alluding heavily to the past. \nSeriously, if future generations were judging by photographs alone, they might think we were enjoying another swing revival at the moment. \nAll of this is to say that the high fade seems to have hit a saturation point. It's everywhere, particularly among urban, left-leaning twenty- and thirty-somethings. \nBut the high fade's appropriation by libertarians and blundering \"figureheads\" of the alt-right like Milo Yabbadapolous and Richard Spencer (aka the \"Dapper Nazi\" who will forever be known for getting cracked in the face ) signals an attempt by the alt-right to reclaim this haircut and tie it to its Nazi roots. Or better yet, it's a way for crypto-Nazis to feel like OG Nazis. So the question remains: Will the left turn on the high fade now that these morons are trying to hijack it? \nBambi Saunders — lead stylist and hair historian at Rudy's Barbershop — gave me the rundown on where the haircut comes from, how it got so hot in recent times and if the alt-right can kill it. \nThe high fade \"started out more like a military haircut,\" Saunders explains. \"A marine would get 'the high and tight.' There are many variations like the high fade or the thin fade. I know when my dad was in bootcamp, they would shave everyone's head and that's how they knew that you were in bootcamp, because you'd have a bald head. And when you were not in boot camp, when you're an officer, you still had to keep your hair coiffed pretty short. But you could have a little something growing on the top so that’s where the high and tight came in.\" The military high and tight", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:25:59.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
