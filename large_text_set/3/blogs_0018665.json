Add 30 points to any @realDonaldTrump 's poll. Polls showed Hillary 98.1% likely to win election, morning of Nov 8. https://t.co/AL6YIPtUz9 https://t.co/0ErjmCF77r \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 21, 2017 \nHowever, she then went on to sound the alarm on the latest polls, calling them “significant” as it seems to show Trump is moving away from being himself. OTOH, Trump numbers dropping is significant. Trump got elected for wall, deportations & trade. Instead he's doing tax cuts & Obamacare Lite. https://t.co/0ErjmCF77r \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 21, 2017 \nBesides bringing up the healthcare fight, Coulter also seemed to lob some criticism at Trump for filling his administration with former Goldman Sachs employees. The beauty of Trump was he didn't need donors. He got 1% of Goldman Sachs' vote. HE DOESN'T OWE THEM ANYTHING. Let's do immigration & trade! https://t.co/0ErjmCF77r \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 21, 2017 \nWhile Coulter is generally a Trump defender, she has been critical of him in the past, especially when she thinks he is shifting on certain issues and policies. In December, she was concerned that the “big sell out” was coming from Trump on immigration. Weeks before that, she took shots at him for his comments that he wouldn’t pursue charges against Hillary Clinton. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:40:59.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
