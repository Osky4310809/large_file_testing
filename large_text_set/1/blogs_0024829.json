We cannot corroborate its accuracy, but it is an amusing story...) \nWhen Gandhi was studying law at the University College of London, there was a professor, whose last name was Peters, who felt animosity for Gandhi, and because Gandhi never lowered his head towards him, their \"arguments\" were very common. \nOne day, Mr. Peters was having lunch at the dining room of the University and Gandhi came along with his tray and sat next to the professor. The professor, in his arrogance, said, \"Mr Gandhi: you do not understand... a pig and a bird do not sit together to eat,\" to which Gandhi replies, \"You do not worry professor, I'll fly away, \" and he went and sat at another table. \nMr. Peters, green of rage, decides to take revenge on the next test, but Gandhi responds brilliantly to all questions. Then, Mr. Peters asked him the following question, \"Mr Gandhi, if you are walking down the street and find a package, and within it there is a bag of wisdom and another bag with a lot of money; which one will you take?\" \nWithout hesitating, Gandhi responded, \"the one with the money, of course.\" \nMr. Peters, smiling, said, \"I, in your place, would have taken the wisdom, don't you think?\" \n\"Each one takes what one doesn't have,\" responded Gandhi indifferently. \nMr. Peters, already hysteric, writes on the exam sheet the word \"idiot\" and gives it to Gandhi. Gandhi takes the exam sheet and sits down. A few minutes later, Gandhi goes to the professor and says, \"Mr. Peters, you signed the sheet, but you did not give me the grade.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T03:47:33.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
