Or anyone you are associated with. They are dangerous on the roads as well. Goes with the territory I know but it makes living hard,” he said. \nThere’s little doubt the journalist is referring to the unwanted attention since he started seeing model and designer Jasmine Yarbrough. \nThe pair reportedly started dating late last year with photos of Karl lying on the deck of a luxury yacht alongside his beautiful blonde model girlfriend splashed across papers last month. media_camera Stefanovic and new girlfriend Jasmine Yarbrough leaving after their day on the luxury yacht. \nSources told Fairfax his family found out about the new relationship through the paparazzi photos. \n“At no point before it was released in the media did Karl tell [his wife] Cassandra or the children he was in a relationship and that he wanted his girlfriend to meet them,” the source said on February 21. \nStefanovic split from his wife Cassandra Thorburn back in October after 21 years of marriage, reportedly in part due to the toll The Today Show took on their family. media_camera Stefanovic and his wife Cassandra Thorburn back in 2011. \nFor his part, Karl has remained pretty tight-lipped about his private life since the split, but recently opened up to the Herald Sun about the toll it’s taken on his family. \n“For me personally I would definitely have failures in a husband sense and hope that I can rectify my failures as a dad,” Karl told the publication. \n“I hope I can try and rebuild whatever has happened in the past and try and make the most of what I can do with them in the future.” \nThe host also spoke about the pressures of the paparazzi on the children. \n“For me the only issue was the burden of paparazzi around my family in the initial months. That is regrettable, that is hard to explain to a kid and I think it is awful for kids,” he said. \nStefanovic and Thorburn have three kids together: Jackson, 16, Ava, 11, and River, 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T05:07:51.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
