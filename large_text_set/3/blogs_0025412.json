'Good friends' \nErdogan again denounced the cancellation of his ministers' trips to European countries with a large Turkish diaspora ahead of the referendum. \nOn Wednesday he warned that Europeans risk being unsafe on the world's streets, as the crisis between Ankara and the EU showed no signs of abating. RELATED: Erdogan says Olympic Committee playing 'tricks' on Turkey ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's president, who has angered European allies with charges of fascism and anti-Turkish skulduggery, took grievances to the sporting arena on Monday, accusing the International Olympic Committee of playing tricks to stop Istanbul hosting the event. Erdogan sees Turkey parliament restoring capital punishment Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday he expected parliament to approve restoring capital punishment after next month's referendum in a move that could end Ankara's bid to join the EU. \nThe same day Germany's new President Frank-Walter Steinmeier again urged the Turkish leader to \"stop these appalling comparisons with Nazism, do not cut the ties with those who want a partnership with Turkey.\" \nErdogan said he was \"good friends\" with Steinmeier and \"deplored\" his comments. \nHe added that there could be a \"period of review\" of Turkey relations with the European Union, while stressing the importance of economic ties with the bloc, his country's biggest trading partner. \nTurkey is officially an EU-candidate nation but its accession process has been practically blocked for years. \nHe said that an EU-Turkey agreement on migrants, aimed at reducing the numbers reaching Europe from Africa and the Middle East, would be part of an \"A to Z\" review of government policy to begin after the April 16 referendum. 'Saddened' \nTurning to the issue of Kurdish separatists in Turkey and Syria, the Erdogan said he was \"saddened\" by links which Russia and the US have with Kurdish militias. \nWhile he is a regular critic of Washington over its support for the Kurdish YPG militia operating in Syria it was the first time he had expressed his unhappiness with Moscow's stance \nTurkey summoned the Russian charge d'affaires on Wednesday and sent him another message Thursday to convey \"deep unease\" over two incidents in Kurdish militia-controlled Syria, Ankara said. \nAnkara said one of its soldiers had been shot and killed in southern Turkey on Wednesday by cross-border sniper fire from an area of northwestern Syria controlled by the Kurdish YPG militia. \nOn Thursday, the foreign ministry sent a new message to the Russian envoy over photos of Russian troops apparently showing them wearing YPG insignia, state-run news agency Anadolu said. \nThe YPG confirmed on Monday that they had received military training from Russian operatives, something Moscow has not confirmed.
