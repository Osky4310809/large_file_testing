Some of you people know me as Omega or Quintessence or a Nameless Ghoul or a fucking asshole for that matter. \n\"Since July of last year - 2016, that is - I'm no longer a part of Ghost, as some of you have noticed. The reasons why we'll take at another date, not today. \n\"I'd like to take this opportunity to say thank you so much to everyone that has supported us, and me, and having come to the shows and all the tours and everything. I'm very, very happy and humbled for having been able to do this. And I'd like to say a massive thanks to every one of you from the bottom of my heart. \n\"A long time ago, there was a band called MCC, Magna Carta Cartel. MCC went to sleep seven years ago as GHOST emerged. There really wasn't much time for MCC and hasn't been for a long, long time. Now things have changed and it's time that MCC wakes up and rises up again.\" \nApart from Persner, MCC featured Simon Söderberg, Arvid Persner, Pär Glendor, and Tobias Forge. \nIn related news, Magna Carta Cartel has released its first music in 8 years, a tune called \"Sway.\" You can check it out below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T11:43:19.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
