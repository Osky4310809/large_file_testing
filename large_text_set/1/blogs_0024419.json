Brian J Masterson worked tirelessly at the scene of the terrorist attack in New York. https://t.co/bZQ8kRfjQ3 \n— The Daily Record (@Daily_Record) January 28, 2017 \nIrish-born Brian Masterson, 61, who breathed the toxic air around the World Trade Center as he and other first responders tried to save those they could, died of esophageal cancer this week.   Authorities: Ft. Lauderdale Shooter Might Have Initially Planned To Attack NYC \nMore than 5,000 cases of cancer have been diagnosed among the first responders who rushed to Ground Zero and labored in its dust for days. That number will only grow. \nDr. Michael Crane, who operates the 9/11 Health Program Clinic at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, estimated that 10 to 15 new cancer patients who were first responders come to the center each week. We regret to announce 2 more WTC Deaths. FF Kevin Rooney E-42 & Ret. FF Brian Masterson Marine-9, L-45 #RIP Brothers. #9/11 \n— UFA (@UFANYC) January 24, 2017   \nMasterson’s death came soon after that of Kevin Rooney, another first responder who died of Ground Zero-linked cancer. \n“As a result of the 9-11 attacks on our nation, our New York City Firefighters have been getting sick and dying in high numbers due to cancers and other diseases caused by breathing the toxic air at the World Trade Center,” said Uniformed Firefighters Association President James Slevin . \n“The deaths of retired Firefighter Brian Masterson and Firefighter Kevin Rooney are unfortunate reminders that New York City Firefighters and other first responders continue to suffer from the aftermaths of 9/11,” he added. \nMasterson, a father of three, was diagnosed with cancer in 2015.   Jon Voight: Miley Cyrus And Shia LaBeouf Are ‘Teaching Treason’ \n“The number of firefighters and other first responders being diagnosed with cancer as a direct result of working so many days at the site of the Twin Towers has been constantly growing to this very day,” said his nephew, Christopher Ferry. “My uncle fought very hard for two years overcoming the odds, and died on Sunday night with his family by his side.” \n— Todd Maisel (@ToddMaisel) September 12, 2016 \nSome, like Sal Turturici , still fight even though they know the odds. \n“I want to be there for them. I want to walk my daughter down the aisle. I want to see my boys graduate college. I want to see this all happen. And I’m not sure I am going to get there,” he said this September as he battled stomach cancer only recently diagnosed. \n“They said that the cancer was in him for approximately seven years. And I – I can’t believe it,” his wife, Wendy, said. “Seven years it’s been in him. Not a pain.” \nWhen interviewed by CBS last year, his wife worried the nation would forget those who rallied in one of its darkest hours. \n“Don’t forget about us. Don’t forget about the families that are out there,” Wendy said. \n“And remember, you’ve got to remember,” Sal said. “Remember that this is what happened. This is the history, this is our legacy. They died and we’re dying, and hopefully that, you know, that you think about us and remember us and keep us in your prayers.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
