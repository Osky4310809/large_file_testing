PUBLISHED: 07:20, Mon, Jan 2, 2017 | UPDATED: 07:23, Mon, Jan 2, 2017 \nIf Theresa May ’s Government sticks to its promise the process of our withdrawal from the European Union should begin within just three months, once Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty has been triggered. \nAn exciting new chapter in our island story is about to be written. \nBut the embittered Remain campaigners will still do all in their power to prevent the return of our national sovereignty. Related articles GETTY Theresa May has said she wants to trigger Article 50 in March of this year \nTheir ruthless, undemocratic fight against Brexit is maintained in the courts, Parliament and the media. Despite the failure of their Project Fear they keep up their hysterically negative propaganda. In truth the decision actually lies between the restoration of our democratic independence or continued British subjugation to Brussels \nLast November, for example, they ridiculously claimed that the Brexit process is so complicated that it could take at least 10 years to complete. \nIt was pointed out to the Remoaners that we won two world wars in a shorter timescale than that. Just as misguided are their court cases and their threats to overturn Brexit legislation. \nBut by far their most insidious tactic is the attempt to manufacture a choice between two different types of withdrawal. GETTY ‘Soft Brexit should more honestly be called ‘Fake Brexit’’, says McKinstry \nPeddling their deceitful, twisted pro-EU narrative, they tell us that we can either have a “soft” Brexit, which would mean the continuation of an interwoven, dependent relationship with Brussels. \nOr we can go for a so-called “hard” Brexit, which would allegedly result in isolation. \nThe language is deliberate and cynical. “Soft” implies something comfortable, easy and untroubling, whereas “hard” indicates something difficult, painful and extreme. \nIn political terms, “hard” suggests extremism and division, which fits all the Remoaners’ hollow smears about the xenophobia of the Leave campaign. \nOn the economic front, the word signals a bleak future of national decline and penury. \nPredictably this phraseology has been taken up by those parts of the media that still act as a mouthpiece for the pro-EU establishment. \nAcross the airwaves, “hard” and “soft” Brexit are treated as if they were concrete realities. But the supposed choice between them is a false one. \nIn truth the decision actually lies between the restoration of our democratic independence or continued British subjugation to Brussels. “Soft Brexit” is what the latter really means. GETTY ‘We were a great nation before the era of EU-driven mass immigration’, says McKinstry \nIt is should more honestly be called “Fake Brexit” because it is withdrawal from the EU in name only; all the features of federalist domination will remain. \n“Fake Brexit” will require Britain still to accept complete free movement, membership of the Customs Union and the Single Market, compliance with EU regulations, hefty contributions to the coffers of Brussels, welfare for EU migrants and jurisdiction by the European Courts. \nThis is certainly not what the majority of the British voters backed last June. It is not freedom at all but just another form of colonial rule by the Eurocrats. \nEffectively Britain would still be a member of the Brussels empire, which is why the Remoaners so vociferously favour this approach. The alternative to the “Fake” policy is “Real Brexit”. \nWhat the Remoaners misleadingly call “hard” is just the fulfilment of the referendum result. \n“Real Brexit” entails control of our own borders, taxes, justice system and trade, as well as the restoration of Parliamentary sovereignty and the supremacy of our own laws. \nWithout such steps, the process of leaving will be a charade, an illusion that leaves the EU in charge. \nOn the vital question of free movement, which is the biggest issue of concern to voters, a nation that does not control its own borders is not a free nation. \nThe Remoaners pretend that mass EU immigration is the engine of our prosperity. But voters recognise that the numbers are completely unsustainable, imposing an intolerable burden on our civic infra-structure, living standards and welfare state. \nOn the Government’s own figures, no fewer than 284,000 EU migrants settled here last year, though that is probably a gross underestimate since 227,000 NI numbers were issued to Bulgarians and Romanians alone. \nThe EU is obsessed with free movement because it not only promotes the concept of European citizenship by breaking down national identities but also eases the pressures caused by mass unemployment in the failing Eurozone. \nBut we should have no part of this malignant ideological project which is ruining the fabric of our nation. GETTY ‘’Fake’ Brexit is a defeatist, unpatriotic counsel of despair’, says McKinstry \nWe were a great nation before the era of EU-driven mass immigration and we can be again when we achieve “Real Brexit”. \nThe same is true of the other features of self-governance. It is absurd to believe that a country like ours, with all our resources and rich heritage, cannot manage to run our own trade or protect our own civil liberties without Brussels interference. \nBut that is precisely what too many of the Remoan crowd think. “Provincial bigots” and “dim people up north who are frightened of garlic have narrowed our horizons,” wailed one metropolitan designer after the referendum result. \n“Fake” Brexit is a defeatist, unpatriotic counsel of despair. “Real Brexit” is a reassertion of faith in our nation.
