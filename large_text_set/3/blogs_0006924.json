It's dead. \n\"I'm talking to him about another proposal for another fight, not Khan. Khan won't be Manny's next opponent.\" \nPacquiao, 38, who currently holds the WBO welterweight title, had tweeted last month: \"Negotiations between team Pacquiao and team Khan have come to terms for the April 23 bout as this is what the fans wanted.\" Amir Khan was beaten by Canelo Alvarez in his latest fight last May \nKhan had posted in February: \"My team and I have agreed terms with Manny Pacquiao and his team for a super fight #pacquiaokhan #April23rd.\" \nPacquiao continues to be trained by Freddie Roach but Khan left the American in September 2012 and is now under the tutelage of Virgil Hunter. \nKhan's last fight in May 2016 was at 155lbs, when he challenged Mexico's Saul Alvarez for the WBC middleweight title but lost in six rounds . \nHe has long spoken of fighting in the UAE, where he has a southern Asian fanbase, and of his desire to test himself against either Pacquiao or Floyd Mayweather, two of the greatest fighters of the modern era.
