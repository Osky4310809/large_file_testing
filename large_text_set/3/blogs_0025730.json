I don’t think so. I think politics has changed. I think we’re doing great damage do to the judiciary.” \nThe theme of the hearings, Graham said, has been, “If you don’t agree with my basic view of the world, I can’t vote with you.” \nGraham has some credibility on this issue, having voted for the two Obama nominees who received confirmation hearings – Justices Sotomayor and Kagan – despite that their views were very different from his own.  1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:14:22.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
