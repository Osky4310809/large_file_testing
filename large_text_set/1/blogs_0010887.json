Her daughters Natalie, nine, and Suzie, five, go to school in Haringey. She said: “No school should be underfunded. But parents are being asked to make up shortfalls. \n“Where does that leave schools whose parents can’t afford to do that? The Government is cutting funding for our schools but pretending they’re not.” \nPrimary and secondary schools in the capital are now resorting to asking for voluntary contributions from families. \nMuswell Hill school, for four- to 11-year-olds, has requested £30 a term. Its head, in a letter seen by the Standard, blamed “testing times”. He said the money would let the school continue to deliver “the highest standards of education”. \nSimon Wantman, chair of governors, said: “It’s not unusual for schools to ask for voluntary contributions towards school activities and our community have largely been very supportive.” \nFortismere School, also in Muswell Hill, has asked parents for £25 per family a term. Head Helen Glass and Mark Chapman, chair of governors, said it was faced with “unprecedented financial challenges”. \nIn October, Latymer Grammar School in Enfield said it was asking for up to £50 from parents due to a “significant financial shortfall”. Haringey is particularly affected, with its primary and secondary schools facing real-term funding reductions of up to 17 per cent between 2013 and 2019. \nFair Funding for All Schools — backed by MP Catherine West, Haringey council chief Claire Kober and the National Union of Teachers — has had reports of schools having to increase class sizes or not replacing staff who have left. \nA new government national funding formula is being introduced from 2018 to 2019, which increases money targeted at schools with additional needs including deprivation. The changes will mean more than 10,000 schools will gain funding, it has been suggested. \nToday, unions claimed every parliamentary constituency in England will see schools face funding cuts in the next few years. Some schools will lose more than £1,000 per pupil, according to an analysis based on government figures. \nThe Department for Education said: “These figures are fundamentally misleading.
