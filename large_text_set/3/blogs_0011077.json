The ones which have been perilously stuck on 99.9999% for a couple of ominous weeks. Lukaku has emerged as the Toffees leading man (Photo: Everton FC) \nEverton have not given up on changing the 23-year-old's mind and it is believed the club's position is that a deal remains on the table; with outright rejection not something Raiola has presented to them as a fait accompli. \nSo what next? Greg O'Keeffe digs in... Read More 1) The deal remains unsigned and Lukaku pushes for a summer exit Lukaku celebrates scoring against West Brom (Photo: Everton FC via Getty Images) \nAs it stands this must be considered a likely outcome. But aside from the galling prospect of losing their best player, there are some positives from a bleak scenario, \nFor starters, it would mean Everton have not conceded to the exit clause Lukaku wanted, believed to be in the region of £70million. The very suggestion that he requested a clause at that figure hinted at a desire to make his Goodison exit easier and more likely. \nEverton's position was that any clause would be no less than £90million. Europe's mega rich clubs on the search for a top striker may see £70million as a relative snip. \nIn market terms, it under-values a young centre forward who has scored, 17, 16, 20, and 25 goals in his last four seasons. \nIf another Raiola client Paul Pogba was worth £89million last summer, what price Lukaku this July? Why should it be any less than the record fee which saw the France midfielder swap Turin for Manchester?

Why should they agree to a value which would see them potentially lose money hand over fist? \nNot only perhaps the £20million difference between £70million and £90million but the approximately £2.4million which they would pay the striker in extra wages under the proposed new deal between April and July. \nBillionaires don't become billionaires by being prepared to write off nearly £23million to chance. \nFarhad Moshiri and his fellow deal-maker Bill Kenwright have previously been rigorous in ensuring Everton are not bullied in the market. Witness the way John Stones exited last year.

He is determined to finish the campaign as the Premier League's top marksman, which can only be a plus for the Blues. Read More 2) Lukaku signs his deal with a newly negotiated exit clause There's no doubt Koeman has helped improve his centre-forward (Photo: Everton FC via Getty) \nThe player is happy and extra motivated to finish what may yet be his swansong season with a spring in his step and goals from his boots. \nThen if a Champions League club matches the compromised clause in the summer, he leaves for pastures new and the Blues still get an eye-watering fee - albeit not one they have had the chance to inflate further by an open auction. 3) The deal remains unsigned, and Lukaku does not leave in the summer Romelu Lukaku arrives (Photo: Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty) \nThere is always the possibility Everton could price their forward out of the market once the window opens. Lukaku has undoubted world class potential but he has never had the chance to play in the Champions League yet. \nEven though most observers will tell you he is sure to take to that competition smoothly, prospective buyers would argue there are no guarantees. \nThey might use his relative lack of inexperience as a bargaining chip, and Everton may be in no mood to bargain.That would mean they have him for the start of next term, at least until January - maybe until summer 2018. \nIn that case Ronald Koeman would have to hope he could prevent Lukaku from sulking, downing tools or simply losing form because he was disenchanted. \nShould it reach that summer, then Everton may have to accept a smaller fee with only 12 months left on the Belgian's deal. \nHowever if the Blues break into the top four next season, all bets are off. They could feasibly match his ambition and keep him as he enters his golden years. Read More 4) The deal remains unsigned and Lukaku stays for the remainder of his contract Two more years? (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nAs above there's the not unrealistic chance that by summer 2019, Everton could be in the Champions League. \nThat has the potential to change everything. \nIf not and - as unlikely as it seems - Lukaku has been held to the full length of his deal, he could sign a pre-contract with foreign clubs in January 2019 and they risk losing a mega-star for nothing.
