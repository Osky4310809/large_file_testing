The CIA's Remote Devices Branch, known as UMBRAGE, is capable of - or is - watching you everywhere you go, even when you think they're not or such surveillance would seem impossible.\nThe question about whether President Trump was tapped has been reduced to a joke. The real questions are how often and from how many places. The answer would probably shock us, if we were ever to learn the truth. (And did President Obama know what they were doing? Either that or the CIA, FBI or NSA wasn't telling him. You decide.)\nThe Wikileaks documents (everyone believes their downloads now) show how the CIA, via their eerily-named \"Weeping Angel\" program, has devised a method of listening to us through our Smart TVs. Even when we think they're off, they are able to keep them on - and recording - through a \"fake-off\" program.\nJust how many Smart TV's does Donald Trump - a known television addict - watch in a day? Who is he talking to at the time? A foreign leader perhaps? And what is he saying in supposed confidence?\nThese days it's hard to buy a television that isn't a Smart TV. The Wikileaks documents show only the popular Samsung has been hacked, but since the agency assiduously hacks both Apple and Android cellphones, one can assume all major brands are covered. (They're not stupid. We are.)\nAnd that's far from their only way of listening in. Tyler Durden - considerably more tech savvy than I - expresses the amazement of that community that the CIA was able to bypass the purportedly powerful cellphone data security apps (Signal, Telegram) so many business executives, politicians and journalists rely upon, even to using our own anti-virus programs (McAfee, etc.) to spy on us. They also, apparently, can control our cars through the latest automobile computers. (NOTE TO SELF: Skip the Apple CarPlay upgrade.)\nFurther, Durden Quote: s Twitter star Kimdotcom's instant observation that the DNC/Russian hacking connection is also now a joke (at least highly suspect) since the CIA also has a program, via UMBRAGE again, to imitate Russian hacking techniques and leave the Russky's \"fingerprints\" on their own handiwork. Could the CIA have hacked the DNC and then blamed it on the Russians for some purpose? It seems unlikely, but anything's possible in this crazy and increasingly bizarre and alienating world. If it is true, don't look now, but our country just exploded.\nOur hope, for now, is in the congressional investigations, but it's hard to have much confidence in them. The media, of course, is ludicrous. They have clearly become the witting/unwitting lackeys of all manner of leakers from any number of intelligence agencies. It's become dizzying as the internal contradictions mount up daily. ( Who told you there was a FISA order again? Oh, wait...) The New York Times and the Washington Post , among others, have reached self-parody in their cock-eyed denials of what they asserted only weeks ago, while the CIA grows progressively more partisan and ominously totalitarian in its values and methods.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/rogerlsimon/2017/03/07/wikileaks-cia-download-confirms-everybodys-tapped-including-trump/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/", "http://www.reellifewisdom.com/taxonomy/term/the_palm_beach_story", "http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-07/wikileaks-hold-press-conference-vault-7-release-8am-eastern"], "published": "2017-03-08T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:46:00.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
