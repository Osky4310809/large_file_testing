Some women also showed off their mastectomy and breast reconstruction scars, which we think is brave and they all looked beautiful. \nDesigner and breast cancer survivor Dana Donofree started AnaOno for women with breast cancer. The bras are wire-free to prevent discomfort and pain for women whoâ€™ve undergone surgery. The robes also have pockets to place a drain belt during post-op. \nAll the proceeds from the show will go to non-profit organization Cancerland to help out breast cancer patients with their treatments and medication.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:29:08.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
