Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nI’ve racked up dozens of hours wearing Beats X wireless earphones over the past month, and I still think they blow away the competition — even Apple’s AirPods. \nFor Cult of Mac’ s latest video review, I’ve put together a definitive list of my thoughts on the innovative earpods. Beats X review: One month later \nMy main takeaway in terms of wearability is just how well-fitting the Beats X earbuds are. They create a seal in my ears, which blocks out almost all background noise. They’re also incredibly comfortable, which means they can be worn in bed to listen to a podcast or music while dozing off, without any problems. The fact that they don’t draw unwanted attention, as Apple’s futuristic-looking white AirPods can, is also a plus for me.\nBeats X earbuds also work very slickly, thanks to Apple’s wireless W1 chip. They’re not totally wireless, but the cord that connects the earbuds is specially designed not to get tangled. \nThe Beats X battery life is particularly spectacular. \nBest of all is the sound, which is superior to any Beats headphones I’ve tried in the past. \nHave you tried the Beats X earphones? What are your headphones of choice right now?
