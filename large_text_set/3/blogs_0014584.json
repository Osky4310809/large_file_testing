No self-respecting business would send its employees abroad armed only with an EHIC. Most business travellers should expect to be covered by private insurance, not least to be able to access services that the EHIC does not cover. The Association of British Insurers points out that the really pricey stuff, like repatriation, is not included within the scheme. But firms offering business-travel insurance will factor in the free treatment available in the EEA when setting premiums. Were this to disappear, the price of cover would no doubt rise, and access to treatment would become more complicated. Combined with the weak pound and the potential rise in airfares if Britain fell out of the EU open-skies arrangement (something Mr Davis also hinted was possible), this would turn jaunts abroad into a luxury. It may well lead firms to scrap those of marginal benefit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:24:35.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
