( SNAP ) may have gone public only a week ago, but that hasn’t stopped at least one on Wall Street analyst from speculating that Facebook Inc. ( FB ) could step in to buy the company behind Snapchat, the popular disappearing-message app. \nFBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi initiated coverage of Snap on Thursday with a sector perform rating and price target of $23, owing in part to the fact the Facebook may want to acquire it. According to Seyrafi, Facebook would “love to acquire” Snap and may be willing to fork over more than $20 billion, or $14 a share, for the company. “If this is so, then investors in SNAP effectively have a ' put ' at around $14/share. Remember that Facebook paid $21.8 [billion] for WhatsApp, a company [that], although it had more users than SNAP, was not generating any real revenue,” Seyrafi wrote in a research noted covered by Street Insider . According to the analyst, some of the reasons Facebook may want to make a move for Snap is that it already tried to buy it back in 2013, and if a deal was made, it would remove one of the long-term threats facing Facebook’s business, wrote the analyst.

FBN Analyst Says His Assessment Is Speculative \nIn a subsequent interview with Business Insider , the analyst reiterated he doesn’t have inside knowledge and that his assessment is speculative. What’s more, the analyst cautioned that Snap co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy may not want to sell even if its investors think that would be the best move for the company. The pair rejected a $3 billion offer from Facebook in 2013. Although Facebook buying Snap is purely speculative at this point, it certainly is interested in mimicking Snap when it comes to rolling out new features. On Thursday, Facebook launched another Snapchat clone: Messenger Day. With it, Facebook users can post videos and pictures within the Messenger app that disappear after 24 hours. Users can also add filters and effects to their videos and photos in Messenger, very similar to Snapchat’s Stories platform. \nLast week, Snap went public on the stock market, with IPO shares trading more than 40% higher than its $17 issue price , giving the company on the first day of trading a market capitalization of $28.33 billion. Since then the shares have declined a bit, finishing Thursday’s trading session at $22.71, down nearly 23% from its high of $29.44.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T04:56:40.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
