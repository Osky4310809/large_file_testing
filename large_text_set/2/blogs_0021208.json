We’ve seen how that can spell calamity at PGA National. Here are Fore Things that were noteworthy from the third round: \n1. It’s Rickie Fowler ’s tournament to close. Though Fowler has won three PGA Tour titles, he’s 0-for-4 trying to close out a 54-hole lead or share of the lead on Tour. He’s 1-for-5 worldwide. That remarkable finish at The Players two years ago, when Fowler showed some fierce finishing skills coming home to win, didn’t technically count as closing out, but it felt like it should. \n2. Even if Fowler doesn’t prevail, the run of 20-something winners is still in play. Tyrell Hatton, 25, is second, three shots back and Emiliano Grillo, 24, is tied for third, six shots back. Players in their 20s have won 10 of the 14 PGA Tour events staged this year. \n3. Hatton looks like he wants to be a household name in the states. The 25-year-old Englishman has very quietly climbed to No. 18 in the Official World Golf Ranking and is starting a run of U.S. PGA Tour events to get ready for the Masters. He won the Alfred Dunhill Links last year and made his presence felt in the majors, recording a pair of top 10s at The Open and PGA Championship . \n4. Sean O’Hair may be quietly building up to something special. With a 65 Saturday, O’Hair moved into a tie for third, six shots back. The four-time PGA Tour winner is looking for his first victory in six years. He opened this year with a tie for 11 th at the Sony Open and a tie for ninth at the Career Builder Challenge.
