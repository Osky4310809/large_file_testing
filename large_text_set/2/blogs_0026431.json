Bernie Sanders and Bill Nye is going to #BreakTheInternet . \nYou’ll be able to watch the conversation live via Sanders’ Facebook page at 10:30a (ET). But don’t worry. If you miss it, Creationist Ken Ham will be calling attention to it for the rest of his life. \nGiven the political environment we’re in, it’ll be nice to see facts and evidence take center stage for once. \nThis also means you can finally make use of all your “Sanders/Nye 2020” signs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:23:52.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
