They’re cut like action movies. Where’s the counternarrative? Where are we telling these kids that they can be heroes in our stories?” \nParliament had invited Ahmed to speak about diversity — a word he rejected because it sounded like “a little bit of spice” sprinkled onto a mostly white entertainment industry. Instead, he warned that the industry’s failure to speak to minorities could prove fatal when a shadow film industry run by terrorists churned out slick propaganda made just for them. \nThe actor directed most of his criticism toward the British film industry and its penchant for “all-white period dramas.” But his experience in the United States hadn’t been all rosy either. \n“I’m getting on the plane to L.A. to attend the ‘Star Wars’ premiere, and I still get that second search before I board,” said Ahmed, who played the pilot Bodhi Rook in the Star Wars movie “Rogue One” last year. \nGrowing up in a Pakistani Muslim family in Britain, he recalled his mother yelling “ASIAN!” every time someone who looked vaguely like him appeared on TV. \n“Every time you see yourself in a magazine or a billboard, TV, film, it’s a message that you matter,” Ahmed told Parliament. \nAhmed said he nearly turned down drama school. “I didn’t think there was any future in my playing Cabdriver No. 2,” he said.

Whether at the ballot box with the ascendance of populism.” \nIn 2015, The Washington Post spoke to filmmakers who had been inside the Islamic State’s slick propaganda machine , which had advanced well beyond the crude videotapes of al-Qaeda. [ In a propaganda war against ISIS, the U.S. tried to play by the enemy’s rules ] \n“What they described resembles a medieval reality show,” the reporters wrote. “Camera crews fan out across the caliphate. … Battle scenes and public beheadings are so scripted and staged that fighters and executioners often perform multiple takes and read their lines from cue cards.” \nThe United States and its allies are trying to counter those stories but have so far failed , Ahmed said in his speech. \n“It’s a noble failure,” he said. But a very dangerous one “when centrifugal forces are threatening to tear us apart.” \n“If we fail to represent people in our mainstream narratives, they’ll switch off,” he said. “They’ll retreat to fringe narratives, to filtered bubbles online, and sometimes even off to Syria.” \nMore reading:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:38:13.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
