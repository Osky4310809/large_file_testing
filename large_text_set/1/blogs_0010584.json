Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State meets Abians in Diaspora at the Government House, Umuahia. \nThe governor who spoke during an interactive/dinner session with some Abians in the diaspora at the Banquet Hall, Governor’s Lodge, Umuahia, assured that the target will be met. \nGovernor Ikpeazu told the gathering that to enable the state meet this target, his government is committed to improving revenue collection processes to block leakages, as well as ensure rapid improvements in road infrastructure at Aba and Umuahia as additional incentive for citizens and residents to pay all statutory revenue. \n“Our target for 2017 is to hit N2.5b monthly IGR. When we came in, the internal revenue profile of the state stood at N500,000 monthly. We have been working very hard on this, especially in Aba and as at today, we have hit N1b. We are not satisfied yet. Our immediate target is to hit N2.5b by December 2017, so that we can be able to pay salaries without going to Abuja.” \nHe added: “A businessman from Abia State is collaborating with the State Government to develop and commercialize the large cashew plantations around the Umunneochi area. This man plans to establish cashew plantations across the state and build cashew processing plants to produce cashew for consumption”. \nThe Governor appealed to Abians in the diaspora to support his government by investing at home, promoting made in Aba goods/services and representing the state well at their countries of residence. \nGovernor Ikpeazu further implored them to avoid engaging in crimes as “crimes offer no sustainable benefit and as people of God’s own state we must live exemplary lives for others to emulate”.
