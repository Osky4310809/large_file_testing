It’s wrong to use vague terms, provided by our trusted sources, to comment on Bukalapak’s financial health. I was also blindsided by the acquisition talk news and failed to take a closer look at the entire story until I had the time to digest the story, speak to my editorial team, and understand our processes on Friday late evening.\nWe have removed all financial commentaries in this article to reflect more accurate reporting. The news about Tokopedia and Bukalapak in acquisition talk is legit so that will stay.\nTech in Asia’s mission is to build and serve Asia’s tech communities. We started as a media company to help bridge the information gap within the tech ecosystem in Asia. But today, we failed you because we wrote things that aren’t accurate and we are terribly sorry about it. My team and I promise that Tech in Asia will learn and continue to improve .\nSincerely\nWillis Wee\nCEO and founder, Tech in Asia\nThis post We are very sorry, Bukalapak appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T14:55:07.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
