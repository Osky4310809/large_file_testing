NASA CM America today, as an exhibit at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Lee Hutchinson I was sitting with Apollo 7 veteran Walt Cunningham in his west Houston living room on Monday afternoon when his wife, Dot, stepped tentatively in. \"I'm sorry for interrupting,\" she said. \"But Gene's dead.\"\nShe meant Eugene Cernan, the US Navy Captain who commanded Apollo 17, and the last person to walk on the Moon. He was 82 and had been ill for about six months.\nWe took a moment to process this. Six of NASA's 12 Apollo Moonwalkers were now dead. The other six are in their 80s or older. And for Cunningham, this was personal. Cernan served as back-up to Cunningham as the Lunar Module pilot on Apollo 7, the first flight of the Apollo capsule. Cunningham sighed. \"I guess that's the way it is,\" he said. \"I'll be 85 in two months. I'm starting to face up to the fact that everybody I know is going to be gone soon, and probably me too.\"\nA patriot and pioneer Born on March 14, 1934, Cernan was a Boy Scout, Purdue University engineer, and fighter pilot before joining NASA in 1963 as part of its third astronaut class. He flew the Gemini 9A mission to test orbital rendezvous, served as Lunar Module Pilot aboard the Apollo 10 that flew to within 15.6km of the Moon, and commanded the last human mission to the surface. \"America has lost a patriot and pioneer who helped shape our country's bold ambitions to do things that humankind had never before achieved,\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said Monday.\nCernan was never comfortable with the title \"last man to walk on the Moon.\" But he couldn't escape it and, even titled his autobiography, Last Man on the Moon . \"Too many years have passed for me to still be the last man to have walked on the Moon,\" he wrote in the 1999 book. \"Somewhere on Earth today is the young girl or boy, the possessor of indomitable courage, who will lift that dubious honor from me and take it us back out there where we belong.\"\nCernan sits in a boilerplate Gemini mockup during water egress training, April 1966. NASA Suit adjustments for testing out the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit, the handheld device to assist Cernan with moving around during Gemini IX's planned EVA. February 1966. NASA This photo (taken by Cernan) shows what he saw while standing in Gemini IX's cabin with the hatch open. June 1966. NASA Gemini IX's Augmented Target Docking Adapter (ADTA) failed to properly open, preventing Gemini IX from docking with the target. The failure earned the ADTA the nickname \"The Angry Alligator.\" NASA A closer view of the \"Angry Alligator\" ADTA from Gemini IX's cockpit. NASA Cernan in the cramped Gemini IX cockpit while in orbit. Gemini spacecraft had about as much usable crew space as the front seat of a 1960s-era Volkswagen Beetle. Cernan and crewmate Tom Stafford shared that space for three days. NASA Even in 1991, Cernan was already disappointed by the outward progress of human spaceflight. Reflecting on the lunar landings, he said, \"I knew we wouldn't be back in ten years, but we're talking about as many as thirty-five or forty years he said And that's a generation and a half. The kids who are in grammar school now are the people who are going to be taking those trips back to the Moon and on to Mars. So we've got a generation in there that we've left in limbo.\"\nWhen are we going back? Those grammar school students in 1991 are now in their mid-to-late 30s. It is not at all clear whether any of them will go back to the Moon, or Mars, or anywhere beyond low Earth orbit. Sure, NASA has a plan for a \"Journey to Mars,\" but there's widespread recognition that this mission on paper is poorly funded and unlikely to succeed without substantially more money and commitment from Congress and the White House. Lunar landings, at best, might come toward the end of the 2020s. Mars? The late 2030s.\nEven before Cernan came home from the Moon in 1972, the federal government had begun cutting funding for NASA from nearly 5 percent of the budget to less than 0.5 percent today. This level of funding has allowed the space agency to produce some momentous achievements, including the exploration of all the worlds in our Solar System and—with the Voyagers—beyond. NASA built the technically marvelous space shuttle and led construction of the International Space Station.\nCernan's official Apollo 10 portrait.

NASA Launch Vehicle SA-505 powers into orbit on 18 May 1969, with exhaust from the first stage's five F1 engines stretching for more than a thousand feet (the launch vehicle itself is 363 feet long, or about 110 meters).

LMP Gene Cernan, CDR Tom Stafford, and LMP John Young prepare to step off the helicopter onto recovery ship USS Princeton on 26 May 1969. After landing, the crew of Apollo 10 meets with the crew of Apollo 11 to compare notes. Two months later, Apollo 11 would land humans on the Moon for the first time. NASA But as Cernan recognized, it is one thing to have humans explore the vicinity of our home planet and quite another to send them into the great beyond. \"There is a difference between a space program that takes you to 300 miles away from your home planet and another one that sets you out on a voyage a quarter million miles away,\" he said. \"There are significant differences, both technologically and philosophically. And, quite frankly, I'm a little disappointed in us, at this time, to know that we're really not much further along than we were back then.\"\nPerhaps we as a country can now, finally, dedicate ourselves to a sustainable, coherent plan to send humans back into deep space. This will require funding, yes, but equally important is common ground on what the aims of human exploration ought to be. NASA must harness the vast gains now being made in commercial space, both in terms of lower costs and reusability. With Cernan's passing we are reminded (and hopefully embarrassed) how very, very long it has been since humans have left low Earth orbit.\nLet us hope we can return to the Moon before all our Moonwalkers are gone.\nListing image by NASA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T03:41:01.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
