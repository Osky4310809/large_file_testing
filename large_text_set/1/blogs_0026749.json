It’s a pleasure for me to come to England for the first time and I am really happy to get to know the Premier League. \n“I am really looking forward to joining the team.” \nExecutive Director of Football Les Reed added: “Mouez is a promising young goalkeeper, and we are very pleased to have been able to bring him to Southampton. \n“He has built an excellent reputation during his time with Nice and also in his country’s youth teams, and will provide us with further depth in the months ahead. \nThe Pressure Index: Fraser Forster \n“As well as adding to our squad, we believe Mouez can continue his development in his time at Southampton and make strides in his own game under the expert guidance of our Head of Goalkeeping, Dave Watson, as well as working alongside Fraser Forster. \n“Harry Lewis has had opportunities and gained great experience while Alex McCarthy has been injured, and Stuart Taylor has brought excellent experience to the group, and now Mouez will add to our strength in depth.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:25:18.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
