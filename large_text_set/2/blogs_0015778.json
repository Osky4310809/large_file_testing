Photo: Apple \nDevelopers and members of Apple’s public beta software program can now install the latest beta of macOS 10.12.4 after Apple seeded the new update to testers this morning. \nThe new beta comes just one day after Apple gave developers a new fresh of software update for iOS 10.3, tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2, bringing a bunch of bug fixes and under the hood improvements. \nThe public beta for iOS 10.3 beta 3 can also be downloaded by testers starting today, though there aren’t as many new features in it as the last two beta builds. If you’re not a member of Apple’s public beta testing program you can still sign up on the company’s site and get immediate access to all the new software. What’s in macOS 10.12.4? \nOne of the biggest new features in macOS 10.12.4 is the addition of Night Shift mode that came to iOS devices last year. Other improvements include cricket scores for Siri, Shanghainese dictation support, improved PDFKit APIs, and more. \niOS 10.3 contains new features like Find My AirPods, iCloud calls for Verizon, a secret one-handed keyboard for iPads, CarPlay tweaks and the new Apple File system that increases encryption on iPhones and iPads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:06:13.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
