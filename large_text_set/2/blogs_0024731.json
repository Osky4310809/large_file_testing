It shows his absolute lack of interest in procedures,\" Mr Cullinane said. \nActing Dail chairman Declan Breathnach told Mr Cullinane to sit down and show \"a small bit of manners\" before allowing Mr Collins finish his speech. \nThe WRC case centres on a claim that Sinn Fein unfairly dismissed Ms Booth, a young mother-of-three, after the General Election. Ms Booth worked in Meath West TD Peadar Toibin's constituency office in Navan but claims she was employed by and answerable to Sinn Fein senior management. \nThe party confirmed it supplemented Ms Booth's salary every week but denies it was her employer. It also said it paid her wages during the General Election campaign as Mr Toibin was technically no longer a TD. \nHowever, Sinn Fein maintains that Ms Booth signed a fixed-term employment contract with Mr Toibin, which expired once the election was called. \nThe young mother worked full-time for Mr Toibin for the two years leading up to the General Election. Mr Toibin got his highest-ever vote and returned to the Dail after the votes were counted. However, Ms Booth claimed she was told by the TD she would have to re-apply for her job. \nShe also claimed Mr Toibin told her she should keep her options open as he had \"no power\" over employment decisions. Sinn Fein claims Ms Booth told the TD she had found another job and would not be reapplying for the role. \n\"It is impossible to separate the TD and the party in terms of work done. She was the only member of staff working in an office that also serves the councillors and party members,\" Ms Booth stated in her affidavit. \n\"Nobody in Sinn Fein is permitted to work independently, to do so would be reprehensible and considered a breach of policy,\" she added. \nLike all TDs, Sinn Fein representatives are paid €87,258 before tax. However, they are only permitted to earn the average industrial wage of around €38,500 - although this has increased by €2,000 recently. \nUnder Sinn Fein rules, each TD gives a €2,500 donation to the party as this is the highest amount allowed under Standard in Public Office Commission (Sipo) rules. \nThe remaining €47,000 is used to hire additional constituency staff or pay for local political expenses.
