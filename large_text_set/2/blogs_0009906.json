A report from the MIT news website, citing Britain’s Chartered Trading Standards Institute, claims that “of 400 counterfeit chargers it bought from a range of online retailers, 397 failed a basic safety test.”\nThe solution is a wireless charger which uses a cryptographic authentication technique known as elliptic curve cryptography. Through this process, an electronics device can verify the wireless charger it’s sitting on and halt the charge if the unit fails the authentication test.\nThe MIT researchers say that the technology would also house another benefit: charging two devices simultaneously would occur at a more even pace. Current wireless charging effectiveness depends on proximity of the devices to the internal electrical coil but the MIT solution would mean that one device isn’t left behind while the other grabs all of the juice.\nSee also: Wireless charging technology: what you need to know January 11, 2017 The developments have been sponsored by MIT Lincoln Labs, Texas Instruments, and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and could go a long way to discouraging the sale of counterfeit products, should they be implemented on a wide scale.\nThe MIT report also references research from Apple from late 2016, where the Cupertino company claimed that “of 100 Apple-branded charging accessories it bought on Amazon, 90 were counterfeits.”\nThough smartphone manufacturers have a financial motivation to make you fear third-party chargers or those from other manufacturers, if you do want the official product, I’d visit the manufacturer website rather than sellers on Amazon or eBay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:03:00.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
