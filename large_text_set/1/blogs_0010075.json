It's almost like you're there with Hairston, experiencing the turmoil of learning that you'll have to leave behind friends and fans and move to a new city.\nSan Diego residents rejected a proposal in November to help fund a new $1.8 billion stadium downtown.\nWith that rejection, it looks like Chargers chairman, Dean Spanos, decided it's time for the team to leave its home of 55 years and join the newly arrived Rams as the second NFL team in Los Angeles.\nCongratulations, Tinseltown. Not only are you getting another football team, you are gaining an emoji Shakespeare.\nBONUS: New smart ball is a learning tool specially designed for autistic children", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/m0CX2Ptk.jpg", "https://twitter.com/C_Hairston75/status/819389008413265920", "http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/18455802/chargers-expected-announce-move-san-diego-los-angeles", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/m0CX2Ptk.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-12T12:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T06:56:49.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
