Share Nasri has sold his house for a pretty penny (Photo: MEN Media/Action Images via Reuters) Share Get football   \nManchester City's out-on-loan midfielder Samir Nasri has sold his lavish Cheshire home for a cool £5.75million. \nNasri, spending the season with Spanish side Sevilla, had put his eight bedroom mansion on the market back in October, reports the Manchester Evening News. \nThe French ace had been renting out the property during his time with City, who paid £25million to take him from Arsenal in 2011. \nSet back on the 30 acre, private plot in the exclusive Alderly Edge area, the amazing home opens up into a marble entrance hall with a spiral staircase and floor to ceiling windows. \nAnd there are of course, the obvious trappings that come as standard in the millionaire’s pad - his and her dressing rooms, a huge wine cellar, the cinema room and state of the art gym. I mean, it looks rather nice!
