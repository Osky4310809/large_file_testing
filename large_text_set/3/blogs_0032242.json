Sir Keir issued a damning assessment of the Prime Minister's character (Photo: South Wales Echo) \nPointing to Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's threat to call a second independence referendum, Sir Keir told the Chatham House foreign affairs think tank : “The Prime Minister's failure to engage with the Scottish Government, or to recognise the specific and particular concerns, has provided an excuse for the SNP to press ahead with its divisive all for a second referendum on the break up Britain. \n“This is, I fear, becoming the defining characteristic of the way the Prime Minister is conducting the process – guarded, closed, unable to build a consensus or form alliances. \n\"Instead of being open and willing to listen on differing views and incredibly complex issues, she's retreated into government by mantra - ' Brexit means Brexit', 'No running commentary', ' No deal is better than a bad deal '; bland phrases designed to shut out dialogue.” \nHe said “different leaders lead in different ways”, adding: “Some are open and collegiate and looking for partnerships; so far our Prime Minister has been closed, unwilling to share her plans.” The Shadow Brexit Secretary also claimed another bitter Tory battle is looming (Photo: Getty) \nSir Keir believed an internal power struggle in the Tory Party is poised to burst into the open when negotiations with the EU intensify, he belived. \n“There is a worrying and increasingly powerful move on the Government's benches to sever our links with Europe. This is the authentic voice of the Brexiteers - those that have argued for decades that exiting the EU offers a once in a generation chance for Britain to extradite itself from the entire European social and economic model.,” he said. \n“Oncer a small minority in the Conservative Party, the Brexiteers are now in office and in power. \n“This ideologically -driven approach to Brexit would be disastrous and divisive.” \nHe added: “The Prime Ministers need to face down these Brexiteers who would distance us from Europe.” Sir Keir plans to hold the Government's feet to the fire over Brexit (Photo: Getty) \nThe hard right's claim that the UK would crash out of the EU without a trade deal was “gaining currency”, he believed, with a Tory civil war inevitable as the divorce talks unfold. \n“There are undoubtedly two camps in the Conservative Party and on the Conservative benches, and there have been for years,” he said. \n“Differences will out over the course of the next two years.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:03:08.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
