In one photograph, Michitane Soma wears a jinbaori made of sik. Abstract geometric symbols also adorn his pants, which are known as \"hakama.\" The symbols are believed to protect the wearer from evil, Brown said; popular designs include dragonfly, dragon and carp motifs. \"The carp symbolizes success, longevity, courage, ambition, and perseverance,\" he said. Photographs of people who participated in the festival in the past and the traditional costumes they wore line the walls of present-day Soma residents' homes, Brown added. One shot per person Brown photographed 44 people -- some from old important samurai families and others whose families have a strong loyalty to the local samurai tradition -- over a 2-year period. \"We only took one photograph for each person, so for each of these portraits there was only one chance per person,\" Brown said. He set up a dark room on location where he made his glass negatives. Each session -- from making the negative to developing it -- took up to 20 minutes, and the photographs needed to be taken while the glass negative was wet. Each individual had to sit still for up to two seconds. Brown said his photographic series serves as both a record and reminder of a difficult time in the Soma residents' history, and now aims to place the images in a local museum. Fostering a cultural dialogue Brown said that since the disaster, many residents of Soma have become more determined to pass the samurai tradition onto the next generation as a source of purpose and identity.
