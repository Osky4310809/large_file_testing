And while Priyanka Chopra and her villain instincts show up for another (almost) blink and miss appearance, we cannot hold our horses to see her on the big screen with the likes of Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. With the two protagonists lying down with the dead in a morgue, Zac dressing up as a “legit hot” girl, and ultimately trying to save the world, this trailer is quite funny! \"Drugs. Murder. A dead body on our beach. And it all started once she took over.\" #BeBaywatch #VictoriaLeeds @baywatchmovie #May26 pic.twitter.com/GRjOpEBqRI", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:13:18.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
