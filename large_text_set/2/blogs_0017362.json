You know, the one where we get to see all her inspired outfits from the Beauty and the Beast press tour !\nSo, today sheâ€™s wowing in a custom blue cut-out Louis Vuitton dress styled by Nicolas Ghesquiere. And because Watson is all about wearing eco-friendly clothing (yes!) wherever possible, the dress fabric is made from recycled materials. The below video shows the front and back of the dress, and Watson struts her stuff like a confident superstar (probably because she, ya know, IS a confident superstar). Here, take a look:\nToday was a brilliant day of interviews, press conferences and photoshoots for @beautyandthebeast in France. We snuck out of the junket and onto the roof of the hotel to capture these shots against the beautiful Paris skyline. Custom @louisvuitton dress designed by @nicolasghesquiere. The dress fabric is Newlife recycled polyester, created from used plastic bottles. These are sourced, mechanically processed and spun into yarns in Italy, with a fully traceable supply chain. This saves energy and reduces CO2 emissions compared to creating brand new polyester fibre. The arm band was created in a carbon-neutral mill. Dress validated by @ecoage #ecoloves \nA post shared by The Press Tour (@the_press_tour) on Feb 20, 2017 at 2:16pm PST \nApart from the fact that Watson looks mind-blowingly mazing in this piece of wearable art, we love how the Eiffel Tower is visible in the background. Sheâ€™s just chillinâ€™ on a rooftop in Paris, no biggie. And we love Watson so much that weâ€™re not even jealous â€” simply happy that our girl is living it up!\nvia GIPHY Now if you want to get a good look at the stunning dress, Ghesquiere posted a photo on his own Instagram.\n@emmawatson @the_press_tour @rebeccacorbinmurray @louisvuitton #beautyandthebeast \nA post shared by ðŸ†– (@nicolasghesquiere) on Feb 20, 2017 at 1:31pm PST \nDamn, the dress is so playful and fun, yet so bold and sophisticated. Yup, weâ€™re already obsessed with Watsonâ€™s fashion Instagram and look forward to the next ensemble!\nvia GIPHY Itâ€™s also always great to see the possibilities with cut-out dresses. Weâ€™ve seen a few others, like Kristen Stewartâ€™s edgy apocalyptic queen dress and Diane Krugerâ€™s cut-out mini dress , and each one has inspired us to experiment with our wardrobes. Why not mix things up every once in a while? Surprise your friends, or surprise yourself!\nThanks for dazzling us with your all-round awesomeness, Emma. We like. A lot.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:09:41.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
