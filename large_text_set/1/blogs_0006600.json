Advertisement \nRossum’s holdout for higher pay than her co-star William H. Macy kept Season 8 on hold, though a deal was eventually struck that places her salary on par. During a TCA panel on Monday, Showtime president David Nevins clarified : “To be clear, parity was justified in this case. We were advocating for that from the beginning. It is great for her and great for us. Emmy has been a force on that show. Not just in front, but behind the cameras. She’ll continue to direct.” \nThe so-called standoff between Rossum and Showtime reportedly came into play when she requested more money than Macy for Season 8, beyond the standard parity guidelines set in place. Via Deadline: Advertisement \nThe studio reportedly offered both Rossum and William H. Macy the same salary under so-called favored nations terms that assure financial parity. As an Oscar nominee with an extensive body of work, Macy had started off with a higher original quote, and Rossum, the series’ breakout star, was to catch up with him. She had been holding out for a salary higher than Macy’s, briefly putting the future of Shameless in limbo. \nSince, as this site has emphasized , Rossum’s character Fiona Gallagher has been the show’s narrative fixture from the beginning—with a much more compelling arc, broader presence and complexity than Macy has in the role of the deadbeat screw-up Frank—it makes total sense that Rossum should eventually surpass him in earnings. Still, great that she’s now at least earning equal pay. As Deadline noted in a December article before the deal: \nWarner Bros. TV, which produces Shameless, is a studio that historically has followed the parity rule to a tee, with such series as Friends and The Big Bang Theory. Creating a precedent on Shameless appears unlikely because that would open the door for similar demands on a host of other successful series. (The next Big Bang Theory contract negotiations are just around the corner).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T17:21:56.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
