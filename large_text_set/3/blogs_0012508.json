Spring means new love, old love and generally just love. And since it’s right around the corner, it comes as no surprise that more couples choose this season to tie the knot. What isn’t quiet as expected is that Broad City’s Ilana Glazer just got married IRL to her longtime boyfriend, David Rooklin.\nIlana stars in the Comedy Central show alongside Abbi Jacobson, where the duo have many misadventures on screen that explore what it means to be best friends, feminists and soul sisters in today’s New York. And even though the two are super close in real life, Ilana still has a boo, and now they are officially husband and wife.\nBelated congrats to these beautiful on getting hitched. Love you hard and deep. You're truly #RelationshipGoals and inspire me. #YQY : @chiokenassor \nA post shared by Phoebe Robinson (@dopequeenpheebs) on Mar 13, 2017 at 9:27am PDT \nIlana and her new hubby married late last month(!), in a very private City Hall ceremony, according to Metro.us. The comedian’s new hubby, Rooklin, works as a scientist who started a company called Redesign Science .\nA post shared by ilana glazer (@ilanusglazer) on Aug 9, 2015 at 2:30pm PDT \nAlthough we’re not sure of all the details, we’re happy for their new relationship status. And even though the couple has not officially announced on their own social media accounts, friends of Ilana and David are posting their congratulations on Instagram.\nI am so mf'ing proud of my amazing bf David. He won a @nyustern business competition for his startup, Redesign Science. Seriously, legit: if he hadn't won, I'd be just as proud bc he and his team put themselves through this business boot camp, but he fuckin won. Dey WONNN. 240 teams down to 3, and Redesign won the biggest prize. And straight up -- we didn't know what was gonna happen. Competition was stiff; these other businesses were SMART and serving necessity. But #sorrynotsorry yall, David and his team won. I love him so much. He's summoning his witch powers to make something out of nothing, and it's working! ⚗ \nA post shared by ilana glazer (@ilanusglazer) on May 23, 2016 at 2:56pm PDT \nCheers to you, Ilana and David! We’ll be watching a re-run of Broad City tonight in your honor.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:53:45.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
