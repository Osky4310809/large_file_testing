(Photo: Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports) \nThe Atlanta Falcons will face the winner of Sunday’s Green Bay-Dallas game next week in the NFC Championship game. If the Cowboys win, the game will be in Dallas, if the Packers win, the game is in Atlanta. \nHow they have fared against the two teams: \nDallas: The teams did not meet in the 2016 regular season. The two haven’t met in the postseason since 1980 when the Cowboys won 30-27 in Atlanta. \nGreen Bay: The Falcons won a 33-32 shootout in Week 7 , when QB Matt Ryan hit Mohamed Sanu with an 11-yard TD pass with 31 seconds remaining. The Packers had taken the lead, 32-26, with 3:58 to go. Their last postseason game against the Packers was 2010 when Green Bay won 48-21 in Atlanta. Facebook Posted!
