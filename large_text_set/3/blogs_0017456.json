Google maps Firefighters work at the scene a fatal three-car collision on White Rock Road on Monday morning. Randy Pench rpench@sacbee.com 1 of 3 i \nBy Bill Lindelof and Cathy Locke \nWhite Rock Road is closed for in indefinite amount of time Monday following a head-on collision that killed two people, according to the California Highway Patrol. \nThe crash involving three vehicles occurred about 8:20 a.m. Monday on White Rock Road near Prairie City Road south of Highway 50. \nOfficer Tommy Riggin, California Highway Patrol spokesman, said a vehicle driven by a 41-year-old El Dorado Hills man was traveling westbound on eastbound White Rock Road at a high rate of speed. Just west of Prairie City Road, it collided head-on with an eastbound vehicle driven by a 21-year-old woman. \nAn eastbound vehicle behind the woman drove into the collision and that vehicle spun out of control. Riggin said the wrong-way driver and the 21-year-old woman were killed. Their names have not been released pending notification of family. \nThe third driver suffered minor to moderate injuries, Riggin said. There were no passengers in any of the vehicles. \nCHP Lt. Brandon Straw said that dispatchers were told by witnesses that the vehicle driven by the El Dorado Hills man was traveling at 80 to 100 mph. A minute later a report was received of the collision. \nIt is unclear so far why the motorist was driving so recklessly on a road with blind curves. \n“We will have to do interviews with people who were close to him, friends and family,” said Straw. “We will want to see what his mind-set was. Driving on the wrong side of the road at the speeds he was going was a tragedy waiting to happen. And it did happen. An innocent person lost her life this morning.” \nThe California Highway Patrol urges motorists to use other routes around the rural location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:29:37.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
