When you hear the name M. Night Shyamalan, you probably instantly know you should be terrified. And he doesn’t disappoint in this first trailer from Tales from the Crypt .\nTales from the Crypt was an anthology TV show that aired from 1989-1996 on HBO (and you can watch a bunch of episodes for free on YouTube!). The show was based on popular EC Comics that tell horrifying tales of monsters and other, well…horrors. And now the show is getting a reboot on TNT from well-known horror director M. Night Shyamalan. And yeah, it looks pretty scary.\nTNT In the trailer, Shyamalan explains what drew him to Tales from the Crypt in the first place:\n“It was edgy. I think it was ahead of its time. This dark, ironic tone is probably the thing that draws me to this source material.” Shyamalan confirms that the Crypt Keeper will be back for the reboot. And since he’s like the creepiest looking dude, that will only make it more terrifying surely.\nTNT So what can we expect from the upcoming reboot? Well now that the show is on cable, they might not be able to get away with as much as they did on HBO. However, judging by the nightmares seen in the trailer, there will still be plenty to keep you up at night! Like this beauty:\nTNT Something very similar happened on Hannibal a few years ago and tbh, still haven’t recovered so who knows what new horrors Tales of the Crypt will put into our brains. You can watch the full trailer here:\nThere’s no word yet on when Tales of the Crypt will premiere but that gives you plenty of time to prepare for the nightmares!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:27:55.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
