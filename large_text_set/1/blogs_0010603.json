Octavia Spencer donned an all-black pantsuit. She is nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture for her role in “Hidden Figures.” Rex/Shutterstock Kathryn Hahn showed up in another all-black ensemble. Her peek-a-boo style bralette is what I presume to be a big “F OFF” to the customary ball gowns on the red carpet. Hahn plays Raquel Fein in “Transparent,” which is up for Best Television Comedy Series. Rex/Shutterstock Evan Rachel Wood, who is up for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role in HBO’s thrilling new series, “Westworld,” channeled David Bowie and Marlene Dietrich. \nWood also told Ryan Seacrest, \nI want every girl to know she can wear a suit. \nUh huh, huney. \nThis year’s Golden Globes will be hosted by Jimmy Fallon, so you can expect some solid lines, a few eye rolls and a lot of shots of Fallon laughing at his own jokes. \nMake sure to watch the 2017 Golden Globes, or at least follow along with Elite Daily’s live coverage of the show so you have something to talk about at work Monday morning and don’t seem like a totally useless, un-pop cultured blob! \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
