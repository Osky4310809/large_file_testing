The lion in this video is a former circus animal held captive for 13 years. When he is finally released back out into the great outdoors, his reaction is simply priceless. With the recent news of Ringling Bros. circus closing down for good , this video is even more special. Watch above to see, and then check out even more amazingly cute animal videos .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:43:23.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
