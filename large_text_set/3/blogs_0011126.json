Josh Hazlewood reacts after bowling a delivery during the third day of their second test cricket match against India in Bangalore, India, Monday, March 6, 2017. (AP Photo/Aijaz Rahi) Source: Supplied From Bendemeer to Bengaluru: Josh Hazlewood’s rise from country prodigy to world conqueror 13 minutes ago by Geoff Newling Source: FOX SPORTS JOSH Hazlewood is the world’s No.1 fast bowler. He’s coming off a career-best performance when he claimed 6-67 to drag Australia back into the second Test at Bengaluru. But what if the 196cm quick had been lost to cricket before his rise to the top even began? \nSports writer Geoff Newling has been front and centre for Josh Hazlewood’s journey from the bush to the baggy green. Here he takes us back to where it all began, on the playing fields of Tamworth in NSW’s North-West. \nTHE BEGINNING \nTHE name Josh Hazlewood first came across my desk in the early 2000s. \nAs the sports editor of The Northern Daily Leader, a regional daily paper head quartered in Tamworth, I received numerous notices, information and sporting teams from various schools, clubs and associations. \nTamworth is the sporting headquarters of North-West NSW having, for many years, produced all manner of fine sportsmen and women from Olympians to Kookaburras and NRL stars to Waratahs. \nJosh was an up and coming cricketer who had been selected to play for NSW in a national primary schools cricket carnival in Barooga on the NSW/Victorian border. \nWe did a story of this talented young pre-teen from Bendemeer Public School earning the chance to represent his state. \nHe was a gangly 11-year-old with, as then, untapped potential. \nBendemeer, for those who don’t know, is a small town of less than 500, about a 30-minute drive north of Tamworth on the New England Highway to Armidale. There are 30 students in the entire school, the same as a single class elsewhere around the country. Josh Hazlewood took career best figures of 6-67 on Tuesday. Source: AFP \nThat very first representative honour wasn’t the first time that I’d heard of the Hazlewood name. \nJosh’s father, Trevor, is a builder with a steel fabrication business while his mother, Ann, is a school teacher and the principal at Woolbrook, another small town about half an hour east of Bendemeer along the Oxley Highway. \nTheir eldest son Aaron had been carving up the junior representative scene with his pace bowling and bludgeoning left-handed batting. He had earned a few headlines of his own in The Leader. \nAt a charity golf day at Tamworth’s Longyard Golf Club, I was introduced to the boys’ father Trevor, a big and happy piece of granite. \nTrevor had been booming drives down the fairways all day. Infectious good humour made him easy to talk to. \nWas he related to Aaron; Yes came the reply and we shared a laugh about his latest exploits, which I had seen first-hand on my travels around the region’s sporting grounds. \nHe also added a rider: “But I’ve got a better one coming along”. It was a proud father telling it how it was. \nWhile Aaron has become an outstanding all-rounder for his Old Boys Club in Tamworth and been part of that first grade side’s three successive premierships in the Tamworth District Cricket Association, Josh just might be the one to watch. Aussie pace rips apart India 2:57 \nTHE POTENTIAL OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALLIST \nThe stroke of luck for Steve Smith and the current crop of Australian players is that Josh focused his talents on cricket and not the other sports at which he excelled. \nAs he made the transition from Bendemeer Public to Oxley High School in Tamworth, Josh’s talents as an all-round athlete were on full display. \nHe developed into a talented exponent of the round ball game, but it was in the ancient Olympic pursuits of javelin, discus and shot-put that he excelled. \nPat Saunders was the North West Schools Sports Association regional sports organiser for a decade at the turn of the century and saw the blossoming young athlete who was starring on the cricket pitch, football fields and in throwing events. \n“I’m fairly certain he might have won gold medals in all three (discus, javelin and shot putt) in the one year and broke the CHS javelin record,” Saunders told me. \n“I think he might have broken (NRL player) Jamal Idris’s record. \n“But he also represented NSW at the primary cricket level and then the NSW CHS Under 15s before he made the CHS Open cricket side. He was also playing for the NSW Under 17 and 19s as well but that was outside of the school system.” \nJosh still holds the Combined High Schools under 13 and under 14s javelin records with Australian experts believing that, had he stuck with throwing, he could have contended for Olympic gold. \nBut it was cricket for Josh and the Hazlewoods, and soon enough the brothers were playing alongside each other in the Old Boys first grade side, the Tamworth rep side and ultimately the Central North Zone’s War Veterans Cup side. \nTHE 13-YEAR-OLD 25-YEAR-OLD \nBen Middlebrook was the first grade captain when Josh made his debut as a 15-year-old, and he remains the captain today. \n“I remember when Josh played his first few fourth grade games for us,” Middlebrook recalled recently. \n“Rod Richards (a former Sydney first grade captain and administrator of the TDCA) umpired this game and saw me after the day’s play had finished. He said: ‘Mate you’ve got a 20 to 25-year-old playing fourth grade. He’s way too good for fourths.’” \nIt turned out to be Josh, who had starred with bat and ball. \n“He was only 12 or 13,” Ben laughed. \nFast forward a couple of years and Josh had forced his way into the Old Boy first grade side. \n“He used to bat in our top four,” Ben said. “He could only bowl so many overs because of the junior bowling restrictions. He’d already smacked a century earlier in the season and in his last three digs scored 195, 145 and then 47 in the grand final when he was halfway down the wicket and given out lbw. \n“He was always going to go somewhere. I think he is the last player to have played for NSW without playing in the Sydney first grade comp.” \nThat was 2008 and he became the youngest bowler to represent at NSW’s cricket’s highest level when aged just 17. Hayden puts hoodoo on Pujara 0:50 \nCentral North Zone chairman, Terry Psarakis, who was still playing when Josh burst into first grade, saw how good Josh was then with both bat and ball from on and off the field. \n“Richard (Rowlings) was our captain (at South Tamworth) and we were playing Old Boys in a one-dayer,” Psarakis said. \n“I told Richard if we bat first it might be the first time a side would declare.” \nThe crafty left-arm finger spinner was batting 11 and, in the twilight of his playing career, was not keen about facing the 130km/h barrage from a teenager destined for greatness. \n“They (Old Boys) won five or six down that day,” he recalled. \n“Richard and Gordon Rae, two of Josh’s Oxley High school teachers, batted pretty well against him too. Josh did bowl quick and he and Aaron got Old Boys home. They took 32 from the last two overs to beat us.” \nRichard Rowlings bowled that final over. \n“We dropped Aaron, a real hard chance, early in that over and he just went bang, bang, bang,” he recalled. \nIt wasn’t the only instance of Josh helping setting up late wins. \nHe did so with a Tamworth Under 14 side, coached by former Country NSW top order bat and wicketkeeper Terry Browne, where he famously smacked a six in the last over to win a rep game one day. \nTAMWORTH’S GOLDEN GENERATION \nAlso in that side was current Southern Stars player Erin Osborne. \nIt was the first time I saw Erin play. I was doing the rounds of the grounds in Tamworth for the many junior games at under 12, 14 and 16 level one Sunday. \nI remember watching the Tamworth side field against an opponent and this young player in a ponytail running in from the boundary, swooping on a ball one-handed and returning to the keeper to run out the opposing batsman by half the pitch. It was a remarkable display of skill. \nI asked: “Who was that?” Erin Osborne, came the reply from the scorer. \nA dozen years or so later and Browne still marvels at the ability in that side. \n“It was an outstanding young side, we had some very good young bowlers as well,” he said. \n“Josh could already bowl, quick, but I like to think I helped him improve his batting, getting his right arm up. But Erin was the real star. Whenever we were in trouble we went to her, for her bowling and her batting.” Erin Osborne and Josh Hazlewood both played for Tamworth. Source: News Corp Australia \nPsarakis feels blessed Tamworth has a male and female Test representative and thinks the pair can only improve. \n“Josh was an outstanding player then, played first grade when he was 15 and scored runs and took wickets too. He was also a major part of our first Country Cup success at the SCG.” \nJosh played in the first two losing SCG Country Cup sides (to Merewether) but then helped Tamworth to its first win against Stockton a year later. \nJeff Cook, a former Sydney first grade all-rounder and English county cricketer, arrived in Tamworth prior to the 2005-2006 season and brought with him a more professional approach for the local players in the rep side. \n“Josh always had the raw talent,” he said. \n“The young blokes just wanted to play. Josh was always asking questions. He trained hard and never missed a session. \n“He’s the same today. When he was home a couple of weeks ago, Josh went down to Old Boys training, had a bowl and talked to all the young players. That’s gold.” \nA WANTED MAN \nCook also remembers a time when the various state associations and Sydney first grade clubs were chasing Josh’s signature. \n“All the Sydney clubs were sniffing around too, Easts, Sutherland, St George, Randwick and Balmain. Trev had a great time, negotiating and enjoying a few trips to big games at the SCG.” \nThat Josh has grown into one of our strike bowlers is a result of nature and nurture. \nHis parents have provided a healthy, balanced and loving home where he and his brother played “Test” matches in the backyard with taped up tennis balls that zinged off the concrete. \nBeing able to play and enjoy other sports as well plays a part while the management and coaching he has received from a multitude of people in Tamworth has been a major factor as well. Josh Hazlewood has always been a very popular man. Source: AP \nWHY TAMWORTH KEEPS PRODUCING THE GOODS \nThat Tamworth has produced outstanding young sportsmen and women such as Australian hockey captain Michael York and fellow Olympians Kim Small and Matt Smith is an example of the perfect blend of nature and nurture. \nThen there are Olympic shooters George and Clive Barton as well, Australian champions in skeet shooting and Sydney Olympian water polo stars Nathan Thomas and Craig Miller. \nJosh Hazlewood, the latest and not the last sporting product from the NSW North-West, is no different. \nHe beat the likes of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Mitch Johnson to the 50 Test wicket-mark. \nIn the Boxing Day Test against Pakistan, he passed the 100-Test wicket mark. \nAt the SCG’s New Year’s Test, he took three second innings wickets, including Pakistani danger man Azhar Ali as the Australians secured a thrilling win. \nA record day five crowd of more than 17,000 cheered him on, as did the sporting community of Tamworth and the North-West – celebrating a local boy from a little town making it to the very top. \nThis article was first published in the Sydney Cricket Ground’s member magazine, Around The Grounds.
