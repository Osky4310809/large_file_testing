To show off its SS17 collection, the New York-based brand tapped Korean photographer Heji Shin to shoot real-life couples having actual sex. The campaign veers close to the edge of porn, but the explicit parts are blurred out.\nAs expected with Eckhaus Latta, known for its gender-fluid designs and street-cast models, the ads show a diverse range of couples engaged in different sex acts to show multiple ways of expressing love or lust.\nIn other fashion news, Palace’s third SS17 drop is coming today.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T14:23:59.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
