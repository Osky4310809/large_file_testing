But there are still people who believe baseless myths associated with a strict fitness regime, that need to be busted. Here are four workout-related myths people need to stop hanging on to. You need to workout every day to see results \nContrary to popular belief, you do not need to workout daily to reach your fitness goals. It is imperative that you take at least two rest days a week, to allow your muscle fibres to rebuild, and prevent exerting your body too much and risking injury. Taking rest days will not mess with your progress or affect your goal, and it will only help your body get stronger. If your body is sore, means you worked out too hard \nSoreness is a given if you're working out, and especially if you are just starting out, or trying out new moves. Your body being sore does not mean that you are working out too hard. Unless you're feeling an unbearable pain, and are unable to move that part of your body (which could be an injury), there is no need to worry about it. Yoga doesn't qualify as a workout \nFirst off, don't believe rumours like these until you try it yourself. And secondly, while yoga may not look as intensive as working out in the gym, it is one of the best whole body workouts you could possibly do. Plus, it helps with the mind as well, and that's an amazing bonus. You need to stretch before you start working out \nIt is definitely a must to stretch post-workout, but before working out, it is more important to do a warm-up. Aim at increasing your mobility, and getting your body ready for major lifting and movement (before working out), by doing some basic warm-up exercises.
