What’s the point of a goddamn wall if angels have wings? Do you really want to refer to Heaven’s Gate ? Heaven doesn’t have extreme vetting. If you accept the divinity of Jesus, you’re in. (Doesn’t that mean we should welcome refugees and immigrants who want to come to America?) Where’s the CPAC panel called “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God”? It’s almost like they’re ignoring the parts of the Bible they don’t like… If the Republican Party and Donald Trump passed the immigration policies they’re proposing, there’s a good chance even Jesus, the rabble-rousing Middle Eastern man, couldn’t come to America. Pushing policy on the basis of what a Holy Book says is precisely what Republicans are afraid of when it comes to Islam. Knowing the kind of conservatives Christians who believe they’re going to Heaven in the afterlife, tell me again why other people are clamoring to enter? Heaven, much like the Republican Party’s sensible immigration policy, doesn’t exist. Come to think of it, the most important word in the panel’s title is “If.” \nOh. And how can anyone represent Colorado’s 10th District, now or in the past, when the state only has seven districts ?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:06:39.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
