(Photo Via Webcast) Amazon’s Alexa reached a new milestone today: 10,000 skills.\nThe company’s digital assistant now has 10,000 skills — the voice equivalent of apps — that third party developers have built for Alexa, which powers Amazon’s popular Echo devices.\nThat’s up from 7,000 in January ; from 5,400 in December ; from 3,000 in September ; and 1,000 in June. In seven months, that’s a 10X increase.\nThe Alexa family. Alexa’s skills include things like the ability to schedule a ride from Lyft, get a pizza delivered, order Starbucks , find a lost phone or hear from former Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch .\nThe 10,000th skill is the “name that tune” game called Beat the Intro.\nAlexa’s proliferation can be partially attributed to Amazon’s decision to open the digital brain up to developers and device manufacturers in 2015. Alexa Voice Service lets manufacturers integrate Alexa into their products. The Alexa Skills Kit encourages third-party developers to build skills for Alexa. Developers who want to add to Alexa’s abilities can write code that works with Alexa in the cloud, letting the smart assistant do the heavy lifting of understanding and deciphering spoken commands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:19:44.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
