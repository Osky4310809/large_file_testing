Of course, it's different now. \n\"They are still a promoted team, but they go into matches with a different standing. Now, they will be the favourites. \n\"They have a very young squad, but with high quality. In any case, they can be expected [to carry on impressing].\" \nBayern captain Philipp Lahm has also been impressed with Leipzig, though he expects Borussia Dortmund to come on strong towards the end of the season after having dire luck with injuries so far. \nHe said: \"Leipzig has played a very good first half of the season. We shall see if they can stay on this level and to collect the points until the end. \n\"For me, Dortmund is still a very strong rival, even though they are far behind us. \n\"We just have to concentrate on us. If we get our points, it will be very, very difficult for the opposition.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:59:35.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
