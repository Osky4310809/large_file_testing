Let’s jump right into the headlines:\nThere are a variety of games on sale in the Google Play Store . Among them are XCOM: Enemy Within, Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath and Munch’s Oddysee, Civilization Revolution 2, and NBA 2K17. Most of them are going for over 50% off. Additionally, they’re all pretty decent games. If you’re looking for strategy, sports, or platforming, these deals are worth checking out. ESET, the antivirus security company, has noticed a rise in ransomware here lately. Their most recent reports shows that Android users were targeted over 50% more often than they were last year. It’s important to note that most of those people probably don’t have Google Play available to them or are installing side-loaded apps. Still, it’s an uptick to keep your eye on because ransomware really sucks. Matt Groening, creator of Futurama and The Simpsons , announced a new Futurama game. The game is called Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow. The game was written and produced by series regulars David Cohen and Matt Groening while the developer will be TinyCo. The bad news is that it’ll be a free to play game like other show-based titles. We don’t have a release date yet, but you can pre-register now if you want. Instagram received a rather large update this week . The service now lets you share multiple photos in a single post. People using the social network no longer have to pick the best of their photos. They can now just upload everything if they want to under a single post. It may not seem like much. However, this fundamentally changes how people use the platform. The update is rolling out right now so prepare to see those multi-photo posts very soon. Word around the digital grapevine is that YouTube is doing away with 30-second unskippable ads. In exchange, the service is going to be using more frequent six-second unskippable ads. This sounds pretty bogus, but six seconds isn’t nearly as annoying as 30. This is likely in response to Facebook focusing more on video. YouTube wants to make fewer people angry and keep them around longer. It’s really not that bad.

It features point-and-click mechanics to solve puzzles and progress through the story line. You play as a guy who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Your job will be to survive. It features some creepy atmospheric elements, dark themes, and other classic horror stuff. It's a 2D game and the mechanics are simple enough. Perhaps the best part is that it's cheap and it has no in-app purchases. It's a rare horror game that isn't half bad. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Bard Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Bard is a fun little app that cuts up videos. The way it works is you choose from a list of videos. You'll then be provided the script word for word. You choose which words you want and then the app cuts the video to make the video say those things. The possibilities are limitless although the app definitely isn't perfect at doing it. It's likely something you'll download, play with for a few weeks, and then uninstall. Still, it'll be a fun couple of weeks. At the very least, the app is free with no in-app purchases. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Link Twin Price: $1.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Link Twin is another one of those indie puzzle games that people seem love so much. The game revolves around a set of twins. Your goal is to use the environment to move the twins along with various objects around to achieve the objective. It features over 100 levels, ten mechanics, and five worlds for you to play through. It has that indie developer look and feel to it so it's nothing you haven't seen before. The game costs $1.99 and it has no in-app purchases. That means there are no paywalls to get stuck behind. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY NBA VR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY NBA VR is a Daydream-only application for basketball fans. It won't let you watch live games. At least we don't think it does. However, it does let you watch highlights, interviews, and other NBA generated video content. It gives you a lounge kind of area to chill in while you watch all of this stuff go down. It's basically a glorified highlight and interview app, but it's one that works on Google Daydream. At the very least, it's free to download and check out. It's a must-try for NBA fans who also have Google Daydream. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Island Delta Price: $2.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Island Delta is the latest game out of Noodlecake Studios. This is a third person action platformer. You'll be running around, shooting stuff, solving puzzles, defeating bad guys, and the whole nine yards apparently. It comes complete with a full story, 30 levels, hidden areas, bonus levels, and more. The game looks pretty good and plays well enough on most devices. It's also a pay-once game with no in-app purchases or advertisements. It's pretty good and worth checking out. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Thanks for reading!
