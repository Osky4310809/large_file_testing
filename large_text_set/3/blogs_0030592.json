With their run-in, they need to be \nMamadou Sakho has helped Crystal Palace win their last three games without conceding a goal. With 10 tough fixtures to come, they need him to keep it up \nBy Martin Laurence for WhoScored? , part of the Guardian Sport Network     13.54 BST Last modified on   14.06 BST \nWhat a difference a month makes . When Crystal Palace travelled to Middlesbrough at the end of February, they were three points adrift of their opponents and above bottom club Sunderland by virtue of goal difference alone. Three games, three clean sheets and three wins later, Sam Allardyce’s men are now out of the relegation zone, six points clear of Middlesbrough and eight in front of Sunderland. However, a look at their run-in suggests they may need every one of those points come the end of the season. \nPalace have to face each of last season’s top eight in their remaining 10 games. Four of their five remaining away matches are at Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United – and the other is at Southampton, where Palace lost 4-1 last May. Palace are far from safe, sitting just four points above the relegation zone, but they have improved in recent weeks – thanks in large part to a January signing who is often under-appreciated. \nGiven that he hadn’t played a competitive game of football in over nine months, it was hardly surprising that Allardyce was cautious about introducing Mamadou Sakho into his starting XI. The 27-year-old, who arrived on loan from Liverpool on deadline day with little fanfare, was left on the bench for defeats against Sunderland and Stoke. A two-week break then gave the Frenchman time to get up to speed and convince the manager that he was ready to help remedy Palace’s defensive woes. Mamadou Sakho puts drug test and Klopp behind him at Crystal Palace Read more \nThe Palace defence looked solid before the start of the season, particularly at centre-back, where James Tomkins had arrived to provide competition for Damien Delaney and Scott Dann. Dann, who became the new club captain in the summer, had been one of the club’s strongest and most consistent performers since their return to the top flight but he has endured a disappointing campaign. Delaney made way for Tomkins earlier in the season and now Dann has been the replaced too, with Sakho coming in and making the team look far more assured at the back. \nAssurance is a word you might not associate with Sakho, but he’s a far better defender than many people think. His lumbering style and apparent lack of technique make him one of those players who is difficult comprehend. His demeanour can make him look panicked in possession and unsure of what to do, but that’s not the case at all. \nSakho is an exceptional distributor from the back. His pass accuracy of 82.1% has dropped from the previous campaign (87.9%) but that’s a reflection of the different styles employed by Liverpool and Palace. When you compare his distribution to Tomkins (77.5% pass accuracy), Dann (74.2%) and Delaney (70.9%), it’s clear that he has instilled a sense of calm to the defence. \nNevertheless, it’s his assumed flaws that go some way to making Sakho the popular player that he is among supporters, if not previous managers. The way he careered out of defence after stealing the ball against West Brom before realising he had no options, passing to the referee and then slide-tackling him might not have been encouraging, but it was a hilarious episode that he ultimately recovered. \nIn that sense he is similar to Kolo Touré, who is also seen as a figure of fun even though he was among the Premier League’s strongest centre-backs in his prime. At 27 Sakho should be approaching his best years and, while a spell out of the game after his fallout with Jürgen Klopp was far from ideal, early signs suggest that it hasn’t held him back. Infographic: WhoScored \nIt’s easy to forget that he has played 151 times for Paris Saint-Germaina and won 28 caps for France. He would have been a shoo-in for their squad at Euro 2016 – if not a starter – were it not for an unsubstantiated drugs ban . His commanding physical presence at the back has instantly improved Palace’s chances of survival and, if they do beat the drop, Allardyce will undoubtedly be keen to make this loan deal permanent. Sakho’s averages of 3.3 aerial duels and eight clearances per game for Palace are well clear of the club’s alternatives at centre-back and only Wilfried Zaha has earned a higher rating for the club this season (7.32). \nLiverpool’s defence continues to be their weakness and Palace fans are already keen to see Sakho stay at Selhurst Park, which speaks volumes of an underestimated defender whose presence would improve the fortunes of both sides. If Palace avoid relegation, they’ll likely owe a great deal to the Frenchman regardless of where his future may lie. \n• Follow Martin Laurence on Twitter Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:20:09.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
