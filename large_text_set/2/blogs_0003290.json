This also holds true for the currently airing Masamune-kun's Revenge – well, only partially. While the show’s backgrounds are certainly not among the most breathtaking ones of the season (which is perfectly fine for a rom-com anime), they’re also not exactly faithful to their real-world counterparts. In other words, Masamune-kun’s Revenge ’s  backgrounds often deviate from their real-world models, resulting in a bunch of misplaced or even omitted real-world buildings, making it hard to recreate a lot of these shots in real life. This obviously does not take anything away from the show itself, which is an entertaining and surprisingly interesting new entry to one of my favorite genres – it just means that it’s a bit harder for me to track down these locations. \n\nMasamune-kun’s Revenge takes place in Mitaka most of the time, a city located in the western part of the Tokyo Metropolis. However, the show’s school is actually modeled after a high school in Kochi, the capital of the identically named prefecture in the south of the island of Shikoku. But let’s get to the comparison shots!\n \n*All images were taken with GOOGLE STREET VIEW \n \n\n \nLike I just mentioned, the school in Masamune-kun’s Revenge is modeled after a high school in Kochi, namely Kochi Ozu High School. There actually seems to be some kind of collaboration going on between the school and the anime, as the school and a certain Kochi Film Commission are both listed in the ending credits . I was not able to ascertain the reason behind this decision, but my best guess would be that somebody at studio Silver Link just liked the school’s unique look. It’s also worth noting that the locations in the manga look nothing like the ones in the anime. \n \n\n\n \nThis image is a good example of what I was talking about before. Masamune is on his way to school here, but you’ll notice quite a few differences between the anime and the real-world image. Not only did the anime include a non-existent wall, it also left out that little canal to the left. However, if you look at the orange street-mirror to the left, and also the road sign in the top right corner, it’s evident that this is in fact the right spot. There’ll be a lot more of those differences between the anime backgrounds and their real-world counterparts, so keep an eye on those. \n \n\n\n \nThe coffee shop Aki and her servant, Yoshino, visit in the first episode is modeled after a Komeda’s Coffee, a large coffee shop chain with over 600 locations all over Japan. This specific coffee shop is located in Mitaka. \n \n\n \nAki is keen on keeping up her reputation in front of her fellow schoolmates, and therefore restrained herself from eating too much at the café. Needless to say, a few coffee shop snacks won’t satisfy her healthy appetite, so she sends out Yoshino to get her something from a nearby bakery. However, the real-world bakery, which is based on the Sam & Tom bakery in Mitaka, is anything but close by. It would have taken Yoshino at least half an hour in the real world to get from the coffee shop to the bakery,…\n \n\n \n… and even longer to get to the small Murasaki Bridge here. As you can see, all of these locations are scattered somewhere around Mitaka, they’re just not as close to each other as the anime makes them out to be. This bridge also sets the stage for Masamune to finally start carrying out his revenge plan.\n \n\n\n \nA small playground in Inokashira Park, which is also where the Ghibli Museum is located.\n \nCC by  DAJF \n \nIn the third episode, Masamune’s plan is already in full swing, and he finally gets to go on a date with Aki. Masamune has clearly done his homework, as he chose one of the best dating spots in the country, the Minato Mirai 21 area in Yokohama. He gets off at Sakuragicho Station, which is close to the Kishamichi Promenade. \n \n\n \nThe Kishamichi Promenade is a beautiful 500-meter long boardwalk offering spectacular views of Yokohama’s skyscrapers. \n \n\n \nHe meets up with Aki in front of the giant Yokohama World Porters shopping mall.\n \n\n \nYou can see the outline of the The InterContinental Yokohama Grand to the right; however, the building to the left does not exist. There were a couple of nonexistent and misplaced buildings in this episode, the anime even completely left out the Yokohama Cosmo World amusement park in one instance. \n \n\n \nAki and Masamune later take their date to the Marine & Walk, an open-air mall. \n \nWD \n \nThis image is again a bit odd, and I’m not even talking about the cruel princess being considerate for a change, it’s the background. While that’s clearly the Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse in the back, it’s not possible to replicate this specific shot in real life, as there is no bench and hedge that would allow for a photo of the Red Brick Warehouse at this angle. \n \n\n\n \nA different playground in Inokashira Park.\n \n\n\n \nMurasaki Bridge again.\n \n\n \nStreet through Inokashira Park. \n \n\n \nMasamune-kun’s Revenge is a rom-com after all, so the typical ‘love interest crosses street without checking traffic just to be heroically saved by the main character’ trope is a given. \n \n\n \nWill we finally get to see a kiss next episode? \n \n\n\n\n \nThe mysterious Neko is overlooking the Inokashira Pond in this image from the show’s ending theme.\n \nWhat are your thoughts about Masamune-kun’s Revenge so far, and which nickname would the cruel princess assign you?
