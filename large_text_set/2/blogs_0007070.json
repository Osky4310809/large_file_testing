They focused on male and female doctors in the same healthcare and hospital systems, and adjusted for variables like physician age, medical training, and years of experience. \nThe difference was especially significant with some conditions, including pneumonia, sepsis, congestive heart failure , chronic pulmonary disease , urinary tract infections, acute kidney failure, arrhythmia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. \nAlthough the study was done on elderly patients, the results would likely hold true for younger folks, too, study researcher Ashish Jha, MD, told WGBH News . \nSo what are women doctors doing that male doctors might not? \nResearchers noted that women physicians are more likely to adhere to clinical guidelines, provide preventive care more often, and use more patient-centered communication than male doctors. \nHowever, the study stopped short at definitively saying that there was something about medical care from females that caused decreased mortality—just that the outcomes seemed linked to physician gender, with women having the edge when it comes to lower mortality and fewer readmissions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:45:31.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
