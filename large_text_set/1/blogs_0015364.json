Lamar Alexander, the committee’s Republican chairman, pushed the hearing to an atypical 5 p.m. start time, and allowed each member only one round of five-minute questions. According to said The Washington Post, other committees have allowed 10-minute periods for questioning Trump nominees and two of them—Rex Tillerson, for secretary of state, and Jeff Sessions, for attorney general—were subjected to three rounds of questioning per senator. \nAlexander’s decision limit questioning of DeVos and his conduct of the hearing before DeVos was cleared by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics were assailed by angry committee Democrats throughout the evening session. \nDeVos and her family have been major donors to the GOP, giving an estimated $818,000 to 20 current Republican senators during the 2014 and 2016 election cycles, said the Post . Five senators who received donations from DeVos’ family sit on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \nWhile committee Republicans like Maine Sen. Susan Collins chided the Democrats’ approach to DeVos during the hearing, some of the nominee’s answers became viral moments. Here are the stand-outs. \nDeVos says schools need guns in case of grizzly bear attacks. \nWhen asked by Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy (D) if guns had any place in or around schools, DeVos said that decision should be “best left to locales and states.” \nPushed further to make a definitive statement, DeVos brought up a Wyoming elementary school that put a fence in place to protect children, saying, “I think probably there, I would imagine that there’s probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies.” \nNaturally, the Internet had something to say. Wrote one Twitter user, “We need a Secretary of Education that will work hard to end all of the grizzly bear on bear crime in schools. O BETSY DEVOS!” We need a Secretary of Education that will work hard to end all of the grizzly bear on bear crime in schools. \nO BETSY DEVOS! \n— Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 18, 2017 Someone kindly explain to Betsy DeVos it's the right to bear arms, not arm bears. The kids are safe. \n— samantha ronson (@samantharonson) January 18, 2017 I don't understand Betsy DeVos's logic on grizzlies. If bear attacks are bad, can't we solve that with more bears? Good guys with bears? \n— Alexandra Erin (@alexandraerin) January 18, 2017 \nDeVos has no personal experience with using federal student loans. \nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D) used her allotted five minutes to press DeVos on higher education and the Education Department’s massive student loan program, teasing out of DeVos that she has no experience with student loans and has never managed or overseen a billion or trillion dollar loan program. \n“Have you ever taken out a student loan from the federal government to pay for college?” Warren asked, to which DeVos replied, “I have not.” \nProdded Warren, “Have any of your children had to borrow money to pay for college?” \nReplied DeVos, “They have been fortunate not to.” \nDeVos also said she had “no personal experience” with federal Pell Grants, which are awarded to undergraduate students dependent on financial need, cost of attendance and more. \nWarren asked DeVos about Trump’s $25 million settlement to Trump University students, questioning if the nominee would protect “waste, fraud and abuse” at similar for-profit colleges. \n“Will you commit to enforcing these rules to ensure that no career college receives federal funds unless they can prove that they are actually preparing their students for gainful employment and not cheating them?” Warren further prodded. \nDeVos said she would not commit to enforcing the rule, but instead would “review” it. Retorted Warren, “If you cannot commit to use the tools that are already available to you in the Department of Education, then I don’t see how you can be the secretary of education.” Betsy DeVos has ZERO experience in k12 public schooling, nor with federal student aid, nor with managing major finances. You guys. WHY?!?!!! \n— Abbey Chiavario (@abbeychiavario) January 18, 2017 This AM Betsy DeVos woke up and looked up Pell Grants on Wikipedia. \n\"Feh!\" she exclaimed and turned on an episode of 700 club from her DVR. \n— Jeremy Newberger (@jeremynewberger) January 18, 2017 \nDeVos says states should make decisions about special-education requirements. \nDuring questioning by Virginia senator and 2016 vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine (D), DeVos confirmed that she’s never attended a public K-12 school, nor have her children. She’s also never taught at a public school. \nDeVos also struggled to answer Kaine’s questions about the federal civil rights laws that requires states to use federal funding to provide special services to children with disabilities. \nRELATED VIDEO: Trump Denies Claims He Employed Prostitutes in Russia: ‘I’m a Germaphobe’ \n“Should all k-12 schools receiving governmental funding be required to meet the requirements of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act?” Kaine asked. In response, DeVos said, “I think that’s an issue that’s best left to the states.” \nLater, according to the Washington Post , New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan (D) asked DeVos if she understood that the aforementioned law was a federal civil rights law. DeVos told Hassan – who, the Post, noted has a disabled son – that she “may have confused it.” \nFurther, DeVos told Kaine only “I support accountability” when asked if she thinks all schools that receive federal funding – whether public, public charter or private – should be held to the same accountability standards. \nWrote CNN’s Ana Navarro in response, “I had high hopes for DeVos. But as a special-needs sister, I cringed at her lack of familiarity (I’m being kind) re IDEA.” Hi! I'm a dad. My son has special needs. Betsy DeVos is willfully ignorant of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. I'm a mad dad \n— Bret Saunders (@Bretontheradio) January 18, 2017 @JohnLeguizamo , I had high hopes for Devos. But as a special-needs sister, I cringed at her lack of familiarity (I'm being kind) re IDEA.😱 https://t.co/BpYnWuWycN \n— Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) January 18, 2017 \nDeVos seems unaware of the difference between student proficiency and student growth. Sen. Al Franken discovers Trump Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos doesn’t know the difference between proficiency and growth. pic.twitter.com/QFQchwHhuc \n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js \n“I would like your views on the relative advantage of doing assessments and using them to measure proficiency or to measure growth,” Minnesota Sen. Al Franken (D) asked DeVos during his time. \nShe answered, “Thank you Senator for that question. I think if i’m understanding your question correctly around proficiency I would also correlate it to competency and mastery so that each student is measure according to the advancement they’re making in each subject area…” \nInterrupting, Franken told DeVos, “Well that’s growth, that’s not proficiency… this is a subject that’s been debated in the education community for years… it surprises me that you don’t know this issue.” \nFranken posted to Facebook late Tuesday night this statement: “Earlier this evening, I questioned Betsy DeVos, President-elect Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Education, and was deeply troubled by the fact that she seemed unfamiliar with some of the most basic issues in education today.” \n“Ms. DeVos repeatedly refused to answer questions, let alone offer specifics. That was not what the American people needed to hear. They deserved to see her demonstrate that she understands and can successfully address the profoundly difficult challenges ordinary families face every day when it comes to education: things like making sure their kids are prepared for the 21st century economy, addressing student loan debt, and ensuring kids feel safe in school.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T21:20:57.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
