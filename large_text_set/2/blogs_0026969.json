Watch as the new Williams takes to the track in Barcelona on day one of the first test \n\"The car's very complex, there's not much room for error and just getting to grips with the car. \n\"But not a dent to the confidence. I was very happy in the car in the few laps I did.\" \nStroll was on the sixth lap of his second stint before spinning, an incident Williams described as \"innocuous\". \n\"It was low grip and I just lost the car,\" the Canadian explained. \"Went through the gravel, a little spin, drove it back to the garage and apparently it broke a little winglet on the front wing. We only have one, so it ended our day. \nVOTE: 2017's best-looking car \n\"A little bit unfortunate but it is what it is. Things happen in testing like this at the beginning so going to get back, keep the head down and keep pushing from there.\" \nStroll returns to the FW40 for Thursday's final day, with veteran team-mate Felipe Massa back in the car on Wednesday. Williams' pre-season programme had begun in more encouraging fashion when the Brazilian completed over 100 laps on Day One. \nKeep up to speed with all the latest news, pictures and video from every day of F1 testing via the daily live blog on the Sky Sports website and mobile apps.
