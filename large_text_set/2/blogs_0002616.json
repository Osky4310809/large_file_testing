But if you look at the table, they were one of the favourites for the title six or eight weeks ago and now there is a big question mark whether they will finish in the top four. \nAguero drops major Man City exit hint \n\"In recent years whenever the chips have been down the team have failed and that hasn't changed with Klopp. \n\"Whether Klopp can change it with this team, or another, I am not sure, but something has to change because the way the team is going in recent years is not good enough.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T22:37:35.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
