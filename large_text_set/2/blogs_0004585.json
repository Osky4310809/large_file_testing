From Tampa to Miami to Orlando , businesses that are historic and cultural institutions are being hurt by these sweeping regulations, and I’m proud to once again partner with Bill Nelson in standing up for Florida workers.” \nDuring an October visit to J.C. Newman Cigar Company in Tampa , Rubio recalled the time he spent as a child sitting on the porch with his grandfather, who smoked cigars and once worked in a cigar factory in Cuba, where he would keep the workers entertained by reading to them. \nCosponsors of the bill include Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Steve Daines (R-MT), Bob Casey (D-PA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), John Boozman (R-AR), Jon Tester (D-MT), Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Dean Heller (R-NV).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:52:20.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
