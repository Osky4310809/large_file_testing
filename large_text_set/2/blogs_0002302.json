Our reporters answer the question that plagued both England legends' careers \nSturridge was training ahead of Liverpool's Premier League trip to the KC Stadium to face Hull on Saturday, but the out-of-sorts striker knows he is running out of time to change his manager's mind. \nWriting for the Echo , former Reds midfielder Molby said: \"I’d have liked us to have made a signing in January. Sometimes you’re just treading water a little bit and you need something to kick-start your season again. We didn’t but now we go into a period of 15 games in 15 weeks which should suit us. \n\"In terms of the squad Jurgen Klopp’s shown a lot of patience but I think it’s important to him.

Klopp will never be a chequebook manager but there will be some new players coming in that's for sure. \n\"As much as you want the young players to be involved, only exceptional young players get in the first team and never come out again and the ones we’ve got are still probably 18 months to two years away from being able to challenge for the first team.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:05:16.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
