This follows on the opening of the order books for the car , which began on February 1. \nThe refreshed B-segment sedan receives a number of tweaks inside and out, plus added kit. Exterior revisions include redesigned headlights, which are now joined together by a new chrome bar inspired by the new Civic , as well as a reworked grille, which features a new honeycomb mesh and a chrome strip. \nElsewhere, the front and rear bumpers have been given a new profile, and the top-spec V grade variant now features LED headlights and fog lights as well as new two-tone 16-inch alloy wheels. The model also gets LED tail lights and a ducktail spoiler with an integrated LED brake light. \nStill a bit to go before the car is officially launched here, so Honda Malaysia isn’t divulging everything about the car just yet. There’s no word of what changes to expect with the interior, but as previously mentioned, we should get the darker gunmetal trim, redesigned seat fabric (with the Civic’s centre stripe) and LED map/room lights as seen on Thai models. \nAll City variants now feature keyless entry and push-button start, while the V grade adds on a multi-angle reverse camera. Safety-wise, all models now come with Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), hill start assist and an emergency stop signal, with the V grade getting six airbags. \nAs for powertrain and drivetrain, the City facelift retains the 1.5 litre i-VTEC four-cylinder engine, mated to an Earth Dreams CVT transmission. No output numbers have been revealed as yet, but expect these to remain at 120 PS and 145 Nm as seen currently. At the event, it was revealed that the model lineup will also be streamlined from four variants (Grade S, S+, E and V) to three (S, E and V).
