The Make America Great Again is now in gold emblazoned across the front and there's a shamrock on the back of them. \nSo far, so good. \nOr not. Trump's hats have quite a glaring mistake - that isn't a shamrock. \nThis is a four-leafed clover. \nA shamrock is the real symbol of Ireland and has three leaves. Of course, people spotted it straight away... It was fairly obvious... The whole of Ireland collectively sighs... There's even a shirt for it. \nTo recap, for those at the back of the class.... This is a shamrock ...this is a shamrock (Photo: EyeEm) This is a four-leaf clover... ...four leaf clover (take a look Trump) (Photo: Science Photo Library RM) \nNow where's that facepalm emoji.
