Cripplingly narcissistic. Incapable of telling the truth. Incapable of letting others tell the truth either. \nDonald Trump can't possibly be a Russian agent, because a Russian agent wouldn't be so gobsmackingly obvious about it . President-elect Donald Trump, a harsh critic of U.S. intelligence agencies, is working with top advisers on a plan that would restructure and pare back the nation’s top spy agency, people familiar with the planning said, prompted by a belief that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has become bloated and politicized. [...] \nOne of the people familiar with Mr. Trump’s planning said advisers also are working on a plan to restructure the Central Intelligence Agency, cutting back on staffing at its Virginia headquarters and pushing more people out into field posts around the world. The CIA declined to comment on the plan. \nWhile one can certainly debate many reforms to America’s intelligence operations, the Journal's source confirms that Donald Trump’s reason is because he believes those agencies are \"completely politicized\"—and it comes in the midst of an all-out Twitter war by the insulter-in-chief against the American intelligence community over their reported conclusion that Russian officials were behind hacks intended to interfere in the U.S. election. (Trump, for his part, has based his skepticism of those intelligence community conclusions on the supposed computer expertise of his 10 year old son , which is not at all insane or the ravings of a lunatic mind.) So as a result of his skepticism, he's going to cut down those agencies and \"restructure\" them to be more to his liking. \nOh—and the \"more to his liking\" part is also completely freaking insane , by the way. Among those helping lead Mr. Trump’s plan to restructure the intelligence agencies is his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who had served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency until he was pushed out by DNI James Clapper and others in 2013. \nThat would be the Michael Flynn who was himself accused of discouraging intelligence that went against his own beliefs, during his tenure, and who now populates both Twitter and Donald Trump’s own head with conspiracy theories. Putting Michael Flynn in charge of molding the intelligence community to better fit Trump's incompetent and uninformed beliefs is ... well, completely freaking insane. \nSo Donald Trump is about to carve up American intelligence agencies because he's so unwilling to concede Russian influence in his election—or even concede that they might know more than his 10 year old son—that he believes it requires retribution. He believes they are \"politicized\" simply because he's angry about what they've been telling him. \nThis is insane. This is utterly loony. This man is completely unfit for office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T02:27:50.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
