Or, are you that person who constantly tries to justify your point of view when someone argues with you? At the same time, have you met someone who could remain calm and collected while dealing with a conflict or chaos? Do you ever wonder how they could maintain composure without becoming agitated or irritated? Here are four ways that emotionally intelligent people handle conversations in social situations.\nEveryone receives negative feedback sometimes, even those with high emotional intelligence. Where they differ is that emotionally intelligent people do not feel attacked emotionally, and they do not respond with a defensive “No, I’m not” immediately. Rather, they process their emotions fully and understand the point of view of the other side.\nEveryone makes mistakes, but is everyone willing to admit what they did wrong? Emotionally intelligent people are not afraid to admit their own limitations and weaknesses, so they do not have a hard time apologizing. They are transparent with their weak points and have a real motivation to better themselves with the help of others.\nEveryone encounters stubborn and annoying people, but how do emotionally intelligent people stay patient while everyone else is about to flip the table over? They are good at understanding and managing their emotions without having an emotional outburst. At the same time, they understand the emotional drives of other people, which leads to the last point – emotionally intelligent people are good at managing other people’s emotions and validating them.\nHaving someone who is empathetic towards you certainly makes you feel important and valued. Even when a disagreement arises, emotionally intelligent people make others more willing to compromise because they feel appreciated and accepted by those with high EQ.\nEmotionally intelligent people are just like us, and they face the same challenges and situations, but what makes them different is their approach. So, why not try to start small by taking a deep breath before handling conversations and conflicts?\nFeatured photo credit: Markus Spiske via imcreator.com \nThe post Here’s How Emotionally Intelligent People Handle Conversations appeared first on Lifehack .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:01:41.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
