The Reds struggled against the Premier League's worst away side for long spells, although goals from Georginio Wijnaldum and Can eventually overturned Ashley Barnes' opener in a 2-1 win. The German international toiled for much of the game although performed well after his second-half effort. Even so, speaking on Sky Sports (h/t Tom Bassam of the MailOnline) after the game, Carragher admitted he doesn't quite see where Can fits in: \nCan's big problem is that I don't think he's a versatile player but he's played in four or five positions for Liverpool. \nThe only position I think he can play is the one he played [against Burnley], the sitting midfielder, because he needs legs around him. [Klopp] is playing Jordan Henderson ahead of him. The Anfield stalwart continued: \"Now, he's got a contract situation at the moment, [Can]. Is he going to sign it? Is he not? I think he may have 12 months at the end of the season. \"So there is a good chance he may not be here next season. I don't see, when the first XI is picked, where else he can play except that role. That role is for the captain Jordan Henderson, who I can see how much he is missed in the last three or four games he's been out.\" Matthew Lewis/Getty Images According to Bassam, Can is not close to signing a contract extension as things stand, with the player said to be requesting an improvement on his current weekly salary of Â£50,000. The Germany international's deal expires at the end of the 2017-18 campaign. As noted by Ste Hoare of Fresh Press UK, the game against Burnley epitomised the inconsistency that has riddled the 23-year-old's game: Ste Hoare @stehoare 3/12/2017, 5:17:51 PM There's definitely talent to harness when it comes to Can. On the ball he's composed, he has a sharp turn of pace and he also has the physicality to bustle opposition players off the ball. Last season he showcased those attributes frequently, too, picking up the club's Young Player of the Year gong. However, this season has seen the German slip down the pecking order. Liverpool have been at their best with a midfield trio of Wijnaldum, Henderson and Adam Lallana, all players who move the ball quickly and are fluid in their movement in the middle third. Can celebrates his winning goal against Burnley. Michael Regan/Getty Images That's not Can's game. As Carragher noted, while he's adaptable, he's not a player who interchanges well, nor is he a midfielder who moves the ball quickly. He seems to cherish every little touch of it. As a result, in recent weeks his form has been a up and down. Dominic King of the Daily Mail was disappointed with his efforts before scoring against Burnley: Dominic King @DominicKing_DM Another one of those games from Emre Can. He should be stamping his presence all over this, not fluttering on the edges. 3/12/2017, 4:42:26 PM Although Can doesn't seem totally attuned to the direct and incisive style of football manager Jurgen Klopp wants to play, there is still time for him to learn. He's got the right attitude, doesn't hide in matches and, for all the criticism, is still a young player. As such, he's worth investing in. Given his struggles and his contract situation, transfer rumours will continue to surface between now and the end of the campaign. With Henderson sidelined with injury for a while yet, there's a chance for Can to show he's worthy of a new long-term contract.
