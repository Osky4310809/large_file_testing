Mum's desperate pleas as newborn died after string of hospital blunders Kaleigh Elwell begged midwives \"please save my baby\" but baby Cohen died just hours later after after suffering multi-organ failure and brain damage Share Raleigh Elwell lost her baby son Cohen (Photo: Birmingham Mail) Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nA mum has spoken of a heartbreak after her baby died at two days old with severe brain damage following a series of hospital blunders. \nCohen Mark Joseph Cross was born following an emergency Caesarian at Birmingham Women’s Hospital after mum Kaleigh Elwell was admitted at 35 weeks with bleeding. \nHe died just 48 hours later after suffering multi-organ failure and brain damage, caused by lack of oxygen. \nThe Birmingham Mail reports the hospital later admitted failures including staff shortages and delays in identifying the emergency \n“I was reassured that I was in the best place, but obviously I wasn’t,” said Kaleigh, from Weoley Castle.

It’s heartbreaking. He should be sitting up and smiling. \n“It was the worse thing that I have ever gone through.” \nKaleigh, who has three other children, was admitted to hospital early on October 1 after telephoning to say she had been bleeding. \nThe 29-year-old had already been identified as a high-risk patient after previous early labours with Harry, 12, Sienna, eight and Kaison, three. \nKaleigh was told to come straight to the ward and was monitored over several hours. \nDespite experiencing bleeding and diarrhoea medical staff were content that she was not showing signs of pre-term labour. \n“By the evening I was shaking and had diarrhoea and some vomiting,” said Kaleigh. \n“Later I had a big bleed, which I know now was a placenta abruption, and was told to get back on the bed. It took a while to find a heartbeat. \n“When they finally realised it was an emergency there was a big major rush. I remember saying to the midwife ‘please save my baby’.

I believe that Cohen would be alive today if there had not been a delay. \n“No mother should ever have to face what I have been through and, while nothing can change what has happened, I hope that speaking out about it may ensure that no one else faces the same ordeal in the future. \nSince the tragedy the hospital Trust said that had they had worked to improve training for clinical staff and were working to improve the bleep system. \nA spokesperson for Birmingham Women’s Hospital said: “We would like to offer our sincere and heartfelt condolences to Kaleigh and her family following the tragic death of baby Cohen. \n“We recognise that there were a number of failings in the care we provided upon admission to the ward and the staff involved are devastated about what happened. \n“Important lessons have been learned from this awful incident and we have already delivered enhanced training for clinical staff around better communication and timely escalation, to ensure that any concern about a mother or baby is acted on as quickly as possible.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:20:03.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
