And I’m the guy. I’m the guy that can actually make the offer, and I’m actually making a real offer. We’ll pay you $25 million. We’ll pay Conor $25 million. And then we’ll talk about Pay-Per-View at a certain number. There’s a real offer.”\n. @danawhite makes a REAL OFFER to @FloydMayweather to fight Conor McGregor ( @TheNotoriousMMA ).\nRT if you want to see the fight happen pic.twitter.com/rwm7hV9pd0 \n— Herd w/Colin Cowherd (@TheHerd) January 13, 2017 \n\nFloyd was eventually tracked down by TMZ and was told about Dana’s offer. Floyd seemed pretty insulted. \nWhile Dana’s numbers are insulting he has a point that Conor is just a huge a draw at this point as Mayweather. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:12:37.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
