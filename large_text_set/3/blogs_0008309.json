His rebounding continued to decline from the levels he'd previously reached for the Oklahoma City Thunder , and he failed to stand out in any singular facet of the game. Ibaka was a positive on both ends of the floor for the Magic, but only barely. Since joining the Toronto Raptors, he's been in for a rude awakening. Though his three-point stroke has returned with aplomb, his rebounding has continued trending in the wrong direction, and his ever-growing turnover figures negate much of what he does on offense. Even his defensive positioning has been poor as he adjusts to his new surroundings. During his brief time with his new squad, Ibaka grades out as a negative on both ends in TPA. That's likely to change, but not by enough to overcome his lackluster numbers with the Magic, thereby relegating the Congolese power forward to an honorable omission. Deron Williams , Cleveland Cavaliers Don't fall victim to the hype created by prominent names from the past. Deron Williams may well develop into a solid backup point guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers, but he hasn't done anything in 2016-17 to indicate he's still an above-average player. The relatively solid offensive numbers he produced for the Dallas Mavericks prior to his release were more than negated by his defense. ESPN.com's defensive real plus/minus , for example, lists the 1-guard as the No. 63 stopper at his position, with a score so negative it more than cancels out his offense. Three games into Williams' Cleveland tenure, he's been even worse. Not only does he continue to struggle defensively, but he's also shot just 35 percent from the field and misfired on all six of his three-point attempts. Honorable Mention: Andrew Bogut, Cleveland Cavaliers 3 of 12 Gregory Shamus/Getty Images Andrew Bogut originally ranked No. 8 (projected at minus-1.88 TPA) before suffering a fractured tibia just 58 seconds into his first game with the Cleveland Cavaliers, per Cavs.com's Joe Gabriele . His projection is obviously now irrelevant, as his recovery will be a lengthy process. But if A) he's not released and B) he somehow regains his health for the inevitable postseason run, Bogut could still add value. It's not hard to estimate his impact based on his time with the Dallas Mavericks. Age and prior injuries had prevented Bogut from thriving as an efficient, low-volume scorer who excelled as a rim-runner. He knocked down just 46.9 percent of his field-goal attempts before leaving Dallas behind, and his 1.07 points per possession as a roll man left him in just the 62.6 percentile â€”a far cry from his early-career heydays. But Bogut still maintained value with his interior defense, and that's likely the role he could fill for Cleveland if he returns. LeBron James would inevitably generate a few easy attempts for him around the tin, but it would be his ability to reject shots and protect the rim that could add a new element to the Cavaliers cause. In his first location, the Australian center allowed just 48.6 percent shooting at the rim while facing 5.4 shots per game. Cleveland, meanwhile, hasn't been bad defending the interior, but its production largely comes from weak-side help and players working out of position; Tristan Thompson and Channing Frye have been the closest things to true centers since Chris Andersen's release. If he could heal quickly to protect the hoop, set tough screens and pick up easy points every so often, Bogut would add to the Cavaliers' veteran-laden bench. 9.
