What is the dark web? \nT he child, who was not named under German privacy laws, had been stabbed to death. He is believed to have been a neighbour of the killer in the west German town of Herne. \nThe suspect is a German national with no immigration background, and the killing is not believed to be terror-related. \nThe “dark web” includes sites known for violent and child pornography, and is frequented by paedophile groups. It is also used for illicit activities such as illegal gun sales. \nDetails of the video posted by Hesse have not been officially released, and it is not clear if it included images of the killing. \nAccording to a highly disturbing unconfirmed account in the German press, Hesse posted in a “dark web” chat room on Monday evening that he was heavily drunk on red wine and planned to do “something rotten”. \nHe did not post for a further 31 minutes, then he returned to boast of the murder and posted an image of himself grinning and holding a blood-stained knife. He threatened that he would commit a second murder. \nA n intense manhunt was underway on Tuesday, with police helicopters and sniffer dogs searching for Hesse and additional police officers drafted in from neighbouring areas. \nH esse is unemployed and has no criminal history, and police described him as “something of an outsider”. \n“He is generally a reserved and rather timid type. However, he should on no account be approached,” Volker Schütte, a police spokesman, told Bild newspaper. \nHesse is around 5 ft 9 ins tall and slightly built. But is a martial arts enthusiast and police warned he could be armed. \n“Since it cannot be ruled out that the suspect poses a risk to the public, he is not be approached. Anyone who encounters him should immediately contact the police,” they said in a statement.
