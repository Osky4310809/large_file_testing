But we're not talking about the clubs. \nRather, our focus here is on the men between the sticks for the two sides: Iker Casillas and Gianluigi Buffon. \nAs the game came to an end, the two legendary stoppers embraced on the pitch knowing that, at the ages of 35 and 39 respectively, this would be one of the last battles against one another - with the second-leg perhaps being the final duel. (Photo: REUTERS) \nBut this picture was more than just two legends sharing a moment. What we saw, in fact, was the embodiment of: 265 Champions League appearances (Photo: Angel Martinez) \nA huge total, made up of Casillas' 163 games and Buffon's 102 appearances in the competition. 97 Champions League clean sheets (Photo: Christof Koepsel) \nAn equally as impressive number, Casillas has 54 shutouts to his name, compared to Buffon's 43 - remarkably close given the fewer number of games. 2 World Cups (Photo: Getty Images) \nBuffon was the first of the two to win football's ultimate prize with Italy's penalty shootout victory over France in 2006, while Casillas took it off his hands when Spain edged past the Netherlands. 12 domestic league titles (Photo: Getty) \nDespite Juventus being stripped of two league wins, Buffon still has seven Serie A titles to his name - whereas Casillas has topped La Liga come the end of the season five times. 334 international caps \nA mammoth number, the two shot-stopping heroes are amazingly level on 167 international caps each. 10 UEFA Team of the Year inclusions (Photo: Michael Steele) \nIt's fair to say they've pretty much shared this honour between them throughout their careers. \nIt'll sure be sad days when they both call it quits.
