After capping off the first half with an impressive toe-tapping touchdown, Jones came right back with another score â€“ this time from much farther out. \nOn the second play of the Falconsâ€™ opening possession of the second half, Jones took a slant 73 yards for a touchdown, torching LaDarius Gunter and Damarious Randall on his way to the end zone. JULIO JONES IS A BEAST. \n73 yards all the way to the house! ðŸ˜± #GBvsATL #NFLPlayoffs https://t.co/Iau1EnDgVJ \nâ€” NFL (@NFL) January 22, 2017 \nThe reception gave Jones seven catches for 144 yards and two touchdowns, as well as a 31-0 lead for the Falcons. Itâ€™s not his best postseason performance, but heâ€™s coming close to matching it. Against the 49ers in 2012, he caught 11 passes for 182 yards and two touchdowns, though the Falcons lost. \nJones would tack on another 23 yards and become the first receiver to accomplish this feat. Julio Jones is the first player in the Super Bowl Era with 150 receiving yards & 2 TD in multiple conference championship games (also 2012)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:29:30.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
