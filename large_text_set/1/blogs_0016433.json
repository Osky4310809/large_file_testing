PUBLISHED: 16:31,  37, Wed, Jan 18, 2017 GETTY • PA Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt demanded the PM condemn Boris Johnson's comments \nMr Verhofstadt, a firebrand MEP, demanded Prime Minister Theresa May condemn the “deeply unhelpful” remarks by the Foreign Secretary amid a growing row. \nDuring a trade trip to India, Mr Johnson had responded to a reported comment from one of Mr Hollande's aides, who said Britain should not expect a better trading relationship with European countries from outside the EU. \nThe Foreign Secretary said: “If Monsieur Hollande wants to administer punishment beatings to anyone who chooses to escape, rather in the manner of some World War Two movie, then I don't think that's the way forward. \n\"It's not in the interests of our friends or our partners.\" Related articles Merkel shoots back at PM warning and insists EU will NOT be divided \nMr Verhofstadt, described as an ‘arch-federalist’, hit out at Mr Johnson over his Second World War reference. \nThe former Belgian prime minister posted on Twitter: “Yet more abhorrent & deeply unhelpful comments from @BorisJohnson which PM May should condemn.” \nBut Mrs May has stood by the Foreign Secretary and rejected calls for Mr Johnson to apologise. \nThe Prime Minister’s official spokeswoman described his comments as a \"theatrical comparison\" and insisted the Vote Leave figurehead had not been comparing the French president to a Nazi. \nShe dismissed the row as a “hyped-up media report\" and claimed Number 10 was not aware of any complaint from the Elysee Palace. \nThe spokeswoman said: \"He was making a point. He was in no way suggesting that anyone was a Nazi.\" \nShe added: “There is not a Government policy of not mentioning the war.\" Yet more abhorrent & deeply unhelpful comments from Boris Johnson Guy Verhofstadt \nBut Mr Johnson’s comments proved awkward for the Government as they came just hours before fellow Cabinet minister Sajid Javid used a speech at a Holocaust Educational Trust reception to condemn “glib” comparisons. \nThe Communities and Local Government Secretary said: “We have to object when a line is crossed from legitimate debate to smears and abuse. \n“We have to push back when people lazily reach for glib comparisons that belittle what happened… calling those we disagree with ‘Nazis’ or claiming someone’s actions are ‘just like the Holocaust’. \n“Ultimately, we have to be prepared to do that most un-British of things – we have to make a scene. Maybe that’ll be in private. Maybe in the media. Maybe on Twitter.” \nThe Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed to Express.co.uk that Mr Javid’s speech was written before Mr Johnson made his remarks about Mr Hollande.
