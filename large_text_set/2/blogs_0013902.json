I saw about five people. The boys are killing and cutting off people’s heads. There is fear in the community, so people are moving out,” the source said. \nA resident of the area, simply identified as Uche, said he was going to stay with his relatives in Port Harcourt. \nUche said the shooting started on Wednesday night, adding that the rival cultists moved freely in the community, in the absence of security operatives. \nHe also said that residents who had fled their homes were wondering “aimlessly” in neighbouring communities, calling on the government for swift intervention. \nUche said, “There is panic in the community. I don’t know the actual number of people killed, but they have killed more than five people since the incident started. \n“We are calling on the government and security operatives to intervene. Our people are suffering; right now, they are in other communities.” \nSaturday PUNCH learnt that most senior officers of the Rivers State Police Command had gone out of the state due to the burial of the late Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr. Francis Odesanya. \nThe spokesperson for the Command, Mr. Nnamdi Omoni, said he would comment on the situation on Saturday (today). \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:27:29.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
