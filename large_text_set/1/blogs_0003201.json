Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe picture of Pep Guardiola furiously slapping his fist into his palm an hour after the final whistle, told the most poignant story of Manchester City 's loss at Liverpool. \nCity manager Guardiola was animatedly engaged in conversation with his director of football and close ally Txiki Begiristain, and was clearly making an angry point about a lack of aggression in his Blues side. \nHe repeatedly pounded one hand into the other, and then opened his arms wide in exasperated questioning of their approach – which confirmed the admission made by Blues star Yaya Toure after an embarrassing defeat by a superior team. \n“Of course the manager was angry at half-time. When you are losing and Liverpool are the better side, when you are losing like that then it’s not going to be happy at half-time. It was disappointing and we all felt that,” he admitted.

He is a manager who can be angry. We have to sometimes improve and react to situations, so he will be angry for everything is happening.” \nLiverpool dominated the first half, scored a brilliant early goal when Georginio Wijnaldum brilliantly converted Adam Lallana’s cross after a flowing move, and then controlled superbly the inevitable second half fightback. \nClearly, that left the Spanish coach wondering about the mental strength of his team, and their ability to adopt the aggressive, pressing game he employed at Barca and Bayern, and which his rival Jurgen Klopp has humming at Anfield.

You are disappointed, and you want to bounce back. We don’t want to let the gap grow much more between us and Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham. So we have to react. \n“We will use it – we are not going to give up. We will go to the end. \n\"We have to believe we can win the title – and in football, anything is possible.” \nWhile City are clinging on to faint hope, Saturday's game showed Liverpool as the most obvious challenge to Chelsea’s dominance at the head of the table, and Wijnaldum is ready to help fire them there. Wijnaldum's soaring header finished off a sweeping move for the only goal (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nHis headed goal was perfect – an embodiment of desire – even though it was only the second time he's scored this season. \nAt the start of the campaign, after his summer move from Newcastle, the Dutch midfielder insisted he must get into double figures. And even though he’s been playing in a much deeper position, argued that is still possible. \n“This is a different way of playing from my previous club but still I think I will reach that number. I’ll do everything but the most important thing is we win games,” he said. \n“If I can help with my goals even better for me and the team but if I don’t score and play a good game I am still happy. But I still think I can score 10 goals this season.” poll loading Where will Manchester City finish this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T00:53:40.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
