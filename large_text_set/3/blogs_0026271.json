So here are some of our favorite edits from years ago, in the hopes that there are some more coming in the near future. \nWarning: Some of the following videos contain profane language, obscene behavior and bodily harm. They may be offensive to some viewers. 411 Video Magazine \nRemember 411 Video Magazine? They’d come out on VHS tapes and were the first looks at up-and-coming skaters you had heard about or seen in magazines. Well, Margera had lots of parts in them throughout the years. \nAnd this one (issue #7) was the first time anyone outside of the Philadelphia area had really seen the 14-year-old skate … And boy did he skate well. The CKY videos \nThese were really Margera’s bread-and-butter with his crew that featured skating, comedy, music and pranks — so, so many pranks. \nThe start of the “Jackass” revolution began with the CKY videos, but there was also some jaw-dropping skating featured in each of them, as well. “Jump Off A Building” \nMargera’s introduction into the greater skate world, it was an authoritative statement that said he was to be taken seriously as a skater — even if you didn’t take him seriously in any other regard. \nIt also let people know that he would jump off of anything, anywhere, anytime. “One Step Beyond” \nBack in the heyday of Adio’s popularity (and existence), the skate shoe company helped vault Margera alongside of Tony Hawk. \nAnd from there, Margera continued an ascension with Hawk by being included in his many video games and skate tours. “Elementality” \nThis was Margera’s first part with skateboard company Element, who he still has a loose relationship with today. \nMargera mentioned in his interview with Jenkem that more parts with Element and board releases could be in the works in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:07:16.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
