(Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images) \nAs a candidate last January, Trump said he would get rid of gun-free zones if elected because he believes they attract mass shooters. Though he has honored many of his campaign promises since being sworn in 11 days ago, this particular one has not come up. \nThe Daily Caller asked the White House press secretary when the president will move forward with his promise during the briefing Wednesday. \n“I think you’ve seen that the president has been very active in terms of getting executive orders out, and following up on the campaign pledges that he made to the American people, last night being another example of that,” Spicer said. \n“We’re going to continue to move forward with this process and I think we’ll have further updates on where we are with respect to the EO process.” (Photo: Getty Images) \nWhile speaking at a January 2016 rally in Vermont, Trump said he would get rid of gun-free zones. \n“You know what a gun-free zone is to a sicko? That’s bait. ‘Gun-free zone?’ And then they walk in with whatever the hell they’re carrying. I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools — you have to — and on military bases. It gets signed, okay? My first day.” \n“There’s no more gun-free zones.” \nWATCH:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:13:53.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
