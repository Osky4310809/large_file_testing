Arriving like the demented, more theatrical cousin of Drake’s “Hotline Bling,” Big Sean has just shared a hilarious visual for his brand new single “Moves.” Watch it above.\nThe video sees Big Sean dancing (and at times profusely gyrating) his way through minimal, multi-colored backdrops. He is then joined by a troupe of scantily-clad women who proceed to array themselves in the kind of large-scale choreography usually found in the glitzy Technicolor musicals of Old Hollywood numbers, if those musicals were able to show more bare asses, that is.\n“Moves” is the latest video from Big Sean, who has also recently shared a colorful accompaniment to surprise new single “ Bounce Back .” Both of these new singles are set to appear on his recently-announced album I Decided , which is set to drop on February 3.\nRevisit the video for “Bounce Back” below.\n\nIn other music video news, Major Lazer has shared a music video for their joint single with Showtek, titled “Believer.” Watch it right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T12:14:48.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
