One could even say that the mass retailer's makeup, skin-care, and hair-care offerings are beginning to rival collections found at big-name beauty stores like, Sephora and Ulta. Perhaps it all started with Target's collaboration with green beauty brand Beautycounter , which hit shelves last fall. Or the growth could due to the more recent drop of Lucy Hale 's hairstylist Kristin Ess's super-luxe new hair-care line . Either way, Target knows what it's doing. And now, just days after announcing a special collection of Korean beauty products curated by Peach & Lily 's founder, Alicia Yoon , Target is continuing its K-beauty roll by bringing even more Seoul favorites to its mainstream shelves. And this time, it's with Korean beauty brand Missha, which, if you're at all familiar with, is best known for its snail gel-based products. (Sounds gross, but don't knock it 'till you try it.) Related Skin Dermatologist Tips on How to Get Rid of Blackheads Call it an under-the-radar drop, but Target recently welcomed Missha onto its virtual shelves, and the selection of products are, as to be expected, good . With 22 skin-care products—a curated collection of moisturizers, serums, and essences—there's a lot to choose from. But the common thread? The brand's hero ingredient, snail gel, which is spiked in a handful of its offerings, including the Allure editor favorite, Missha Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Sleeping Mask , which targets fine lines as you snooze. But if you're not into snail gel, we're also partial to the Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF42 PA+++, a lightweight BB cream that covers redness and protects with a hefty dose of UV protection, thanks to broad spectrum SPF 42. Bottom line: There's probably something in the Missha collection for every skin need.
