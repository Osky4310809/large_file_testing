Her pregnant goddess style started from the top of her head, where she wore a gold-metal floral crown, and extended to her chrome nails. She was so mesmerizing that we left were wondering, is she actually part of the illuminati? \nWe got word that L'Oréal Paris Celebrity makeup artist Sir John did her makeup (as well as her dancers' makeup) for the show. We found out exactly what products were used — get ready because it's a lot of gold! \nWhen it came to contouring, Sir John started with the Infallible Total Cover Concealing & Contour Kit ($17) and then anchored the shading with the Infallible Pro-Contour Palette ($13). It was all blended with the Infallible Blend Artist in Concealer Blender and Contour Blender ($8 each). \nOK, now for the good stuff: highlighter! True Match Liquid Lumi Illuminator in Golden ($13) was applied directly to the high parts of the cheekbones. He followed by pressing Infallible 24HR Eyeshadow in Eternal Sunshine ($8) on top of it \"to create a golden luminescence.\" \nTo get her goddess-like skin, he mixed the illuminator with body lotion and applied all over her body, including legs, arms, and chest. \nBeyoncé's metallic eyes began with the brown matte shades in the Colour Riche La Palette Nude ($20). To create a sculpted smoky eye, apply the deeper brown shades in the crease of the eye and lighter nude shades on the lid. Add the Infallible Paints Eyeshadow in Nude Fishnet ($9) on the middle of the eyelid and \"blend away\" the smoky look and a \"create soft, warm halo-like silhouette.\" \nHe lined her eyes with Infallible Matte Matic Liner in Deep Brown ($9), keeping it very close to the lash line. \nLashes were generously coated with the Voluminous Original Mascara in Black Brown ($7). Brows were filled in using the Brow Stylist Frame + Set ($13) \"as needed\" (which we interpret to mean that Beyoncé likely wakes up with perfectly bold arches). \nWe also learned her manicure shade was OPI Nail Lacquer in Glitzerland ($14). \nYou now have your 2017 Halloween costume ready to go!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:20:22.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
