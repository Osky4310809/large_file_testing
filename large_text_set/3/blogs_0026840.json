The UFC confirmed the bout on Tuesday. \nLatifi is coming off a second-round KO loss to Ryan Bader last September. Before that setback, however, he had won five of his previous six fights, including four by first-round finish. \nâ€” Ilir Latifi (@Latifimma) March 23, 2017 \nHis opponent, Nogueira, is in desperate need of a win after dropping his third loss in his last four fights. The Brazilian, who was also KOed by Bader in his last fight, is eager to prove he still belongs in the light heavyweight top 15. \nUFC in OKC also features a bout between former two-division champion BJ Penn and Dennis Siver as well as a middleweight tilt between Johny Hendricks and Tim Boetsch. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:55:49.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
