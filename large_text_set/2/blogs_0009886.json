Now that the Ninth Circuit has delivered a further blow to the Administration’s Executive Order barring people from seven designated countries from entering the United States, there are two ways forward. Either the Supreme Court quickly agrees to hear an appeal from the Ninth Circuit’s ruling, or else the case goes back for a full trial and then a set of appeals—in which case it's still likely to end up in the Supreme Court later. When it hits the Supreme Court, many observers are expecting a partisan split. That would mean a 4-4 deadlock if the case reaches the Court while it’s still shorthanded, and a 5-4 vote to uphold the order if Judge Neil Gorsuch takes a seat on the Court before the case gets there. And maybe that partisan calculus will turn out to be right. But another outcome is at least as plausible. Given the content and the context of this executive order, it’s easy to imagine at least six Justices pronouncing it unconstitutional—and if Gorsuch participates, seven.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:51:08.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
