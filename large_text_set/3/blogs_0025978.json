What better flavor for ice cream is there than one modeled after everyone’s favorite Harry Potter treat ? I can think of fewer awesome treats than that of butterbeer, and there’s a new ice cream flavor from manufacturer Yuengling that’s meant to capture the very essence of the sweet and savory flavor. Only now you don’t have to go all the way to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter to taste your own butterbeer.\nYuengling Ice Cream’s Butterbeer ice cream is made with half buttercream ice cream, half butterscotch ice cream, and a deliciously sweet butterscotch swirl. Sounds like a sugar rush and a half, but a super tasty one too.\nThe president of Yuengling Ice Cream, David Yuengling, has huge Harry Potter fans for kids, and that’s how this flavor came about:\n“My kids were big Harry Potter fans, and we wanted to do something unique,” he explained.\nFor the uninitiated, butterbeer is supposed to be a type of ale in the Harry Potter books that will absolutely get you drunk if you drink enough. But instead, it’s a non-alcoholic drink you can get in places like the Harry Potter -themed park The Wizarding World of Harry Potter and found online via various recipes.\nThe pint of ice cream is going on sale soon, and it won’t be a special release. It’s actually going to be a regular flavor you can keep purchasing again and again and again for $3.69 – $3.99. So whenever you’re watching your favorite Harry Potter films and have a hankering for some delicious ice cream, you’ll be able to head to the grocery, skim past all the regular, boring flavors, and down some butterbeer ice cream.\nPerhaps the best part is the fact that you can now take official butterbeer ice cream and make butterbeer floats with it. Raise your hand if you’re about to try that.", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/butterbeer-ice-cream_us_58cfd3ffe4b0ec9d29dd5d08"], "published": "2017-03-23T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:04:57.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
