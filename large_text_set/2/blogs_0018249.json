Most Popular By Charles P. Pierce Feb 22, 2017 The Dostoevsky novel in which we have plunged ourselves seems to be getting more tangled and inescapable by the day. As the Beeb reports, there's this dude in Austria who may be visiting one of America's finest courthouses fairly soon. \nMr Firtash was first detained in 2014 in Vienna, but was released after posting a record Austrian bail of €125m (£102m). During the lower court hearing, Mr Firtash's team raised the issue of political motive. At the time, Mr Yanukovych had just indicated he would not sign a deal bringing Ukraine closer to the EU, despite US pressure. The judge said there may have been a US desire to remove his ally, Mr Firtash, from the scene. \"The aim was clearly to prevent [Firtash] from undermining the political interests of the US,\" he wrote. Austrian police insisted the arrest was not related to political events and the US justice department appealed.   Do tell. \nWith the administration of Donald Trump coming to power, the Firtash case now falls into the realm of possible links between the new president's team and Russia. This has already claimed one scalp - national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired after misleading Vice-President Mike Pence about his talks with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. Mr Firtash gained much of his wealth through arrangements with Russian energy giant Gazprom. \nHis business flourished after Mr Yanukovych came to power. A key paid adviser in the president's campaign was Paul Manafort, who later became Mr Trump's election campaign adviser. Mr Manafort and Mr Firtash were linked in a real estate project to redevelop the Drake Hotel site in Manhattan. Mr Yanukovych's opponent, Yulia Tymoshenko, argued this was a money-laundering project to siphon huge amounts of cash out of Ukraine. Mr Firtash denies this, telling Bloomberg that although he was initially interested in the project, he changed his mind. He said he \"always had clean money\" and called Ms Tymoshenko a liar. Last August, the New York Times reported finding ledgers pledging $12.7m (£9.8m) in undisclosed cash payments from the former Russian-backed Ukrainian government to Mr Manafort between 2007 and 2012. Most Popular The only through-line in the campaign and the administration of El Caudillo del Mar-A-Lago is its entanglement with the Russian kleptocrats, in and out of government. It's the only truly consistent element in his rise to power. It's the only thing that's been there, day in and day out, from the moment he came down the golden escalator. Then, as we move further into the dark and stormy night, there's this business with the Russian ambassador to the U.N. From the AP : \nFurther study usually includes toxicology and other screenings, which can take weeks. The case was referred to the medical examiner's office by the hospital, spokeswoman Julie Bolcer said. Vitaly Churkin, who died a day before his 65th birthday, had been Russia's envoy at the United Nations since 2006. He was the longest-serving ambassador on the Security Council, the U.N.'s most powerful body. The medical examiner is responsible for investigating deaths that occur by criminal violence, accident, suicide, suddenly or when the person seemed healthy, or if someone died in any unusual or suspicious manner. Most of the deaths investigated by the office are not suspicious.
