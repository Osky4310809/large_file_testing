Though it is a small film, it generated a lot of buzz courtesy the controversy surronding it. Apart from the unusual love story of a teacher with his student, the title – Haraamkhor did not go down well with a lot of people. They thought of it as an abuse and revolted against the movie. Many people even threatened the makers to change the title. However, in an EXCLUSIVE interview with us Nawazuddin Siddiqui explains to us why Haraamkhor should not be considered as an abusive word… \nTalking to us about the controversy surronding the title, Nawazuddin mentioned, “There are many things that should not (be taken in literal sense). If you take for example, the language we use in our day-to-day life contains such words in various sentences. But that is not an abuse. We say, ‘ Yaar bada Haraamkhor admi hai ‘ or ‘ Mujhe toh lagta tha tu bada Haraamkhor hai .’ That does not make it an abuse. We also say ‘ Mujhe toh lagta tha ye saala bura admi hai .’ We mean to say that he is a bad guy, but we aren’t abusing. Basically it is not an abuse, the word has been taken out from such kind of sentence and used in the title.” \nSo has Nawazuddin himself used Haraamkhor in his real life? The actor revealed, “Obviously, not just me, everyone does. Tell me one person who hasn’t or one person who hasn’t used such kind of words ever in his life?” ALSO READ – Haraamkhor movie review: Nawazuddin Siddiqui excels in the creepiest role of his career \nWhile the discussion about abuses stretched, we even asked Nawazuddin about his first abusive word and when did he use it first?
