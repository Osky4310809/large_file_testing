And it has never slept since.” ~ Jm Storm ~ Whether we call our beloved our twin flame or not doesn’t stop them from being just that. \nOver the past few years, a wave of spiritual ascension has washed over all of humanity, driving us toward higher consciousness. \nAs a catalyst to our own individual journey, many of us have been awoken by our twin flame. \n“Twin flame” is not a new term, nor is it just known in the Western world. Whether we call someone our twin flame or soulmate, or believe the red thread of fate connects us, the important thing is that a soul exists who is a mirror to our own. \nWhile some relationships may end up being false flames as time passes and we can better see the true nature of the relationship, there is a greater chance now than ever of twins meeting and joining in this life. \nThe qualities of a twin flame connection are complicated at best. Usually, we are reincarnated over the course of twelve lifetimes while we learn more about what it means to be human and what purpose we can serve the greater good during our time here. In our last lifetime, we will discover a shared passion for helping others, though there may still be obstacles. \nThere’s a reason why so many twins are joining and—even if the obstacles seem insurmountable—never giving up on one another. \nAs more lightworkers travel to earth, we can see that we are in a time of transition here. We are looking for greater meaning, for a higher level of spirituality, and for our greater purpose. \nThere is no better way to change the world than to join with our twin flame—yet we both have to be ready for that union. \nDuring the past few years, we have met and played the push-and-pull game that twins are famous for. We have been dancing in and out of intimacy, testing the waters to see if it is safe to reveal our true selves to the other. And perhaps most of all, we have been learning a great deal of lessons in a short period of time. \nIt is believed that twins only join in their last lifetime on earth before they ascend into a higher spiritual realm; therefore, it would make sense that, in order for humanity to collectively transform and evolve, a great number of us would have to join with our twin in this lifetime. \nNot all twins are ready to join, and if this is not the lifetime we’re fated to join together, then there isn’t anything to do but absorb the lessons that they have come into our lives to teach us. In many ways, while it’s painful to feel our twin leave our orbit, it’s also comforting to know that we are still right where we are supposed to be in this lifetime—and that we will have another to get it right. \nFor many of us, though, we have done the work in previous lives, and now we are precisely in the place to not only look our twin flame in the eyes, but also to take their hand and join together. Over the course of 2017, many twins will reunite, but this can’t be done until each person achieves the last and perhaps most important stage of soul development: spiritual comprehension. \nWe live in a society that praises the obvious and dismisses the unbelievable. Through that, we have walked away from spirituality, and often religion as well. We have lost the ability to have faith in a being greater than ourselves, and we have forgotten how to pray. \nMany twins continue to not join in this lifetime because they leave out the divine. \nThe essence of twin flames is rooted in the stories of Adam and Eve, Osiris and Isis. The same principle has been written about by Plato, and mentioned in the Old and New Testament, Rabbinical literature and Hindu texts. \nThe divine created twin flame connections, so it also is the only way for each to find one another. \nUntil twins reach the last stage of spiritual comprehension, they will continue to falter and fail to join together. This entire connection is based, to a large degree, on twins being able to assist one another to spiritually develop as individuals. \nThere is no twin flame love without the presence of the divine. \nDuring the first part of this year, we will find ourselves in our twin through first walking into the divine light of love offered by whatever being we choose to pray to. We will learn about what spirituality and religion means for each of us, and we will explore the greater issues of love and what it means to live a human existence while on this planet. \nPerhaps most of all, we will learn how to love the reflection of ourselves that our twin projects. \nNo longer running in fear from what we see, or excusing it away out of a series of coincidences, we will instead find divine faith that what we are feeling is true and that this person came into our lives for a reason. \nWe will begin operating from a higher vibration, which radiates with peace instead of anxiety. \nAnd by the second half of this year, we may just find ourselves kissing our flame good night. “An awakened man looks for an evolved woman as his partner on his life journey because he knows that as their souls merge she will help him to make the shift and become a man of higher awareness.” ~ Daniel Nielsen", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T11:42:08.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
