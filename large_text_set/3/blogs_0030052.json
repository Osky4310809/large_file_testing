A heavy-duty-pickup truck collided with a bus carrying 14 seniors from the First Baptist church in New Braunfels on a highway.\nAuthorities said the driver of the truck is at fault, and the Department of Public Safety along with the Bexar County Medical examiner confirmed that 13 people were killed in the crash.\nThree people survived the crash at first, and were airlifted to University Hospital. One of those survivors died from their injuries later that afternoon.\n\nThe First Baptist church took to Facebook to release two statements:\nALL ACTIVITIES CANCELLED TONIGHT\nChurch Family,\nWe have received word that the bus carrying our senior adults back from their retreat was involved in an accident. We understand there have been some fatalities. All activities for tonight are cancelled, including dinner. The Sanctuary will be open this evening for prayer and support. Please be in prayer for all involved.\nGod bless you,\nPastor Brad and the Staff at FBCNB\nIn another statement, the church wrote:\nOFFICIAL STATEMENT 3/29/17 4:52pm\nAt approximately 2 pm this afternoon, a group of our senior adults were returning home from a 3-day retreat at Alto Frio Baptist Encampment when their vehicle was involved in a head-on collision.\nWe have heard that there have been fatalities, but we have not received any official details from the local authorities.\nWe are ministering to family members to help them deal with this tragedy. Counselors will be on hand at the church tomorrow.\nIf you're a Christian, you can pray for those who lost their loved ones and for the church family.\nSenior Pastor Brad McLean assembled his congregation at the church for prayer and support later that night. He also addressed the media.\n\"As a church, we're waiting for some official news from authorities before we can speak to anything,\" McLean said, adding that the church needs prayer more than anything at this time, and that members of the church gathered to do \"what church families do.\"\n\"They're coming together, they're crying together, praying together and of course there's anxiousness as to who was on the bus and what their condition is,\" McLean said. \"There's just a lot of unknowns.\"\n\"You never know what the day is going to bring,\" McLean added. \"The Lord tells us that we have today, tomorrow is not promised.\"\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T15:47:55.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
