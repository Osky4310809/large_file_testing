So it should come as no surprise that the beverages at Benjamin Bar & Lounge, the cocktail bar inside Trump’s new Washington DC hotel, might induce extreme sticker shock. When the hotel opened, Benjamin’s cocktails were $18 to $21 . That’s quite pricey, but not too uncommon for a fancy cocktail bar in a big city. But now, as the Washingtonian reports , the cheapest drink you’ll find checks in at $24. Ouch. That $24 will get you a “romanesque revival,” made with 24 Revival bourbon, honey, mint, and ginger. Six more drinks run in the $25-to-$29 range, and anyone itching to burn through a serious wad of cash can order “the Benjamin.” An amalgamation of rye, potato, winter wheat vodka, raw oysters, and caviar costs a cool $100. The bar’s menu doesn’t explain how, exactly, the drink is served, or the sources of the oysters and caviar. The beverage list offers an extensive selection of liquor and wine, and big spenders can brag about their bank accounts with several three-figure options. One ounce of Thomas H. Handy Sazerac rye can be had for $175. An ounce of 23-year-old Pappy Van Winkle bourbon is available for $250. Richard Hennessy Cognac is going for $350 per ounce. Right now, Benjamin Bar & Lounge and BLT Steak are the only dining options at the hotel, though a sushi bar is on the way . Original plans called for big-name restaurants from celebrity chefs José Andrés and Geoffrey Zakarian, but those fell through when Trump decided to disparage Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “drug dealers.” Now, Trump is involved in lawsuits with both Andrés and Zakarian . Perhaps Benjamin Bar’s higher prices will help to pay for the president-elect’s legal bills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:22:23.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
