Sports that the decision to move the date of the fight will allow them more time to promote it. \nKoncz on Tuesday (Wednesday Manila time) finally got the chance to sit down with Top Rank Inc. chief Bob Arum in Las Vegas and iron out the details of the bout. \n“We decided to move it to May 19 here [US] and May 20 in the United [Arab] Emirates so we’d have time to promote it properly and make it a huge success,” Koncz told Iole. \nThe next step, according to Koncz, would be to inform Pacquiao and Khan of the change. \n“I have to talk to both fighters to get them to approve going in May instead of in April. I don’t think that will be any problem,” he added. Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nThe fight, which Koncz said will be staged either in Abu Dubai or Dubai, will be aired on pay-per-view in the United States. \nKhan got the opportunity to face Pacquiao in part because he topped a recent poll ran by the Filipino icon on Twitter. Of 44,185 votes, the British star got 48 percent, followed by his countryman Kell Brook (24 percent), American Terence Crawford (21 percent) and Australian prospect Jeff Horn (7 percent). \nKoncz said he found out that most of Khan’s votes came from US fans, leaving them pressed to promote the fight heavily to succeed in the US PPV market. \n“When I saw Amir ran away with it, I figured most of the votes from England and a lot of them came from the [UAE], but they told me that 86 percent of them were from the US,” Koncz continued. \n“That meant a lot. Obviously, Amir’s a big name in the US, too, as well as in England [where he lives] and people saw it for what it is: A toss-up fight against two fast-handed guys,” he also said. – Dino Maragay Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:03:37.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
