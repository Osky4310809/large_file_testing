The previous order had banned Syrian refugees indefinitely. \nAccording to the new order, the DHS will have 20 days to carry out a “global, country-by-country review of the identity and security information that each country provides to the U.S. government to support U.S. visa and other immigration benefit determinations.” Those countries would have 50 days to comply with requests to update or improve information provided to the U.S. \nCountries that don’t comply will be subject to official recommendations or restrictions.   \nAccording to Fox News , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said at a news conference Monday that the revised ban was a “vital measure for strengthening our national security,” adding that Trump was using “his rightful authority” to keep the country safe . \n“This order is part of our ongoing efforts to eliminate vulnerabilities that radical Islamic terrorists can and will exploit,” Tillerson added. \nIn a normal political environment, this updated order would help alleviate any objections created by the president’s first executive order. However, in 2017 America, we are talking about Democrats who still can’t accept the man duly elected to be president of the United States, and who have made it a mission to obstruct anything Trump does. \nThe fact that most Americans would agree with the goals of the new order means it’s likely very bad news for the left in the United States.
