(Photo: Screenshot via YouTube) Stay on target The Best Anime On Netflix Streaming Japanese Teacher Threatens to Write Students' Names in His 'Death Note' Well, here’s some surprising news to wake you up this morning. Netflix put out a trailer for their American remake of Death Note . The streaming service revealed the trailer on Twitter with the caption, “Shall we begin?” Which is also the final line of the trailer as Light appears to meet the Shinigami. The film is being directed by Adam Wingard, who was behind last year’s excellent Blair Witch . Wingard’s nightmarish style definitely fits the source material well.\nShall we begin? #DeathNote pic.twitter.com/fEd12Gm32c \n— Netflix US (@netflix) March 22, 2017 \n\nNat Wolf will play Light Turner (reserving judgment), a boy from Seattle who finds a notebook capable of killing anyone whose name is written in it. He soon begins to abuse that power, killing everyone he thinks deserves it. It’s the same plot as the original manga only set in Seattle. Also, he still goes by the name Kira for some reason, which only makes sense in Japanese. We’ll have to wait and see how they explain that one. In the end, it’s possible that none of this matters because Willem Dafoe will be playing Ryuk, the Shinigami at the end of the trailer. As if that thing wasn’t already scary enough.\nThe Death Note manga was such a huge hit that a move like this was inevitable. In Japan, it has been adapted into an anime series, live-action movies, video games, novels, and even a stage musical. (Singing Ryuk. Yeesh.) This American remake has been planned for a long time. Right now, we still have a bunch of questions. How much of the Japanese-specific elements will make their way over? Will it be super awkward when they do? Will this version of Seattle look anything like Seattle? Will they make a Keikaku joke?\nIn an AMA on Reddit last year , Wingard said the movie will loosely follow the first five volumes of the manga, with some major departures. The spirit, he says, is still there though it will end up being its own thing. He also called this “his most insane movie yet.” We’ll just have to wait until August 25 to find out.\nOne more thing, in that same AMA, he said the key to a good anime adaptation is “straying away from overt Anime style like Speed Racer and Dragon Ball.” OK, I’ll give you Dragon Ball, but you do not talk about the Skittles-for-your-eyes masterpiece that is Speed Racer , sir. This movie already lost points just for that comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:24:06.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
