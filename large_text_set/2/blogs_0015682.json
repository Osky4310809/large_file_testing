Well, we did a little research and dug out all the fun stuff from her trip for you. So, a couple of weeks ago, this Bollywood Diva went to her favourite vacation place for a delicious food trail with her bestie. She was on a much-needed vacation and has left us all drooling with her yummy Instagram videos and pictures. Just have a look! We are sure that it will leave you wanting to book flight tickets right away. 1. She arrived in Dubai all excited and, of course, looking fabulous.
