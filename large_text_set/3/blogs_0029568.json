Each season I reset myself to start from scratch, not settling for what I've already won. \n\"As long as I continue to want to win, both in the national team and in the club, I will continue playing. I hope it's the longest possible time â€” I see it [retirement] far in the future.\" \nHoping to profit from many more years of Ramos is Spain coach Julen Lopetegui, who is eager for his team to play with freedom on Tuesday, insisting they will not just be looking to nullify France's chief threats like Antoine Griezmann. \n\"Let's play thinking only about us,\" he said. \"We have a lot of respect for France, but the most important thing is to maintain the style, our football. \n\"We always face the game with confidence. We are aware of the strength of France, but we have our chance, we can play well.\" \nThe match is also going to be noteworthy due to the implementation of video technology for the first time in France, and while Lopetegui thinks it is a positive step, he believes the authorities need to find the balance when using it. \n\"The technology is welcome, but it needs to be applied in the right doses so that it does not lose freshness and interest,\" he said.
