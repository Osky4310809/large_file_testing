Wenger Out’ banner over The Hawthorns. It ended with growing vultures circling overhead scenting the manager’s blood as he was angrily heckled back on to the waiting team bus. \nThe Frenchman admits his side are enduring the worst spell he can remember after a fourth defeat in five league games. \nIt wasn’t just the result, but the manner which will have fanned the flames of those desperate to see him go. \nConceding two goals from Craig Dawson headers at corners and having just two shots on target at the other end was painful. So too will have been the plane stunt calling for his head — even though a pro-Wenger banner was also subsequently trailed by another aircraft.

But he insists his decision will not be influenced by whether they qualify for the Champions League amid claims he could yet end up signing a new deal. \n“No, I take a bigger perspective than that,” responded Wenger, when asked if it would shape his final judgement. \n“It will not necessarily be linked with that, because I have done the top four for 20 times. It is not that, or the last result, that will decide whether I will go. \n“Today, the Champions League on the sporting front would be a blow but financially the Champions League has not the impact it had five or six years ago, because of the influx of the Premier League TV money. Arsenal's only wins since February 11 have been over non-League sides Sutton and Lincoln (Photo: Rex Features) \n“If we don’t do it, we have to take the consequences — and then maybe one day people will enjoy it again to be in there. It will be very difficult now to do it. But I give my best as long as I am at the club, if it is for two more years or 10 more years or four more months.” \nWenger has promised an announcement on his future soon with his contract up and Albion counterpart Tony Pulis expects to face him next season, saying: “I’ll be surprised if he goes.” \nAfter this week's international break, Arsenal’s next Premier League game is Manchester City, who are also their opponents next month in the semi-finals of the FA Cup - Wenger's last chance of silverware this term. \nGunners midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain said: “We have this break to reflect and try to come up with a formula to get out of this run. \n“It has not been easy for us lately. It has not been pretty. \n\"We need to fight. How ever we do it we need to find a way top get back to winning.” Pulis will be making this face if anyone other than Wenger is Arsenal boss next season (Photo: Arsenal FC via Getty) \nThey will certainly have to practise defending at corners, after West Brom ruthlessly punished them at the set-piece. \nDawson capitalised to head in the opener in the 12th minute from Nacer Chadli’s delivery. \nArsenal rallied quickly, levelling through Sanchez’s close-range finish for his 18th league goal of the season. But they lost goalkeeper Petr Cech to a calf injury before the break and his replacement David Ospina was unconvincing. \nAlbion regained the lead 10 minutes into the second half when sub Hal Robson-Kanu poked in with only his second touch, 75 seconds after coming on. \nDanny Welbeck’s header from a corner struck the crossbar for Arsenal, who might also have had a penalty. But their hopes were ended when Dawson powered the ball in from James McClean’s corner for his third of the season — taking Albion's goal tally from set-pieces this term to 14.

We knew he’d have a free run into the box and Daws is very good in the air. \n“Daws seemed to have plenty of space. They probably didn’t defend that as well as they should have. We’ve got good deliveries coming in and that’s the most important thing.” poll loading After their loss to West Brom, are Arsenal going to finish in the top four? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:35:36.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
