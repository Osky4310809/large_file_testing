(Reminder for those not playing along at home: the brand provides early access to new shades of its cult-favorite liquid lipstick — sometimes at a discount! — for a limited time on Sephora's website.) For March's exciting launch, those who shop at the speed of light will be able to snap up K-Dub ($20), a neon-berry hue. \nThis new color is named after Kristin Walcott, the senior vice president and global general manager of Kendo Brands, whom Kat explained she looks up to in many ways. (Kendo is the umbrella corporation that runs Kat Von D as well as Marc Jacobs Beauty, Ole Henriksen, Bite Beauty, and Formula X.) \"She has played a key role in the growth of Kat Von D Beauty – plus she loves a bold lip!\" Kat revealed in a press release. \nRemember, you'll have to move quickly to snap up K-Dub. It'll only be available for 48 hours — or while supplies last — on Sephora.com starting at 12 p.m. Eastern time. Considering that the past two flash sales sold out in three hours, you should probably set a calendar reminder! ( Here's the landing page for the product so you don't waste any time.) If you miss out, though, don't worry. You'll still be able to shop this shade . . . you'll just have to wait until April 4. And maybe we're wrong, but we're pretty sure you'll want to rock it right away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:04:43.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
