Image copyright Reuters Image caption Chicago Supt Eddie Johnson \nChicago police found the girl one day after she went missing and contacted Facebook to have the video removed. \nThe girl is now out of hospital, but has not yet returned home. \nA relative of the girl, Reginald King, says he was the last to see her before the alleged attack, after the two attended church together on Sunday. \n\"Nobody deserves that. No human being deserves for that to happen to them,\" he told local media, adding that he suspects local \"thugs\" committed the attack. \nMr King said a local group of children are \"holding an entire community hostage\". \n\"I literally saw adults, 60 years old, my elders, my parents' age, cringeing in fear,\" he told the Chicago Tribune.
