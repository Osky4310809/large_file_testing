The alleged incident occurred at Irwin O. Addicott Elementary School during school hours.\nThe suit alleges no attempt was made to contact medical authorities, to 911, or poison control after it happened.\nThe mother is seeking for the Fresno Unified School District to cover past and future medical expenses. The exact amount is unspecified. After the incident, the student suffered aspiration pneumonia as well as “permanent impairment to her trachea, esophagus, stomach and lungs.”\nNo specific employee was named in the complaint as the person who administered the bleach.\nAmong the accusations, the mother says the district was negligent in trying to contact her, despite the girl “vomiting white chunks, turning purple and becoming otherwise and apparently ill.” That message, the suit says, was conveyed in a voicemail with no mention of the bleach. She says she only learned of it when she smelled the odor when she was checking on her daughter.\nThe lawsuit also alleges feeding supplies were stored in such a way they could be confused with cleaning supplies, leading to the alleged bleach mixup.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:48:45.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
