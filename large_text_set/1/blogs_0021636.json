Not too shabby of an effort, per usual of the Bad Lip readings. Obviously Trump isn’t really saying most of those things, but you can definitely see him doing so. As with the others. Especially Hilary channelling her inner batshit. Could’ve gotten a couple shots of Slick Willy in his hormonal charm. You don’t need to see his lips move to know what he’s thinking. \nPussy. He’s thinking about pussy. \nThe above lip reading is suitable, but Ted Cruz’s was spot on and psychotic. It would’ve been funny if it wasn’t actually what he was saying.
