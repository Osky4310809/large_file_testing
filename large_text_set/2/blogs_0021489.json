The Utah Jazz and Atlanta Hawks are other teams interested in signing the veteran floor general, according to Charania.\nWilliams, a Dallas native, is averaging 13.1 points and 6.9 assists in 29 minutes per game with the Mavericks. But the team has pivoted toward developing Yogi Ferrell as its full-time point guard for the future.\nThe Mavericks (22-34) are far from competing for a championship at 12th in the Western Conference standings. Would Williams rather compete for a title than endure a rebuild in his hometown? Most likely, but nothing is official yet.\nWilliams projects to be a good fit behind Kyrie Irving in Cleveland, given LeBron James ’ public demands for the team to go after a “f——— playmaker ” via free agency or trade. The Cavaliers’ only reserve point guard is rookie Kay Felder .\nWilliams enjoyed the heydays of his NBA career as a pick-and-roll maestro under Jerry Sloan’s Utah Jazz, where he averaged 17.3 points and 9.1 assists across six seasons alongside Carlos Boozer.
