Reddit \nReddit user lossaysswag , who is a friend of the crush in question, posted screenshots of the text messages exchanged between the two to see what the internet had to say about it. The guy begins by straightforwardly telling her he has a crush on her and he’d like to get to know her better. Reddit He seems approachable at first, though definitely a little too eager. Reddit \nThe girl’s response is one of pretty palpable trepidation. Meanwhile, his “S ?” has 14 O’s. \nShe chooses to leave the conversation where it is. Personally, I wouldn’t know what to do with a Cheerio’s bowl worth of O’s, either. Dude clearly couldn’t take a hint, though, because his next move was pretty outrageous. Imgur \nEven after receiving no response at all from this girl, he decided to send her balloons, an edible arrangement and a stuffed bear. This was the last straw for her. Reddit \nShe thanked him for the gift and then proceeded to execute possibly the most polite rejection I have ever witnessed. Yet, despite her mature response, he accuses her of liking “childish men” who treat her wrong. Even worse, he says she actually deserves a guy who won’t treat her well. \nAlso, I love how he claimed earlier he knows her well enough to say he has a crush on her, but apparently, she doesn’t know him well enough to decide he’s a little too much for her. I didn’t think it could, but it got worse. Reddit \nHe discredits her career AND assumes she has “many unsolved issues.” Hah, r ght, she’s the one with unsolved issues. Reddit users unanimously sided with the girl rather than the clingy guy on this one. Reddit What’s that saying again? Something about words and actions? One speaks louder than the other…? Reddit \nI think it’s probably always a tough day at the business factory, no? \nThis guy gives dudes everywhere such a bad name. I can only hope he stumbles upon this Reddit thread when he has a little time off from being a temperamental man-child at the business factory. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
