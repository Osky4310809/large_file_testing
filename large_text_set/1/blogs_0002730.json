The accusations originated from a Sept. 2 incident after the team‚Äôs season-opening win over Oregon State. \nFour players were originally suspended after the incident while Minneapolis police investigated. No charges were filed, but 10 players were suspended after the school finished its investigation. \nThose suspensions prompted the football team to temporarily boycott team activities and potentially the bowl game, which they ended up playing. Claeys went to Twitter after the team announced the boycott, supporting his players. The tweet went directly against the decision of his superiors, Athletic Director Mark Coyle and President Eric Kaler. Have never been more proud of our kids.
