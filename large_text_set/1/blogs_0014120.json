He said CNN was entitled to one since Trump had repeatedly attacked their organization. Trump refused, accusing him of stoking \"fake news\" for reporting on an uncorroborated BuzzFeed report. \nOn Monday, Acosta followed Trump to Trump Tower in New York City, where he asked a misleading question to Martin Luther King III following the civil rights leader's meeting with the president-elect. The reporter wanted to know what King thought of Trump's feud with Rep. John Lewis. However, Acosta editorialized and answered his own question before giving King a chance to respond. \n“Isn't that something that just cuts to your core when you hear the president-elect refer to John Lewis as all talk and no action,” Acosta asked King. “I mean nothing could be further from the truth, isn’t that right?
