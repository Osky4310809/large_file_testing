It provided a look at what baseball could be—and what it already is in some places, when freed from MLB’s hidebound propriety. The sport could be full of bat-flipping, chest-pounding, unwritten rule-breaking excitement—we could actually allow and encourage players to have fun playing it, and to display their joy, and to make it a more watchable experience for everyone.

But Puerto Rico truly looks like the team of this tournament. Paced by the bats of Correa, Javy Baez, Francisco Lindor, and Yadier Molina, Puerto Rico is 7-0, and will face the winner of tonight’s second semifinal between Japan and Team USA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:16:32.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
