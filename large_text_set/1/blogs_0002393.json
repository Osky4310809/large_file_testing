But if we learned anything during our time with the crew, it's that once you're a Wildcat, you're always a Wildcat. Coming off the epic 10-year reunion in 2016 , the latest mini get-together featured the two biggest starlets from the series, Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Hudgens . Tisdale welcomed her former costar to her YouTube channel to sing a sweet cover of \"Ex's & Oh's.\" Considering how the two never had a duet in the HSM movies, it's like we're getting the pairing we never knew we needed . . . until now.
