Jae Crowder (14 points, eight rebounds), Marcus Smart (10 points) and Al Horford (11 points) were the other C‚Äôs in double-figures. Kyle Lowry led the Raptors with 32 points, while former Celtic Jared Sullinger had a big night with 13 points. \nWith its fifth consecutive win, Boston improved to 31-18, while Toronto dropped to 30-20. \nHere‚Äôs how it all went down. \nSTARTING FIVE Isaiah Thomas, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, Amir Johnson, Al Horford \nBAD START, BETTER FINISH The Raptors scored the first seven points and led 24-13 with under two minutes remaining in the first quarter, but the C‚Äôs mounted a 15-6 rally at the end of the frame to keep it close. Boston‚Äôs big weapon during that stretch was it‚Äôs 3-point shooting, as Thomas made two and Jonas Jerebko and Smart each made one. The second of those Thomas 3-pointers came from way downtown in the closing seconds. \nJUST BAD Toronto had another strong quarter offensively in the second, and this time Boston couldn‚Äôt mount a comeback late. The Raptors went on a 9-0 run during the frame to take a 45-32 lead, and they led by double digits for most of the remaining time before the half. \nToronto only made 4 of 17 3-point shots in the first half, but it fared much better inside the arc by making a remarkable 21 of 26 shots. And in unsurprising news, the Raptors held a 27-17 rebounding advantage through the first 24 minutes. Thomas was the game‚Äôs leading scorer in the first half with 20 points. \nTHE KING IN THE FOURTH The Raptors maintained a pretty healthy advantage for most of the third quarter, but the C‚Äôs did cut their deficit to single digits at 85-77 heading into the fourth. \nThe Celtics came to within five points multiple times in the first half of the fourth, one of which came after Brown made two free throws after he was fouled hard while driving to the basket. He appeared to take exception to the play, and things got a bit heated between both teams. On the next C‚Äôs possession, Brown responded with this: This is what happens when you make Jaylen Brown mad. pic.twitter.com/UGbzbj72Ki \n‚Äî Taylor C. Snow (@taylorcsnow) February 2, 2017 \nThomas then powered the Celtics to the lead thanks to seven consecutive points, which made it 95-94 Boston with 4:38 remaining. And Thomas and the Celtics pulled out the win after a thrilling close to the divisional showdown. \nPLAY OF THE GAME Here‚Äôs that IT 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter: IT's got range. üî•üî•üî• pic.twitter.com/cZPoAvY05f \n‚Äî Boston Celtics (@celtics) February 2, 2017 \nUP NEXT La La Land is heading to Boston.
