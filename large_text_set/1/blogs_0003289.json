This is an increase of RM1,499 over the 2016 price of RM35,296. \nCarrying a 689 cc liquid-cooled DOHC parallel-twin engine fed by EFI, the MT-07 is rated at 73.7 hp at 9,000 rpm and 68 Nm of torque at 6,500 rpm. Power gets to the ground via a six-speed gearbox and chain drive. \nWeighing in at 179 kg, the MT-07 is stopped by dual 282 mm brake discs in front and a single 245 mm disc at the back. Fuel is carried in a 14-litre tank, and the seat is a reasonable 805 mm in height. \nThe naked sports MT-07 has proven to be a perennial best-seller for Yamaha, due to its affordability as an “entry-level” big bike. When we reviewed the MT-07 last year, we found it to be fairly competent in its role, despite the budget suspension. \nBoth new colour schemes, the Night Fluo and Yamaha Blue, have trickled down from the Yamaha MT-07’s bigger sibling, the three-cylinder Yamaha MT-09 . With the new retail price, the 2017 Yamaha MT-07 will be available in Yamaha dealer showrooms from mid-January.
