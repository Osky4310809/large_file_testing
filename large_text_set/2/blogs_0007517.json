Since then, five of his teammates have declared that they too will not attend; running back LaGarrette Blount , defensive lineman Alan Branch , linebacker Dont’a Hightower , defensive end Chris Long , and defensive back Devin McCourty . \nBranch and Hightower have not cited politics or President Donald Trump in particular as reasons they are skipping the ceremony. (Hightower also skipped the ceremony in 2015 following the team’s Super Bowl XLIX win.) The other four players, however, have either hinted at or outright stated that they will not partake in the ceremony for political reasons. \n“I don’t feel accepted in the White House,” McCourty said, according to Time . With the President having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t.” \n“I just don’t feel welcome into that house,” Blount said on The Rich Eisen Show “I’m just gonna leave it at that.” \n[ image via screengrab ] \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \nHave a tip we should know?
