Now it is a snow plow called “The Red Bull.” I find this to be absolutely badass.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nIn 1996, the bus began its life as a typical school bus, serving as transportation for children to and from the delightful halls of school in the Cleveland Metro School district. Once the district’s new buses came in, however, the old bus was retired.\nJustin Kobak, who works for the district, told Jalopnik in an email,\nAdvertisement \n\n“When we got our new buses this one was retired. We were contracting out our plowing of our 3 school bus lots when my boss had a great idea. Let’s put a plow on an old bus and have our mechanics plow the lot... Amazingly it does the job [perfectly]!”\nKobak says that in the nearly 10 years that the bus has been in service, it has never gotten stuck in the snow. There have been three “versions” of it, and the latest is the one you see here.\n\nFor this version, the frame was hacked off past the rear axles to help it turn with improved clearance. The body shop, which has spent nearly 500 hours on the bus since it came out of retirement, did most of the work, including painting it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T04:30:10.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
