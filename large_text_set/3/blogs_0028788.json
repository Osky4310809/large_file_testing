But gay porn star Kayden Gray is calling on his fans to see him as more than just his member in a two-minute video he shared on his Twitter. \nCaptioned “More than a dick”, the video starts with Gray talking about how he’s “obsessed” with sharing his life to his followers, but there’s been something that’s been bothering him for a while. Apparently, even when he tweets stuff not related to his work as a porn star, all he gets are replies that go “Daddy” or “Fuck me”. \nWhile he clarifies that he’s not complaining about the attention he gets, he does stress that even before he became a part of the porn industry, he understood that porn stars are people too. \n“I understood that they are people with lives and personalities and complexities that goes way beyond the sexual aspect,” he reveals. “So I am just a little bit disappointed that when I share the parts of my life that are meaningful, a lot of people can do no better than to reduce all of that – all of me – to sex.” \nWatch the Twitter video below More than a dick pic.twitter.com/3jGITGIVtn \n— Kayden Gray (@KaydenGrayXXX) March 21, 2017 \nAdam4Adam readers, are you able to see the person behind the porn star when you’re watching porn?
