The star-crossed lovers — she from Krypton and he from Daxam — sealed their new romantic relationship with a long-awaited kiss, which quickly developed into a steamy (for CW standards) makeout session on her couch. \nFor fans of the show, it was great to finally see those two characters come together as the chemistry between Melissa Benoist , 28, and Chris Wood , 28, has been sizzling hot all season long. And now we know why... According to Entertainment Tonight , Benoist and Wood's on-screen relationship has blossomed into a real, off-screen relationship as well. On Monday, away from the Vancouver set of Supergirl , the real-life couple were \"spotted out together, smiling and talking while walking their dogs in the chilly Canadian weather.\" \nWhen Entertainment Tonight visited the Supergirl set last month, Wood gushed about working with Benoist. \"[Melissa and I have] found this nice pocket for the characters to live in,\" Wood shared. \"It was just so easy to play and she's just so generous as an actress that she just keeps it rolling. She makes it easy.\" \nNot to sully their romance, but this isn't the first time Benoist has fallen for someone she has worked with. She fell for Blake Jenner while working together on Glee . The two got married in the spring of 2015; however, this past December, she filed for divorce from him. By the way, Jenner also made a guest appearance on the first season of Supergirl , playing Cat Grant's estranged son. \nA new villain (guest star Teri Hatcher) comes to National City, putting Supergirl ( Melissa Benoist ) on high alert. Meanwhile, Winn’s (Jeremy Jordan) girlfriend, Lyra (guest star Tamzin Merchant), gets Winn in trouble with the law. Maggie (guest star Floriana Lima) attempts to help Winn but old loyalties get in the way. The Music Meister (Darren Criss) attacks Supergirl. \nJohn Medlen directed the episode written by Katie Rose Rogers & Jess Kardos. \nMORE: Cadmus Abducts An Alien in New Supergirl Clip / Lyra Gets Abducted in Exodus Featurette / Supergirl Wraps Production On Kevin Smith's New Episode / Teri Hatcher, Darren Criss Come To National City In New Synopsis \nDistributed worldwide by Warner Bros.
