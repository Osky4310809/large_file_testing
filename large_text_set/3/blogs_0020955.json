MP Jo Cox was stabbed and shot to death in June 2016 by a white supremacist . \nThe two Times reporters also neglected the decades-long campaign by the Provisional IRA against the British government. The nationalist terrorist group conducted major terrorist attacks in Britain in 1982 , 1984 (where they tried to assassinate Margaret Thatcher), and 1989 . The organization also conducted bombings in the 1990s until the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. \n[image via screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
