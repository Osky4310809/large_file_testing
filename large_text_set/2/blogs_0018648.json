In what was without a doubt the saddest moment on This Is Us so far, Randall's biological father, William, succumbed to his cancer and passed away on Tuesday night's episode. Even though we all knew it would happen eventually, the scene still left us completely devastated. After the father-son duo take a road trip to William's hometown of Memphis, he suddenly takes a bad turn and is rushed to the ER. As William slowly slips away in his hospital bed, Randall comforts him the same way his father, Jack, used to ease his anxiety by putting his hands on his face and telling him to breathe. While we couldn't help but choke on our tears, the cast shared similar sentiments. Sterling K. Brown even took to Facebook Live after the episode to have a good cry with everyone. See some of the best reactions below. Mandy Moore An outstanding standalone episode with 2 giants ( @sterlingkb1 and #roncephasjones ). How lucky we are to witness the magic tonight. #thisisus pic.twitter.com/PqIIbTbzIz \n— Mandy Moore (@TheMandyMoore) February 21, 2017 Chrissy Metz I couldn't tweet through the tears.
