(Photo: Diyah Pera, The CW) \nWe got trouble, my friends, right here in Riverdale city. \nNot just trouble, but the kind that goes way beyond Archie’s once-standard dilemma of whether to share his milkshake with Betty, Veronica, or both. And against all odds, that turns out to be a surprisingly good thing. \nGranted, those who have watched Archie Comics take their hero from his aw-shucks teen days of the 1940s, 50s and 60s to his recent zombie-fighter adventures may not be surprised by the darker Archie Andrews you'll see in CW's Riverdale (Thursday, 9 ET/PT, *** out of four). But for many, seeing Archie tussle with murder, bribery, illicit sex, and slut shaming, to name just a few of Riverdale’s issues, is going to be something of a shock. \nThat this new series works so well, or at all, is a tribute to its creator, Archie Comics chief’ Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (whose credits range from Glee to the Broadway musical flop American Psycho ,) and to executive producer Greg Berlanti. Having revived CW and the superhero genre with Arrow and The Flash , Berlanti now proves he may be just the man to revive the teen drama. \nFrequently described as Twin Peak s meets Gossip Girl (or, cynics might say, Pretty Little Liars ), Riverdale stars KJ Apa as a hotter-than-he’s-drawn Archie. His best friend, the smart but perhaps not as sweet as she seems Betty (Lili Reinhart) has a crush on him — unaware that he's having a torrid affair with his high-school music teacher Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). \nLike many teenagers, Archie, 16, is at that point in his life where everything seems to change at once. He’s rejecting a career with his dad (Luke Perry) in favor of music. His stable friendships with Betty and Jughead (Cole Sprouse) are being disrupted by Ms. Grundy and the new girl in town, Veronica (Camila Mendes). \nOh, and then there’s the murder of the star quarterback, Jason — a murder that may have something to do with Jason’s sister Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch), the evil queen of the high-school social set. \nJughead Jones (Cole Sprouse) and Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) drop in at the local diner on CW's 'Riverdale.' (Photo: CW) \nThursday’s opener sets up multiple plot lines and conflicts, and while they don’t all pan out over the four episodes made available for preview, enough do to make Riverdale one of midseason’s more promising shows. \nAt the top of the list are the reworked relationship between Betty and Veronica, and the appealing performances from Reinhart and Mendes. But then, most of the teenage characters have been created (or re-created) cleverly — with the notable exception of Cheryl, a ridiculously overdone character borrowed lock, stock and entourage from Scream Queens. \nUnfortunately, the overall strength of the teens does not extend to the dull adults who surround them. Perry’s Fred is a cipher, obstinate one moment and then far too supportive the next, and if Madchen Amick is truly determined to go this far over the top as Betty's mother, she needs to find a way to make the journey entertaining. \nStill, they’re side notes in a show that is built on hormones and mystery, with an added musical bonus from a revamped, African-American Josie and the Pussycats. And yes, you are going to have to hear Sugar, Sugar — but you probably realized that was part of the price of admission. \nIf that's the worst trouble Riverdale faces, it's in for a smooth ride. 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE  //usat.ly/2jr7HjJ  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:45:27.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
