It will be an Obama appointee.”\nHe said there was “no word from the White House on who that will be.”\nTodd then asked an expert if the line of succession switches to the new presidency at noon.\nThe former director of the Continuity of Government Commission, John Fortier, explained that there are two lines of succession, one that is already in place and one that will not be in place until the inauguration is over.\n” … And one which really won’t be in place until Donald Trump is inaugurated, comes into office, and actually formally nominates and the Senate confirms his people,” Fortier said. “You might actually end up with a president from the prior administration because of a tragedy.”\nSince Secretary of State John Kerry will be officially out of office on Friday by noon, and Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee to head the State Department, will not be confirmed by then, the person to take over the position could be Obama appointee Tom Shannon, the undersecretary for political affairs.\nHe is the highest ranking non-political official.\nTodd said Former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman was the designated survivor during one of Bill Clinton’s State of the Union addresses.\n“In 1997, during an address by President Clinton to Congress, he [Glickman] was the designated survivor,” Todd said.” He left Washington and went to his daughter’s apartment in Manhattan but he wasn’t alone. The role is a serious one and he says he was accompanied by a doctor, a military officer with access to the nuclear codes, and the Secret Service.”\nQuestion: If Fox News had run a similar segment on January 19, 2009, the reaction of Democrats and the media would have been ....(Fill in the blank.)\nWhat was the purpose of this little exercise in Constitutional impossibilities? There's a better chance that President Obama will appear before the press tomorrow morning and apologize for being such a royal screw up as president than there is that the Republican leaders in government will all go down in a hail of bullets or a massive bomb blast before noon.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/19/cnns-wonders-about-trump-pence-assassination-leaving-obama-administration-in-charge/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxIG4dduqy0", "http://freebeacon.com/politics/cnn-trump-other-top-officials-killed-inauguration-obama-admin-take-over/"], "published": "2017-01-19T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:02:28.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
