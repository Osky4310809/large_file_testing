This week, in prime time, we can watch The Checkout: Best Before . A clever way of saying, The Checkout: The Bits We‚Äôve Already Aired . \nARE WE REALLY WATCHING LESS? \nCertainly on Christmas Day audiences fall off a cliff. The highest rating show on Christmas Day was Seven News but at just 675,000 viewers it was way below the million-plus the bulletin can usually muster. \nBut other than that, the theory that less people are watching television seems to be on shaky ground. \nOn Tuesday, the Oztam ratings showed five programs with more than one million viewers. \nCompare that to late October in the heart of ratings season, when only three shows had more than one million viewers. One of those was the Australian Survivor grand finale ‚Äî a big audience drawcard while the current schedule has no first-run Australian reality shows.

Well go back to Monday and Australia essentially had a choice of sport, sport, sport and A Good Day to Die Hard ‚Äî easily the weakest of the yippee ki yea franchise. \nIt‚Äôs enough to turn you to pay tv and streaming services such as Stan and Netflix. \n‚ÄúFoxtel does not follow the commercial ratings season patterns so we continue to premiere great shows as they go to air in the US or UK, or our own original programming,‚Äù a spokesman for the broadcaster (half owned by News Corp Australia, publisher of news.com.au) said. \nFoxtel has, or will, premiere a slew of shows over the break including Coast Australia , The Mr Robot and two Home and Away special episodes as well as the much anticipated HBO documentary Bright Lights starring the late Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. \nWhile Netflix wouldn‚Äôt reveal to news.com.au whether streams increased in non-rating period it did point out it had saved many of the year‚Äôs biggest shows for the summer. \nSeries that are likely to be a hit with families, like Lemony Snicket‚Äôs A Series of Unfortunate Events and Trollhunters are two of Netflix‚Äôs big summer releases. While to much anticipation, the US streaming service uploaded a Christmas special of hit drama Sense8 . Here in Australia it's almost 3am 23rd of December & all i can think is \"Hurry up @sense8 Christmas Special!!\" üòñ #sense8 #sense8christmas ‚Äî markchurches (@markchurches) December 22, 2016 \nStan, meanwhile, is heavily advertising its wares by talking up new shows such as the Benedict Cumberbatch feast Sherlock . It‚Äôs being screened at the same time as in the UK where non ratings doesn‚Äôt really exist. \nSome stations seemed to have sensed the frustration of viewers. 9 Now, the network‚Äôs catch up service, has announced a summer time ‚Äòbinge for free‚Äô collection of popular programs such as House Husbands available for download in advance of new shows kicking in. \nNine‚Äôs digital chief, Alex Parsons, said the downloadable shows was designed to fill the schedule gap. ‚ÄúWe have 2.3 million customers who have signed up to 9 Now and we know they will want quality Australian content over the holiday period.‚Äù Stan has been heavily pushing BBC show Sherlock during free-to-air non ratings period. Source: Supplied \nOther networks have spied an opportunity. \nChannel 10‚Äôs morning show, Studio 10, has become something of a sleeper summer hit reaping the rewards of staying on air during non ratings as its cutthroat rivals either head off for a siesta or air ‚Äòbest of‚Äô repeats. \n‚Äú Studio 10 will surely be getting extra eyeballs with new episodes on fresh topics,‚Äù said Mr Knox. \n‚ÄúIt still has ground to make up against the competition but the rising tide lifts all boats whenever there is more people home on holidays.‚Äù Studio 10 says ratings have gone up.

Source: Supplied ‚Äî ‚ù§Lynne Johansen (@MzsJoJo) January 3, 2017 \nChannel 10‚Äôs strategy will be that some of those extra eyeballs stay glued when ratings kick in again come February. \nTo a lesser extent, all the big commercial channels have been trying a similar tactic, at least towards the end of the off season. \n‚ÄúIn the last few years, networks have all launched big shows before the ratings starter gun to try and get a head start,‚Äù said Mr Knox. \n‚ÄúThe two-week period between the end of the tennis and the start of [ratings] is peak for new shows. Any earlier and you risk competing with any Aussies in the [tennis] final and school holidays,‚Äù he said. \n‚ÄúNine has already confirmed Married at First Sight for January 30 to try and claim the space, but Seven won‚Äôt have a bar of it. I‚Äôd pencil in I ‚Äôm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here for January 29, if previous years are anything to go by.‚Äù \nBut that‚Äôs still weeks away. \n‚ÄúStreaming services, iView and SBS On Demand are great alternatives if you have fast internet,‚Äù advised Mr Knox. \nSo, perhaps if the networks are ignoring us through the TV schedule we should ignore them and check back in during the last week in January when TV once again takes Australia seriously.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T08:02:24.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
