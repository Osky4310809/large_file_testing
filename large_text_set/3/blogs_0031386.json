Mar 29, 2017 8:00 PM 0 \nThe Establishment is setting up Donald Trump. \nThe mainstream media hates him. Hollywood hates him. The “Intellectual Yet Idiot” academia class hates him. \nMost critically, the CIA hates him. So does the rest of the Deep State, or the permanently entrenched “national security” bureaucracy. They did everything possible to stop Trump from taking office. None of it worked. \nI think the CIA hates Trump for a very simple reason: he’s threatening to take away their livelihood. \nTrump wants to make nice with Putin and the Russians. But countering the so-called “Russian threat” is how many thousands of Deep State bureaucrats make a living. \nThese people feed off the trough of the $1 trillion-plus military/security budget. Playing nice with the Russians would kill their jobs—and end their way of life. \nTrump has said: We will pursue a new foreign policy that finally learns from the mistakes of the past. We will stop looking to topple regimes and overthrow governments. \nToppling regimes is the CIA’s bread and butter. No wonder they hate him. \nOf course, the feeling is mutual. Trump has used plenty of sharp words to describe the “intelligence community.” He’s reportedly aiming to fundamentally restructure the CIA. \nJohn F. Kennedy’s Battle with the CIA \nDonald Trump is the first president since John F. Kennedy to openly take on the CIA. \nAfter being suckered into the Bay of Pigs disaster in Cuba, JFK said he wanted \"to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds.\" \nKennedy fired CIA Director Allen Dulles. But that was about as far as he got. \nJFK, of course, failed to break the Deep State’s grasp on power. In an ironic twist, Allen Dulles would later be appointed to the Warren Commission to investigate Kennedy’s assassination. \nThe CIA is the undisputed all-time world champion of orchestrating coups. And right now, Trump is squarely on its radar… How the Deep State Will Take Down Trump \nThe way I see it, the Deep State has three main cards to play against Trump. If one doesn’t work, they’ll move on to the next one. \nThe Delegitimization Card \nThe John F. Kennedy Card The Delegitimization Card \nThere’s a joke that goes something like this… Question: Why can there be no “color revolution” in the US? Answer: Because there are no US embassies in the US. \nTo get the joke you have to understand the role the US played—through CIA officers based out of US embassies—in orchestrating various color-coded revolutions, really coups d’état, over the past 17 years: \nThe Bulldozer Revolution in Serbia (2000) \nThe Rose Revolution in Georgia (2003) \nThe Orange and Euromaidan Revolutions in Ukraine (2004 and 2014) \nThe Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan (2005) \nThe Cedar Revolution in Lebanon (2005) \nThe Jeans Revolution in Belarus (2006) \nThe Saffron Revolution in Myanmar (2007) \nThe Green Revolution in Iran (2009)… though that one didn't work. \nThe Grape Revolution in Moldova (2009) \nThe Colorful Revolution in Macedonia (2016) \nAll of these AstroTurf revolutions have one thing in common. In each case, George Soros’ NGOs helped delegitimize the targeted government. \nOf course, there were valid grievances against these governments. But the US Deep State manipulated these situations to advance its geopolitical agenda. \nHere’s how it worked: Soros’ NGOs would help fund and organize “professional protestors.” Then they’d use color-specific branding to help rally others to their cause. \nSoros has turned colored revolutions into a science. The pattern is predictable. Now it’s playing out in the US. \nIt smells to me like the CIA and George Soros’ NGOs are trying to start a “color revolution” in the US, just like they’ve done in numerous foreign countries. \nThe US color revolution already has a color. It’s purple, the mix of red and blue (i.e., red and blue states). \nHillary Clinton has developed a recent fondness for purple. She’s worn purple in almost every public appearance since the election. \nHillary Clinton’s concession speech. Notice her purple blouse and Bill’s purple tie. \nThere’s also a flood of social media postings about the color purple. So the branding is already done. And, of course, the professional protestors financed and organized by George Soros are already there. \nAgain, there are valid complaints against Trump. But the Usual Suspects are using their usual tricks to remove a government they don’t like. It just happens that, this time, the target government is in Washington, D.C., instead of Eastern Europe or the Middle East. \nI don’t think the Deep State can get rid of Trump with the Delegitimization Card alone. So they will have to escalate to the next option. The Herbert Hoover Card \nWhen people think of President Hoover, they mostly think of the Great Depression. \nThroughout the 1920s, the Federal Reserve’s easy money policies helped create an enormous stock market bubble. \nIn August 1929, the Fed raised interest rates and effectively ended the easy credit. Only a few months later, the bubble burst on Black Tuesday, in October 1929—barely seven months after Hoover took office. The Dow lost over 12% that day. \nIt was the most devastating stock market crash in the US up to that point. It also signaled the beginning of the Great Depression. \nThis happened on Hoover’s watch. And because of that, people pinned the blame squarely on him, regardless of where the fault lied. \nHoover inherited a stock market bubble near its peak—fueled by the Fed’s easy money policies. \nI think Trump has, too. And he knows it. In recent months he’s called the stock market a “big, fat, ugly bubble.” \nThere’s an excellent chance this bubble will burst on Trump’s watch. And Democrats will pin the blame on him, just as they did with Hoover. \nIf that doesn’t work, the Deep State still has one card left. The John F. Kennedy Card \nChuck Schumer, a powerful Democratic senator and quintessential Deep State swamp creature, recently discussed the war between Trump and the intelligence community on TV. \nSchumer said, “Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.” \nIt doesn’t take much imagination to understand what he’s alluding to. \nOf course, the Deep State could try to assassinate Trump. It’s obvious the possibility has crossed his mind. He’s taken the unusual step of supplementing his Secret Service protection with loyal private security. There are only three possible outcomes to the Deep State’s war on Trump… \nTrump will defeat the Deep State. \nThe Deep State will co-opt Trump. \nThe Deep State will overthrow Trump. \nAs things stand, I think it’s unlikely Trump will defeat the Deep State. It’s been entrenched for decades. And it’s far more powerful than the president. \nIt’s also unlikely the Deep State will co-opt Trump. It’s just not in his personality to submit and roll over. He didn’t overcome all the odds to become president just to be another empty suit. \nThe Deep State will play the Herbert Hoover Card next. But if that doesn’t work—or if the Deep State starts to get antsy—they’ll move forward to overthrow him by any means possible. \nThe Deep State is planning moves during Trump’s first 100 days in office that could change everything in sudden and unexpected ways. \n* * * \nNew York Times best-selling author Doug Casey and I put together this time-sensitive video explaining how it could all go down.
