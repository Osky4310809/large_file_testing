He was cut by the Bills in 2012, the Packers in 2013 and the Browns in 2014, all without playing in a game. \nYoung, the No. 3 pick in the 2006 NFL Draft, last played in 2011 with the Eagles. He spent five years with the Titans and twice went to the Pro Bowl. \nIt’s not likely that an NFL team would give Young another look without Young proving he still can play and avoid some of the off-field headlines he’s made in recent years, so the CFL might be a good place for Young to start.
