PUNCH Metro learnt that Asunmo stabbed Fatai to death with a knife at the White Sand area of Ijora Badia, during a scuffle over a prostitute. The suspect was said to have challenged the victim over his relationship with the lady, whom he (Asunmo) was dating. Despite his denial, Asunmo was alleged to have attacked the victim and fled the area. A community leader, who did not want to be identified, said his attention was called to Asunmo’s corpse, which was abandoned on a heap of refuse in the area. He said, “I was told that the two men fought and one stabbed the other to death. The police from the Ijora Badia came to take the corpse away.” When our correspondent approached other residents, they said they were informed by friends. However, a woman, who did not identify herself, said the two men were drunk. She said, “The men were always fighting after drinking. They fought after they were inebriated.” Another resident said the victim was a driver, while the suspect had no job. A police source said Asunmo and Fatai had a disagreement over a woman. He said, “Asunmo suspected that Fatai was dating his girlfriend and he confronted him. Although the man denied, he attacked and killed him. The woman in question is a prostitute.” The Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, said the suspect had been arrested. She said, “The corpse has been deposited in the morgue of the Mainland General Hospital. The suspect, who initially escaped, has been arrested.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:43:06.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
