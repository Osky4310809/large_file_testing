Tilted Kilt , the self-proclaimed “Best Looking Sports Pub You’ve Ever Seen,” took over the former Copperfield’s space at 96 Brookline Ave. and is finally ready to introduce itself to the neighborhood. The Vegas-based sports pub will have 30 beers on tap and some local special entrees, including a shepherd’s pie, a Wicked Boston Burger, fish and chips, and clam chowder. Located near Fenway Park and the neighborhood’s concert venues, Tilted Kilt will also have 50 televisions to accommodate sports fans. This will be the second Tilted Kilt in Massachusetts, adding to the one in Billerica . The restaurant famously employs Kilt Girls as servers, who audition to wear the restaurant’s mini-kilt and plaid crop-top uniform.
