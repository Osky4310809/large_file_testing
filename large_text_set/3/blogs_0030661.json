Neuralink was registered as a medical-research company in California in July. \nNeural lace involves implanting electrodes in the brain so people could upload or download their thoughts to or from a computer, according to the report. The product could allow humans to achieve higher levels of cognitive function. \nTesla declined to comment on the veracity of The Journal's report. \nMusk has expressed his interest in neural lace technology before. Musk first described the potential product at Vox Media's Code Conference in 2016, saying it would allow humans to achieve symbiosis with machines. \nHe said neural lace could prevent a person from becoming a \"house cat\" to artificial intelligence. \n\"The solution that seems maybe the best is to have an AI layer,\" Musk said at the Vox Code Conference. \"A third, digital layer that could work symbiotically.\" \nMusk said on Twitter in January that he was preparing for an announcement regarding neural lace. \nFacebook is also exploring similar technology through Building 8, its secretive hardware division. The group is developing noninvasive brain-computer interface technology that would allow people to communicate with external hardware devices. \nTesla \nMusk is attempting to set up safety standards for artificial intelligence through his nonprofit, OpenAI , which he founded with Y Combinator's Sam Altman in 2015. OpenAI's mission is to \"advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.\" \nBut Neuralink's first products could involve using implants to treat disorders like epilepsy or major depression, according to The Journal. \nResearchers at universities like the University of California and Duke are also developing brain-computer interface technology that would allow people with paraplegia to walk again . \nMusk also plans to launch the Boring Company , a venture dedicated to building an underground network of tunnels to reduce traffic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:16:55.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
