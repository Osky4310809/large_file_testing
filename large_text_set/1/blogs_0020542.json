They beat the Celtics, 123-108, in Washington D.C. Before the game, Wizards players showed up as promised in all black. It was even reported from Candace Buckner of the Washington Post that if players did not wear all black, they would have to shave their heads.\nAll business. pic.twitter.com/fllTLXusby \n— SLAM Magazine (@SLAMonline) January 25, 2017 The game started with players from both sides avoiding pregame hand shakes, but that was about the last thing we’d see from the rivalry. The game never got heated and the crowd didn’t seem all that interested, either. The Wizards were in charge of the game all night up and were 11 to start the fourth quarter. The Celtics got within single digits a few times, but could never fully complete the comeback.\nThe point guards in the Eastern Conference are special this year, and Tuesday night was no different. John Wall led the way with 27 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists for the Wizards, while Isaiah Thomas kept up his strong play with 25 points and 13 assists.\nThe Celtics have lost three games in a row, but still are hanging on to the No. 3 spot in the East thanks to the fact the Raptors have lost four in a row and the Cavaliers have lost five of seven. Meanwhile, the Wizards are still climbing, winning eight of their last 10 games, and are currently only a game-and-a-half out of third place.\nAndrew Wiggins hit his first buzzer-beater Wiggins, who is still only 21 years old, scored 31 points on Tuesday night, including this game winner over the Suns . What’s even more impressive is he lost his balance on this play, but was able to get it back and still hit the shot.\nANDREW WIGGINS pic.twitter.com/F7wIh8uhK4 \n— Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) January 25, 2017 Blake Griffin returned to the Clippers The Clippers couldn’t stop The Process on Tuesday night and lost to the Sixers, 121-110. On the bright side, Blake Griffin returned for the first time since mid-December after missing 18 games for minor knee surgery. He scored 12 points and had 11 rebounds on the night, but that wasn’t enough to hold off the somewhat surging Sixers. At least we saw a few things from Griffin that we’re used to.\nBlake back. #ItTakesEverything pic.twitter.com/WijJ2C80cd \n— NBA (@NBA) January 25, 2017 Dunk of the Night Bledsoe ➡ Chriss #WeArePHX pic.twitter.com/B9WqWj0oS0 \n— NBA (@NBA) January 25, 2017 Block of the Night KAT ✋ #PowerOfThePack pic.twitter.com/eJ0yke5zK3 \n— NBA (@NBA) January 25, 2017 Robin Lopez had another mascot feud \nScott Brooks’ daughter told him he looked “chunky” in black pants! \nScores Washington Wizards 123, Boston Celtics 108 ( Bullets Forever recap | Celtics Blog recap )\nSan Antonio Spurs 108, Toronto Raptors 106 ( Pounding the Rock recap | Raptors HQ recap )\nPhiladelphia 76ers 121, Los Angeles Clippers 110 ( Liberty Ballers recap | Clips Nation recap )\nChicago Bulls 100, Orlando Magic 92 ( Blog A Bull recap | Orlando Pinstriped Post recap )\nMinnesota Timberwolves 112, Phoenix Suns 111 ( Canis Hoopus recap | Bright Side of the Sun recap )\nDenver Nuggets 103, Utah Jazz 93 ( Denver Stiffs recap | SLC Dunk recap )\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T16:10:40.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
