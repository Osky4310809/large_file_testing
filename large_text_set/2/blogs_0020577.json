She doesn't want to sit on his lap. \nMiss Julia is enraged, and all her billionaire boyfriend Russi Billimoria does -- as the man in charge, her lover, her producer -- is slap the inside of his left thigh, inviting his tigress to clamber aboard so he can make it all better. \nShe seethes while he smugly and knowingly slaps his goddamn thigh. \nJulia wants to defy him, but dare not, and she cycles through her fury, before, in her own way, showing as much non-compliance as may be mustered. \nShe does indeed go to him and allow herself to be patted down and placated, but she perches on his right thigh instead. \nRangoon , Vishal Bhardwaj's new film, is his loudest and largest, a period drama that blasts off with an impressive, immersive war sequence that wouldn't be out of place in something by Christopher Nolan. \nIt is also, by some degree, his most accessible film, one that leans less on metaphor and symbolism and more directly on plot. \nThe emotions are overt, the triggers are obvious, the fundamentals spoonfed to the audience more than Bhardwaj usually does, but the world he conjures is stunning. \nThis is a barnstormer, but one made with superlative craftsmanship. 'I can't say I'm as big as the Khans' \nThis is also Bhardwaj's own gleeful riff on what Quentin Tarantino did with Inglourious Basterds -- it is a film where the Indian auteur uses a thicker paintbrush to earn a grander canvas for him to draw out his own wishfully revisionist historical fiction. \nSubhas Chandra Bose's revolutionary Indian National Army features prominently in this pre-Independence wartime saga, with Bhardwaj himself unforgettably singing the Azad Hind Fauj anthem, Tagore's Jana Gana Mana as rewritten by Bose. \nThat, however, is later. First, as movie posters of the day used to promise, come the 'Thrills! Chills! Spectacle!', and rightfully so. \nThe year is 1943, and while Indian soldiers fighting under the British flag are being imprisoned by the Japanese army, a young girl known for her stuntwork is making waves as India's most popular cinematic attraction. Miss Julia is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition, a bright and beguiling cauliflower-haired sensation who swings from chandeliers, runs across tops of trains, and fights off pirates with swashbuckling flair. \nWith her black eyemask and trim figure, she may as well be called the Lean Ranger. 'I will be unemployed after Rangoon, Padmavati' \nIt is this magnificent sideshow-attraction who swallows her pride (in a way that she probably can swords) for Russi, a one-armed magnate who was once, like her, an action hero doing his own stunts. \nHe now finances the movies, and is seduced by the idea of an army tour for his staggeringly popular Miss Julia, one where she can go boost army morale and help protect his chummy camaraderie with the British. \nThe best laid plans, as we know, don't belong in the movies. \nThis seemingly innocuous idea leads to wartorn bloodshed and revolutionary chaos, even as a boy and a girl fall in love while another boy looks on. \nSides are chosen and betrayed, and many a promise is broken. The film is shot exceptionally well by Pankaj Kumar, mounted on a grand scale with finesse we in India are not used to, and some of the shots -- like one swirling up the inside of a grand old theatre, or the aerially shot war-sequences -- are glorious. \nAll this while Bhardwaj treats his film like a libretto, using songs with pointedly prickly Gulzar lyrics to underscore the narrative. \nBillimoria is a terrific character, a posturing prince who can't resist the grandiloquent gesture. \nPlayed by Saif Ali Khan, he comes across as an impeccably-heeled dandy intoxicated by his own insistence on his own power. \nEarly in the film, Julia -- repeating Billimoria's creed that the British are the best bosses for India -- is teased for being Russi's parrot, and, much later, Billimoria declares his love for Julia by saying she is the one within whom his life is imprisoned -- much like a parrot safeguarding an ogre's life in an ancient tale. Just who was Fearless Nadia? This idea of helplessness in love is what drives the love triangle in Rangoon , which sees all concerned parties nonchalantly express their lack of choice and resign all agency in the matter. \nThis may perhaps be why, even though the film has strong chemistry, the romance is less heady than it is matter of fact: We're supposed to take the characters' word for it. \nThey are in love because they say they are, and who are they to answer why? The heart -- bloody hell -- wants what it wants. \n'Is there anything greater than sacrificing one's life?' the characters ask. 'Yes,' answers the film. 'Yes. That who is worth dying for.' \nLiving on the brink of death is Nawab Malik, a valiant jamadar in the Indian Army with his focus unwavering from his mission. \nUntil, that is, Julia enters and mud-wrestles his concentration to the ground. \nA righteous man drawn to an impossible lover -- one who can throw knives and tantrums with equal panache -- he is flummoxed by this woman who declares herself untouchable but whom he must hold close. \nShahid Kapoor is perfect as Malik, duty-bound and clipped and proper even when barking orders in Japanese, giving this film a much-needed war footing. Lessons from Bollywood: Nail the vintage look! \nOther cast members worth applauding include Saharsh Shukla as Zulfi, Julia's fiercely loyal make-up man who risks his life to save her bags, and Tony-winning British actor Richard McCabe as the shayari -spouting Brit commander, Harding. \nAt one point, McCabe practices ghazals on a harmonium and, his mouth meticulously curling around beautiful words he loves so obviously, the scene reminded me of Chhabi Biswas and his singular obsession in Satyajit Ray's Jalsaghar . \nThis isn't likely to be a coincidence, for few things happen by chance in Bhardwaj movies. This one was originally conceived over a decade ago as an action movie about a Miss Julia -- a Fearless Nadia-esque foreign superstar -- who rode roughshod across Indian imaginations, and was set to star the one and only Uma Thurman. \nNow, many years on and in a different version of the film, with another actress having made the part entirely her own, Billimoria still calls Julia 'kiddo' -- which just happens to be Thurman's last name in the Kill Bill films. What inspired Rangoon ? Kangana Ranaut is Julia -- jagraati Julia, Julia worth staying nights up for, announce the lyrics as we meet her -- and the actress is extraordinary as she rides and throws and dances with aplomb in what is physically an immensely demanding part. \nRanaut looks like she knows how to actually crack a whip instead of just hurl one around, and acquits herself admirably in old-world stuntwoman sequences, all the while playing the part with enough vulnerability and insecurity to mark Julia out as a confused girl who doesn't quite know what she's doing. \nRanaut is lovely where she teases her friend in the back of a car or where she begs half-heartedly for mercy when pinned down by her lover, and despite so much going on in Rangoon , Bhardwaj and Ranaut make sure the film acts also as a coming-of-age story for Julia. \nThat said, this isn't the filmmaker at his finest. \nThe film feels longer than it is, some of the songs interfere with the too-meaty plot, and the romance never feels as soul-stirring as I assume it was intended to. \nThe climax is a bit of a tightrope walk that culminates in a fair few near-misses, and ends on a rather regrettable misstep. \nYet it is impossible to look away. \nRangoon haunts in unlikely fashion and, while the director's most straightforward picture, holds enough of its own marvels to justify multiple viewings. \nLike a song-and-dance troupe trampling all over a map of Europe to tell their own fractured, misguided jokes, or an old man cosily swilling wine after having faked his own death, Rangoon may be direct, but it is never obvious. \nAs the credits used to say back in the day at the close of a spectacular film, 'Remember, it's a Vishal Bhardwaj creation.' \nRediff Rating:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:39:19.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
