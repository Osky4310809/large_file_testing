(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) \nFor Cardinals reliever and U.S. Navy Reserve officer Mitch Harris, the threat of Tommy John surgery had little to do with its arduous rehab or even the months and months of recovery. \nIt was the likelihood he wouldn’t have reason to do either. \n“If I would have had Tommy John, I probably would not be standing here,” Harris said this past week at the team’s 21st annual Winter Warm-Up. “My whole thing is I’m going to play as long as I can play. I think that was the tough part to hear at first: ‘Hey, this could be it.’” \nHarris, 31, has already had his professional career delayed by military service and then derailed by a forearm injury that physicians traced back to a torn ligament in his right elbow. Reconstructive surgery last summer would have effectively cost Harris the 2017 season after he already had missed 2016 and wilted late in 2015. Baseball, by rule, doesn’t have such patience. Not for a reliever who is on the other side of 30. Or, as he and an official put it: “Time’s ticking.” A new surgical procedure offered him a chance to beat the clock. \nLike former Cardinals reliever Seth Maness, Harris went into surgery expecting Tommy John and left as one of three professional pitchers attempting to return after an alternative. Dr. George Paletta did a “primary repair” of Harris’ ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) at the bone and then constructed a protective sling out of tape to give the ligament support and protection as it healed. As a result, instead of missing 2017 and adding another 12 months to his absence, Harris intends to show the Cardinals he’s 100 percent, good to go, for spring. He will be throwing “high-intensity” bullpen sessions leading into spring training. \n“I gave Paletta a big hug,” Harris said. “It’s happening fast, but we’re excited with where we’re at. I would say I’m probably at 75 percent, even pushing 80. We are close. It’s just a matter of now getting those high-intensity bullpens.” \nHe’ll have to grab the team’s attention from the minor-league camp, he said. No longer on the 40-man roster, Harris did not receive an invite to major-league spring training. \nJust another challenge. \n“I have nothing to lose,” he said. \nThat was the sentiment he expressed to Dr. James Andrews and Paletta as they discussed the possible reasons for his discomfort and the treatments. Harris became the first U.S. Naval Academy grad to reach the majors in almost 100 years when he debuted in early 2015. He pitched 26 games for the Cardinals that summer, showed a 3.67 ERA and snatched two wins in relief. He was unavailable for the final series of that season because of soreness in his right forearm. The discomfort persisted during the next spring and the feel for his pitches faltered. After multiple tests and scans followed by second and third opinions the diagnosis isolated around his UCL. \nAs recently as two years ago, Tommy John would have been his only surgical option to repair the torn ligament. A new technique was used in 2013 and has had good results in high school and college pitchers. The alternative is a “primary repair,” or “UCL repair with internal brace construction.” The procedure involves anchoring the torn ligament to the bone and then constructing a scaffolding out of Arthrex tape to provide the ligament stability as it heals. To qualify for the surgery, a patient must have a tear at the bone — a tear in the middle of the ligament requires reconstruction — and the ligament must have good integrity. An overused or worn-thin ligament would require reconstructive surgery. \nDr. Jeffrey Dugas, a managing partner at the Andrews Sports Medicine & Orthopedic Center in Birmingham, Ala., has performed around 150 of these “primary repair” operations, he told the Post-Dispatch earlier this month. Only one has been on a professional pitcher. Dugas described how that’s the next leap for the procedure, but added that it could be two or more years before surgeons have enough data to use “primary repair” as a true alternative to Tommy John. The recoveries of Maness and Harris will be scrutinized for that reason. \nThe two pitchers have compared recoveries, kept in touch, and joked about how the surgery doesn’t have a name so it’s difficult to explain why they’re throwing so soon. \nDugas spoke in general terms about the surgery and suggested how he would consider the surgery for a professional pitcher if the tear was at the bone, the ligament integrity was solid, and if the recovery time for Tommy John was problematic for his career. \nHarris certainly fits the latter. \n“Last year was a tough year for him physically,” Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak said. “For him, he has to have a good camp. Unfortunately, his clock isn’t stopping. Well, no one’s is, for that matter.” \nHarris said the cause of the tear was probably the quantum leap he made from throwing whenever possible while on duty with the Navy — sometimes on the deck of a ship — to professional competition. A doctor likened it to a sprinter who had taken a few years off and then tried to run as fast as possible. There’s going to be an injury. In Harris’ case, the ligament had pulled off the bone. \nIn a roster bind for much of this winter, the Cardinals removed Harris from the 40-man roster and every other team in baseball had a crack at him. The Cardinals lost players Jeremy Hazelbaker, Tim Cooney and Dean Kiekhefer this past offseason through waivers, but Harris passed through without being claimed. Like the free agent Maness, Harris is listed as having elbow surgery, and for most that’s Tommy John and a 12-month absence. Having cleared waivers, Harris remained with the Cardinals, the only team he’s ever known, and he hopes to show he’s more prepared to compete than they know. \n“The team that took me when most other teams had no idea what was going to happen,” Harris said. “I love this organization. It’s kind of a two-way thing. No team picked me up because of the surgery. It was also a good thing (because) I’m still with the club that I want to be with.” Cardinals Update e-newsletter Cardinals Update from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nGet breaking news, features and the latest talk about the St. Louis Cardinals.
