Man-to-man, bro. I don’t care if you are [expletive] 14-years-old or not. I will punch you in your face, and when we go down to court, it’s your word against mine, and mine wins every time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:04:34.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
