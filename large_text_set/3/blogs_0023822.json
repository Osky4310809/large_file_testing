Gary Cameron/Reuters\nIvanka Trump will have her own office on the second floor of the West Wing, Politico reported on Monday. In addition to an office, Ivanka will also receive security clearance and government-issued communications devices this week.\nHowever, she will not be an official government employee. Ivanka will not be sworn in, she will not have an official title or position, and she won't receive a salary, her attorney, Jamie Gorelick, told Politico. She will function as President Trump's \"eyes and ears,\" her attorney said.\nGorelick did concede that Ivanka's elevation to the new role raises some ethical questions concerning her business interests. While she divested of significant assets, she retains ownership of her fashion and jewelry brand, though she stepped down before Trump assumed office.\n\"The one thing I would like to be clear on: we don't believe it eliminates conflicts in every way,\" Gorelick said. \"She has the conflicts that derive from the ownership of this brand. We're trying to minimize those to the extent possible.\"\nGorelick told Politico that Ivanka cannot sell her business because the buyer would be able to use her name, which could raise further ethical concerns. So instead, her lawyer said she will distance herself \"as much as possible\" from her brand and place her interests in a trust.\nIt will not, however, be a blind trust. Instead, her brother- and sister-in-law Josh Kusher and Nicole Meyer will control it. Josh Kushner's brother and Ivanka's husband, Jared, is a senior adviser to President Trump. Politico reports that though her brother-in-law and sister-in-law will control the trust, they will \"be prohibited from entering the brand into any agreements with foreign countries or agencies.\"\nAnd though the first daughter has appointed Abigail Klem to be president of her brand, Ivanka will still have veto power over any deals that are \"unacceptable from an ethics perspective.\"\nThis is not the first time that Ivanka Trump's brand has been ensnared in a grey area when it comes to mixing government business with personal and financial interests.\nShe is currently the defendant in a lawsuit brought by a San Francisco retailer who alleges that her the Ivanka Trump brand is capitalizing on Trump's presidency to further its business. Shortly after the election, her company landed in hot water after it promoted a bracelet she wore during an interview on \"60 Minutes.\"\nWhite House as QVC.

Instead, he has placed them in a trust controlled by his two sons, who are at the helm of the Trump Organization while their father is in the Oval Office.\nSpeaking about Ivanka Trump's move into the White House, ethics expert Norm Eisen, who served under former president Barack Obama, told Politico: \"You might be inclined to view this differently and more generously if the White House had shown a stronger commitment to ethics enforcement,\"\nSEE ALSO: Lawsuit claims Ivanka Trump exploited the 'power and prestige of the White House' NOW WATCH: Animated map shows which states are the biggest winners and losers from 'Trumpcare' Loading video...
