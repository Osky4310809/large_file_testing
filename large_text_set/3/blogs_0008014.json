Proprietors are also excluded. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releases closely-followed monthly data on nonfarm payrolls as part of its Employment Situation Report . The headline figure, the change in the total number of nonfarm payrolls compared to the previous month, is used as a gauge of economic health. \nIn February 2017, preliminary data shows that nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 235,000 to 145.8 million. The change marks the 77th straight month of job growth. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 238,000 in January (also preliminary) and 237,000 in February 2016. BREAKING DOWN 'Nonfarm Payroll' \nNonfarm payrolls are reported on the first Friday of the following month, with occasional exceptions, at 8:30 a.m. The data are used to assist policymakers and economists with determining the current state of the economy and predicting future levels of economic activity. Why the Nonfarm Payroll Report Matters \nThe major statistic reported from the nonfarm payroll report is the number of additional jobs added from the previous month. The report also contains many valuable insights into the labor force that have a direct impact on the stock market , the value of the U.S. dollar and the price of gold . The nonfarm payroll report is a major tool used to determine the overall health of the economy. The total nonfarm payroll accounts for approximately 80% of the workers who produce the entire gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States. \nThe nonfarm payroll report shows statistics of unemployment for the U.S workforce. This is communicated through an overall unemployment rate , a long term unemployment rate and a youth unemployment rate. The labor force participation rate is also a key statistic used to determine the true unemployment rate of the country. What the Nonfarm Payroll Reports \nStatistics from the nonfarm payroll also show which sectors are generating the most employment additions. The report shows large gains and losses among the sectors. The list of sectors from the report include professional and business services, health care, financial activities, mining, construction, manufacturing, wholesale trade , retail trade, transportation and warehousing , information, and leisure and hospitality. This breakdown by sector is often used by stock analysts to predict which stocks and sectors have strong earnings reports. \nThe report also contains additional items such as the average work week and average hourly earnings. Wage growth is communicated with the report. Each monthâ€™s report may include revisions to previous reports. \nThe best month for wage growth is usually May with an average of 129,000 additional jobs. August is the worst month with an average of 69,000 additional jobs. The year 1994 was the best on record with 3.85 million added jobs. That year saw gains reported in every monthly nonfarm payroll report. In 2009, the job force lost 5.05 million jobs, marking the worst statistical year for the nonfarm payroll.
