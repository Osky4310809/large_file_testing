Shares \nI'm not very good at platformers, but in spite of that I've been keeping a close eye on Rain World . I love the look of the lo-res post-apocalyptic setting, and Slugcat, the spear-wielding half-slug, half-cat creature who is \"both predator and prey in a broken ecosystem,\" is utterly adorable. Earlier this year it was slated for release sometime in 2017, and today publisher Adult Swim Games nailed that down to the pleasantly-soon March 28. \nTo mark the moment, Adult Swim also released a new trailer that ponders the fate of a Slugcat. \"Prey? Predator? As the old world dies, a new ecosystem evolves,\" the narrator says. \"In a land where even rain can kill, each creature struggles for its own survival. Each species has a place on the food chain, which it seeks to deny. And through this ruined landscape of strange monstrosities and ancient mysteries, Slugcat journeys. A search for shelter; a search for answers; a search for hope.\" \nPoetic, isn't it? It looks great, too, and it promises to be a pretty meaty experience: The Steam listing says it will have more than 1,600 rooms to explore, spread across 12 \"diverse regions.\" Find out more at adultswim.com , and enjoy some animated GIFs showcasing some the bizarre beauty and danger of Rain World right here .
