Associated Press/Alex Brandon\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is imposing a lifetime ban on administration officials lobbying for foreign governments, and a five-year ban for other lobbying.\nTrump used his executive authority Saturday to put in place the bans — fulfilling part of his campaign pledge to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington.\nTrump has said that those who want to work for him should focus on the job they'll be doing for the American people, and not on future income earned by peddling their influence after serving in government.\nAdministration officials describe the bans as historic in scope. But it's not immediately clear how they'd be enforced.\nTrump also took a separate action to restructure the National Security Council ask military advisers to prepare a plan to defeat the Islamic State group.\nMore from Associated Press: Rescuers search collapsed buildings in Italy after another powerful earthquake hits region near Perugia Texas Longhorns jump all the way up to No. 11 in latest AP poll after beating Notre Dame A college professor has promised to consume only water and sports drinks after the university's president overrode a nearly unanimous decision to grant him tenure Craig Sager is hoping to return to NBA sidelines by November after receiving a rare third bone-marrow transplant David Ortiz honored with a corn maze cut in his likeness NOW WATCH: Watch President Obama tear up while addressing Michelle in his farewell speech Loading video...
