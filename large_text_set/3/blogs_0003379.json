John Lowe in prison van as he arrives for his trial (Photo: Daily Mirror) \n“Police knew about Lowe and his threats to kill, yet decided the lives of chickens were more ­important than the lives of people.” \nLowe shot Christine and then Lucy at his puppy-breeding farm near Farnham, Surrey, in February 2014. \nHe told police he “put down” the pair because they had been “giving me sh**” for weeks. Lowe will die behind bars after being convicted at Guildford crown court of both murders . \nEleven months before the double killing, Stacy – Christine’s other daughter – told police Lowe pointed a gun at her and threatened “to blow my head off”. After three weeks, she told officers she did not want to support a prosecution due to his age.

The first stated his “livelihood” was suffering as a result of fox attacks. The second and third related to medical and financial matters. \nBut the IPCC found staff failed to properly review Lowe’s police file. A source revealed the report said they “may have committed a criminal offence”. However, the Crown Prosecution Service will take no action.

Stacy was given a suspended sentence. Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:55:11.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
