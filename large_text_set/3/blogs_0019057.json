They removed detection sensors from the fence that he jumped. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-0'); }); \nThe intruder, Jonathan Tran jumped three fences to get onto the grounds and to the door at the South Portico. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-0'); }); \nTran was able to scale that particular area of the fence without setting off alarms because they had been removed, leading to confusion among officers about his whereabouts and whether an intruder was inside the White House complex, the sources told the Examiner. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-1'); }); \n2. Why didn’t the dogs respond? They appear not to have been on the grounds, because they might ‘hurt someone.’ \nSome agents and officers also are questioning why Secret Service never released the K-9 unit to try to find an intruder after the alarms on the first fence the intruder scaled went off.[…] \nMost of the dogs the Secret Service uses are Belgian Malinois, a breed trained to detect and stop intruders of any kind. The agency is concerned about releasing the dogs too soon and possibly harming people and other animals but they are mostly muzzled so would not do lasting damage if let loose on the South lawn in order to find an intruder, the sources said. \nThey also had apparently been limited because of concern that they might hurt former President Barack Obama’s Portuguese water dog, Bo. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \n3. They didn’t actually even capture him after 17 minutes. He went to the South Portico door and said he had an appointment to the uniformed officer there. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nOn March 10, Tran was caught only when he strolled up to the back door and told the Uniformed Division officer posted there that he had an appointment with President Trump, the Examiner reported last week. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \nIn previous reports, the Secret Service was not forthcoming about Tran’s ability to elude them and did not disclose that he reached the back door. \nThis is the security that you provide the President of the United States with the number of radical lunatics running around out there? \nThis even after the intruder in 2014 was able to get into the house and supposedly changes were made? \nSomething has to change with the Secret Service and fast… googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:41:19.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
