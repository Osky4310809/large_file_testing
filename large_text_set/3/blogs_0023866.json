We’ve seen pink , rainbow and blorange hair take over the internet, and yesterday, we caught wind of the Pravana color-changing hair dye on Instagram. Basically, hair color just got 10 x's more interesting and we couldn’t be more excited. Professional hair color and product line Pravana teased their upcoming heat-activated color-changing hair dye in a video and here's what we know so far: it appears the hair color changes from a darker to lighter hue when the heat from a blow dryer is applied to the colored stands. This likely means that if you manage to get a gust of warm air on a hot, sunny day, your hair color will gradually change color and tone. Additionally, if you decide to flat iron or curl your hair, the heat from the tool will slowly change your hair color, too. Yeah, we're sold.
