Thirty-one-year-old Demarlon Thomas was sentenced to 19 years behind bars in 2008 for cocaine trafficking. He was arrested, along with over 30 other defendants, as part of a federal investigation \"Operation Sunset\" that effectively dismantled Saginaw‘s so-called Sunny Side Gang.

David Kaiser told The Saginaw News, adding that no one else was wounded in the shooting. Thomas' friend Carla Robinson told media that he was just happy to have a second chance at life and referred to himself as \"blessed\" on his return home. \"He's not the person that the media is painting a picture of,\" She said. \"He's not a hardcore gangbanger criminal. He was a caring person. He can't help the environment he was raised in.\" \nPolice are trying to find the killers, determine how they got into the halfway house and find out the motive for the shooting. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T02:55:47.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
