The moniker harks back to the cult duo Buckingham Nicks, which Lindsey and Stevie Nicks formed before joining Fleetwood Mac. \nThe singers told the LA Times that their new record should be released in May, with Buckingham commenting on the particular chemistry between the two: “All these years we’ve had this rapport, but we’d never really thought about doing a duet album before.” he said. \nMcVie added: “We’ve always written well together, Lindsey and I, and this has just spiralled into something really amazing that we’ve done between us.” \nThe partnership had been hinted at several months previously when drummer Mick Fleetwood told Rolling Stone that the pair “could probably have a mighty strong duet album if they want.” \nHowever the project is slightly more of a group affair than the title suggests – fellow Mac members bassist John McVie and Fleetwood are set to perform on it. This is despite the fact there is still no sign of the first Fleetwood Mac since 2003’s Say You Will . Fans had hoped that when McVie rejoined the band in 2014 following a 16 year break, there would be a new album – but securing time with Stevie Nicks, who has been concentrating on her solo career, has been the stumbling block. \nIn October last year, McVie told the Guardian that the album was “half-finished … it’s just seven tracks that we’ve got, and they’re only with guide vocals”. Talking of its “fantastic variety of songs” she said she hoped to finish the album before last Christmas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T13:16:06.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
