Where you’re not sure what you said, who you did and what you committed to, while under the influence? Yeah, those nights? Canadian tennis hottie Genie Bouchard just had one of those mornings. \nWe’re not sure what she was up to on Super Bowl Sunday, all we know is that she was watching the game, and like the rest of us, figured the Pats were done for.
