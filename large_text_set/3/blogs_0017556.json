This is like ’30s Germany.”\n“I don’t know what happened,” Allen, 63, continued. “If you’re not part of the group, ‘you know what we believe is right’ — I go, ‘Well, I might have a problem with that.’ ”\nThis isn’t the first time Allen has spoken out about his political beliefs. The comedian narrated an ad for GOP presidential hopeful John Kasich during the 2016 election and has also spoken positively about President Donald Trump .\nIn the interview on Friday, however, Allen hesitated before admitting that he attended Trump’s inauguration in January.\n“I was invited, we did a VIP thing for the vets, and went to a veterans ball, so I went to go see Democrats and Republicans,” he explained. “Yeah, I went to the inauguration.”\nFROM COINAGE: This Is How Much It Would Cost to Paint the White House (And More Crazy Facts) \n“I’m not attacking you,” Kimmel replied, laughing.\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack \nAllen also told Fox News host Megyn Kelly in November: “What I find odd in Hollywood is that they didn’t like Trump because he was a bully. But if you had any inkling that you were for Trump, you got bullied for doing that. And it gets a bit hypocritical for me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:17:38.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
