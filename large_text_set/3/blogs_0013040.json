We’ve spent years debunking this fiction, traveling across the country showing companies far and near just how happy a desk lunch can be if done with love. \nSomeone's encroaching on our turf, though. She goes by “Little Ye,” and, as of January , she’s a sensation on YouTube, with her videos circulating across Chinese social network Weibo. She's amassed a truckload of followers: 45,000 and counting. Advertisement \nHer videos hew to a similar narrative pattern: They usually begin with shots of office drones droning away at computers, silent and heads-down, before Little Ye gets to work. She scrounges around the office for any supplies she can find and turn into makeshift cooking tools, from clothes irons to Pepsi cans; computer casings become pancake friers. She preps noodles atop bunsen burners, prepping literal feasts, and her coworkers go on with their days as if nothing’s going on. \nImpressive, no? Really thought we had this Not Sad Desk Lunch thing down. Ugh. We’ve got to start upping our game!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T05:24:20.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
