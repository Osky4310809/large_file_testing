It's not going to be easy, given the fact that Cersei sits on it now and there will be many who try to get in her way , but she brings up an excellent point to her heartbroken lover Daario when discussing her strategy: she can marry. A marriage will provide Daenerys with a proper alliance that will get her even further, so that's great for strategy and all, but the matchmaker within me also got very excited about a potential wedding for Daenerys. There are a lot of eligible bachelors in Westeros right now, so we're pointing out who could end up marrying Daenerys in season seven . Get your roses ready to pass out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:10:05.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
