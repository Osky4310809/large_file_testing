In following up on multiple projects , Guwop is now setting his sights on the publishing world as he will soon be delivering his autobiography.\nCourtesy of publishing house Simon & Schuster, The Autobiography of Gucci Mane is set to arrive in September of this year. In a recent interview with collaborator Marilyn Manson for his CR Men’s Book cover story, Gucci revealed that he began writing the book during this three-year bid in an Indiana federal penitentiary.\n“When I was locked up and they put me in the hole, this is what I was doing to keep my sanity. This is how I was protecting myself,” he told Manson.\nThe Autobiography of Gucci Mane was written with Neil Martinez-Belkin, as you can pre-order your copy today. The book is due out on September 19.\nI'm an author now #TheAutobiographyOfGuccimane pic.twitter.com/vIGPMzQcOQ \n— Gucci Mane (@gucci1017) March 20, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:24:54.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
