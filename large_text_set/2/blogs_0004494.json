But you don't have to wait until Sunday to see it, because ET has the exclusive clip! In the video, Cookie wields a bat a la Beyonce's Lemonade , as she charges headfirst into her battle with Lucious Lyon for control of the family business. \"You built this company on my back,\" Cookie tells Lucious. \"And you want to erase me?\" While Lucious appears battered and bleeding in some shots, there are also quick looks of Lucious and Cookie in romantic embraces, foreshadowing a rollercoaster end to an already exciting season.
