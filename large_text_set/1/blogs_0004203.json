It doesn’t mean that all racial problems have gone away. It means that we have the capacity to get better.”\nFour people were charged with hate crimes on Thursday after they were allegedly caught on a Facebook Live video beating a tied-up mentally disabled teenager .\nFootage shows the suspects, who are black, repeatedly shouting obscenities about President elect-Donald Trump and about the victim being white. The victim, an 18-year-old man who has not been publicly identified, was forced to drink water out of a toilet and suffered at least one gash to his head after being bound and beaten for up to six hours, police said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:54:22.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
