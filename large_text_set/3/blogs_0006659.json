The Kim government has said that its missile launches were training for a strike on U.S. bases in Japan, according to The Washington Post . \nOn Wednesday, according to Korea Times, Pyongyang’s North Korean Central News Agency reported that the North Korean dictator had stressed “a need for preparation for a fight” during his visit to an army unit tasked with defending Pyongyang, adding that he had listed guidelines to strike South Korea and the U.S. “mercilessly.” \nAccording to the U.K. Daily Mail , U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis spoke on the phone to his South Korean counterpart Han Min-koo, saying that Washington remained “steadfast in its commitment” to Seoul.   \nThat commitment is coming in the form of advanced, and if necessary nuclear , technology that promises to make good on the promise of “dire consequences” should North Korea attack. \nThe aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson is on its way to join the Foal Eagle exercise, joining 300,000 South Korean troops and 15,000 US personnel. The Carl Vinson was carrying “24 F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, 10 S-3 Viking anti-submarine aircraft, four EA-6B Prowler tactical jamming aircraft and four E-2 Hawkeye early-warning planes,” according to the Daily Mail. \nAfter North Korea’s missile launch, the United Nations Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss additional security measures. Pyongyang is barred from the use of ballistic missile technology and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said on Twitter that the world “won’t allow” North Korea to continue on its “destructive path.” \nThings are getting real, but thankfully we have a president in the Oval Office who is up to the task.
