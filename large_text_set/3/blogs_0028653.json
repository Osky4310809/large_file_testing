Is Kendrick Lamar Taking Shots At Big Sean On \"The Heart Part 4\"? 5 1 1.6K Posted by Kevin Goddard , Mar 24, 2017 at 01:23am Kendrick Lamar is taking shots at somebody on \"The Heart Part 4,\" and twitter think its Big Sean. Kendrick Lamar just sent the internet a blaze Thursday night when he released the fourth installment in “The Heart” series, and while it's pretty certain he’s taking aim at unnamed artist in the second verse, the twittersphere thinks it’s Big Sean . \"My fans can't wait for me to son your punk ass and crush your whole lil shit/I'll Big Pun your punk ass you a scared lil bitch/Tip-toeing around my name nigga you lame/When I get at you homie don't just tell me you was just playin'/'I was just playing K.Dot c'mon you know a nigga rock with you bro'/Shut the fuck up you sound like the last nigga I know/Might end up like the last nigga I know/Oh you don't want to clash? Yeah nigga I know” Kendrick raps. Later on, K. Dot even says, “Hoe, Jay Z Hall of Fame, sit ya punk ass down,” which some think could be a reference to Big Sean’s second album Hall of Fame . Now this is all speculation at the moment, but people also thought that Sean took a couple jabs at K.Dot in his verse on “No More Interviews” last year, rapping “And I can’t lie like I like this shit like I usually do / And I’m just not impressed by you niggas rapping fast / Who sound like one big asthma attack but trash when I’m rapping it back / Who you put in your top five and claim they the savior of rap.” As Complex points, K. Dot also uses the word “lil” a couple times throughout the track, and also claims to \"Big Pun your punk ass,\" which could be a flip on Big Sean's name. For what it’s worth, some people think K Dot could be going at Drake too, but the lyrics & evidence looks to be aiming at Bg Sean. But then again, maybe we're reading in between the lines too closely? Take a listen to the record for yourself right here & let us know if you hear the Big Sean-shots.
