Advertisement \nDeadline reports that the CW released an extended version of a pep rally scene that will air during Riverdale on Thursday, featuring the reimagined version of “Sugar, Sugar.” The song was originally attributed to the cartoon band The Archies in 1969, with lead vocals from Ron Dante, and stayed at Number 1 on the Billboard 100 for four weeks. The video for it, which aired on The Archie Show, is extremely trippy: \nThe modern “Sugar, Sugar,” vocalized by Riverdale star Ashleigh Murray, is a cover of Inner Circle’s “ Candy Girl (Sugar Sugar) ” from 2009, featuring Flo Rida. The CW’s take lands somewhere in between the two stylistically. \nThe reboot has, so far, played up the campy murder and predatory teacher side of the series in promos , so it’s nice to see some of the cuter, more wholesome aspects of Riverdale come out. Like songs produced for completely fictional bands that make you want to clap your hands.
