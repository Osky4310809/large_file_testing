Bruce Rauner on Friday, March 3, 2017. (Photo: Ashlee Rezin, AP) 296 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nChance the Rapper met with Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner Friday, seeking answers about funding for Chicago Public Schools, which have suffered extensive budget cuts and closures. Instead, the artist just seems to have walked away with more questions. \n\"I thought that that went a little different than it should have,\" an admittedly \"flustered\" Chance told reporters outside of the James R. Thompson Center in the heart of Chicago’s downtown. \n\"I’m here because I just want people to do their jobs,\" explained the Coloring Book artist, who reached out to Rauner about a sit-down after the governor congratulated him on his recent Grammy wins . \"I asked him about funding CPS with that $215 million that was discussed in May of last year and was vetoed in December.\" (The Republican governor, who is currently in a two-year budget stalemate with Democratic lawmakers, vetoed the plan to allot $215 million to Chicago Public Schools after he said Democratic leaders \" publicly reneged \" on a pension reform measure to slash state employee retirement costs.) \n\"It sounded like we were going somewhere but it sounds like it’s hinged on passing other bills,\" Chance continued, adding, \"I’m not a politician. I’m here because I’m a dad. I’m an after-school teacher. I care about the kids.\" \nPer the Chicago Tribune , Rauner said the two \"had a discussion about education and education funding\" and that Chance was \"very focused on getting quickly more money for CPS right now, and I share his passion.\" \nChance acknowledged Rauner had taken his personal number but said the governor gave him \"vague answers\" on the funding issue. \"We'll see what happens,\" he told reporters before putting the onus on media outlets to better contextualize the budget crisis and the need for equitable education funding in their coverage. \n(Warning: This video contains explicit language.) . @chancetherapper not very happy about his meeting w/ @GovRauner on public schools.\"Do your job...give a history of how we ended up here.\" pic.twitter.com/W3geRrpfDL — #AllofUs (@TimeForAllofUs) March 3, 2017 \n\"If all your publications that you guys work for and the international, national publications out there — Complex , Billboard , people that, you know what I'm saying, post about me walking down the street and (expletive) — if you guys could give a comprehensive history on how we ended up here, that would be helpful,\" he said. \nThe artist later tweeted that he did not want Friday's meeting to be interpreted as a loss. \"Chicago Public Schools and I did not lose today,\" he wrote . \"Please don't let that become the narrative. Monday morning, I'll have a plan.\" 296 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T06:56:54.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
