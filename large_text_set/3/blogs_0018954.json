Is Drake Going At Kid Cudi On \"Free Smoke\"? 0 3 3 Posted by Kevin Goddard , Mar 21, 2017 at 10:02pm Fans online think Drake is taking aim at Kid Cudi on the intro track of \"More Life.\" At 22 songs, Drake ’s record-shattering More Life album has seen its fair share of subliminal disses throughout it. On the tracks “Free Smoke”&“Lose You,” Drake appears to take a couple shots at arch rival Meek Mill , and on the outro “Do Not Disturb,” the 6 God aims some bars at his fellow Toronto foe Tory Lanez, but that doesn’t look to be all however. Thanks to social media & there devotion to breaking down every lyric of Drake’s album, there’s a theory going around online that the 6 God took a shot at former G.O.O.D Music rapper Kid Cudi , who called him out back in September for not being loyal. On the intro track “Free Smoke,” Drake raps “Please come outside the house and show yourself/So I can say it to your face” which is a reference to Cudi’s tweet last year calling out Drake : “Say it to face, pussy. You think it’s a game. I wanna see you say it to my face. I’ll be out soon. Promise.” That tweet in itself was in response to “Two Birds, One Stone,” a Drake song that seemed to respond to Cudi. Later in the track (“Free Smoke”), Drake also raps, “Y’all keep playing with ya nose, yeah/You get high and the do the most, yeah,” which is another line that people are taking as a shot at Cudi’s drug use. Now of course, this could be just fans over dissecting the lyrics, but then again Drizzy is one the best at subliminal's, so it's probably a little dig at Cudi if you ask me. Revisit the track for yourself right here , and let us know what you hear? (Below, our some of the reactions from people on twitter.) Should Cudi respond or just keep it moving? Im a @KidCudi fan. Die hard. Yall wouldn't understand. That's my college life in music form. Drake cant be dissing my homie lol", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:15:42.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
