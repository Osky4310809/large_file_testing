But when you’re working in law enforcement, law enforcement should know no politics.” \nLikewise, Claude Arnold, a former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent in charge of Homeland Security investigations said the decision boded ill for San Francisco residents.   \n“There is less chance of uncovering networks, plots, missing pieces of a puzzle, without cities participating in the JTTF,” Arnold explained. \nAccording to KGO-TV , San Francisco had a 10-year agreement with the FBI that expired this month. \nBut civil liberties advocates don’t believe there’s ever any need to work with the feds when it comes to anti-terrorism. \nAttorney and civil rights advocate John Crew said that President Trump’s temporary travel ban from seven countries also played a role in the decision to cut ties with the FBI.
