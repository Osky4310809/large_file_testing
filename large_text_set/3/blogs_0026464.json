Carlos Curbelo (R-FL) asking the congressman to protect the Affordable Care Act from being repealed in Miami. \nThey really don't like this bill — and are ready to punish members of Congress who vote for it. \nA whopping 56 percent of U.S. voters disapprove of the Republican plan to repeal and replace key parts of Obamacare — and just 17 percent support the bill that is headed for a do-or-die vote Thursday, a new poll shows. \nThe Quinnipiac University poll also reveals that 46 percent of voters say they will be less likely to vote for their U.S. Senator or congressman if they vote for the GOP replacement plan. \nA mere 19 percent said they would be more likely to vote for their lawmakers under that scenario. Another 29 percent said the vote of their legislators would not matter. \nThe poll also found that one out of every seven Americans believes they will lose their health insurance if the bill becomes law. \n\"Replacing Obamacare will come with a price for elected representatives who vote to scrap it, say many Americans, who clearly feel their health is in peril under the Republican alternative,\" said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll. \nThe poll was released Thursday, just hours before a scheduled vote on the embattled bill by the full House of Representatives. \nThe bill is being heavily promoted by President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress. \nBut it has been opposed by a number of more-conservative Republican lawmakers and think tanks, who say it does not go far enough in repealing the Affordable Care Act. \nReflecting that intra-party schism, the Quinnipiac poll found that only 41 percent of the Republican voters who were surveyed supported the GOP bill, with 24 percent opposing it. \nJust 29 percent of all voters polled approved Trump's handling of health-care issues, with 61 percent disapproving of it. \nHalf of all voters support a partial repeal of Obamacare. But just 20 percent support a full repeal, and 27 percent said the law should not be fully repealed. \nThe GOP bill, entitled the American Health Care Act, would repeal Obamacare taxes, get rid of the requirement that most people have health coverage or face a fine, and scale back the subsidies for private individual health plans and federal Medicaid funding that are key components of the current health-care law. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 24 million more people would lack health insurance by 2026 if the bill becomes law than would be the case if Obamacare continued in its present form. \nThe Quinnipiac poll found that 85 percent of voters said it is \"very important\" for health insurance to be affordable to Americans. Another 13 percent said that was \"somewhat important.\" \nThe poll, which was conducted over the past week, surveyed 1,056 voters, and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:30:26.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
