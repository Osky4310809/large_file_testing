Did I miss any reasons? Watch the video and let me know!\nIt's Valentine's Day today. We're less than two weeks away from the BlackBerry Mobile's unveiling of the Android-powered, keyboard-rocking BlackBerry \"Mercury\" . I'm excited for it. To be honest though, for the last couple of years my smartphone daily driver has typically been a full touchscreen phone. Suffice to say I'm now pretty fast at typing on glass.\nTyping speed is only one factor of the smartphone typing experience though. In this video I highlight 7 (maybe 8!) reasons why physical keyboards on smartphones still reign supreme for overall typing experience. Be sure to watch and see if you agree with my opinions. Did I miss anything? If so, let me know!\nI hope you enjoy the video! And if you do, I really do appreciate any Shares and Thumbs Ups you can give to the video on YouTube (that'll help re-kickstart our channel a bit), and if you're not subscribed then PLEASE SUBSCRIBE! The more people who watch them the more we'll make! Be sure to turn on notifications so you don't miss any!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:08:47.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
