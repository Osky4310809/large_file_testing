The decision impacts travelers from these countries for at least 90 days even if they have valid visas or permanent residence permits. \nInterpretation of the order has evolved since the order's signing. For instance, agencies changed position on whether green card holders from these countries were or weren't covered by the executive order. As of Sunday, the government says it will try to ease this group's entry into the country, provided the traveler has no criminal background or terrorist ties. \nFriday’s order also suspended a visa waiver interview program that made it easier for frequent travelers (including tourists and businesspeople) from 38 nations (countries such as Australia, France and Iceland) to come to the United States. With the interview waivers suspended, this group will need formal one-on-one interviews at U.S. embassies to renew their authorizations, slowing travel. \nBusinesses -- including some of tech’s biggest names -- responded to the order with dismay and shock. Some worried that the chaos seen at airports across the country this weekend would find its way to the technology sector, stifling innovation and the flow of ideas as the inconsistently interpreted order made it harder to predict who can enter or leave the United States. Some founders called the ban immoral or un-American while others offered ways to help both refugees and their own workers and families. Still others, some on special advisory boards with the new administration, offered to find ways to fix the situation. \nHere are a sampling of their reactions. 1 / 8 Reed Hastings, CEO, Netflix: Ban \"Un-American\" \nThe top exec at the streaming media company said, \"Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. A very sad week, and more to come with the lives of over 600,000 Dreamers here in a America under imminent threat. It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.\" 2 / 8 Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook: Let’s focus on real threats \nThe social media exec said he was concerned about the order’s impact and if it helped more than it hurt. He said, “We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation.” 3 / 8 Tim Cook, CEO, Apple: Workers have our support \nIn a letter to employees, Cook wrote that the order was \"not a policy we support.\" The company acknowledged the many employees who could be impacted by it and promised the company’s assistance. \"We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company.\" \nHere is the full text of the email, first published on Buzzfeed. \nTeam, \nIn my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I’ve made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration — both to our company and to our nation’s future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. \nI’ve heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support. \nThere are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday’s immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them. We’re providing resources on AppleWeb for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company. \nAs I’ve said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there’s one thing I know about the people at Apple, it’s the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It’s as important now as it’s ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued. \nApple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe. \nIn the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, “We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.” \nTim 4 / 8 Jack Dorsey, CEO, Twitter: “Economic impact is real” \nTwitter’s CEO followed the story throughout the weekend on his personal account, saying the ban was \"upsetting\" and reminding followers that many Syrian immigrants are small business owners. \n\nThe Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S. https://t.co/HdwVGzIECt \n\n\n11% of Syrian immigrants to the U.S. are business owners, more than triple that of U.S.-born business owners https://t.co/cU9UMKcG4r", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T12:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T07:15:34.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
