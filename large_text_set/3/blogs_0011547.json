I want to get back to that. \n“I still believe I’ve got a future at Liverpool. I’m not thinking about moving on. You have to be confident in your own ability and I’m ready for the fight.” \nFlanagan added ahead of a Premier League clash between his parent club and loan employers that will see him ineligible for selection: “I’ve got a job to do for Burnley until the end of the season but after that I want to go back and prove what I’m all about at Liverpool. \n“One of my greatest strengths is my self-belief. What I’ve done in the past is change people’s opinions of me and force my way into a very good Liverpool team. \nLiverpool team news & likely line-up \n“I’ve shown that I can perform at the highest level. I am more than confident of doing the same again. I still feel like I’ve got a lot to offer. I am really excited and looking forward to the challenge.” \nFlanagan made his senior debut for Liverpool in April 2011, but has only been able to take his appearance tally to 50 in all competitions across the five seasons which have followed.
