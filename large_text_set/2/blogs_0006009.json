Klopp is preparing for a clash against Hull (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty) \nThe German has been on the losing side on just one occasion against the rest of his top-six rivals in 15 attempts since his arrival midway through the 2015-16 season. But this season Liverpool have already lost to Burnley, Swansea, and Bournemouth. \n“We are working with human beings and things like that happen but for me the most important thing is that we know how to play them – now we have to show it all the time,” said Klopp. \nBut the Kop boss admitted that it often comes down to game management and a slightly cynical approach – which allows teams like Conte’s to play on the edge of sportsmanship to get results. Klopp says he must be more like Conte in certain situations (Photo: Clive Mason) \nThe German said: “We need more game management. Everyone talks about our intensity but sometimes when we run like devils I have to say ‘come on, please cool down,’ like Chelsea would do at 2-0 up or, when Conte was in Turin, 1-0 up. He would change things and put on an extra defender. That is a mentality. \n“Give us the time for this. There is a moment when you must think ‘let them come and we will counter-attack.’ \n“We have to develop a few things.” David Luiz netted the opener against Liverpool...
