the country in opposition to Donald Trump's immigration orders, breaking his silence on political issues for the first time since leaving office. \nA spokesman for Mr Obama's said he \"fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion\". \nIn his first statement on behalf of the former president, Kevin Lewis said Mr Obama was \"heartened\" by the amount of engagement taking place in US communities. \nMr Lewis, a former White House official, pointed out that Mr Obama used his last official speech as president to talk about Americans' responsibility to be \"guardians of our democracy,\" even in non-election years. \nFormer president: It is the first time Obama has commented since Donald Trump took office \n\"Citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble, organise and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake,\" Mr Lewis said. \nMr Lewis did not specifically invoke President Trump's immigration order. \nBut he rejected comparisons between Mr Trump's recent actions and Mr Obama's foreign policy decisions.

Thousands march to Downing Street in protest at Trump's travel ban \nMr Lewis's comments mark the first time Mr Obama has weighed in on President Trump's actions since he left office on January 20. \nIn his final weeks as president, Mr Obama said he planned to follow George W Bush's example by giving his successor room to govern without being second-guessed. \nYet Mr Obama pointedly reserved the right to speak out if President Trump violated what Mr Obama called basic American values. \nHe suggested a ban on Muslims or a move by President Trump to deport immigrants brought to the US illegally as children would cross that threshold.
