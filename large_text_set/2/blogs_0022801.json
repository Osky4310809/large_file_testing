Really? \nThey were the words Tweeted by Leicester City fan Gary Lineker when the Italian was announced Foxes boss back in July 2015. \nRanieri made him eat his words, and present BBC Match of the Day in his pants 10 months later, when he steered his side to their first Premier League title. \nOn Thursday the club announced the Italian had been sacked as manager - the result of a difficult second season. Claudio Ranieri's time at Leicester City will go down in history (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nThey currently sit one point and a single place above the drop zone, and look certain to be battling for their top-flight status going into the business end of the season. \nIn the above video we have compiled a timeline of the Italian's career as Foxes boss, where he fought to win fans over, brought them unimaginable success, and was relieved of his duties. \nRanieri demonstrated his passion for perfection early on in his tenure as manager of the club. Gary Lineker presents Match of the Day in his pants (Photo: BBC) \nHe guided the Foxes to second in the Premier League table in September 2015, but wanted more - he wanted a first clean sheet - and bribed his players with pizza to help them achieve it. \nBy the end of November his team were sitting pretty at the top of the table after a 3-0 win over Newcastle. A game later and Jamie Vardy had broken a record - scoring in 11 successive games. \nAs winter arrived Ranieri was continually asked whether his side could continue their sensational form. He toyed with the idea but ensured he wasn't getting carried away.
