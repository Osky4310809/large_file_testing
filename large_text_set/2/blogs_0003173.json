UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 22 hours ago 2 \nIn a subsequently-deleted tweet, Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus said the band will be releasing new music in April. \nIn a recent Twitter Q&A, the musician was asked by a fan \"when are my headphones gonna be blaring new and beautiful music of yours? Cuz I need new songs to memorize,\" to which he replied (via Alt Press ): \n\"I believe it's April now.\" \nReleased in July 2016 as the band's first album in 5 years, the latest Blink record \" California \" is still pretty fresh, hence new music within just 9 months isn't something that most fans would consider likely. Anyhow, stay tuned for updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T15:26:00.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
