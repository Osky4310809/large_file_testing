He's a way better singer than me. It was just always – it was always different.\" \nHow nice of him to say that! \nOn the other hand, Aaron addressed the lack of support he was given on radio when he was younger, although he's quick to point out that he's still sold more records than Justin: \n\"When I was younger, I was looked at as taboo. ‘This little kid that looks like a girl singing, you want us to have him on our radio station? You're crazy, hell no.' …I was never a radio artist. Ever. But somehow I sold even more records even to this day still than Justin Bieber.\" \nReally? We might need a fact check on that one. \nAnd when asked if he would ever do a duet with Justin as part of his comeback, Aaron said, \"absolutely not.\" \nMeanwhile, Biebsy is too busy trolling The Weeknd to pay attention to this feud.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:43:58.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
