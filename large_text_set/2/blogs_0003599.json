Airplanes, elephants and lions -- Kourtney Kardashian has shared an inside peek at her youngest son, Reign’s, stylish little digs! The reality star posted photos on her app on Monday, showing the cute bedroom, which was pimped out by interior decorator Martin Lawrence Bullard. WATCH: Kourtney Kardashian Gives Inside Look at Daughter Penelope’s Super Cute Bedroom In addition to a rocking horse-style elephant and stuffed animals, like the 2-year-old cutie’s favorite lion, the bright and airy room also features a daybed. “I love having a daybed in this space, so I can sleep here when Reign is sick or needs me,” Kourtney wrote. “I slept in his room the first three months of his life (most nights with Mason and Penelope in the room, too), so a full-size daybed is amazing.” A giant, white fur rug is laid out in the “cozy space,” and above the bed lies a gift from Reign’s older brother, Mason. “This vintage airplane was in Mason’s old room,” shared Kourtney . “When we moved, he wanted to give it to Reign, so we mounted it on the wall.” Photo: www.kourtneykardashian.com Photo: www.kourtneykardashian.com The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star previously gave fans a glimpse of her daughter, Penelope’s, pretty pink bedroom. The space featured Hello Kitty décor and a vintage clothing rack for Penelope’s dolls’ clothes. While there’s obviously nothing like home sweet home for the family, the mom of three headed out to celebrate Super Bowl Sunday with her famous friends over the weekend. As well as hanging with her sister Khloe’s ex-boyfriend, French Montana -- who appeared on her Snapchat saying, “Khloe whatup,” -- Kourtney also caught up with Diddy. \"When I need good vibes, this is who I call. When I need to feel good about myself, this is who I call,\" she said about the rapper on Snapchat. \"Yeah! Queen right here,” replied Diddy, who is recovering from a knee operation on Thursday.
