It’s pathetic.” \nPDVSA head, Ysmel Serrano says the internal shipping problems will be solved soon, saying, “we’re strengthening deliveries to the center of the country to stabilize gasoline supplies.” \nBut while Serrano is asking for calm and optimism, one union leader is saying that problems are a lot worse than the state-controlled company head is letting on. Ivan Freites, a union leader and prominent critic of the state-run oil company, said refineries only had oil inventories for two days compared with a standard of 15. \nAccording to The Associated Press , analysts say the Venezuelan petroleum market, PDVSA especially, has been hit by the continued falling oil prices, causing financial and operational difficulties. \nPDVSA isn’t the only Venezuelan state-run company facing financial difficulties. Venezuela’s government has a controlling interest in over 500 companies, and 70 percent of them are losing money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:02:40.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
