The ASUS branded OnHub now costs $129, $70 off the regular price, and the TP-Link OnHub comes in at $145, $54 off the normal asking price.\nThe routers’ chief purpose is to deliver faster and more consistent Wi-Fi throughput, in a more intuitive package. They offer speeds up to 1900 mbps, come with 13 powerful antennas to reduce the number of dead zones in a household/office, and support more than 100 simultaneous connected devices. What’s more, they work with the Google Wi-Fi App for Android and iOS so you can control your network with your phone.\nSee also: Super Mario Run is now live on Google Play 13 hours ago Of the pair of wireless routers, the ASUS version is the more modern, it arrived a number of months after the original TP-Link unit and offers some additional “wave control” gestures. Both have been superseded by the Google Wi-Fi router from last year, but they’re still capable products and work with the Google Wi-Fi mesh network if you want to use one as an additional access point.\nIf you’re interested in these, check out the ASUS OnHub at the Google Store here , and the TP-Link OnHub here . Google hasn’t mentioned a time-frame for the price cuts, so it’s possible that these have been dropped indefinitely to clear stock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T12:40:12.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
