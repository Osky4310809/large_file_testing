The Trinidad native has had numerous plastic surgery operations, changing his nose, cheekbones and chin just to look more like the late King of Pop. WATCH: Michael Jackson Is Getting the Lifetime Movie Treatment \"I used to work for him as a decoy, and I performed at his birthday parties,\" Navi told ET's Nischelle Turner. \"Even when he went through the trials, I stood outside the courthouse and I stood there with a sign that said, 'Smooth but not a criminal.' To me it was important that I wanted Michael to know I believe in him.\" The TV movie, based on the bestselling book Remember the Time , will focus on the last three years of Jackson's life, as told through the eyes of his two bodyguards, Bill Whitfield and Javon Beard. Jackson's 18-year-old daughter Paris previously voiced her distaste for the now-canceled episode of Sky Arts' Urban Myths series centered on a road trip Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando reportedly took. Paris took issue with Joseph Fiennes' portrayal of Jackson, calling it \"shameful.\" She has kept silent on Lifetime's upcoming movie, and while she has been invited to the set, Paris hasn't visited.
