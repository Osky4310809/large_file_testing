The pact involved 12 countries bordering the Pacific Ocean, including Mexico, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Chile and Peru. It would have gradually eliminated as many as 18,000 different tariffs on goods traded among the countries, and promised cooperation on broader employment practices. \n“I think it’s calamitous for California,” said Jock O’Connell, a Sacramento economist and international trade consultant. He said the TPP would have helped California farmers, tech and biotech manufacturers, the film and music industries and other exporters. \nThe almond industry is among those that could lose business as a result, he said. Sacramento’s Blue Diamond Growers, a major almond cooperative, is one of the region’s largest employers. Blue Diamond officials weren’t immediately available for comment. \n“It’s hard to see where the good news is for California,” O’Connell said. \nCalifornia in 2015 exported $69 billion worth of goods to the countries involved in the TPP, including $27 billion to Mexico and $17 billion to Canada, according to the latest data from the U.S. Commerce Department. On the other hand, California imported $146 billion worth of goods from TPP countries. \nComputers and electronics good represent the largest exports from California to the 11 countries participating in TPP. For example, California sent $16 billion worth of computers and electronics to Canada, Mexico, Japan, Singapore and Australia in 2015, according to the Commerce Department. \nConcerns over Trump’s move were strong at companies such as Ensemble Designs Inc., a Nevada City company that makes high-tech equipment for television broadcasters. Half of its sales go overseas, and the 45-employee company has strong connections to TPP countries such as Japan and Malaysia. \n“If the United States shifts toward a more restrictive and less open trade stance, that’s going to have an adverse effect,” said Chief Executive David Wood. “It’s going to slow things down.” \nSung Won Sohn, an economist at California State University, Channel Islands, said imports and exports create tens of thousands of California jobs. Killing TPP “will mean fewer jobs, everything from truck drivers to longshoremen,” he said. \nTrump has also signaled that he will attempt to renegotiate NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the signature trade agreement signed by President Bill Clinton, which lowered trade barriers with Mexico and Canada. Trump has said NAFTA has crippled U.S. manufacturing. \nAlthough it’s far from clear how NAFTA might change, Sohn said it’s likely it will result in a curtailment in the flow of goods across borders. Renegotiating NAFTA could help prop up some low-wage manufacturing industries, such as clothing, but would likely hurt high-wage manufacturing in industries such as computers. \nA slowdown in trade could make things particularly tough for California farmers, who shipped $21 billion worth of products overseas in 2015. That represented more than one third of the $54 billion California crop, according to the Department of Food and Agriculture. \nJapan bought $1.6 billion worth of California farm goods in 2015, led by almonds, rice and beef. Mexico bought $1.2 billion of California’s farm exports. \nTim Johnson of the California Rice Commission said the cancellation of TPP won’t be a major headache so long as the Trump administration pursues trade deals with specific countries, such as Japan, a major customer of California’s rice crop. \nHe noted that Trump’s campaign opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, had come out in opposition to TPP as well. \n“It was clear that TPP was facing strong headwinds regardless of who was successful (in the election),” Johnson said. \nCalifornia 2015 imports and exports to TPP signatories \nCountry", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:31:55.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
