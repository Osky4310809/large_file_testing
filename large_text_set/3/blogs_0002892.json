(Source: PTI) \nIn another political attack in Kerala, 3 RSS activists got injured in an alleged attack by CPI (M) workers at a village near Koyilandy in the Kozhikode district. The news was confirmed by the district police who have identified the victims. Local police told that all the victims were in their 20s and suffered multiple injuries in head, head and legs. The attack took place late night at the Keezhaiyur village and all the three men have been admitted to the Medical College Hospital. \nPolice are currently investigating the matter and are trying to find out the people who were behind this act. However, the local police confirmed that no one has been arrested in connection with the attack so far. Kerala has been witnessing a series of political clashes between cadres of BJP -RSS and ruling CPI(M), especially in the Northern Kannur district, for a long time. Both parties have blamed each other for the cycle of violence, which has claimed several lives on both sides. \nYou may also want to watch: \nOn Thursday, a similar attack happened in the state near Nadapuram when four RSS workers were injured after some people hurled a crube bomb at the RSS office. This incident took place at Kallachi and the police identified injured people as Babu, Vineesh, Sudhir and Sunil. \nThese attacks have taken place after RSS leader Kundan Chandravat announced a bounty of Rs 1 crore for beheading the Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Ujjain district Superintendent of Police Manohar Verma said, “We booked Chandravat yesterday under IPC section 505 (1) (B) (whoever makes any statement with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquility).”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T08:07:37.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
