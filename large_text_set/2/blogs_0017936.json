Derrick Stevens, awaits his cue to hoist the officer flag at the annual commemoration ceremony recognizing the flag-raisings on Iwo Jima in 1945. Marines - past and present - attended the ceremony, Feb. 23, 2010, in remembrance of the historic World War II battle at the Marine Corps War Memorial, Arlington, Va. The ceremony honored the sacrifices of the Marines and sailors who fought the epic battle and the fallen Marines of all wars, to whom the memorial is dedicated. US Marines Raised The Flag On Iwo Jima 72 Years Ago TOP 5497814 \nSix U.S. service members raised the U.S. flag on Mt. Suribachi during the Battle for Iwo Jima 72 years ago Thursday, which was captured in the Pulitzer Prize winning iconic photo by Joe Rosenthal. \nThree of the Marines photographed were killed in the following days of the battle. The photo was widely hailed in the U.S. and has become a symbol of the U.S. effort in World War II and the U.S Marine Corps. The photo was later memorialized in 1954 at the U.S. Marine Corps Memorial in Arlington, Va. The flag is raised above the Marine Corps War Memorial during a wreath laying ceremony Feb. 23, 2011, to honor the 66th anniversary of the flag raising on Mt. Suribachi during the battle of Iwo Jima. Marines, veterans and guests gathered to honor an event, which lifted the hope of a nation at war during the heat of the Second World War. \nThe photo engendered some controversy in the summer of 2016 after the U.S. Marine Corps admitted it had misidentified one of the men in the photo. The misidentified man, Navy corpsman John Bradley, rose again to international fame after his son wrote a best-selling 2000 book detailing his father’s role in the battle.

Schulz’s family told The New York Times, he only mentioned his role a few years before he died. When his step-daughter heard the news she reportedly told him, “my gosh, Harold, you’re a hero,” to which replied “no, I was a Marine.” \nSend tips to [email protected] Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
