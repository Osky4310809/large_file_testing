Justin Tucker hit a 75-yard field goal during practice at the Pro Bowl. (AP) \nI know, I know, it’s a lot easier to hit a long field goal with no defense pressuring you or trying to block it up the middle. \nBut can we put that aside for a moment and agree that the video posted by Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker from the Pro Bowl is really cool? \nTucker, at a Pro Bowl practice in Orlando, hit a 75-yard field goal and put the video on Twitter. From 75 in sunny Orlando! Shoutout to #RavensFlock !! pic.twitter.com/QYaxVw7FML \n— Justin Tucker (@jtuck9) January 25, 2017 \nNot too bad. The NFL record for a field goal in a game is 64 yards by Matt Prater, though it would be hard to bet against Tucker breaking that if he got a shot at it. \nTucker took over this year as the undisputed best kicker in football. He made 38-of-39 field-goal attempts, including all 10 from 50 yards or more, and didn’t miss an extra point. \nTucker said last year he could make an 84-yard field goal in optimal conditions in the thin air of Denver, and while that sounds dubious, now we know he can hit from 75 yards out in practice.
