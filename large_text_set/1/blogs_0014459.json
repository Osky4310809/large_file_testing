Bush explains why he has to skip Trump's inauguration Stumble \nFormer President George H.W. Bush told President-elect Donald Trump that he has to skip the inauguration on Friday because sitting outside during the winter would be too risky to his and his wife’s health. \n“Barbara and I are so sorry we can’t be there for your inauguration on January 20th,” Bush wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump last week, which surfaced Wednesday. \n“My doctor says if I sit outside in January, it likely will put me six feet under,” he wrote. “Same for Barbara, So I guess we’re stuck in Texas.” \nBush said that the former president and former first lady will be there “in spirit” and offered to help if he ever needs it. \nCoincidentally, Bush has been hospitalized since Saturday for shortness of breath , his spokesman Jim McGrath confirmed Wednesday on Twitter. Bush suffers from a form of Parkinson’s disease and in 2015, he spent a week in a Maine hospital after falling and breaking a bone in his neck. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
