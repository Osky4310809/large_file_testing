LOUIS • Lawyers for a local entrepreneur facing a kidnapping charge say that police provided him enough alcohol to get him drunk while he was in their custody, and also denied him legal counsel. \nBut those agents and police denied that in court Thursday, saying that when former BAM Brands executive Todd Beckman asked to get a “drink,” they assumed he meant water, not vodka. \nThe back-and-forth was part of hearing on a motion to suppress evidence and testimony in the case filed by Beckman's lawyers. \nBeckman and four others were indicted on federal charges in December and accused of a role in the kidnapping of a Maplewood man over a drug debt . He was freed after his parents paid $27,000, charging documents say. \nUntil recently, Beckman was president and chief executive officer of BAM Brands, which owns Tanco, Xist Fitness, Massage Luxe and “age management company” LifeXist. \nIn court filings and in court, Beckman lawyer Travis Noble has argued that Beckman talked about a lawyer and repeatedly referenced Noble while waiting to be formally interviewed after his Dec. 1 arrest. \nBut Brandon McKinnon, a Maryland Heights officer detached to the DEA, said they were only talking about a prior DWI case, and Noble's skill with those kinds of cases. If Beckman had asked for Noble or any other lawyer, all questioning would have stopped, he said. \nLater, in a three-hour interview with Maplewood police, Beckman agreed to talk. In snippets of the recorded interview that were played in court, Beckman says that “my attorneys would get all pissed off if this goes further,” but implies that he is talking because he did not orchestrate the kidnapping or tie up and assault the victim. \nHe says when he found out what happened, he responded, “What the (expletive) did you guys do this for?” \n“I told you don't hurt that kid,” he says on the tape. \nBeckman later says, “I'd have (noted local lawyer Scott) Rosenblum in here right now if I was trying to protect myself.” \nOfficers said some of Beckman's lawyer references were jokes. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney John Davis interrupted Noble's questioning at one point to tell U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Cohen that he believed that the law was clear that \"I think I might need my lawyer” is not enough to be an invocation of someone's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. \nBeckman agreed to allow police to recover a gun from his 2016 Subaru, a small amount of marijuana from his house and $5,000 in ransom money from his office safe, according to court testimony, but only if he could accompany officers. \nAfter officers retrieved the money and keys to a TanCo minivan suspected to have been used to drop off the kidnap victim, Beckman asked to use the bathroom. \nJoseph Somogye, a DEA task force officer, said Beckman \"asked me if he could get something to drink.” Somogye initially didn't notice that Beckman had pulled a bottle of vodka out of the freezer and poured it into a glass. \n“When I realized what he was doing, I stopped it,” he said. Somogye said Beckman never appear impaired. \nNoble implied through questions that in a phone call with his wife, Beckman had shouted “Call Travis and get him down here.” But Beckman's wife didn't testify and two police witnesses denied it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:34:41.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
