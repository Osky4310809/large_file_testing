And Democrats? \nNorth Carolina Senator Richard Burr, a Republican who was about to be re-elected after a tough fight, was recorded telling his volunteers: \n“If Hillary becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court.” \nImagine what a fundamental difference a few days make. As soon as Trump had won the presidential election and Republicans defended their Senate majority, the Republican tune changed completely. \nTwo sets of rules for Republicans \nNow, they intoned full of conviction, the vacant Supreme Court seat, suddenly theirs to fill, it needed to be filled right away. \nTrump soon announced conservative hardline Appeals Court Judge Neil Gorsuch. The nominee, like the late Antonin Scalia, is credited with a strong legal mind — although he is widely regarded , hard though that is to imagine, as more conservative on both business and social issues than the man whose seat he would be filling. \nIt also didn’t come as a surprise that Republican Senators who had refused even to meet with Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland for nearly a year were now calling for his instantaneous confirmation without so much as a hearing. \nThe status quo — a workable new world \nSince Scalia’s death in February 2016, the Supreme Court has made do with just eight justices. And yet, there has been no legal standstill. \nTied decisions simply revert back to the decision of the specific, geographically-based Appeals Court the case came up from and do not apply across the full country. \nIn general, for those interested in maintaining recent protections of civil rights and human rights, as well as voting rights, abortion rights, labor rights, workplace protections and environmental safety, it has been better to have four-four decisions, rather than sweeping conservative decisions. \nHad Scalia lived until the end of 2016, many key decisions would have gone very badly on those issues. \nNot just a line in the sand \nThe operative question in U.S. politics now is how Democrats are going to handle the issue of Neil Gorsuch. Are they going to act like typical Democrats — and let the Republicans have their way? \nOr have they finally developed the political spine to act like the Republicans did — and surely would have, in case Hillary Clinton had been elected president. \nThey would have erected an impenetrable wall to continue their blockade of any new nominee selected by a Democratic President. \nA great deal is at stake \nWere Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed to replace him, at the still very tender age (for a Supreme Court Justice) of 49, which may give him as much as four decades of service on the Court, and with additional vacancies from the liberal side likely, things will look very dark indeed. \nAs things stand, the much heralded American cause of common sense, as well as any expectation for a fair, rational and equitable 21st century governance in the United States would disappear even more than it has already done with the very temperamental Trump in the White House. \nJust turn the tables \nThe Democrats’ task isn’t too difficult. Republican Senators already made the case last year that there is no urgency to filling a vacancy, even if it effectively reduces the size of the court by one member for five years. That number could drop further if any justices retire or die in the coming four years. \nClinging to mechanistic thinking and very un-Republican notions of “fairness,” many Americans, including many Democrats, seem concerned that it would be dangerous to leave the seat vacant any longer. \nBut while Republican Senators may have been cynically crafting a new argument for their political convenience, which they have now walked back, are principled blockade politics only a prerogative of Republicans? \nThe legal frame \nLet’s think this through more closely. As it stands, Republicans were not really incorrect. \nFirst, the U.S. Supreme Court, the highest constitutional court in the land, surprisingly does not have a set number of justices specified in the U.S. constitution. It is set by law and therefore subject to revision by Congress. \nThe number has been nine since 1869, but it varied over the years. Indeed, in 1866, just a few years earlier in the tense aftermath of the U.S. Civil War, Congressional Republicans had lowered the seats from ten to seven. \nThey did so specifically to prevent President Andrew Johnson , a Democrat, from filling vacancies as they opened. Remarkably, one seat was already vacant when Republicans made the reduction in the court. \nThis sort of court “un-packing” does, therefore, have some precedent. \nSecond, in the real world, the court functions adequately with eight members (now and previously) and it would function fine with seven, as it has done before. \nWhat’s at stake for U.S. society and the world \nThe Gorsuch discussion is not occurring in some political vacuum, as many Republicans now pretend. It is about far more than giving a well-qualified man the job for which he is well qualified, as they are likely to argue in artful innocence mode. \nViewed in the relevant context, the issue agenda the Supreme Court gets to rule on, the importance of confirmation now or delay for good cannot be underrated. \nThis isn’t just true for life in the United States itself, but also globally.After all, if the Supreme Court tilts in a very conservative direction, given the role of the United States in world affairs, this will have a very negative impact on people all around the world. \nThe list of issues thus at stake includes: The environment (climate, drinking water and air quality) Voting rights and district fairness Campaign finance and clean elections Racial justice, criminal justice and policing Labor rights & workplace protections", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:48:35.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
