A teenage girl's interest in the occult draws her into a dark vortex of evil and possession \nOuija boards... demons... possession... Satanism.... The words themselves strike fear in the hearts of many people - especially those with strong religious beliefs. Danielle is one of those people, yet in the span of a month, the curiosity of her youth drew her away from her church to what her faith would call the dark side. And the results, according to her sworn testimony below, would be devastating and terrifying. \nNon-believers would say that Danielle's experience was strictly psychological in nature, a product of her deep-seated religious belief system.
