We need to have a balance between youth and experience. They are important in that.\" \nBoth Cazorla and Mertesacker remain unavailable due to injury, although recent reports suggested the former Germany international is close to a return. \nHowever, Wenger has made it clear the 32-year-old defender still needs some more time, having been out fore the entirety of the season so far. \nMan Utd fans claim Griezmann is a done deal \n\"Mertesacker is not close to a return,\" Wenger added. \"He had a little calf problem. \n\"He is on the pitch but not close. He is still three or four weeks away, not more.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:44:59.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
