Philstar.com/File photo \nMANILA, Philippines -   is set to sign “anytime soon” the order on the pension increase for the two million retirees of the Social Security System (SSS), Malacañang said Tuesday. \nThe president has agreed to raise the SSS pension by P1,000 to provide social protection to retirees. \nSSS Chairman Amado Valdez had said the increase would take effect last February 15 but it was delayed because Malacañang has yet to sign the order that would implement it. \nSenior Deputy Executive Secretary Menardo Guevarra said the communication on the pension increase is ready for submission to the president. \n“We have prepared the appropriate communication to be sent by the Office of the President to the SSS and it’s about to be signed by the president anytime soon,” Guevarra said. \nSSS originally proposed a P2,000 pension hike but economic managers opposed it, saying it could bloat the liabilities of the pension fund and cut its actuarial life if not accompanied by higher contributions.   \nBudget Secretary Benjamin Diokno, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia, and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez had warned that a P2,000 pension increase would hike SSS liabilities to P5.9 trillion from P3.5 trillion. The proposed pension increase could also reduce SSS’s fund life by ten years, they added. \n“There are concerns about the viability of the fund but those concerns are being addressed,” Guevarra said. \n“But that concern is also being addressed by our economic managers. They have proposals on how to go about dealing with the increased burden on the SSS without having to necessarily increase contributions from the employees,” he added. \nGuevarra noted that the pension increase would be retroactive from January this year.
