But on Sunday she witnessed a true New York City moment when a bottle of bubbly rolled out from underneath the subways seats, bringing some strangers together to share a toast.\nSEE ALSO: A group of New Yorkers came together to remove swastikas from a subway car\nA full bottle of wine just rolled out from under a subway seat and now these 2 strangers popped it open & are drinking it. This is peak NYC pic.twitter.com/lni474aoY9\n— Colleen Hagerty (@colleenhagerty) February 26, 2017\nHagerty explained in an email that she was heading uptown on the 6 train between 12:30 a.m. and 1 a.m. on Sunday between Union Square and Grand Central when the magical moment occurred.\n\"It was your regular off-hours commute — not super crowded, everyone pretty much keeping to themselves,\" Hagery said. But then a man in a grey jacket noticed an unopened bottle of bubbly, he picked it up and opened it.\n\"Once the man in the gray jacket picked up the bottle and started opening the bag around it,\" Hagerty explained, \"people started smiling and paying attention. Once the bottle was popped, people were laughing, and at least one person besides me took out their phone to capture the moment.\"\nFortunately, the bottle was something bubbly that didn't require a wine key.\nHagerty says that after the man in the gray jacket popped the bottle of wine, the man next to him made a joke, and the two started searching for a container to share the drink.\n\"A guy sitting across from them pointed out an empty liquor bottle under the seat, which the man in the hat picked up and then man in the gray jacket poured some into during one of the stops,\" Hagerty said.\nIt's unclear if the man just picked up a random bottle off the floor or if he had discarded it earlier, but as a New Yorker I can say that sometimes you just really need a drink, so don't judge too hard.\n\"People on the train were all laughing along, and it was just a nice, funny moment,\" said Hagerty.\nThe two clinked glasses just as Hagerty snapped the photo. It was truly a beautiful NYC moment.\nAs for Hagerty, she says she's been loving the response from everyone after her tweet with the photo blew up.\n\"I can't say anything I see on the subway surprises me at this point, but I definitely was not expecting such a response from people online,\" Hagerty said.\nBONUS: Device will turn your fruit into cider that will get you drunk", "external_links": ["https://t.co/lni474aoY9", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/mVXsBub0.jpg", "https://twitter.com/colleenhagerty/status/835733326937882625", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/mVXsBub0.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-01T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:13:49.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
