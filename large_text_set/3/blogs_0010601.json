Everything that has ever led up to this very moment... I was born to create that record. I was born to sound exactly like I sound on that record. I was born to take all the flak. I was born to understand and grow from what happened on this record. \n\"This record was 100% the culmination of how hiding and making yourself that little fly on the wall, as opposed to standing firm and being who you're supposed to be, it can kill you inside. It can make you feel like youâ€™re not worth anything.
