It comes as Espírito Santo, like many states racked by Brazil’s worst recession on record, struggles to ensure even basic health, education and security services.

The union said they have not received a raise in four years. \nThe base monthly pay for an officer is 2,643 reais ($850), according to Corporal Thiago Bicalho, a spokesman for striking police. \n“We are going to analyze the offer and see what we can do in reality to advance this situation,” said Julio Pompeu, director of the state’s human rights secretariat, who is helping the government negotiate with police. \nThe two sides are scheduled to meet again later on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:04:38.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
