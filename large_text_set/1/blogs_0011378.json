Getty Images / Photolibrary Updated October 23, 2015 . The red-haired entity looked like Jordan's sister... but it wasn't \nWas it a doppelganger ... or a ghost ? What was the entity that appeared repeatedly to Jordan, her mother, and her sister that took on the physical characteristics of her sister - even her clothing - yet would not allow its face to be seen? And what would happen if her sister did see its face? These experiences have the confusing elements of doppelganger sightings with the unnerving spookiness of a haunting. This is Jordan's story... \nTHIS HAS BEEN an ongoing experience for my mother, sister, and me. We have all seen this \"thing,\" and the only way we can explain it is that it's my sister's doppelganger. Not many people look like my sister. She has very long red hair, so it's not hard to miss her and you can't mistake her for someone else. \ncontinue reading below our video Highest Paid Male Actors Ever \nFIRST SIGHTING \nThis all started in the Fall of 2004 when I was in sixth grade in Oviedo, Florida. I was in my room trying to fall asleep when my door opened and my sister came in -- or what I thought was my sister. I didn't have a nightstand at the time, so I just used a picnic cooler with a blanket over it. It had my alarm clock and some hair brushes on it. My \"sister\" came over and was messing with my brushes, which I remember really made me mad because it was late and I was trying to sleep. \nI began yelling at her to get out of my room. She didn't say a word, but just abruptly turned and left. As I watched her leave, it seemed to me that she was walking funny. She walked at a very fast pace with her head turned and hair over her face, hiding her eyes and mouth. \nThe next day, I confronted my sister about coming into my room in the middle of the night. She swore - in fact, still swears to this day - that she was not in my room and had no idea what I was talking about. \nMOM'S SIGHTING \nThat was my first experience with her doppelganger. My mom and even my sister have seen it, too. One day about a year after my experience, my mom was at home while my sister and I were at school. We were old enough to wake up and get ourselves ready and make it to the bus stop without any help from our parents. My sister would wake up earlier than anyone since her school started at 7:20 a.m. \nFrom my understanding, she did in fact make it to school on time. Yet my mom swears up and down that she saw my sister walking around the house with a towel on her head, like she just got out of the shower. My mom was so mad that my sister missed the bus to school, she started yelling at her. Again, just as in my experience, this \"person\" was walking in a fast-paced manner, my mother said, and she never saw her face. She was walking so fast, but my mom kept yelling at her, thinking she was going to have to drive my sister to school. When my mom followed her into the other room, however, there was no one there. \nWhen my sister came home after school and my mom told her what happened, my sister was puzzled because she really was at school. My mom thought she was losing her mind. I don't believe I told my mom about my experience until after she saw it, too. We both came to the conclusion that there had to be something wrong with its face, and that's why it never let us see it. \nI believe there is something dead wrong with its eyes, but that's just my theory. We never felt threatened by it because at the time we really thought it was my sister.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T09:49:53.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
