I've got a fever...and the only prescription is more CanJam! offline \nOne thing I didn't mention in the video (which definitely should have been mentioned) is that the Blue Mo-Fi's headband also has adjustable tension (adjustable clamping force), using the dial on top of the headband. \n\nI really like that Blue recognized that the multi-link headband mechanism they went with opened up the possibility to provide adjustable clamping force, and that they chose to go with it. Very cool stuff. \nSelect All Posts By This User Looks good but again over 300$ price makes you think again when you have many to chose from i know they are focused towards people who use mobile as their audio sorce not for people who use DAP\"s and Portable amps.

Also, I feel the arms connecting the cups are too exotic to be a 'safe' choice style-wise, I'm not a big fan. But the internal amp + bass boost, fantastic band, and boldness I'm sure will grab lots of attention!
