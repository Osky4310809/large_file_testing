Don't forget that Republicans DIDN'T EVEN GIVE OBAMA'S #SCOTUS NOMINEE A HEARING \n— Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) March 21, 2017 \nThose big mean Republicans! How dare they do what Democrats have done for decades! \n— The Arquette Sisters (@ArquetteSisters) March 21, 2017 \nYeah that’s right Sally, you have people like Chuck Schumer and especially Joe Biden to thank for Neil Gorsuch. \nHeck, we should send them both cookies. @sallykohn We didn't forget. It was named after his VP, aka \"The Biden Rule\". \nYou didn't need to shout. \n— Gregg Hart (@RGreggHart)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:31:40.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
