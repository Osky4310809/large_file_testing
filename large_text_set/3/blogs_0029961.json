The Rat Pack king made the announcement on social media today (March 29), sharing that the LP’s release date is May 5. The news comes with a promotional trailer revealing the cover art is a robot in an updated version of The Last Supper. In the clip, a tour guide takes a group of children past the image as part of a futuristic art gallery. \n“Back in the day there were different creeds, nationalities, colors, but it’s all different now,” the guide shares. \n— Rap Larry David (@Logic301) March 29, 2017 \nEverybody will be available as a standard and deluxe version with the latter featuring a documentary of the recording process of the album. Digital pre-orders for both formats will go live March 31. \nThis follows the release of Logic’s 2015 album, The Incredible True Story , which debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 and further catapulted the Maryland star after he dropped his Under Pressure LP in 2014. His debut project is now certified gold . \nIn between The Incredible True Story and Everybody , Logic dropped his Bobby Tarantino mixtape. He also shared he was working on a project called AfricAryaN , exploring his biracial identity.
