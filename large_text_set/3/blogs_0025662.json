James Harris Jackson, 28, spent more than two days wandering Manhattan trying to gather fellow bigots to kill black men at the Crossroads of the World — but he had little luck, the sources said.\nSo instead, on Monday he used 66-year-old Timothy Caughman, who is black, as target practice before his planned assault on Times Square, according to officials.\nProsecutors said the slaying was “an act mostly likely of terrorism,” because Jackson came from Maryland to rack up a body count.\n“His intent was to kill as many black men here in New York as he could,” Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon told Judge Herb Moses during Jackson’s arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court on Thursday.\nTimothy Caughman Twitter Jackson is being charged murder in the second degree as a hate crime and weapons possession.\nJackson took a bus from Baltimore to the city Friday night with the express intent to “target male blacks,” according to Chief of Manhattan South Detectives William Aubrey.\n“Mr. Jackson targeted the man on 9th Avenue because the man was black and Mr. Jackson regarded the killing as practice prior to going to Times Square to kill additional black men,” a criminal complaint states.\nHe pounced on Caughman near Ninth Avenue and W. 36th Street at about 11:15 p.m. Monday, stabbing Caughman repeatedly before fleeing. Caughman stumbled nine blocks to the Midtown South station house at 11:24 p.m. — he was taken to Bellevue Hospital but died of internal injuries, officials said. Jackson turned himself in about a day later after seeing security camera images of himself on the news. \nHe told cops he gave himself up to prevent further bloodshed after seeing a mixed-race couple, police sources said. But he appeared unrepentant in court on Thursday, wearing a white Tyvek jumpsuit and a sneer on his face.\nJackson’s attorney told the court he has “obvious psychological issues.” Moses ordered Jackson held without bail.\nSEE ALSO \nWhite supremacist accused of murder says he came to NYC to kill blacks 0:0 A fame-seeking white supremacist came to New York to kill... Jackson has seethed with racism for the last decade, police sources said.\nHe attended the Friends School of Baltimore as a teen, according to officials there, who called his alleged actions “senseless.”\n“Our school — and the Religious Society of Friends — has a long history of commitment to diversity, racial equality, social justice, and non-violence,” the statement reads. “The entire Friends School community extends our deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Timothy Caughman, the victim of this senseless and incomprehensible act.”\nJackson’s family released a statement sending condolences to Caughman’s family and saying it was “shocked, horrified and heartbroken by this tragedy.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:06:59.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
