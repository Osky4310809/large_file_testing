When you’re an adult, not having a birthday party is sort of a blessing (unless you’re into that sort of thing), but in kindergarten? That shows some self-control.\nChicago native Armani Crews — maybe she’s so cool because her name is so cool — saw her older brother give away some leftovers to someone in need, and she had a lightbulb moment. She asked her mom, Artesha Crews, if she could do that for her birthday. At first, her mom suggested making and handing out sandwiches, but Armani was not about serve boring old sammies at her party, and she sure wasn’t giving them to actually hungry people. She wanted it to be delicious and useful.\nIt had to be party food. So her family prepared meals of chicken, fish, spaghetti, pizza, and mashed potatoes. Solid spread, Armani. Her mom mentioned it on Facebook and a mini food drive was born — friends, family, and neighbors started donating. They also collected bottled water and fruit. And then they started assembling care packages with protein bars, toothbrushes, toothpaste, hand sanitizer, razors, socks, deodorant, and other toiletries that people donated.\n& Meet Chicago kindergartner Armani Crews who gave up her 6th birthday party to feed the homeless.\nPosted by Michaela Pereira on  Tuesday, March 14, 2017 On the day of her birthday, Armani wore a tiara (because she’s obviously an IRL princess) and her family and neighbors set up tables with balloons and purple tablecloths. They served the hot food like catering, ordered pizzas, and handed out the care packages, waters, and snacks for people to take away, too. Around 125 people lined up. According to Armani’s mom said it “was a beautiful thing to see and a blessing.”\n“One man told us that he hadn’t had a hot meal in a long time.” Armani’s dad told her long before they started prepping that the food costs and everything would mean she wasn’t getting any presents, but she really didn’t care. In fact, she enjoyed the day so much, she and her family are going to do it again in a few weeks. Her mom said “There are plenty of places in Chicago that need help. If we help each other, we’ll be okay.”\nIs it bad that we’re secretly hoping Chicago celebs like Oprah or the Obamas get word of Armani’s food drives? Because if there’s one way to change the world, it’s with fresh socks and warm pizza.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:10:32.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
