Image copyright Twitter/@PrisonPlanet \nMalmo has a large immigrant population. \nLast October, the so-called Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a fire at a Muslim community centre there, an incident cited by the White House in the list of incidents it claimed had been under-reported by the media. \nIn a follow-up post, subsequently deleted, Mr Watson wrote: \"All you lefty idiots accepting a 'trip to Sweden'. Can you read? I said you'd be staying here. Good luck\". \nThe post featured a number of images to illustrate his point, including a photograph of anti-Israel protesters from the 2009 Davis Cup tennis match between Sweden and Israel. \nHundreds of people offered their services, including comedian Al Murray and journalist Laurie Penny .

Mr Pool has pledged to \"investigate the claims of 'no-go zones' and a rise in crime that people believe are coming from migrants and refugees\". Image copyright Twitter/@Timcast \nIn a video posted on his YouTube channel , Mr Pool says: \"This is a highly politicised phenomenon, with one faction saying it's true and you're denying it for political reasons, and the other side saying it's false and you're pushing the story for political reasons. \n\"I don't side with anybody. I'm a sceptic.\" \nMalmo's deputy mayor Nils Karlsson has promised any visiting journalists a warm welcome.
