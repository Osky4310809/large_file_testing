Thanks to the Facebook app’s upcoming update, videos will start playing sound automatically as you scroll through your feed. Here’s how to disable it. Advertisement \nPreviously, you could only hear video sound if you tapped on the video in your Facebook News Feed. Now, as long as your device isn’t on silent mode, sound will fade in and out as you scroll through all of those food videos. It might be a welcome addition to some, but for the rest of us, it’s a new annoyance to deal with if you don’t already have video auto-play disabled . On Your iOS Device \nFor your iPhone and iPad devices, start by opening the Facebook app and logging in if you haven’t already. Then: Advertisement Tap the three-lined hamburger button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Tap Settings > Account Settings > Sounds Tap the toggle to off for “Videos in News Feed Start With Sound” \nIf you don’t see the option, the update hasn’t rolled out to you yet. Check back later. On Your Android Device \nFor your Android devices, start by opening the Facebook app and logging in if you haven’t already. Then: Sponsored Tap the three-lined hamburger button in the upper right corner of the screen. Scroll down and tap “App Settings” Tap the toggle to off for “Videos in News Feed Start With Sound” \nIf you don’t see the option, the update hasn’t rolled out to you yet. Check back later. Also, there are no ways to disable news feed sound on your desktop browser for now, so you’ll have to just disable videos from auto-playing entirely .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:06:23.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
