This week, her search leads her to the crispiest fried chicken in the Orlando Disney-verse, available in the Western-themed Fort Wilderness Resort. Complete with cabins and campsites, the resort is close to the Magic Kingdom and accessible to non-guests by the park’s ferry service. The chicken in question appears by the bucketful as part of the Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue , the Vaudevillian dinner theatre spectacular that’s been running continuously in Fort Wilderness’ Pioneer Hall since 1974. According to Wisel, the show’s Wild West-themed antics and possibly cringey audience participation moments are a small price to pay for the dish, which is served all-you-can-eat-style with cornbread, salad, and ribs. (Pro tip: If the show is not your speed, you can skip the revue and still feast on chicken by the bucket next door to the theatre, at P & J’s Southern Takeout. Sing-alongs averted.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:10:25.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
