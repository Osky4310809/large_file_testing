We share a list of images of Teddy Bears in various hues that you can gift to your loved ones and make them feel special. Happy Teddy Day 2017! \n1. Blue Teddy Bear – Love is deep \nBlue is often associated with the hue of sky and sea. This colour is one of the most royal shades and symbolises depth, intelligence, truth, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, stability and trust. If your lover gifts you a blue Teddy Bear, it is an indirect signal that he/she is madly in love with you and you are really lucky to have him/her by your side. \n2. Green Teddy Bear – I am waiting \nGreen is the colour of nature and symbolises growth, harmony, freshness, fertility. This shade indicates that your lover will always wait for you! This tone has a very strong emotional connect. \n3. Red Teddy Bear – Love is in the air \nRed is considered an auspicious shade, but also a colour of fire and blood and so associated with danger, energy, war, strength, power and determination. But red is also the colour of passion, desire and never-ending love. It describes the emotional intensity between two people. \n4. Black Teddy Bear – Love is Rejected \nBlack symbolises ultimate power and elegance, but also death and evil. It is also associated with strength and formality. If your lover gifts you a black Teddy Bear, then s/he may have rejected your proposal! In such a case, do not be sad or depressed, because a Teddy Bear in any colour is super cute and let it bring a smile to your face. \n5. White Teddy Bear – A lready booked \nWhite indicates peace, purity, innocence, and a good spirit. It represents a great beginning, as this colour has a positive connotation. But for Teddy Day, if you receive a full white Teddy Bear, then better understand that your lover is already in a relationship with someone else. Better luck next time, bro! \n6. Orange Teddy Bear – All set to propose \nOrange indicates energy, happiness, joy, sunshine, enthusiasm, fascination, creativity as well as passion. This colour instantly gives the sensation of heat and hence associated with fire. Receiving an orange Teddy Bear as a gift means the person will soon propose to you! This is an indirect signal; you had better be prepared and look super gorgeous on Valentine’s Day, if you have received an orange Teddy on Teddy Day! \n7. Pink Teddy Bear – Proposal accepted \nPink represents compassion, affection, nurturing and love. This shade of colour symbolises unconditional and never-ending love. Pink is made up of red and white and gives a signal that your lover has finally accepted your proposal. \n8. Purple Teddy Bear – Better luck next time \nThe Purple colour is made up of blue and red colours. Both these colours show stability and energy, whereas purple symbolises power, nobility and luxury. This colour evokes feelings of love and creates a romantic atmosphere. But strangely, a Purple Teddy Bear indicates that the person is no longer interested in you and it’s time to move on. \n9. Yellow Teddy Bear – Break-up \nThe yellow colour is the shade of sunshine and is associated with joy, happiness, intellect and energy. But at the same time, if you receive a yellow Teddy Bear, it may mean that your lover wants to break up with you! \n10. Brown Teddy Bear – Broken hearts \nBrown is considered a bit dangerous as a colour, but also indicates stability, structure and strong support. This colour means protection and responsibility. By any chance, if your love gifts you a brown colour Teddy Bear, they say it is a signal that you have broken his/her heart. Better try to solve the matter and present a red Teddy Bear. But strangely, a brown Teddy Bear is most popular as a gift! \nSo, which Teddy Bear are you planning to gift to your partner on Teddy Day 2017?
