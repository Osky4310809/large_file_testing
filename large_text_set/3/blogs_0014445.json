Published Share Tweet Follow Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on December 28th, 2016. (Getty) \nAs Donald Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States, fifteen new men and women will also soon be entering the presidential line of succession. \nOf course, everyone knows that the vice president takes over if the president is impeached, resigns, or dies in office, but what happens if that vice president must also vacate the office? This has never happened before, but as outlined in the Constitution, in this scenario the presidency would be passed to the speaker of the house, then to the president pro tempore of the Senate, and the line of succession goes all the way to the secretary of Homeland Security. \nOn special occasions when all of the members of the line of succession are gathered together in one place, such as the State of the Union address, one of them – a “designated survivor” – does not attend. This is so that if there were to be some sort of a terrorist attack on the Capitol, at least one member of the line of succession would survive and would be able to lead the country, even if they might be a secretary of Agriculture or Health and Human Services with little government experience. \nSo which individuals will make up the line of succession under the Donald Trump administration? Assuming Trump is able to get all of his cabinet nominees confirmed, here’s what it will look like. 1. Mike Pence (Vice President) Mike Pence at Trump Tower on November 18. (Getty) \nIf Donald Trump were to vacate his office, Mike Pence would take over and become the 46th president of the United States. \nPence is the former governor of Indiana, and he is much more of a traditional Republican than Donald Trump. He is also further to the right on some issues than the rest of his party, as is the case with same-sex marriage. While he was governor of Indiana, he passed a bill called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which ensured that businesses would be allowed to refuse service to gay people. \nIf Mike Pence were to take over for Donald Trump sometime over the course of the next few years, he would be the 15th vice president to assume the presidency because the president vacated the office. So far, that has happened with John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford. \nMike Pence is also the only member of the line of succession who was elected to his position by the American people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T15:45:27.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
