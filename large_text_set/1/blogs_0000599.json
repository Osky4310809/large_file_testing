Both Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad contained numerous easter eggs, including one that confirms a longtime DC staple. \nThe studio launched a viral website for the movie called Argus-gov . The site allows you to research files for the various Squad team members, including names like Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Killer Croc, and Slipknot. While the resident rope expert wasn't featured in the movie very long, they did manage to sneak in a Flash easter egg thanks to her personnel file ( via Reddit ). \nIn the other info section of the file, it notes that the character was moved from Alabama to Keystone City, Keystone being the city that The Flash calls home. Depending on the source, the city is sometimes called Central City, but it looks like the DC Cinematic Universe favors Keystone. You can view the image up close in the gallery. \nAssemble a team of the world’s most dangerous, incarcerated Super Villains, provide them with the most powerful arsenal at the government’s disposal, and send them off on a mission to defeat an enigmatic, insuperable entity. U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller has determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose will do. However, once they realize they weren’t picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it’s every man for himself? \nWritten and directed by David Ayer, the film starred Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, and Viola Davis. The cast also included Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Scott Eastwood, Cara Delevingne, Adam Beach, and Karen Fukuhara in her feature film debut. \nSuicide Squad: The Extended Cut is now available on Digital HD, Blu-ray, and DVD.
