That I promise you. You messed with the wrong one. You are weak for attacking a woman. No more statements at this time. Please respect the privacy of everyone involved and the family.” Kim Kardashian's final snap chat before she was robbed in Paris (Photo: Snapchat) Kim with Kanye and the kids in August 2016 (Photo: Rex) \nThere was also criticism of Kim flaunting her jewels on social media; she Snapchatted a video of the diamond ring worth £4 million that was stolen in the raid. \nKim fled Paris the day after the ordeal to reunite with her husband, Kanye West, and children in New York, but is said to have spoken extensively to police and given a statement. \nAn investigating judge in France could now travel to New York to speak with her further.

This is a formal process, which cannot be done on the phone, or even via a video link,” said barrister Jean Veil last year.
