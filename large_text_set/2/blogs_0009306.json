Good on the ball. \nArter 6 \nAlways niggly, full of energy and tenacious. Vital to Bournemouth’s midfield. \nSurman 6 \nNicest man in football, but fairly unproductive night on the pitch. \nFraser 5 \nBooked. Subdued performance as he created little going forward. \nWilshere 6 \nWent off injured before half time. Had done well in front of Guardiola.

Looked dangerous. \nKing 7 \nHad an effort ruled out for a shirt pull on Stones. It was the right call. \nSubstitutes \nMings, for Francis, 23 mins, 6 \nAfobe, for Wilshere, 45 mins, 6 Manchester City \nCaballero 6 \nMade a brilliant last ditch block to deny Ibe and is a better bet than Bravo. \nSagna 7 \nExcellent right back, always so steady and reliable. Solid defensively. anchester City's Willy Caballero saves from Bournemouth's Jordon Ibe (Photo: REUTERS) \nStones 7 \nWas fairly solid, had one scare but generally kept Bournemouth’s forwards quiet. \nKolarov 6 \nHis distribution better than his defending. His mobility does help give an edge. \nFernandinho 6 \nPlayed as a makeshift left back, did well with some of his long range passing. \nToure 6 \nBooked. Having got an early booking, lucky not to get a second of foul on Afobe. \nDe Bruyne 6 \nDeeper midfield role suits his passing range. In good form.

Big blow, he’s been terrific. \nSane 7 \nIs getting better with each game, has so much pace and threat down the wing. \nSubstitutes \nAguero, for Jesus, 15 mins, 6 Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:17:27.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
