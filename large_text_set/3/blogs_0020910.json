None of these March Madness Thursdays are exactly the same. Sure, year after year, all us fans spend them on a comfortable seat, perhaps something tall and cool in our general vicinity, but for every measure of order in our own actions there are several doses of chaos on the court. This 2017 tournament is no different. Did you miss some or all of the action? Looking for a little bit of context? Here are the biggest surprises from one of the most perennially surprising days in sports. Sean O'Mara Breaks out in Xavier Upset of Maryland 2 of 6 Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images The loss of Michael Cekovsky hurt Maryland in a big way. That was never more in evidence than it was Thursday, when No. 11 Xavier's lightly regarded bigs plowed through the No. 6 Terps for a solid upset 76-65 victory. At the tip of the metaphorical spear was Sean O'Meara, the 6'10\" junior who was previously Musketeer Number Seven with 5.5 points per game. He also averaged 2.8 rebounds. Against an undermanned, Cekovsky-less Maryland frontcourt, O'Meara went for 18 points and seven rebounds. Even star point guard Melo Trimble—perhaps playing his last game in a Maryland uniform—couldn't bail the team out when he finished with 13 points, three assists and two steals. Xavier now advances to face Florida State on Saturday. Middle Tennessee Beats Minnesota in 5-12 Upset 3 of 6 Reggie Upshaw Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images Last season, the Blue Raiders of Middle Tennessee State University were a No. 15 seed in this tournament. They took down second-seeded Michigan State that season. Perhaps their 81-72 upset of Minnesota Thursday wasn't quite as dramatic, but it was an upset nevertheless and it further establishes MTSU as a giant killer to be reckoned with. It also registered as the first 5-12 of this tournament. JaCorey Williams, Giddy Potts and Reggie Upshaw combined for 47 Blue Raider points, but it was a team effort for MTSU. Minnesota leading scorer Nate Mason had an off night, shooting only 2-10 from the field for five points—well below his 15.5 season average. Virginia Scored More Than 70 Points 4 of 6 Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports You are to be praised, Virginia Cavaliers. This is the stuff of kings! As you know, the No. 5 Cavaliers are second in adjusted defense nationally according to KenPom, but dead last in adjusted tempo , according to the same site. So it's hard to get the kinds of possessions it takes to score the big seven-zero. UVA managed only 67 per contest on the year. It must have been heartening for Cavs fans, then, when they went for 76 in staving off a game No. 12 UNC Wilmington team. Senior guard London Perrantes was the catalyst with 24 points for Virginia, and Marial Shayok came off the bench and out of relative nowhere to add 23. Caleb Freaking Swanigan 5 of 6 Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images The Big Ten Player of the Year put in some work Thursday against the Vermont Catamounts. Caleb Swanigan, who may have been underestimated nationally, went for 16 points on 5-11 shooting, 14 rebounds, four assists and three blocks. It's no small feat, as Vermont came in with the longest winning streak (21 games) in college basketball. The Catamounts were valiant behind Anthony Lamb and his 20 points, but the Boilermaker front court, led by Swanigan, was just too much. For the Purdue veterans, it was particularly sweet, after the sting of last season's Thursday upset loss to Little Rock. \"I've been sitting in front of you all ready to cry the last two years,\" said forward Vincent Edwards after the Vermont win, per Nathan Baird of the Lafayette Journal and Courier . \"It feels great to finally get past the first round. It's something that's been haunting us the last two years.\" They have Swanigan, the most eye-popping player of this young tournament, to thank. Last-Second Mistake Lifts Northwestern Bryant McIntosh Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports You have to feel bad for Matthew Fisher-Davis. After putting in a team-leading 22 points, Fisher-Davis intentionally fouled Northwestern guard Bryant McIntosh with 14.6 seconds left. At the time, Fisher-Davis' Vanderbilt team led the Wildcats 76-75. But then the foul, and two made free throws from McIntosh put Northwestern—playing in their first NCAA tournament—up for good. \"I actually thought we were down one,\" Fisher-Davis said afterward, according to the Associated Press ( h/t ESPN ). \"Coach [Bryce Drew] pointed at him, but he was just telling me that was my matchup. I took it as (I should) foul.\" Lots of credit to Fisher-Davis for facing the music after the game. If it's any consolation to Commodores fans, Northwestern now must face top-seeded Gonzaga.
