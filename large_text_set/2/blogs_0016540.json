It’s not that you’re materialistic, it’s just that money comes very high at the top of your “worry list”, and you often find yourself daydreaming about a future of wealth and fortune.\nGetty Images You got: To be famous You’d probably never admit it out loud, but you’ve always been intrigued by the idea of fame. Even though you know it wouldn’t be easy, the thought of going to all the best events and chilling with celebrities has always seemed appealing. And you’re sure you’d use your fame for good anyway.\nGetty Images You got: To fall in love You’re a die-hard romantic who’s in love with love. Even when you’re not in a relationship, you’re a sucker for a cute couple or a rom-com movie that pulls at the heart strings. You have a lot of love to give, and you’re always looking to share it.\nGetty Images You got: To travel You’re an explorer and believe that life’s too short to stay in the same place. There’s nothing that excites you more than seeing the world, and you’re always looking for the next big adventure.\nGetty Images You got: To stay young Even though you know that ageing is a natural part of life, the idea of getting old scares you. You often feel like you’re wasting your life away if you’re not doing something at every moment, and have a tendency to compare your own achievements with the achievements of your agemates.\nGetty Images You got: To be stress-free Your main priority is to live a relaxed, stress-free life, where everything is happy and chill. For this reason you absolutely hate confrontation (you rarely have arguments with your friends), and largely like to go with the flow rather than plan things.\nGetty Images   10561080   \nGena-mour Barrett  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:09:36.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
