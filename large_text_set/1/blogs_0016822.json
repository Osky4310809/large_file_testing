Photo by Sid Hastings \nJEFFERSON CITY • Bill numbers don’t typically hold any special significance – most of the time, they're numbered in the order lawmakers file them. \nBut HB 302, legislation that would establish an emergency alert system to help catch those who harm police officers, is a nod to Ballwin police officer Michael Flamion, 33, who was shot and paralyzed from the neck down during a traffic stop in July. \nFlamion’s badge number is 302. \nRep. Justin Hill, R-Lake Saint Louis, is a former police officer who said he filed the bill in Flamion’s honor. \nThe “Blue Alert” system is similar to Amber and Silver alerts, which help police find missing children and senior citizens, respectively. The alerts, which include information describing the suspect, can then go out statewide. \nIt’s a proposal that already has the blessing of Gov. Eric Greitens , who says Missouri should join 27 other states that have the system, vowing to work with the Legislature to get it in place. \nGreitens also mentioned the idea in his State of the State speech on Tuesday as he discussed public safety improvements and violence in Missouri cities, including St. Louis. \n“I want to establish a Blue Alert system, so that we can find and bring swift justice to anyone who assaults a law enforcement officer,” Greitens said. “And my administration will work with this body to pass the toughest laws in the country for anyone who assaults a peace officer.” \nSpeaking to a House crime prevention panel, Hill said the need for the system has heightened in the digital age. \n“This day and age, information travels so fast. Even information among evildoers. Whereabouts of law enforcement, how we can injure those law enforcement officers,” Hill said. \nRep. Shamed Dogan, a Ballwin Republican who is sponsoring a similar bill, also recalled Flamion’s shooting – which happened just miles from Dogan’s home – as his inspiration to work on the measure. \nHe said that while the federal government has created a blue alert system, lawmakers in Congress are “squabbling” over it and haven’t yet appropriated the funding. \nGreitens’ support helps prioritize it in Missouri, Dogan said. \n“This really is an issue that’s percolated to that level of attention throughout the state, and the eyes of the state are on us,” Dogan said. \nAfter the shooting, Flamion spent three months at a rehabilitation center in Colorado. Now back in Missouri, he recently received the Law Enforcement Purple Heart and Medal of Valor in December.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:41:32.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
