A new report claims that the carrier plans to raise its current activation and upgrade fee from by $5, from $20 to $25, starting on Friday, Jan. 20.\nSee also: Best AT&T Android phones 15 hours ago The report comes from the usually reliable Droid Life , citing unnamed sources. However, it has yet to be confirmed by AT&T so take this story with a small but noticeable grain of salt. AT&T did confirm earlier this month that it plans to charge their currently grandfathered unlimited plan customers an additional $5 per month starting in March.\nIf AT&T does increase its activation and upgrade fee, it will be following a similar move by Verizon Wireless, who quietly boosted its own phone upgrade fees from $20 to $30 earlier this month. This move affected new customers who were paying for their new phone on Verizonâ€™s device payment plans or if they paid in full for their new phones. Verizon also has ditched its two-year contract options for all of its customers.\nHow do you feel about AT&T possibly raising its upgrade and activation fees for new phones?
