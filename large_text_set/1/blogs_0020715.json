But the group had to bow out, because a group had threatened to sue them. Poster promoting chorus’s trip to Italy (WBZ-TV) \nA former school committee member, Leslie Lathrop, contacted Americans United For Separation of Church and State. \nThat group then wrote a letter to the school superintendent saying in part “Taking public school students to worship services as part of a public school activity is a flagrant violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution.” \nThe school district had decided not to fight the group in court. \nOn Tuesday, it was announced that the church had altered tradition to allow the group to perform between masses. \nAnsara said that, while the group is grateful for the change, she wishes the whole thing had never happened in the first place. \n“While both the Chamber kids and their parents are absolutely thrilled that they will get to perform at the Basilica, we wish the superintendent at the time did not acquiesce to the letter from the AU and we hope this never happens again for future performance requests. \nThe group is set to travel to Italy and Croatia in April, where they have several other performances scheduled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T19:58:46.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
