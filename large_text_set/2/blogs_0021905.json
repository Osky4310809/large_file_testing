But on neither platform will you get to see any deleted scenes or alternate versions of scenes, Disney reps confirmed to Mashable .\nThat's unusual for a Star Wars movie. The Force Awakens , for example, arrived on home video last year along with six deleted scenes . \nAnd it's especially unusual for Rogue One , given the highly publicized reshoots — and the last-minute re-editing that reshaped the entire third act of the film.\nSEE ALSO: 'Rogue One' reshoots changed more of the movie than we knew \nThat's not to say there isn't an impressive array of bonus content arriving along with the release. Here's what Disney and Lucasfilm are offering in exchange for your hard-earned dollars:\nA Rogue Idea – Hear how ILM’s John Knoll came up with the movie’s concept – and why it’s the right film to launch the Star Wars stand-alone films.\nJyn: The Rebel – Get to know Rogue One ’s defiant, resourceful survivor, and hear what it was like for Felicity Jones to bring her to life onscreen. \nCassian: The Spy – Diego Luna shares insights into his complex, driven character, who becomes a hero through selflessness, perseverance and passion.\nK-2SO: The Droid – Explore the development of this reprogrammed Imperial droid, from initial pitch and character design through Alan Tudyk’s performance.\nBaze & Chirrut: Guardians of the Whills – Go deeper into the relationship between these two very different characters, with Chinese superstars Jiang Wen and Donnie Yen.\nBodhi & Saw: The Pilot & The Revolutionary – Forest Whitaker and Riz Ahmed reflect on Saw Gerrera, the broken Rebel leader, and Bodhi Rook, the Imperial pilot who defects. \nThe Empire – Meet a dangerous new Imperial adversary…and cross paths once more with the most iconic villain of all time.\nVisions of Hope: The Look of Rogue One – The filmmakers describe the challenges and thrills of developing a bold new look for the movie that can fit within the world of the original trilogy.\nThe Princess & The Governor – See what it took to bring the vibrant young princess of Star Wars : A New Hope – as well as one of her most memorable foes­ – back to the screen.\nEpilogue: The Story Continues – Filmmakers and cast celebrate Rogue One ’s premiere and look forward into the future, to the Star Wars stories yet to be told.\nRogue Connections – Uncover Easter eggs and film facts hidden throughout the movie that connect Rogue One to the Star Wars universe.\nBut the lack of any deleted footage remains a surprise. \nFans have noted at least 46 shots seen in the trailers that didn't make it to the final film — and while many of those appear to have been shot for promotional purposes, most of them suggest the existence of entirely unseen scenes.\nIndeed, somewhere in this world there exists a \"director's cut\" of the film — Gareth Edwards' original version before the editors went to work on it. \n\"We moved some of the things that our heroes did,\" editor John Gilroy told Yahoo Movies UK about the tricky third act on the tropical planet Scarif. \"They were different in the original then they were as it was conceived.\"\n\nThat explains why Jyn Erso is seen facing off against a TIE fighter in the trailers, but not in the movie. And why we expected to see her racing across a beach, dodging giant AT-ACT walkers, while carrying the Death Star plans on her belt. \nBut if you want to see the rest of that footage, it seems you'll have to break into the Disney or Lucasfilm vaults. For now, both of them are locked up tighter than the Imperial archives on Scarif.\nBONUS: 'Rogue One' roundtable: A spoiler-filled debate", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:34:40.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
