And right now that majority is Republican. \nIt is therefore a measure many Republicans, including President Trump and many House Republicans, would love to see the Senate take, especially on Supreme Court nominees. \nHowever, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is said to be loathe to kill the filibuster, both because he is a traditionalist and because he – like many others – foresees the day when Republicans will be in the minority. \nAs Ed Morrissey of Hot Air once wrote: googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nThe only thing keeping the Senate minority relevant is the legislative filibuster, which is why House Republicans want it eliminated. However, McConnell’s been around long enough to know that it’s a suicidal strategy. Yes, Republicans would be able to slam their entire agenda through Congress to the White House, but that will be true of Democrats at some point when they regain power in Washington. That’s when, not if, and McConnell knows it. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nYet if McConnell allows his reluctance to kill the filibuster to lead him to accept this deal, it would likely be politically disastrous for him, and for any other Republican should he or she also go along with. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \nConservative host Mark Levin on his March 22nd program has already called the deal “nuts.” And conservative website Legal Insurrrection has asked “Gorsuch is likely to be confirmed with or without a deal, so there’s seemingly zero reason for Senate Republicans to even entertain such a deal if it was being discussed.” \nAny deal that allows Gorsuch to ascend to the SCOTUS would be a hard-sell to many on the Left as well, even if it would benefit them down the road. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:43:15.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
