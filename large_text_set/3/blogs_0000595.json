As you might recall, Prince William and Duchess Kate visited India and Bhutan last year on an official royal tour and from the looks of their photos , it was pretty much a dream vacation.\nThe reception on Monday was a major bash. Not only were all the high ranking royals in attendance, but there were also Indian dancers, a menu featuring decadent Indian cuisine and a guest list that included fashion designers, actors, writers, artists and athletes of Indian descent. Because if anyone knows how to throw a party, it’s the Queen of England.\nThe Duchess of Cambridge arrived in full-princess mode, wearing a glittering dress from the British fashion label Erdem . She looked like a glass of fizzy champagne, and we love it. We love it hard.\nYui Mok - WPA Pool/Getty Images This whole look is giving us Cinderella vibes like we’ve never had before.\n\nBut the shoes, you guys. THE SHOES. Look at them!\nYui Mok - WPA Pool/Getty Images I mean, they’re basically the modern-day version of a glass slipper.\nThe shoes are platinum lamé pumps from designer Oscar de la Renta, so you don’t even need a fairy godmother to get your hands (feet?) on a pair. (But you do need a really healthy PayPal account.)\nOscar de la Renta oscardelarenta.com Price: $690.00 \nWe know. $690 is steep, even for a pair of princess heels. Not to worry, though. We’ve found some less expensive alternatives! We’ve even included a pair of flats on our list, in case you want to channel Princess Kate minus the 4-inch heel.\n\nVince Camuto Olson Embellished Pump vincecamuto.com Price: $104-170.00 \nSteve Madden Glitter Pointed Pumps us.asos.com Price: $92.00\nINC International Concepts Zitah Rhinestone Evening Pumps macys.com Price: $89.50 \nCall It Spring Nusa Pump callitspring.com Price: $22.49 \nBadgley Mischka Daisy-II Pointed Evening Shoe badgleymischka.com Price: $198.00 \nBlue by Betsey Johnson Joy Evening Flats macys.com Price: $99.00 \n*shoe swoon*\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T09:18:04.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
