Given that Matt Oswalt and a few others pointed out how much Trump’s almost daily criticisms on Twitter sound like the ravings on a supervillain, Hamill thought it was only fitting that he give them a voice . \nEnter The Trumpster, a weekly dive into Trump’s latest attack on one of his critics that mashes the Joker with the president-elect’s words. The end result is something special given how well Hamill gets into his Joker role. The focus of Hamill’s recording this week is Trump’s response to Meryl Streep’s speech at the Golden Globes . He’s already a bit behind given today’s comments, but the final product is worth the wait: \n\nMatt Oswalt, the original inspiration for the recordings alongside Billy West and Maurice LaMarche, commented on the latest one with something we might actually see given all the discussion about Russia that is swirling around the president-elect. It might not happen, but the entire situation is uncharted territory for American politics. \n@HamillHimself @TheBillyWest @serafinowicz can't wait to hear you do Trumps impeachment hearing as Trumpster\n— Matt Oswalt (@MattOswaltVA) January 15, 2017 \n\nAnd in honor of Hamill’s efforts, the Trumpster gets his own creepy fan art. Who knows where The Trumpster will go next week. \nGalloo gallay! It's #Trumpster Day!
