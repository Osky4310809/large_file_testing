(KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS) SPECIAL TO THE NEWS  16 PM \nPresident Trump held a press conference on Thursday afternoon. In the doing he created a new reality show that Americans are just going to love over the next four years. \nThe name of the show? Beat the Press. Webster's Dictionary defines the word \"beat\" in several ways, but the two most relevant here are \"to strike forcefully\" and \"to overcome, as in a contest; defeat.\" The President did both at his press conference. \nThere he stood, Trump in the lion's den as it were. Calmly, methodically he called on reporters all over what the President and his staff see as the hostile media landscape. There was CNN's Jim Acosta, sharply reprimanded weeks ago at a presser by the then president-elect, now recognized and engaged in a back and forth. (Full disclosure, I am a CNN contributor. As a former Reagan aide these Trump/Acosta matches seem increasingly to remind of President Reagan's famous duels with ABC's Sam Donaldson. They are definitely \"get the popcorn\" moments.) There was a scolding for Jake Turx, Ami Magazine's White House Correspondent, who seemed to be suggesting that Trump was anti-Semitic. Turx later said Trump's impression was not true, that he was merely trying to get the President's thoughts on a rash of anti-Semitic bomb threats and other actions. Be that as it may, Trump would have none of it. \nAnd so it went. \nCongress must probe Trump's denials on Russia \nAs it wound down, speaking directly to the CNN coverage he sees as biased but really addressing the larger issue of media bias he said: \"…the public sees it. They see it. They see it's not fair.\" The President is correct about the public's view of the media writ large. As was noted by a Gallup poll released last September in the middle of the presidential campaign confidence in media fairness had \"dropped to its lowest level in Gallup polling history…\". \nMake no mistake. President Trump is one of the savviest media watchers ever to occupy the Oval Office. Raised both personally and professionally in New York City, the media capital of not just America but the world, he has played the media for decades as if he were a world class violinist working his equally world class Stradivarius. \nThe real question here is not \"how did he do?\" The answer to that is simple. His critics hated his performance and his supporters will love it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:44:17.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
