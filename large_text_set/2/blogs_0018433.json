The hearing was over whether Presley -- who was dressed in a loose-fitting black pantsuit and white blouse that she paired with dark lipstick -- should have to pay Lockwood's attorney fees and other costs related to the court case. While the two do have a post-nuptial agreement from 2007, the judge ultimately ruled that Presley pay her ex $50,000 in increments of $10,000 monthly for reasonable fees and court costs, which includes some attorney fees, until a trial date is set in order to determine the validity of the post-nup.

Respondent has no assets and petitioner has hidden assets that has given her this income,\" Lockwood's lawyer, Jeff Sturman, said. Sturman further alleged that Presley makes about five and a half million dollars a year, and questioned the amount of debt she was claiming to have.

Elvis Presley's only daughter said she was \"shocked and horrified and sick to my stomach\" upon making the alleged discovery. Presley asked the court to deny Lockwood's request for $40,000 per month in spousal support and $100,000 in attorney fees.
