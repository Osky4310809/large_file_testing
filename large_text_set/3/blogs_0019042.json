The actress and singer, who was the singing voice of Mulan in the animated classic, reacts to the news that there will be no songs featured in the upcoming live-action remake. Photo by Vernise Tantuco/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines – Lea Salonga – who was the singing voice of Mulan in Disney's animated classic – says it's totally fine for the movie's live-action remake not to feature any songs. \nAmidst of the hype on Disney's live-action Beauty and the Beast , Mulan director Niki Caro confirmed to Moviefone that the remake won't have any of the songs: \"From what I understand, no songs right now, much to the horror of my children,\" she said. \nOn Twitter, Lea reacted to the news with approval, saying, \"I think it's pretty cool! Let the film be a different thing altogether!\" So what do I think about the live-action Mulan not having the songs? I think it's pretty cool! Let the film be a different thing altogether! — Lea Salonga (@MsLeaSalonga) March 20, 2017 \n\"Or... take a cue or two from Yentl, where the music was organically intertwined with everything. That might be another idea to explore,\" she added in another tweet. Or... take a cue or two from Yentl, where the music was organically intertwined with everything.

It was based on a play of the same name, written by Leah Napolin and Isaac Bashevis Singer. \nLea also said that having no music in Mulan may be a good decision, based on the live-action Cinderella (2015), which didn't feature music. Hang on. This may just be a great decision. If the live action Cinderella is any indication, we're in for a really cool ride. https://t.co/UQRal5dIEp — Lea Salonga (@MsLeaSalonga) March 20, 2017 \n\"I ask for two things from the live-action Mulan : one, an Asian actress that'd be believable as a boy or a man, and a hunky Shang,\" said Lea.

Kelangang iba. And please, sexy Asian men!!! Please!!! There's tons!!! — Lea Salonga (@MsLeaSalonga) March 20, 2017 @analette And Ming-Na as the matchmaker. She's such a badass. — Lea Salonga (@MsLeaSalonga) March 20, 2017 @analette I'd wait and see. If there are going to be songs, they have to come from an organic place. And hire kickass triple threats. — Lea Salonga (@MsLeaSalonga) March 20, 2017 \nMulan is set to be released in the US on November 2, 2018. – Rappler.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T12:44:36.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
