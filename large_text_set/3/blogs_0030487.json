Candace Marie Claiborne, 60, of Washington, was charged with felony obstruction and lying to the F.B.I. after her ties to the Chinese were uncovered, the authorities said. Prosecutors did not disclose where or when the Chinese first approached Ms. Claiborne, but did reveal she had once served in Beijing and Shanghai . According to a criminal complaint, Ms. Claiborne, who had a top secret security clearance and was required to report foreign contacts, repeatedly interacted with Chinese intelligence agents for five years. “She purposefully misled federal investigators about her significant and repeated interactions with foreign contacts,” said Andrew W. Vale, the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.’s Washington field office. Chinese agents wired cash to her bank account, according to the complaint. They also showered her with a long list of gifts and benefits that included an iPhone, a laptop computer, meals, international travel and vacations and tuition at a Chinese fashion school, the F.B.I. said. In addition, she also received a fully furnished apartment and a stipend. \nAdvertisement Some of the gifts were provided directly to Ms. Claiborne and others through an unnamed co-conspirator, the F. B. I. said. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.
