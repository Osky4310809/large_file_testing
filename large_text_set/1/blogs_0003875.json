Many times she will notice something he didn’t know about at the time – like a woman putting her bags on an empty seat instead of letting Amit sit down.\nWatch the footage here: \n&&&&& To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nPeople barging past Amit in the station Kika is one of only 5% of guide dogs that are trained to take their owners on escalators, but she can still get very upset when other users hit her or barge past her.\n‘It all started when people barged me out of the way [on the escalator],’ he said. ‘They have loads of space to get past, but they seem to think it is fun to barge into a blind person.\n‘Kika always sits to my left hand side so we often block the escalator, and people will hit her with bags and umbrellas to get her to move out of the way.\n‘The worst part is the tutting and negative comments behind me. People are so rude and arrogant and assume they can do whatever they want.’\nAmit Patel with Kika at Canary Wharf station (Picture: SWNS) Amit even described being ordered to apologise for ‘holding people up’ on the escalator.\n‘One lady even said I should apologise to the people behind her for holding them up. I asked her if I should apologise for being blind and she said “yes”.’\nHe added that Kika gets scared when people hit her on the escalators – and so does he.\n‘It really scares Kika sometimes. I can feel how upset she gets, and when I get upset she senses it as well – and she won’t go on the escalators for a few days.’\nPassengers not giving up their seats for Amit and Kika Amit travels almost every day on Southeastern trains to London Bridge, and then on the London Underground.\nWhile travelling, people will often ignore him and not give up their seats. One woman even kept her shopping bags on the empty seat next to her, and wouldn’t budge.\nFamily threatened with asbo because of noise two-year-old son makes ‘People just don’t care,’ Amit said. ‘They assume I’m going to take up the whole carriage.\n‘Sometimes I get a train with my four-month-old son and I say quite loudly, “Kika, find me a seat”, but no one budges.\n‘When my wife reviewed a piece of footage once, a lady was sitting on a seat and had her shopping on the one next to her.\n‘Sometimes the only way I get a seat is to scratch Kika behind the ears so she shakes a little. No one likes a wet dog.’\nAmit attached a GoPro camera to Kika’s back (Picture: SWNS) She films the abuse he can’t see (Picture: SWNS) Kika is sometimes hit with an umbrella by frustrated passengers (Picture: SWNS) Ignored by station staff and cab drivers Amit has a specific route he usually takes, but he says that when he is in unfamiliar surroundings – because roads or tube lines on his normal route are closed – he has been ignored by station staff.\nIn one video clip filmed by Kika, he waits for five minutes for staff to help him – despite them looking directly him. Eventually he has to call out for assistance.\nPeople in over-50s complex banned from playing music, drinking and singing Those staff members claimed they didn’t see Amit and Kika, but footage later reviewed by Amit’s wife showed otherwise.\nAmit has also filmed taxis refusing to stop for him, and passers-by distracting Kika by touching her.\n‘There are taxi drivers who will see you and won’t stop, sometimes train staff will say they didn’t see me when they clearly did,’ he said.\n‘People even walk right up to me but then swerve at the last minute. They also come up to Kika and touch her and distract her while she is walking, which puts her off.’\nAmit says he was once told to apologise for ‘holding people up’ (Picture: SWNS) Kika and Amit can both sense when the other is sad (Picture: SWNS) ‘A scared little boy’ Amit said Kika once saved his life when a car ran a red light at a crossing in Lewisham.\n‘She saw the car and she got in front of me and took the hit,’ he said. ‘The car grazed her nose. It was three days before she could work again.’\nBritish cabin crew member found dead on railway track near Amsterdam Amit now volunteers with RNIB, Action for Blind People, and Guide Dogs for the Blind to help coach new guide dog users.\nBut even then, being ignored, pushed around and abused makes the simple process of getting around terrifying for him.\n‘Losing my sight was very lonely,’ Amit said. ‘If I’m travelling by public transport, I’m sometimes like a scared little boy sat in the corner.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T14:37:54.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
