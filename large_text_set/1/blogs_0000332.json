Here are a look at eight ways the record books were re-written on Monday night in Pasadena. 1 Deontay Burnett: Most touchdown receptions (3) \nBurnett tied Braylon Edwards' 2005 record of three touchdown catches in a Rose Bowl with three. That included the Trojans' final touchdown, which tied the game at 49-49 with just 1:20 to play. Kirby Lee USA TODAY Sports 2 Matt Boermeester: Most field goals made (three) \nBoermeester tied a Rose Bowl record with three field goals made (including the game-winner as time expired), a mark held by five other players. He is however, very likely the first kicker in Rose Bowl history to do a dab after a game-winning field goal. 3 Penn State: Most points ever for a losing team (49) \nA mark that the Nittany Lions certainly wish they didn't own, as Penn State set an all-time record for most points in a Rose Bowl by a losing team with 49. 4 USC: Biggest fourth quarter comeback \nThe Trojans set a Rose Bowl record, by overcoming a 14-point fourth quarter deficit to get the win. Sean M. Haffey Getty Images 5 Trace McSorley and Sam Darnold: Most touchdowns responsible for (5) \nThe two quarterbacks were each phenomenal, with both tallying five touchdowns a piece. That is the tied for the most touchdown scores ever for one player in a Rose Bowl game with two other players. Gary A. Vasquez USA TODAY Sports 6 Sam Darnold: Most touchdown passes in a game \nDarnold's five touchdown passes, were most all-time. 7 Sam Darnold: Most points ever in a Rose Bowl game (32) \nDarnold accounted for 32 total points - five touchdowns and a two-point conversion - as he broke Vince Young's record for most all-time points scored in a Rose Bowl. Gary A. Vasquez USA TODAY Sports 8 Sam Darnold: Most yards ever in a Rose Bowl (474 yards) \nAnd most incredibly, Darnold broke Vince Young's single game Rose Bowl record of 467 yards, which was set during that iconic 2006 national championship game. \nSafe to say it was an incredible Rose Bowl, and we very likely won't see anything like it any time again soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:00:12.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
