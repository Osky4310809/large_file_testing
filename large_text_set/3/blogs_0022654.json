Lenny Fresquez, Holm’s manager, confirmed to the Albuquerque Journal on Tuesday that the Las Vegas-based promotion has proposed a bout against Ji Yeon Kim at UFC Fight Night 111 in Singapore on June 17. Fresquez told the Journal that the matchup is still being discussed and has not yet been accepted. Holm last appeared at UFC 208 in Brooklyn, where she lost a unanimous decision to Germaine de Randamie in a bout for the inaugural women’s featherweight championship. The Jackson-Wink MMA standout appealed the defeat on the grounds that de Randamie landed late blows at the end of rounds two and three that potentially altered the course of the fight and should have resulted in a point deduction. The appeal was denied by the New York State Athletic Commission. Holm has lost three straight bouts since her landmark second-round knockout of Ronda Rousey to claim 135-pound gold at UFC 193 in November 2015. A native of South Korea, the 27-year-old Kim compiled a 6-0-2 record while competing for organizations such as Deep, Road FC and Top FC. She has finished three of her victories by submission and one via technical knockout. UFC Fight Night 111 takes place at Singapore Indoor Stadium in Kallang, Singapore. No bouts have been officially announced for the card.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T09:45:38.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
