While news about the movie is being kept tightly under wraps, we know that bae Lin Manuel-Miranda is attached to the project, and that Lindsay Lohan is pretty keen to play Ariel .\nWell, now legendary Disney composer Alan Menken has opened up about his dream casting for Ursula in the live-action remake, and we could totally see this being absolutely EPIC. Speaking to Gay Times about Beauty and the Beast , Menken revealed that he’d love to see actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein take on the role in drag.\n“I’ve wanted Harvey Fierstein to play Ursula. I would kill for that!” he said. “We wanted that, and we would love it in a flash!” Fierstein has, of course, played many gender swapped roles, such as Edna in Hairspray on Broadway and on NBC’s recent Hairspray Live! He has also written the book for the iconic La Cage aux Folles and the recent Broadway success, Kinky Boots .\nA post shared by Harvey Fierstein (@theharveyfierstein) on Dec 26, 2016 at 5:33pm PST \nAfter hearing about the news, Fierstein took to social media to say that he’d LOVE to take the part if it were offered.\n“Oh, Alan, no need to kill anyone. Your wish is my command. As for the rest of you… Oh, you poor unfortunate souls!!!!” he wrote.\n& Oh, Alan, no need to kill anyone. Your wish is my command. As for the rest of you... Oh, you poor unfortunate souls!!!!\nPosted by Harvey Fierstein on  Monday, March 20, 2017 Tbh, we’d absolutely LOVE to see Fierstein take on the role of Ursula. We think he’d be able to bring that well needed camp element to the role, and he’s got the vocal chops for it, too.\nOf course, the details about the remake of The Little Mermaid are being held tightly to Disney’s chest, but we can still dream about our dream cast…\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:21:28.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
