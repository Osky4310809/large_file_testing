She was sat on the steps of the throne as a member of the Privy Council. Here she is: \nParliamentlive.tv \nLords have submitted more than a dozen proposed amendments to bill, including eight from Labour's frontbench. \nThe Conservatives do not enjoy a majority in the Lords meaning a there is greater scope for proposed amendments being successful, unlike in the Commons where all attempts to add amendments failed. T wo amendments — a call for the rights of EU citizens living in the UK to be guaranteed and a call for a commitment to allow Parliament a final 'meaningful vote' on Theresa May's Brexit deal — have the greatest chance of being passed. \nNumerous MPs have warned the Lords not to delay Britain's exit from the European Union. Brexit minister David Davis last week urged peers to carry out their \"patriotic duty\" and let the bill pass through Parliament without delay. May's presence in the chamber on Monday will only add more pressure on the Lords to follow the Commons' lead. \nParliamentlive.tv", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T19:42:40.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
