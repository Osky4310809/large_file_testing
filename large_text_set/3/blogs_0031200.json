The feature uses profile pictures of the people you're talking to on Messenger as shortcuts for the chat—they pop up on your screen, regardless of what you're doing, and invite you to tap into the conversation.\nWhile the feature can be useful sometimes, it's mostly just in the way when you're doing something else on your phone.\nMessenger also has a feature that lets you directly reply from your notification bar when you need to, so the Chat Heads are frankly a bit superfluous—and again, annoying. But they're still on by default.\nThankfully, it's pretty easy to get rid of them. Here's how:\nIn Messenger, click on your profile button on the top right.\nScroll down to the \"Chat Heads\" setting and toggle it off.\nVoila! Easy, right?
