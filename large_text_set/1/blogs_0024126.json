Trump meeting: The speech was made as she prepares to meet US President Donald Trump on Friday (REUTERS/Mark Makela) \nPointed references to the close Reagan-Thatcher relationship fuelled suspicions Mrs May is hoping for a similar partnership with Mr Trump. \nAsked by reporters whether she would struggle, as a reserved vicar's daughter, to strike a rapport with the brash property tycoon and reality TV star, Mrs May said: \"Haven't you heard? Sometimes opposites attract.\" Trade talks: The pair are expected to discuss a trade deal between Britain and the US on Friday (PA) \nBut the PM also sounded notes of caution over foreign policy positions taken by Mr Trump on the campaign trail, warning that his watchword with Vladimir Putin's Russia should be \"engage but beware\". Theresa May arrives in US for trade talks with Donald Trump \nShe described the Iran nuclear deal - which Mr Trump has threatened to tear up - as \"vitally important for regional security\". \nAnd she spoke out in support of the importance of international institutions like the UN, IMF and Nato, often the target of Mr Trump's scorn, in maintaining global peace and prosperity. \nSpeaking a day ahead of the White House meeting that will make her the first foreign leader to meet Mr Trump since last week's inauguration, Mrs May made no attempt to dissuade her audience from drawing parallels with the US and UK leaders of the Cold War era.
