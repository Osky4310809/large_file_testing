Mr Trump’s action could prove largely symbolic. Around 30 states already require power companies and utilities to increase their use of renewable energy over the next decade. And states with economic heft, such as California, are already climate champions. The Golden State has passed legislation decreeing that by 2030 its greenhouse gas emissions need to fall by 40% as measured against 1990 levels. Even in Republican strongholds, such as Iowa and Texas, Congressional subsidies have helped wind projects to thrive. On the stump Mr Trump promised to bring jobs back in the coal industry (he has since cut economic programmes in Appalachia). But reversing the moratorium on coal leasing is unlikely to further that goal. Although the move potentially proffers a huge subsidy, the low price of gas means King Coal will not regain his crown. And as for jobs, efficiency, rather than regulation, lies behind the losses. America produces 50% more coal than it did in 1940, but employs just one-eighth of the miners according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Of the other measures, taking aim at rules to limit methane emissions from oil and gas sites is particularly concerning climate-wise. The predominant constituent of natural gas, methane releases about half as much carbon dioxide when burned as coal and far less sulphur, soot and other pollutants. This has helped drive down American emissions in recent years thanks to the shale boom. Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for more than 500 years; methane just for 12. But the latter is many times more potent during that time. And perhaps as much as 2.5% of the stuff flowing through American supply chains escapes. Companies have an interest in stemming such leaks. This is fortunate given that if budget proposals pass Congress, the EPA will have far less cash with which to detect major spews of the stuff, such as that which occurred last year in Los Angeles. The squashing of the EPA pleases conservatives who believe the agency has overreached itself in recent years. They will also delight in the wide-ranging effects of the new executive action. But Mr Trump stopped short of authorising two truly crushing policies: instructing the EPA to reconsider its “endangerment finding” of 2009—which made the body legally responsible for regulating carbon dioxide emissions—and withdrawing from the Paris agreement on climate change, which aims   2C   temperatures. That, however, will provide little comfort to the scientists, officials and diplomats whose efforts now have been undone with a stroke of Mr Trump’s pen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:56:59.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
