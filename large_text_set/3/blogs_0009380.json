It's unprecedented and bizarre. \nThese aren't two small rugby clubs struggling to make needs meet. They are two powerhouses of the French game. \nIt's the equivalent of perhaps, in England, Saracens and Harlequins merging or, in a football example, Tottenham and Arsenal merging. \nThe details are still a bit sketchy at the moment. One of the reasons could be that Paris is such a diverse place and it doesn't, perhaps, have a rugby identity like other parts of France. \nMaybe they feel that in order to completely maximise their potential then there needs to be one superclub in Paris rather than two slightly smaller superclubs.
