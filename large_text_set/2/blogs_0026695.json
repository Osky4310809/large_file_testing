Kross Center, sources said.\nCorrection Officer Jacob Moore was ganged up on by three to five inmates, punched in the head and torso and even hit with his own chair, sources said.\nMoore, who had just started working for the city’s Department of Corrections in June, was sent to Mount Sinai Queens hospital for his injuries, which were described as serious by fellow officers. He could not be reached for comment.\n“I am outraged by this unprovoked, serious assault on our officer,” jails boss Joe Ponte told The Post in a statement Wednesday. “Attacks against the hardworking men and women who serve in our department will not be tolerated.”\nThe incident is being investigated internally by the DOC, and arrests are expected in the case, said a source with knowledge of the matter.\nThe brutal beating comes as city prison guards complain that reforms to reduce violence at Rikers have placed too much power in the hands of prisoners, who are running amuck.\nMayor de Blasio’s office says the reforms, including video cameras and officer retraining, has cut violence against staff by 11 percent.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:22:18.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
