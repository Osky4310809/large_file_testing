Charter seeks to create a cable giant through its proposed $67.1 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) \nSince spending $71 billion in May to buy Time Warner Cable and another company, Charter Communications has begun rebranding itself as \"Spectrum.\" \nBut even a catchy new moniker could not keep the nation's second-largest cable/internet provider company off the spectrum of the disliked. \nIn its thumbnail synopsis, the 24/7 reporters noted : \n\"Charter has one of the poorest reputations for customer service of any company in the subscription television service industry. It also scores below average in customer service compared to its competitors in the fixed line telephone industry and internet service industry.\" \nThat's not good news, considering that subscription television service, fixed-line telephones and internet service are pretty much the three things the company does for a living. \nIf there is good news for Charter within this list, it may be that the No. 1 most-hated company was Comcast, also a provider of subscription television and internet services. \nFounded in 1993, Charter moved its headquarters in 2012 from St. Louis to Stamford, Conn., but it maintains a corporate office and call center in Town and Country. \nJoe Holleman • 314-340-8254", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:54:36.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
