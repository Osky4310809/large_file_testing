And the note was to get rid of all that. The note was written out —‘He’s good at drumming. We get it.'” \nRhett Reese and Paul Wernick (“Deadpool”) “We wrote a parody of The Sopranos called The Tomatoes. It was all fruits and vegetables in the leads. it was the Tomatoes vs. The Bananas. The note came back, ‘We love it, but do they have to be fruits and vegetables?” \nKenneth Lonergan (“Manchester by the Sea”) “I’m trying to think of a really bad note that I’ve gotten, but for the past 20 years when executives give me notes I go into a kind of self-induced hypnotic trance in which I just nod and say…‘Oh that’s interesting.’ I pitched a comedy once and someone said, ‘Where’s the fun?’ I said I didn’t know. \nAllison Schroeder (“Hidden Figures”) “I was really excited, I was pitching this thriller with two female leads, about espionage. [The executive] said, ‘Oh! We love it! It’s great. Can you either change it to incest or two men? I said, “If you’ll really hire me? Yes.'” Also Read: Sony Leak: 28 Lies Hollywood Agents Tell Studio Executives About Their Actor Clients \nTheodore Melfi (“Hidden Figures”) “Most of the notes you get are from actors. They’re bad. This one studio [Fox Searchlight] person said, ‘Do we have to have so much math?’ So I pretended to be interested but, no, it’s about math. And then Kevin Costner calls me one night and says, ‘I’ve been thinking about a receding hairline.’ \n“I said, ‘OK. Why?’ He said, ‘I just think this guy would have a receding hairline.’ And so I call the studio because I love to torture them, and said, ‘ Kevin Costner wants a receding hairline,’ and they flip out, saying ‘We want Kevin Coster just the way he is!’ So I went back to Kevin and said everyone at the the studio thinks it will make you look old. He went, ‘Oh. Can I chew gum?'” \nBarry Jenkins (“Moonlight”) “So, where are the white people?” [ Note: Heisserer jumped in and said, “In the audience.” He got a big laugh .] \nEric Heisserer (“Arrival”) “It was the start of a pitch, I said ‘There’s a spy and his wife.’ The executive said, ‘There is no wife. Continue.'” Also Read: 'Lion' Roars Over Competition for Top Cinematography Prize \nTaylor Sheridan (“Hell or High Water”) “I’m with [Lonergan], when I start getting notes. It just starts to sound like the teacher from the Peanuts cartoon. I was in a meeting, I wrote this pilot for AMC, and we’re all sitting there and they’re giving me all their notes and I’m listening and at one point I say, ‘What the f— are you people talking about?” \nAnd they said, ‘Taylor, you have to look for the note within the note.” I said, ‘OK, but why don’t you just give me the note?’ They looked at me dead seriously and said, ‘Well we don’t know what the note is.'” \nTodd Black (producer of “Fences”) “We made a Western called ‘The Magnificent Seven’ [with Sony Pictures]. And the biggest note in development and shooting it was, ‘Do they have to wear cowboy hats and have facial hair?’ And I said, ‘Do you not want them not to have horses either?’ That was a huge note on a daily basis.” Oscars 2017: We Predict Nominations in All 24 Categories (Photos) \nTheWrap awards guru Steve Pond expects a whole lot of \"La La Land\" -- and some surprises \nBest Picture \nPredicted nominees, in order of probability: \"La La Land\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:16:05.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
