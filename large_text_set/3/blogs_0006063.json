Read More Over-55s are SIX TIMES more likely to use Kodi boxes to watch pirated video than young adults \nSelling these boxes is a breach of the Copyright, Designs and Patent Act 1988. \n\"Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) boxes (also known as set-top boxes, Android TV boxes or Kodi boxes) are small plug and play media servers, originally designed to allow consumers to stream legitimate content (locally stored or legal online content),\" said the IPO. \n\"Despite the legitimate use of this equipment, software is widely available (illicit Kodi extensions being the best known) which connect the boxes to illegal content through streaming websites, file lockers and BitTorrent trackers.\" Read More New Amazon Fire TV Stick brings Alexa voice control to your telly \nThe government agency added: \"Broadcasters and content owners have voiced concerns that, although a range of existing legislation applies to the sale and use of these devices (as well as the provision of illicit content streams), the legal framework does not provide sufficient tools to tackle this growing threat.\" \nThe Intellectual Property Office's consultations will end on April 7. \nThe Premier League itself has also taken steps to shut down the illegal streaming of matches. \nIt has secured a High Court order that allows it to shut down illegal video streams of football matches on Kodi by blocking access to the computer servers on which they are hosted.

Mr Mayes falsely claimed that they were \"100% legal\". \n\"I hope this conviction sends a clear message that criminal activity doesn't pay,\" said Lord Toby Harris, chair of National Trading Standards. \n\"I would also warn any person or business selling or operating such a device that they are in breach of copyright law.\" poll loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T17:56:17.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
