Now, about Julian Assange's extradition ...\nAppearing Tuesday night on Australian TV news show The Project , Assange was grilled by reporter Waleed Aly about his promise to accept extradition to the United States if Manning was released, a promise Assange has recently backtracked on.\nWaleed asks Julian Assange if he will leave the Ecuadorian Embassy, discusses his sources and why he has organised a tour. #TheProjectTV pic.twitter.com/rV6JR95ew0\n— #TheProjectTV (@theprojecttv) January 24, 2017\nIn a tense exchange, Aly pushed Assange on the point that it now appears Assange will only leave the Ecuadorian Embassy if he strikes a deal regarding his own case with the United States. \"I'm not a complete idiot!\" an exasperated Assange responded, before noting he instead expects there to be a discussion regarding the conditions of the extradition.\nAssange also told Aly that he believes Obama commuted Manning strictly to get revenge on him for WikiLeaks' role in leaking documents that affected the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nIn the interview, Assange claimed:\n\"So let’s look at it from their perspective. If we give Chelsea Manning clemency, what’s the result? That seems like it’s a favor to WikiLeaks. But we don’t want to do WikiLeaks a favor because they really kicked us in the teeth during the election. Okay, but it’s going to make life hard for Assange, because either he’s going to get extradited to the United States or we’re going to show he’s a liar and both of those things are going to make life hard for Assange, and therefore it’s okay to pardon Chelsea Manning, and that’s what happened.”\nThe questioning came after a topsy-turvy week in which Assange made the promise, seemed to double-down on the promise, and then backed away.\nShortly before Obama issued his final pardons and sentence commutations during his final week in office, WikiLeaks sent the following tweet.\nIf Obama grants Manning clemency Assange will agree to US extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case https://t.co/MZU30SlfGK\n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 12, 2017\nA few days later, on Jan. 17, 2017, Obama did just that, commuting the rest of Manning's sentence and setting her release from prison for May 2017. The night of Obama's announcement, WikiLeaks stayed the course, posting a few more tweets saying that Assange was moving forward on keeping his promise.\nAssange lawyer @themtchair on Assange-Manning extradition 'deal': \"Everything that he has said he's standing by.\"\n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 18, 2017\nAssange is confident of winning any fair trial in the US.

Pollack told The Hill , \"Mr. Assange had called for Chelsea Manning to receive clemency and be released immediately.\"\nStill, a tweet sent the same day as Pollack's comments made the same case that Assange made during his television appearance on Tuesday night.\nAssange is still happy to come to the US provided all his rights are guarenteed despite White House now saying Manning was not quid-quo-pro.\n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 18, 2017\nAssange's new claim about Obama is yet another twist in the ongoing saga, but he could soon have other concerns besides his ongoing battle with the U.S. On Tuesday, Sweden said it's closing in on deciding whether or not to indict Assange on rape charges related to an incident in August 2010.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/theMTchair", "https://t.co/MZU30SlfGK", "https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/819630102787059713", "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/24/decision-looms-on-assange-extradition-to-sweden.html", "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/314783-assange-lawyer-conditions-not-met-for-assange-manning-extradition-offer", "https://twitter.com/theprojecttv/status/823799536942358530", "https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/821753136692002816", "https://t.co/rV6JR95ew0", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheProjectTV?src=hash", "https://t.co/Mb6gXlz7QS", "https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/821528189625372672", "https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/821505178549493760"], "published": "2017-01-25T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:40:23.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
