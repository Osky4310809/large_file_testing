Elaine, 37, had been so poorly her family said she was ''like a walking corpse'' Credit: Cavendish Press \nA paramedic called to her home in Bury, Greater Manchester told her family: \"a migraine doesn't stop you from walking\". Mrs Talbot died later that day. \nCoroner Lisa Hashmi said Mrs Talbot's death was not preventable but criticised doctors, nurses and ambulance staff, saying there had been \"gross failings\" in their treatment of Mrs Talbot. \nMs Hasmi said she would be writing to the North West Ambulance Service about the behaviour of the \"bad apple\" paramedic and also to Bury Clinical Commissioning Group over the lack of availability of patient CT body scans for GPs. \nRecording a conclusion of death by natural causes, Ms Hashmi said: I can see the total sadness that this loss has brought to this family. Although I do not believe it would have altered the very tragic outcome, the senior doctor should have cast an eye over Elaine. \n\"I am very disappointed to hear about the behaviour of the ambulance staff. It does appear to be one isolated event with one bad apple - but by gosh is that bad apple going to hear about it. I think there has been a gross failure to provide basic care as so far as no CT scan being available. \n\"I do also believe that the doctors and nurses were blinkered in their approach. Do not be bound by what you know. You and you alone as a doctor create a diagnosis on your clinical opinions. \n\"Doctors and nurses ought to have taken a bit longer and heard what was happening to Elaine. It may be critical for the next patient. Think outside the box.\" \nD r Sanjita Patel a junior doctor who took charge of Mrs Talbot's care at her first hospital admission admitted she had not made any notes of her examination. Dr Patel added:\"I cannot prove that I examined her on my notes as I didn't make any notes. \n\"I think that the headache and migraine diagnosis were a bit of a red herring. In hindsight I can admit that I was probably blinkered by the previous diagnosis yeah. \n\"I should have asked her. I think it is a very difficult case in hindsight.\" \nIt also emerged that a nurse questioned about the tragedy by a senior NHS official admitted she had failed to fill in documentation about Mrs Talbot's care correctly because she was \"too busy.\" \nBut Ms Hashmi also handed a warning down to nurses who claim to be 'too busy' to fill in documentation properly. \"You are playing with fire. Nurses may find themselves in deep water if they say this. It is not an excuse and will not wash in a court of law.\" \nT he tragedy occurred in September 2017, just a month after Mrs Talbot's symptoms began to show. She went to see her GP on August 30 after two phone consultations but was given repeat medication for migraines. \nOn August 31, Mrs Talbot attended Fairfield Hospital emergency department where she was placed in the care of a junior doctor and was only observed twice in a four hour period by nurses instead of every hour. She was then given an injection and discharged with further medication. \nHer GP, Victor Ogbo, said when he treated Mrs Talbot she showed none of the \"classic red flags\" of anything more serious than a migraine. \nHer husband David Talbot, 42, said: \"She would have good and bad days. Some days she would go and lie down in a dark room, with all the lights off. She couldn't even look at the TV or her phone screen. She was trying to sleep it off. She was unable to reply or look at her phone when people text her.\" \nHer mother Dorothy, 69, told the inquest that on the 31st of August her daughter \"looked like a walking corpse\", adding: \"She looked terrible. She was out of it. She was wobbly. \n\"On the 7th of September when they arrived a member of the ambulance service said to us 'A migraine doesn't stop you from walking.' I just don't understand why they weren't willing to help us with her more.\" \nDr Piyali Pal a neuro-pathologist from Salford Royal Hospital said Mrs Talbot had a 'grade four' tumour, the most serious kind which can grow rapidly, in less than a month. She added: \"The life expectancy for someone with that severe a tumour is 12-15 weeks.\" \nD r Moataz Adnan a consultant at Fairfield General Hospital said computer systems had been updated their systems to ensure correct information was filed by staff. \nIn a statement after the hearing Mrs Talbot's family said: \"Elaine would do anything for anybody, she was caring and loving. Her children and her family were her whole life and she will be greatly missed. We miss her every single day and we are heartbroken. \n\"We as a family hope that the outcome of this is that the trust does implement their new pathways in the near future, so no other family has to go through what we have been through with Elaine.\" \nThe former engineer leaves four children aged between nine months and 12 years.
