Watch Gervonta Davis' stunning seventh round stoppage of Jose Pedraza \nDavis displayed his hand speed in the opening round, catching Pedraza with two jolting uppercuts, and also sunk a body shot below his opponent’s high guard. \nStung into action, Pedraza tried to force Davis onto the back foot in the second, but was stopped in his tracks by another crunching combination. \nThe southpaw was growing in confidence with every round and landed another crisp uppercut in the third. Davis is promoted by Floyd Mayweather, who watched from ringside \nA bout of showboating from Davis drew a determined response from Pedraza, who ended the fourth round strongly, and briefly pinned the Baltimore man on the ropes with a flurry of punches in the fifth. \nBut Davis would land a spiteful body shot in the sixth, which forced Pedraza to dip at the knees, and continued his steady assault in the following round. Pedraza failed to recover after being floored in the seventh \nWith Pedraza backing away, Davis whipped his right hand through the Puerto Rican's defences, dropping him heavily through the ropes and the fight was waved off when he rose unsteadily to his feet. \nEarlier on the bill, Ievgen Khytrov’s unbeaten record was shattered by a sixth round stoppage defeat against Immanuwel Aleem. Ievgen Khytrov sagged on the ropes in the sixth round \nIn an exciting meeting of two middleweight contenders, Khytrov was badly hurt in the very first round by an early barrage of punches from Aleem. \nHe was then floored in the third round and fired back to wobble Aleem, but would suffer another heavy knockdown in the sixth before the referee stepped in to rescue the dazed Ukrainian.
