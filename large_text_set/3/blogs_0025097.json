Us Weekly “Separate Bedrooms” — the headline screams: MELANIA’S SECRETS. The story claims the first couple are leading largely separate lives.\nOne insider said he did not think the anti-Trump cover this week caused their demise. “We were all gone anyway,” said the staffer.\nAmong the senior staff facing the ax with Steele: Editorial Director Jaimee Zanzinger; Creative Director Victor Thompson; Deputy Editor April Bernard; Photography Director Jennifer Halper; Entertainment Director Ian Drew; West Coast Bureau Chief Rebecca Bienstock; Deputy Editor Mara Reinstein; and Senior Writer Eric Andersson.\nAs Media Ink predicted, Publisher Vicci Lasdon Rose and all of her ad staff are being invited to join AMI. So is the most of the digital staff.\nIn all, about 80 people are being asked to AMI.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:53:31.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
