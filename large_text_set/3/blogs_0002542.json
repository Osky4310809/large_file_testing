While they may not approach every person at a party, they’re more than happy to engage when approached and can have in-depth conversations on the topics they know well. Sometimes ambiverts are more comfortable with a friend or two around. Small talk can be boring since it usually seems insincere, but they can do it if they have to. (source) \nAmbiverts are usually contextually driven. When they’re out, they can have a good time. But if their energy suddenly drops, they’re more interested in getting home and into bed. Additionally, certain situations can make ambiverts feel more introverted. Some do great at small parties or in classrooms, but feel more withdrawn at concerts, clubs, or other large scale social events. (source) \nAmbiverts can often be better at striking a balance in prioritizing people and responsibilities. This can lend more stability to their interpersonal lives and social circles. Ambiverts are also described as knowing \"when to speak up and when to shut up, when to inspect and when to respond, when to push and when to hold back.\" (source) \nObviously it can’t all be sunshine and rainbows. Because ambiverts can embody both extrovert and introvert personalities, they also can also take on the drawbacks of each. Maybe you need more stimulation to escape boredom or maybe while you can strike up conversations, you have a hard time at instigating friendships beyond that. \nIntroversion, ambiversion, and extroversion all exist on a spectrum, with most of the population falling somewhere in the middle. So at least you’re in good company, right? \nAre you an ambivert?
