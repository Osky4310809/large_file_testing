It is not the first such case that Rigel has seen, though he declares that it is \"very rare.\"\nNot according to Leighann Lassiter, the animal cruelty policy director at the Humane Society, reports The Guardian.\n\"It is a very, very seedy world when it comes to animal sexual abuse and it is extremely common,\" she said. “There are people out there who train animals for sex. You can give them your dog and they will train your dog to have sex with a human and send it back to you. And they get paid for it.\" She adds: \"We’ve got cases of people grabbing birds and having sex with birds. And killing the birds. It is really really disturbing.\"\nIt is currently legal to have sex with animals in Vermont, Texas, West Virginia, Kentucky, Nevada, Hawaii, Wyoming, New Mexico and Ohio, and Washington DC, notes The Guardian.\nLassiter said states without bestiality laws is often the result of historical laws which included animal sex abuse as part of the prohibition of gay sex. And when those laws against gay sex were repealed, so was the prohibition against bestiality.\nBut even in states where bestiality remains illegal, animal cruelty laws are often not enough to prevent people from sexually abusing animals, she explains, because a person might be prosecuted only if the animal is injured as a result of the sexual assault.\nAs for Amy Graves, she faces the possibility of up to 10 years in prison and would be required to register as a sex offender, if convicted.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:47:19.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
