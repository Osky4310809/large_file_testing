Now Available: Xamarin.Forms Pre-Release 2.3.4.192-pre2 \nA big thanks to everyone who invested time reviewing the Xamarin.Forms 2.3.4.184-pre1 release and filed reports for us. Several of you reported seeing our initial startup performance improvements on Android, which is great news as we continue to work on that. \n2.3.4.192-pre2 addresses a handful of regressions identified during testing. For complete details, check out the release notes here . Nuspec Change for Android \nWe’ve been working hard to find the best way to enable developers to use the newest Android Support libraries or any other library that has an API dependency greater than 23, while also allowing the smoothest first run developer experience with Xamarin.Forms and avoiding a poor dependency state. \nOnce you add the 2.3.4.190-pre2 NuGet of Xamarin.Forms to your Android project, make sure your Target Framework is 7.0 or newer. You can then install any Android NuGet that has a dependency greater than API 23. \nPlease take a good look at this change, as well as the pre-release as a whole. Let us know if you encounter any issues by sending us a detailed report .
