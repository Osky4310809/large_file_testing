From questionable privacy policies and mass data collection of its users to its handling of the so-called \"Fake News\" epidemic (see \" George Soros Is Funding Facebook's \"Third-Party Fact Checking\" Organization Targeting 'Fake News' \"), Mark Zuckerberg is pissing off a lot of people these days. Unfortunately, when your entire business model is based on \"friending\" others, the alienation of various groups has caused enough people to \"dislike\" Facebook that the company has landed itself on 24/7 Wall Street's list of \"America's Most Hated Companies.\" \nComing in at #6, Facebook narrowly beat out Spirit Airlines, which, for anyone who has been left stranded by Spirit in Chicago's O'Hare Airport in the middle of winter, that speaks volumes.
