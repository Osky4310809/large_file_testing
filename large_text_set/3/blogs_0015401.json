Ayo @realDonaldTrump shut your punk ass up talking shit about my uncle @SnoopDogg before we pimp your wife and make her work for us. \n‚Äî Shad Moss(Bow Wow) (@smoss) March 15, 2017 \nBow Wow, who goes by his government name Shad Moss now, returned a threat Donald Trump gave Uncle Snoop for depicting him as a clown in the visual for BADBADNOTGOOD‚Äôs remix of ‚ÄúLavender,‚Äù and creating a mock assassination. \n‚ÄúCan you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!‚Äù Donald tweeted out Wednesday morning (March 15). \nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio also expressed distaste over Snoop‚Äôs visual and believes that the image could present the wrong idea. \n‚ÄúSnoop shouldn‚Äôt have done that,‚Äù Rubio said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that is something people should really careful about. [If the] wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you could have a real problem. So, I‚Äôm not sure what Snoop was thinking. He should think about that a little more.‚Äù \nAnother fellow rapper who came to Big Snoop Dogg‚Äôs defense is T.I., who has been as equally vocal about the disappointment in Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency. He basically held a roast session in the caption of a screenshot of Trump‚Äôs tweet posted to his Instagram. A post shared by TIP (@troubleman31) on Mar 15, 2017 at 9:41am PDT \nDirector of the ‚ÄúLavender‚Äù visual, Jesse Wellens, has come forth and assured the President that it‚Äôs just a joke . I think I made some people a lil upset. It's just artü§° As much as people support Uncle Snoop, Twitter does not co-sign Shad Moss.
