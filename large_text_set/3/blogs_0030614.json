That conversation, sponsored by Mythicist Milwaukee , is now online. \nEhrman argued that there’s enough evidence to support a historical Jesus while Price said Jesus was nothing more than a mythological figure. \nMatt Dillahunty served as the moderator, and he gave his own talk on the subject the following day. \nI haven’t had a chance to watch the entire debate, but if any moments stand out, please leave a timestamp/summary in the comments below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:34:24.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
