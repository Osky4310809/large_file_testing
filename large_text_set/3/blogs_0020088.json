Trump… which is precisely why he will be delivering the commencement speech at antigay Liberty University later this year. \nIn a statement given exclusively to the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump said: \nI look forward to speaking to this amazing group of students on such a momentous occasion. Our children truly are the future and I look forward to celebrating the success of this graduating class as well as sharing lessons as they embark on their next chapter full of hope, faith, optimism, and a passion for life. … And homophobia . \nOK, OK. We added that last part. \nLiberty University likes to boast that it’s “the largest private Christian university in the world.” It was founded in 1971 by Jerry Falwell, one of the most strident homophobes in America right up until his death in 2007. \nThe university has come under fire in recent years for its stances on all things LGBTQ. In 2006, for instance, it banned all LGBTQ student groups on the grounds of “morality.” And in 2014, it filed for an exemption from federal anti-discrimination laws so it could openly discriminate against LGBTQ people. \nThe school also has a no gay sex policy. Upon enrolling, students are forced to sign a statement promising not to engage in homosexual sexual relations, or sex with a transgender person. The official policy states: “Sexual relations outside of a Biblically ordained marriage between a natural-born man and natural-born woman are not permissible at Liberty University.” \nLiberty University’s president and Trump’s BFF Jerry Falwell Jr. said they’re totally psyched that Donald will be speaking at this year’s graduation ceremony. \n“His supporters, including over 80% of the evangelical community, are thrilled with President Trump’s actions so far,” he tells the Christian Broadcasting Network. “The fact that the mainstream media and the Establishment (on the left and the right) remain in attack mode with their often baseless and dishonest claims against Trump is a sign that President Trump is doing a wonderful job.” \nIn other news, in the most recent Gallup poll, Trump’s approval ratings reached another historic low . He’s currently less popular than any U.S. President in over 70 years of polling. \nRelated: Thanks to millennials, Trump’s approval ratings are worse than any president in over 70 years ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:05:07.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
