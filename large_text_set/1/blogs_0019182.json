Of the 16 boxers he beat, only two stand out – Randall Bailey and Ali Funeka. \nNevertheless, Horn is confident he can defeat Pacquiao in front of his home crowd – Horn’s representatives are working hard to stage the fight in Australia – and even knock the Filipino out.   \nPacquiao, for his part, said it’s all talk for now. \n“He needs to prove it in the ring. Because in my previous fights many of them are saying they will stop me, they will knock me out and it’s not happening,” added the fighting senator, who last dominated Jessie Vargas to regain the title. \nWhile Horn is the frontrunner to land a career-defining showdown with Pacquiao, the latter confirmed that nothing is in stone. \n“We’re not finalizing yet, the fight or a future fight. I didn’t talk to Bob Arum about that yet,” Pacquiao said. \nBut the prospect of fighting in Australia excites Pacquiao, who said he’s been to Down Under “once or twice but for gambling.” \nPacquiao indeed knows a thing or two about the country. \nUnfortunately, he doesn’t know anything about Jeff Horn.
