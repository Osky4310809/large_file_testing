It’s a march for free speech,” said rally organizer Rich Black.\nIt is one of many scheduled nationwide.\nBut Black says the rally is also in response to the violent protest that shut down a scheduled speech by now former Breitbart editor Yiannopolous.\n“This cannot go unchallenged anymore,” said Black. “What you saw on Feb 1st, innocent people including bystanders being physically assaulted by these thugs. Lets call it what it is.”\nAlready, a number of different organizations are planning counter protests, including the group called By Any Means Necessary. Their website that’s often used by anarchists also has messages telling people to come out and disrupt the pro-Trump rally.\n“Very likely will end up being a violent sort of thing, which is really upsetting to think most likely it’s going to come to,” said Cal student Monisha Lensink-Vasan.\nA spokesman for the Berkeley College Republicans said they’re staying far away from the rally due to the potential danger.\n“The Berkeley College Republicans is playing no part in the event,” said Cal student Naweed Tahmas, who is a member of the Berkeley College Republicans. “We’re not organizing, not promoting it nor will we attend it.”\nEarlier this week on campus, someone destroyed their sign showing support for President Trump.\n“We don’t want the violence to escalate or our members to get injured,” Tahmas.\nThe March 4 Trump rally is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. at MLK Jr. Civic Center Park and will end on the Berkeley campus an hour later.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T04:00:05.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
