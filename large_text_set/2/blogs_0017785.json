Il y restera enfermé pendant 7 jours et 7 nuits. pic.twitter.com/jmUtC5u6GN — Palais de Tokyo (@PalaisdeTokyo) February 22, 2017 \nD uring an interview with AFP, the artist said that he has spent a considerable amount of time preparing himself mentally and physically for the practicalities of life within a boulder. He will be sustained on dried meat, cartons of soup and other liquids. \nWhen asked about how he will go to the toilet, the artist was reportedly evasive. \nHe is not concerned about loneliness as many people spoke to him during a similar rock-based performance in Marseille. So many people came to \"talk to the stone\" that security guards had to be called in to ensure the artist could sleep at night.

It takes several weeks to get back to normal,” he said. \nUpon completion of the week long entombment, Poincheval plans to sit on a dozen eggs for approximately four weeks until they hatch, in a performance called \"Egg.\" — Siobhán Silke (@siobh_ie) February 22, 2017 \nH e will have a half an hour break every 24 hours and his diet will be rich in ginger so that he can keep the eggs at a minimum of 37 degrees Celsius; ginger expands blood vessels which increases body heat. \nThe chicks that hatch \"will go and live with my parents\" said the artist. \nPoincheval is known for his unusual performances. Previously he has spent two weeks inside a stuffed bear, spent a week on top of a 20 metre pole, navigated a river in a corked bottle and has crossed France on foot in a straight line. — Paris HELPLINE (@parishelpline) February 20, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:03:42.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
