Photograph: Laura Wozniak \nEight times a day, seven days a week, this train passes – quite literally – through the Maeklong market. Vendors have to quickly remove their stalls from the tracks then resume as if nothing has happened. It’s rather spectacular. The easiest way to get there is to book a half-day tour, which includes the infamous Damnoen Saduak floating market. Laura Wozniak Snakes on a farm A malayan mangrove snake at the Bangkok snake farm. Photograph: Alamy \nThis doesn’t sound like a holiday activity but visit the Bangkok Snake Farm at the Red Cross institute and discover the important work that goes on here. Witness a live venom extraction by experts from a King Cobra – it will leave you breathless. ID3843121 Fill your lungs City skyline and Lumphini park, the ‘Green Lung’ of Bangkok. Photograph: Alamy \nTo escape the frenetic city, cross the river and head to the Green Lung (Bang Krachao). A gorgeous, lush jungle so named for its colour, shape and for its un-Bangkok-like fresh air. Rent a bike on arrival and explore its narrow jungle paths. Charlie Hayes Go to the top floor of Terminal 21 Photograph: Alamy \nThai street food is becoming a bit less accessible along Sukhumvit road. The top floor of Terminal 21, at the Asoke BTS/Sukhumvit MRT station interchange, has some of the best priced and quality “street food” anywhere in the city. It’s cheap and relatively clean but it’s very crowded when locals are buying their lunch. Brian Connell Sunset aerobics People do group arobics in Lumphini park. Photograph: Stephen J Boitano/Getty Images \nWhen the sun’s going down, the fun’s coming out at Lumphini park, where locals work out to the kitsch Thai tunes that will bring on a sweat hotter than a jungle curry. ID2437665 Tuck in at the night market Rod Fai night market. Photograph: Alamy \nAfter a disappointing night at the pricey bars around Ekkamai, we were thrilled to find the new Rod Fai night market in Ratchada. It’s hugely popular with young locals, giving it a vibrant and local energy that we’d been craving. There’s an undeniably hipster edge to it – VW vans converted into food stalls and bars adorned with fairy lights – but the variety on offer means there’s something for everyone. Jack Grange The humble public bus Photograph: Alamy \nSkip taxi touts and tuk-tuks. Take the rickety public buses of Bangkok for a real adventure. Bus information, especially in English, is scarce online, the bus drivers understand close to no English (but are very helpful), while hotels and tourist centres usually have no idea which bus heads where. So why bother? Bus-hopping allowed us to experience how the Thais do public transport, and the warmth and spontaneous helpfulness of local passengers was a hugely pleasant surprise. Fares are also incredibly cheap, and some are even free. Ernest Tan Great Thai omelettes \nChinatown is spectacular but obvious, so instead try out the alleys off Sukhumvit road near Asok BTS Skytrain station for the most fabulous Thai omelettes fried in dark oil and scattered with vinegar, chili and mustard seeds. We washed ours down with sodas from the fridge buzzing noisily next to us as scooters threaded their way through customers seated on low plastic stools.
