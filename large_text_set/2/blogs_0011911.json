The government can borrow money for the long term more cheaply than at any time in centuries. At the same time, councils and housing associations are screaming out for long-term funds to build the homes Britain desperately needs. Instead we are in gridlock, with the communities secretary Sajid Javid issuing a white paper that acknowledges the housing market is “broken”, and which admits we need to build as many as 275,000 homes a year compared with the 190,000 last year – but then only think of fixes that do not involve borrowing a penny. \nLocal authorities have excellent credit ratings and could use these to issue 30-year bonds on rates possibly as low as 1.5% to 2% interest. When private individuals borrow to do the same, with buy-to-let mortgages, they are praised for “investing for their future” and “securing their pension”. But if local authorities – who can borrow more cheaply than private individuals – try to do the same they are branded as irresponsible socialists. \nTheir hands are tied, not just by the Treasury but by a feeling that the 1950s and 1960s council estate building programme was a disaster. As someone who long cycled to work through two of London’s giant council estates – the Aylesbury and the Heygate – it’s difficult not to conclude that their architectural brutalism failed. The Heygate has since been demolished but its replacement – much of it luxury private flats – is not the answer, either. \nLocal campaigners claim that just 82 of the 2,704 new homes will be for social rent. Yes, some private money is now coming into “build to let” but it won’t be sufficient for the huge number of low-cost, low-rent homes that are required. \nIt is remarkable how, since the late 1950s, private sector output of homes has been consistently within a range of 150,000 to 200,000 per year. Above that level, demand can only be met by councils and housing associations, with an acknowledgement that the design failures of the 1950s and 1960s must not be forgotten. And there is absolutely no point in councils building, and then being forced to sell off their properties cheaply under right-to-buy, only to then have to subsidise the high rents charged by the buy-to-let landlords who have swarmed into that market. \nJavid wants Britain’s towns and cities to build upwards rather than outwards, demanding that the green belt be sacrosanct. This also means that city dwellers must live in ever more tiny spaces, with the government (as Guardian Money reports this week) suggesting we abandon minimum space standards agreed little more than a year ago. \nIn parts of Croydon, south London, where developers have been given a free-for-all to convert old office towers into residential units however they like, some are just 15 sq m. The idea that you can fit a bedroom, kitchen, eating area and bathroom into 12ft by 14ft is frightening. I was told many years ago by a private developer in London to only buy a three-bed home with a garden, because that’s the one thing families want, and the one thing they were no longer building. Demand would soar because supply was non-existent. I took his advice, and he was right. \nToday’s young adults are effectively being told that they must live in ever-smaller homes without gardens. Those in their 20s are already earning less than those in previous generations. They must put off starting a family until later in life. They cannot expect to buy their own home and must rent, instead. They must work until 70 to pick up a pension. And that pension will be less generous than their parents enjoyed. \nA renaissance in council house building is now essential – from new towns to new towers, and yes, even on parts of the green belt. Because unless we fix the broken housing market we can’t fix the ongoing breakdown in the social contract between the generations.
