(JIJI PRESS/AFP/Getty Images) \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday defended President Donald Trump's frequent trips to his golf courses and his club in Florida as \"part of being president,\" and not inconsistent with Trump's previous criticism of his predecessor. \nIn eight weeks since being sworn in as president, Trump has made 10 trips to golf courses he owns, according to an NBC News analysis . \nSpicer said the president has not always golfed when he travels to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, or to Trump National Golf Club outside of Washington. And at times, Spicer said, he's hit the links to serve the interests of the nation – such as when he brought Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in February. \n[ READ: FBI Director Confirms Investigation Into Trump-Russia Ties ] \n\"You saw him utilize this as an opportunity with Prime Minister Abe to help foster deeper relationships ... in Asia and have a growing relationship that's going to help U.S. interests,\" Spicer said during a briefing with reporters at the White House on Monday. \"How you use the game of golf is something he's talked about.\" \nBefore running for office, Trump often criticized then-President Barack Obama for frequent rounds of golf. Obama played 333 rounds of golf in office – most often at the course at Joint Base Andrews a short helicopter ride away from the White House – an average of 41 rounds a year. \nThen a reality television star and business mogul, Trump tweeted numerous times accusing Obama of shirking his presidential duties in exchange for golfing. Trump today made his 10th trip a Trump-owned golf course in 8 weeks as president.Here are his previous tweets about presidents and golf: pic.twitter.com/VTV5hAVx20 — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 18, 2017 \nAfter meeting with Abe – his first golf trip in office – Trump said that his choice of companions made his golfing different than Obama's. \n\"Well, I always said about President Obama, it's great to play golf, but play golf with heads of countries,\" he told Republican lawmakers at a Feb. 16 listening session. \"And, by the way, people like yourself, when you're looking for votes, don't play with your friends who you play with every week.\" \nOn Monday, Spicer also highlighted a trip to the Virginia club on March 11, when Trump met with several members of his senior staff, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin , Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly , Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin , according to pool reports, an event Spicer at the time termed a \"working lunch\" and on Monday called a \"mini-Cabinet meeting.\" \n\"I remember so many people jumping to the conclusion that he's going down and playing golf,\" Spicer said Monday. \"So on a couple of occasions, he's actually conducted meetings there, he's actually had phone calls. So just because he heads there doesn't mean that that's what's happening.\" RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Comey: 'No Information' to Back Trump Wiretap Claims ] \nThe White House has been criticized for releasing only vague details of his activities when traveling to his properties and sometimes refusing to respond to questions about whether he had golfed. After declining to answer questions about whether the president had golfed in Florida Saturday, a White House press aide told reporters Trump may have \"hit a few balls\" after a club guest shared a photo of him dressed to play . \nOn Monday, Spicer said the reason for releasing few details on the trips – even when Trump is said to be holding high-level calls and meetings, is \"the same reason he can have dinner or lunch with somebody, because I think the president's entitled to a bit of privacy at some point.\" \nIt \"is what we've always agreed to,\" Spicer said. \"We bring the protective pool to be there, but the president's entitled to bit of privacy as well.\" \nAsked by a reporter whether Trump intended to cut back his travel, given the costs and the fact that the president has proposed significant cuts to social and arts programs in his budget , Spicer dismissed the suggestion. \n\"Presidents always travel. And I think the president – wherever he goes, he carries the apparatus of the White House with us, that is just something that happens,\" Spicer said. \"The president will continue to go and travel around the country and have meetings to solve the nation's problems.\" \n\"I get it,\" Spicer said of the criticism, \"but at the same time, the president's very clearly that he's worked seven days a week. This is where he goes to see his family. He brings people down there. This is part of being president.\" Gabrielle Levy Political Reporter \nGabrielle Levy covers politics for U.S. News & World Report.
