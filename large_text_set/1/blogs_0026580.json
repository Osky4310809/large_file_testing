One of the best anime series of this past spring season was undoubtedly Berserk , the continuation of the original 26-episode series that adapted the original manga by Kentaro Miura. It only ran for thirteen episodes and left us with a bit of a cliffhanger, right before the real action was poised to begin.\nYou don’t have to wait much longer to see what’s going to happen to Guts, Casca, Griffith and the rest of the crew, though. You don’t even have to crack the cover of a manga volume. You can sit and wait for April to roll around when the show’s next season will premiere in Japan on MBS and WOWOW, Japanese television networks. The official website was updated since to show off the story’s Berserker Armor, as seen in the image above. There’s going to be some real carnage going on, and I can’t wait to check it out.\nFor the uninitiated, Berserk is one of the greatest Western fantasy-inspired anime series out there, and this is the second season of the new series that debuted in July 2016. It picks up right where the end of the original series left off, so if you plan on watching this series, it’s highly recommended you at least watch the Berserk movie trilogy or at the very least read the manga and watch the old series first.\nIt’s a show you won’t soon forget, and I liked it so much I got the sacred brand protagonist Guts has himself on my upper arm as a tattoo. If you like your anime disturbing, dark, and more than a little crazy, then you’ll find plenty to love about Berserk . You’ve still got plenty of time to get ready for the second season, so I highly suggest you go ahead and get ready now.
