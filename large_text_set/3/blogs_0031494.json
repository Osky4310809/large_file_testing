But I've noticed Carra's started wearing wax on Sky Sports so he might take that mantle.\" \nMcManaman and Owen, who both played at Real Madrid, agreed on Guti. \"I'm so pretty.\" (Photo: Getty Images Sport) \nMcManaman said: \"Certainly would have been Guti. He was never out of the mirror.\" \nOwen added: \"Oh, Guti. Definitely him. He had a mirror right next to his space in the dressing room.\" Steven Gerrard spills the beans (Photo: Nivea Men) \nWhen the question of 'Who is the least vain footballer you've ever played with' came round, Gerrard hadn't finished ribbing Carragher. \nHe said Carragher used to be the least vain footballer he's ever played with but added: \"Since he's gone into the showbiz world I've noticed he's taken a few grey hairs out and added a bit of wax to that basic carpet he's wearing.\" \nNIVEA MEN were an Official Partner of the LFC Foundation Legends Charity Match between Liverpool FC & Real Madrid.
