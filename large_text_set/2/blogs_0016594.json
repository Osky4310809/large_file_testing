Steve \nBecause of Brennan Manning’s passing I started to reread Ruthless Trust. I have to admit that at times I have not related to God as a loving Father. Manning reminded to again approach God as Abba and forget about jumping through hoops and trying to live the live the Christian life in my own strength. http://debrasblogpureandsimple.blogspot.com Debra \nRegarding Brennan’a photographic memory… Years ago Brennan and I ministered together at a spiritual retreat. Off the cuff, I heard myself telling the audience, “We always hear teens declaring nowadays, Get real! But what does that mean? When the Velveteen Rabbit asked the Skin Horse, ‘What is real?’ The Skin Horse replied…” (Uh oh, I don’t remember that exact passage; what was I thinking)? That’s when God stepped in and saved the day. By instinct, I handed the mic over to Brennan, seated next to me, who miraculously supplied the unscripted answer. “Real isn’t how you’re made… It’s a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real…It doesn’t happen all at once…You become. It takes a long time. “That’s why it doesn’t often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are Real, you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.” The audience burst into wild applause. God had orchestrated the whole thing in advance, I now know. I also realize that it isn’t the spectacular or the sensational that we seek. It’s the supernatural power of Love working in us to accomplish His purposes. http://www.convergingzone.com Robert Ricciardelli \nLoved the guy, great tribute Frank. I also love a guy named Frank Viola that writes things that move me. Sally Roach \nSo sorry to hear this. It was a desire of mine to meet him one day. My husband I were introduced to Brennan Manning through one of his books, “The Lion and Lamb”. We bawled through the entire book so I guess you can say what he wrote moved us. http://anitamathias.com Anita Mathias \n“If you write something and it doesn’t move you, then throw it in the trash. It’s not going to move anyone else.” Wow. That’s brilliant advice for blogging in particular! Love this post! \nTha’s a great book. http://www.thesharing.org J Rock \nI read his book “Ragamuffin Gospel” and it forever changes my life in understanding the grace of our God.
