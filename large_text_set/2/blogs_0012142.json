While it may be true that green-card holders (and certain temporarily admitted aliens) cannot be blocked from entry based on a general “national interest” determination, the due-process rights of other foreigners not already on American soil are exceedingly limited. Photo Protesters last week outside the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times For this group of aliens, the travel ban did not violate due-process rights. The court could have given Mr. Trump an easy victory by protecting only green-card holders (and the temporarily admitted aliens) from the ban, as the government suggested it do. The court refused because the government failed to make clear in the executive order that green-card holders would be exempted. But this is a non sequitur. As the respected former federal appellate judge Michael McConnell notes , the ban’s challengers were legally entitled to a judicial order that blocked only illegal portions of the ban. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story By resting on due process, the court was able to block the travel ban without addressing a more explosive argument. The court noted that “the states have offered evidence of numerous statements by the president about his intent to implement a ‘Muslim ban,’ ” but declined to resolve this claim “in light of the sensitive interests involved.” The “sensitive interests” did not hold back a Federal District Court in Virginia. In an opinion issued on Monday, the court ruled that the president acted with animus against Muslims when he issued the travel ban. The court laid out the damning evidence: the campaign statement calling for a Muslim ban, which is still on the web ; Rudolph Giuliani’s acknowledgment that the travel ban was really a Muslim ban; the failure of the lawyers who wrote the ban to consult national-security officials; and Mr. Trump’s statements in interviews. This is surely the first time in history that a court has found that a president acted out of bigotry. Yet the ruling contradicts the Supreme Court’s admonition that courts may not “look behind” a “facially legitimate” reason — here, the national security interest in stricter vetting — when the president exercises immigration authority. Does this mean President Trump is right to complain that the courts are political? Not exactly. The courts were playing politics, but of a valid constitutional kind.
