By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 14, 2017 9:54 AM Kithaganahalli Vasu was killed by unidentified people in Bengaluru on Monday morning. (Source: Twitter) \nBJP member Kithaganahalli Vasu was reportedly killed in Bengaluru. The news came after he was kidnapped by some unidentified people. The news was confirmed by Bengaluru’s Surya City Police station on Tuesday morning. However, the police are yet to identify people who were involving in hacking and killing of the BJP member. \nThere has been a political instability in South Indian states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala for some time now and with this incident, Karnataka has also joined the list. According to the reports, Kithaganahalli Vasu was hacked to death in a brutal manner. The police administration is looking into the matter and is trying to find the people behind the incident. \nYou may also want to watch: \nKerala has been a witnessing more incidents of political violence than any other state. Many attacks have been reported against the BJP members over the last one month with the latest one on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Kannur Mandal Vice President Sushil. He was attacked on 8th March in Olachery Kavu in an extremely violent manner. He was thrashed and left grotesquely bloodied. The doctors revealed that his face was swollen after being beaten while one of his arms was entirely cased in plaster. \nThese clashes started when an RSS leader Kundan Chandravat’s video went viral on social media. In this video, he said the Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is behind the killing of RSS workers and placed a bounty of Rs 1 Crore on him. However, he later apologised for his statement by saying, “I was pained on the issue of murders of Swayamsevaks and therefore made an emotional statement. I retract it (statement) and express my regret.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:27:24.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
