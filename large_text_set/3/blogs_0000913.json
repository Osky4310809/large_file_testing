He rang in the year in a rather special and different way. He threw a pre-birthday party to celebrate this occasion with his fans. There were over 2000 fans who wanted to come to this but the number was limited to a lucky 50. They sang, danced, played games, made merry, and of course, got to spend time with their favourite. Here are photos of them having a blast!

And I am quite happy I finally got the opportunity to celebrate my birthday with them! It always feels great to see the love and enthusiasm they shower upon me. \nAwww!
