The baby was delivered on the last day of 2015 by an obstetrician surnamed Liu. As the newborn had one day to a full-term, Liu put an oxygen mask on him to help him breathe easily. But she was surprised to see the baby holding the mask with his fingers. So she took the photos and posted them online and said, \"When the baby is trying so hard, I will work harder in the new year.\" [Photo/IC]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T15:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T03:39:38.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
