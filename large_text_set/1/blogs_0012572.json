The intersection of roadway and railroad track, so the story goes, was the site of a tragic accident in which several school-aged children were killed - but their ghosts linger at the spot and will push idled cars across the tracks, even though the path is uphill. \nThe story may be just the stuff of urban legend, but the accounts were intriguing enough that I wrote an article about the phenomenon, \"The Haunted Railroad Crossing.\" The article included a photograph submitted by Andy and Debi Chesney. Their daughter and some of her friends had recently been to the crossing to test the legend, and she took some photographs. Inexplicably, a strange, transparent figure turned up in one of the photos. \"They had no idea that it was in the picture until the next day when I printed out the picture and showed them,\" said the Chesneys. \"It was really freaky. It appears to be a little girl carrying a teddy bear.\" \nOther readers who have viewed the photo think it shows a little girl with a dog sitting at her feet. What do you think?
