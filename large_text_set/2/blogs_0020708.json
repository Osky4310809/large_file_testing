I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!” Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nPerhaps Trump's compliment was sincere: on Wednesady Trump weighed in on the DNC chair election, praising Keith Ellison for his 2015 prediction that Trump could win the Republican nomination. “One thing I will say about Rep. Keith Ellison, in his fight to lead the DNC, is that he was the one who predicted early that I would win!” \nThen again perhaps not, because shortly after Trump's tweet, Perez - best known during the Obama administration for getting accolades for \"seasonally adjusting\" America's transformation into a part-time worker society, responded as follows: \"Call me Tom. And don't get too happy. @keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare\" Call me Tom. And don't get too happy. @keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare. https://t.co/fu7WvLofrD \n— Tom Perez (@TomPerez) February 25, 2017 \nAnd just like that, another classic Twitter war was born, because while Americans may await (a long time) for Trump's economic plans to be implemented, they will surely be entertained.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:56:03.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
