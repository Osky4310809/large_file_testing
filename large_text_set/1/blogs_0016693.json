The party's leaders faced crowds ranging in size from dozens to thousands of people, urging them to call Republicans and protest the push for repeal. [...] \nIn Bowie [Maryland], a number of rally attendees said they were also planning to join the Women's March to be held in Washington, D.C., the day after Trump's inauguration. [...] \n… some of the loudest cheers came when Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said he \"might end up voting to impeach\" Trump, and one activist interrupted House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer and urged him to \"boycott the inauguration\" like Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. \nIn Boston, Sen. Elizabeth Warren told more than 6,000 people: \n“We knew these fights were coming, and now the first one is here,” Warren told the crowd, “We will fight them every step of the way.” \nEvery. Damn. Step. \nMeanwhile, in Colorado, Republican Rep. Mike Coffman, ran away rather than facing his constituents who wanted to tell him to keep his grubby hands off their health care.
