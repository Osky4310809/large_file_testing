Though he's not part of any environmental group, he felt compelled to share what he saw with authorities. He says the beach is covered in bits of coal and what he believes to be fine black coal dust.\n\"It's very alarming,\" he said. \"There's coal, potential coal dust and plastic pollution from the streets. \"All these awful things happening on the one beach.\"\nImage: Lance Payne\nScientists largely regard coal as having a toxic affect on marine plants and animals.\n\"It is simply not good enough for coal to be washing up on beaches in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area,\" WWF Australia head of oceans Richard Leck said in a statement. \"Coal is a potentially toxic material for marine life and must be managed in a way that stops it ending up in Reef waters.\"\nThe WFF is calling for a government investigation into the matter, as well as infrastructure changes to prevent coal spillages at nearby mining ports.\nLance's photo comes as the Queensland government found a coal spillage at a mining port in waters near the Reef, ABC reported . The coal appears to have spilled from one of the ship loaders at Hay Point Coal port, as well as spillages from trestles carrying the coal to ship loaders.\nThe WWF said coal has washed up at East Point Beach and Louisa Creek Beach, not far from the Hay Point Coal port. Environment Minister Steven Miles told the ABC it was not yet possible to say whether Hay Point was the source of the coal.\nFederal and state governments have given the go-ahead to a number of coal ports close by the Reef, including the Abbot Point coal terminal .\nThe terminal will serve the Adani's Carmichael coal mine, which will be one of the world's largest if completed.\nImage: Lance Payne\nA coal spillage near a World Heritage-listed marine park is always unwelcome, but parts of the Reef are also recovering from a global coral bleaching event.\nWhen stressed by environmental factors such as rising water temperatures and pollution, coal can expel the algae that lives in its tissues, providing it colour and nutrients. Exposing its white skeleton, bleaching leaves coral more vulnerable to disease.\nIn November, it was announced that the Reef had suffered its largest die-off on record. Its northern section was estimated to lose 67 percent of its shallow water corals. Coral can recover from bleaching, provided it's not exposed to further stresses.\nThe appearance of coal is unwelcome under any circumstances, even in sections of the reef not worst hit by bleaching.\n\"Beginning your first moments as a hatchling beside a lump of coal is not the best start to life,\" Leck said.\nBONUS: All electric trains in the Netherlands are entirely wind-powered", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E_iw72cZ8fcagUbc4CA-4xTTq6Q=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F377206%2F385d10ce-5fae-462e-b3cd-4f4cf93c1823.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GX0h9dsPiwhqvRn92dLCAfKn1BE=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F377206%2F385d10ce-5fae-462e-b3cd-4f4cf93c1823.jpg", "http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25894", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/massive-abbot-point-coal-port-expansion-gets-federal-approval/7047380", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-08/great-barrier-reef-coal-spillage-discovered-in-waters/8248546", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/fVb3VZiI.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/k-YEqFbJNcgHlaoo4bHbeSCowvQ=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F377234%2F9145c82e-a523-4e64-a217-a8122f9b2a75.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_piQrMnBkbhR7hKnug-9CN8tSEQ=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F377234%2F9145c82e-a523-4e64-a217-a8122f9b2a75.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/fVb3VZiI.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-09T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:24:32.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
