Self-employed Kelly Gilmour-Grassam (Photo: MEN) \nKelly Gilmour-Grassam, 24, a director of copywriting agency Making You Content, based near Manchester, will pay higher NI contributions. \nShe said: “The Chancellor claims Britain is open for business but sent an unwelcoming message to entrepreneurs. Business owners are taking risks and driving the economy. \n“They don’t get the same support as employees, like when they go on maternity. It seems short-sighted to short-change the self-employed, as the Government will rely so heavily on businesses in the wake of Brexit .“ Family on benefits Gemma and Michael Andrews (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nGemma, 32, and Michael Andrews, 30, from Chesterfield, Derbys, rely on benefits for them and their children, aged 13, 11, three and nine-months. \nMichael is full-time carer for Gemma, who can’t work due to intracranial hypertension. They have been hit by the rise in cigarette duty. \nGemma said: “I feel like we have been forgotten as the Chancellor didn’t mention people on benefits. It may only be £17 a year but that’s still a big blow to us.” Pensioners Ron Green and his wife Sue (Photo: Albanpix) \nRon Green, 84, and wife Sue, 73, live in Thetford, Norfolk. They manage to make ends meet by being careful with every penny, and nothing announced yesterday changes their situation. \nSue said: “I’m upset there was nothing for us. I’m finding it a challenge to balance our budget as prices continue to rise for essentials. \n“Luckily, we are not extravagant and I’m good at digging out the best deals. We could have done with a break from the scrimping and saving. I guess we’ll have to keep muddling along.” Disability benefits Poppy Hasted \nPoppy Hasted, 56, from Lambeth, South London, has suffered with multiple sclerosis since 1985. \nShe said: “The Budget barely applied to me. Being in receipt of social care services, the cash injection for social care is great news but only if it trickles down to us. I don’t claim tax credits, I don’t drive, smoke and rarely drink. \n\" I feel I’m being punished for being disabled. It would be nice if we stopped getting the bare minimum, giving us a bit more freedom to live.” \nPoppy will be worse off due to the increase in alcohol duty. Public sector Emmeline Martin \nEmmeline Martin, 32, is a community nurse and lives in Staffordshire. After working as a purchasing manager for a global chemical company she took a huge pay cut to work for the NHS. \nEmmelin, who will be worse off due to the alcohol duty rise, said: “It was an empty Budget. The Chancellor should have focused more on the figures than his jokes. \n\"It makes me cross to hear the Tories refer to themselves as the NHS party. How can nursing be seen as a viable career when a pay rise of 1% is less than half forecast inflation at 2.4%?” Social care Claudia Brookes (Photo: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror) \nClaudia Brookes, 33, is a photography tutor and lives in Lewisham, south east London. \nHer mother’s breast cancer has spread to her bones and she is reliant on visits from care workers to her home in Surrey. \nClaudia, who is left worse off by the rise in alcohol duty, said: “The social care funding is welcome but it’s not exactly a long-term plan. \n“I was also hoping the Government would help people get on the property ladder, especially key workers. I don’t get paid for the holidays so it’s difficult to get a mortgage.” 20-something Natalie Gorman \nNatalie Gorman, 26, is an account manager from Hounslow, West London. She has a one-year-old son with husband Wayne, 31, and they are expecting a second child in August. \nNatalie said: “We’ve already been looking at how we can reign in our costs. It would’ve been nice to be better off. \n“The big issue for us aside from childcare is getting on the housing ladder. We couldn’t buy a house in London and don’t want to leave our families. There was no mention of housing, so we feel let down.” Small business Carl Mitchell (Photo: Andy Commins/Daily Mirror) \nCarl Mitchell, 52, and wife Lisa, 45, have children aged nine and seven. The couple run two small shops, Escape Boutique and Mitchells Menswear, in Whitley Bay, Tyne & Wear, hit with rate hikes. \nCarl said: “We were hoping our business rate rise, which will be around £2,000, would be reduced – but no such luck. It’s disappointing there wasn’t anything that would have helped high street independents like us. \n\"It’s tough as we are competing against online and the big stores.” Single mum Helen Fletcher (Photo: Daily Mirror/SWNS) \nHelen Fletcher, 42, juggles two part-time jobs with bringing up her two children, Mia, 12, and Tom, eight, in Lincolnshire. \nShe said she ends up relying on her credit card every month to make ends meet – and will keep on doing so as the Budget has made no difference for her. \nHelen said: “It’s a good job we aren’t worse off as there is nothing else I can cut back on. It’s going to be tough as prices for food, fuel and other essentials are rising but there’s no extra cash to pay for them. I guess I’ll have to carry on building up debt on the credit card.” Working family Marcus Greenhalgh and family (Photo: Liz Henson Photography) \nMarcus Greenhalgh, 45 lives with wife Kate, 36, a full-time mum, and children Meg, eight, Martha, five, and Cecily, three, in Ramsbottom, Lancs. \nThe increase in alcohol duty will leave them £17 a year worse off and Marcus said: “I don’t want to have to cut back on anything else but food bills are creeping up, energy bills are rising and council tax will be hiked. \n\"Every price rise takes money away from doing family things. I don’t like having to cut fun things for the kids.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:40:22.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
