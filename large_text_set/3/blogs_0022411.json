These raw key lime pie bars require no baking, are gluten-free, refined sugar-free, and totally delicious! The creamy filling is made with macadamia nuts, which offer up more of a tropical and creamy taste than raw cashews. Taking a bite into one of these is like biting into a rich and creamy ice cream bar! They also store great in the freezer for weeks (or even months … if they last that long). Raw Key Lime Pie Bars [Vegan, Gluten-Free] This Recipe is : 9 large or 12 small Ingredients 1 cup raw macadamia nuts 3/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut 3/4 cup dates 1 1/2 cups raw macadamia nuts (or raw cashew nuts), soaked overnight in water 1/2 cup fresh squeezed key lime juice or regular lime juice 1/2 cup light coconut milk (from a can) 1/4 cup coconut oil 1/4 cup brown rice syrup or maple syrup (to make it grain-free) 1 teaspoon matcha powder or green food coloring (optional) Preparation Line an 8×8-inch pan with parchment paper. In a food processor, pulse together the macadamia nuts, shredded coconut, dates, and salt until it forms a sticky dough. Press into an even layer at the bottom of your pan. Place in the refrigerator while you prepare the filling. Drain the soaked macadamia nuts. Add the nuts, lime juice, coconut milk, coconut oil, brown rice syrup, and matcha powder to your food processor, or high-speed blender. Blend together until it forms a thick cream.
