To celebrate the launch, the band stopped by BBC’s Radio 1 for a performance of lead single “On Hold.” But that wasn’t all they got up to. The xx surprised the world with a cover of Drake and Rihanna’s “Too Good.” Head over to BBC’s Radio 1 Channel to give it a listen, tune in at 2:14:45.\nThis is not the first time that the band has crossed paths with Drake and Rihanna. Drake’s song “Take Care,” from his excellent album of the same name, which featured Rihanna on guest vocals was built entirely from a sample of “I’ll Take Care of U,” the closing track from Jamie xx’s remix album We’re New Here . Would a full-on Drake covers album be too much to ask?\nWatch the music video for “On Hold” below.\n\nIn other music news, SZA has announced her new album and shared a single titled “Drew Barrymore.” Listen to it right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T19:08:00.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
