NBAE 5 San Antonio Spurs \nLast week, we broke down why the Spurs aren't real title contenders , so we won't belabor the point here. \nYes, San Antonio is good enough to win the championship if everything breaks the Spurs' way, but that's true of every team on this list. \nThe Spurs simply don't have the athleticism or help for Kawhi Leonard they need to make it through the postseason, and LaMarcus Aldridge isn't the answer. Sorry, San Antonio fans. Winslow Townson Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports 4 Boston Celtics \nThe Celtics can't rebound and they're far less skilled than the Cavaliers. In fact, Boston has one shot at knocking off Cleveland in the postseason. \nIsaiah Thomas has to outplay Kyrie Irving to the extent that the Cavs point guard decides to defend his honor, hijacking the Cleveland offense along the way and infuriating LeBron James. \nOtherwise? Boston's not making it out of the East. AP Washington Wizards \nYou're underrating the Wizards, probably because they had such a putrid start to the season. \nJohn Wall (2) can match Kyrie Irving, Marcin Gortat can best Tristan Thompson, Markieff Morris can throw Kevin Love off his game, Otto Porter can be the glue guy, and Bradley Beal can get hot at the right time. \nWe're not saying Washington should be favored over the Cavs. The Wizards almost certainly would come up short. \nBut if you're looking for the biggest threat to Cleveland in the East, it's not Boston. Sam Sharpe Sam Sharpe-USA TODAY Sports 2 Houston Rockets \nThe Rockets aren't great on defense and they're a one-man show on offense. So why would we rank them over the Spurs? \nIt comes down to variance. While San Antonio is going to try to beat the likes of the Warriors and Cavaliers in a classic, old-fashioned basketball game, Houston wants to shoot all of the 3-pointers and let the shots fall where they may. \nThe Rockets are like a tournament poker player who ramps up the all-in-based aggression when he knows he's outclassed by a superior opponent. When you know you're probably going to lose doing things the normal way, why not try something new? 1 Los Angeles Clippers \nYou're damn right: the Los Angeles Clippers are the biggest threat to the inevitable Warriors-Cavaliers Finals rematch. \nThat's really a reflection on how unlikely it is anyone but the Cavs and Warriors will make it to the Finals, to be fair. In order to beat one of the two superteams, you'll need superstars, size on the inside, 3-point shooting, the tenacity to get punched in the mouth while coming back for more, and a heaping helping of luck. \nOh, and if you can outcoach Steve Kerr, that's a plus as well. \nThe Clippers can be that team —but it's up to CP3 & Co. to decide whether they really can knock off Golden State. \nThey'll have to focus on the task at hand, eliminate the mental errors, and play the very best basketball of their Big Four era, sure. It's not likely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:39:40.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
