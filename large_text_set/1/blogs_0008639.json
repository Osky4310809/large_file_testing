After that they ran.” \nPolice, armed with the canine unit, tracked the suspects to an apartment building just a few blocks away at 296 Blake Boulevard. The duo refused to surrender, igniting a barricade situation involving the Ottawa Police SWAT team, “they didn’t want to surrender themselves to police so there are certain steps that we have to go through to work through it safely and effectively,” says the head of the Ottawa Police Robbery Unit Staff Sergeant Michael Haarbosch. \nAfer a four-hour stand-off, five people were handcuffed and eventually taken into police custody without any major issues. Police say one suspect suffered minor injuries during the arrest. \nThe Robbery Unit has now charged two people in connection with the armed robbery and one person in connection with the barricade incident. The two others taken into custody were eventually released without charges. \nDylan Meulmeester, 23, and Mathew Carlsson, 28, have both been charged with three counts of robbery, use of a firearm in commission with an offence and conspiracy. Carlsson is also charged with three counts of pointing a firearm, wearing a disguise, obstructing police officer and two counts of breach of undertaking. Meulmeester is also charged with wearing a disguise, two counts of breach of recognizance, obstructing a peace officer and personation. Police say more charges may be pending. \nCarlsson was previously wanted in connection with an October 30, 2016 robbery on Parkdale Avenue. \nCharges are pending against the third suspect in direct connection with the barricade incident. \nBack at Eastview Pizza, El-Salibi, still can’t believe how a robbery over a thousand dollars and smokes could turn into something so big, but he knows his family did the right thing, “there is a gun involved and we’re not stupid, he could kill us. We work hard to live not to die.” MOST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:39:13.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
