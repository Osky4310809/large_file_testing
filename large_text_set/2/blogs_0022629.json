Pacquiao returned from a brief retirement to defeat Jessie Vargas and win the WBO welterweight title for a third in November \nHowever, Pacquiao's aides insisted nothing had been confirmed and the eight-division champion has taken to social media to update his followers on events. My team and I are in negotiations with Amir Khan for our next fight. Further announcement coming soon. #TeamPacquiao pic.twitter.com/nW5jpmwVJs â€” Manny Pacquiao (@mannypacquiao) February 23, 2017 \n\"My team and I are in negotiations with Amir Khan for our next fight. Further announcements coming soon,\" Pacquiao, 38, said on his official Twitter feed. \nA business adviser of the 38-year-old said earlier this week that Pacquiao's next opponent would \"most likely\" be Khan in Dubai. Khan stepped up in weight in his last fight against Canelo Alvarez but was stopped in six rounds by the WBC middleweight champion \nThe 67-fight (59-6-2) veteran tweeted on February 11: \"See you in UAE for my next fight. #TeamPacquiao\". \nKhan (31-4-0) was chosen as Pacquiao's preferred next opponent by fans in a recent poll on the Filipino's Twitter feed. \nFormer WBA and IBF light welterweight champion Khan responded to the latest developments by posting a cryptic picture of a Pac-Man arcade console with the comment \"Time to play\". \nHe later added another tweet, which said: \"Currently negotiating with Manny #teampacquiao. Coming soon.
