Their words of wisdom aligned perfectly with the theme of the workshop, “Disney Sings,” in which students are immersed in a “real world” performance experience and record a portion of a Disney film soundtrack.\nThe 2017 Music In Our Schools Tour includes 10 stops across the country between, mid-February and April. Give a Note Foundation leads the tour efforts in collaboration with Radio Disney and the Country Music Association in support of music education programs in schools across the nation. Each tour stop will include community concert events and music program grants, with highlights of the tour airing during the Radio Disney Music Awards in April on Disney Channel. \nFor the Wadsworth High School choir, the tour kick-off will be one it will probably never forget. In addition to the appearance by Little Big Town, the choir learned valuable insights into the performing arts industry through the workshop. The workshops offered at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort , help young performing arts students unlock their full potential and inspire them to make their dreams come true.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:42:45.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
