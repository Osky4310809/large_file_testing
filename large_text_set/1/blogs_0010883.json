Better atmospheric conditions are expected on Thursday. Motorists violating the ban will be fined 1,500 kroner (£174). \nThis is the first time Oslo has implemented a ban of this type after the city council – made up of the Labour and Greens parties – agreed in principle in February 2016 on the use of such a measure. Oslo moves to ban cars from city centre within four years Read more \nWhile diesel cars emit less CO2 they emit more nitrogen dioxyde. \n“In Oslo, we can’t ask children, the elderly, and those suffering from respiratory problems to remain holed up at home because the air is too dangerous to breathe,” a Greens city councillor Lan Marie Nguyen Berg said. \nThe measure has angered some motorists, who were encouraged in 2006 by Norwegian authorities to opt for diesel vehicles, which at the time were considered a better environmental choice than petrol-fuelled cars. \n“Make up your minds. It wasn’t very long ago that diesel was recommended over petrol by Jens (Stoltenberg, Norway’s former prime minister, now Nato’s secretary general). Not sure you really know what is best,” wrote an annoyed Irene Signora Maier Tziotas on the Facebook page of the newspaper Verdens Gang. How are cities around the world tackling air pollution?

That led a lot of people buying a car that they can’t use now.” \nOther Norwegians were more philosophical. “Very good measure. We should introduce a permanent ban on diesel in all big cities. The fines should also be doubled,” Kenneth Tempel wrote on VG’s Facebook page. \nAccording to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, air pollution causes 185 premature deaths in Oslo each year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T15:01:29.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
