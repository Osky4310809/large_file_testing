The point is, he’s just not worth that kind of money, and very few players are.

While talks surrounding #Saints WR Brandin Cooks have garnered the attention, #Rams continue to speak with teams about CB Trumaine Johnson \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 10, 2017 \nHowever on Thursday, Johnson himself posted the following photo to his Snapchat story, insinuating that he’d heard something recently in regards to a possible trade. \n— Black Pete Carroll (@CharlesT2423) March 23, 2017 \n“Still on the trading block I hear! It’s all good! Control what i can control — message to myself!!! Rams Nation just want to say I appreciate you from STL – LA! Nothing but love! Can’t wait to hear what my future holds…” \nJohnson is certainly a talented cornerback and will be an asset to any secondary that he’s a part of, but the Rams have major needs at multiple positions and are without a first-round pick in this year’s draft – so by holding onto Johnson they’ve severely hamstrung themselves on other fronts. \nIf parting is inevitable, it will clearly be bittersweet for both Johnson and the fans – but it’s hard to argue that it would be the luckiest break the Rams could hope for.
