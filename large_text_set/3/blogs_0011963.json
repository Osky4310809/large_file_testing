CREDIT: AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais Today is the 71st day of the year, and 685 children and teenagers have already been shot since January 1.\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, a national database of fatal and nonfatal shootings, 108 children aged 0 to 11 and 577 teenagers aged 12 to 17 were injured or killed by a gun this year. That means, on average, nine young people have been shot per day so far this year.\nAltogether, there have been 11,250 gun incidents across the country, resulting in more than 2,870 deaths and over 5,550 injuries.\nThe statistics paint a bleak picture of gun violence in the U.S. at a time when President Donald Trump is expanding gun rights for people whose access to firearms was restricted under his predecessor . Reversing a decades-long FBI policy that prevented people with outstanding warrants from purchasing guns, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced last month that people with arrest warrants can now purchase guns in the state the warrant was issued. The DOJ also scrapped background checks for people with severe mental illnesses.\nGun violence against children is also happening at a time when Trump is working with the Congress to arm school teachers , despite evidence that the presence of more guns makes people less safe , very few shootings happen at K-12 schools , gunmen don’t typically strike gun-free school zones .\nMeanwhile, the National Rifle Association (NRA), the largest gun lobby in the country, has positioned itself as a pro-Trump “counter resistance” force .\nWithin days of the gun rights expansions in February, the NRA released an ad starring Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, which claims that Trump “has no more powerful ally than the NRA.” The ad features clips of anti-Trump protests and anti-Trump lawmakers and pundits before the words “we fight back” flash onscreen.\nhttps://medium.com/media/8f7adf28b74e5ad56fce7e1880b5c3ca/href Hundreds of kids have already been shot this year was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T16:29:55.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
