REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo \nHONG KONG Five Hong Kong Uber drivers were found guilty of illegally using their vehicles for commercial purposes by a local court on Friday, dealing a potential blow to Uber Technologies Inc's operations in the Asian financial hub. \nThe verdict comes less than a month after the multi-billion dollar ride-hailing service pulled out of Taiwan. \nUber, headquartered in San Francisco, has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia. \nThe judge, So Wai-tak, said the drivers' vehicles had been used for commercial purposes and that their insurance excluded commercial use leaving passengers unprotected. \nThe pressure against Uber in the China-ruled former British colony stems in part from local taxi drivers mounting protests against the online service for hurting their livelihoods. Uber has faced similar protests across the world. \nThe financial hub of Hong Kong, while dubbed one of the world's freest economies, has a tightly regulated taxi sector that is known for its relatively low fares compared with other global cities like London and New York. \nUber hasn't officially released figures on the size of its business in Hong Kong, but it is believed more than one million rides have so far been given with tens of thousands of registered drivers. \n(Reporting by Venus Wu and Sijia Jiang; Editing by James Pomfret and Randy Fabi) Next In Technology News After Snap IPO, U.S. regulator questions unequal voting rights \nWASHINGTON/BOSTON One of two current members of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission raised questions on Thursday for companies like Snap Inc that offer shareholders unequal voting rights, saying the agency should \"focus on how some innovations may prove detrimental to investors.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T10:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:32:56.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
