Elisabetta Villa/Getty Images \nThere's a secret invite-only version of Tinder for celebrities, models, and millionaires called \"Tinder Select.\" \nTechCrunch reports that the popular dating app operates quietly Tinder Select for its VIP users — cutting out ordinary users so its most in-demand date-hunters can swipe each others' profiles in peace. \nTinder has never publicised Tinder Select, but it seems to have been around for six months (or more). Last year, a Reddit user posted a photo of the user interface , asking what it is. \nIt works in essentially the same way as the normal Tinder. The only real change seems to be its colour scheme — it's blue rather than orange, with an \"S\" symbol rather than Tinder's flame logo. \nIt looks like this. _103/Reddit \nSo, how do you get in? Sorry — if you have to ask, you're probably out of luck.

All Tinder users have one — it's a secret rating of your desirability , as defined by the number of people right on you, among other factors. Being a celebrity or high-profile figure probably helps too. \nOne source with access to Tinder Select told TechCrunch it is for \"celebrities and people who do really well on Tinder.\" \nA Tinder spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T15:34:06.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
