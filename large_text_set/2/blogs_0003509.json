A barangay is considered to be the smallest administrative unit in the Philippines.” \nLapeña said the battle against drug abuse and trafficking at the community and street level begins in the barangays, however small in structure. \nThe BADAC must be composed of the barangay chairman as head and a barangay kagawad as vice chair. \nThe members are composed of a Sangguniang Kabataan chairman, school principal and representatives from non-governmental organizations, parents-teachers’ association and religious group. \nPresident Duterte tasked the PDEA to lead the drug war after he stripped the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) of the power to conduct anti-drug operations. \nThe suspension of Oplan Tokhang was due to the killing of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo allegedly by police officers and NBI agents. 3 drug suspects arrested \nThree drug suspects were arrested in separate anti-drug operations in Ilocos Sur, Occidental Mindoro and Sorsogon, on Wednesday. \nLapeña identified the suspects as Ronald Sining, 38; Heron Iñigo, 28, and Lawrence Mariano, 41. \nSining was arrested by PDEA agents at his residence in Barangay Bitalag, Bacnotan, Sorsogon. \nAuthorities said they seized an undetermined amount of shabu and marked money from Sining. \nIñigo was arrested after he sold P270 worth of shabu to an undercover agent in Barangay San Pedro City, Candon City, Ilocos Sur. \nMariano yielded P500 worth of shabu following a sting in Barangay San Roque, San Jose City in Occidental Mindoro.
