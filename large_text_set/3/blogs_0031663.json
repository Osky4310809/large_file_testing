Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMore than 1.5 million of Britain’s poorest families cut off their own power supply because they cannot afford to top up their meters, a watchdog reveals today. \nIndustry regulators could “do more” to help rising numbers of vulnerable consumers in the energy, water and financial protection markets, the National Audit Office says. \nIt found 1.6 million energy prepayment customers - often those on the lowest incomes - “self-disconnected” their supply at least once a year because they do not or cannot add cash to their meters. \nThe NAO’s inquiry into how firms cater for vulnerable consumers also discovered that three million disabled people had been denied insurance or charged extra because of their conditions. \nAlthough the industries offer discounted prices for customers on low incomes, criteria for who qualified varied among companies, awareness could be low and uptake was uneven, the NAO warned.

Scope research shows this can amount to a staggering £550 a month. \n“Whilst there has been some good progress, the Government and regulators across all markets need to do much more to support disabled people and increase awareness amongst businesses of how to better identify and serve disabled customers.” Read More Energy giant AREN'T ripping you off and DON'T make fat profits, claim former industry watchdogs Many families lack the cash to top up their pre-pay meters (Photo: Getty) \nNAO chief Amyas Morse said: “A significant number of vulnerable consumers are particularly susceptible to bad outcomes or experiences from regulated services such as energy, water, communications and financial services. \n“It can mean disproportionately high bills, lack of access or choice, and debt. \n“Regulators have improved their understanding of vulnerability, and have made some progress in working with their industries to improve support for vulnerable consumers. \n“Regulators and government, however, need to work closer together to clarify their respective responsibilities if overall support for vulnerable consumers is to be value for money.” \nThe Lib Dems called for the industry watchdogs to be scrapped.

This spiral of debt is happening because of the lack of action from a government distracted by Brexit and a set of useless regulators. \n“ Theresa May talks about an energy price crackdown and building a shared society that helps everyone, yet what is she doing on this whole agenda? Nothing, it’s all talk and no action. \n“The question we have to ask today about our watchdogs is this - if the watchdog doesn’t bark, is it time to put it down?” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:19:40.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
