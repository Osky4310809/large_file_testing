In it, Denny, who moved from the area in middle school and now lives in Burbank, Calif., returns home for a taste of a five-pound pork sandwich at Jake’s Sandwich Board , Spread Bagelry’s 14-pound Whale bagel with white fish salad and salmon, and a loaf of French toast stuffed with berries and cream cheese from the Trolley Car Diner . \nThese aren’t just big things,” Denny says. “These are things that are really well thought out. Unlike a Man Vs. Food , we’re not trying to find places that just serve a lot of something.” \nGinormous Food were looking to wrangle a host. They had heard his food podcast, March of the Pigs , which features Denny and guests from the entertainment industry talking food and going out to lunch. \nater, Ginormous Food was born. \nLouisville, Kentucky a city that Denny says was both his favorite and the most surprising during the filming of the first season’s seven-episode run. That episode features a huge burger from Mussel and Burger Bar , a massive hot brown from Gary’s on Spring , and copious amounts of roast beef from the Come Back Inn . \nI was blown away at how amazing their culinary scene is,” Denny says of the Louisville. “We couldn’t find a bad meal if we tried.” \nBaltimore , Richmond , Cincinnati , San Antonio , and Nashville . Believe it or not, the Nashville episode includes a cheesesteak as one of the episode’s titular delicacies. \nThe cheesesteak in the Nashville episode is almost sacrilegious in a sense because it’s a Philly cheesesteak, but it’s got Pittsburgh slaw on it,” Denny says. “So it’s sort of a Frankenstein. It’s not a real cheesesteak.” \n— especially as a food show host. \nYou kind of have to get used to everyone’s cheesesteak being an honorary interpretation,” he says. “Unless you’re inside Philly, you can’t really expect it to be to the letter of the law.” \n’t expect any kind of Bizarre Foods antics as Ginormous Food progresses. Just expect more sandwiches. \nI don’t know if I’m going to get into Andrew Zimmern territory,” Denny says. “But if you get it on some kind of bread, I think I’m legally required to eat it.” \nGinormous Food , “Philadelphia’s Beasts of the East,” airs Friday, Jan. 13 at 8 p.m. on Food Network. | Updated: our guidelines | Comments FAQ \nhic, profane, indecent or otherwise objectionable.
