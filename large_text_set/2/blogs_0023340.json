After a TJ Perkins vs. Shinsuke Nakamura match that was apparently taped for the March 22nd NXT episode, Nakamura was attacked by Andrade \"Cien\" Almas and NXT Champion Bobby Roode. They double teamed Nakamura until Balor arrived for the save to a big pop. See Also Full WWE NXT Spoilers from Tonight \nBalor clotheslined Almas out of the ring and faced off with Roode before hitting him with a Slingblade. Nakamura then hit the Kinshasa on Roode. Balor cut a promo and said he's coming back for what's his soon, presumably the WWE Universal Title. Balor added that he's not medically cleared to return but he will be back sooner than later. Balor then wished Shinsuke a happy birthday and ended it with a \"we are NXT!\" to the crowd. This segment with Balor was a dark segment. \nBelow are fan photos of Balor's return and a video WWE posted: A post shared by WWE (@wwe) on Feb 22, 2017 at 7:41pm PST â€” JJ Williams (@JJWilliamsWON) February 23, 2017 #NXTOrlando #NXTUCF @FinnBalor says he's not medically cleared bit he will be back sooner rather than later ... pic.twitter.com/ERHGWBlUT7", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:55:55.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
