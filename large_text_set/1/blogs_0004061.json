The store features the company’s “just walk out” technology, which uses a combination of machine vision, sensors, and data science to monitor shoppers in the store and then automatically charge their Amazon accounts for the things they take out of the shop. \nAs my colleague, Brian Heater, wrote last year : \nWith Go, a sort of culmination of those two efforts, Amazon becomes the largest presence in a recent trend to remove the lines (and human aspect) of checkout from the grocery shopping process, including Selfycart and, more prominently, Instacart , which has announced its intentions to move in that direction. The store will be open to all Amazon customers at some point early next year. If past instances are any indication, this could be the start of something big. \nThe Amazon Books stores serve a dual purpose for the company. They provide another testing ground for the company’s experiments with physical retail and become a showroom for the hardware projects that Amazon continues to roll out. \nIt’s worthwhile as the company pushes an increasingly integrated retail experience with Amazon at the center of an expanding web of services.
