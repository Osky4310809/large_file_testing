Gordon and Carter Page , co-host Brian Kilmeade asked Conway if the president was upset that “fringe players” have ties to Russia and “indirect ties to him.” \n“They have very attenuated contacts to the campaign that I managed for the last three months,” she noted. “I have spoken directly to the president and other senior officials about this. He doesn’t know these gentlemen. He didn’t work with them.” \nShe further explained that Spicer was right when he addressed it yesterday and while there are others named who were more involved with the campaign and White House, Conway wanted to know where the “nexus” was. \n“People are so quick to make that nexus,” the veteran pollster said. “We have conclusions still in search of evidence. That’s very dangerous because we didn’t learn anything more yesterday to show any kind of nexus.” \nIn the wake of FBI Director James Comey confirming that there is an investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian government, Spicer distanced Trump from those potentially involved. This included ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort , who Spicer described as having a very limited role for a limited amount of time. \nWatch the clip above, via Fox News. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:41:44.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
