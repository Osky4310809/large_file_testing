Late last night, extremely unverified rumors about President-Elect Donald Trump's extracurricular Russian hotel room activities were made public by BuzzFeed . To use a hot piece of 2017 vernacular, they were extra . \nThe claims were made by someone claiming to be a former British intelligence officer, in a dossier that has been circulating for months now ( Mother Jones first reported its existence in October 2016). Buzzfeed's decision to make public the contents of the dossier without verifying its contents raises profound issues about journalistic ethics, but that's a discussion for weightier minds than mine. You're here for piss talk, and I'm going to give it to you. \nThe document alleges Russia has been \"cultivating, supporting, and assisting\" Trump for five years, and that intelligence services have fed him information about his political opponents. It also claims that Russian intelligence gleaned some bedwetting-ly juicy kompromat (otherwise known as \"compromising material\") after Trump's stay in the bugged presidential suite of the Moscow Ritz Carlton Hotel. \nDuring this alleged stay, Trump apparently employed a number of sex workers to perform what the report describes as a \"'golden showers' (urination) show\" in front of him. The alleged reason for this ammonia-soaked performance? The dossier claims that Trump knew that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, \"whom he hated,\" had stayed in the same suite, and he wished to defile the hotel bed.

After all, they are the unfortunate souls who will have to unpeel customers' luxuriant toupees from any allegedly urine-soaked beds and blow dry them back into shape. \nBut is bedwetting ever acceptable in a five-star hotel? As I never stay in five-star hotels and am seldom publicly incontinent, I really don't know. Rather than be a piss-poor excuse for a journalist, I thought I'd find out by calling some fine establishments to find out their policies on golden showers. Here's what they had to say.

If I was a guest in one of your rooms and urinated in the bed, would that be okay? Yes, certainly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T11:13:45.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
