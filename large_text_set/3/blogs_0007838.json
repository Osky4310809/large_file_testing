In her spare time, she enjoys volunteering for STEM outreach programs, running, hiking, landscape photography, and cooking.\nHer favorite piece of advice? One of my favorite books, The Love of Life , by G.B. Talovich, consists of short stories that took place in ancient China, each with an important life lesson. Many stories taught me to respect all living creatures whether it be humans, animals, plants, and the environment around us. In this technological age of always-on connectivity, my advice would be to find opportunities to reconnect with Mother Nature. John Muir may have put it best: “In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.” \nChristine Kretz , Research Industry Leader, Computational Biology Christine is the Research Industry Leader for healthcare and life sciences and works with IBM Research teams globally in this industry.
