As a result, Pacyga has been charged with first degree criminal sexual behavior and the production of sexually abusive material.\nThe young adult may spend the rest of her life in prison if convicted. \nAccording to court documents, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is temporarily taking care of her child, as they look for the father.  \nPacyga will face charges as a second-time habitual offender for having been previously convicted of a felony home invasion, says Timothy Maat, Muskegon County Chief Assistant Prosecutor. \nOffenders charged with criminal sexual conduct can be sentenced to life in prison. A second charge of sexually abusive material carries a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison.\nBecause Pacyga is a habitual offender, the latter maximum is raised to 30 years.\nShe is scheduled to appear in court on Feb. 23 and will be sentenced by District Judge Geoffrey Nolan. \nThe case is similar to the 2012 Michigan conviction of Dan and Alisha Hall of Mt. Morris. \nThe couple was found guilty on all counts of sexually abusing their infant daughter and taking pictures of the abuse. \nAt the time, according to Michigan Live, Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton commented: \"It's senseless to think a couple could violate their own infant child. It's incomprehensible to me.\"  \nDuring court testimony, Daniel Hall had confessed to sexually abusing his then six-month-old daughter. \nInvestigators had uncovered more than 700 pictures of child pornography -- including 13 images of the father participating in sex acts with his daughter -- on the couple's home computers. \nHis wife, Alisha Hall, was then convicted for photographing the abuse and aiding the criminal acts. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T20:17:12.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
