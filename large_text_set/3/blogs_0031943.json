The cost surges to more than $300,000 to secure the 58-story building each day the president visits his family. \nRead: The Trumps' Love Life: Melania's Key To A Happy Marriage Is Using A Separate Bathroom \nNew Yorkers and activists have begun speaking out against the added cost of living, ordering Melania Trump to move in with her husband or start paying for her family's security in the Big Apple herself. \nPresident Donald Trump pumping his fist as he stepped from Air Force One with his son Barron (C) and wife Melania upon their arrival in West Palm Beach, Florida, March 17, 2017. Photo: Reuters \n\"The U.S. taxpayer is paying an exorbitant amount of money to protect the first lady in Trump Tower,\" a statement accompanying the online petition Tuesday said. \"As to help relieve the national debt, this expense yields no positive results for the nation and should be cut from being funded.\" \nMeanwhile, each of the president's trips to the \"Winter White House,\" Trump's luxury, members-only Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida, reportedly costs the public nearly $3 million. The total bill for those trips has topped $15 million just two months into his tenure in Washington, D.C. \nThe cost of protecting the first family also naturally increased to cover Trump's five children and wife, compared to former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama and their two children, all of whom lived in the White House throughout the entirety of his presidency. \nIt remained unclear whether the first lady would heed the call of her New York neighbors to pack up and move to the White House before the summer. Four of Trump's adult children live separately from the president and first lady, while Melania and Barron Trump reportedly plan to make the move to Washington, D.C. in June.
