And do it for the, yes, second straight year. \nIt’s at this moment when you should pause, look at the box score from Week 17 that shows a 24-17 Texans loss to the Tennessee Titans —the Matt Cassel-led Titans—and ponder an important question: Why do you watch football? \nYou watch for a lot of reasons. You watch because the strategy is compelling. You watch because there’s nothing more beautiful than a tip-toeing sideline catch on a precisely placed ball. You watch to see what creative way the Cleveland Browns can mercifully win a game, and then keep winning by losing a week later. \nMost of all, though, you watch to be entertained. \nIt might not seem like that's your motivation when the television is taking the brunt of brutal late-season anger. But you wouldn’t spend many hours on Sundays in the fall and winter carving an intricate couch groove if the product wasn’t entertaining. Early in the 2016 regular season the entertainment value fell, which is partly why ratings suffered as NFL viewers went elsewhere. \nAnd that could happen again at some point during the Texans’ divisional-round playoff game, regardless of their opponent. Because without quarterback play that even approaches a competent level, they slot in right alongside the worst playoff teams in recent memory. \nBut hey, at least they’ll get to be the answer to a trivia question, as NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo noted. That’s something! Texans will be the first team since the 1998 Dolphins to host a playoff game in a stadium that's hosting the Super Bowl. Crazy drought. — Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) December 25, 2016 \nThe Texans' awfulness and the reasons for it are rooted in their calamity at quarterback, which may have become worse if the concussion suffered by Tom Savage lingers. \nHis potential playoff absence comes after somewhat mysterious events. Savage was injured on a QB sneak early in the second quarter against the Titans. He went into the concussion protocol, was evaluated and then cleared to return. He was presumably fine and even came out to take a kneel down at the end of the half. \nThen he was evaluated again during halftime and didn’t return. The Texans’ PR Twitter account passed along what could be the nail in any playoff advancement hopes: . @HoustonTexans injury update: QB Tom Savage was reevaluated at halftime and is OUT with a concussion. — Texans PR (@TexansPR) January 1, 2017 \nSavage isn’t your typical inexperienced starter . But he still shouldn’t be put in a position where he has to become anything resembling an offensive savior. Yet that’s the hole Texans head coach Bill O’Brien was plunged into after Brock Osweiler cratered . \nOsweiler entered Week 17 with a completion percentage of 59.6 in 2016, and a passer rating of 71.4. He also came into the week with a woefully low average of 5.8 yards per attempt while throwing 16 interceptions (tied for fourth). \nHe was replaced by Savage because it felt like putting in a Jugs machine would have been more effective. It’s early yet to draw any conclusions on Savage following one measly start. But after 25 yards on eight attempts before his injury Sunday, and an average of only 6.1 yards per throw in Week 16 without a touchdown, he wasn’t starting off as the hero Houston needed. \nBut Savage is still the hero we all want. He represents the unknown, which means the man who bears a striking resemblance to Nicolas Cage gives those who like their playoff football to be entertaining (which again, is everyone) something special. \nSavage offers the gift of hope. No really, I mean it. \nI know it’s difficult to believe that based on what we saw from Savage’s first start and brief appearance Sunday. But please remember something critically important about an Osweiler -led offense. So important, in fact, that let’s first recall how great the Texans’ defense was during the 2016 regular season despite numerous injuries, most notably to all-solar system defensive end J.J. Watt. \nAs the friendly Texans PR account also reminded us, the Texans came into Week 17 with the league’s top-ranked defense despite having to use 14 different starting lineups: The @HoustonTexans rank as No.1 defense in @NFL in 2016 despite using 14 different starting lineups & having 20 different players start on D pic.twitter.com/kQsKOyulUB — Texans PR (@TexansPR) December 29, 2016 \nReally absorb that for a moment and soak in how punishing the Texans defense has been during far less than ideal circumstances. They allowed an average of only 20.5 points per game. \nBut the only purpose of that quality defense—besides, you know, keeping the team afloat—has been to highlight how uniquely pathetic the Texans have been offensively while wallowing for most of the season under Osweiler . Somehow even with that top-10 defense, the Texans still ended the season with a point differential of -49. \nThey did that by scoring 15 or fewer points in a game six times. That includes a Week 3 shutout loss to New England Patriots , and two other low-scoring affairs when the Texans scored 21 combined points with only one touchdown (Week 16 against the Cincinnati Bengals , and Week 7 against the Denver Broncos ). \nThey did it by scoring only 25 touchdowns all season and ranking last in that pretty important offensive measuring stick after 15 games. They did it by ending the season with two straight games when a stumbling Texans offense failed to record a single point in the first half. And Sunday the Texans left their defense dangling with a new offensive low: They recorded two drives that ended in negative yards. \nO’Brien doesn’t know who his playoff starter will be, and it might not matter. Much like January 2016 when we all had to endure a Brian Hoyer playoff start that ended in a 30-0 loss, the Texans are trending fast toward another playoff embarrassment. Bill O'Brien would not say who will start at quarterback next week, but said he and his coaching staff would discuss. — Sarah Barshop (@sarahbarshop) January 1, 2017 \nO’Brien did say running back Lamar Miller should be healed and ready to return from his ankle injury, via Sarah Barshop of ESPN.com. \nHis presence will certainly help after Miller logged four games with 100-plus rushing yards and finished with 1,073 yards on the ground overall. But it likely won’t be anywhere close to enough with only sporadic stretches when the offense presents a legitimate passing threat. \nAdd it all up—the defense that isn’t responsible for completing passes, the quarterbacks who are but can’t and the offense incapable of scoring with any consistency—and yes, the Texans just might be one of the worst playoff teams we’ ve watched in recent memory. \nThe 2014 Carolina Panthers were dreadful too, and became just the second playoff team in league history with a record below .500 at 7-9. But at least quarterback Cam Newton provided some excitement and a reason for us to keep our eyes open while he built toward his 2015 MVP season. \nThe 2010 Seattle Seahawks (also 7-9) were the first to limbo under that low bar. Then they gave the playoffs an instant jolt of energy when running back Marshawn Lynch did his Super Mario Bros. imitation on a 67-yard touchdown run that stood as the game winner during an upset win over the New Orleans Saints . \nWe’ ve also cringed while six 8-8 teams have made the playoffs in league history. The most recent was the 2011 Denver Broncos, which became magnetizing television at the height of # TebowTime . \nThe Texans don’t have Watt, they don’t have an NFL-caliber passing offense and they’ ve managed to drain the life out of DeAndre Hopkins, their wide receiver who could and should be a superstar. \nThey’ll host a playoff game, likely against the Derek Carr-less Oakland Raiders . Which is lucky, but also excruciating for you, the innocent viewer. That’s right, get your popcorn out for the possibility of…Brock Osweiler vs. Connor Cook?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T03:35:18.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
