Tough start for Boothroyd Boothroyd saw his side toil in Germany (Photo: Matthias Hangst / Getty) \nAidy Boothroyd won each of his two games in caretaker charge of the Under-21s - but his side found it tougher going in his first match as full-time boss. \nThe former Watford and Northampton manager impressed with England's U20s and graduated to the U21 role when Gareth Southgate moved up to take the top job. \nWins over Kazakhstan and Bosnia were relatively straightforward, but this was a much tougher test and, in truth, England struggled to keep up with their opponents at times. 2. Struggles for Abraham The U21s suffered the same fate as the seniors (Photo: Bongarts) \nTammy Abraham has had a startling breakthrough season with Bristol City and will surely go on to have a successful top-flight career. \nBut he struggled here, playing what was often a lone hand up front and feeding off scraps. \nHe has 19 strikes in 33 Championship appearances for the Robins but his lack of experience at the top level probably showed in Wiesbaden. 3. Germany impressive The Germans were very impressive (Photo: Bongarts) \nQuick, accurate, efficient... sound familiar? \nThis was a German display entirely typical of the principles we have become accustomed to watching their national team. \nAnd the style of play has clearly filtered its way down the age groups effectively. Maxi Arnold and goal scorer Nadiem Amiri were especially impressive. Could we be set for a period of domination from the Germans on the world stage? 4. Valuable test for Young Lions England will have learned a lot from this defeat (Photo: Alex Grimm) \nAlthough they were largely dominated - England will have learned a lot from this. \nA tough game like tonight, even coming out on the wrong side of the scoreboard, is surely better than hammering one of Europe's minnows at a lower-league ground on home soil. \nAnother test awaits in Denmark on Sunday as Aidy Boothroyd looks to figure out his strongest lineup ahead of the Euros in Poland this summer. 5. Tough week for England in Germany The U21s suffered the same fate as the seniors (Photo: Bongarts) \nWhether it's the seniors or the Under-21s - England haven't had the best week in Germany. \nGareth Southgate's Three Lions turned in a creditable display in Dortmund but were ultimately beaten by Lukas Podolski's thunderbolt. \nAnd another defeat followed this evening, in more convincing circumstances for the hosts. Let's hope for more joy at Wembley and in Denmark respectively before players go back to their clubs. poll loading Will England win the U21 Euros this summer? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:15:43.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
