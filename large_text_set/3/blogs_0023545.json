Disapproval, meanwhile, ticked up marginally, from 35 percent last week to 38 percent in the new survey. More voters, 22 percent, strongly disapprove of the bill than the 17 percent who strongly approve of it. Story Continued Below \nMore than one in five voters, 22 percent, are undecided — a slight, 3-point increase since last week. \nRepublicans continue to support to bill: 62 percent of GOP voters approve of the bill, while only 18 percent disapprove. And while Democratic opposition — 57 percent disapprove — lags Republicans’ backing, more Democrats strongly disapprove of the law, 40 percent, than Republicans who strongly approve, 28 percent. \nThe House is slated to vote on the GOP-drafted measure on Thursday, and leadership has expressed hope the bill will earn a majority of votes — despite uniform Democratic opposition and GOP dissension on the party’s ideological edges, especially its conservative wing. By Adriel Bettelheim and Jason Millman \nVoters are rankled by the House GOP’s compressed timeline. A 43 percent plurality say congressional Republicans “are moving too fast and need to take more time to examine other proposals.” Only 18 percent say “health care reform needs to be passed as soon as possible,” and 17 percent think Republicans “are going about the right speed on health care reform.” \nThe POLITICO/Morning Consult poll continues to show approval of the bill is narrowly greater than disapproval, but other surveys show far more respondents oppose the legislation than support it. Unlike the other polls, the POLITICO/Morning Consult survey does not identify the new proposal as a Republican effort. \nThe survey does show some movement on other perceptions of the bill — mostly in more negative directions. Thirty-six percent of voters think the bill would make the health care system worse, up from 33 percent last week. The percentage who say it would make the system better declined, from 34 percent last week to 30 percent in the new poll. \nForty-four percent of voters say the bill would result in a decrease in the number of Americans with health insurance, up from 38 percent last week. Only 22 percent of voters think more Americans would have health insurance under the GOP bill. \nThe new survey was conducted before House Republicans released a number of minor changes to the bill on Monday night but after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the bill would cut the deficit but result in tens of millions of fewer Americans on the insurance rolls. \n\"Not only has approval in the [American Health Care Act] decreased since the CBO score came out, Americans think Congress is moving too quickly on health care reform,\" said Morning Consult Co-founder and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. \"Republicans in Congress are in a tough position right now, but our polling indicates that voters are willing to give them more time to get it right.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:03:35.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
