teenager collapsed during a fight (Picture: Facebook) A teenage kickboxing champion has died after collapsing towards the end of a national competition.\nScott Marsden needed urgent medical attention during an English title fight in Leeds on Saturday.\nWomen golfers will finally be admitted to Muirfield The 14-year-old, who won a 50kg gold title at the World Kickboxing Association (WKA) finals in Spain, was fushed to hospital after blacking out in the final seconds.\nFamily friend, Charlotte Rowlett, paid tribute to the teenager after announcing that he died ‘surrounded by his family and people who love him’ yesterday.\nWest Yorkshire Police said the incident is not being treated as suspicious.\nScott Marsden with his parents (Picture: Facebook) A force spokesman said: ‘At 1.20pm on Sunday, police were contacted by medical staff at Leeds General Infirmary reporting a 14-year-old boy who was in a critical condition after collapsing during an organised kickboxing contest at Alexandra Mill, Morley, on Saturday night.\n‘Inquiries are being carried out into the circumstances.’\nPolice and paramedics filmed 'having a chat' while driving on motorway Scott is believed to be a member of Marsden’s All Styles Kickboxing, in Sheffield.\nThe club posted a statement on Facebook on Sunday, which said training was cancelled until further notice.\nA post written earlier in the day said: ‘Unfortunately, (Saturday) night’s English title fight had to be stopped due to Scotty needing immediate medical attention.\n‘There was no way to foresee the fight ending in such a way as at no point were either ever in any overwhelming danger from each other.\n‘Everyone is still in shock as there were simply no signs to suggest the fight needed to be stopped.\n‘The referee stepped in to protect Scott as soon as he could, which meant Scott did not hit the canvas and was laid down and straight into recovery position.\nThe champion died in hospital (Picture: Facebook) ‘Let’s please come together to support the Marsden family at this incredibly difficult time.\n‘No amount of money can ease the pain but let’s please do what we can.’\nCalvin Klein accused of sexualising children in new adverts Ms Rowlett has since set up a fundraising page for the family.\nShe said: ‘Everything Scotty did he did with passion and a confidence that was a pleasure to behold, he was the most wonderful, talented boy and the loss of him will leave a hole in so many people’s lives.\n‘Scott was not only a kick boxer though, he is a son, a brother, a grandson, a nephew, a cousin and a friend.\n‘No amount of money can take away the pain his family are feeling today and always, but no family should ever have to cater for coping with the loss of a 14 year old boy, with his whole life ahead of him.’",
