They’re facing the traffic, so it’s the driving public that’s going to be getting this message,” said Rick Leonardi, who opposes the design. \nThe bridge is on Villanova property, but will be paid for with both university and state money. \nThe design includes four crosses and neighbor Rich Leonardi believes it should be changed, calling it unconstitutional because of the separation of church and state. \nHis solution? \n“Turn them so they face the pedestrians,” Leonardi says. \nStudents though don’t think it’s a big deal. \n“I think it’s university property, so I think they should be able to do whatever they want,” said freshman, Chris Montie. \nNicole Baker says, “I can understand if people find an issue about it, but I really don’t see people going to war about it.” \nAnd with unanimous approval Monday night, it appears that war is over. \n“The design looks great. The crosses are going to go up there. Is it right or wrong? I don’t know. But at the end of the day it is on their property. They are a religious institution and the law for the most part is in their favor,” said Clark.
