Sarah Jessica Parker tried a throwback hairstyle for the 2017 Golden Globes. She wore crown braids with jewels accessorizing her part. The style was initially created as a nod to her mother's wedding hair, but she later realized it also draws inspiration from Princess Leia ( played by the late Carrie Fisher ). \nOn the NBC red carpet special, host Natalie Morales told Sarah Jessica, \"It almost looks Princess Leia inspired!\" \nThe actress responded, \"I didn't mean for that, perhaps it was in my subconscious. Actually there's a photograph of my mother getting married, and her hair is like this, so I mentioned it in conversation with Serge Normant, who does my hair. And though we didn't think we were going to do this, this ended up being what we did! So perhaps it's a tiny little nod at a very grand person.\" \nThat indeed! With fans everywhere mourning Carrie's recent death , we could not think of a better time to honor her most well-known role. \nFor makeup, SJP kept it classic with smudgy dark eyeliner and a pale matte pink lip color. \nKeep reading to see all angles of this gorgeous style that we hope continues to be re-created.
