Right when he was demoing this out, it immediately reminded me of one of our favorite bands of all time - Burnt By the Sun, I immediately fell in love with it. \n\"Heavy as two hells, the sickest, dirtiest riff in a long time. 'Andromeda' - tough as nails, thick as elephant skin, it's fantastic. That's my Bill Kelliher highlight riff of the album. It really blossoms into a song that wasn't pure heaviness - kind of goes off into these slightly trippy verses.\" \nThe track awaits below, along with two previously premiered singles - \" Sultan's Curse \" and \" Show Yourself .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:37:17.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
