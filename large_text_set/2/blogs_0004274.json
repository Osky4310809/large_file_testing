Sarah Larimer By Sarah Larimer February 6 at 4:58 PM Follow @slarimer \nThe Kremlin is demanding an apology from Fox News Monday, after Bill O'Reilly's one-on-one interview with President Trump on Super Bowl Sunday, in which the TV host called Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"killer.\" (Reuters) \nThe Kremlin says it would like an apology from Fox News after an interview between President Trump and Bill O’Reilly, in which the Fox host described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “killer.” \n“We consider such words by the Fox News company correspondent to be unacceptable and insulting,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a conference call, excerpts of which were published by Russian media. “And honestly, we would prefer to receive an apology addressed to the Russian president from such a respected television station.” \nThe interview between O’Reilly and Trump aired Sunday.

I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world, major fight — that’s a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea.” \n“He’s a killer though,” O’Reilly said. “Putin’s a killer.” \n“There are a lot of killers,” Trump said in response. “We’ve got a lot of killers. What, you think our country’s so innocent?” \nO’Reilly planned to address the matter on his show Monday night, Fox News confirmed in an email to The Washington Post. \nAs Reuters noted in its report : \nAsked in an interview on Sunday to clarify those comments, Trump told Westwood One Sports Radio: “Well, I don't have to clarify it. The question was do you respect him — he's a head of a major country.” \nPutin, in his 17th year of dominating the Russian political landscape, is accused by some Kremlin critics of ordering the killing of opponents. Putin and the Kremlin have repeatedly rejected those allegations as politically motivated and false. Gen. McCaffrey on Trump's Putin comments: \"The most anti-American statement every made by the President of the US.\" https://t.co/k2xNra1ynD pic.twitter.com/CM7RBGXQMS \n— John Aravosis (@aravosis) February 6, 2017 . @POTUS statement suggesting moral equivalence between Putin's Russia and the United States of America is deeply troubling and wrong. \nThe Kremlin's request for an apology comes about a week after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office wrote to Fox News , asking that it either take down or update a tweet that contained “false and misleading” information about the suspect in the Quebec City mosque attack . \nThe tweet stated that the suspect in the fatal shooting was “of Moroccan origin.” A man who was born in Morocco was initially detained in the aftermath of the attack, but he quickly released and cleared. The tweet stayed up for some time before Trudeau's office got involved. Fox, which said that it had sent a new tweet and corrected its story, deleted the erroneous tweet. \nJulie Vitkovskaya contributed to this report. \nRead More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:09:21.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
