With an expected price range of Rs 4-7 lakh, the Ignis will take on the likes of the Mahindra KUV100 , Hyundai Grand i10 and its own cousin, the Swift . Here’s a look at what’s on offer: Powertrains The Ignis is available with a familiar range of powertrain options i.e. a 1.2-litre petrol that makes 83PS of power at 6,000rpm and 113Nm of torque at 4,200rpm, along with a 1.3-litre diesel that makes 75PS at 4,000rpm and 190Nm of torque at 2,000rpm. Both engines come paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox as standard, but can be equipped with a 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) as well, though the latter is limited to the Delta and Zeta mid-range variants. The company claims an efficiency figure of 20.89kmpl for the petrol and 26.80kmpl for the diesel. Features With the Ignis, Maruti Suzuki is offering features like LED projector headlights with DRLs, dual-tone exterior paint shades and the ‘Smart Play’ touchscreen infotainment system that supports Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, MirrorLink and navigation. The kitty also includes a dual-tone dashboard, push-button starter and automatic climate control, while safety tech like dual front airbags, ABS with EBD and ISOFIX child seats mounts come as standard.
