It's a steep price to pay, but it's for one of the league's best all-around players.\nDelle Donne's move closer to her home in Delaware comes as no real shock, as rumors have leaked over the past few months that she was unhappy in Chicago. She was a restricted free agent and the Sky would have no reason to trade her unless she wanted out.\nEarlier on Monday, Washington sent Bria Hartley and Kia Vaughn to the New York Liberty as part of a three-team trade for the Seattle Storm's No. 6 and No. 18 picks to set up the subsequent blockbuster deal. The Storm received Liberty center Carolyn Swords and Washington's No. 15 pick.\nDelle Donne's move is a big one, and one that rarely happens with players of her superstar caliber. The most recent came two seasons ago when her former teammate Sylvia Fowles forced her team's hand as she sat out until she was traded to the Minnesota Lynx.\nDelle Donne didn't rule that option out, saying on Megdal's Locked on Women's Basketball podcast from two months ago:\n\"For me, obviously I always want to play. I don't want to sit out. I want to play the game I love and the game I work so hard on. So hopefully that doesn't have to occur in my future.\"\nLuckily for Delle Donne and the league, that's a decision she'll never have to make.\n\"[The Mystics] have a ton of potential,\" Delle Donne said on Megdal's podcast. \"A lot of young talent. I've always had a great relationship with Coach Thibault. He does a great job with the team and is always adding pieces to the puzzle. He's a coach that wins and he's going to get that team headed in the right direction.\"\nDelle Donne will pair up with Emma Meesseman to form one of the league's toughest front courts.\nThis story will be updated.
