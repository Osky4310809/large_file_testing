The government may feel pressure to introduce policies aimed at easing the hardships of India’s poor, who have been worst hit by the cash crunch, just days ahead of crucial state elections. Mr. Jaitley’s hand, however, will be constrained by the government’s tight purse strings. \nHere are five things to watch out for in the budget for Asia’s third-largest economy: 30 Jan 2017 9:00pm Anant Vijay Kala 1 A digital push \nThe government’s currency withdrawal decision was partly driven by a desire to have a more digitized economy, replacing cash transactions with digital ones. \nThe budget presents an opportunity to incentivize Indians to go cashless. HSBC says the government could introduce a referral bonus for adopting digital technologies or a waiver of transaction fees. Economists say a tax on large cash payments and limits on withdrawals could also be announced. While the steps may be well intended, how well they go down with people who are still feeling the pain of the cash shortage remains to be seen. 2 Tax on long-term capital gains \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi last month said people earning money from financial markets should “make a fair contribution to nation-building through taxes.” His comments sparked speculation that the government planned to impose a tax on long-term capital gains from securities transactions. \nAlthough Mr. Jaitley later said the inference being drawn from Mr. Modi’s comments was erroneous, investors are on the edge. If such a tax is introduced, it could lead to a market selloff, as investors look for newer markets without such taxes. 3 Rules to crack down on tax avoidance \nA new and controversial set of tax rules aimed at cracking down on avoidance are due to come into effect in India from April. The implementation of the rules–which aim to check on deals structured to avoid tax–has repeatedly been deferred due to concerns they could give authorities overarching powers or lead to harassment of investors. \nPast attempts to introduce the rules damped investor sentiment and many hoped their introduction would be deferred again. However on Friday, the government said it still plans to have them in place from April. \nDetails of the plan may be unveiled in the budget and such news could deal a fresh blow to markets, something the government can ill afford when it is looking to attract new investments to create millions of jobs. 4 Tax breaks for companies \nThe government has previously announced it plans to progressively cut taxes on companies to 25% from 30% to help local manufacturers become globally competitive. The first of those cuts is widely expected to come in this budget. \nBut giving companies room to breathe could be unpopular politically, unless income tax on individuals is also cut. The government has already faced criticism from opposition parties for favoring businesses and doing little for ordinary citizens. 5 Fiscal prudence \nThe government previously unveiled a roadmap for fiscal improvement, targeting a reduction in the budget deficit to 3% in the next fiscal year. \nHowever, with private investment showing no sign of a pickup, pressure to increase spending will be high. \nWeak activity in rural areas since November has added to the need for support for farmers. If the government does increase spending, the deficit target may have to be compromised. That is something investors won’t like.
