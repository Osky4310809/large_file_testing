Here is the CDPHE's graph of NSDUH prevalence numbers for teenagers, which also includes data from the Health Kids Colorado Survey (HKCS):\n\nNSDUH's sample of Colorado teenagers is much smaller than the one used in HKCS, which is why the prevalence estimates are three-year averages. But taken into account the margin of sampling error, neither survey shows an increase in adolescent marijuana use since legalization took effect at the end of 2012. The picture remains the same if you include the most recent NSDUH numbers , which show a statistically insignificant drop in past-month use between 2013-14 and 2014-15, the period when state-licensed marijuana stores began serving recreational consumers in Colorado.\nAnother hopeful development noted in the report: Marijuana-related calls to the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center, which rose after legalization for three years in a row, fell from 229 in 2015 to 201 in 2016. The center received 40 reports of marijuana exposures involving children 8 or younger last year, down from 48 in 2015.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T14:02:00.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
