Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki \nObaseki stated this when members of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, in Edo State, led by its chairman, Rowland Osakwe, paid him a courtesy visit. \nAccording to him, “A lot has been said about me not appointing commissioners and so many other issues. But the truth is that I decided to run for governorship at this time when things are so difficult because I believe that I can impact on the lives of our people. I have looked at the situation and said we must stop wastages and manage our resources in a manner that it will benefit the people. \n“In doing that, we needed to plan and say this is what we want from each of the ministries so that when a commissioner comes in, he will work according to the plans on ground. We are going to have a Government House in the 18 local government areas. That is why we are appointing special assistants in the 192 wards of the state so that every part of Edo State will feel the impact of government. \n“That is why we are holding workshops in different sectors of the state and the reports of these workshops will be implemented. The reports are what the commissioners will implement and any one that does not work as expected will be removed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:17:45.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
