There are new shots of both the Red Ranger and Black Ranger in their Zords as they attempt to stop Goldar's destructive path. There's also a few extra pieces of voice over dialogue courtesy of Bryan Cranston's Zordon, mainly in regards to Rita Repulsa, who gets a bit of the spotlight in this action packed spot. \nThe biggest hit of nostalgia, however, comes from the remixed version of the Rangers theme song. While the beat's received an upgrade, the melody and lyrics are unchanged, and it's fantastic to see the stunning Zords battle it out to \"Go Go Power Rangers\". \nYou can view the full TV spot above, and the official synopsis for Power Rangers is listed below. \n\"Saban’s Power Rangers follows five ordinary high school kids who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove – and the world – is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover that they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so they will have to overcome their real-life issues and band together as the Power Rangers before it is too late.\" \nPower Rangers stars Bryan Cranston (Zordon), Elizabeth Banks (Rita Repulsa), Naomi Scott (Kimberly/Pink Ranger), David Denman (Sam Scott), Becky G. (Trini/Yellow Ranger), Sarah Grey (Amanda), RJ Cyler (Billy Cranston/Blue Ranger), Emily Maddison (Rebecca), Ludi Lin (Zack Taylor/Black Ranger), and Dacre Montgomery (Jason Lee Scott/Red Ranger). \nPower Rangers is set to land in theaters on March 24, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:42:08.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
