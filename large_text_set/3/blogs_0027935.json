please send this feedback to your boss,\" said one user. \"What a low-standard name,\" said another.\nWeibo users are also saying that the Aibiying sounded a lot like a company selling sex toys, because \"bi\" is a homonym for a crude slang term for vagina, and \"ying\" sounds like the Chinese word for lust.\nImage: Ng Yi Shu/Mashable\nChenXiaoBei says: \"From its logo and name, Aibiying just sounds like it's competing against [condom giant] Durex.\"\nImage: Ng Yi Shu/Mashable\nifeellikeCY: \"I'm embarrassed to even put the Airbnb app with the others;

Google was criticised when it unveiled its Chinese name (谷歌, pronounced gu-ge) in 2006; while a search for Snapchat's Chinese name (色拉布, pronounced se-la-bu) on Baidu turns up pictures of labradors .\nBing, the search engine run by Microsoft, still uses its original English domain name in the country, which sounds like the Chinese word for \"sick\" (bing, or 病).\nWATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/rgQB8NjD.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/rgQB8NjD.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dR02bjP-Slnw9KXeQU67bE0FDwY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423705%2F33f3b63d-c078-4aee-9114-bb52250aa559.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aesOT_EYXG_YExrIIdU93w57YMY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423715%2Faa60e312-e86d-4431-bd77-d88e0161afb6.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5Z5oJJZs-Z0sBuHohPFF2BcWEPQ=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423715%2Faa60e312-e86d-4431-bd77-d88e0161afb6.png", "http://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1645503", "http://image.baidu.com/search/index?tn=baiduimage&ps=1&ct=201326592&lm=-1&cl=2&nc=1&ie=utf-8&word=%E8%89%B2%E6%8B%89%E5%B8%83", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/w5eMQD0QvrGwD2-PhzpJg6eySUA=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423700%2F91830d5d-2da5-4bee-a3de-a47e8ffb2b3c.png", "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2006-04/21/content_573226.htm", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LxA9070SVLoTv-D2xS38uhdeTaU=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423705%2F33f3b63d-c078-4aee-9114-bb52250aa559.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/323dSjjWJnI807RMR2P_KpyjzP4=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423700%2F91830d5d-2da5-4bee-a3de-a47e8ffb2b3c.png", "http://www.chinalawblog.com/2016/07/china-trademarks-whats-your-chinese-company-name.html"], "published": "2017-03-23T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T10:04:47.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
