The couple from Utah never had a chance.\nThe impact sent Kurt, a 54-year-old musician, plunging to his death onto a stone landing below the walkway. Melissa, 46, was left splayed out on the roadway , with a broken leg and rib and blood covering her face next to a toppled postcard kiosk.\nKurt was among three fatal victims of Masood’s death drive toward Britain’s Parliament building.

So cool!” Kurt wrote in one of several Facebook dispatches.\nFriends and family said Kurt and Melissa, who built their own recording-studio business from the ground up, were a perfect match.\n“I think that’s the tragic part of it is that him and his wife — you know those marriages that you see and you’re like, ‘Man I want that one day,’ that’s it you know, and they had one of those marriages,” pal Karlie Matthews, of Salt Lake City, told the BBC. “They loved each other and valued each other so much, and my heart just breaks for her, and yeah, it’s rough.”\nMelissa treated Kurt’s children from a previous relationship — Tyler, 31, and Dallas, 26 — as if they were her own, relatives said.\n“I couldn’t have asked for a better stepmother to my boys — she basically was a second mother to them,” Kurt’s former partner, Danielle Wiley, told The Post. “I pray for a quick and speedy recovery for Melissa, and my heart goes out to Kurt’s remaining family.”\nPresident Trump called Kurt “a great American” in a Thursday tweet , adding. “My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends.”\n\nReuters\n\nReuters\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nReuters\nAd Up Next \nReeling Devils have no answers for Maple Leafs' young gun 0:0 TORONTO — Auston Matthews had two assists and William Nylander... 10 View Slideshow\nBack Continue Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Advertisement The tragic tale of the Utah man killed in British Parliament attack March 23, 2017 Three other victims died in the terror attack, including Police Contable and father Keith Palmer, and Aysha Frade, who was on her way to pick up her two young daughters when Masood came speeding along the bridge.\nAn unidentified 75-year-old man died on Thursday after being taken off life support , police said.\nFrade, 43, a British woman, worked nearby at DLD College London, where she taught Spanish.\n“We are all deeply shocked and saddened at the news that one of the victims yesterday was a member of our staff, Aysha Frade,” said her boss, Rachel Borland.\n“She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues.
