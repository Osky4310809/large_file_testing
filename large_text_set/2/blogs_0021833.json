Honey, Marvin’s current wife, felt the sting of her insults as Sarah immediately called her a hussy when she dropped her daughter Nicole off at the house. Sarah went on to hit the local garage sales, and Jessica noticed her bargaining power involved fake crying to get the price down. “I think about the bargains I missed in the past to get me in the right headspace and then, to get the tears flowing, I think about all the kittens that died during the filming of Milo and Otis ,” explains Sarah. Not realizing Sarah was Honey’s enemy, Jessica brought these two together for a gal’s night out. Things got uncomfortable when they were locked in the bar and forced to listen to Sarah McLachlan songs. But even Sarah McLachlan couldn’t bring these two together, and the insults just kept on coming. Jessica, feeling the need to help Honey, decided the best thing to do was to get Sarah fired from her glove-selling job. Quickly realizing the error of her ways, Jessica got Sarah her job back, and Honey and Sarah realized their rivalry wasn’t about Marvin, it was about Nicole, and they were able to put aside their differences.
