The resistance from residents near each site is straining the new Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission rules requiring companies to look hard at alternatives and collaborate more when drilling near homes. \n“Nothing in that whole fight did anything to protect me. The COGCC rulemaking provided a blueprint for how to put large oil and gas facilities in neighborhoods. But we were expecting them to say where these things should go,” said Jacky Kowalsky, 54, who formed a group to challenge drilling in her neighborhood near Thornton in unincorporated Adams County. “Oil and gas facilities do not belong in neighborhoods. They are industrial facilities. And it is like the companies are taking over our zoning. If oil and gas comes, it turns it into an industrial area. Should I live in an industrial area? Is that good for my health and safety? It is not good for property values. It is not good for road safety.” \nIndustry officials say they’re doing all they can to allay resident concerns and still drill for oil and gas — for which they have legal rights under Colorado’s split estate system that allows separate ownership interests in surface and underground property. \n“There are some people who will always be opposed to any form of fossil fuel development no matter what,” Extraction spokesman Brian Cain said. “For those people who are in the middle, they’re doing the right thing by asking questions of operators who come into their communities.” \n“We don’t get to choose where the minerals are located,” Cain said. “Wherever we operate, we do everything we can to go above, and even beyond, the regulatory requirements, to consult with communities, to do everything possible to minimize impacts.” \nA broader legal struggle continues, too, with the Colorado Court of Appeals hearing arguments Tuesday challenging state officials’ mandate to ensure responsible production of oil and gas. The judges, handling a case brought by teenagers concerned about enabling climate change, must decide the extent to which extraction must be consistent with protecting the environment and public health. \nThe Colorado Supreme Court last year ruled state interests in oil and gas development trump local government bans, though the ruling doesn’t block moratoriums “materially shorter” than five years. Colorado’s attorney general last week sued Boulder County over a drilling moratorium similar to those struck down in Fort Collins and Longmont. \nThe packed public forum put people in from of presenters from Extraction, the COGCC and the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment. Neighborhood representatives voiced views aimed at informing Broomfield leaders ahead of a scheduled Feb. 28 vote on the drilling moratorium. \n“It’s a matter of health and safety. Oil and gas has a right to drill. But this is actually going to be a massive industrial complex,” said Ann Byers, representing the Wildgrass neighborhood in northeast Broomfield, within 2,500 feet of a site where Extraction plans exploratory drilling in 2018. \n“We want to make sure this is the best place for the project. There’s been no alternative site analysis we know of,” she said. “I’m a realist, a pragmatist. It is probably going to happen. The best thing we can do is work to make sure it is as safe as it can be. We are not even anti-oil and gas. But Colorado should actually enforce the rules as written.” \nThe state officials at the forum made presentations about rules and regulations, as they’ve done repeatedly around Colorado during the post-911 push for increased domestic oil and gas production using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. \nYet residents remain skeptical. \nAlong the Colorado River at Battlement Mesa, residents recently helped compel Ursa officials to withdraw a plan to drill a waste disposal injection well near a municipal water supply intake system. State health officials have opposed drilling waste wells in neighborhoods. \nSome residents are opposing projects where companies have yet to seek COGCC permits, such as a plan by Conoco-Phillips to drill 80 wells and install 32 storage tanks east of Denver and south of Interstate 70 in Arapahoe County. \n“They should drill in an appropriate place, not near where people live,” said Becky Roberts, a retired school teacher representing Watkins Farm homeowners in that area. “We’re asking county officials for a public hearing. They’re saying they are not required to give us one.” \nCDPHE information about potential respiratory problems associated with exposure to drilling emissions suggest greater distances are safer, Roberts said. “If this was over a half mile away, I would not have the objections I have now.” \nResidents in Greeley, where hundreds of wells already have been drilled inside city limits, are fighting an Extraction project near the Triple Creek neighborhood. \n“Extraction Oil and Gas did not do a robust, thorough alternative site analysis as they are required to do,” said retired U.S. Forest Service employee Lowell Lewis, 69. “We have played by the rules. We are stuck. We’re going to have a large industrial facility just beyond our backyards. … And just because I am bitter about what has happened to us doesn’t mean I don’t realize we are still chained to fossil fuels.” \nExtraction officials said Tuesday they will use a pipeline to remove oil and gas and reduce truck traffic in the Triple Creek neighborhood. \n“The scale of the new sites that are preferred is unlike anything we’ve seen in the past, with up to 40 wells on a pad,” said Matt Sura, a Longmont attorney who has represented residents and local governments statewide in their dealings with companies and regulators for more than a decade. “And Colorado’s task force recommendations do not seem to be working. There are concerned neighbors from Greeley to Garfield County who are not being heard. You’re going to see more communities rising up to make sure they are protecting their neighborhoods.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:10:14.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
