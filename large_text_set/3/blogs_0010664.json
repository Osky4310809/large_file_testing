Manchester City’s manager does not care much for consensus, compromise or pragmatism and his barely contained post-match excitement at Middlesbrough reflected the Catalan’s belief that his philosophy is, once again, being vindicated. Manchester City and David Silva catch Middlesbrough cold to reach semi Read more \nSaturday’s 2-0 FA Cup quarter-final win on Teesside was all about confounding Aitor Karanka’s players courtesy of complex, invariably high-speed, geometrical passing patterns often initiated by Claudio Bravo as City played, consistently, from the back. With a little more luck and accuracy and without the excellence of Boro’s goalkeeper, Brad Guzan, Guardiola’s team could conceivably have won by seven or eight goals on a day when the mercurical movement of Leroy Sané, Yaya Touré, David Silva and Sergio Agüero ruthlessly exposed their opponents’ limitations. \nIt was City’s 11th straight game undefeated, their third straight clean sheet, and it provided a perfect limber-up for the defence of the 5-3 lead they take into Wednesday’s second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie in Monaco. \n“I was so, so, happy at Barcelona and at Bayern Munich and I’m sure I’ll be so happy here,” enthused Guardiola. “I love to work with these guys. They try to follow what we try to teach them and that’s the reason I enjoy it so much. When I feel the players don’t follow me, why should I be here? Not for one title, No. I am not here just for one.” \nIf the title seems Chelsea’s this season, the mastery of a belief system only temporarily disrupted by Middlesbrough’s sporadic attempts at a high press, allied to the signing of a new goalkeeper – Sunderland’s Jordan Pickford anyone? – suggests it could yet be City’s next term. \n“When you attack good, you defend good,” said Guardiola, who, typically, turned a blind eye to an awful first-half fumble from Bravo. “We defend 40m away because I always believe that when the ball’s far from our goal, we’re safe. The reason we’re creating more goals and conceding fewer is the way we play.” \nAfter an at times underwhelming and occasionally downright sticky induction in England in which repeated manifestations of the City manager’s sulky, stubborn side highlighted the naivety of those football Europhiles who believed he would walk the league, revolutionising the English game along the way, a new dawn finally seems to be illuminating the skies over the Etihad. \n“Of course, teams can stop us,” he agreed, acknowledging that his dogma is not quite nirvana. “But if we had taken 50% of the chances we created this season, we’d be in a better position now. That’s been our problem.” \nHe is duly demanding greater incision in the two 18-yard areas where it really matters. “Football’s about boxes,” said City’s manager. “Before I was managing at two clubs where, in the boxes, they were top. You see Madrid, you see Barcelona, you see Juventus, you see their teams in the boxes and they do not make any mistakes. To achieve titles, that’s what we have to improve – especially next season. My feeling is the way we play is getting better day by day. I’m so, so, happy to be going to Wembley for the semi-final.” \nThe FA Cup may not be quite the trophy City’s owners had originally hoped to show off in Abu Dhabi this May but, right now, it would serve as confirmation that Guardiola’s ideology really can work in England.
