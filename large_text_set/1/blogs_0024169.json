For example, it confirmed that the physical home button is being ditched and the fingerprint scanner is being moved to the back. It also confirmed that the handset will have an amazing display-to-body ratio. \nSince that leaked picture was a bit blurry, this unofficial render of the Galaxy S8 is going to give you a better idea of what the Galaxy S8 might look like. This render is based on the current rumors and reports about the Galaxy S8 so it’s not the real deal but works well as a reference point. \nThe render shows us that the Galaxy S8 might have a dedicated hardware button for the Bixby artificial intelligence assistant , the edge-to-edge curved “Infinity” display and a fingerprint scanner on the back. What do you think about how the Galaxy S8 is shaping up to be so far? \nSamsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S8 on March 29 and release it by mid-April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T08:55:00.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
