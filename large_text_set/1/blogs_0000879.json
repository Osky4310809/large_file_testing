The 16-year-old former “America’s Got Talent” singer Jackie Evancho, the Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir are the only performers announced so far. Also Read: Mormon Tabernacle Choir Singer Quits Over Trump Inauguration: 'I Could Never Throw Roses to Hitler' \nBoth the Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir have received backlash for agreeing to attend the event. Multiple Rockettes have publicly opted to sit out of the performance, and a female member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir quit the group last week, comparing Trump to Hitler in her resignation letter. \nSeveral high-caliber performers have also publicly rejected requests to take part in the festivities, including Celine Dion, Garth Brooks, Elton John and operatic singer Andrea Bocelli. \nRead Ferguson’s full statement below: \nI’ve been asked and this is my answer. If you allow me to sing “strange fruit” a song that has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the United States for being too controversial. A song that speaks to all the disregarded and down trodden black people in the United States. A song that is a reminder of how love is the only thing that will conquer all the hatred in this world, then I will graciously accept your invitation and see you in Washington.
