We think we can improve the future lives of disadvantaged children,\" Hornby said. \nNovelists such as Zadie Smith and Sophie Kinsella serve as patrons for the programme. \nThe writing centre, hidden behind the quirky Hoxton Street Monster Supplies shop, provides after-school writing activities to children in the neighborhood. \nMany of the students don't speak English at home and come from low-income backgrounds. \n\"They may have a grandparent in Nigeria or ... Colombia. They represent the rich tapestry of London life and they can draw on that,\" said Emma Joliffe, the centre's creative learning manager. \nThe idea has gained traction and now interest is pouring in from around the world from groups hoping to set up their own ministries of stories. \nFollow Jessica Baldwin on Twitter: @jessicambaldwin Source: Al Jazeera Tell us what you think Content on this website is for general information purposes only.
