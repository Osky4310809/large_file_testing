I haven’t thought about it,” Anthony told reporters, via ESPN . “I mean, there was an opportunity during the deadline, and there was always talk over the past couple seasons with me somehow being connected to the Clippers or Lakers. “At first it was the Lakers, and then now it’s the Clippers situation. So I try not to think about that, especially now when I’m still playing with the New York Knicks. I’ve got to go out there and prepare to play against these guys and other teams.” \nAnthony forced his way to the Knicks via trade from Denver in 2011, specifically because he wanted to live in New York City. He’s got one year left on his contract before he can become an unrestricted free agent, at which time places like L.A. will undoubtedly be more strongly considered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:50:51.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
