Can’t wait to see you grace that ballroom floor, break a leg! #DWTS,” Yamaguchi, 45, tweeted early Monday, just hours ahead of the show’s premiere.\nSo excited for you @NancyAKerrigan ! Can't wait to see you grace that ballroom floor, break a leg! #DWTS \n— Kristi Yamaguchi (@kristiyamaguchi) March 20, 2017 \nAlthough Yamaguchi, who won the Mirrorball Trophy on season 6 of DWTS , intended to send a heartfelt message to Kerrigan, her word choice caused for a cringe-worthy reaction from Twitter users.\nOver two decades ago, Kerrigan, 47, made headlines when she was attacked in January 1994 with a police baton at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Detroit a month before the Winter Olympics.\nFollowing a practice session, the figure skater was the victim of clubbing when Shane Stant took a police baton to her right knee in the hopes of breaking it and sidelining her from the Olympic games. He was hired by skating rival Tonya Harding ‘s ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and Harding’s bodyguard at the time.\nDirectly after the attack, Kerrigan was recorded saying, “Why, why, why?” and the incident became known as “ The Whack Heard ‘Round the World. ”\nShortly after Yamaguchi sent her well wishes in the tweet to Kerrigan, Twitter reacted with a flurry of gifs expressing both shock and surprise.\n@kristiyamaguchi @NancyAKerrigan pic.twitter.com/WbSZ0YHpaN \n— kylie sparks (@kyliesparks) March 22, 2017 \n. @kristiyamaguchi @NancyAKerrigan pic.twitter.com/YyFPZ8S9S2 \n— Abbi Crutchfield (@curlycomedy) March 22, 2017 \n@kristiyamaguchi @NancyAKerrigan pic.twitter.com/h8cfey7bEK \n— John Asante (@jkbasante) March 22, 2017 \n@kristiyamaguchi pic.twitter.com/eAVQlJtYur \n— Ξvan Ross Katz (@evanrosskatz) March 22, 2017 \n@kristiyamaguchi @NancyAKerrigan pic.twitter.com/JyjIUNSSk2 \n— Caryn Rose (@carynrose) March 22, 2017 \n@kristiyamaguchi @NancyAKerrigan pic.twitter.com/PxEAKx78nx \n— Barrett Tryon (@btreports) March 22, 2017 \n. @kristiyamaguchi @NancyAKerrigan pic.twitter.com/B7QeHKOb4w \n— Carmichael Dave (@CarmichaelDave) March 22, 2017 \n@kristiyamaguchi pic.twitter.com/jQVmXjQLoS \n— Mark Sundstrom (@106th) March 22, 2017 \n@kristiyamaguchi @NancyAKerrigan pic.twitter.com/CesClYwcDN \n— Kevin O'Keeffe (@kevinpokeeffe) March 22, 2017 \n. @kristiyamaguchi @NancyAKerrigan pic.twitter.com/yJHoeLgAND \n— -=CULLEN (@cullend) March 22, 2017 \n@kristiyamaguchi @NancyAKerrigan pic.twitter.com/icIN7NzIPD \n— JPS (@JasonPStarling) March 22, 2017 \nFROM COINAGE: The Cost of Dancing with the Stars ’ Mirrorball Trophy \nBut Kerrigan didn’t appear to take any offense to Yamaguchi’s tweet and thanked her for the encouragement: “Thank you so much Kristi!
