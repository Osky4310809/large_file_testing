Maybe the new government that has already shown its image internationally will use this against Iran to start new tension.\" \nThe U.S. and Israeli governments on Monday both accused Iran of test-firing the missile, with Israeli Prime Minister â€ŽBenjamin Netanyahu calling it a \"flagrant violation of a U.N. Security Council resolution\" and saying that \"Iranian aggression must not go unanswered.\" \nMeanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said he was \"aware that Iran fired that missile\" and that the Trump administration was \"looking into the exact nature of it.\" \nIran was one of seven Muslim-majority countries whose citizens were subject to travel restrictions imposed by the Trump administration.
