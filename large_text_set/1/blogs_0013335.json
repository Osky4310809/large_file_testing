In 2009, she started off as member of girl group 4Minute, which was a big success in South Korea. The following year HyunA launched her solo career with \"Change,\" but she would become more world renowned with follow-up \"Bubble Pop!\" Her notoriety grew with a cameo appearance in PSY's \"Gangnam Style\" video in 2012. Following 4Minute's disbandment last year, K-Pop's most provocative star is traveling the world and giving the U.S. a chance to experience her aptly-titled The Queen's Back Tour. Here's five songs that hopefully make the setlist. \n5. 4Minute's \" Crazy \" / Crazy (2015) \nHyunA was one-fifth of 4Minute with fellow members Jihyun, Gayoon, Jiyoon and Sohyun. The ladies' best comeback came with their sixth release, Crazy , and the brassy and sassy title track. Sax and booming beats backed them detailing their wildin' out ways. \"C-R-A-Z-Y,\" spelled HyunA on the club banger that truly lived up to its name. \n4. Trouble Maker's \" Now \" / Chemistry (2013) \nAside 4Minute and her solo activities, HyunA is a part of Trouble Maker with Beast's Hyunseung. The duo joined forces in 2011 and had the perfect Chemistry two years later on \"Now.\" The collaboration played like a KPop \"James Bond\" theme as HyunA and Hyunseung traded verses filled with melodrama and attitude. It was a cinematic stunner. \n3. \" Bubble Pop! \" / Bubble Pop! (2011) \n\"Bubble Pop!\" became HyunA's signature hit when it went viral with millions of views on YouTube (119 million views as press time). On her breakthrough, she sexed up K-Pop's cutesy sound with a flirty performance. Atop the stomping beat and hints of dubstep, HyunA took aim and fired off an effervescent effort that popped hearts around the world. \n2. \" Ice Cream \" / Melting (2012) \nHyunA followed up \"Bubble Pop!\" with an even more irresistible treat, 2012's \"Ice Cream.\" She took on her female heartthrob status, likening her loving to the beloved frozen dessert. \"I'll melt you down like ice cream,\" she promised atop the exotic hip-hop beats and synths. Flexing her bad girl side, the slinky \"Ice Cream\" was an easy sell in HyunA's hands. \n1. \"Red\" / A Talk (2014) \nWith 2014's \"Red,\" HyunA owned the throne and asserted herself as K-Pop's queen on the bananas banger. Twerk-tastic trap beats and grimy electronica soundtracked her ode to the lipstick that brought all the boys to the yard. HyunA's rap game was on-point as she dished out boastful lines with a fiery intensity. The A Talk single was a red hot release. \nTickets for HyunA's North American tour will be sold on Jan. 21. All the dates and locations are available below. It's official! Kpops sexiest star, Hyuna is coming to North America for a full tour!
