Fans are voting to see which Autobot, Decepticon or unknown evil gets the next Optimus-style upgrade.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nEvery Prime has to start somewhere. Optimus Prime was once Orion Pax, a lowly dock worker, archivist or possibly fry cook, depending on the Transformers continuity you follow. 80s kids got to witness the passing of the Matrix of Leadership from Optimus Prime to Hot Rod, who arose to become Rodimus Prime and light our darkest hour. \nNow Hasbro is letting the fans decide which bot gets the Matrix of Leadership and new look and name that come with it. The Power of the Primes fan vote is happening in two stages. First fans vote for the leaders of three different factions: honor, chaos and order. \nAdvertisement \n\nThe Honor group (Ultra Magnus, Arcee, Hound) wants to carry on Optimus Prime’s legacy. Chaos (Thunderwing, Optimus Primal and an Unknown Evil) are warlords bent on planetary domination. Order (Megatron, Shockwave and Star Saber) wish to leave Autobot and Decepticon distinctions behind and create a new world order. \n\nSo first fans pick a leader for the three factions, which will be revealed on January 27. Then they’ll vote for which of the three faction leaders gets the Matrix between February 1 through 4. The winner will be revealed later that month at the annual New York City Toy Fair. \nThe Chosen Prime (hee) will play a pivotal role in the upcoming Transformers Generations”Power of the Primes” storyline, the third part of the Prime Trilogy which began with Combiner Wars and continued with Titans Return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T16:26:01.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
