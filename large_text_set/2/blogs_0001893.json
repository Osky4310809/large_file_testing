Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice,\" said Trump. \"Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. Big impact.” \nHours later, Sean Spicer was asked what Trump meant by his comments about Douglass. He responded, \"I think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made.\" He continued, \"Through a lot of the actions and statements that he's going to make the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more.\" \nTrump also briefly spoke about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., generically saying that King's life is an \"incredible example\" that's \"unique in American history.\" He quickly went on to again complain about Time incorrectly reporting that a bust of King was removed from the White House (something the reporter has apologized for) and then went off on a tangent about CNN being \"fake news\" and Fox News treating him well. \nTrump was mocked on Twitter for his remarks, with users asking whether or not he knew Douglass, a freed slave turned abolitionist who died in 1875, was dead and if he could name one of Douglass' accomplishments. #TrumpBlackHistory also began trending with jokes, like the ones below. Hidden Fences was the first movie with an African American director to win the Oscar for best picture. #TrumpBlackHistory — Matthew A.
