I came on at half-time, but then just ran off the pitch and ended up in tears! \n\"To be honest to this day I have no idea why. I didn’t hate football. I loved kicking the ball around, but I suppose when I got into a proper match I didn’t know what to do and I panicked. The manager had to bring another lad off the bench!\" Henderson's first steps in football didn't quite go to plan...
