(Wade Tyler Millward/Las Vegas Review-Journal) By WADE TYLER MILLWARDLAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL \nThe Crate & Barrel under construction in the Downtown Summerlin shopping center is expected to finish before year’s end, sources say. \nAt this point, beams on the construction site show the project’s skeleton. It is located next to the Lazy Dog restaurant and furniture showroom Ethan Allen, on the center’s north side near West Charleston Boulevard and the 215 Beltway. \nThe home goods retailer announced its first Nevada location in March with no firm completion date. \nA special-inspection permit was issued to the site in December 2015 for work including grading, steel and concrete. \nSince then, several revision permits were granted for the site in 2016 and earlier this year. Those permits were issued on Feb. 1, Nov. 21 and Dec. 19, with another revision permit granted Jan. 9, 2017, according to county records. \nIt was not clear if all the revision permits were for the Crate & Barrel project specifically or another project at the same site. \nBoth Crate & Barrel and Downtown Summerlin declined to comment. \nContact Wade Tyler Millward at 702-383-4602 or .
