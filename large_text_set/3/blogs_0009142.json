In an interview with Mid-Day , Oberoi said, \"When I met her, I got to know that she is looking for a job. Since I found her talented, I offered her one in my company. Also, when I learnt that she stays in a rented apartment, as a responsible citizen, I decided to gift her a home through my affordable housing company.\" \nNot only this, he has also arranged counselling sessions for her, to help her cope with the trauma that the attack has caused. \nNot only is this a wonderful way to honour women, it is a source of hope when someone with power and fame extends help to those in need.
