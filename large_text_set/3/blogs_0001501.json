I was taking pics and texting the pics to [the college presidents],” Conway told the Daily Caller. “MANY of them have defended me on radio and social media.” \nRichmond never apologized for his comments, which he labeled a “joke.” The fact that he never apologized, or retracted his comments, didn’t get past Conway. \n“I notice he did not apologize, he tried to clarify,” she noted in comments to the Daily Caller. \nNot getting the same affection that many liberal women get in politics and the media is nothing new to Conway. In fact, last year she became the first women to successfully lead a winning presidential campaign , yet the accomplishment was almost never talked about in the media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T21:32:17.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
