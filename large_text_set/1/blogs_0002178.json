Leaked presentation slide reveals HMD Global will launch up to 7 Nokia Android phones this year By January 4, 2017 “The new Nokia-branded phones will cover entry, mid and high-end segments” \nLast week, a report from Taiwan had suggested that HMD Global, the new home for Nokia devices, would launch five Nokia-branded smartphones this year. Now a leaked slide from a Malaysian distributor’s presentation suggests that HMD will launch as many as six to seven Nokia Android smartphones this year. \nThe slide mentions that HMD will continue to launch a series of attractive Nokia feature phones and maintain the market share. In addition, it will release six to seven Nokia Android phones this year, which will cater all major price categories – low-end, mid-range, and high-end. Reports indicate that the Nokia D1 and Nokia E1 may be the first ever Android smartphones from HMD. \nLast month, a couple of live images and sketches of the Nokia D1 and Nokia E1 hit the interwebs. They are expected to be mid-range smartphones set for an unveiling at MWC in March, with prices starting at around Rs 10,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T14:20:57.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
