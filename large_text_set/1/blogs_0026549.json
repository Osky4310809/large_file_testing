Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, are expressing their skepticism over DeVos. They say they are not yet sure whether they will vote for her on the Senate floor.\nMurkowski says DeVos has yet to prove that she deeply cares about America’s struggling schools and its children. Murkowski says the nominee has not yet earned her full support.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T20:10:52.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
