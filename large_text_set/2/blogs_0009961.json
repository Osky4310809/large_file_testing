Because of this, Leah has had to endure two bone marrow transplants. But the Oakland, California girl is making the best out of a terrible situation — through music. \nIn a Facebook video , the little survivor is seen singing and dancing (with impressive choreography, I might add) to Mandisa’s “Overcomer.” \nThe video was posted by Leah’s mom, Lindsay Chapman-Carroll, and has since gone viral with over 33 million views. Describing the song as one of Leah’s “all time favs,” Capman-Carroll decided to share the video with Mandisa, writing, “ She is such a light to all she meets … I hope she brings a smile to your face, too!” \nThe comment was actually seen by the Christian singer, who shared the video, commenting, “Leah: You are an overcomer in the truest sense of the word!” \nLeah is a beautiful example of perseverance in the face of adversity. Here’s hoping she spreads her goodness and inspires others to overcome their own obstacles. \nIf you’d like to support Leah and her family, visit their GoFundMe page .
