Sanders was charged Feb. 18, 2017, in the fatal shooting of Keith Armstrong on Dec. 22, 2016. \nST. LOUIS • A St. Louis man was charged over the weekend in a deadly robbery attempt in December after ballistic tests on a gun matched shell casings found at the crime scene, police say. \nDion T. Sanders, 23, of the 1000 block of North 11th Street, was charged Saturday with first-degree murder, assault, robbery and three counts of armed criminal action in the Dec. 22 killing of Keith Armstrong and the wounding of another man. \nSanders approached Armstrong, 56, and another man, 65, who were on a front porch shortly before 10 p.m. in the 2000 block of Destrehan Street in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood, charges say. Sanders announced a hold-up, and after a struggle, shot Armstrong in the chest and the other man in the hand. \nArmstrong ran, and the other man retreated into the house and was shot at least twice more in the arm and leg, police say. Armstrong was found by police dogs about an hour later in a rear yard in the 2000 block of Agnes Street, which runs parallel to Destrehan and is a block to the south. Armstrong had lived of the 1000 block of Preservation Place. \nThe wounded shooting victim survived and later identified Sanders as the shooter after Sanders' Feb. 14 arrest for resisting arrest, charges say. While arresting Sanders, police say they found in the back seat of a car a 9mm handgun. Police tested the gun and found a match to bullet casings found at the shooting scene on Destrehan. \nThe surviving shooting victim also identified Sanders in an array of photos, charges say. Sanders' criminal history includes 2012 convictions of burglary, stealing and a 2015 arrest for unlawful use of a weapon. \nBail for Sanders was set at $500,000 cash-only. \nDion T. Sanders was charged Feb. 18, 2017, in the fatal shooting of Keith Armstrong on Dec. 22, 2016.
