AP \nMANILA, Philippines – Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. said he has to find a new posting for the country’s ambassador to the United Kingdom as a form of courtesy to the career diplomat, whose replacement was named after President Duterte assumed office. \nFormer president Benigno Aquino III appointed Evan Garcia as ambassador to the UK. After the Commission of Appointments (CA) confirmed Garcia’s appointment and after he received the agreement from UK, Garcia was posted to London last April even though he had not yet presented his credentials to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. \nAfter assuming office, Duterte appointed a new ambassador to the UK, Antonio Lagdameo who was ambassador to Spain and the UK during the Arroyo administration. \nBut Lagdameo still had to go through the confirmation process of the CA and to receive the agreement from UK before he could replace Garcia. \n“As a result, it was suggested by the UK ambassador to the Philippines that Ambassador Garcia obtain a new appointment from President Duterte before presenting his credentials to Her Majesty The Queen,” Yasay explained in a Facebook post. \nBut Yasay said he objected and suggested instead that Garcia should proceed with presenting his credentials to the Queen, while Lagdameo was still undergoing the confirmation process and could not yet assume the post.
