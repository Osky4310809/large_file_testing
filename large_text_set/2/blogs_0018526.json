The idea is to get all European citizens to realise that oceans are changing because of our activities and that this is having an affect on our health and food supply, as well as climate. \nConsidering how long it has taken to convince people that climate change is real it is a big ambition to get the same level of understanding about oceans. \nTo those Europeans living closest to the Atlantic the most obvious effect of the ocean is the Gulf Stream keeping our west coast 5C warmer in the winter than it would otherwise be. If you live in Newcastle, where a cold current comes from the north, you will know about the more local effect of warm air over cold water that gives the coast the sea fret that can, at any season, keep the sun blocked out for days. Deep sea creatures 'will not escape climate change' Read more \nHowever, the first fact that the EU-backed Sea Change campaign offers is a stunner – that half the oxygen we breathe comes from the oceans – and if the plankton that produces it died off so would we. \nBut like all environmental campaigns, aimed at getting us to change our ways, the trick is not to be too depressing. So prizes are being offered to anyone coming up with a fun video less than two minutes long which outlines a plan “to increase people’s awareness and appreciation of the ocean.” The winning idea will get financial backing and promotion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:09:11.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
