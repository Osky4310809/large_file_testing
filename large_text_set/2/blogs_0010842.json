News Group Newspapers Ltd Moussa Dembele is wanted by a number of Premier League giants \nGet ahead of the game and learn the TOP TEN hottest whispers right now … 1. Moussa Dembele – Celtic to Arsenal – 3.8 \nWhether Arsene Wenger quits in the summer or not, Arsenal will likely continue their love affair with young, pacy Frenchmen long into the future – and Moussa Dembele certainly fits the bill. \nChelsea were rumoured to be weighing up a £40million deal for the 20-year-old , but Arsenal are now thought to be leading the race for a man who has scored hat-tricks in successive games for Celtic. Moussa Dembele shows Chelsea what they’re missing after firing deadly 24-minute hat-trick against St Johnstone Football Whispers' top ten rated deals to happen this summer 2. Ashley Young – Manchester United to Shandong Luneng – 3.7 \nA rumour that has persisted for a while now, but all signs point to Ashley Young ’s exit from Manchester United in the summer and a possible money-spinning deal in China. \nThe former England winger has featured just twice for United since December 14 and though Jose Mourinho was reluctant to let him go in January, the writing is surely on the wall. Getty Images Ashley Young has been offered mega money to move to China 3. Fabinho – AS Monaco to Manchester United – 3.6 \nAccording to Fabinho’s Dad, Joao, every man and his dog are interested in the Monaco star but we like the chances of a transfer to United the best. \nHowever, Arsenal, Manchester City and even Barcelona could still pip Mourinho to Fabinho, who since being converted from a right-back last season has been a revelation in the Monaco midfield. Getty Images Monaco's Fabinho is on the radar of Jose Mourinho at Man Utd 4. Antoine Griezmann – Atletico Madrid to Manchester United – 3.5 \nThis whisper is not disappearing anytime soon, and the latest rumour is that Antoine Griezmann will still be willing to join United, and his good mate Paul Pogba, even if they miss out on the Champions League. \nAtleti president Enrique Cerezo has dismissed reports that the 25-year-old, who scored his 17th goal of the season on the weekend, will leave, but he has an £85million release clause just begging to be activated. Getty Images Antoine Griezmann is another target of Jose Mourinho's at Old Trafford 10 things you may not know about French striker and Manchester United target Antoine Griezmann 5. David De Gea – Manchester United to Real Madrid – 3.5 \nFew United fans will bat an eyelid if Young leaves – but many will be left wiping their eyes if Real Madrid sign star keeper David De Gea at the second attempt. \nA transfer only thwarted by a dodgy fax machine 18 months ago, the Spanish giants never rest until they get their man, but expect fierce resistance from Old Trafford. PA:Press Association But Man Utd could lose David de Gea if Real Madrid get their way Manchester United keeper David De Gea pull off a world class save against Watford Related stories PEP TALK Pep Guardiola makes heartwarming gesture to Harry Arter by wishing him well for upcoming birth of child PREVIEW PSG v Barcelona: What time does the match kick-off, what TV channel is it on, and what is the latest team news?

Inaki Williams – Athletic Bilbao to Liverpool – 3.3 \nAccording to some reports, Liverpool are willing to activate a release clause and shell out a whopping £42.5million for Athletic Bilbao forward Inaki Williams. \nThe 22-year-old has recently denied he is looking for a ‘change of scenery’ – but the prospect of playing at Anfield week in, week out could well help the one-cap Spain international reconsider. EPA Liverpool are likely to face competition from Dortmund for Inaki Williams 7. Leonardo Ulloa – Leicester City to Sunderland – 2.9 \nDespite throwing every one of his toys out of the pram in January – not to mention his agent – Leonardo Ulloa was forced to remain in the East Midlands. \nSunderland reportedly made bids ranging from £3million to £11million for the Argentinean last month, but a move in the summer is dependent on whether either, or both clubs, can beat the drop. PA:Press Association Argentina hitman Leonardo Ulloa wants out of Leicester 8. Ghayas Zahid – Valerenga to Manchester City – 2.9 \nThis rumour came from the horse’s mouth as Norwegian youngster Ghayas Zahid claimed he was close to leaving Valerenga for Manchester City during the January transfer window. \nIf he does make his mooted switch in the summer, however, expect him to gain experience at sister clubs Melbourne City or New York City, rather than take the Etihad by storm next year. Getty Images Ghayas Zahid (far right) could be on his way to Manchester City 9. Dele Alli – Tottenham Hotspur to Manchester City – 2.5 \nSorry, Ghayas – but this move would steal your thunder if it went through this summer. Rumours are gathering pace that City will pull out all the stops to extract Dele Alli from White Hart Lane. \nPep Guardiola has seen the boy wonder score twice against his team this season and he has apparently instructed the powers-that-be to make a world-record bid. Getty Images 11 Dele Alli could end up replacing Yaya Toure at Manchester City Dele Alli is on top form in this new adidas advert that just won't let you forget his name 10. Michael Keane – Burnley to Chelsea – 2.4 \nMichael Keane put in a mammoth performance to help stop Chelsea going 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League on Sunday. \nThat will only have reinforced Antonio Conte’s opinion of the Burnley defender, who started his career at Old Trafford, as he seeks a replacement for John Terry in the summer.
