They're here.\nApparently Shia LaBeouf had very (read: unreasonably) high hopes for the integrity of his latest piece of performance art , a 4-year-long livestream set up outside NYC's Museum of the Moving Image for people to chant \"he will not divide us\" to their heart's content. Initiated on Inauguration Day, the piece is meant to be a rallying point for anti-Trump protesters.\nSEE ALSO: It's time to form your own pussy posse\nNaturally, as all things do when the internet is involved, it's not going as planned.\nMembers of the 4Chan thread /pol/ first rallied together virtually, then IRL, to sabotage the message of the project. Trolls have been visiting the site of the stream and sneaking in messages of the alt-right, white supremacy, and Pepe the frog , a meme somehow associated with both of those things.\nMr. LaBeouf shouting down a white supremacist earlier. This thing has been a fascinating watch so far. #HeWillNotDivideUs pic.twitter.com/i0J6oq3BLt\nâ€” murta (@murtaman) January 22, 2017\nShia can be seen getting in a counter-protester's face, shouting \"he will not divide us\" in retaliation. There have been dozens of counter-protesters visiting the site of the livestream since it began.\nPresumably they're getting the attention they wanted as Shia's notoriously short fuse continues to go off in a very public way. But at least he's trying to defend us against these white nationalist trolls.\nBONUS: Castle 3-D printed in concrete spells new era in architecture", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/5Jom6Qqk.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/5Jom6Qqk.jpg", "https://twitter.com/murtaman/status/823288723760672770", "https://t.co/i0J6oq3BLt", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/HeWillNotDivideUs?src=hash", "http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-the-frog"], "published": "2017-01-24T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:15:03.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
