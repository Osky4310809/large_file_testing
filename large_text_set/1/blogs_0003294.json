Your function is to provide a good solid rhythm for the fiddler,” even if they sometimes stumble, he said. \nWhile he knows most of the breakdowns and tunes of choice that are performed, some fiddlers perform a waltz they have written themselves. “Some of those can be tricky,” Mature said. \nMature and McKenzie play with anyone who wants their help, and generally sit in with about three-quarters of the contestants. \nThey often do a practice run with the fiddlers they will back up at a warm-up area near the stage at the Beef Palace Auction Arena, on the stock show grounds, where the contest is held. \nSome competitors bring their own guitar player, sometimes a family member. Sisters Mackenzie and Elyssa Johnston are both competing in the contest, and McKenzie, 16, will also play back-up guitar for Elyssa, 11, when the younger girl performs. \nBoth Mature and McKenzie have been playing stringed instruments for most of their lives. “I grew up around fiddle players,” Mature said. “My brother plays fiddle, and my dad plays guitar. I have several cousins who play, so every time there was a family function I would bring a guitar.” \nHe began playing as an accompanist at fiddle contests when he was 16, and since then has backed up fiddlers at competitions throughout the country, including the National Oldtime Fiddlers’ Contest and Festival in Weiser, Idaho. “You show up, and someone asks you to get your guitar out, and it kind of rolls from there.” \nMature, who worked as an accountant for the state of Texas, retired from that job recently, and traveled to France to back up Texas Oldtime fiddle champion Wes Westmoreland, whose musical accomplishments include a 10-year stint playing fiddle in country songwriter and singer Mel Tillis’ band. \nOregon native McKenzie has lived in Texas for 30 years. He has shared the stage with country stars Marty Stuart, Ricky Skaggs and Merle Haggard, and has backed up numerous fiddlers, including award-winning bluegrass player Michael Cleveland. \nHe now plays guitar, and sings, with the Western Fliers , a Texas-based trio that features champion fiddler and Boulder resident Katie Glassman and bass player Gavin Kelso. \nMcKenzie began playing guitar when he was a boy, but moved to fiddle after becoming friends with and playing back-up guitar for Texas fiddle legend Benny Thomasson. \nHe is a three-time world champion fiddler who has won more than 100 fiddle contests. \nA problem with his left hand and thumb made it difficult for him to play fiddle, and he switched to guitar in the late ’90s. However, “when a jam session breaks out, there is a high possibility that I am going to bust out the fiddle.” Tags: Tom McGhee A general assignment reporter for The Denver Post, Tom McGhee has covered business, police, courts, higher education and breaking news.
