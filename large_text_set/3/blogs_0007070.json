On January 1, we had a company dinner and I drank alcohol for the first time.” \nYerin added, “SinB and Umji were in high school for about two years while we were promoting, and everyday we would see each other in the morning and at the end of the day. Seeing my friends grow up like that, my tears welled up.” \nThe hosts joked, “Are you their mom?” Yerin laughed and continued, “In the morning, Umji wore her uniform in the agency and I got choked up thinking it was the last time [she would wear it]. I congratulated her while crying,” revealing her fondness for her members. \nGFRIEND also performed songs from their fourth mini album “Awakening” on the show, including their title track “Fingertip” .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T07:19:35.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
