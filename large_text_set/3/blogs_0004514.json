I asked him some questions about the coffee business, specifically where he thought the best coffee in the world was coming from right now.\n\"In my mind, the best coffee is generally from Ethiopia, where coffee began,\" Toscano told me. \"There, of course, are some absolutely mind-blowing coffees from Latin America and other countries in Africa, but in my experience, Ethiopia's climate and coffee-growing culture are consistently bringing to market products that have an amazing natural flavor to them. Lightly roasted Ethiopian coffees are generally more tea-like and sweet, with notes of berries and other fruit that just sing through the cup.\"\nBelow I've collected some coffee options from Ethiopia that you can buy online. If youâ€™ve been looking for a new bean to grind for your morning cup of Joe, consider giving one of these a try.\n Dark Roast Arabica Coffee from Koffee Kult Amazon This Arabica dark roast from Kult Koffee has over 1,100 reviews on Amazon and an average rating of 4.5/5 stars, which is quite the vote of confidence from your coffee-drinking breathren.\nKoffee Kult Dark Roast Coffee Beans (1 lb.), $18.99, available at Amazon\nEthiopia Yirge Cheffe from Brooklyn Roasting Company Mouth According to MOUTH, this Ethiopian Yirge Cheffe is bright and clean, with a light flavor of lemon rind.
