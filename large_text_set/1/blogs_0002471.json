Keith Ellison is hoping his background as the only candidate who supported both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will convince members of the Democratic National Committee that he's best positioned to unite the party as its next chairman. \nIn his race against Labor Secretary Tom Perez, a Clinton ally, Ellison could have positioned himself as either a bridge builder looking to mend the party or a radical reformer promising to tear down the DNC -- the target of so much ire from Sanders supporters -- and build it back up again in their image. \nEllison chose the former, hoping to reassure skittish Democratic insiders who are worried about a Sanders takeover of their party. \"Unity is the key,\" he said recently on Twitter. And Clinton allies have taken notice. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota, speaks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July. Bloomberg / Bloomberg via Getty Images \nLongtime Clinton aide Neera Tanden, who runs the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, worked with Ellison to help draft the Democratic Party's platform in meetings where she represented Clinton and he Sanders. \n\"I saw him as a very constructive voice in the platform process. And it was very apparent he was working hard to unite the party,\" said Tanden, who is staying neutral in the DNC Chair race and not endorsing any candidate. \nThe platform drafting process occurred during the tense late stages of the primary, before Sanders officially dropped out of the race and while many of his supporters, resentful about the DNC's handling of nominating contest, urged their candidate to keep up the fight. \n\"There were definitely Bernie delegates who were more negative,\" said Tanden. \"He was working throughout that process to bridge divides between Sanders voters and Clinton.\" \nThe platform drafting process occasionally erupted in turmoil over the Israeli-Palestinian issue, trade policy, fracking, and other matters, with Sanders supporters in the audience staging walkouts and disruptive protests during a two-day meeting in Orlando, Florida.
