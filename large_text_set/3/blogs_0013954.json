Last week, memories of the incident were put on full display when the album art for his posthumous release, No Life After Death, was shared by his manager Frank White on Instagram. \nThe cover sparked controversy due to a photo used of the eye-patch-donning rapper laying in a casket during his funeral. Dariauna Dior, the mother of Doe B’s child, called out White and made this comment on Facebook. \nT.I. , who signed Doe B to his Hustle Gang Records label, wasn’t a fan of the cover either. \nOne person who seemed to appreciate the cover was Doe B’s mother, Shirley Thomas. \nSpeaking in a video with White, the mother of the late rapper explained her acceptance of the bold cover art. \n“I approved it,” Thomas said. “When Frank came to me and questioned me about putting it on the album cover, I thought about it after I talked with him about it. But then when he put it out there and the response that we got from the fans: all the negativity and everybody coming after him, blaming him for it like he hadn’t talked to none of the family. I thought all that was wrong cause people need to get they information right before they start attacking this man. Cause this man been behind Doe B’s family [and] his children 100 percent.” \nWhite did eventually change the cover due to the negative response as the album getting closer to its June 13 release date. According to reports , proceeds from No Life After Death will go to Thomas and Doe B’s children. Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
