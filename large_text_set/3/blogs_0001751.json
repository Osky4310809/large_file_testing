Picture: Peter Clark \nThree residents gave evidence during the four-day hearing objecting the proposal, while four gave evidence in support. \nObjectors told the court the proposal was an “over development of the site”, would exacerbate parking problems and impacted the heritage significance of the theatre. \nHowever, Ms O’Neill found many of the so-called heritage elements of the building, first constructed in 1951, including the parapet, ventilation openings, its “art deco” style doors and the extended awning, timber stair and deck fronting Hunter Park were simply replacements or renovations of what was there originally. media_camera Beth and Norman Hunter have fought to redevelop their cinema since 2002. \n“I accept their agreement that the existing building does not demonstrate aesthetic characteristics worthy of the threshold for a local heritage listing,” she said. \nMs O’Neill further found while there was a shortfall of 33 parking spaces, they could be “accommodated in the public domain, within the vicinity of the proposal”. \n“There is sufficient parking available in the vicinity of the site to accommodate the demands of a 75 per cent maximum occupancy of the proposal at the peak Sunday summer times during the early afternoon,” she said. \nIn approving the development the court ordered the Hunters and the council to negotiate the appropriate opening hours for the cinema, cafe and terrace components within two weeks or return to court. \nComment is being sought from the Hunters. media_camera Norman Hunter, (second from left, rear) with officials from the Land and Environment Court during the recent assessment of the site and surrounds at Avoca Beach.
