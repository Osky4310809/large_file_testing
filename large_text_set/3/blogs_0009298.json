I think perhaps the newspapers have got this wrong.\n‘Were there concerns about the downloading of data that took place from that constituency? Yes. But beyond that we don’t know anything.\n‘We have evidence that Mr Carswell downloaded information. We have no evidence of what he did with it.’\nThe South Thanet seat was won by Tory Craig Mackinlay.\nAsked if he would stand in a by-election prompted by the investigation, Mr Farage replied: ‘I probably would.’\nMr Carswell said: ‘I am not commenting but I very strongly deny it.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T14:50:26.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
