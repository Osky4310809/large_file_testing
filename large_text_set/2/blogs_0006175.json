While supplies last, head on over to Chipotle.com where they are offering up a Reading Rewards Program geared for grades K-5 where students can earn FREE kid’s meals for daily reading !\nJust head on over here to submit your application (make sure “reading rewards” is selected) – note that a valid school or library email address is required.

Reward cards will be shipped directly to the school or district upon approval.\n\nNote that quantities are limited and only one application per school is allowed per year so be sure to share with all the teachers and staff so that your application represents the whole school.
