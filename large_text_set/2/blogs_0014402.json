Examples of STAR’s potential have already made the rounds online. In May of last year, STAR “ successfully operated on live soft tissue without human assistance ,” according to New Scientist , marking the first time a robot has been able to accomplish this feat. \nThe technology is aimed at decreasing complications, making surgeries safer and improving patients’ outcomes, Dr. Kim said. “At the same time, it democratizes the way we do a surgery so that anyone can have access to this technology in any place.” Even with the promising early returns from STAR, Kim has emphasized that the robots are meant to complement and not take over for human doctors. \n“The goal is not to simply take away or replace surgeons, but really enhance surgeons’ capacity and capability,” he said. He added: “In the future, tools will work with surgeons in saving lives.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:06:51.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
