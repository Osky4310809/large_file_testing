That’s because Volvo Car USA CEO Lex Kerssemakers recently revealed one eye-opening target for the project: a base price between $35,000 and $40,000. \n-Like the Model 3 and the Bolt, Volvo’s as yet unnamed electric model is expected to offer a range of 250 miles or more. Although there are a few automakers that think electric cars don’t need to go for maximum range— Honda, for instance —the consensus within the industry is that range sells.\n-Premium badges add appeal, too, and Volvo’s plan illustrates the different ways in which luxury brands plan to jump into the EV market. The Jaguar I-Pace , for instance, is expected to play in Tesla Model X territory, with a starting price well over $60,000. At $40,000, Volvo, on the other hand, would be offering a premium-badged electric vehicle for roughly the same price as some mainstream-brand models.\n-Volvo’s lowest-priced U.S. model at present is the S60 sedan , at $34,945, although the new EV plus the return of the smaller 40-series vehicles, anticipated to start arriving late next year, will give the automaker a smorgasbord of entries in the $30,000-to-$40,000 range.\n- \n-The EV is likely to share some elements with Volvo’s Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) platform, which will underpin its 40-series compact vehicles, but it will use its own set of modular electrification underpinnings. Last May, Volvo showed two electric-vehicle design concepts: the 40.1 crossover and the 40.2 sedan , previewing the design direction for the XC40 and the S40, respectively. At that time, Volvo said that there will be an electric vehicle based on the S40 or a unique vehicle derived from it.\n- - Swede Plan, Bro: Volvo Plans New Compact Crossover and Sedan, Luxe 90-Series Models - Volvo Details New Small-Car Platform, Electrification Plans - Instrumented Test: 2016 Volvo XC90 T8 Twin-Engine AWD Plug-In Hybrid - -In 2019, at around the same time the EV reaches the market, Volvo is also expected to introduce more hybrids to the product mix—including front-wheel-drive hybrid versions of its 40-series vehicles featuring an electric motor integrated with a dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Currently, the only Volvo hybrids—plug-in hybrids, actually—are the top all-wheel-drive T8 versions of the XC90, with a hybrid S90 coming soon.\n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:30:17.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
