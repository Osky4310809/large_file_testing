But she seems due for a major breakthrough this year, not least because every song the 22-year-old has put into the world — all three from the 7\" and now a new single called \"Smoke Signals\" — is consistently, strikingly beautiful. \nLike fellow rising stars Julien Baker (with whom she's toured) and Julia Jacklin , Bridgers immediately presents as a formidable talent: She's got a voice powerful enough to command any stage, but with intimate phrasing that cries out for late-night drives and walks under headphones. In \"Smoke Signals,\" she crams a relationship's worth of emotions, milestones and small details — a week in the wilderness, the deaths of Lemmy and Bowie , the scene surrounding a Holiday Inn — into five and a half slowly but powerfully unfurling minutes. YouTube \n\"Smoke Signals\" has also spawned a gloomy, vaguely unsettling video, which Bridgers describes as \"pretty much just a drawn-out version of a couple scenes from Carnival Of Souls , but instead of random dead dudes, it's all my friends. I paid them in pizza. We shot it at the Masonic Hall in Highland Park, which is the coolest place ever. I'm still bummed we didn't get a shot of the secret door in the wall that opens into this weird tiny room.\" Article continues after sponsorship", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T19:38:30.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
