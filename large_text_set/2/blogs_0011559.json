On Monday, Trump accepted Flynn’s resignation. In his resignation, heapologized for misleading the president and Vice President Mike Pence about the call in which he allegedly discussed sanctions levied against Moscow. \nYou have to have absolutely no knowledge of history to think that Trump should be impeached for what happened with Flynn. \nMoore either knows nothing about history or he’s pretending he doesn’t. \nEither way, it’s gross. \nYou can bet that Moore will throw the word “impeachment” around many more times before it’s all said and done.
