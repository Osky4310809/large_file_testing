Tweet Cherry blossom trees frame the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images) \nThe cherry blossoms have come alive in Washington, D.C., and these fresh blooms offer the perfect frame for some of the nation's most historic buildings — like the Jefferson Memorial above, seen beyond the cherry blossoms at sunrise. \nThe first trees were planted on the Tidal Basin by first lady Helen Taft and Japanese Viscountess Iwa Chinda in 1912, symbolizing friendship between the two countries. Thousands more cover the National Mall and Memorial Parks as a gift from Japan. \nThe blooms are lovely — but short-lived. Take a visual tour of this beautiful perspective of the nation's capital: \nThe Washington Monument.
