Thanks for your reaction Don’t forget to share this with your friends! ← Use Arrows Keys → 1 Emma Watson Just Revealed Her Entire Beauty Routine — Including an Oil For Her Pubic Hair \nEmma Watson is so much more than an accomplished actress and feminist role model . . . she's also an incredible source of beauty inspiration. For those who want to use exactly what she does, good news! She recently divulged her regimen in full to the writers behind Into the Gloss. \nIn case you were unaware of the star's support of sustainability and an eco-friendly lifestyle, you'll see it as soon you browse through her favorite products — they trend towards natural and organic formulas . \n\"I've become super interested in sustainability and transparency and understanding what I'm putting on my face and on my body,\" she explained. \"It's been a fun little mission to see how far I can go with it . . . Can I put together a hair and makeup look with completely organic products? I needed to figure out if it was achievable or not. You can't talk the talk if you don't walk the walk.\" \nEmma was refreshingly honest, disclosing everything from her slightly klutzy tendencies when it comes to using natural deodorant (\"I always end up getting it on my clothes\") to her struggle with bad skin as a teenager. And in case you weren't already obsessed with her, the star was also candid about the more private aspects of her routine. \n\"It's funny — I was just talking to my friend before this about how in the Instagram era it's so easy to edit your life so that it looks perfect,\" she said. \"But I bleach my top lip and tweeze my eyebrows and you'd never get to see that, even though it's a part of my routine. There's still so much shame around the things you do to get ready while you've got a towel wrapped around your head. It's important to me not to edit that out. I've been bleaching my top lip since I was 9. I don't do it very often, but I do it!\" \nFans were especially surprised that she chose to share that she uses Fur Oil ($39), a natural blend of oils that is designed to soften the skin and hair on the pubic area as well as prevent ingrown hairs. \"I'll use that anywhere from the ends of my hair to my eyebrows to my pubic hair,\" Emma noted. \"It's an amazing all-purpose product.\" \nRead on to shop some of our favorite products from Emma's regimen, then discover her beauty routine in full at Into the Gloss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:30:08.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
