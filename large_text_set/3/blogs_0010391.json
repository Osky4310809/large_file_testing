Smokin’ Betty’s BBQ + Bar is under construction at 94 Lafayette St. and will open this spring, according to the Salem Digest , putting Southern cuisine front and center. The restaurant is the work of Steve Feldmann and Marie Feldmannova, who also operate two other restaurants in Salem: Gulu-Gulu Cafe and Flying Saucer Pizza Company. They brought in Todd Bekesha to serve as executive chef at Smokin’ Betty’s. Bekesha is the architect of the North Shore’s Po’ Boys and Pies pop-up and will put his six years of experience cooking in New Orleans to use at this new barbecue place. The menu at Smokin’ Betty’s will feature smoked meats, along with some vegetarian options, and the restaurant is on track to get up and running this spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:13:09.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
