The Tesla and Space X CEO is so worried he wants to figure out a way to keep humans at the top of the proverbial food chain as we enter the age of AI.\nMusk just launched Neuralink Corp., which will work to merge the human brain with computers through \"neural lace\" technology, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal . The company will woro to develop technology that would essentially serve as a layer of AI inside the human brain.\nThis has been an ongoing theme for Musk; he even discussed his campaign to protect us all from becoming robot playthings in the not-so-distant future in a lengthy Vanity Fair profile.\nSEE ALSO: Elon Musk teases 'Model Y,' says it's coming in a few years\nIt's not exactly clear if Neuralink Corp. will score Musk a third CEO title — the WSJ report claims he \"may play a significant leadership role,\" but elaborates no further, and Musk didn't reply to requests for comment.\nThe news that Musk is launching a company to make neural lace a reality shouldn't come as a big surprise. He's discussed the technology before; he outlined the basic outline of the tech during a talk at the Code Conference last June . He said then the neural lace would \"effectively merge in a symbiotic way with a digital intelligence,\" giving humans an AI-powered connection without the need for conventional surgery.\nHe also said, \"If somebody doesn’t do it than I think I should do it.\"\nMusk is clearly finished waiting.\nWATCH: This ambitious U-shaped skyscraper could soon loop over NYC", "external_links": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/B7l87KlQ.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/B7l87KlQ.m3u8", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-launches-neuralink-to-connect-brains-with-computers-1490642652"], "published": "2017-03-28T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:38:47.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
