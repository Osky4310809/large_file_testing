I was a lifeguard at the local high school pools, and I've got to say — I had it pretty good. My primary duty was to sit there and watch the patrons, keeping a close eye on the ones who were weak swimmers. So that's what I was doing the majority of the time: sitting on a stool, turning my head back and forth. Occasionally, I'd get up and walk around.\nHowever, sometimes I had to do stuff I really, really didn't want to do. If a competitive swimmer puked after a long, hard race, the lifeguards had to clean it up. If a little kid took a sh*t in the pool, we had to fish it out (UGH). On our off shifts, we would scrub mold off the shower walls, spray down the locker room bathrooms (which could get pretty grimy), and wipe the cobwebs out of random corners of the facility. The worst duty, however, was making the place spotless after a swim meet. The pool deck, which was pretty sizable, would be littered with soggy PowerBars and popcorn and bagels and potato chips and whatever else the concession stand was selling that day. It was our job to step around the mess and clean it all up, using gloves, a big trash bin, and a hose.\nThe best lesson I learned at my first job was humility. Wiping down poop-stained pool toys taught me that no one person is better than another. And today, I'm all the more grateful that I entered a field I really love — my current job involves duties I enjoy carrying out. Every day, I get to write about career, travel, dating, books, and sex. Altogether, I feel pretty #blessed. (Most annoying hashtag in the world, but totally appropriate in this case.)\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media2.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/H_mvlAJVw56ax4ywYI0iRHXhdj4/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2015/08/20/893/n/1922398/f25061bc_POPSUGAR_03.26.15_ProductVignette_197_edit.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-27T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:15:10.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
