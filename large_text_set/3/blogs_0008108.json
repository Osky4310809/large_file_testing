For some, it is still too early to say, though somewhat less early than it was a few months ago, before UK Anti-Doping began its increasingly revelatory investigation into Team Sky and its partner British Cycling. \nBy now, there will perhaps be raised eyebrows in the many organisations before which the Team Sky head coach, Sir Dave Brailsford , spoke so lucratively as a management guru. If only they’d had access to whatever the corporate equivalent of a Therapeutic Use Exemption was. If only someone had sent them a metaphorical Jiffy bag. The NHS, on which Brailsford consulted via the cabinet secretary, might have had better luck with various performance targets if they’d been allowed not to keep selected medical records. \nThe irony is that the very outfit from which the little people were encouraged to learn could usefully have learned a lot from the little people. Richard Freeman, the former doctor who Team Sky seem to be rather hopefully hanging out to dry by saying he did not keep proper records of drugs he administered to riders . This week, a sometime colleague of his defended him to the BBC’s Dan Roan on the basis that “you get bombarded with stuff in elite sport”. Oh do look – I spy a potential marginal gain. Perhaps a run-ragged GP could come and give a motivational talk to Team Sky medics about finding the time to do so? \nIt is, as Spinal Tap once observed, such a fine line between stupid and clever, and any number of individuals connected with Team Sky and British Cycling are now on the wrong side of it. “Mistakes were made,” Brailsford concedes in the latest defensive no-brainer. Team Sky are a victim of their own furiously peddled self-image. Having sold themselves as an uber-professional outfit, their mistakes appear to be so amateur as to be mythos aborting. \nEven attempts to defend the maestro look excruciatingly orchestrated. Over a period of a couple of hours on Monday evening, more than half of Team Sky’s riders tweeted their support for Brailsford , with support measurements falling between a range of 100% and 110%. Whether the gesture was as spontaneous as it didn’t look is debatable – but the absence of a similar message from Sky figurehead Chris Froome overrode it all anyway. For both Britain and British cycling, the time has come to cash those cheques the ego has been writing \nIn some respects, Froome has long symbolised the weird mix of micromanagement and glaring lacunae that are coming to characterise Team Sky. Take his weight. Despite all the state-of-the-art technologies and measurements applied to him, Froome’s weight remained hamperingly high for some years. He himself says he was “aware of the weight issue”, but just didn’t think he could go any lower than 69 kilos. It was his fiancee (now wife) Michelle – a lay person with a what she described as “a bit of an interest in sports nutrition” – who masterminded the 20kg weight loss that was so significant in transforming him into a three-time Tour winner. \nThat story belongs in the homespun Rocky side of the training montage in Rocky IV. Yet we are always encouraged to think of the National Cycling Centre in Manchester (which Team Sky share with British Cycling) as more akin to the hi-tech Drago side – minus the syringes, of course. It is the so-called “medal factory”, to which the press has been frequently – and perhaps divertingly – invited over the past few years. \nJust before Christmas, as allegations intensified, the Financial Times was given a tour that seemed almost deliberately contrived to evoke that other hugely enjoyable archetype of British delusion, James Bond. We learned there was something literally called the “Secret Squirrel Club”, and a “Room X” where various hi-tech whatnots are developed and then given to riders just before they depart for a mission. I pictured Q snapping “pay attention, Double O Froome!” There was the unveiling of the latest wizardry – a “Readiness Index”. “This is not marginal gains. This is new. This is how we build a dynasty.” Nobody does it better, as Carly Simon was good enough to remind us. “We try to forecast and predict what it looks like in the future and work back from that in a timeline,” explained the “performance pathway manager”. It’s the old complaint, isn’t it? We can put a man on the moon but we can’t tell you where huge amounts of triamcinolone went. \nFor the past few years, meanwhile, we’ve seen countless hymns to what Brailsford and co always describe as “our culture”. As for the nature of that culture .… Certainly there seems to have been a time and a place for Sky’s fabled culture of intellectual curiosity: it did not extend to establishing beyond doubt what was in a mysterious package, or to keeping records a GP might be struck off for failing to maintain. Meanwhile, we have heard more and more about the “culture of fear” spoken about by Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Victoria Pendleton. It is hardly a stretch to speculate that two cultures – the culture of ruthlessly pursued and trumpeted marginal gains, and the culture of fear, worked to cultivate an atmosphere in which whistleblowing was and still is seen as career death. \nEither way, a reckoning is coming. And incidentally, from a storytelling point of view, there is something poetically apt about the nation’s greatest modern sporting success imploding against the backdrop of the past year, as the country is required to define itself anew in the world. For both Britain and British cycling, the time has come to cash those cheques the ego has been writing – and for many, there is a distinct sense that the much-cherished self-image is going to take a battering. The suspicion grows that we have been played for fools by people whose charlatanry is becoming increasingly apparent. And of course, the view from abroad is rather different from the one at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T13:41:52.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
