Credit Alex Brandon/Associated Press Mark Morgan, who has led the United States Border Patrol for just over four months, will leave the agency just days after President Trump announced plans to increase the number of agents, according to a statement Thursday from Customs and Border Protection , which oversees the agency. Mr. Morgan told senior Border Patrol officials that he had been asked to resign, said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak to the news media. The official described staff members as shocked. Mr. Morgan’s last day at the agency, which has more than 20,000 agents and is responsible for border security, is Tuesday. He could not be reached for comment. Mr. Moran had expressed a desire to stay at the agency in the Trump administration, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about internal staffing issues, said Mr. Moran had sent an internal email to Border Patrol staff members after the election criticizing the immigration enforcement policies of President Barack Obama and his Homeland Security secretary, Jeh C. Johnson. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The official said it appeared to be an attempt by Mr. Morgan to please the incoming administration, which had made border security a key campaign platform. Mr. Morgan, a former F.B.I. agent, was appointed chief in June and took over in October. He was the first chief in the agency’s 93-year history who had never worked as a border patrol agent. He had led the internal affairs office at Customs and Border Protection before taking over the Border Patrol. His appointment drew criticism from the National Border Patrol Council, the union for Border Patrol workers, which said an insider should have been appointed to head the agency. The union endorsed Mr. Trump during the election, and the union’s president, Brandon Judd, also served on Mr. Trump’s transition team. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
