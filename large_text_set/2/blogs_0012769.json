Notable Recent Union Efforts in the South The union vote came almost two years after the machinists called off a scheduled vote at Boeing’s South Carolina facilities amid what they described as widespread misinformation from management and unrelenting pressure from local politicians. That setback capped a stretch of high-profile losses for unions across the South. Workers at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., narrowly voted down a union in 2014. In 2011, production and maintenance workers at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco in North Carolina narrowly rejected a union, the third defeat in an organizing effort that had gone on for more than six and a half years. In South Carolina, interviews with Boeing workers suggested that the union had a legitimate chance of succeeding because the company had failed to defuse some of the frustrations it had promised to address before the previously scheduled vote. Chief among them was what workers described as management’s unfair approach to evaluating workers and handing out raises and promotions. Workers and at least one recent manager also complained that instructions for performing their jobs seemed to change from month to month and said that a union would bring more consistency to their work lives. “The union also affects your immediate managers,” Al Reatz, who retired from Boeing as a manager in September, said in a recorded message to workers at a pro-union rally on Monday. “They can start coming in in the mornings, and they’ll also know what they’re doing each day.” Photo The Boeing plant in North Charleston, S.C.

The company implied to workers that a union would drive a wedge between them and management, which the union strongly disputed. Organizers said that workers could seek the help of a union steward if they had a problem on the job but that they would otherwise be free to deal with managers on their own. Boeing also dwelled on the machinists’ union’s opposition to its 2009 decision to open a second Dreamliner assembly line in South Carolina. At the time, the union argued that opening the plant would undermine the protected right to strike of tens of thousands of Boeing workers in Washington State, and the machinists filed a charge against the company with the National Labor Relations Board.
