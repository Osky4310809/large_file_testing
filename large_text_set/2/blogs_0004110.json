Markey (D-Mass.) released the following statement on President Donald Trump’s executive order that would roll back consumer and investor protections through revisions to laws and regulations enacted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. \n“President Trump hasn’t met a wall he didn’t like until today when he tore down the well-constructed wall that protects consumers from Wall Street greed. The President promised Americans he would root out the influence of big banks and special interests, but today he handed the keys back to the very institutions responsible for driving our economy off a cliff in 2008. \n\n“Today, President Trump stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Wall Street bankers and executives and signed executive orders that put our entire financial system at risk by removing safeguards that protect consumers and seniors. This is a preview of coming attractions for a White House that today promoted Wall Street profits over Main Street interests.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:10:59.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
