I’m sorry, that’s not a dog. That is an iguana. That doesn’t really change my feelings though, because it’s still a very good iguana. \nIt’s so good, that tennis player Tommy Haas stopped to take a selfie with it.\nThen, it made a break for the other side of the court and eventually got carried off, which was sad. Let the iguana live! It just wanted in on the sports action!\nI was glad to hear some boos mixed in with the cheers as it got carried away.\nOne more time, let’s watch this mad dash across the court.\nLook at him go!! I can’t stop watching him run!\nThis reminds me of the iconic Planet Earth II iguana that runs from all the snakes. What an icon. Perhaps this is one of its brethren. Both are some iconic lizards.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:01:34.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
