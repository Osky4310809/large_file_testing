I haven't heard about the story. I am preparing for a game on Wednesday and that is all I am concentrating on.” \nEverton will be looking for a fourth successive Premier League victory when they line up against the Potters, with Ronald Koeman’s side having returned to form in 2017. \nColeman added: “We have been playing well recently. We got off to a decent start - then it was a tricky spell - when the top six pulled away in that period. \n\"We have been left to play catch-up on them. We want to stay in touch. As a player, as a team, you want to look up, rather than down. \n“The top six are difficult to compete with, because of the money they have, the number of talented players within their squads, but we have to try and hold onto their tails. We are five points off. We have to believe.” \nOne man who will not be aiding that cause is Darron Gibson, who joined David Moyes' Sunderland along with Brian Oviedo on Monday. \n'Arsenal wasn't the right move for me' \nColeman believes the move will prove beneficial to his fellow Irishman and help to push him back into international contention. \nHe said: “Darron is a very talented footballer. His passing range is right up there with the very best. If he is getting plenty of games and regular football, I wouldn’t be surprised at all.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T15:15:00.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
