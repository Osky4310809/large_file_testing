It's an aesthetic the bar has embraced by tacking cowboy boots to the ceiling and holding spirit-hunting missions over the years. The bar's history may be a little less storied in reality, however, save for a few savory bits. First opened as a saloon and hotel by Jacob Rhine, the establishment was later sold to Carl Berendson, a Danish immigrant. less Clayton Club, Clayton Founded: 1873 Widely regarded as haunted by East Bay locals, Clayton Club is said to be frequented by ghosts of the Wild West.

Many years later, Berendson's daughter said her father died the same year after driving a vehicle off a bridge. In 1959 it was bought by a new family, and later restored in 1996. Today, it operates as a bar, and still welcomes the motifs of the early era of its founding, serving beer, holding chili cook-offs , and telling a ghost story or two. less The Clayton Historical Society maintains that during Prohibition years, the business survived by offering \"non-alcoholic drinks, meals and entertainment,\" but a San Francisco Chronicle article dated April 1926 ... more Image 11 of 22 The Saloon, San Francisco Founded: 1861 Many maintain that The Saloon, as it's known today, is the oldest bar in San Francisco.

Still, Elixir is quite old. Records verifying the exact age of the old-timey saloon are, unsurprisingly, difficult to find, but that much can be blamed on the pretty pastoral existence of the early days of the Mission District , as well as the vague records about when Guerrero and 16th Streets were graded to allow for construction. less Elixir, San Francisco Founded: 1858 (?)

The earliest San Francisco Chronicle mentions of the establishment come in the form of ads seeking laborers; in 1862, interested men were encouraged to come to the 7 Mile House to fill out applications to work on the San Jose railroad. Since then, the bar has recorded an impious past . It has been used at various times as a brothel, a bootlegger's respite, and a Mafia gambling den. 7 Mile House, Brisbane Founded: 1853 Now flanked by a PG&E yard and an auto body shop, 7 Mile House is the last of a number of \"mile houses\" — stops for weary travelers to take a break and rest their horses — Photo: Jen Fedrizzi, Special To The Chronicle Image 16 of 22 In more recent years, according to its website, it was known as a hangout for bikers and truck drivers, and then for its burgers, grilled up by \"an elderly lady named Doris.\" These days, it operates as a fun bar and Filipino restaurant, as a good spot to watch a game and nosh on some pork adobo. less In more recent years, according to its website, it was known as a hangout for bikers and truck drivers, and then for its burgers, grilled up by \"an elderly lady named Doris.\" These days, it operates as a fun ... more Photo: Jen Fedrizzi, Special To The Chronicle Image 17 of 22 Founded: 1851 -ish As the story goes, the Old Ship Saloon was built atop the Arkansas, a three-masted ship that either sank at what became Battery and Jackson Streets, or washed ashore at Alcatraz and was towed to the future site of the Old Ship Saloon. (It depends on who you ask.)
