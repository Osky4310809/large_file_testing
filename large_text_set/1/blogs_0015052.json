The Nets have not won since Dec. 26. \nTerrence Ross added 15 points for the Raptors, who opened the game with an 11-0 run but fell behind after the first quarter. \nBrook Lopez had 28 points for the Nets. Caris LeVert and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 14 apiece. \nToronto took a 92-85 lead into the fourth quarter and never looked back.

I'm not going to put a level on where we've got to get to or anything like that. Our thing is to continue to get better. We can't just try to get as many wins as we can and hope it works in the playoffs,\" he said. ... Joseph started for the first time since April 8, 2016, as Kyle Lowry dressed but did not play. . Lucas Nogueria experienced blurred vision and was checked for a concussion in the locker room after being hit in the head during the first quarter. He did not return. . Patrick Patterson (sore left knee), Jared Sullinger (left foot surgery) and Delon Wright (right shoulder surgery) were out. \nNets: Coach Kenny Atkinson discussed what he's seen from veteran Quincy Acy, who is nearing the end of a 10-day contract. \"Love his energy. Love his pop, his aggressiveness and how competitive he is. We'll talk about it after the game with our group. I've been pleasantly surprised in his limited minutes,\" Atkinson said. . Jeremy Lin (strained left hamstring) was out. \nUP NEXT \nRaptors: Visit the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday. \nNets: Visit the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday. %2Fbasketball%2Fnba%2Fderozan-scores-36-raptors-hand-nets-11th-straight-loss%2F", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T06:35:04.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
