Groups like Justice Democrats and Our Revolution have promoted growing from within, while others have flocked to the Green Party for a more progressive bent. But for many Bernie supporters, their big issue is that they still feel betrayed by the DNC and don’t see it making any big attempts to change moving forward. Instead, they see the Democratic party as focusing on blaming Russia for their loss, rather than focusing on what happened internally and what they can do to change moving forward. \nIn an interview with FiveThirtyEight , House minority whip Stephanie Cutter worded it this way: \nI think where we need to agree is that we have to find a way to be relevant to the American people … And, primarily, that’s how we can improve their daily economic life, how they make ends meet, how they send their kids to college, how they buy a house, how they pay a mortgage. Those are the things that most Americans think about on a daily basis, and we have to do a better job in being relevant in that discussion… \nBut not everyone is so nice about it. H.A. Goodman, who became a favorite reporter of the progressive side, has written recently about divisions already appearing in the Democratic party. He talked about divisions from rumors that Clinton might run again in 2020: \nSpeaking of Clinton, even the mere mention of hdr22@clintonemail dot com running again in 2020 sends waves of panic among progressives, not just conservatives. I’ve actually been accused of trying to cause division among Democrats by publicizing her eventual return to politics.” \nHe also wrote : \nInstead of looking in the mirror and evaluating how Obama’s policies or Democratic failures led to a Republican controlled White House and Congress, the same flawed strategies are being repeated by America’s liberal establishment.” \nBernie Sanders himself has been even harsher with his words. In a New York Times article in March , he said: \nCertainly there are some people in the Democratic Party who want to maintain the status quo. They would rather go down with the Titanic so long as they have first-class seats.” \nAfter Tom Perez was made chair of the DNC over Keith Ellison, this concern among Bernie Sanders supporters grew stronger, ABC News noted . Winnie Wong, founder of People for Bernie, told ABC News that she thought people would have less optimism and faith, and voter turnout would be depressed, if Perez won. She predicted a “Dem stagnation” rather than a Dem exit. And some believe it’s happening. In 2016, the DNC rolled back restrictions on federal lobbyists and PACs’ donating to the DNC. At the time, activist Fred Wertheimer said : \nIt is a major step in the wrong direction. And it is completely out of touch with the clear public rejection of the role of political money in Washington.” \nThe ban had been introduced by former   in 2008 as part of his promise to change how Washington works. In 2017, when the ban was brought back up again, the DNC voted against the ban again, Townhall reported . Justice Democrats responded on Twitter to the news: With its rubber stamp on corporate lobbying, Dems just doubled down on the strategy that lost party 1000+ seats over last 8 years. #DNCChair \n— Justice Democrats (@justicedems) February 25, 2017 \nA Politico article from this month spoke about establishment Democrats’ fears that the more progressive wing would hurt their chances in Southern states. Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams said: \nMy hope is that Our Revolution — or anyone else — will understand that purity to a progressive ideal does not [necessarily] mean purity in service of the community.” \nMeanwhile, progressive activists feel that establishment Democrats see them as part of the problem, rather than the solution — a viewpoint which could hurt the party’s future chances. Mark Longabaugh, a Sanders adviser, told Politico: \nThe fact that, broadly speaking, candidates and operatives in the establishment wing see the Bernie wing — the activist part of the party — as a problem? That’s a problem in and of itself.” \nBernie supporters on Twitter are voicing similar concerns on the Birdie Sanders anniversary: Happy #BirdieSanders day.
