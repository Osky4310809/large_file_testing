LeEco entered India in 2016, and placed a huge bet on marketing with advertising budget as high as ₹80 crore ($12m) a month according to some reports.\nThe move is seen as a precursor to the company’s withdrawal from the Indian market, while focusing on China and the US. Alex Li, Chief Operating Officer of LeEco India has confirmed the exit of the two executives to ET but has denied any plans to exit the market or liquidate stock. He’s called the layoff as ‘recalibration and reimagining of the business in India’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T11:17:19.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
