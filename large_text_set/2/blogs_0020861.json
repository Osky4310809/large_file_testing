The center serves as JW’s national headquarters in Russia. \nDean Jacek, spokesperson of JW in the Philippines, said they filed a formal protest against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights and the United Nations Human Rights Committee. \nHe said the rule may be used to “freeze the Watch Tower Society’s assets” and confiscate office properties and all Kingdom Halls in Russia. \nRussia recently banned JW publications, including Bibles, which do not incite to violence, he said. \n“We are not engaged in any extremist activity. We simply want to freely carry out our worship and our Bible education work peacefully,” he said. — GOBLETH MOULIC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:09:03.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
