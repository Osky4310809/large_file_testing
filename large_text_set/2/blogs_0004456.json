Not like that. Shares The highs \nJames Davenport: It’s lit \nWhen Dying Light came out, I let it go gently into the night. I thought the Dead Island series was awful—a campy co-op zombie RPG that couldn’t sustain my interest in a cliched setting with dull, padded design. Hell, I thought I was done with zombies, period. (Resident Evil 7 doesn’t count, technically.) But recently, a few cool cats from the PC Gamer community Discord server brought up Dying Light when it went on sale over the holiday. I trust their judgement, so I couldn’t stop mulling it over. Last weekend, I figured I’d just buy it for science at the very least—if I hated it, so what? I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on shitty pizza throughout my life. \nBut Dying Light is good. Like, really good. As much as I lament open world busywork games, Dying Light gets it right. An intuitive, playful parkour system, the best zombie smashing physics in any game ever (their skulls crunch and pop), and a setting that doesn’t feel worn out in the zombie canon make for a silly, spooky time. Zombie swarms are no joke, and night is pitch black and genuinely threatening. Dying Light juggles so many things I like in games—co-op shenanigans, horror, satisfying progression, and platforming—without dropping a ball. I’m early on, but looking forward to more. \nJoe Donnelly: Resident refill \nSunless Skies hit its Kickstarter target in just four hours this week, however this wasn't my highest point. Instead, this week was the first chance I'd had to take a proper run at Resident Evil 7, and I've been glued to it since. On launch day, I was only able to sink around an hour or so into Capcom's latest serving of the venerable survival horror series—at which point I thought it felt entirely un-Resident Evil-like. \nThat wasn't really an issue for me, but, a few hours later and I'm now reveling in its familiar incongruous maps, puzzles, and horrid adversaries, as I scramble around the Bakers’ dilapidated country estate with little ammo and even less first aid tonics. The switch to first-person was a bold design move, and while I was open-minded about a complete shift in direction, I'm actually really pleased it managed to maintain what I love about the now 20-years old series. And . \nSamuel Roberts: Alone but not lonely \nI haven't played Battlefront since July of last year, when I sampled the offline modes that DICE generously patched into the game (though they arguably should've been there to begin with). I always meant to go back to play them some more, but nothing quite lured me back. There was always a sense that as gorgeous Battlefront was, it was rushed out in time for The Force Awakens. It felt a little barebones, and one of the obvious missing elements was a single-player campaign. \nWell, this week EA reaffirmed that Battlefront 2 is coming in 2017 with a full campaign mode. Between Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 in 2016, both of EA's shooters had more substantial offline options than we're typically used to from big multiplayer games—though naturally that comes down to the talent of the devs rather than the company publishing them. Nonetheless, it can be seen as a sign of the times that publishers value singleplayer offerings again. I'm up for a fun interactive Star Wars story this year. \nPhil Savage: Go Pro \nHitman is out now. It was also 'out' in 2016, when it launched its intro pack, and again later in 2016, when it released the last of its episodes. Now it's out again, as part of a complete bundle released to those physical media formats that no PC gamer has bought for about a decade. This is relevant, because of an update released to the PC version adding a new bonus mission and a 'Professional' difficulty option. \nThe new difficulty is great, by which I mean it's hard. I attempted a run at Sapienza, and failed horribly and repeatedly. This was a welcome change. After multiple runs through, I know every nook and cranny of the Italian resort. But the new difficulty tweaks things just enough to make it difficult again. That flower delivery guy who gives you such easy access to Caruso? He now stands in view of his colleague. It's almost like he knew. \nYou can only save once, which ratchets up the tension nicely. I'm still a bit surprised that IO kept the option to non-lethally subdue any target—a feature of this Hitman that always felt a little too overpowered. Nonetheless, a Silent Assassin rating is going to be a difficult thing to achieve, making this a great addition for the truly committed contract killers. If you've been on the fence about Hitman and its episodic structure, it's now fully, completely, 100% finished (at least until Season 2). I recommend giving it a shot. \nChris Livingston: Conan The Nardsdanglin' \nYeah, so, my news out of Conan Exiles in Early Access is both good and bad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:52:38.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
