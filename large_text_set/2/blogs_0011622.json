Why? Someone snuck into the Chicago locker room and stole MJ’s No. 23. The only backup jersey the Bulls had was a No. 12 with no name on it. No matter: MJ threw it on and dropped 49 points on the Magic. \nSee? Tom Brady isn’t the only No. 12 who gets his jersey stolen. \nBut really, the NBA Store should’ve released a Terry Catledge throwback. The less-than-legendary Magic big man scored 34 points to lift Orlando to a 135-129 overtime win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:59:48.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
