The NBI is also ordered to replace all existing formats with the new multi-purpose clearance. \n“Secretary Aguirre’s swift action on our suggestion is admirable. This would go a long way not only to spare our people from a lot of difficulties in getting NBI clearance but also save them time and money,” said Alvarez. \nThe Speaker said Aguirre issued last Feb. 15 Department Circular 017, directing NBI Director Dante Gierran to scrap the present specific-purpose clearance and instead issue a multi-purpose clearance.   \nImplementation of the new multi-purpose NBI clearance will begin 15 days after appropriate notices have been published in at least two newspapers of general circulation. \nIn addition to implementing a multi-purpose clearance, Alvarez had asked the NBI to modernize its system not only to increase efficiency but also to address other problems in the clearance procedures.
