I’m fed up with people, especially men, commenting on how I look.” Kate denied any work on her face (Photo: Snapchat) The star said she was make-up free on Snapchat (Photo: Snapchat) Kate says she has eyelash extensions on but that's it (Photo: Snapchat) \nPointing to her face, Kate added: “So here we are guys. I have no make up on. I’ve got a retainer in so my mouth looks funny. I can move my forehead, funny enough. Hmm…” \nShe then said: “And for the people who will say I’ve got make-up on, I haven’t! I’ve got individual extensions on [my eyelashes], but, yeah, stop going in on my face. This is me!” \nKate - who has admitted to some fillers in her lips - added in an interview with OK magazine that she would never edit her social media photos as she doesn't want people in real life to not recognise her. \n\"I’ve got this thing that I don’t want people to see me in real life and think I look worse, I want people to see me in real life and think I look better,\" she said.\" \n\"Especially when you're single, I wouldn’t want a guy to be like, 'Oh gosh, you look nothing like your Instagram'.\" Read More At Boot Camp in Ibiza with a friend (Photo: Twitter) Posing in a bikini during a break at Boot Camp (Photo: Instagram) Read More TOWIE's Kate Wright endures \"tough week\" at Boot Camp but says famous body is \"nearly there\" \nKate has been overseas at the No 1 Boot Camp in Ibiza during the past week, working on her famous figure. \nShe shared a photo to Instagram last week showing her looking slim and toned in her figure hugging sports wear, but told fans her dream body wasn’t quite there yet. \n“It’s been a tough but amazing week @no1_bootcamp so far ... but we r not giving up just yet ... #nearlythere #hardworkpaysoff,\" said Kate. \nBut fans were quick to tell Kate they thought her figure was already amazing, and there was no \"nearly there\" about it!
