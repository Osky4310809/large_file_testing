The award winning group is used to being in high demand. \nWhat they are “not” used to is having to cancel out on a gig. \nThe chorus was chosen out of 800 other groups to perform at St. Anthony’s Basilica in Italy for Easter Sunday Mass, but they had to bow out. The reason: A group threatened to sue them. \nA former school committee member, Leslie Lathrop, contacted Americans United For Separation of Church and State. \nThat group wrote a letter to the school superintendent saying in part “Taking public school students to worship services as part of a public school activity is a flagrant violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution.” Poster promoting chorus’s trip to Italy (WBZ-TV) \nThe school district decided not to fight it in court. \nMembers of the chorus WBZ spoke to are upset because they believe it has nothing to do with religion. \nThey pointed out they had performed at churches before and no one complained. \nLeslie Lothrop knows people are angry at her. She denied suggestions she filed the complaint because she’s Jewish, saying “I’m just concerned the chorus adheres to what the statutes say.” \nThe group will still travel to Italy and Croatia in April for several performances. \nAll of their trips are privately funded, no taxpayer money is used.
