Right from choosing offbeat roles to talking about unsafe laws for women to making videos that help people understand the concept of gender equality; she's done it all. In a day and age where people separate themselves from something as basic as these tenets, simply because they don't understand the term \"feminism\", it is refreshing to meet Kalki, who apart from the many other hats she wears, is a proud feminist who is always ready to fight for an equal world. \nOn the occasion of International Women's Day, we sat down with Kalki to have a little chat with her about ... what else but ... Kalki, what is your vision for feminism in 2017? \nAt this point I would just want the term feminism to be cleared. There is so much misunderstanding when it comes to the term. It would be really nice to have something as simple as an \"ABC on feminism\". We need to communicate more with people and tell them that it means nothing but gender equality. It's completely okay to overtalk about a topic rather than not talk at all. Even if one or two people Google it up, after listening to me, I'll feel happy. \nI also think we are on the correct path for now when it comes to gender equality. Sure, there's still a lot to be done but for any change to happen, it takes three generations. The first one will just adapt to it and debate over it, the second one will actually understand it and the third will implement it. We are the first generation, getting blood on our hands breaking the world. But we'll get there. \nI like the fact that we have also started talking about things more openly now. Something as simple as a talk on paternity leaves brings in men in the equation of taking responsibility for the child and that's a great discussion to have in terms of feminism. Feminism (thankfully) is a world topic right now and we need to continue talking about it and debating it until we get it right. \nI think in the last couple of years, the fact that feminism has become \"cool\" makes me happy. There are so many people who now want to be a part of this debate. Feminism is becoming more commercialised and that is beautiful. Even in Bollywood, movies like Piku and Queen are happening and even if they are say only two films the fact that they are there speaks a lot. \nIn 2017, I think we need to keep continuing to talk about feminism and maybe make a video giving people a simple, accurate meaning of the word so that we are all on the same page Photo credits: BCCL / Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T10:45:09.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
