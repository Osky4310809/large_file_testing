Soulja Boy & Chris Brown Get Ready To Rumble \nTwo days into the year, Soulja Boy starts some mess with Chris Brown , accusing him of dialing him up for liking a picture of his ex-girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, and wanting to fight. \nChris Brown, of course, denies he ever called him and offers Big Soulja a “grown man ass whopping” while dragging Kae in the process. \nThis whole ordeal caused Chris and Kae to start beefing . He snapped back at her Instagram comment and admitted to busting down all of her friends while asking, “HOW DO WE KNOW YOU AGAIN?” \nBack to Soulja and Chris. The two are now slated to fight in an official boxing match. Soulja brought Breezy’s daughter Royalty into the equation and Breezy is pissed. \n“Stop saying shit about my fucking daughter, bro,” Chris said in an IG video clip. “This not no fucking game, my nigga. Now you playing with something else, that’s gonna take the shit somewhere else.” \nSoulja Boy is now training with Floyd Mayweather and Chris has been prepping to fight with the help of Mike Tyson .

DXclusives: La’Britney & Master P \nDetroit’s own La’Britney has made an impression on a few celebrities like R. Kelly and 50 Cent, and in an interview with DX, she explains her creative process that caught the attention of so many. \n“I found this app that was a collage app that allowed me to create videos by piecing multiple videos together,” she explained to HipHopDX . “Then I did a couple of videos where I was just singing and thought it would be dope to recreate beats with household items. That’s how I started doing them. Just adding pieces of my talent into the ‘LA Mixes.’ Then, I started integrating choreography and dance. It went from me just singing with myself to me singing and creating the beats. It helped because you got to know me as an artist in 15 seconds.” \nElsewhere, Master P spoke with DX and gave his insight on the whole Soulja Boy and Chris Brown debacle. \n“I think it’s going to be hard because this is not a time for that,” he tells Justin Hunte. “A lot of people die, we have police brutality and a lot of these artists now can’t even move the way they need to move because it’s so much conflict and so much beef. I just don’t entertain it to be honest with you. I come from a different millennium where we’re just different. I feel like if something happens to any one of these guys, it’s a waste of talent. I would hate to see that. So, I’m definitely praying for them and hope this blows over.” \nAren’t we all? Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You!
