Ending. Summary. \nOnly one team's season ended this perfectly, but every team's season can be perfectly summed up in just three words. \nWith a hat tip to his \"executive director of bits\", Colin Cowherd shares three words to sum up every NFL team's 2016 season , from the Cleveland Browns to the New England Patriots (hint: they're not \"Super Bowl champs\"). \nCopyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP Browns: One-win wonders \nThe Browns beat the Chargers 20-17 on Dec. 24 to avoid going 0-16. That qualifies as a Christmas miracle. 49ers: Ctr Alt Delete \nMeaning: Reboot everything after a 2-14 season. Owner Jed York already has, replacing coach Chip Kelly with Kyle Shanahan and GM Trent Baalke with John Lynch. Will Colin Kaepernick be the next to be replaced? Bears: Cutler, Hoyer, Barkley \nThe Bears started three QBs due to injuries, and won the same number of games. As a result, neither Jay Cutler (6), Brian Hoyer (2) nor Matt Barkley is sure to return. Jaguars: London's best team \nThe Jags, who have played a game in London every season since 2013 and will continue to do so until 2020, won there for the second time on Oct. 2. However, they won only two more games all season. FOX Sports' Cameron DaSilva wrote that if the NFL wants to grow the game, it should stop sending Jacksonville to the UK. Getty Images Getty Images Rams: LOSS Angeles Rams \nGet it? Jared Goff and the Rams lost 12 games in their first season back in LA. Jets: Fitz the bed \nRyan Fitzpatrick threw 17 INTs and just 12 TDs after re-signing with New York, getting benched in favor of Geno Smith and Bryce Petty. Quite a mess. Dennis Schneidler USA TODAY Sports Chargers: Lost to Browns \nCan't escape it. Then \"moved to LA\". NFL: Carolina Panthers at Miami Dolphins \nNov 24, 2013; Miami Gardens, FL, USA; Miami Dolphins defensive end Dion Jordan (95) reacts after sacking Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton (1) during the second quarter at Sun Life Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports Steve Mitchell USA TODAY Sports Bengals: 'Playmakers' on three \nCincinnati broke the huddle with that mantra, but never had enough playmakers as coach Marvin Lewis missed the playoffs for the first time in six seasons. Bills: Rex was here \nAnd then he wasn't, fired at the tail end of a second straight eight-loss season. Saints: Brees needs help \nBrees, at age 37, led the league in passing yards (5,208), but New Orleans finished 7-9 for the third straight season. Mark J. Rebilas USA TODAY Sports Eagles: Wentz beats Goff \nHe didn't get a chance to do it head to head, but rookie Carson Wentz showed he was superior to the QB drafted one spot ahead of him, No. 1 overall pick Jared Goff of the Rams. Cardinals: Someone call Romo \nArizona was expected to challenge for NFC supremacy but failed to live up to expectations, and while coach Bruce Arians said he expects Carson Palmer to be the QB again next season and not Tony Romo, some people believe the longtime Cowboys QB could make the Cards contenders again. Getty Images Getty Images Colts: Wasting Luck's prime \nLuck rebounded from injury with a statiscally solid season but missed the playoffs for the second straight year, and he will turn 28 when next season begins, still seeking his first Super Bowl appearance. Vikings: We nailed September \nThey sure did, going 3-0 behind newly acquired starting QB Sam Bradford en route to a 5-0 start. But they lost eight of their last 11 games to miss the playoffs. Ravens: Our kicker's awesome \nHe sure is. Tucker made 38 of 39 field goals and all of his extra points this season, earning his second trip to the Pro Bowl, where he did this at practice . Baltimore, on the other hand, wasn't as awesome, stumbling to an 8-8 finish after a 3-0 start. TNS via Getty Images Baltimore Sun Redskins: Don't like that \nKirk Cousins' campaign to prove he's Washington's franchise QB finished with a whimper, not a bold statement, as Cousins came up short in a must-win season finale against a Giants team that had nothing to play for. Titans: Not terrible anymore \nNo they're not, finishing with their first winning record since 2011 behind the improved play of QB Marcus Mariota. Buccaneers: Hey, some progress \nIndeed, the Bucs enjoyed their first winning season since 2010 under new head coach Dirk Koetter. USA TODAY Sports Kim Klement Broncos: Super Bowl hangover \nThe defending champs missed the playoffs as their dominant defense couldn't make up for their struggles on offense. Lions: More like kittens \nDetroit's promising season ended with four straight losses that cost them the NFC North title and a home game in the playoffs. Playing at Seattle, the Lions bowed out 26-6 in the wild card round. Dolphins: Must switch divisions \nMiami made the playoffs under first-year coach Adam Gase, but New England won the AFC East for the eighth straight season. USA TODAY Sports Reinhold Matay Giants: Hole in boat \nOdell Beckham and the wide receivers' trip to Miami to hang out on a yacht before their playoff game ended up sinking their season, as OBJ melted down after a week under the microscope. Raiders: Derek Carr-ted away \nNot funny for Oakland fans, who saw their return to the top derailed by Carr's fractured leg. Getty Images Getty Images Texans: Worst contract ever \nBrock Osweiler failed to live up to his $72 million free agent deal, throwing more INTs (16) than TDs (15), getting benched and then struggling in his playoff debut. Getty Images Seahawks: Window closing fast \nInjuries helped stall Seattle, which came up short for the third straight season since winning Super Bowl 48. Chiefs: Playoff exit kings \nKansas City won the AFC West but lost to Pittsburgh in the playoffs — its 10th loss in its past 11 postseason games dating to 1993. Cowboys: Tony Romo? No-mo \nAfter going down with a preseason injury and losing his starting job to rookie Dak Prescott, it appears Romo's days in Dallas as a high-priced backup are soon to be over. Bill Streicher USA TODAY Sports Packers: Nothing but Rodgers \nThat's pretty much how it seemed by the time Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay bowed out of the playoffs against Matt Ryan and the Falcons. The injury-plagued Packers just couldn't compete at the end. Curtis Compton Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP Steelers: Not buttoned up \nYes we're talking about Antonio Brown — though more about his flagged TD celebrations and Facebook Live video than about what he wore to NFL Honors . Kevin Jairaj Falcons: Needed bigger lead \nTurns out 28-3 isn't a big enough lead against Tom Brady and the Pats in the Super Bowl. Who knew? Getty Images Getty Images Patriots: No days off \nThe crowd at the Pats' championship rally might not have carried Bill Belichick's impromptu chant, but the players lived it in winning the Super Bowl.
