Jeremytold a guest he has \"the smallest penis in the world\" (Photo: ITV) Matt was shocked (Photo: ITV) Until he found out it came from his ex Judith (Photo: ITV) Judith was insistent Matt was the dad (Photo: ITV) Her mum got involved too (Photo: ITV) \nAnd then, reading out her notes, Jeremy told Matt: “You’d be a rubbish dad and you’ve got the smallest penis in the world!” \nHe quickly insisted he was just the messenger, and these weren’t his thoughts, however. \nBut then, shocked by Judith‘s admission she’d slept with four different men in one month, Jeremy went one step further and started asking Security Steve how many people he’d slept with ever. \nAs the rest of his camera crew backed away in fear, he started questioning them too. Then Jezza started asking his crew how many people they'd slept with (Photo: ITV) He even asked Security Steve! (Photo: ITV) But he wasn't preparing to be asked back (Photo: ITV) \nBut he wasn’t expecting one of them to ask him back. \nShocked, but refusing to answer the question, Jeremy backed off immediately! \nMeanwhile, Judith was insisting Matt is the father of her child because he “looks the spitting image of her” and isn’t jealous of his new girlfriend Sarah “because she’s a hippo”. \nIt turned out Matt isn’t the father of her baby, and Judith is still in the dark who the father really is. Judith never did find out who the father of her baby is (Photo: ITV) But Matt and Sarah are happy (Photo: ITV) \nMatt and Sarah are still together and are happy. \n*The Jeremy Kyle Show continues on ITV1 weekdays at 9.25am Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T14:03:03.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
