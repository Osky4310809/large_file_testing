According to tradition, the jewelry is supposed to repel evil. Credit Ryan Christopher Jones for The New York Times In the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn — known for its party-fishing boats and waterfront restaurants — there is only one store specializing in evil eye amulets. Zigana Gift Shop, a humble storefront near the corner of Avenue W and Ocean Avenue, is an unlikely pilgrimage site offering spiritual protection for immigrants and others. The store has no sign outside, but hundreds of unblinking blue eyes peer through two windows. The amulets come in many shapes: butterflies, elephants, fish, dolphins — all adorned with the evil eye, concentric circles of blue and white. Charms drape from the ceiling and hang from the back wall, three or four layers deep. “This is a very, very old tradition,” said Fazil Cengiz, a gray-haired cabdriver from Coney Island, shopping at Zigana on a recent evening. “They give protection. Inner protection.” Evil-eye charms are believed to ward off jealousy and impart protection to their owner. They have been used for centuries in the Middle East, Asia, throughout the Mediterranean and beyond, spread along trading routes. Now they are found in every New York City borough. “If someone needs evil eyes, he comes over here,” said Adil Kostereli, 52, the shop’s owner. “For evil eyes, it’s just me.” In 1985, a Turkish immigrant named Kazim Nail opened a video shop in this location. He called it Uludag, after a mountain in his home country. He kept a small selection of charms on the back wall. In time, the protective talismans became the shop’s specialty. By 2010, when Mr. Kostereli took over, the store was well known for amulets, handpicked in Istanbul markets. Mr. Kostereli renamed the shop after the Zigana mountain pass near his hometown on the Black Sea.

Jews come for Kabbalistic bracelets, glass hamsas or strings of ceramic pomegranates. Muslims want talismans adorned with Quranic verses or the name of the Prophet Muhammad. Christians prefer crosses or ornamental horseshoes. Others make special requests, like evil eye amulets one or two feet wide. Mr. Kostereli motions with his hands, as if delivering a fishing yarn. “Sometimes they want them as big as this,” he says, spreading his hands wide. \n  On a recent evening, one customer came in and straightaway pointed to an item in the window, a wire tree decorated with eyes on each branch. He paid and quietly slipped outside. Tuncay Coban, 42, stepped inside after him. For Mr. Coban, the amulets are something of a quaint cultural custom. “The protection part, I don’t believe it,” he said. “I like it, it’s nice-looking.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
