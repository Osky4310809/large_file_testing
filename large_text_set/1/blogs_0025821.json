Durkin | 7:34   \nThe 53-Iraqi man who was detained at New York’s JFK Airport for 19 hours spoke with members of the press after his release today, revealing a curious answer when asked about his feelings of President Donald J. Trump . \nHameed Khalid Darweesh , after thanking the crowd and sharing his feelings of appreciation towards the United States — which he calls, “land of freedom, the land of the right,”— said of Trump: \n“I like him. But I don’t know. This is a policy, I don’t know. He is a president not a normal person.” \nThe reaction can be seen clearly on the face of New York Congressman Jerry Nadler (D), who rallied with the crowd at JFK airport Saturday to speak against the Trump administration’s policies. \nIraq is one of the seven Muslim-majority countries directly affected by President Trump’s executive action signed Friday, along with Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya; a 90-day ban on citizens entering the country from those those nations has been imposed. The executive order also calls for the suspension of any refugees entering   months and an indefinite barring of refugees from Syria specifically. \nDarweesh, who had ties to the U.S.   interpreter, continued Saturday upon being released, “I have a special immigration visa in my pocket, me and my family, because I worked for the U.S. government. I support the U.S. government from the other side of the world. But when I come here, they said no. They treat me like I break the rule or did something wrong. That surprised me.” \nWatch above via Fox News.— \nHave a tip we should know?
