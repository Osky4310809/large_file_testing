It was Cullinan whose \"human error\" is blamed for handing Beatty the wrong envelope, with the accountant's rampant social media use cited as a factor in distracting him during the Oscars. \nThe Hollywood Reporter added that Cullinan, whose social media activity was previously known to organizers, was told to abstain from backstage cellphone usage at the 2017 ceremony, but he \"disobeyed\" orders. \nWith the addition of a third balloting official in the control room, organizers hope to drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to catch an error if it should occur; in the case of the 2017 Oscars, the La La Land cast and crew had already took the stage and began delving into their acceptance speeches before the gaffe was uncovered. \nOscars organizers will also routinely review the accounting firm's protocols to avoid another much-publicized disaster.
