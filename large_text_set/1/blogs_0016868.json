Gillan says that the second Guardians of the Galaxy will provide more of what everyone loved about the first. \n“I’m so excited for people to see it! I just feel like it’s all of the best elements of the first one, just amplified,” Gillan tells The Hollywood Reporter . “It’s even better – it’s funnier, the music’s even better … the second album is a blinder. It’s great. And in the first one everyone was being established. Now that that’s out of the way, you really get to delve into all of their dilemmas and things like that. I think family would really be the main theme of the thing. And my character Nebula is dealing with a whole lot of stuff there – we see a whole new side to her. A much more human side actually, where we understand how truly awful and difficult her daddy issues are.” \nGillan also offered a brief and vague comment about Nebula’s role in Avengers: Infinity War . \n“Yeah, she’s making a cheeky appearance there,” Gillan says. “I don’t know how much I’m allowed to say, but I’m pretty happy with how much she gets to do.” \nMORE: Peter Dinklage's New Hairstyle Hints At Avengers: Infinity War Role / Josh Brolin Ready To Transform Into Thanos For Avengers Infinity War / Who Is Peter Dinklage Playing In Avengers: Infinity War? / Is Peter Dinklage Playing MODOK In Avengers: Infinity War? / Zoe Saldana Confirms Gamora For Avengers: Infinity War / Chris Hemsworth Says He Still Hasn't Seen The Avengers: Infinity War Script / Avengers: Infinity War To Film in Scotland / Avengers: Infinity War Is Casting Extras For Alien Roles / Avengers: Infinity War Sets Production Start Date / Avengers: Infinity War Directors Tease Mysterious New Prop Video \nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos.
