I thought without those scenes my performance would be regarded as satisfactory and it won’t be appreciated that much. Despite that, people loved it. I am very happy,” Kangana said at a media interaction here on Friday. Shattered about my top-notch scenes being edited: Kangana Ranaut “Some of my favourite scenes, which were important for the graph of my work were edited. I prepare my character’s graph in a linear pattern so when I saw the film Vishal Ji explained why the editing was legitimate,” the “ Queen ” actor said. On being asked about compliments from the industry, she said: “More than I expected. Many from industry have complimented and messaged me which is a very sweet gesture.” The period romantic drama, directed by Vishal Bharadwaj stars Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan, besides Kangana in lead roles.
