On Wednesday, he pushed back at a suggestion of a future dirt-digging threat by poking fun at himself with the #tapperdirtfile hashtag. All on the same day that Donald Trump started the “Easy D” craze , so it’s been an interesting one.\nTapper has little patience for Trump’s labeling of his network as “fake news.” He subsequently called out White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for Trump’s immigration ban and managed to get Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway to admit CNN is not fake news . This may not have sat well with some Trump fans, and someone suggested that the GOP might be going after him. Tapper quickly brushed this off.\nWatch for @jaketapper to become target of GOP operatives. High desire to destroy him.\n— Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) February 8, 2017 \nAnd good morning to you too! https://t.co/4udWXKFcPy \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 8, 2017 \n\nTapper then had some fun while airing some of his own “dirty laundry” with the #tapperdirtfile hashtag.
