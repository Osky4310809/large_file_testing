Thirteen Israelis, ten of them soldiers, also died. \nBoth sides were accused of war crimes by the international community during the three-week conflict. \nA United Nations Fact Finding Mission into the war found that Israel had \"at least in part\" targeted the people of Gaza as a whole as “collective punishment.” Israeli soldiers reveal the brutal truth of Gaza attack Israeli soldiers reveal the brutal truth of Gaza attack 1/4 4/4 AP \nIsrael maintains that Hamas used civilians as human shields during the 2008-2009 offensive, placing them near buildings which were being targeted by the Israel Defence Force (IDF) missiles. \nMs Livni, who is still a Zionist Union party member of the Knesset, told Israel Radio that she had pulled out of the trip for “personal reasons.” \nSince leaving a position in the Justice Ministry in 2014 Ms Livni is no longer entitled to diplomatic immunity, Le Monde reported. \nUnder Belgian law, the authorities have the right to detain a suspect in its territory on crimes related to international law as one of the victims had Belgian citizenship. Gaza marks 10 years of Israeli blockade \nIn a statement, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Nahshon criticised the prospect of Ms Livni’s arrest overseas as a “cynical abuse of the Belgian legal system.” \nMs Livni was previously forced to cancel a 2009 trip to London after a British court issued a warrant for her arrest following an application by UK lawyers acting for Palestinian victims of Cast Lead. \nEuropean pro-Palestinian groups commonly file charges against Israeli officials, the Jerusalem Post says. \nIn some cases, executive orders are issued to avert arrest warrants, or the subjects are warned ahead of their arrival not to visit.
