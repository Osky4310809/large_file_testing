This may not seem tedious when you’re monitoring your Wagyu’s time on the grill, but for pilots pushing their aeronautic abilities to the limit, a flyback is an essential complication. With one simple tap of its 4 o’clock pusher, the murdered-out, 44mm Alpiner 4 Manufacture Chronograph instantly tackles all three functions. Developed in-house, the AL-760 caliber uses only 96 parts to actuate its patented “direct flyback” complication, which is facilitated by its unique, star-shaped column wheel. Buy Now: $4,920 Tudor Heritage Black Bay Bronze \nTudor’s reemergence in the North American market has been a phenomenal success. Led largely by the Pelagos and Black Bay dive watches, Tudor’s modern honoring of its nautical heritage has caused more than one salty dog to question whether he really needs that Rolex Submariner. Making decisions even tougher, the Black Bay is now equipped with Tudor’s in-house MT5601 movement, available first in this bronze version. The signature snowflake hands and near-tropical finish on the bezel and dial are exquisite, especially sitting on the distressed leather band. While the stainless version is just as compelling, the chemical properties of bronze cause this version to develop an incredibly hard, natural coating that also doubles as corrosion resistance in the briny deep. Buy Now: $3,975 IWC Pilot’s Watch Mark XVIII \nThe Mark series by IWC Schaffhausen is one of the most iconic lines of timepieces in horology. Gracing the wrists of discerning flyboys since 1936, IWC’s Pilot watch is characterized by its impeccable legibility and dedication to accuracy in extreme conditions. The new Mark XVIII continues this tradition with a robust, self-winding Sellita calibre inside its antimagnetic, soft-iron inner case. Reduced in size to 40mm (from 41mm with the Mark XVII), this successor now sits in the sweet spot, midway between IWC’s Pilots Watch 36 (36mm) and their Big Pilot (44mm). Other changes include a move to a much cleaner single-window date display and the choice of a vintage-inspired Santoni calf leather strap. Buy Now: $3,950 – $4,950 Grand Seiko SBGA085 \nThe Grand Seiko SBGA085 is easily the engineering marvel of this selection of watches. Powered by a self-winding Spring Drive movement, this Grand Seiko features a 72-hour power reserve and is accurate within 1 second per day. This combination of quartz accuracy and mechanical beauty is owed to Seiko’s ethereal, electro-mechanical Caliber 9R65 movement. The intricacies of the Spring Drive’s inner workings are a rabbit hole of horological geekery; essentially, an electromagnet, known as the Tri-Synchro Regulator (TSR), is employed in lieu of a mechanical escapement, allowing the Grand Seiko to keep time with acute precision. The TSR also perpetuates the continuous sweeping movement of the seconds hand around the 39mm dial. Buy Now: $3,600 Georg Jensen Koppel GMT Power Reserve \nGeorg Jensen is celebrated in design circles for cloaking function with minimalist form. The Koppel GMT Power Reserve watch is a stunning example: its uncluttered appearance belies its intricate complications. Decorated almost solely with black dots, the tiny indices and power reserve meter provide an expanse of white on the 41mm dial. There is a date window stationed inside the 3 o’clock position and a GMT subdial just south of centre. Powered by a Swiss Soprod 9335 self-winding movement, complete with a perlage finish and “GJ” shaped rotor, the Koppel GMT was built and designed for the ultimate aesthete. Buy Now: $3,850 Frederique Constant Manufacture Worldtimer \nIt’s truly rare to find a true world timer at such an accessible figure; but then, Frederique Constant seems to have a habit of doing these things. You would expect that their Manufacture Worldtimer would be powered by a decorated ebauche from some off-the-shelf supplier. Nope. The 26-jewel FC-718 is an in-house creation. Everything is controlled by the pumpkin crown, with the inner ring rotating to denote just which timezone you want to be tracking. The hours between 18:00 and 6:00 on the inner ring have received a dark blue treatment to denote nightfall and make at-a-glance time checks a cinch. A world map decorates much of the dial, save for the large date indicator at the 6 o’clock position. Buy Now: $4,195 Oris ProPilot Altimeter \nIs practicality taken to the extreme still practical? That’s a question for wearers of the Oris ProPilot Altimeter, which features the world’s first mechanical altimeter within an automatic movement. The altimeter sits within a ring underneath the dial, so there’s no intrusion on timekeeping capabilities. The radially knurled bezel and 47mm brushed case complement an earth-toned textile strap. The ProPilot is great conversation starter, a loud, proud, interesting watch that stands apart from the rest of the sub-$5,000 crowd — and for pilots, it’s a tool watch through and through. Buy Now: $3,700 NOMOS Metro Datum Gangreserve \nNomos makes serious watches with award-winning design at a value. Their Metro Datum Gangreserve features an in­-house manufactured movement paired with a simple, Bauhaus-inspired aesthetic. The funky mint color scheme subtly adds personality, while the placement of the power reserve indication playfully nods to creativity. The NOMOS is made in Germany, in the historic town of Glashütte, and you can feel the level of attention that went into each detail. Buy Now: $3,780 Omega Speedmaster Professional \nThe Omega Speedmaster Professional has already stood the test of time — it looks as good now as it did in the 1960s. The Speedmaster has made its mark in the history of space travel (it’s accompanied every manned moon mission in NASA history), and a variety of generations can be had for less than $5,000. New variants carry Omega’s own automatic movements. The Speedmaster looks good with any wardrobe, and makes a great, storied heirloom for generations to come. Buy Now: $4,400 Habring2 Felix \nHabring2 is an independent Austrian manufacture headed by a husband-and-wife team that’s been building their own watches since 2004, winning some prestigious awards in the process. Last year they added their first fully in­-house-manufactured time­-only watch, the Felix. The Felix features a minimal design with a slight case, measuring in at 38.5mm in diameter, and just 7mm in thickness. You’ll need to wind this one yourself, but it’s a serious bit of watchmaking priced at $5,000.
