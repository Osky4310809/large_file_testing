Apart from the N5bn, as revealed in the 2017 budget proposal before the National Assembly, the Army also plans to spend N846m on the repair of existing military equipment in the country as the fight against insurgency is expected to gain momentum in the coming year. Our correspondent, who obtained a copy of the budget proposal of the Ministry of Defence, the Nigerian Army, the Nigerian Navy and the Nigerian Air Force, at the National Assembly, observed that the total budget for the Army stands at N152bn. While the Army will have N152bn, the Nigerian Navy will be allocated N91bn, and the NAF will have N100bn. Our correspondent learnt that the capital expenditure for the Army stands at N20bn, while the rehabilitation and repair of weapons will cost N846,033,430.
