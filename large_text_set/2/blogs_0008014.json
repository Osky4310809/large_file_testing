The actress will be a part of Rajkumar Hirani’s upcoming biopic on Sanjay Dutt. Mumbai Mirror reported that the diva will be essaying the role of Nargis Dutt in the movie. Isn’t that cool? The last time we saw her on big screen, that too in a big movie was ages ago. With her tumultuous personal life and medical conditions, the diva went away from all the limelight. However, she is all set to make a comeback and that too, quite a bang on one! We hear she’ll be playing Sanju Baba’s mother in his biopic. \nThe same was confirmed by the director, who quoted, “Yes, Manisha is playing Nargisji. She’s a wonderful person, extremely sweet.” The big question remained though. Why did the director choose her? To this Hirani said, “We were thinking of many actresses. And while Manisha is really pretty and a fantastic actress, my primary reason for taking her is that she’s a cancer survivor and, having been through the journey herself, can identify with Nargisji’s fight with the Big C. When we met and she told me a little about her journey.” It’s going to be interesting to see that the diva will be playing Ranbir’s mother in the film. Koirala was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012 and after a relentless pursuit in New York, she was finally cured from the disease.

Find out ) \nThe cast of Dutt biopic is not a very conventional kind but we don’t expect Hirani to be a conventional director as well! He assembles a set of actors and conceptualises a brilliant act, which is what we’re expecting even from this movie. The ensemble cast comprises of Ranbir Kapoor as Dutt, Dia Mirza as his wife Maanyata, Sonam Kapoor as his earlier love interest, Vicky Kaushal as his friend from US, Anushka Sharma as a journalist and Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt. The reasons behind all his choices for the film are quite interesting. The shooting of the film kickstarted in January itself. It is slated to have a 2017 release so hopefully the schedules will be wrapped up soon. \nFor the same, RK Jr is undergoing a massive transformation in terms of body, to fit the bill. We all know how bulky Dutt is in terms of abs and muscles and Ranbir will have to build his body to match with the 57 year old’s rugged body. We’re super excited to see what the filmmaker has in store for us. In fact, with such an interesting ensemble cast, we’re all the more curious about the story of Dutt’s life.
