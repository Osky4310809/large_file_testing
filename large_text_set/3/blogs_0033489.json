Of all the 24 crayons in the Crayola box, Daywalt said he would have expected Red Violet to be the one to get the ax (“That’s like it’s kind of red and purple — it doesn’t really have a home”). Crayola hasn’t yet announced a replacement color, Daywalt’s vote is plaid, striped or rainbow, “the acceptance crayon.”\n\nDaywalt has quite a following in the crayon world. “A week doesn’t go by that I don’t get an art teacher or a teacher who has crayons in the classroom writing to say, ‘Thanks a lot, my crayons are naked now, they’ve torn off all their wrappers,” as happens to a crayon character in the story.\n“Every time I do a school visit, I get some really cool new crayon melted project, which in a way is kind of horrifying,” he says. “They give me crayons melted on paper and I’m like, ‘Oh God, their heads are melting!'” The best crayon-themed gift he’s received: a pea green, 3-ft.-long, knitted, stuffed crayon resembling his character Esteban the Magnificent. Daywalt toted him along on tour, including bringing him to airport bars.\nThough Daywalt says he hasn’t collaborated with Crayola, he has a great fondness for the company’s products: “They were my best friends when I was a little boy, and they helped me draw all my favorite Star Wars characters,” he says. “My goal was to make something that was as universally loved as the items it was about.”\nAsked whether he has any future crayon-themed projects in the pipeline, he demurs. “I’ll just say I’m not allowed to tell you.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:44:23.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
