A dancer carrying a fake wave accidentally hit the actor in the face while she was singing “How Far I’ll Go” from the movie. Cravalho barely flinched and continued to serenade the star-studded audience despite the snafu.\nAt just 16 years old Cravalho already seems to be a pro. She voiced the hero Moana in an animated Disney film. She performed the Oscar-nominated song with Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda , who wrote some of the film’s music. Miranda will earn the elusive EGOT title if “How Far I’ll Go” wins at the Oscars, winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:19:08.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
