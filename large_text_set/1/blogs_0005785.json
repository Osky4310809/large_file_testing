Nokia 6 with 5.5-inch full HD display, 4GB RAM and 16MP camera officially announced By January 8, 2017 “Nokia 6 is the first official Android-powered smartphone and it looks stunning” \nAfter months of rumours and speculations, Nokia’s first Android-powered smartphone is now finally official and it has been christened the Nokia 6. The Nokia 6 is an exclusive product for China unfortunately and Nokia’s reasoning for this decision is, “With over 552 million smartphone users in China in 2016, a figure that is predicted to grow to more than 593 million users by 2017, it is a strategically important market where premium design and quality is highly valued by consumers .” Nokia claims that “it takes 55 minutes to machine a single Nokia 6 from a solid block of 6000 series aluminium.” To jog your memory slightly, the 6000 series aluminium was also used in Apple’s iPhone 6, which was infamous for its bendgate issue. However, Nokia does promise a “high-level” of structural quality. The phone is only 7.85mm thick, excluding the protruding camera.( Related read: Leaked presentation slide reveals HMD Global will launch up to 7 Nokia Android phones this year ) The Nokia 6 has a 5.5-inch hybrid in-cell full HD display, which is protected by a layer of curved 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3. The display and the protection layer are further laminated together with a polariser layer – like the one used in sunglasses – which apparently offers better sunlight legibility. Nokia 6 packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 octa-core SoC and 4GB of RAM. It comes with 64GB of internal storage and support for microSD cards of up to 128GB storage capacity. It supports almost all the LTE bands, including Band 40. The Nokia 6 also includes a 3,000mAh battery, which – according to Nokia – offers a maximum standby time of 32 days, 3G talk time of 18 hours, and music playback time of 22 hours. As far as ports are concerned, the phone comes with a micro-USB port (USB 2.0 standard, which is disappointing) with support for USB OTG and a dedicated 3.5mm jack. The phone also comes with a smattering of sensors including a light sensor, proximity sensor, accelerometer (gravity sensor), electronic compass, gyroscope, front fingerprint sensor, and hall sensor. ( Related read: Nokia 150 is the first mobile phone launched by HMD Global ) There is a 16MP rear camera with an f/2 aperture and a 1µm sensor. The camera includes phase-detection autofocus (PDAF) and is supported by dual tone flash for low-light conditions. The front camera has an 8MP 1.12µm sensor with an f/2 aperture. There are two speakers on the top and the bottom edge of the Nokia 6, and the phone also supports the latest Dolby ATMOS standard. Arto Nummela, CEO, HMD Global spoke about the phone’s launch, “ The Nokia 6 is a result of listening to our consumers who desire a beautifully crafted handset with exceptional durability, entertainment and display features. Our ambition is to deliver a premium product, which meets consumer needs at every price point, in every market. We start today, with our premium, high quality Nokia 6; built to deliver a fantastic core user experience for Chinese consumers. We look forward to unveiling further products in the first half of this year.” The Nokia 6 will debut exclusively on JD.com in early 2017 and it is priced at 1699 CNY (approximately Rs 16,700). Are you as excited as we are about the Nokia 6? Or, are you disappointed that the phone is exclusive only to China?
