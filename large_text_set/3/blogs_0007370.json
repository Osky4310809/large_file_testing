I just figured maybe the banners would work themselves out and were just misplaced for the first few miles. As I got into the later miles and my watch was still beeping off the markers, it was clear that the distance was going to be short.\" \nIt was Montoya's first attempt at a marathon and with a finishing time of 2:37:03 he was the fourth overall finisher and would have easily qualified for the 2018 Boston Marathon. \n\"I was only planning on running one marathon a year and I wanted Boston to be next year's,\" Montoya said. \"Now it looks like I'll have to run another one to qualify for next year's (Boston Marathon).\" \nAs many of the runners feared, TWMM was unsuccessful in getting the Boston Athletic Association to accept adjusted times for qualification for the 2018 Boston Marathon. \nIn the letter, The Woodlands Marathon Race Director , William J. Fowlkes , apologized and took \"full responsibility\" for the mistake. \nFowlkes also said that those that used The Woodlands Marathon to qualify for the Boston Marathon, would have their finish time evaluated based on the BAA criteria and will be offered a discount. \nHe asked that runners send an email with the subject line reading, \"Boston Qualifier – Evaluation\" to admin@thewoodlandsmarathon.com. \nOnly runners that would have qualified based on TWMM's calculated overall pace will be considered for the discount and have until May 1, 2017 to request their time be evaluated. \nThose still hoping to compete in the 2018 Boston Marathon will have to qualify at another event. \n\"We know you have been patiently awaiting an announcement,\" Fowlkes said in the letter. \"And we hope the information we provided allows any time needed to meet their qualification standard at another event in the near future.\" \nMontoya has already picked out his next race — the Houston native, said he is looking at the Rock 'n' Roll San Diego Marathon in June as his next chance at qualifying for Boston. \n\"The only unfortunate thing about that is that I am going to have to take a trip to actually get that one in,\" Montoya said. \"I was glad that I was able to Run The Woodlands Marathon from home, basically.\" \nDespite the disappointment, Montoya is taking everything in stride wants to encourage his fellow runners to rise above this setback. \n\"Things like this happen and they really test your willingness to succeed at your goals,\" he said. \"Having been a runner for more than half of my life, I want to encourage all those runners that missed it, those people that had been training specifically for this, or if it's one of those things they want to cross off their bucket list, just hang in there.\" Subscribe to HCN \nFor more information on newspaper subscriptions and newspaper delivery, call (855) 460-6397 or email .
