But police negotiation techniques employed by the New York City Police Department’s Hostage Negotiations Team (HNT) in high-stakes, high-pressure crisis negotiation situations, outlined in an article from Jeff Thompson and Hugh McGowan, Ph.D., are critical for any negotiator faced with high-tension conflicts in business or diplomatic negotiations. \nThompson, a NYPD Detective, is a research scholar at Columbia University School of Law and a Ph.D. candidate at the Griffith University Law School in Queensland, Australia. McGowan is a former commanding officer of the NYPD’s Hostage Negotiation Team, having led the HNT for 13 years. The NYPD Hostage Negotiation Team handles more crisis negotiations in one month than most departments do in a year and, in 2012 alone, the department handled 400 such negotiations. In a previous year, one incident was well over 50 hours long and included a team of 17 crisis negotiators . \nCrisis negotiation skills can make or break a negotiator in heated conflicts.

Opening up avenues of communication to your counterpart signals that you are ready to listen, an integral first step to building rapport between negotiating counterparts by “build[ing] trust…as well as display[ing] empathy,” which can lead to further mutual gains at the bargaining table as the negotiation progresses beyond the initial stages. \nCrisis Negotiation Skills #2. Patience \nNot only is it important to allow your counterpart a forum to air concerns during a hostage negotiation, it is also critical for the crisis negotiator to be patient and “avoid jumping to conclusions and rushing quickly towards a resolution.” The patient negotiator seeks to build rapport so as to influence her counterpart’s actions; if she ignores this process, she greatly hinders her ability to influence her counterpart and resolve the situation in a peaceful manner. \nCrisis Negotiation Skills #3. Active Listening \nThe NYPD Hostage Negotiations Team calls “ active listening ” an affective and effective skill. Active listening is an affective skill when it is used to build trust and rapport between negotiating parties with the effective byproduct of this process resulting in information gathering, which can help maintain an open dialogue with your negotiating counterpart. \nCrisis Negotiation Skills #4. Respect \nActive listening and patience are high on the list of the NYPD HRT’s conflict resolution tactics . Both result in your counterpart feeling she is respected and that her concerns are being heard and addressed. \nCrisis Negotiation Skills #5. Calm \nDisplaying calm in the midst of a heated crisis negotiation is perhaps one of the most critical police negotiation techniques a hostage negotiator can master, because “the negotiator’s actions are contagious and . . . using a calm, understanding, and respectful tone is what helps the subject realize there is an alternative way out.” \nCrisis Negotiation Skills #6. Self-Awareness \nSelf awareness for the NYPD HNT involves the dual realization that the crisis negotiator must establish a relationship with a complete stranger while keeping her communication strategic and purposeful in nature. \nCrisis Negotiation Skills #7. Adaptability \nA police negotiation technique that all skilled negotiators should possess in their negotiation skills repertoire is the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and to respond to those circumstances in a way that preserves the relationship they have built with their counterpart while also bringing them closer to their negotiation goals. As the NYPD HNT points out, “crisis and hostage negotiation is not a ‘cookie-cutter’ design where the same approach and actions are used each time in an identical way,” and, indeed, no skilled negotiator would ever approach the bargaining table with this mindset. \nWhile negotiations are never uniform or universal, the relationship building and communication skills advocated by integrative bargainers do apply in nearly every negotiation scenario you can imagine. \nThough not often fraught with the emotional complexity of a hostage negotiation, business negotiations still rely upon trust, rapport, and a mutual sense of respect in order to make the deal happen. Likewise, when dealing with difficult people in your daily life, active listening and a respectful, calm demeanor are proven techniques for preserving your relationship with your counterpart while also addressing her concerns in a thoughtful way. \nCrisis negotiation skills can make or break a negotiator in heated conflicts.
