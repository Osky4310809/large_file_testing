The decision to \"pursue a new challenge\" was a tough one, she said, with moist eyes, because she loves the show, her staff, her colleagues at Fox News, and especially her viewers. She decided to make the switch, despite a reported Fox News offer of $20 million a year, because of the \"human connection\" she misses with her young children, she said. Her \"new adventure\" will involve \"joining the journalists at NBC News, who I deeply admire,\" Kelly said, but she wasn't burning bridges. Kelly said she is \"deeply thankful to Fox News,\" the Murdoch family, and her colleagues, whom she described as a \"second family.\" \nLike in all families, Kelly has had some spats with her colleagues, notably fellow nighttime anchors Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity , as well as former boss Roger Ailes . Presumably, Fox News has another person of Irish heritage ready to take her prime-time slot when Kelly steps down at the end of this week.

One guard was killed in the jailbreak and an inmate was wounded. \nAuthorities say they suspect the attack in the southern city was led a local Muslim rebel commander, The Guardian reports. Warden Peter John Bonggat told a local television station the goal was to \"rescue their comrades under our custody,\" and prisoners who were not part of their group took advantage of the situation and escaped. The dilapidated jail in a rural area housed 1,511 inmates, and didn't have enough guards, Bonggat said. The army and police are searching for the escaped prisoners, with local authorities reporting that up to six of them have been killed. Catherine Garcia Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images \nA senior U.S. intelligence official says there's at least one major error in Donald Trump's latest tweet aimed at the intelligence community. \nOn Tuesday night, Trump diluted his suspicions surrounding foreign interference with the presidential election into a 140-character message, tweeting : \"The 'intelligence' briefing on so-called 'Russian hacking' was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!\" The problem, the intelligence official told NBC News, is that reports stating Trump was to be briefed in New York City by the CIA, NSA, and FBI heads on Wednesday were false — the meeting was always scheduled for Friday. The tweet is not only \"disturbing\" and \"adversarial,\" the official told NBC News, but Trump is \"calling out the men and women of the intelligence community the way he called out Lockheed and Boeing , but these are public servants.\" \nTrump knows a thing or two about delays — on Dec. 12, he announced he was postponing until January a press conference slated for Dec. 15, where he was supposed to reveal his plans for dealing with conflicts of interest during his presidency (he will allegedly hold a \"general news conference\" next week). The country is also still waiting for an address from his wife, Melania, that was promised in August; Trump said at the time she would \"over the next couple of weeks\" discuss reports that she violated immigration laws when she first arrived in the United States (Melania did release a letter from her attorney on her Twitter page in September, but never spoke about the allegations). Catherine Garcia Drew Angerer/Getty Images \nOmarosa Manigault, best known for appearing multiple times on The Apprentice franchise and parlaying that exposure into more reality show gigs, will serve as public liaison in Donald Trump's White House, a transition official said. \nDuring the campaign, Manigault was Trump's Director of African-American Outreach, and she is now part of his transition team's executive committee. Manigault has worked in Washington before — she served in the office of Vice President Al Gore — but in recent years, she's become famous for her stints on the first season of The Apprentice (during which she was labeled a villain), its sequels The Celebrity Apprentice (where she feuded with Piers Morgan) and The Celebrity Apprentice: All Stars (this time she threatened to sue a \"demented\" La Toya Jackson), and The Surreal Life, Fear Factor , and Girls Behaving Badly . \nA transition official told ABC News Manigault actually wanted to be the ambassador to Haiti, as she has done missionary work in the country. Trump fired her in week nine of The Apprentice , week 10 of The Celebrity Apprentice , and week five of The Celebrity Apprentice: All Stars , so best wishes to Manigault this time around. Catherine Garcia \nThere are just 2 Shakers left in the United States January 3, 2017 \nWith the death of Sister Frances Carr, the number of Shakers living in the U.S. is down to two. One of the last remaining Shakers dies at 89, leaving just 2 https://t.co/Ps8zb8lss6 pic.twitter.com/xSGAwyJhK6 \n— Boston.com (@BostonDotCom) January 3, 2017 \nCarr, 89, died due to cancer Monday at the Shaker community of Sabbathday Lake in New Gloucester, Maine, surrounded by friends and her nieces. Before she died, Carr said she was hopeful more people would join the Shakers; remaining member Brother Arnold Hadd, 60, said some people have come to Sabbathday Lake in recent years, but they decided not to stay. \"Every day the prayers go up that we will get people to come, that we get competent vocations,\" he told The Associated Press . \"It's a calling from God.\" \nMembers of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming fled persecution in England, settling in upstate New York in 1747 (critics dubbed them the \"Shaking Quakers\" because of the way they worshiped at the time). They believe in pacifism, communal ownership, celibacy, and gender equality, and are credited with creating the flat-bottom broom and circular saw. Before the Civil War, there were more than 5,000 followers in 18 communities across 10 states, but the numbers gradually dwindled due to the celibacy of members and the decision to stop accepting orphans into the fold. Now, the only Shaker community is Sabbathday Lake, home to Hadd and 78-year-old Sister June Carpenter.
