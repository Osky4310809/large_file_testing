He also mentioned that some of the Democrats not attending have questioned the legitimacy of Trump’s election.\n“Do you think there’s a danger in saying that before he even takes office?” Geist asked Pelosi.\nPelosi did not directly answer the question, excusing challenges to Trump’s legitimacy because it was a point brought up by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.).\n“If it were anybody but John Lewis, it would be a different story,” Pelosi said.\n“Isn’t it more difficult now to work together when you’ve said flatly he’s not even a legitimate president?” Geist then asked.\nPelosi denied that lawmakers were questioning Trump’s legitimacy, which led Geist to remind her that Lewis had said the president-elect was “illegitimate,” in part because of Russian interference in the election.\n“You believe he’s a legitimate president?” Geist asked.\nPelosi again did not directly answer the question.\n“I remind you that Hillary Clinton got millions more votes,” Pelosi said. She also referenced the federal investigation of the hacks into Democratic political operatives and institutions during the election, which were reportedly carried out by forces linked to the Russian government.\n“It sounds like you don’t totally believe he’s a legitimate president,” Geist said.\nPelosi did say that Trump was elected by the Electoral College but would not directly state during the interview that Trump is a legitimate president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T17:01:35.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
