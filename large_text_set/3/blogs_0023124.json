Well, that kid got no fines or penalties for it. Instead, NASCAR served up penalties to drivers whose cars failed inspection.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nThe drivers who actually got fines from the weekend at Phoenix International Raceway were Brad Keselowski and, oddly enough, Harvick. Both drivers’ race finishes in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series’ Camping World 500, fifth for Keselowski and sixth for Harvick, are now labeled as “encumbered” by NASCAR. That means they won’t get any playoff points for the finishes. \nKeselowski’s race car failed post-race inspection in Phoenix for its suspension having too much rear steer, and the resulting penalties from NASCAR are the encumbered finish, a $65,000 fine and three-race suspension to his crew chief, and the loss of 35 driver points and 35 owner points in the championship.\nAdvertisement \n\nThe Harvick car was the random selection to go to the NASCAR research and development center after the race, and that team got the hammer put on them when NASCAR found an unapproved track bar assembly. Harvick’s crew chief will pay $25,000 and miss a race, and his Stewart-Haas Racing team will lose 10 owner points and 10 driver points. \n\nMeanwhile, Harvick’s favorite kid who ran another driver into a wall on purpose is doing just fine. No penalties there, no siree! \nThe driver whom NASCAR let completely off the hook was Austin Dillon, who intentionally wrecked Xfinity Series regular Cole Custer under caution after Custer caused him to spin with 11 laps to go in the Xfinity race on Saturday. Dillon, a Cup Series regular, slowed under caution and put Custer in the wall after the spin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:13:00.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
