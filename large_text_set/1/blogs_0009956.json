TRAI’s speed test data shows Reliance Jio 4G speeds are fastest among five telcos By - January 12, 2017 “Speed test data for December 2016 shows Jio topping the charts with average download speeds of 9.9Mbps” \nIn October last year, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) published speed test data of all the telecom operators in the country. The data showed that the 4G speeds on the newcomer telco Reliance Jio’s network was slower as compared to the top five telcos in the country. Now TRAI has published speed test data for the December 2016 month, which shows that Jio was the fastest 4G speed provider in the country. \nTRAI’s speed test results sourced via its MySpeed app show that Jio’s 4G speeds have dramatically improved over the period up to December 2016. The data shows Jio’s 4G download speeds average at 9.9Mbps, higher than Airtel and Vodafone’s 4G speed of 8.1Mbps and 7.5Mbps respectively. However, when it comes to the upload speeds, Reliance Jio ranks below the top 3 telcos – Airtel (3.3Mbps), Vodafone (4.1Mbps), and Idea (3.9Mbps) – with an average speed of 2.6Mbps. \nAs far as the other telcos are concerned, the data shows Idea’s 4G speed sits at 6.8Mbps, RCom’s at 5.7Mbps, Telenor’s at 5.3Mbps, Cellone’s at 4.8Mbps, and Aircel’s the lowest at 0.9Mbps.TRAI has also revealed that Jio 4G had the highest number of new users in October last year. \nOur latest speed test of Jio’s network at the time of writing this news in Gurgaon showed the download speed of 14.61Mbps in one test and a whopping 34.42Mbps in another. The tests show a maximum upload speed of 7.12Mbps. To compare, the same test on Airtel’s network resulted in a download speed of 10.22Mbps and upload speed of 6.38Mbps.
