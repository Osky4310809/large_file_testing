The praised film was nominated for Best Visual Effects alongside other geek-friendly titles like Rogue One: A Star Wars Story . However, the ultimate prize wound up going to The Jungle Book instead. \nOf course, many are not too surprised by the turnout. At this year’s BAFTA Awards, The Jungle Book swept the event for its Visual Effects prize. However, there were plenty of fans hoping Doctor Strange or Star Wars might edge the live-action Disney film out. The Jungle Book wowed fans around the world with its stunning CG reimagining of an entire jungle with animals and more. \nDoctor Strange ’s visuals were nothing to sneeze at either. The mind-bending film was commended for its creative effects as characters like the Ancient One quite literally turned cities upside-down. The film’s final sequence in Hong Kong was a visual masterpiece, and Marvel fans were pleased with its complexity. \nAnd, as always, Star Wars stunned audiences with its intricate visuals. The film brought original trilogy battles to new heights as its creators combined digital and practical effects to blow fans away. It also didn’t hurt that director Gareth Edwards was able to snag unused footage from the first films to tidy up for the franchise’s first solo venture. \nYou can read up on the category’s full list of nominees below: \nDeepwater Horizon Kubo and the Two Strings Doctor Strange Rogue One: A Star Wars Story The Jungle Book \nYou can also watch a highlight reel of the movies and their stunning visual effects here thanks to intrepid fans with admirable editing skills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:58:26.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
