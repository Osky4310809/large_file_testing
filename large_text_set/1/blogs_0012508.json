Assembling Granny Squares You should now have 4 completed granny squares in your desired size.Arrange 3 granny squares so that they are laying side by side in a horizontal line. Sew the edges of these 3 squares together.Place the 4th square directly above the center square and sew one edge together. (Refer to photo 1 of the tutorial for a visual.)Fold one of the outside squares toward the center so its top edge meets the side edge of the 4th square you placed. Repeat for the other side. (Refer to photo 2 of the tutorial.)Weave in all ends and proceed to the bonnet edging instructions. Baby Bonnet Edging Attach yarn to one corner of bonnet. (Refer to photo 3 of the tutorial.) Rnd 1: Ch 1, 27 (37) sc evenly spaced across one long edge (the length of 3 squares), 2 sc in corner, 27 (37) sc evenly spaced along next long edge, 1 sc in corner (same sp as you attached yarn), sl st to beginning ch -- 58 (78) sc.
