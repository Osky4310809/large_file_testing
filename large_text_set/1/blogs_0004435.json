Clapper: RT reporting on US problems part of 'multifaceted' Russian campaign to undermine elections By 0 23 \nRT’s reporting on US issues was part of a “multifaceted Russian campaign” to undermine America, according to the outgoing Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. \n“RT was very active in promoting a particular point of view, disparaging our system, our alleged hypocrisy about human rights, etc. Whatever crack, fissure they could find in our tapestry, they would exploit it,” Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, at a hearing about cybersecurity challenges. Gee the Russians fund RT & have their own point of view regarding USA Human Rights – how terrible of them! DNI Clapper \n— David Prescott (@prescottgolf014) January 5, 2017 \nIn addition to hacking, Russia used fake news, social media and RT to influence the recent US elections, Clapper argued. Though the US intelligence community has not been able to gauge the actual impact of any of these action, “the totality of that effort, not only as DNI but as a citizen, I think is a grave concern,” he said. \nEarlier in the hearing, committee chairman John McCain (R-Arizona) asked whether Russian interference in the election would qualify as an act of war. \n“They did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort. We have no way of gauging any impact it had on the choices the electorate made,” Clapper responded. “Whether or not that constitutes an act of war is a very heavy policy call I don’t believe the intelligence community should make.” \nFlanked by NSA chief Admiral Mike Rogers and the Pentagon’s Undersecretary for Intelligence Marcel Lettre, Clapper agreed with outraged Democratic Senators that President-Elect Donald Trump was unfairly disparaging the intelligence community. \n“I think there is an important distinction between healthy skepticism that policymakers, including the first policymaker, should always have toward intelligence… and disparagement,” he told Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri). \nThe DNI also took a shot at WikiLeaks cofounder Julian Assange, describing him as “holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London because he’s under indictment by the Swedish government for a sexual crime.” \nAssange’s publication of US documents put the lives of US spies and military at risk, Clapper argued. “I don’t think those of us in the intelligence community have a whole lot of respect for him.” \nPresident Barack Obama received a classified briefing about the reported Russian involvement in the election on Thursday morning, AP reported. He had asked US intelligence agencies to conduct a full review of “Russian hacking” last month, asking that it be completed before he leaves office on January 20. An unclassified version of that report will be released to the public “early next week,” Clapper told Congress. \nVia RT .
