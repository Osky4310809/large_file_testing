King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 14 hours ago 0 \nDiscussing the latest Linkin Park single \" Heavy ,\" Chester Bennington said constant changes is what the band is all about, pointing out that divisive fan reactions are something the boys are more than familiar with. \nThe singer told Q104.3 : \"What's wrong with [writing a pop song]?! With us, it doesn't seem to matter what kind of song we write, whether it's a pop song or a mid-tempo alternative song or a hip-hop track or a screamer. We get the same polarizing response from our fanbase every single time. \n\"It's just been this way for us since the beginning. I remember when we released ' Hybrid Theory ' [in October 2000], it got like two stars in Rolling Stone . No one wanted to sign us to any deal, no one knew how to push the record and one article written by a guy in Seattle said I was responsible for every horrible thing that's happened to humankind. \n\"It's the nature of the beast to have people who love stuff and people who don't love it and that's OK, but it doesn't matter. What matters is whether or not we love it.\" \nChester concluded: \"The last thing we wanna do is be caricatures of ourselves. We wanna keep evolving. Our creative journey is a journey, it's not a destination, a place to be and stay. It's a place to visit and then move on. I think that's one of the reasons why here we are 18 years later making a record we never made before.\"Linkin Park are set to release their seventh studio album \"One More Light\" on May 19 via Warner Bros.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:15:27.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
