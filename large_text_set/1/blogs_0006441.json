Maybe it’s because the average fan can’t spell or pronounce his name, or maybe it’s because he plays in Milwaukee, which I’m told is Algonquin for “the good land, just not for basketball.” Regardless, the man on the latest cover of Sports Illustrated , a guy fans lovingly refer to as the Greek Freak, should have 100 percent of the All-Star vote, or he should at least be a surefire starter for the East, as he is proving night after night that the future of the Milwaukee Bucks is strong .\nHis insane talent and all-around dominance was once again on display on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden, as he dropped 27 points and grabbed 13 boards en route to the Bucks pulling off a thrilling 105-104 win at the buzzer. Oh, and the game-winner? Antetokounmpo, naturally, with a spectacular step-back shot that left New York’s fans speechless and presumably seething. \nExcept, of course, for the Greek fans who came to see their superstar dominate. \nGiannis Antetokounmpo leaves the team bus to greet the Greek fans chanting his name outside The Garden!! #NBAVote pic.twitter.com/20ITvBrwvA \n— Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) January 5, 2017 \n\n\nThat crowd’s still not big enough, but hopefully it will be soon enough after more opposing fans change their jerseys . Still, Antetokounmpo’s “Wow” at the end is the perfect reaction for a guy on the verge of being a household name (even if it is tough to pronounce). Bucks fans should probably be a little concerned over the big city reaction, but they should just sit back and enjoy it for now.\nAlso, in case you’re looking to join the crowd when Antetokounmpo comes to your town, please keep in mind that there is one thing he will not autograph.\nThey asked @Giannis_An34 to sign the Greek flag and he said \"No i don't put signatures on the flag\". Respect Giannis Antetokounmpo #NBAVote https://t.co/cLcyd8ekfC \n— Alexandros Maragos (@AlexMaragos) January 5, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T18:22:30.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
