One look at her Snapchat and you’ll know what I’m talking about. She has never shied away from talking about her heritage or about issues us women face, and did I mention that I love how real she is? Anyway… I woke up this morning to find a photo that Masaba shared on her Instagram, where she talks about her struggle with acne. I connected with it instantly and I know that every woman out there will too, because how often have we been judged for our bodies or for having acne? It’s not easy to put up a picture yourself like this for the world to see, but she did, and it’s really inspiring. \nRead what she had to say. A post shared by Masabs (@masabagupta) on Mar 9, 2017 at 8:40pm PST \nYup, “collect your scars & build them into something beautiful”… Remember that, always. More power to you, Masaba. <3 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T11:57:26.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
