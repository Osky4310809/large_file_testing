The Cleveland Browns currently hold that pick, but Garrett recently made a video hoping the Cowboys would trade up and take him .\nIf Garrett doesn’t want to be the Browns No. 1 pick, defensive end prospect Takkarist McKinley has a suggestion for who the Browns should take instead.\nTakkarist McKinley.\nShit if he don't wanna go to #1 to the @Browns make Takkarist Mckinley the number 1 pick then https://t.co/F3ikxKKWBy \n— Takkarist McKinley (@TakkMckinley) February 11, 2017 If the Browns value talking in third person on their draft evaluation, then McKinley might just be in the No. 1 pick running. If not, he’s more likely to go in the late first round or sometime in the second round. SB Nation’s Dan Kadar has McKinley going with the No. 29 pick in his latest mock draft . \nHey, you can’t blame the guy for trying.
