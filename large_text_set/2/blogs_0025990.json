The company’s solution revolves around an AI chatbot designed to assist employees in doing their jobs. Retailers participating in the Nexshop Training program are able to receive advice via either text or voice and can use the AI chatbot to find out the latest information about all of the new products and promotions in the store, Samsung’s IT division revealed. \nApart from the training system, Nexshop ships with two other platforms – a marketing system and a sales assistance system. Like its name suggests, the Nexshop marketing system was designed to generate marketing strategies by observing customers in stores, i.e. watching how they’re behaving and what they’re buying. On the other hand, the Nexshop sales assistance system was intended for inventory management and logistics as it provides in-depth insight into sales history and inventory. Apart from this trio of services, Samsung SDS also arrived at the latest iteration of MWC to showcase a biometric authentication tool for businesses based on its existing Nexsign technology. The service now boasts support for interactive voice recognition and fingerprint sensors and can work on numerous platforms including desktop computers and mobile devices, i.e. smartphones and tablets. Samsung SDS believes that its latest solution will prove to be a tremendous asset to a number of industries, particularly the online banking sector. More details on the solutions the company showcased at MWC 2017 are expected to follow soon. \nSamsung SDS’ AI-oriented product portfolio that was demonstrated earlier this week in Barcelona is yet another indication of the firm’s commitment to AI solutions. The largest business conglomerate in South Korea is currently rumored to be working on Bixby , a mobile AI assistant that’s reportedly slated to debut on the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus. Furthermore, recent reports suggest that the Seoul-based tech giant is also developing a competitor to Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Home smart speaker that’s allegedly called Samsung Hello . More details on the company’s AI-related ambitions are bound to be revealed in the near future, probably no later than March 29 when the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus will be unveiled.
