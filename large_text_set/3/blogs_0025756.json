Bad results for the team in the Champions League and the Serie A, coupled with an apparent bad relationship with egotistical club chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis made Koulibaly's representative claim loud and clear that it would be hard for his client to stay at the club next season. However, in a complete turnaround, Satin practically retracted everything he said earlier this month in an interview on Radio CRC. \"We renewed with Napoli until 2021, so Kalidou will stay at Napoli. He will not move from Napoli, everything is in order with the club.\" \"A release clause? There is no clause. These are private and confidential matters between the club and the player.\" -Bruno Satin; Source: Radio CRC via Europa Calcio If we hadn’t already done so, it is time to take Koulibaly off of Chelsea's transfer shortlist. At least until the next month or so, when the agent or Koulibaly himself goes back to their \"doubtful\" stance. Transfer rumors are fun, right?!
