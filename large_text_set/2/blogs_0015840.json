James Earl Jones back as Mufasa of 'Lion King' Fans just can't wait for the actor with the booming voice to return to Pride Rock in the upcoming remake. @gaelFC \n\"Lion King\" fans are looking forward to James Earl Jones being king -- again. \nThe 86-year-old actor, who provided the deep voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars series as well as of Simba's regal father Mufasa in the 1994 Disney movie \" The Lion King ,\" is returning to Pride Rock. \nOn Friday, Jon Favreau, who's directing the planned \"Lion King\" remake, sent out a tweet that had fans roaring with delight. \nThough delight turned to dread for some when they remembered Mufasa's fate. \nFavreau also dropped another casting bomb on Friday: the casting of Donald Glover as Mufasa's son Simba, the film's namesake. \nFans seemed to like that casting choice, too. \nSome were confused because the new film (no release date yet) is being talked up as a live-action film. \nBut as The Hollywood Reporter explains , the remake will be similar to Favreau's version of \"The Jungle Book,\" which featured a child actor but brought the animals to life with computer technology. \nThe remake has no release date yet, but hakuna matata , it's on the way. \nIt's Complicated : This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter. \nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team reminds us why tech is cool.
