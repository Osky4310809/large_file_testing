Riley’s addition to the Young Money APAA Sports & Entertainment agency was announced Monday and the celebration of the deal was posted via Instagram. \nRiley, 22, is a native of Buras, LA, and was a standout defensive high school football player in the state. In four years as an LSU Tiger, Riley worked his way up from a reserve and special teams player to starting at linebacker during his senior year. The team just concluded its season by beating the Lousiville Cardinals 29-9 in the Citrus Bowl last week. \nBoth Riley and Lil Wayne posted photos of the signing to their respective Instagram pages. Riley was a bit more eloquent in his caption of a group photo that featured Wayne, Mack Maine, Cortez Bryant and others from the Young Money APAA family. \n“Happy to be apart of the #YMAPAA Family.. We’ve all been doubted throughout our life, and we’ll continue to prove “all” wrong.. #Family #Love #Loyalty #Trust Only way is Up from here!” wrote Riley in his photo caption. \nWayne added a succinct, “Welkome to the family @d_riley40!! #YMAPAA” — and yes, note the lack of the letter “c” in this posting. \nCheck out the photos below.
