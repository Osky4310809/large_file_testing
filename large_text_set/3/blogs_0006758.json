The guide covers 44 cities in 20 European countries, including major dining destinations like Paris and Berlin (where stars have already been announced in country-specific guides) as well as smaller cities in Europe. This year, the list includes a total of 2,332 recommended restaurants, with just one new addition to the list of 20 three-Michelin-starred restaurants: Lasarte , chef Martín Berasategui ’s recently revamped Barcelona restaurant. There are now 91 two-Michelin-starred restaurants on the list, with 12 added this year from eight different countries, including Amador , a Vienna restaurant that Rebecca Burr, head of the Michelin Guide Main Cities of Europe 2017, notes for its setting “within an elegant vaulted stone cellar.” The guide awarded 51 new restaurants one star, bringing that total to 386. The Main Cities of Europe guide also includes 50 new Bib Gourmand restaurants — a grouping that awards “good quality, good value cooking” — bringing the total number of recommended restaurants without stars to 311. Michael Ellis, International Director in charge of the Michelin Guides, says that the entire 2017 list “reflects the vibrancy and diversity of the culinary scene in Europe’s major cities.” Below, the full list of stars and the press release:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:28:52.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
