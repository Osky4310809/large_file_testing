I just prefer the latter's defense and court vision. \n15 Oklahoma City Thunder: Russell Westbrook, Steven Adams, Victor Oladipo \nAs we get into the top half of the list, we'll run into a number of teams led by superstars with decent but not stellar supporting casts. \nI'm not saying that includes the Thunder, necessarily, because I don't want Steven Adams to hurt me. He's an outstanding young basketball player, and Victor Oladipo has a certain amount of upside, too. \n... but that definitely includes the Thunder. 14 Miami Heat: Hassan Whiteside, Goran Dragic, James Johnson \nJust how good are the Heat? As our own Colin Cowherd pointed out this week, the Cavaliers might be better off without the one seed in the Eastern Conference if it means avoiding a first-round matchup with Miami. 13 Memphis Grizzlies: Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Vince Carter \nHere's hoping the 40-year-old Carter is still dunking on people into the next decade — and that Conley and Gasol eventually get the credit they deserve as two of the NBA's best players at their positions. 12 Portland Trail Blazers: Damian Lillard, C.J. McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic \nAs long as Nurkic keeps playing like he wants revenge against the Denver Nuggets for trading him, the Blazers are going to be ridiculously hard to beat, both for the remainder of this regular season and in the playoffs. 11 Milwaukee Bucks: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Jabari Parker \nThanks to various unfortunate injuries, there are no pictures in our database of Milwaukee's Big Three on the court together. Greg Monroe will have to suffice as a placeholder in the meantime, which seems fitting given the way the Bucks have used the big man this season. Derick E. Hingle Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports 10 New Orleans Pelicans: Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Jrue Holiday \nThe Pelicans are undeniably talented. They're also rather top-heavy, and they still have to figure out how to make the whole \"Boogie and the Brow\" experiment work. \nI'm keeping the faith for now, though, because those two All-Stars are just so good. 9 Washington Wizards: John Wall, Bradley Beal, Otto Porter Jr. \nThe Wizards probably aren't championship material, but they have a fine young trio to build around, complemented by the likes of Marcin Gortat and Markieff Morris. No wonder Washington clinched its first division championship in nearly four decades on Tuesday night. Bill Streicher Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports 8 Houston Rockets: James Harden, Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza \nYou could swap Beverley and Ariza for Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon if you really love 3-pointers more than anything in basketball. \nI'm taking the two guys who hold Houston's surprisingly solid defense together, though, because someone has to try to get stops for the Rockets. Brad Penner Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports 7 Toronto Raptors: Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, Serge Ibaka \nIbaka and P.J. Tucker were just the pieces the Raptors needed at the trade deadline, while DeRozan silenced any lingering doubters (guilty!) with his strong play all season long. \nAs for Lowry? His lingering health concerns are the only potential obstacle to Toronto giving the Cavs everything they can handle in the playoffs. Chris Nicoll-USA TODAY Sports Chris Nicoll 6 Utah Jazz: Rudy Gobert, Gordon Hayward, George Hill \nNo player in the NBA has a bigger disparity between his box-score numbers and his actual in-game impact than Gobert. The scary thing for the other 29 teams? He's only going to get better. \nAnd to Jazz fans yelling at me about Derrick Favors, Joe Ingles, or anyone else on this roster: I love your team. They're my Western Conference sleeper pick. Please stop yelling. Soobum Im Soobum Im-USA TODAY Sports 5 San Antonio Spurs: Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Pau Gasol \nAfter conferring with multiple Spurs fans and crunching the numbers, I chose Gasol over Danny Green and Patty Mills as the third member of San Antonio's Big Three. Honestly, though? I wanted to go with Pop. \nI should have. 4 Boston Celtics: Isaiah Thomas, Al Horford, Marcus Smart \nSome of the more basic advanced stats (talk about an oxymoron) paint Jae Crowder as Boston's third-best player, and maybe that's true. A very smart person who makes a significant amount of money wagering on the NBA and in other analytics-based fields convinced me that Smart is one of the best young players in the Association, though, so I'm rolling with him. 3 Los Angeles Clippers: Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan \nThe Clips' Big Three is the reason I picked Los Angeles as the team with the best chances to win the title if both the Warriors and Cavaliers should falter. The question is whether they'll still be together after this season. 2 Cleveland Cavaliers: LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love \nYou may yell at me @AndrewLynch on Twitter, Cavs fans. \nSeriously, as great as LeBron is, I can't rank Cleveland's Big Three over Golden State — not until a championship hangs in the balance, anyway. NBAE/Getty Images Andrew D. Bernstein 1 Golden State Warriors: Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green \nSorry, Klay. You're great and everything, but without Draymond, the Warriors wouldn't stand a chance as title contenders. He's not the best Golden State player. He's just the most important.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:16:53.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
