Sir Richard Branson has made similar proposals to send holidaymakers on sub-orbital flights in his Virgin Galactic venture. \nMany people are fascinated about the possibility of being able to travel to space and BBC audiences have been asking when will they be able to holiday beyond the stratosphere. \nLibby Jackson, who is Human Spaceflight and Microgravity Programme Manager at the UK Space Agency, said there could be developments in as little as three years' time. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Astronaut Tim Peake spent six months in orbit around the Earth on board the International Space Station \nMs Jackson, who was involved in supporting Tim Peake's flight to the International Space Station in 2015-16, said the UK government wants to gain a greater share of the commercial spaceflight market, by developing competitive, commercial and safe flight proposals for UK-based satellite launch services and sub-orbital flights. \n\"The UK Space Agency is facilitating this through grants to help develop the capability and legislation, with the first spaceport in the UK planned to be operational by 2020,\" she explained. \n\"A number of companies around the world are already taking bookings for their sub-orbital flights and expect to take fare-paying passengers into space in the coming years,\" she added. Why we wrote this article: \nWe asked readers to send Libby Jackson their questions on the potential of space tourism. \nOrville Eastland was one of many who asked: \"If this venture is successful, will space travel become available for more people to try?\" \nMr Eastland said he wanted to know more because he has always been really interested in anything to do with the cosmos and added: \"I would love to take a trip into space even if it is expensive!\" Affordable to all? \nIn time it is expected that the cost of space travel will eventually come down and become something which is affordable to more than only the very wealthy. \n\"The age of space tourism has been incubating for many years now, ever since Scaled Composites won the X-prize in 2004,\" said Ms Jackson. \n\"Space X is a commercial company and as the sector develops prices will eventually drop, just as aeroplane travel evolved from the early days of expensive flights to the modern era of budget airlines.\" \nYou might also like:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T05:32:01.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
