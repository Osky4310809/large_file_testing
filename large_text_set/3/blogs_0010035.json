The spot also gives fans a glimpse of the turning point for Belle (Emma Watson) when she asks Beast (Dan Stevens) if there's any way to break the curse. It's worth it alone though to see Cogsworth defend himself with a sword, which for some reason brings to mind the \"Farfegnugen\" screamed by Niles Crane on Fraiser...not really sure why. \nIn the \"Cursed\" spot, fans get a better look at the prince's transformation into the Beast, and what the servants at the castle looked like before their transformations. You can also see a quick snippet of the final confrontation between Beast and Gaston. \nFinally, in the \"Even Better Than The Original\" spot, you can see a bit more of the anticipated \"Be Our Guest\" musical number and a few more scenes between Beast and Belle. \nHit the next slides to see the \"Cursed\" and \"Better Than The Original\" spots, and make sure to rate the film in ComicBook.com's anticipation rankings ! \nBeauty and the Beast is the fantastic journey of Belle, a bright, beautiful and independent young woman who is taken prisoner by a beast in his castle. Despite her fears, she befriends the castle’s enchanted staff and learns to look beyond the Beast’s hideous exterior and realize the kind heart and soul of the true Prince within. \nBeauty and the Beast stars Emma Watson as Belle; Dan Stevens as the Beast; Luke Evans as Gaston, the handsome, but shallow villager who woos Belle; Oscar winner Kevin Kline as Maurice, Belles eccentric, but lovable father; Josh Gad as Lefou, Gaston’s long-suffering aide-de-camp; Golden Globe nominee Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, the candelabra; Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza, the harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette, the feather duster; six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe, the wardrobe; Oscar nominee Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, the mantel clock; and two-time Academy Award winner Emma Thompson as the teapot, Mrs. Potts \nBeauty and the Beast will be released in U.S. theaters on March 17, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T02:16:59.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
