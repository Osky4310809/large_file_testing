Besides being the fiercely unapologetic weirdo she is, the actresses is also our unsung style icon . Most notably, as of late, because of the ridiculously low-key little black dress she wore during her Saturday night performance on SNL . Although she wore Chanel jewelry and Christian Louboutin shoes, the actress wore a Spanx slip under her mesh YVY skirt. Yes, Spanx, as in THE Spanx. Stewart wore a Thinstincts Convertible Slip, a simple black number that let the rest of her outfit take center stage, literally.\nNBC/Getty At a whopping $78, the little black, or nude, dress can be worn in a myriad of ways thanks to its convertible straps. So, you can choose to wear it halter, racerback, criss cross or criss cross racerback. Spanx \nThinstincts Convertible Slip, $78, Spanx \nAnd although we love Stewart’s style, we can’t necessarily say we’re surprised that she managed to kill the high-low game so well. After all, if we had to guess a celebrity who would be into wearing Chanel with Spanx, it would definitely be Stewart, our favorite grounded, grungy style star. By pairing the simple black slip with a paneled mesh skirt, sheer socks and classic pumps, Stewart really owns her femme fatale look. Topped off with slightly disheveled, slicked back hair, a smoky eye and nude lips, Stewart really did look stunning…even when she accidentally dropped the F bomb.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:43:33.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
