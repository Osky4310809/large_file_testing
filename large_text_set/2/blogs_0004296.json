Single men can get in for a modest $1,850, or $1,500 if they’re with a lady. Women can get in free of charge, though they must send in full-body photographs of themselves to be approved for that privilege. Like any classy affair, men must show up in tuxedos. Unlike other classy affairs, women can get in by wearing lingerie alone. \nLawner, who is a 45-year-old divorced father of two, says he and his 20 employees refrain from having sex at the parties, though he does like to watch. Unfortunately for the rest of us who “just like to watch,” footage of the play parties isn’t easy to come by. All guests are required to check their cell phones at the door. But if we’re patient enough, we might get a glimpse down the road. Lawner says he’s in talks with Showtime to do an 8-party documentary on the club. Until then, we’ll just have to let our imaginations run wild.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:50:50.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
