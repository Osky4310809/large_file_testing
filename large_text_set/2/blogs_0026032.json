After a trip to Thailand, we discovered the reality of the struggle that most elephants actually face daily. We came back on a mission to find a way to help raise awareness and cultivate action. In order to get the spread and scale a large impact, the product would have to be fun and mass-market friendly. While on the same trip to Thailand, we discovered a popular style of bohemian pants that were the most comfortable pants we had ever worn. These glorious pants were a perfect vehicle for our mission. Why They Want to Save the Elephants A post shared by The Elephant Pants® (@theelephantpants) on Jan 24, 2017 at 4:25pm PST \nElephants are extremely intelligent and emotional animals. They live in family units and even mourn when family members pass away. It’s a shame that they are killed for their ivory just to supply collectibles or supposed medicines. Our philosophy is that the only one who needs ivory is an elephant, and with that we do our best to give elephants a voice. Their ‘Tank’ Appearance A post shared by The Elephant Pants® (@theelephantpants) on Feb 24, 2017 at 6:03am PST \nA few months after starting the business, we turned to each other and said, “We are going to be on Shark Tank .” We decided that we wanted to be a household name. Shortly after, we started the application process and submitted our first video. We made it through the first round, but we weren’t selected to participate in that season. Thankfully, the producers called us a few months after that to see if we were interested in applying again. We put together a really fun video the second time around and the rest is history.

Partnership With the International Elephant Foundation A post shared by The Elephant Pants® (@theelephantpants) on Dec 23, 2016 at 9:23am PST \nAs a partner with the International Elephant Foundation, we donate a portion of every sale to help create a sustainable future where elephants thrive. Through global projects focusing on wildlife/habitat protection, reducing human-elephant conflict, and advancing knowledge to cure elephant diseases, IEF is on the ground wherever there are elephants. While each region poses its own unique challenges, they all require the same thing- humans working together. Since its inception, IEF has supported over 120 annual and long-term projects focused on the fight to save elephants, and we’re extremely proud to contribute to their mission and help raise awareness. Plans for the Future A post shared by The Elephant Pants® (@theelephantpants) on Dec 22, 2016 at 5:20pm PST \nWe’re really excited for all the things that will come from being on Shark Tank and the notoriety it brings. We have plans to expand much more into wholesale and bigger retailers as well as international markets. We’re always innovating and coming out with new products, and the influx of customers and demand will allow us to develop and bring new products to market much quicker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:39:12.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
