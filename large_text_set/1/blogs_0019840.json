Leave Barron out of it! Image copyright AFP \nAs a public office holder the President of the United States could be considered fair game for criticism and mockery on social media. But should people draw a line when it comes to their children? \nDonald Trump's son, Barron, has been the target for some on social media, but others have come to his defence saying the ten-year-old is \"off limits\". \nAt the heart of the online decry is NBC's Saturday Night Live's writer Katie Rich, who posted a now-deleted tweet in which she said that \"Barron will be this country's first homeschool shooter\". \nThe anger was swift, with some even amongst the show's \"loyal viewers\" demanding her dismissal and urging a boycott of the programme. \nA Facebook post announcing that \"NO child deserves to be talked to in such a manner,\" has captured the hearts and minds of many. \nThe post which criticised those who \"go on and on about peace, hope and love, and yet spew hatred out the other side of your hypocritical mouth,\" has been shared over a million times. \nThe sentiment was similar on Twitter where many users expressed their shock at how \"cruel\" some people can be. \nChelsea Clinton, a former first child, joined the support for Barron, but maintained that \"Standing up for every kid also means opposing @POTUS policies that hurt kids.\" \nReports also suggest the backlash has propelled Miss Rich to delete her Twitter account. Toast can cause cancer... really? \nWhat did you have for breakfast this morning? If it was toast, or more specifically well done toast read on ... and no we're not making this up nor trying to \"scare\" you as some people have suggested. \nBut one story capturing your attention today is whether browned toast and potatoes are a potential cancer risk. \nSceptics amongst you have suggested that this story is just a distraction from the Syria peace talks, the trident missile story or the NHS crisis. It's not. \nThanks as well to Dave who explained this is \"just information for you to act or not act upon\". \nAnd we are really sorry sir that \"another avenue of pleasure closed\", it's not, you can still go for a gold - toast that is. \nAnd finally, as one twitter user points out there are other potential causes of cancer to worry about . \nSo no need to panic and reach for the cereal, just don't burn the toast.
