His sergeant recommended he buy a Rolex, because it was a great watch, and he ended up purchasing a GMT Master Model Rolex and kept the box and the receipt. \nThe watch cost him a month’s salary ($120) back in 1960 when he bought it. Curious of what it might be worth today, he brought it to the Antique Roadshow in Tucson, where Peter Planes appraised the watch. The man learns that not only is the Rolex that he purchased a rare one, but because he had kept the original sales receipt and saved the box, the value of the collectible watch was doubled! \nNeedless to say, when the man hears how much his watch is worth, he’s rendered completely speechless. \nIf you enjoyed this reveal, you’ll love this one appraising a Navajo blanket .
