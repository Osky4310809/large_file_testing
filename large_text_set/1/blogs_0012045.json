What might that world look like? \nBergeron’s answer, displayed in a series of striking color images, is eye-opening. Take a look: \nBergeron says she was inspired to make the project after she was confronted with some staggering numbers: Each of the millions of domesticated camels in the world eats about 8 pounds of food per day. That costs money—real money that could be spent on nutritious acacia leaves and shoots for giraffes. \nBergeron remembers experiencing a sudden revelation: “Why did things need to be that way? What if we acted now? What kind of difference would it make if all the resources devoted to feeding camels were redirected entirely toward giraffes?” \nHer art confronts us with a choice. Will we continue feeding giraffes and camels the amounts of food we do now, or will we seize the moment, stop focusing so much on camel food, and start feeding giraffes much more food? \nThe message is loud and clear. It’s up to us to heed it. \nUPDATE: The internet is already responding. In the video below, someone used Bergeron’s art to shine a light on a possible not-so-distant future, one within our reach.
