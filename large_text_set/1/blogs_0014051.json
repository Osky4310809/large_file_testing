On Monday, Joel and Giannis squared off in Milwaukee, and The Process got the better of the meeting. \nEmbiid had 22 points and a few more thunderous dunks against the Milwaukee Bucks in a 113-104 road win on Monday night. Here’s a another look at his best of the night, in case you want an under the hoop look at it. \n\nThe play starts with some good defense with the gam close in the third quarter, namely a Nik Stauskas block on a Jason Terry 3. Dario Saric got the deflected shot on the baseline and launched a pass to Embiid at the opposite 3-point line. Two Bucks defenders magically disappeared, leaving Embiid all alone to launch himself just before the key and come down with a massive dunk. \n\nEmbiid also did some work on his side of the court. Right after his thunderous dunk, he denied Matthew Delavadova with a huge block to end the third quarter.\njimadair3: 18 Comcast Sports Network Philadelphia Sixers Post Game Live https://t.co/RUmMYvL2RI pic.twitter.com/JuNHsRgTOH \n— FanSportsClips (@FanSportsClips) January 16, 2017 \n\nEmbiid also put in time defending the rim against an Antetokounmpo dunk.\njimadair3: 21 Comcast Sports Network Philadelphia Sixers Post Game Live https://t.co/5tGQtULJ9Z pic.twitter.com/7kU1WfBCr2 \n— FanSportsClips (@FanSportsClips) January 16, 2017 \n\nThe one helped the Sixers hang on in the fourth quarter and pick up their 13th win of the year. It’s just another example of the impact Embiid is having on a Philadelphia team that isn’t good yet, but is definitely fun to watch.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T04:10:30.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
