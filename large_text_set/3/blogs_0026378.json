No crime scene clues of note and no message from the killer, just a bunch of dead snakes.\nSEE ALSO: Extremely excited dog adorably fails his Crufts agility competition\nAnd despite all the animal lovers out there, no one seems to raising all that much of a stink over the possibly non-accidental death of these innocent, slithering zoo residents, which included some endangered species.\nFollowing the incident, surfaced by the Knoxville Sentinel , the rest of the animals housed in the building were moved while an investigation into the incident is being conducted. Sure, this could just be a non-malicious accident of some sort. However, at this point, officials have found nothing in the snake's habitat to indicate that the facility might have been the problem.\nJoin us for story time this morning at 10:30 in the log cabin. @zooknoxville @smotherb\nA post shared by Zoo Knoxville (@zooknoxville) on Jan 18, 2017 at 6:16am PST\nWhen Harambe the Gorilla was killed, it didn't take long for social media to hop online and begin memorializing the animal as an innocent victim of human fear. And people are still angry about the death of Cecil the Lion .\nBoth gorillas and lions are capable of ripping humans limb from limb.\nBut the death of 33 snakes? Not a peep.\nApparently, the snuffing out of the lives of centuries old symbols of evil and menace in many cultures (in many cases, unfairly) just doesn't get the same human response as our furrier friends in the animal kingdom.\nSo aside from the \"don't kill masses of snakes\" lesson (because that's just not cool), the other lesson here is that in the animal memorial sweepstakes, unless you're a whale or dolphin, having fur helps. A lot. Especially when you're dead. And maybe need to be avenged.\nWATCH: Heartbreaking images emerge of mass stranding of over 400 whales", "external_links": ["https://www.zooknoxville.org/", "http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2017/03/25/33-reptiles-dead-after-event-zoo-knoxville/99618446/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/wg2CRLuC.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/wg2CRLuC.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPaKOV4DfvX/"], "published": "2017-03-26T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:23:46.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
