He will be active for tonight's game vs. Delaware at Hershey Centre. \n— Raptors905MR (@Raptors905MR) January 28, 2017 \nSullinger recently returned from a foot injury that sidelined him for the first 41 games of the Raptors’ season. The 24-year-old has struggled since being re-activated, averaging a measly 4.0 points and 2.6 rebounds on 25.8 per cent shooting in 14.0 minutes per game. \nThe Raptors had lost five straight games with Sullinger in the lineup, but ended up snapping the slide on Friday against the Milwaukee Bucks with Sullinger listed as a DNP-CD. \nThis will mark the first time in the five-year veteran's career that he will play in a D-League game.
