Durkin | 7:04 am, February 16th, 2017 \nThe host of CNN’s GPS did not hesitate to call out President Donald Trump ‘s strange joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for what it was: “So bizarre, so casual, frankly, so irresponsible.” \nFareed Zakaria joined his network colleague Don Lemon late Wednesday to break down Trump’s first official meeting with Netanyahu , who came to the White House to speak alongside the President. But despite the optics, Zakaria identified that POTUS seemed woefully unprepared for the setting. \nZakaria furthered, “[Trump was] obviously not briefed,” before Wednesday’s joint news conference, given his peculiar responses to a two-state solution and his outright unwillingness to condemn our nation’s rise in anti-semitism. “You can’t get a sense whether this was a seriously thought-out issue or, as happens so much with Donald Trump, he was just kind of winging it,” Zakaria continued. He wondered why Netanyahu needed to step in at times during the presser and answer on behalf of his American counterpart. \n“The whole thing was kind of surreal, and why it was embarrassing to watch a President be so under-briefed and by given this assist by the Israeli Prime Minister,” said Zakaria. \nLemon at one point asked the GPS host if he should be in consideration to assist the White House with foreign policy given the presumed gaps in knowledge that President Trump has on these crucial topics. However, Zakaria opined that his critical take on Wednesday’s joint news conference would quickly end any such notion. \n“If there were any such prospect, this interview has just taken care of that,” he joked.
