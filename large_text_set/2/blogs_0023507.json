Berlin previously announced in May 2016 that it would enhance its military by 14,300 troops, the first such increase since the end of the Cold War. But the number of additional soldiers was changed to 20,000 after revision, and under the new plan, the Bundeswehr is expected to grow to a total of 198,000 by 2024. \"The Bundeswehr is under demand like never before,\" Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday, specifically pointing out the role of the German unified armed forces in the stabilization of Mali, in combating Daesh in Iraq and Syria, and, as a NATO member, defending the Baltic from a so-called Russian Threat. \"In light of these increasing responsibilities, the Bundeswehr must be allowed to grow accordingly,\" she said. © AFP 2016/ Christof Stache Germany to Set New Record for Deporting Failed Asylum Seekers The administration of US President Donald Trump has sharply criticized what it views as deficient European monetary investment in NATO.
