New Orleans' clock management was the abomination of abominations. An inexcusable mismanagement of the clock. 3/15/2017, 12:45:51 AM Frye led the team with 18 points off the bench on 7-of-10 shooting, while Erik Thomas added 12 points and eight rebounds. It wasn't enough to pull off the win, however. Mount St. Mary's now has two days to prepare for the No. 1 overall seed in the tournament in Villanova. The game will be Thursday at 7:10 p.m. ET, but at least the trip from Dayton to Buffalo won't be too long. The squad will have to be nearly perfect to upset Josh Hart and company in the round of 64. Postgame Reaction While much of the discussion after the game involved New Orleans' decision not to foul on the final defensive possession, head coach Mark Slessinger believed in his call. \"There was 3-4 second difference on clock, the coach said, per Jim Kleinpeter of NOLA.com. \"We felt pretty good. Felt we could get a stop.\" Meanwhile, he also noted the performance was atypical for his squad. \"There were a lot of things we did that were outside of us and what we did this year,\" Slessinger added, per Kleinpeter . Mount St. Mary's will move on to face the defending champions, which apparently doesn't scare the players, via CBS Sports: CBS Sports Network @CBSSportsNet 3/15/2017, 1:59:17 AM \"At the end of the day, we all play basketball,\" Long said of the matchup against Villanova. \"You know, it's the same size ball, same size net; it's just who wants it bad. Villanova is a great team, and one thing they bring to the table is their heart, so we just have to match that and I think we'll be in a good position to beat them or play down to the wire and see if we can break a bracket.\" The team will hope the confidence can pay off in the 1-16 battle Thursday.
