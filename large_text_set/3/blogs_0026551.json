Is there an inexplicable absence on your mantel or bedside table? Deep down, do you know that a Nike Air Max candle would remedy that absence? Yeah. We thought so.\nLucky for you, handmade candle and soap company What the Shape has produced a candle replica of the ’95 Nike Air Max ahead of Nike Air Max Day on March 26th, and suffice to say that it is fresh with a capital PH .\nAvailable online now for $10 — with worldwide shipping! — decking out your home with sneakers has suddenly become much more affordable (and, frankly, socially acceptable). You can place your order by DMing the company on Instagram .\nA post shared by WHAT THE SHAPE (@what_the_shape) on Mar 17, 2017 at 3:25am PDT \nNike Air Max Day was first celebrated in 2014 , marking the release of the first ever Air Max 1 sneaker on March 26th, 1987. Nike declared the day a holiday, and sneakerheads went along with it. Three years later, we’ve got Air Max candles — so obviously the holiday was a success.\nA post shared by Nordstrom (@nordstrom) on Mar 23, 2017 at 11:35am PDT \nEach year on Air Max Day, Nike releases limited-editions kicks and sneaker boutiques go insane, running Air Max promos, shooting Air Max videos, and even depositing casted Air Max sneakers around New York City.\nAnd, since 2017 marks the 30th anniversary of the original Air Max sneaker, you can bet that Nike has some serious plans up its sleeve for this year’s celebration. We already know that a toddler version of the Air Max 1 is coming (specially branded for Air Max Day, of course) as well as a VaporMax Triple Black featuring a visible air outer sole.\nSee you at a Nike store this Sunday?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:01:09.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
