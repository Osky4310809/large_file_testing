Gerrard returns to Liverpool 0:48 \nMarkovic, who has been capped 22 times, has played just 34 times for Liverpool since then manager Brendan Rodgers bought him for £20million (AU$33m) after impressing in Portuguese side Benfica’s 2014 domestic double and run to that season’s Europa League final. \nHowever, he has struggled and was sent out on loan to Turkish side Fenerbahce last season which also ended prematurely, because of injury, and failed to impress Rodgers’ successor Jurgen Klopp prior to the start of this season leading to his temporary move to Sporting. \nDORTMUND SNARE ‘NEXT ZLATAN’ AFTER REAL INTEREST \nBorussia Dortmund snapped up Swedish teenaged prodigy Alexander Isak in the face of intense competition from Real Madrid and other top European clubs. \nIsak — dubbed the next Zlatan Ibrahimovic — moved from AIK after just 24 games and 10 goals in the Swedish championship for a reported $14.2m \nDortmund also bolstered their credentials for unearthing young stars by extending the contract of American 18-year-old Christian Pulisic, considered another football wonderkid, until 2020. \nIsak this month became Sweden’s youngest international goalscorer at 17 years and 113 days. He had been linked to Real Madrid but joined the Bundesliga club after an apparent change of heart. \n“Alexander Isak is a hugely talented striker who many top clubs in Europe wanted to sign,” Borussia sporting director Michael Zorc said.

Both BVB and the player himself are convinced that this transfer has great potential.” \nAIK said that representatives from 90 European clubs turned up at the ground in October last year to watch Isak play in a match against Gothenburg. \nTop European sides, including reportedly Liverpool, had also been trailing attacking midfielder Pulisic, who joined Dortmund from high school as a 16-year-old. \nHe has been a first-team squad member since January and scored four times in the Bundesliga. Pulisic is the youngest full international for the United States and already has 11 caps. \n“I still have a lot to learn,” said Pulisic. “I feel Dortmund offers the best conditions to do that. I have the chance to play in front of over 80,000 fans. We have the best supporters in the world — it does not get any better than that!” Proud of my boys decision to stay and continue to grow as a player. BVB gave him an opportunity at 17yrs old...

The loan deal is until the end of the present campaign. \n“Gerard Deulofeu has joined AC Milan on loan until the end of the season,” read the statement on the Everton website. \n“The 22-year-old winger arrived at Goodison Park in the summer of 2013 on a season-long loan before returning on a permanent deal in July 2015. \n“He has scored eight goals in 75 appearances across his two spells and now moves to the San Siro looking to gain more game time.” Everton had been infuriated on Friday when Milan — who are presently seventh in Serie A 11 points adrift of leaders Juventus — announced the loan deal and the Italian side eventually removed the story from their website.
