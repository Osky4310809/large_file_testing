The FBI report sent to the Delhi Police in November 2015 had virtually ruled out the theory of 'polonium poisoning' having caused her death. In January 2016, the AIIMS medical board unanimously concluded that the cause of Sunanda Pushkar's death is poisoning. \n\"The circumstantial recovery of empty Alprex Tablets (27 tablets) and report of FBI which shows the presence of Alprax in stomach and its contents, spleen, liver section, half of each kidney, blood sample, as well as urine wet clothing, bed cover and bed sheet confirmed the death is due to excessive ingestion of Tablet Alprazolam,\" the written opinion read. \nHowever, after the Delhi Police failed to draw any conclusion on basis of the findings, the report was handed over to another medical board , set up in June 2016, for examination before further proceedings in the high-profile case. \nThe board consisted of four doctors from Delhi, Chandigarh, and Puducherry. \nHowever, the SIT is now waiting for Pushkar’s Blackberry Messenger chat transcripts. \nThe daily has quoted sources as saying that a US court has directed the authorities to expedite the retrieving of BBM chats, which were found to be deleted after her death. \nAnother forensic report on Pushkar’s laptop from an Ahmedabad lab is also awaited. \nSeveral persons, including Tharoor, have been questioned in connection with Sunanda's death. The police have also conducted polygraph test on six persons, all prime witnesses in the case, including Tharoor's domestic help Narayan Singh, driver Bajrangi and Sanjay Dewan, a close friend of the couple. \nTarar has also been questioned about her relation with the Congress leader and his wife, her fight with Sunanda over Twitter, and other issues revolving around Sunanda's death. \n  Saturday, January 28, 2017 - 09:56 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T07:21:37.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
