Musk being, well, Musk , tease a \"Model Y\" on Twitter.\nSEE ALSO: Elon Musk and electric vehicles will win the energy battle against Trump's favorite fuels\n\"Model Y is coming too in a few years,\" Musk tweeted. \"Kinda have to.\" And that's all we know about the Model Y. Will it be a sedan like the Model S or Model 3, or will it be an evolution of the gull-winged Model X? Or maybe it'll be something entirely different. WHO KNOWS?!\n@varunfatehpuria Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017\nThanks a lot, Musk! Now we're going to be up every night wondering what the Model Y will look like.\nIn addition to teasing the Model Y, Musk also dropped a six-second video showing the first drive of a release candidate of the Model 3 casually rolling down the street.\nFirst drive of a release candidate version of Model 3 pic.twitter.com/zcs6j1YRa4\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017\nAnd while he was on Twitter, Musk shared a few other fun facts about the Model 3. For example, the Model 3 was originally going to be called the Model E, but Ford apparently sued to block it, so it's now called the \"S3X.\" Get it? No? If it was called Model E, the company's lineup would be: Model S, Model \"E\" and Model X. Do you see it now?\nModel 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017\nWith the Model Y, Tesla's lineup would spell out \"S3XY.\" LOL.\nMusk also clarified a small misunderstanding: The Model 3 is not the next version of the Model S. It's a more affordable option that sits below the Model S and Model X.\nAm noticing that many people think Model 3 is the \"next version\" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017\nThe billionaire entrepreneur says the Model S will always win on performance because it has more space for a bigger battery.\n@Skate_a_book Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017\n@dr_angus Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017\nWATCH: Elon Musk says beautiful solar roofs are the key to sustainable future", "external_links": ["https://t.co/zcs6j1YRa4", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/845293157977767937", "https://twitter.com/varunfatehpuria", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/C4cLNk1j.jpg", "https://twitter.com/Skate_a_book", "https://twitter.com/dr_angus", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/845280754871418880", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/845281547368349696", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/845278449811939328", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/845282934546350080", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/C4cLNk1j.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/845287211306139648"], "published": "2017-03-25T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:03:39.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
