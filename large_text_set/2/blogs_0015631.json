And it’s that small percentage that is a challenge for our community (that) is a challenge for me.” \nMarshall kneeled for seven games last season and lost multiple endorsement deals as a result. He decided to stand midway in November after Denver Police announced they would revise their use-of-force policy to encourage officers to rely more on de-escalation techniques and limit the use of weapons. \n“I’m encouraged with the many productive discussions and progress that has taken place as the Denver Police department has decided to review its use of force policy,” Marshall wrote in an Instagram post . “I’m proud to have joined so many of my peers throughout sports who’ve also made their own statements. Going forward, I will be standing for the National Anthem — not because everything is perfect, or because I’m changing my stance on things. But because of my hope for what we can become.” \nMarshall also pledged to donate $300 per tackle he made last season (52) to selected local organizations, has worked with Denver’s Rose Andom Center to support victims of domestic violence, and, among other things, challenged Denver elementary school students to improve attendance .
