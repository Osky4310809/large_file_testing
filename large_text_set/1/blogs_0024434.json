Could   \nA couple have made a formal complaint after claiming they found their stillborn baby had been placed in a hospital storage cupboard. \nElaine Smith and partner David Cameron say they were also left distraught after finding out there was a delay of more than an hour before he was taken to the mortuary at Leicester Royal Infirmary . \nBaby Aaron was due on November 3 but on Tuesday, October 4, Elaine began feeling unwell. Unable to get a response from her community midwife she went to the infirmary's maternity assessment unit on Friday, October 7. \nThe 40-year-old, from Saffron Lane, Leicester, told Leicester Mercury : \"They couldn't find a heartbeat and I was told my baby had died. \n\"I just screamed the place down. It was awful.\" Read More Incredible moment mother paralysed on hen do stands up and holds daughter for the first time \nThe next day Elaine had to go through the agony of labour to have the baby she knew would be stillborn. \n\"We were told that Aaron would be put on a special cold mat in a nursery specifically for 'sleeping' babies. \n\"He was born at 9.26pm - it was absolutely horrible, horrendous, but Aaron still looked gorgeous.\" \nElaine kept him with her until 1am when she asked if he could be put in the nursery. But, she asked for him back again at around 4am. \nShe said: \"When he was brought to me he wasn't cold. There was no-one with me, it was dreadful.\" \nElaine asked for Aaron to be taken away again at 7.30am on the Sunday as partner David was coming in with their other young children. \nIt was when David arrived and asked to see his son that he says he found him in his Moses basket in what Elaine described as a storage cupboard. \nShe claimed: \"It wasn't the special nursery which had been described to me.\" there was a delay of more than an hour before he was taken to the mortuary at Leicester Royal Infirmary \nDavid said: \"I just picked Aaron up and sat on the floor crying.\" \nLater that day he went back to get Aaron as Elaine was due to be discharged home.

In this case the parents didn't call the unit.\" \nShe added: \"When baby Aaron was stillborn he was placed in a special room on the delivery suite. \n\"Aaron's parents felt it better for their other children if Aaron was not in this room when they visited.\" \nMs Broughton said that once Aaron's parents had left to go home a midwife washed and wrapped the baby and completed the necessary paperwork for transfer to the mortuary. \nShe added: \"Done respectfully and properly this takes time.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T12:55:03.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
