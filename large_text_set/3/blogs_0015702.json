I have no doubt. He would not have been able to overpower Danielle on his own. Danielle's body was found on a beach \n“I have a feeling that it was more than one person but we have to verify everything with evidence. I believe Danielle’s attackers took her to another place other than the place where the body was found.” \nMr Varma, who also worked on the case of Scarlett Keeling, the 15-year-old murdered in Goa in 2008, added: “Bhagat’s story is that he was alone with Danielle which is doubtful. \n“Bhagat’s clothes had blood on them and Danielle’s clothes were found close to his house. \n“But these small criminal gangs operate in groups of four to six people. They share the spoils of their exploits. They are very loyal to each other.” Vikas Bhagat has been charged with the murder and rape of 28-year-old British woman Danielle McLaughlin (Photo: Barcroft Media) \nMr Varma went on: “Danielle was 5’8” tall and she was really strong. This fellow Bhagat, he does not look strong and muscular. \n“I doubt he had the strength to overcome Danielle on his own. If she was intoxicated there would have been no need for the terrible injuries she suffered.” \nHe spoke as Bhagat, 23, appeared in court on 20 different charges of theft against tourists. Bhagat has allegedly confessed to police he killed Danielle. \nBut he denies raping her, claiming the pair were involved in an ‘on-off’ relationship. \nDanielle’s best friend Nicole Farren urged local people to come forward with all the information they have to bring Danielle’s abusers to justice. \n“We understand there is a lot of pressure on you the local people to protect criminals operating in the area who have a lot of power,’ she said. \n“Sometimes it is time to stand up and take a stand and say ‘No, Enough is Enough’. \n“We want justice for Danielle, she deserves justice.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:18:44.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
