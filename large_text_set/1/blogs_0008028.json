They have priorities and the priority was for Leo not to come. I think coming here [Zurich] they could fight more than they would in Barcelona.\" \nMadrid icon Roberto Carlos was also miffed by Barca's decision, suggesting Messi could learn humility from Ronaldo. \n\"I am sad and disappointed that Leo and his team-mates have not come. They have many great footballers and all of us would have liked to see them attend,\" the former Brazil international said before the ceremony. \n\"We all wanted to see Messi, the other big players and the coach of Barcelona here. It's a FIFA prize. FIFA is the highest authority in football. So everyone should be here. \n\"Cristiano has learned the importance of this and I think Leo also needs to learn that he must be here. This has to change. \n\"Real Madrid also have a match this week but they are well represented in Zurich. The obligations to win for both clubs are the same.\" \nSalgado stated that he expected better from Barca, one of the biggest clubs in world football. \nHe said: \"Real Madrid are currently the best team in the world so maybe this has affected the decision of the Barcelona players. Barcelona are wrong for not sending their best players. \nHeerenveen seal loan deal for Odegaard \n\"I know that the club has had issues with FIFA in the past but Barcelona needs to understand that FIFA is changing. This is not how you expect one of the world's biggest clubs to behave.\" \nUpon receiving his award, Ronaldo said he was \"sorry\" that the Barca players were not in attendance but that it was \"understandable\".
