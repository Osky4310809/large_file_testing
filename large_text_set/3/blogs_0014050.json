Once the palace became a hotel at the turn of the century, the beau monde began to visit. King Edward VII took a suite for a month every summer and was joined by his mistress, Alice Keppel, along with his doctor, two equerries, two valets, two footmen and dog Caesar. The hotel is a 12-mile stroll from the charming old fishing town of St-Jean-de-Luz, pictured Noel Coward, the Duchess of Windsor and Churchill also stayed. Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra opened the outside pool, where today wealthy Russians and Spaniards plough away. The Hotel du Palais wears its age and pedigree with charm. Its modern spa and pool are as stylish as any. Its semi-circular, Michelin-starred restaurant looking out over the Atlantic swell must be one of the most beautiful places to eat in Europe. Yet it retains an old-school approach to customers that, far from being starchy, feels reassuring. Built as a summer home by Napoleon III, the imperial residence gave the town chic appeal We walk off our breakfasts on a cliff path that goes past a lighthouse on a high headland. From the lighthouse, we potter along the promenade and break off for a tumble-dryer of a swim among the waves. We eat fat Atlantic prawns and squid with rosé by the old fishermen’s port — also built by Napoleon. You can continue walking to the sheltered old fishing town of St-Jean-de-Luz a dozen miles away. Instead, we drive there one evening to eat local seafood and farm produce at the Ilura restaurant in Hotel la Reserve. We also head into the Pyrenean foothills, an hour away, to towns such as Espelette, which uses strings of plump chillies to decorate its buildings, and Sare, popular with hill-walkers and reminiscent of the Lake District. Finally, we leave Biarritz by car for Bilbao, two hours across the Spanish border, to visit the remarkable Guggenheim museum before flying home. But we’ll be back, Biarritz.
