(Amazon Photo) A 6-year-old Dallas girl talking to her family’s new Echo Dot about cookies and a dollhouse ended up with the items in hand after Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa mistook the conversation as an order for the items.\nMegan Neitzel told Fox News that she recently received the Dot as a gift from her in-laws and that the device had not been hooked up for long when she overheard her kids telling it knock-knock jokes.\nSoon she received a confirmation email saying that her order for cookies and a dollhouse had been placed.\nOops! It turns out @amazon 's Alexa mistook the 6 y.o.'s conversation about cookies and a dollhouse for an order. https://t.co/PHpOW6oaCA pic.twitter.com/I1A5mYRgvx \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 3, 2017 \n“It was a $170 Kidcraft dollhouse and 64 ounces, four pounds, of cookies,” Neitzel said, adding that she knew her daughter Brooke could be the only one to place such an order.\nThe little girl did confess to discussing the items with Alexa, but not ordering them. Her mom has since activated a parental control feature that requires four digits for all future purchases.\nThe family has been enjoying the cookies and is looking for a local charity to take the dollhouse.\nAlexa made more news just a few days ago when a video was trending on YouTube in which a small boy asked his Dot to play something and the device replied with porn-related phrases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:35:34.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
