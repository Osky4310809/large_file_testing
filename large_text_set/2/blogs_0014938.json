But that hasn’t stopped scientists from judging your nutrition habits based on the food you “virtually” consume on Twitter, according to a new study in the journal PLoS ONE . \nResearchers at the University of Vermont looked through 50 million tweets sent between 2011 and 2012 that included buzz-worthy food words and terms, then used a tool called the Lexicocalorimeter—an interactive instrument for measuring the ‘caloric content’ of social media food—to gauge users’ eating behavior. For example, if 5 years ago you tweeted, “How many cookies do I get to eat after running this marathon? ALL of them,” the Lexicocalorimeter would automatically pick up your tweet and analyze it based off the words “cookies” and “running.” The tool would then associate “running” with the average amount of calories burned during a 60-minute run and compare it to the average number of calories in a cookie.
