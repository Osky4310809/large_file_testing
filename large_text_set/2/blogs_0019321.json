FilmMagic for YouTube \nYouTube has agreed to let a third party audit its advertising metrics amid growing concerns that platforms owned by Facebook and Google may not be reporting their data accurately. \nIn an announcement in The Wall Street Journal , Google, which owns YouTube, said it will allow the Media Rating Council, an ad industry group, to track ad measurements on the video network. The move will make sure YouTube is accurately reporting viewing statistics to its advertisers. \nFacebook also announced it would allow the Media Rating Council to audit its ad metrics following a few recent incidents where the social network admitted it miscalculated some of its ad metrics , angering advertisers. \nThere hasn't been any evidence so far that Google or YouTube has miscalculated metrics, but the audit by the Media Rating Council should help alleviate concerns from advertisers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:47:20.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
