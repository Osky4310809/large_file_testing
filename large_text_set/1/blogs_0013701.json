Brooks acknowledged that Sessions has received “a failing grade for years on end.” \nGraham went through how Republicans like Sessions and himself get very low grades while Democrats get very high ones. \nBrooks said the grades are based on legislation and not party affiliation (the metrics in their legislative report card are whether members voted with the NAACP position on a civil rights issue), but Graham said it’s “really odd” there would be such a remarkable disparity: \n“You’re picking things that conservative Republicans don’t agree with you on and liberal Democrats do. I hope that doesn’t make us all racist and all of them perfect on the issue.” \nWatch above, via C-SPAN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:39:25.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
