Neymar converted the spot-kick before Sergi Roberto scored in the sixth minute of injury-time, as Barcelona won the tie 6-5 on aggregate. \nThe referee has been heavily criticised in the French press for his performance and now the Spanish publication Marca are reporting that Aytekin is likely to be struck from the Champions League match officials list. \nThat decision ultimately rests with former referee Pierluigi Collina, who now works as UEFA’s Head of Refereeing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T01:13:11.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
