The group’s most recent LGBTQ and HIV-Affected Hate Violence report found 24 hate violence homicides of LGBTQ people in 2015—a 20% increase from the year before. Of the victims in 2015, 54% were transgender women of color. \nEmily Waters, Senior Manager of National Research and Policy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project , said the Donald Trump administration has trans communities concerned that their safety is even more under threat. \n“We are already seeing signs that the new administration will be stepping back protections for transgender people. In a moment when we are seeing the highest number of reports of homicides of transgender and gender non-conforming people, we need policies that protect the rights and safety of transgender people—not roll backs,” Waters said in a statement to reporters. \nEquality Toledo, a local LGBTQ rights organization, has set up a GoFundMe page to help Striker’s family with funeral costs. \n“Jojo Striker’s murder in Toledo, Ohio remains unsolved and is yet another disturbing reminder that our transgender friends and family are under attack … Thank you in advance and please continue to have conversations about these heinous attacks against our community,” the post reads.
