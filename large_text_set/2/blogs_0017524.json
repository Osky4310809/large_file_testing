Samsung has pushed the update to only a handful of countries since the rollout began last month , but the update seems to be reaching a lot more markets today, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. The official Nougat firmware for these regions are now available for download from our firmware section ( here for the S7 and here for the S7 edge), and the update should also be making its way to devices over the air in the coming days. \nAs always, those unwilling to wait can download the firmware for their country from our database and do a manual upgrade using a PC; the update should also be available through Samsung’s Smart Switch program . To see what’s new on the latest version of Android, don’t forget to take a look at our comprehensive list of features .
