Heads turned in every direction, taking in all details.\n“We’ve been watching the pictures and following on social media,” said Adam Holtkamp, a civil engineer who drove from Merritt Island with his 9-year-old son to see the building in person. “It’s awesome.”\nThey were among the announced group of 10,473 visitors who toured Orlando City Soccer Club ’s new downtown stadium during an open house on Saturday.\nThe event began shortly after 9 a.m. and the main entrance was mobbed until doors closed at 1 p.m.\nFans walking to and from Orlando City Stadium passed under the faces of Pride defender Ali Krieger and Orlando City captain Kaká. The players beamed on posters hung from lamp posts that stretched down Church Street to Palmer Feed Store on the corner of Westmoreland Drive, where a chalkboard out front read, “Welcome to the hood Orlando City.”\nThe club also hosted a 5K run. Participants received a purple medal when they crossed the finish line in front of Sy’s Supermarket. A D.J. blasted music that mostly drowned out the drills, heavy machinery and trucks backing up, noise from construction crews hustling to finish the stadium before March 5, when the Lions open the Major League Soccer season against New York City FC.\nThe remaining work looks daunting to wrap up in eight days, but Orlando City owner Flávio Augusto da Silva and CEO Alex Leitão said it all will come together in time.\nDuring the open house, fans had access to the lobby, locker rooms, the club level, concourse, tunnel and stands along the west side of the stadium. The pitch was roped off and signs stuck in the ground read, “Please stay off the grass.”\nCurious fans could reach the very edges of the turf, though. It was tightly mowed, a vibrant shade of green, cold and moist.\nCaption Orlando City cuts the ribbon on its new stadium Orlando City SC cuts the ribbon on its new downtown Orlando stadium\nOrlando City SC cuts the ribbon on its new downtown Orlando stadium\nCaption Orlando City cuts the ribbon on its new stadium Orlando City SC cuts the ribbon on its new downtown Orlando stadium\nOrlando City SC cuts the ribbon on its new downtown Orlando stadium\nCaption Orlando City unveils new home jerseys Orlando City unveiled new home jerseys, adopting a new look for its first season playing in a new stadium.\nOrlando City unveiled new home jerseys, adopting a new look for its first season playing in a new stadium.\nCaption Orlando City players say Montverde Academy provides competitive scrimmage Orlando City forward Hadji Barry and midfielder Richie Laryea talk about the talent of Montverde Academy soccer players after facing the private area boarding and high school in a training scrimmage Saturday.\nOrlando City forward Hadji Barry and midfielder Richie Laryea talk about the talent of Montverde Academy soccer players after facing the private area boarding and high school in a training scrimmage Saturday.\nCaption Jason Kreis pleased with Orlando City's scrimmage vs Philadelphia Orlando City coach Jason Kreis said he saw some progress during the team's preseason scrimmage against the Philadelphia Union, which the Lions won 3-2.\nOrlando City coach Jason Kreis said he saw some progress during the team's preseason scrimmage against the Philadelphia Union, which the Lions won 3-2.\nCaption Orlando City goalkeeper coach Tim Mulqueen adjusting well to new job Orlando City goalkeeper coach Tim Mulqueen, who was hired in January to replace Stewart Kerr, says he is enjoying his new job and fits in well with the rest of the coaching staff.\nOrlando City goalkeeper coach Tim Mulqueen, who was hired in January to replace Stewart Kerr, says he is enjoying his new job and fits in well with the rest of the coaching staff.\n“I have awesome pictures,” Orlando resident Aileen Santos said as she scrolled through panoramic shots of the locker room, which will be used for all three professional teams under the Orlando City SC umbrella.\nSantos; her husband, Paul; and their two young sons, who Santos called “little lions,” walked through before the line backed up with dozens of people after the 5k ended. They’ve had season tickets since Orlando City joined MLS in 2015. Originally from California and New York, respectively, the couple is especially looking forward to the season opener and the L.A. Galaxy home match April 15. Both games sold out within minutes of tickets becoming available to the public.\n“Section 106, which we can’t get to,” Paul Santos said smiling and pointing to a section of the stadium not open for touring. “But, yeah, we just wanted to check out the new stadium. I mean, it’s new, new stadium smell, like a new house smell. It looks great so far. I want to see it filled up with all these people in a week. Looking forward to it.”\nKennedy Hawkins-Dale can’t wait, either. She’s 8 years old.\n“But on April 19th, I turn 9,” she said, clutching a sports card featuring Pride backup goalkeeper Aubrey Bledsoe as she waited in line for an autograph.\nAnd to celebrate, she’ll host her birthday party at the new stadium.\nHawkins-Dale and her mother scoured photos, maps and renderings of the new stadium online before it opened, picking out areas to hold about 20 children for the party.\nThe soon-to-be birthday girl approved of the space.\n“Oh, I think it’s really, really, really cool,” she said, nodding with each “really.” “Especially the locker room because then it goes out onto the field. Amazing.”\nardelgallo@orlandosentinel.com\n Sentinel Orlando City Lions Ali Krieger", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58b1f42b/turbine/os-sp-orlando-city-stadium-tour-0226", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58a4fef1/turbine/os-jason-kreis-pleased-with-orlando-city-scrimmage-vs-philadelphia-20170215", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58a37e6e/turbine/os-orlando-city-goalkeeper-coach-tim-mulqueen-adjusting-well-to-new-job-20170214", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-589f982e/turbine/os-orlando-city-says-montverde-academy-provides-competitive-scrimmage-20170211", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58a72ee3/turbine/os-orlando-city-unveils-new-home-jerseys-video-20170217", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58b07f7e/turbine/os-orlando-city-cuts-the-ribbon-on-its-new-stadium-20170224"], "published": "2017-02-25T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:37:42.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
