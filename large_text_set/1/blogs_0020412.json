According to the press release, more than 250,000 Redmi Note 4s were sold through Mi.com and Flipkart over the course of just 10 minutes , reportedly breaking the previous record for online sales of a smartphone.\nAmidst the success of Xiaomi’s popular Redmi Note 3, a device which broke the Indian record for highest-shipped smartphone, the Redmi Note 4 sold at least five times as well in its first online sale. XDA has previously deemed the Redmi Note 3 “the king of the low end” , matching much of the praise that the Redmi Note series has received for its combination of respectable specifications and extraordinary sub-$200 price point. The Redmi Note 4 has also received many glowing reviews following its international release in the second half of 2016, with most agreeing that it improved significantly upon the Redmi Note 3.\nOf course, the main (and potentially significant) difference between the Chinese variant of the Redmi Note 4 and the Indian version is a change in SoC from Mediatek’s Helio X20 to the Snapdragon 625. Aside from this change, the specifications remain essentially the same. The Indian market Redmi Note 4 features three different SKUs, ranging from 2 to 4GBs of LPDDR3 RAM, 32 or 64GBs of internal storage, and all with microSD expansion and a 5.5 inch 1080p LCD display. It will also house a fingerprint reader and likely continue the Redmi Note trend of excellent battery life as it sports a gargantuan 4100 mAh battery. As expected, the Redmi Note 4 will retain the all-metal construction and will also excitingly ship with an Android Nougat-based version of MIUI 8.\nResponding to the impressive initial success of the Redmi Note 4, Xiaomi India’s head Manu Jain had words of thanks and excitement for those who have supported the Mi brand in India.\n“We are really thankful to everyone for making the first sale of Redmi Note 4 a great success. We are extremely ambitious about this product and it gives me immense joy to start the year with such acceptance and love for Redmi Note 4. This love motivates us to work harder to make more quantities available for our Mi Fans and build a beautiful Redmi Note 4 story in India. We are excited as we take the first step in 2017 and look forward to achieving many more milestones this year.” Given the rapid growth of Xiaomi’s brand in India, having just surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue after entering the market only 2 years prior, the company will undoubtedly strive to ensure that their success continues into 2017 and beyond. Some have recently expressed uncertainty about the future of the company, citing a decision to not publish sales figures for 2016 and an admittedly rough Q2 2016. However, these concerns are likely rather inconsequential, and may be a result of a nearly-myopic obsession with growth in the mobile market.\n\nIn fact, CEO Lei Jin published a letter for his employees early this year in which he acknowledged that the company may have “pushed ahead too fast”, and has in a sense responded to this misstep by setting the same revenue goal it had in 2015 ($14.5 billion). He also reiterated that the company must remain committed to the admirable approach it began with which is to develop and produce high-quality devices at accessible prices while also ensuring that the pursuit of profit does not become the primary goal of the company. Given its successes in India, Xiaomi certainly appears prepared to continue making true on those promises.\nAccording to Xiaomi, the Redmi Note 4 will be next available on Jan 30, 2016 on Flipkart and Feb 03, 2016 on Mi.com starting at Rs 9999 (2GB RAM + 32GB Flash), Rs 10,999 (3GB RAM + 32GB Flash) and Rs 12,999 (4GB RAM + 64GB Flash).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T13:31:56.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
