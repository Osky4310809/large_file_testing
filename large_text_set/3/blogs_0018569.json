Fatigue has a price”, the United manager complained about the congested schedule again, saying his team shouldn’t have to get back on the field early on Sunday after playing in the Europa League on Thursday night. \n“They simply don’t care,” Mourinho said after United reached the Europa League quarterfinals by beating Rostov 1-0. \n“In other countries they try to do that little support to the teams in Europe. But here it is difficult. We go Sunday at 12 o’clock. Why? Why us? So it’s going to be even more difficult for us.” \nUnited played in the FA Cup on Monday, losing to Chelsea. They then had to play Thursday in the second leg of the Europa League. And the team now has only Friday and Saturday off before and an early wakeup call on Sunday to face Middlesbrough in the Premier League. \nOver Christmas they played five times in 16 days. \nThey still do not know when postponed Premier League games against Manchester City and Southampton will be played. \nUNITED’S POTENTIA FIXTURE LIST \nPremier League: West Brom (H), April 1 \nPremier League: Everton (H), April 4 \nPremier League: Sunderland (A), April 9 \nEuropa League: Anderlecht (A), April 13 \nPremier League: Chelsea (H), April 16 \nEuropa League: Anderlecht (H), April 20 \nPremier League: Burnley (A), April 23 \nPremier League: Swansea (H), April 30 \nEuropa League: ?, May 4 \nPremier League: Arsenal (A), May 6/7 \nEuropa League: ?

At least let us sleep a little bit on Sunday, right?” \nUnited is in sixth place in the Premier League with 49 points, six points behind fourth-place Liverpool and the coveted Champions League places. \nOn Thursday, United produced a lethargic performance in beating Russian club Rostov 1-0 and also lost midfielder Paul Pogba to a hamstring injury. \nMourinho said it was no surprise United was picking up injuries “due to an accumulation of fatigue.” \n“He was already feeling something in the first half and immediately he felt he couldn’t carry on in the second. Even a physical monster like him felt it,” Mourinho said.

When I watch marathons, when I watch other sports and people go to the limit, I don’t think it’s funny,” Mourinho said. “I don’t think it’s funny that some of our players have played 11 matches in six weeks.” Marcos Rojo of Manchester United eats a banana Source: Getty Images \nIn 1999, when United won the treble, they played 14 games in 54 days and that’s the schedule this crop are facing if they make it to the Europa League final. \nBut there’s a warning from Liverpool last year, if Mourinho considers conceding the top four race to concentrate on Europe. Jurgen Klopp’s side faded to eighth domestically and lost the Europa League final, meaning they missed out on Europe altogether. \nMeanwhile, Manchester United was fined 20,000 pounds ($24,700) by the English Football Association on Friday for failing to control its players in the FA Cup quarterfinal defeat at Chelsea. \nAfter midfielder Ander Herrera was sent off in the first half on Monday at Stamford Bridge, United players reacted angrily, surrounding referee Michael Oliver. \nHerrera was booked twice for fouling Chelsea winger Eden Hazard, the second time right in front of Oliver. \nUnited accepted the misconduct charge.
