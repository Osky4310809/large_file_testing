MAN CITY INJURIES \nAguero's injury will be the main concern for City, although the exact extent of the damage remains to be seen and he could very easily make a swift return to the line-up. Jesus took a heavy kick on Saturday but did not show any ill effects as he made his way out of Selhurst Park and should be available for selection. \nCity's injury list is actually as short as it has been all season, given Vincent Kompany and Fabian Delph, who both missed most of the first half of the campaign, made their full returns at the weekend. \nIlkay Gundogan remains on the sidelines with his serious knee injury. MAN CITY SUSPENSIONS \nFernandinho is back from his four-match ban and could slot straight back into the team, and West Ham have no suspensions to worry about either. MAN CITY POTENTIAL STARTING LINE-UP \nClaudio Bravo is likely to come back into the side for Willy Caballero, who played in the FA Cup. Elsewhere on the pitch things are easier to predict. \nJohn Stones has been in and out of the line-up in recent weeks, and with Pep Guardiola favouring a left-footed player at left-centre-back, he will now be competing with Kompany and Otamendi for the other position. Kompany insists he feels ready to play his second game in a week, although the City medical team will likely make a decision only on the day of the game. \nFernandinho should return in midfield, though Yaya Toure has been City's most consistent performer since he returned to the line-up and it will be hard to fit him in if, as expected, Guardiola picks Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva ahead of the deep-lying midfielder, with Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling on the wings and either Aguero or Jesus up front. WEST HAM DOSSIER \nIt is hard to pin down West Ham's form. Slaven Bilic's side are 10th in the Premier League table, which is probably a fair representation of their performances and form. \nThe Hammers have done enough recently to pull clear of any relegation battle, having won three games over Christmas. They then lost two league games and in the FA Cup against City at the start of January, but have returned to winning ways in their last two outings. \nDimitri Payet, of course, has returned to Marseille, and it will be interesting to see how the Londoners do without him for the rest of the season. As for Wednesday night, Mark Noble faces a fitness test on an ankle injury, while Diafra Sakho and Angelo Ogbonna are long-term casualties. \nIt remains unknown whether Robert Snodgrass, signed from Hull City last week, will be fit enough to make his first appearance. Jose Fonte, who arrived from Southampton, could make his debut at centre-back. \nCity will also have to be on their guard against Andy Carroll, who has scored four goals in his last five Premier League appearances, including three in his last two. BEST OPTA MATCH FACTS \nIn the Premier League, Aguero has six goals and two assists in nine appearances against the Hammers. \nSince the start of 2014-15, Manchester City have won just four of their 13 Premier League away games in London (W4 D4 L5). \nAndy Carroll has scored five goals in the Premier League against Manchester City, his joint-highest tally against an opponent in the competition (alongside Arsenal and Swansea). \nManchester City have seen a league-high eight goals scored by a substitute in the Premier League this season (incl. one own goal). \nKevin De Bruyne is set to make his 50th Premier League appearance in this match. He has 19 assists in his first 49 games - only two players have more than 19 assists from their first 50 PL apps (Eric Cantona 23 and Juan Mata 20). TV COVERAGE & KICK-OFF TIME \nThe game kicks off at 19:45 UK time on Wednesday, February 1, and is available on BT Sport 1 in the UK.
