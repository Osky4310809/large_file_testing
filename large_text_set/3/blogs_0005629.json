(Credit: AP/Eric Gay) \nA case being debated at the Texas Supreme Court could restrict the ability of married same-sex couples to access spousal benefits as part of a campaign by far-right extremists to overturn the federal ruling on Obergefell v. Hodges. \nLast week, the state’s highest court heard arguments in Pidgeon v. Turner, a case filed on behalf of two Houston residents, Jack Pidgeon and Larry Hicks. These two complainants argue that the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision legalizing marriage equality doesn’t extend to benefits like health insurance. The suit was originally filed against the city of Houston, which allowed LGBT city employees to put their married same-sex partners on their insurance plans following the 2013 ruling on United States v. Windsor. In a 5-4 decision, the court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act under the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \nAnnise Parker, then the mayor of Houston, decided that if the federal government couldn’t discriminate against same-sex couples, neither could the city and championed legislation securing that right. But the complainants filed suit against Houston, arguing that the state’s Constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, which was voted in via referendum in 2005, should supercede the SCOTUS decision. \n“A state court’s ultimate obligation is to the Constitution, not to the jargon and innovations created by Supreme Court justices,” lawyers representing Pidgeon and Hicks claimed in court filings, adding: “Obergefell may require states to license and recognize same-sex marriages, but that does not require states to give taxpayer subsidies to same-sex couples — any more than Roe v. Wade requires states to subsidize abortions or abortion providers.” \nThe Texas Supreme Court initially declined to hear the case last September in a 8-1 decision. The only dissenter, Justice John Devine, argued that insurance benefits should be exclusive to opposite-sex couples because those are “the only marital [relationships] where children are raised by their biological parents.” The court, however, reversed its decision in January following months of lobbying efforts by Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and Attorney General Ken Paxton, who filed an amicus brief urging the bench to reconsider. \nIf the Texas Supreme Court already turned down the case, why would it agree to take it up just months later? Chuck Smith, the CEO of Equality Texas, claimed the court “caved to political pressure.” \n“I think that the Texas Supreme Court got it right the first time when they were asked to hear this case and turned it down,” Smith argued. “The reason they’re hearing it now is plain politics — pure and simple. Our Supreme Court justices in the state of Texas are elected. They’re elected by party.” \nHe added that because the all-Republican bench has to run for reelection, trying the case could appeal to social conservatives on election day. \nIf the court were to rule against same-sex couples, it would prevent city employees — such as firefighters, sanitation workers, and librarians — from adding their legally wedded spouses to insurance. Jessica Jones is the wife of a police officer in Collin County, located on the outskirts of Dallas. Jones, 29, works for a children’s advocacy center that doesn’t offer benefits to employees. An unfavorable decision would remove her from her wife’s insurance. The couple are raising two children together and are planning to have another child through artificial insemination. If Jones carries the baby, the child would be uninsured. \n“They don’t take into account how it affects so many lives,” Jones said. “My wife is a police officer and puts her life on the line every day. I work a children’s advocacy center. We’ve fostered children and adopted out of the foster system. We give back so much.” \nJimmy Flannigan, sworn in earlier this year as the first openly gay member of Austin’s city council, is another employee that would be impacted by the decision. Flannigan, who is currently in a relationship, would be blocked from the benefits that the city of Austin has allowed same-sex partners for over a decade were he to get married. Since 2006, the Texas capital began offering spousal benefits to LGBT employees in long-term committed relationships. \n“This is offensive and brutal,” he said. “It’s about rank political cowardice.” \nFlannigan added that chipping away at marriage benefits for same-sex couples is the exact same political maneuver the right-wing accused liberals of doing for decades — pushing a political agenda through the court system. The councilmember called it “hypocrisy.” \n“When the judiciary affirms civil rights in a way that the GOP does not like, they call it ‘judicial activism,’” he said. “When the judiciary affirms things they do like, it’s just fairness.” \nBut Ken Upton, Senior Counsel at Lambda Legal, believes that the legal team behind the case has more than benefits for same-sex couples in Texas on its mind. Jared Woodfill and Jonathan Saenz , the attorneys representing the Houston complainants, are aligned with some of the most consistently anti-LGBT forces in the state . Saenz is the President of Texas Values, a right-wing organization that believes “homosexual marriage [is] waging war on marriage.” Woodfill was the spokesperson for the campaign to repeal Houston’s nondiscrimination ordinance in 2015, which falsely portrayed trans people as dangerous predators targeting young girls. \nUpton explained that the ultimate goal of Woodfill and Saenz is to get Pidgeon v. Turner in front of the Supreme Court. If Texas judges decide in favor of the petitioners, there’s likely to be an immediate stay on the ruling, which would require further action from SCOTUS. And if Texas upholds same-sex benefits, the complainants would have the ability to appeal that decision. The latter scenario has become more enticing with the nomination of Neil Gorsuch, a conservative Constitutionalist, to the nation’s highest court. \nWoodfill told the Texas Tribune that “given the changing composition” of SCOTUS, he believes the court — especially if more spots on the bench open up — could reverse its earlier decision on marriage equality. “Ultimately, I would like to see Obergefell overturned,” he said. \nTexas isn’t the first attempt to change the court’s mind on the freedom to marry. Last year, the Alabama Supreme Court declined to hear arguments that the state prohibition against unions for same-sex couples still stood, even despite federal jurisprudence. Despite that case’s dismissal, the national GOP threw its weight behind these legal challenges during the 2016 Republican National Convention. The party added an intent to rollback marriage equality as a central tenet of its official platform. \nUpton, though, believes that these right-wing opponents of LGBT rights overestimate how much the court wants to retry what even President Trump has called “settled” law . \n“Even the judges who disagreed with Obergefell — and there were four of them — I can’t imagine that they would say, ‘It’s OK for states to disregard our rulings if they don’t like them,’” Upton said. “That’s a threat to the safety of the court system generally.” \nSarah Warbelow, the Legal Director for the Human Rights Campaign, said that while it might appear that the nation is moving to the right following the 2016 election, the Supreme Court has done the opposite in the past few decades. Warbelow claimed that since Romer v. Evans, a 1996 decision ruling that laws blocking LGBT people from statewide nondiscrimination protections violate the Equal Protection Clause under the 14th Amendment, SCOTUS has increasingly favored LGBT equality. \n“There is a very clear trendline with the U.S. Supreme Court that doesn’t allow for differential treatment of LGBT people,” she said. \nAlthough Vic Holmes, a retired U.S. Air Force veteran , called the Texas Supreme Court case a “slap in the face with an iron glove,” he is heartened by the increasing support from his fellow Texans. Holmes and his husband, Mark Phariss are one of the couples who challenged the state’s marriage ban following the Windsor decision. Holmes and Phariss filed an amicus brief stating that repealing benefits for same-sex couples would impose a “ second-class status on our marriage.” \n“At their core, [the plaintiffs in Pidgeon v. Turner are] asking to continue the discrimination that existed prior to Windsor and Obergefell,” Holmes, 47, said. “It’s an insult to everything we fought for.” \nBut the couple, who have been together for almost 20 years, own a lake house in Gun Barrel City, which they describe as the “most Texas city you can imagine.” The town is so named because its main road is “straight as a gun barrel,” Phariss said. They eat breakfast every weekend they’re in town at a local restaurant. After local residents saw the couple on the news speaking out in favor of marriage equality, some called the diner asking them to refuse Holmes and Phariss service, which would be perfectly legal. The restaurant said no. \n“We don’t believe that most Texans support the blatant discrimination of LGBT people,” Phariss said. “That is not the Texans we’ve met through this process. We’ve met all kinds of great people, and they’re all on board with treating everybody fairly. I don’t think politicians are in touch with their constituency if they believe otherwise.” \nThe Texas Supreme Court isn’t expected to decide Pidgeon v. Turner until June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:18:27.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
