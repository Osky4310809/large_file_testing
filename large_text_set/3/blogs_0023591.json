The call for help has gone viral, shared more than 19,000 times.\nKatie Peden said losing her son’s prized possession felt like they were losing Bryn all over again.\n“This Kings snap-back hat was given to our son Braxton two years ago by my husband, Bryn, as it turned out to be too small for him and he said it’ll fit Braxton soon,” the 26-year-old told news.com.au.\nBryn was working in Canberra, far from their home in Tasmania, in 2016, as the family was preparing to move with him. But on March 2, 2016, Bryn died after hitting a tree on his motorcycle.\n“This hat is very sentimental to us,” Katie said, “as Bryn’s belongings are all we have left of him.”\nThe mother of two said Braxton was devastated by the loss, and thinks the hat was misplaced at Jetstar’s Terminal 2 at Sydney Domestic Airport.\n“He knows what happened to his dad and talks about him openly, as I try and keep his memory alive for the boys as much as possible,” Katie said.\nFor the family, it’s a part of their husband and father that’s missing.\n“People say, ‘But he’ll always be with you,’” Katie said. “But it’s not the same as Bryn physically being here.\n“Some people say, ‘It’s just a hat’ — but it’s so much more than that now.”\nBraxton was just 2 when his dad died, and baby brother Archie just 7 months old.\n“I’ve had a large amount of messages from complete strangers that are wonderful — from staff that work there, ground crew, engineers, to passengers that are traveling today [Wednesday] who said they’ll go and ask the staff and have a look for me,” Katie said.\n“Staff have circulated my post within their departments to try and track it down, which is so nice of them.\n“It’s great to see that there really are good people out there that are happy to try and help a complete stranger.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on News.com.au .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:34:49.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
