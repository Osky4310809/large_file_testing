He is a member of the “Maagap” Class of 1973. ADVERTISEMENT \n“Before we left the portals of the academy in 1973, our senior tactical officer had only one advice for us,” Lorenzana told the Salaknib class. \n“He said, ‘Stay alive.’ I also want to pass on to you that message because whether you are in the Air Force, Army or the Marines, it’s a dangerous place out there. You will risk your lives every day,” Lorenzana said. \nHe did not elaborate on what dangers the incoming military officers face, but the armed forces is battling terrorist groups in Mindanao and communist rebels. \nLorenzana told the graduating cadets to prepare for a different environment in the field. “Let your good deeds be your legacy,” he said, adding that “soldiers watch what their leaders do.” —WITH A REPORT FROM EV ESPIRITU", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:49:09.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
