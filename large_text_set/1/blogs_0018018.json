Jack Thorne’s playfollows Harry and the gang in middle age, but mainly focuses on the hero’s son Albus and his friendship with Scorpius Malfoy, the offspring of antagonist Draco. It opened in London last year , the script was published , and it’s on its way to Broadway . \nNow Screenrant has picked up on a recent episode of the Unofficial Universal Orlando Podcast in which guest Jim Hill— a “theme park historian,” who Screenrant reports has some good contacts— shares his purported knowledge about the studio’s plans. According to Hill, Cursed Child is being envisioned as a sort of “Harry Potter: The Force Awakens” with the likes of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint reprising their roles starting in 2026. “They want this trilogy of movies to have the actors that we know and love from the original films, that we watched grow up, as adults,” he said. “And, of course, they’re hiring a bunch of new, younger actors to play their children with the hope that, if we can lean on J.K., maybe there’ll be The Cursed Adolescent .” The Cursed Child ’s proposed cinematic future came up when Hill was discussing NBC Universal’s recent acquisition of the Potter television and digital rights . Hill said: “They not only have Potter , they have Fantastic Beasts and, supposedly, if you drill down into the language of the deal, they also have—when they’re finally made—the trilogy of movies that will be based on Harry Potter and the Cursed Child .” \nNow it’s worth noting that not only has J.K. Rowling indicated that Cursed Child will remain stage and page-bound , but Warner Bros. denied an earlier whisper about potential movie plans . However, it also could be the case that everyone will keep batting these rumors away until they decide to announce something concrete. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T17:56:23.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
