There are rules, unwritten ones at that, that you've got to follow no matter what happens. Sometimes you get lucky and get to live with someone who fast becomes a friend, or else life happens and you are stuck with a weirdo. No matter who your roommate is, if you've ever shared your home space, we bet you'll know the rules ... 1. There is an unsaid boundary that you need to always remember \nThere is a strict boundary that you need to adhere to at all times. Everything from the side of the bed, to the packet of milk in the fridge comes with a \"hers\" and \"yours\" tag and you need to be aware of it at all time. 2. Always be ready to disappear \nYou need to have some really good coffee shops or nearby book haunts on your hangout list at all times. Her best friend is visiting and she needs to vent about her boyfriend, her boyfriend is visiting and they need to get busy ... you really need a place to go during these times. 3. Yes you are at home, but you cannot really let go and feel completely at home \nRemember those times when you were staying at home and you would chuck your dirty clothes on the floor, binge watch your favourite sitcom all day long, and forget to take a bath during the weekend ... yeah not going to happen. You have another human being living with you now, who is not your sibling or your partner, so you do need to behave (a little). 4. Control the noise levels \nPhone conversations with the SO (significant other) into the wee hours of the night ... not going to happen either. You are living in the same room and noise levels have to be considered. So forget falling asleep while talking, you might most probably have to move to the kitchen to talk, freeze a little, and then jump back in bed once you are done. 5. Always give prior warning \nNo more spontaneous friends coming over for a party or making with out with the SO because the mood is just right. As per the \"Roommate Code\", you need to give her adequate warning so that she can plan her day better, and not be around when your friends are super drunk and passing out on her side of the bed. 6. Never snitch \nIf the landlord ever asks, neither of you have a boyfriend, neither of you loves to party and both of you are in bed by 10PM. Don't even think of snitching her out, you need to live with this person!
