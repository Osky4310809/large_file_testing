( BA ), Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT ) and General Electric Co. ( GE ) – have signed a letter to Congress supporting House Republicans' plan to implement the so-called border-adjustment tax or import tax. \"If we miss this chance to fundamentally reshape the tax code, it might take 30 years before we have another chance to try,\" argues the letter. \nThe Financial Times first reported the existence of the letter last Tuesday. Its other signatories include the bosses of Celanese Corp. ( CE ), Celgene Corp. ( CELG ), Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW ), Eli Lilly & Co. ( LLY ), Merck & Co. ( MRK ), Oracle Corp. ( ORCL ), Pfizer Inc. ( PFE ), Raytheon Co. ( RTN ) and United Technologies Corp. ( UTX ). \nIf passed, the plan is expected to benefit net exporters and hurt importers, who have come out in greater numbers against the plan. The Americans for Affordable Products Coalition (AAPC) was formed in early February to lobby against the tax. A statement from the group argued that the plan was \"nothing more than a giveaway to massive corporations already exploiting loopholes and taking advantage of special deals.\" Among the 150 businesses backing AAPC are Target Corp. ( TGT ), a $38 billion company, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT ), worth $212 billion. What Is the Border-Adjustment Tax? \nThe border-adjustment or import tax is a policy that originated in a 1997 paper by economist Alan Auerbach, who called it a destination-based cash flow tax. It was incorporated into a tax proposal put forward by House Ways and Means Committee chair Kevin Brady, a Republican congressman from Texas, and supported by Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. (See also, The Biggest Loser: Border-Adjustment Tax Edition . ) \nThe plan would lower the top marginal corporate tax rate from the current 35% – among the highest in the world – to 20%. It would apply to profits on imported and domestically produced goods, but not to profits on exports. The plan would allow companies to write off capital expenses and labor, but not net interest expenses. (See also, Do High U.S. Corporate Tax Rates Hurt Americans? ) \nProponents argue that the plan reduces the incentive for multinationals to reduce their tax bills – few if any actually pay the high statutory rate – by shifting profits to subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland. The tax would be applied based on where products are consumed, rather than where they are produced, so the system would be simpler and fairer. Brady says the tax is simply a form of the value-added taxes employed by most countries around the world. \nCritics, including AAPC, see consumers bearing the brunt of higher import costs: many basic household items such as clothing, furniture, electronics and kitchen appliances are imported. Lower-income individuals, who spend a greater share of their earnings on these items, would suffer more if the plan led to inflation in these products' prices. (See also, 9 Common Effects of Inflation . ) \nOn the other hand, the plan is expected to strengthen the dollar, which would increase Americans' purchasing power in the global market and potentially cancel out the upward pressure on imports' prices. However, a stronger dollar would make exports less attractive. The Wall Street Journal shows that border adjustment would increase the after-tax profits of exporters and decrease those of importers – unless the dollar gained 20% against other currencies, in which case exporters' profits would fall below current levels and importers' would rise. \nThat paradoxical result may be the reason for Donald Trump's reluctance to endorse the plan. The president, who has said that the dollar is too strong, called the House Republican proposal \"too complicated\" shortly before his inauguration. He favors tariffs instead: during the campaign he repeatedly called for a 35% levy on goods imported from Mexico and a 45% one on goods from China. (See also, A Rising Dollar May Backfire on Trump's Economic Plans . ) \nOther Republicans are similarly skeptical. Georgia Senator David Perdue, the former CEO of Dollar General Corp. ( DG ) and Adidas AG's Reebok subsidiary, has warned the plan \"hammers consumers\" (Dollar General is an AAPC member). South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham has said the plan won't get 10 votes in the Senate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:45:54.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
