The insurance agency will then offer a tiered discount based on the number of miles driven. That discount will increase the more a Tesla owner drives with Autosteer activated.\nNaturally, it's a smart way to encourage Tesla owners in Ohio to switch insurance companies. But it also speaks to a much larger disruption : as cars become safer with autonomous tech, insurance premiums will have to fall.\nTesla itself is already experimenting with that model in Hong Kong and Australia. The automaker has partnered with insurance companies to include insurance and maintenance into the final price of its vehicles.\nNew insurance models are expected to proliferate as other automakers advance their self-driving car efforts as well. The personal auto insurance sector could shrink to 40% of its current size within 25 years as insurance premiums fall due to self-driving tech, according to a report by the global accounting firm KPMG.\nRoot, for its part, said it plans to extend its Autosteer discount program to \"drivers of all self-driving cars\" later in 2017.\n\"We created Root to be the car insurance of the future,\" Root wrote in its blog post. \"Artificial intelligence? Self-driving cars? We’re ready.\"\nSEE ALSO: Tesla is already showing how the insurance industry will be disrupted by self-driving cars NOW WATCH: Tesla will begin selling its Solar Roof this year — here's everything you need to know   Tesla Tesla Autopilot Insurance BITranspo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T16:41:19.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
