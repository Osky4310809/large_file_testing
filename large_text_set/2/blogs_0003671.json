Bizzareslantpass says: Feb 7, 2017 11:56 AM \nSark will drink to that! cardinealsfan20 says: Feb 7, 2017 11:58 AM \nGood luck Coach Sark. Excellent coach, glad that is getting a chance to continue his recovery and be recognized in his profession. wimpyburgers says: Feb 7, 2017 12:00 PM \nWell, isn’t that a booger! ketch20too says: Feb 7, 2017 12:01 PM \nHope Quinn tells him to run the ball instead of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. wimpyburgers says: Feb 7, 2017 12:01 PM \n“Anyone know what kind of offense he runs?” \nI suspect he uses a lot of pick plays kane337 says: Feb 7, 2017 12:03 PM \nWell certainly no NFL owner would ever hire him as head coach so the Falcons should be able to hang on to him for a long time if he’s good. feckyerlife says: Feb 7, 2017 12:03 PM \nHe’s also the sole reason why they lost the superbowl. His over sized ego (which he had here in washington) wanted to destroy bellicheck instead of play it smart, all it did was bit him on the a**. When you are up 28-3 and proceed to run the ball 5 more times for the rest of the game, then you single handedly lost that game for your team \nillumination666 says: Feb 7, 2017 11:53 AM Every Falcons fan is the world is calling for Shannahans head right now.

I also heard that he will come if the price is right!! \nOOPS! Sorry! Feb 7, 2017 12:04 PM \nI didn’t see this coming. factschecker says: Feb 7, 2017 12:05 PM \nNick Saban must be terrible to work for——– Yeah I bet they are livid that their careers take off after Saban rehabbed their image. Saban does for coaches what BB does for players. They limp to him then gallop away. Better then ever. Feb 7, 2017 12:05 PM \nHahaha… Nick will be sick. \nImagine him even GRUMPIER…. ; ) spotsdad says: Feb 7, 2017 12:05 PM \nbut he did stay at a Holiday Inn Express………where he raided the mini-bar. I bet he runs the ball when he is supposed to, even if he is bleep faced. dickshotdogs says: Feb 7, 2017 12:05 PM \nWell, that hire officially marks the start of The Falcon’s Super Bowl hangover. Good luck. Feb 7, 2017 12:06 PM \n@the immaculatedecption says –“If an alcoholic’s lips move, he’s lying”. \nYou sir are the reason why so many alcoholics/addicts have difficulty in recovery. Neanderthalic attitudes such as yours do not benefit suffering individuals, their loved ones, or society as a whole. minson15 says: Feb 7, 2017 12:07 PM \nFreeman and Coleman are going to be happy. He likes to run the ball a lot! navyvandal says: Feb 7, 2017 12:09 PM \nwait…ALABAMA steve sarkisian?! I thought the whole purpose of him relieving Lane Kiffin was to BE the Offensive coordinator?! Feb 7, 2017 12:11 PM \n“Cutty” Sark gets a high pressure job in the NFL?! I’ll drink to that. Feb 7, 2017 12:17 PM \nCheers to Cutty Sark! Feb 7, 2017 12:20 PM \nWell, so much for the Falcons returning to the SB next year. stillperfect says: Feb 7, 2017 12:22 PM \nAll he said to get the job was “I would have ran the ball instead of passing” no drooling,chippy,tpet,Vancouver,crybabies allowed says: Feb 7, 2017 12:25 PM \nIf Sark is working hard to resolve his issues with alcohol abuse, I for one, wish him success. I’d like to see the man be a success. I think he has a creative offensive mind and might surprise some folks. We’ll see… Feb 7, 2017 12:31 PM \nI would like to toast to….. ah neva mind Feb 7, 2017 12:31 PM \nCheers! \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
