But the exact amount will depend on how many people apply. \nIn the lawsuit against the National Milk Producers Federation, filed in 2011, attorneys alleged dairy producers conspired in a price-fixing scheme to raise the price of dairy products by killing 500,000 cows and reducing the milk supply, according to court documents. The dairy industry agreed to a $52 million settlement, and the court in September signed off on it. \nFifteen states, including Arizona, are part of the lawsuit. United Dairymen of Arizona, a cooperative of more than 90 Arizona farms, is part of the National Milk Producers Federation. \n“The biggest dairy producers in the country, responsible for almost 70 percent of the nation’s milk, conspired together in a classic price-fixing scheme, forcing higher prices for a basic food item onto honest consumers and families,” said lead attorney Steve Berman in a September news release announcing a settlement. “We’re pleased that this settlement will return some of what consumers lost due to this massive fraud perpetrated for ill-gotten gains.” \nArizona residents who purchased milk or other fresh milk products like sour cream, cottage cheese, cream cheese or yogurt from 2003 to present can go to www.boughtmilk.com and fill out a brief settlement claim form. No receipts are required. Claims must be filed by Jan. 31.
