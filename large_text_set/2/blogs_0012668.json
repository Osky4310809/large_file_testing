We applaud the progress the people of Kosovo have made in developing democratic, multiethnic institutions over their nine years of independence. In 2016, the United States was pleased to witness Kosovo’s first Olympic gold medal and Kosovo’s national football team play its inaugural year in FIFA. We look forward to Kosovo’s continued achievements as it works to strengthen rule of law, counter violent extremism, and build positive relationships with its neighbors and around the world. \nThe United States remains committed to helping Kosovo succeed, and we will continue to work with its leaders and people in the pursuit of peace and prosperity.
