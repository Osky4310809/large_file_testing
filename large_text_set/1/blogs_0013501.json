CHARLES COUNTY • A man was critically injured when he was trapped upside down for about 26 hours in a 20-inch-wide pipe at a home construction site near New Melle, authorities said. \nLeo Lyke, 47, of Warren County, was rescued about 2 p.m. Thursday after the owners of the yet-to-be-built home stopped by and heard him yelling, said Chief Rick Massey of the New Melle Fire Protection District. \nFirefighters pulled him out of the pipe and he was taken by helicopter to Mercy Hospital St. Louis, in Creve Coeur. A hospital spokeswoman said he remained in critical condition Friday. \nMassey said Lyke, who is about six feet tall, was roughly four feet into the pipe to install an aerator as part of putting in a septic tank. \n\"He had gotten too far in; he could not push himself back out,\" Massey said. \"It was too far.\" \nLyke had been assigned by his employer, C.J. Concrete Products, of Warrenton, to do the work at the site, in the 3500 block of Becker Joerling Road. It is in a semi-rural area, about five miles southwest of New Melle. \nWilliam Gooch, the company's retired president, said Friday that Lyke carries a cellphone but had left it in his pickup truck parked about 100 feet away. \nGooch said he had never heard of such an accident in his many years in the septic tank business. \"It was a freak thing,\" Gooch said. \nHe said Lyke has worked for the firm for more than 15 years. \nA hospital spokeswoman wouldn't comment on the nature of Lyke's injuries. Massey, the fire chief, said he was told they were related to exposure and compartment syndrome, a muscle and nerve condition. \nGooch added that Lyke's body temperature had been low. He said his son, who now runs the company, was told that Lyke's condition had improved Friday although he remained in intensive care. \nGooch said Lyke is single and lives alone west of Warrenton. He said the company became concerned when Lyke didn't show up for work Thursday morning. \n\"My son went to his house and couldn't find any sign of him,\" Gooch said. \"We started backtracking to see where he possibly was. The last place we could find was a UPS store in Wentzville\" where he had been Wednesday. \nGooch said Lyke managed his own workload, so others did not know where he would be at a given time. \nMassey, the fire chief, said Lyke was wearing shorts amid unseasonably warm temperatures Wednesday, when he arrived to do the work on the septic tank. \nSt. Louis area temperatures reached into the 60s and low 70s that afternoon. The temperature dropped into the 40s Wednesday night and the 30s by Thursday morning. \nGooch said Lyke is very strong and regularly exercises and lifts weights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T23:22:37.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
