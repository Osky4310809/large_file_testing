But for now, a new statement from the American Heart Association is in favor of eating breakfast as a way to promote better health . And don’t just eat it, they say—eat it mindfully. Focusing on eating at planned intervals can help you work toward a healthier lifestyle and lower your heart disease risk factors, the experts say. \nStudy the Brain Scientists at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center just discovered a new way to grow cortical neurons —nerve cells in the brain—in just 10 days. Previously, researchers had to wait months. This allows them to better model central nervous system-related diseases, like schizophrenia and autism, potentially paving the way for better treatments. \nGet Your Kids Moving The mental benefits of exercise aren’t just for adults— kids can get a mood boost, too .

The physical activity that’s beneficial is the kind that leaves kids a little sweaty and breathless, they say. \nRe-Think Your E-Cigs It’s not just regular cigarettes that can be a health risk: E-cigarettes may raise your risk of heart problems , too, new research in JAMA Cardiology found. The scientists discovered that people who regularly smoked e-cigs had certain biomarkers associated with heart disease, including oxidative stress and heart rate variability.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:55:50.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
