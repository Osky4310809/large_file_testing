The two players have a long history together, and because the world’s sometimes a funny place, they matched up head-to-head in the national championship game. \nA decade before Villanova and UNC met in the title game, Britt’s family took Jenkins into its home and adopted him. Nate Britt knew Jenkins through basketball, and when Jenkins’ mother was struggling and wanted her son to have a better life, the Britts adopted him. Jenkins has stayed close with his birth mother, who watched the Final Four in person last March. It’s a remarkable and heartwarming story . \nBritt and Jenkins are legally brothers, even though they’re not related by blood. When the matchup came about in the Final Four last year, Jenkins called it “something our families could cherish forever.” An added twist: Jenkins became the game’s hero, when he hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer that won the championship for Villanova. \nJenkins’ moment meant heartbreak for Britt’s North Carolina. But it didn’t drive the two apart. There’s nothing to suggest the two have done anything other than keep rooting for each other in its wake. \nThis year has been the senior season for both Jenkins and Britt. Both of their teams were No. 1 seeds. Villanova suffered a second-round upset against Wisconsin, while North Carolina’s made it (so far) to the Elite Eight. The two aren’t going head-to-head again, but Jenkins was on hand Friday night to support Britt and his team.\nCBS That there are bigger things than sports is probably the single oldest adage about sports. It’s easy to say out loud, but Jenkins and Britt have lived it. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T03:20:11.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
