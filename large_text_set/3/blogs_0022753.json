Inspired by yoga, gymnastics, mixed martial arts, and even Parkour, “street workouts” are a string of explosive bodyweight exercises that are done on bars, benches, playground equipment, and even trees. Fueled by social media, the vibrant culture has rapidly expanded into the mainstream. Once deemed an underground fitness movement, street workouts have moved beyond the parks to global stadiums.

At the time, I was teaching boot camp classes and boxing, and I was always looking for new things to add to my class. I started seeing the Bartendaz and teams in New York doing these crazy workouts, but what caught my eye is that it looked, to me, like boxing or what I loved about boxing, meaning this shifting of body weight from explosive to smooth and controlled. It was rhythmic, like I boxed, and it looked like an art form. I started implementing those types of workouts into my class. I started following the Bartendaz and I realized they were more than just a fitness thing—it was a social movement.” \nWhat makes this sport so unique? Why do you think people are so drawn to it? \n“This is as inclusive as you can get, meaning that absolutely anyone can do it. It breaks down all barriers: Age, gender, race, sexuality, nationality, and most importantly, socioeconomic barriers. This spoke to underprivileged people most of all. Freestyle calisthenics grew in popularity because literally anyone can do it. It’s your own bodyweight. \nNow, how that translates to the park and what makes it so different is that it puts people together. It puts convicts with police officers, it puts blue collar with white collar, it puts male with female, gay with straight. Around the bar, everyone socializes. It’s more than just fitness: People take control of their bodies, but the real effect comes in to place when people start taking control over their lives. In some of these championships, we’ve had people side by side that were countries at arms, but on the competitive stage they’re like brothers, and it’s the most beautiful thing in the world to witness.” \nExtreme calisthenics started as an underground fitness movement, but it’s quickly become an international sport. Do you think the heart of this movement will change as it continues to grow and gain recognition? \n“That is the question that the movie asks, but time will only tell. Everyone wants this to evolve. Most people want it to be big because they want to be able to make a living doing something that they love. What people get worried about—myself included—is that it will get more commercial and more mainstream. \nI think at the end of the day, if we can maintain the heart and soul of the culture, which is bettering one’s self and bettering someone else, I think that’s going to keep the culture alive. The culture is not going to go anywhere; there are always going to be people that want to do this and it is only going to get bigger. The sport, that’s where the question mark is, because it’s really hard to standardize. You can’t have something as loosely defined as freestyle calisthenics is right now, so it’s going to be interesting to see how it goes.” \nWhat do you think these global competitions look and feel like compared to what you would see people doing in the parks in New York? \n“The love of the game, sport, and culture translates from the street to the stadium. One of the most unique things that I’ve seen in this culture as it is now, is that I’ve never seen a competition where you are legitimately, sincerely cheering on your competitor and losing your mind when they do well. In this, if your competitor hits a badass move, and you’re waiting for your turn for the one-on-one battle, you’re cheering just as loudly as his team. There’s this genuine love, even in the competitive element. \nYou do, however, have a lot of people that like different styles, and I think that’s how what’s done in the parks and what’s done in competition can differ. The competition is for the public. You do things for flair. I think some people don’t like that competitions are less about strength and more about show, but they have to be in some sense because you’re giving a performance.” \nAfter spending some time with the people within this community, how have you seen this sport impact their lives? \n“It depends on where they come from, but so many people in our movie and in this culture are success stories. I don’t know that there’s a sports culture out there that does so much for people’s lives, in terms of getting them out of gangs, getting them off drugs, out of jail. I’m sure basketball has saved someone’s life—I don’t doubt that for a second, but I don’t need a court to go do freestyle calisthenics. I don’t need a basketball to go do this. I don’t need to be a member of the YMCA to go do this. I can go to any park right now. Hell, I can go to the tree that I’m looking at outside my house and start doing pullups. I don’t know why, but it is insane how freestyle calisthenics transforms the confidence, mentality, and spirituality of the people that participate in it.” \nWhat do you hope your audience will take away from the film and how do you think it will change the way they perceive the freestyle calisthenics community? \n“My first goal is to tell this story because it hasn’t been told on the mainstream format. Because I am a part of this culture, and I practice it, and I live this, and love this, I want to introduce this to the world. This was something that was happening on the underground for so long; it wasn’t until the past few years that this starting showing up on mainstream fitness channels, and the look has changed a lot. The stars have changed a lot. A lot of the people that the film focuses on are the pioneers and the legends of this movement. The top stars today? Their inspiration is who our movie is about. \nAlso, as a trainer myself, and as someone who’s traveled the world and seen how this affects children all over the world, I hope people see this and think: “Hey, I can do this. This isn’t just something for super athletes.” It’s not—and has never been—about being a super athlete. It’s about taking care of your mind, body, and soul.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:02:02.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
