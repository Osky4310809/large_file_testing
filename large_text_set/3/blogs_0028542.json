He (or she!) probably lives nearby. They are no bigger than the standard dimensions of the Porta-Potty—44 inches wide and 88 inches tall. As one clever redditor pointed out, we can also deduce that the mystery person either has use of their hands or found some other way of switching the latch to “occupied.” \nSo, who could it be? Is it Harry Styles? Is it some sort of plumber? The jury’s still out, and there’s a small vocal subset of users who have made a convincing argument that the occupant could be an old man or a very short woman! \nOne thing’s for sure: As long as this remains a mystery, there’s no way we’re getting any work done.
