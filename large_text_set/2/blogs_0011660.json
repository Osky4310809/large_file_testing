(Photo: Hilary Bronwyn Gayle, HBO) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAs the women connect in Big Little Lies , so have the five actresses who play them in HBO's miniseries (Sunday, 9 ET/PT). \nIt’s the kind of on-set bonding opportunity that was rare until recently, for one simple reason: There weren't many female ensembles in Hollywood. \n“Are you kidding? None of us did movies together, because there was just one of us, with like six guys. Maybe there were two female roles,” says Laura Dern, Murder roils oceanfront town in HBO's 'Big Little Lies' \nReese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, also executive producers of the project, say the limited-series format gave them an opportunity to delve more deeply into multiple characters than they could in a feature film. \nA look at the actresses behind the series: \n\nReese Witherspoon, 40 ( Wild , Walk the Line ) \nCharacter: Madeline Martha Mackenzie, a sharp-tongued, big-hearted woman always looking for a cause. She's on her second marriage, with a daughter from each union. \nWitherspoon, who worked with Lies director Jean-Marc Vallée on Wild , says she celebrated her birthday during filming, \"and all the women took me out to dinner.\" Getting together off set \"was a great opportunity to share life beyond the (acting) parts. We’ve had so many common life experiences because of what we do and where we live,” she says. “Nicole, Laura and I have done this for many years and Shailene and Zoe are young women who have incredible talent. It’s exciting to see them on their journey.” \n\nNicole Kidman, 49 ( Lion , The Hours ) \nCharacter: Celeste Wright, the mother of twin boys whose marriage to a handsome businessman (Alexander Skarsgård) appears to create a perfect picture of affluent wedded bliss. \nProducing provides the chance to champion programs such as Lies , creating more acting opportunities for women. “As an actor, a lot of times your destiny is controlled by what you get offered, so it’s nice if you can create your own opportunities,” she says. \n\nShailene Woodley, 25 ( Divergent , The Fault in Our Stars ) \nCharacter: Jane Chapman, a twentysomething single mom with an unknown past, who arrives in Monterey seeking a quality education for her son. \nWoodley checked in with Fault co-star Dern before taking the role. “To work with a cast of empathetic and compassionate women who are true champions of other women and a male director who was approaching this from a matriarchal point of view was really special.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:27:37.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
