O'keefe's three wicket over 2:02 \nSoon were working together again, for a two-day session at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane. \nWe worked on lots of simple things: working out how to change your angles and strategy mid-match, giving him some little pointers on how to tweak the way he bowls in Australian conditions. \nAnd I remember saying I felt he will have the most impact in India because of how I saw him make adjustments from Manly to the pitch in Brisbane. \nIn the space of a week, he convinced me that he could be Steve Smith’s secret weapon. \n“Your biggest challenge,” I told Steve, “is going to be when you’re playing the Test match, you will have to adapt on the spot. \n“You’ll have to change at that time. I don’t want you to do it at lunch or tea. \n“It has to happen immediately. Go to point and have a think. If this ends not working, go to the other end.” \nAnd that is what gave me the most pleasure out of watching him bowl in Pune: after a few tough spells, he readjusted. \nHe switched ends, changed up his length and Indian had no answer. \nHe bowled fuller, got more confident, bowled with more side spin and walked away with 12 wickets. \nWe’re staying in regular contact while Steve is in India and my message to him is to close the book on this Test, because Australia have the potential to win this series. 'We fielded well' 1:07 \nIndia are a very unpredictable side on the subcontinent. \nWhen England won the second Test in Mumbai on our 2012 tour, setting up a drought-breaking series win, we were given great confidence. \nAnd that’s great, of course. But you also know that India is not a place to get overconfident. \nThey will assess the conditions and the next Test match I won’t be surprised if they produce a flatter deck. \nI know Pune is more likely to produce turning wickets than some other decks in India, but I was still surprised they didn’t try to prepare a flat deck. \nIf you have an experienced spinner coming in like Nathan Lyon or O’Keefe , they’re going to exploit those conditions - as they did very well. \nIf they want to produce a turning deck, do it against an opposition that have an inexperienced spin attack – not like Australia’s. \nI expect India will produce a flatter deck for the next Test in Bangalore, starting on Saturday. \nIf Australia can adjust to those conditions and dominate, then we’re talking. \nThen we could be thinking ‘Australia have the potential to win the series’. \nIf it’s a flatter deck, India could be a dangerous team because they will dictate. \nThey know how to play on those pitches, they’ll accelerate and I don’t know how Australia will react to that. \nSundar O’Keefe, Sundar India.
