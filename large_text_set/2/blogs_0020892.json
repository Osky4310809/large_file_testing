Unfortunately, you're wrong. Microsoft, in collaboration with the University of Cambridge, is developing such an AI. This software \" can turn your descriptions into working code in seconds ,\" reports MSPoweruser. \"Called DeepCoder, the software can take requirements by the developer, search through a massive database of code snippets and deliver working code in seconds, a significant advance in the state of the art in program synthesis.\" New Scientist describes program synthesis as \"creating new programs by piecing together lines of code taken from existing software -- just like a programmer might. Given a list of inputs and outputs for each code fragment, DeepCoder learned which pieces of code were needed to achieve the desired result overall.\" The original research paper can be read here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:39:14.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
