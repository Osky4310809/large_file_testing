John McCain (R-AZ). Clapper would not say if such an effort constituted an act of war, nor would he say what impact the actual alleged hacking efforts had on last November’s presidential election outcome.

And so really, what we’re talking about, is if they succeeded in changing the results of an election of which none of us believe they were, that would have to constitute an attack on the United States of America because of the effects, if they had succeeded, would you agree with that?

MCCAIN: Yeah, I’m just talking about… (CROSSTALK) CLAPPER: And we have no — we have no way of gauging the impact that — certainly the intelligence community can’t gauge the — the impact it had on the choices the electorate made. There’s no way for us to gauge that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T03:34:54.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
