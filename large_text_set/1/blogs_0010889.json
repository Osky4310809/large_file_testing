Both parties have a challenge. I think the president will prove to be authoritarian… You will see a horrendous abuse of power by this government. I think it’s good to hope for the best but we need to expect and prepare for the very worst.” \nHe added: “I think Trump is much worse than people understand… I think we’re on the verge of a kleptocracy.” \nJones has emerged as one of the leading voices calling out Trump’s contradictions and conflicts in the post-election media landscape. His comments on election night that the result was a “white-lash” caused a sensation.

Many in the room were Oscar voters. \nBut the conversation turned mainly around the coming Trump administration, and how people who oppose him should respond. While Jones argued that it was important for the Democratic Party to understand and embrace the disaffected Trump voters suffering from economic stagnation and job loss, Duvernay said she was deeply pained by the idea that so many had voted for a candidate she considers racist, violent and homophobic. \n“I don’t have a lot of empathy for someone who can raise their hand for violence,” she said. Trying to “understand” Trump voters is a distraction from her focus on her work, she said. \n“The distraction of trying to educate and love this side is what will diminish me,” she said. “How am I going to stay centered ? What will I do? I need to stay focused on my goals. What I’m going to try to do to get through these four years is to get enlarged, and to do that will take all my focus.” \nWinfrey mainly asked questions, but the tenor of the conversation made clear yet again that the Hollywood community is dreading the arrival of Donald Trump to the presidency. If Jones is correct, they have ample reason. \nRead original story Van Jones Predicts ‘Horrendous Abuse of Power’ Under Trump At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.
