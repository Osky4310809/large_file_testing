LOUIS • The St. Louis Police Department has two main strategies to better deter and solve crimes plaguing the city and hurting its national image: Add police officers and expand surveillance technology. \nThis was made clear by Chief Sam Dotson in an announcement March 9 inside the police department’s Real Time Crime Center. Soulard, a historic neighborhood filled with bars and restaurants and year-round events that pull in thousands of visitors, was getting 16 state-of-the-art surveillance cameras that will tie directly into the center’s expansive wall of television screens and banks of computers. \nThe purchase was praised as an example of a public-private cooperation. \nWith the cameras, police will be able to monitor areas of Soulard day and night, particularly areas around restaurants and shops. Some cameras can track license plate numbers to help solve crimes. \nCity police have about 500 cameras overall in the system. Since June 2015, police say, the cameras have resulted in 283 arrests and 787 separate charges, and the recovery of 28 illegal firearms and 132 stolen vehicles. \nBut an aerial map of the city displaying the camera networks highlighted a stark disparity between wealthier neighborhoods and poorer ones that are most afflicted by serious crimes and shootings. \nDistinct clusters of cameras exist in the downtown area, on South Grand Boulevard near its retail corridor, on the blossoming city side of the Loop and in the city’s popular Central West End. Yet higher crime areas such as Walnut Park had just two, and many others, such as the Wells-Goodfellow neighborhood, which has had 51 homicides in the last five years — more than any other city neighborhood during that period — had none. \nIt’s a picture that has Alderman Cara Spencer and other community leaders broiling. Spencer’s 20th Ward, which includes part of Dutchtown and Gravois Park, has no cameras despite several murders and a high crime rate near a park with playgrounds. They include a double homicide last summer. \n“Why haven’t we made it a priority to have a citywide approach to crime?” Spencer asked. “What we really need is leadership at the top to say, ‘This is where the crime is happening and we need the cameras, and it’s important to direct the aldermen to work together in this way.’” \nAt least one local expert suggests the disparity of cameras is based in structural or institutional racism. He said the areas not getting cameras are primarily poor and African-American and don’t have the resources and private partnerships with business or nonprofits to pay for them. \n“We shouldn’t criticize Soulard for doing what they’re doing to protect the neighborhood, or if the Central West End furthers secures itself with bringing on off-time police officers on bikes,” said Todd Swanstrom, University of Missouri-St. Louis professor of community collaboration and and public policy. “But as we move from public to private funding, public goods like police protection are no longer provided equally to everyone.” \nDotson said there was no way St. Louis police could afford to buy the pricey surveillance cameras on the department’s $180 million budget. He said the equipment needed to be purchased and maintained through public-private partnerships. That’s how Chicago, with more than 10,000 cameras citywide, does it, he said. \nMore money for cameras could be available if voters approve Proposition 1, an April ballot measure for a .5 percent sales tax to pay for a variety of things, including public safety. That money could be used for cameras, though hiring of police officers is a priority. \nDotson said Soulard was the perfect example of how a public-private partnership works. \nSoulard’s Alderman Jack Coatar appropriated $110,000 in 7th Ward money toward the cameras after the St. Louis Mardi Gras Foundation raised $23,000 in seed money through its annual Mayor’s Ball at City Hall. That was supplemented by more than $60,000 from the Soulard Restoration Group, Soulard Business Association and Soulard Special Business District, along with two popular restaurants. \nAltogether, about $200,000 was raised. \nThat dollar figure makes Spencer — who recently purchased and installed her own stop sign near a school because of delays caused by city red tape — scoff and swear. \n“I have nothing in my area. I have a business district, Cherokee Street, but we don’t have a CID [Community Improvement District]. I have a hospital [St. Alexius] struggling, I have a neighborhood in poverty. We don’t have Mardi Gras Inc. with their millions to put in.” \nMany neighborhoods struggle with similar issues, but her area speaks to how difficult it is for leaders in 28 wards with overlapping neighborhoods to buy and install cameras when they are competing for money and have so many infrastructure needs. \nSpencer said the money she had to spend on ward improvements didn’t go far when she was dealing with crumbling alleyways and streets. Paving one street is going to cost $100,000. And violent crimes soared in and around Gravois Park last year, deterring people from using it. \nShe has tried to purchase surveillance cameras for the Gravois Park area but complains that police are not providing any guidance. \n“I had to hire a consulting company to give me a quote for what the cameras cost. The city is not doing any of this work internally,” she said. “I want a recommendation. Where does the police department recommend I put these cameras? — and I don’t have that.” \nFurthermore, she said, she got estimates of about $200,000 to buy four cameras while Soulard is getting 16 for the same amount of money. \n“It’s not being done in a way that is feasible,” she said. \nIn January, Carl Filler, director of strategic policy initiatives in the mayor’s office, pledged to get cameras into the Gravois Park area. \nThe push for cameras comes at a time when aldermen representing some of the most crime-ridden neighborhoods complain that a city plan to fight crime rolled out more than two years ago has been slow going, has not provided them with more resources and has had minimal impact. That targeted 15 high-crime neighborhoods, including Gravois Park and Wells-Goodfellow. \nTwo years since that initiative and nearly two years since the Real Time Crime Center began operating, Wells-Goodfellow still has no cameras. The neighborhood’s alderman, Jeffrey Boyd, said he had saved about $500,000 in aldermanic funds and hoped to see eight to 12 cameras installed this summer. But that expenditure takes away from other vitally needed projects in the area, he said. \nPolice would not release a list showing where all the cameras are situated, citing security concerns. \nAlderman Sam Moore, 4th Ward, who oversees The Ville and Greater Ville neighborhoods, said it took him several years to save enough discretionary funds from the city to purchase four cameras last year for $200,000. \nHe said that he still had limited police patrols in the area and that the cameras had been relatively ineffective. One of them was placed in the wrong ward and peers down the street in the wrong direction. Another street he wanted to target with a camera lacked the appropriate electricity source. A third has limited visibility in the direction of the drug dealing he wanted to curb because of an overgrown lot that was not cleared. He said the situation was a disgrace. \nSwanstrom, the city policy expert at UMSL, said the city ultimately needed to invest in creating civic groups in every neighborhood that can drive change. \n“This is a serious issue, and I think one of the ways to address it is to invest in a civic infrastructure. Not just in police cameras, but to invest in community organizations. I think it’s not just a question of private sector wealth, but whether you have the civic organizations,” he said.
