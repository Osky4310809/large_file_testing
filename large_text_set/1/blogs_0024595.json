LOLz!!\nAnd now, it looks like Uber is going to pay for it — HARD.\nFirst, it came in the form of a very public boycott of the company on social media, just some of which you can see (below):\nUber CEO vs Lyft CEO #deleteuber pic.twitter.com/4o8SVydOWP\n— k (@moisturizeds) January 29, 2017\nI switched from @Uber to @Lyft a while ago!! #DeleteUber https://t.co/SYD947Vn3C\n— Perez (@ThePerezHilton) January 29, 2017\nHey @Uber my favorite part of today was deleting my UBER account and signing up for @lyft #notmyliberalpennies #girlbye #deleteuber\n— Sam Saboura (@SamStyles) January 29, 2017\nSupport #lyft for supporting American values. #deleteuber\n— Nina Sadowsky (@sadowsky_nina) January 29, 2017\nI used to drive for uber.

Banning people of a particular faith or creed, race or identity, sexuality or ethnicity, from entering the U.S. is antithetical to both Lyft's and our nation's core values. We stand firmly against these actions, and will not be silent on issues that threaten the values of our community.\n\"We know this directly impacts many of our community members, their families, and friends. We stand with you, and are donating $1,000,000 over the next four years to the ACLU to defend our constitution. We ask that you continue to be there for each other - and together, continue proving the power of community.\nJohn & Logan\nLyft Co-Founders\"\nIncredible!!!\nThat is a ONE MILLION DOLLAR donation from the Lyft folks over the course of four years — a truly impressive achievement!
