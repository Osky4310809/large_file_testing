Here he is, already attempting to once again bend the cosmos to his bidding by making out with one-time Spider-Man Andrew Garfield at the Golden Globes. \nTake a look and just try to tell us Reynolds doesn’t know exactly what he’s doing in reference to the pairing of he and Garfield’s fictional heroes: OH MY GOD RYAN REYNOLDS AND ANDREW GARFIELD KISSING IN THE BACKGROUND LMFAOOO IM BLAKE LIVELY SITTING THERE CLAPPING pic.twitter.com/DLAfYfaRGq \nSo uh … safe to say we’re getting a Spideypool movie at some point, even if it takes Reynolds a decade or more? OK, maybe not (disappointing), but fans across the Internet are definitely happy about the nod.  stexvebucky: Spideypool is canon https://t.co/pseAsuA0aE \n— Kiashii Talmadge (@kiashii) January 9, 2017 @VancityReynolds YOU ARE THE BEST, I LOVE U. #SPIDEYPOOL pic.twitter.com/pqn6Qd9nBC \n— Diann Vega♡ (@diannv94) January 9, 2017 Face à spideypool j’suis pic.twitter.com/JJRu7Suke6", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:02:34.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
