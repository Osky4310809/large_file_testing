He was 82. (Torrie, Keith) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   4:45 PM \nDallas Green, the blustery baseball lifer who managed the Phillies to the 1980 World Series championship before later also skippering both the Yankees and the Mets, has died. He was 82. \nGreen’s death was confirmed by the Phillies, who signed him as a high school pitcher out of Delaware in 1955. He spent much of the next six decades working in various capacities in baseball -- as a player, coach, manager, general manager, scout and other front-office positions. \nHe managed the Yankees for 121 games in 1989, going 56-65 while often clashing with George Steinbrenner – who he famously dubbed “Manager George” for the owner’s constant meddling – before he was fired on Aug. 21 and replaced by Bucky Dent. \n“I don't think it was any secret we're both strong-willed,” Green said that day. “I've always said let the chips fall where they may -- it's just that sometimes they fall badly.” \nLegendary former Bulls GM Jerry Krause dead at 77 \nGreen resurfaced a few years later in Flushing, managing the Mets to a 229-283 mark from 1993 until Aug. of 1996, when he was canned and replaced by Bobby Valentine. Green was one of four men to manage both the Yankees and the Mets, along with Casey Stengel, Yogi Berra and Joe Torre. Dallas Green (AP) \nIn 2011, Green’s nine-year-old granddaughter, Christina Taylor-Green was one of six people killed in the Tucson shooting that critically wounded U.S. Representative from Arizona Gabrielle Giffords. \n“They say time heals,” Green said in 2013. “Time, I don’t think, will ever heal that part of my life. I still tear up when I see something that reminds me of Christina.” \nLater in life, he became an advocate for gun control, and expressed disappointment when the U.S. Senate failed to take steps to expand such laws. \n“Washington is such a mess that they really can’t agree on anything,” Green said. “I think this is part of it. I understand the Second Amendment; I just struggle to understand how a Glock and how an AK-47 and all these high-magazine guns fit into our forefathers’ thoughts. They had one shot at a time and had five minutes to reload. These guys are running around shooting up 50 or 60 people at a time.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:10:12.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
