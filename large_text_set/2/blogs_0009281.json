A month before we start leaving the EU, the party is riding high. It is close to making real the dream of Brexit, Theresa May has an unassailable poll lead and the Labour Party seems determined to become a national laughing stock.\nThis is, of course, precisely when complacency sets in. The country seems to be so firmly behind the Prime Minister that even Parliament is falling into line.\nAfter sniffing the electoral winds, MPs abandoned any idea of a Brexit rebellion . With Mrs May in such a strong position, even the House of Lords will find it uncomfortable to defy her.\nA word of caution, however. This show of strength has shallow roots and it would be foolish to mistake the electorate’s hard-headedness for deep-seated conservatism.\nWatch | Jeremy Corbyn: Rumours of quitting are 'nonsense' 00:19 V oters support May because they take one look at Jeremy Corbyn and see a total shambles. He is the Tories’ biggest electoral asset, but at some point he will leave the scene.\nWhen he does, many on the Right will be shocked to discover an uncomfortable fact. Much of Britain is solidly Left-wing and popular support for a Conservative economic platform is low.\nIf Conservatives want to change that, the time to act is now. Mrs May understands this truth. With an unerring instinct for power, her first move as Prime Minister was to grab Labour territory. She announced that she would represent the working poor by implementing a “proper industrial strategy”, smashing fat cats and shunning the “libertarian right”.\nHer promises raised eyebrows among Westminster Tories. This was, after all, the Ed Miliband playbook, and look what happened to him.\nEd Miliband, the former Labour leader Credit: PA Wire I t’s true that Labour lost in 2015 because it was seen as clueless and irresponsible. But we on the Right must be brutally honest: Mr Miliband might have been an ineffective advocate for his policies, but many of them are deeply popular.\nTake nationalisation, for example. The summer after Mr Miliband lost, YouGov polled the popularity of “radical” Left-wing policies. The data suggested that 58 per cent of Britons would like to nationalise the railways, water supply and other utilities.\nPolls are unanimous: support for extensive state ownership is a mainstream view in Britain. The evidence is similar for other Left-wing ideas.\nFurther rises in the minimum wage, whacking up taxes on the rich, taxing mansions, even putting workers on company boards: they might make many Tories shudder, but, given a credible leader to implement such policies, most voters would say, “Yes, please.”\nThe Conservatives have a window of opportunity to head off a disastrous, hard-Leftist revival. They must seize it I f you doubt survey evidence, trust instead a general reading of the public mood. Britain is a country in which even small changes to the provision of public health services generate rage. It’s not just policies, either.\nThe language of the Left has won over the soul of our politics – and the Brexit campaign, staring this fact in the face, used it to win.\nWhen else, for example, would you ever have seen leading Conservative politicians lambasting elites, business leaders and experts as “out of touch”? When, in our history, has it been common for senior Tories to carp about their opponents’ wealth, expensive clothes and social connections? They do it, however, because they can read the mood. Sounding Left-wing works.\nIf all of this is true, one salient question remains. Why is Labour failing so spectacularly to capitalise on it? Its problem is that the party is stuck in the cul-de-sac of identity politics and irrelevant social theory. No one better encapsulates that problem than Mr Corbyn.\nHe’d rather talk to voters about the affinity between Muslims and Marx’s proletariat than about jobs and housing. He thinks the way Donald Trump talks about women is more important than whether he’ll give us a trade deal.\nWatch | Corbyn: Trump's UK state visit should be put on-hold 00:44 H e prefers to theorise about the political process than master the method. And then there’s the really toxic part of the Islington-Hackney platform.\nWhat sickens natural Labour supporters about Mr Corbyn is his fervent internationalism, which they see as unpatriotic, and his hatred of strong national defence, which they see as dangerous.\nDenouncing the West’s evils, hobnobbing with IRA and Hamas sympathisers, arguing for unconstrained immigration, nuclear disarmament and the prosecution of British soldiers: these are the things killing Labour in its heartlands.\nThe danger for the Tories is that at some point, the Left will wake up to this reality. That doesn’t mean installing a second Blair – the heady days suited for Blairism are long gone – but rather, choosing a patriotic class warrior.\nSuch a candidate would pose a formidable challenge to the Right. There is no one obviously ready to fill this role. It needn’t be done by Labour. Ukip could step into the breach – a nasty shock for all the Thatcherite Tories who flocked to its banner – but it takes a lot to replace the sense of empathy that voters feel for Labour.\nOn the other hand, Labour’s mooted successor for Corbyn, Clive Lewis, quit his shadow cabinet role last week in protest at Brexit. That will hardly endear him to the patriotic working classes.\nProfile | Clive Lewis T he circumstances suggest, however, that it is merely a matter of time. That is why Corbyn and his advisers talk mystifyingly about “building a progressive movement” and think, apparently ludicrously, that “the real fight starts now”.\nThey have no idea how to harness them, but can see that long-term trends – slow wage growth and high living costs – are moving in their favour.\nMrs May was savvy in stealing the language of the Left and, I suspect, feels more comfortable with it in her heart than with pro-business rhetoric.\nUltimately, though, Tory governments are judged on results. If productivity and wages don’t rise and if millions of homes aren’t built to bring voters’ aspirations within reach, they will look elsewhere.\nIf we don’t get a decent Brexit deal and are forced into a painfully sharp restructuring of the economy, Leftist ideas will find even more fertile ground.\nIt doesn’t yet feel like it, but these are dangerous times. The Conservatives have a window of opportunity to head off a disastrous, hard-Leftist revival. They must seize it.", "external_links": ["http://17909.cdx.c.ooyala.com/V2NzNrOTE6btKVjTE_imSxljVVIu9i7e/promo310909608"], "published": "2017-02-12T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:37:26.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
