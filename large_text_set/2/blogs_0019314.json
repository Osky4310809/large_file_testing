Blunt force trauma \nShe said: \"The pediment fell striking Ciaran on the top of his head causing him to fall backwards, as a result he sustained several head injuries.\" \nIt was heard that the pediment \"fell further and progressed down Ciaran's face causing him to sustain several abrasions\". \nThe document also said \"the pediment then landed on Ciaran's chest, shoulder and upper abdomen causing him to sustain the blunt force trauma injuries he suffered to his aorta and liver\". \nMiss Bain told the court: \"At the point Ciaran was struck by the pediment his death would have been instantaneous and painless for him.\" \nThe inquiry aims to establish if there were any reasonable precautions that could have prevented the tragedy. \nIt will also consider if there were any defects in the system of work that caused or contributed to Ciaran's death. Image copyright Google Image caption Stonemason Peter Hayman said he would have fenced the gravestone off because it was unstable \nEarlier expert stonemason Peter Hayman told the court that \"very little force\" would have been enough to topple the headstone. \nHe said a nearby tree's roots forced the memorial to lean forward but concluded \"if left without any remedial action it would have eventually failed at some point\". \nHe said the angle of lean on the stone was between eight and eight and a half degrees. \nDorothy Bain QC - representing Ciaran's mother Stephanie Griffin - asked Mr Hayman if he had visited before the incident, what risk he thought the stone would present. \nThe witness said that if it was leaning at the angle it was recorded at it \"would be a definite hazard and danger\". \nHe told the hearing that he would still assess the particular stone as a potential danger if the angle of lean was about six degrees. \nMiss Bain asked what he meant by \"very little force\" and he said: \"Perhaps even a strong gust of wind.\" Fenced off \nHe added: \"Ground heave, frost and thaw actions.\" \nShe asked: \"If you had been asked to inspect the Ross memorial before the failure, would you have passed it as safe?\" Mr Hayman said \"No.\" \nMiss Bain asked: \"Would would you have done?\" He replied: \"I would have immediately fenced it off.\" \nMr Hayman said he was disappointed at the condition of some of the headstones at Craigton Cemetery. \nIt was heard that he had contacted the council to suggest an inspection and maintenance programme. \nUnder cross-examination by Mark Stewart QC, representing Glasgow City Council, Mr Hayman was asked whether he meant that the headstone was \"so perilously balanced a gust of wind would knock it over?\" He replied that he did not. \nThe inquiry before sheriff Linda Ruxton continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:59:50.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
