By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 22, 2017 7:22 PM Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar with Chinese Executive Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui at the upgraded India-China strategic dialogue in Beijing. (PTI) \nFollowing extensive interactions with top Chinese officials and talks at the upgraded strategic dialogue, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar today said that on 1267 Committee sanctions on Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar, it has been pointed out that this was being pursued by other countries and not India alone. Seeking China’s support on the ban on the Mumbai terror attack mastermind, Jaishankar stated that other countries had been pressing this application and this shows broad international support and concern about Azhar’s activities. In strong reply to to China’s demand for ‘solid evidence’ for getting JeM chief Masood Azhar banned by the United Nations, Jaishankar stated that the extent of Azhar’s actions were ‘well-documented’ and the ‘burden of proof’ was not concerns and priorities on key issues. \n“On the issue of 1267 Committee’s sanctions on Masood Azhar, we again explained the rationale for that application and pointed out that this was really pursued by other countries, not by India alone,” Jaishankar said, referring to the US’ application backed by the UK and France this year to designate Azhar as a global terrorist. \nAlso Watch: \nOn the Chinese Foreign Ministry calling for “solid evidence” to get Azhar banned, Jaishankar said, “in the case of Azhar, Jaish itself is proscribed under 1267. So the proof is in (the) 1267 Committee action. In this case what he has done, extent of his actions are well-documented.” \nWhile briefing the media on his extensive interactions with his Chinese counterparts, Jaishankar said that the two countries had reviewed the entirety of relationship between India and China in regards to both bilateral side and international issues. Jaishankar stated that there were discussions on various issues like Afghanistan, multilateral diplomacy including counter-terror, bilateral relations & nuclear issues.
