Both artists have shared posts that show them posted up in a subway car with red faux-velvet seats, a sight anyone who's spent time in Abel's hometown knows far too well. \nWhile the two have not shared all too much information regarding the shoot, Future captioned his photo as \"Still Coming Out Strong,\" making it seem quite likely the setup is for the HNDRXX collab \"Coming Out Strong.\"Check out the photos below.
