Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham, will sponsor the bill. She announced her bill Thursday with Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who has made passing a bathroom bill one of his top priorities for the legislative session that kicks off Tuesday. \n\"Martin Luther King, Jr. said, 'Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.' This legislation, the Texas Privacy Act, that Sen. Kolkhorst is filing today, is unquestionably one of the things that matters. It's the right thing to do,\" Patrick said. \"We are on the right side of the issue. We are on the right side of history.\" No, MLK didn't really say that thing Dan Patrick said he did.

The laws have caused substantial political headaches for those states' leaders. Indiana's was amended after fears it would allow businesses to discriminate against the LGBT community, and just last month North Carolina's failed to be repealed in a special legislative session. \nBoth cost their states millions of dollars in lost business investment. \nTexas' bill, Senate Bill 6 , will affect cities, public schools and state agencies and will increase penalties for crimes only if they're committed in bathrooms or dressing rooms. Cities Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R- Brenham, shown taking the oath of office on Tuesday, Jan. 11, 2011. (Rodolfo Gonzalez/Austin American-Statesman) \nIf passed into law, the bathroom bill would prohibit cities from passing any ordinance that requires private business to implement specific rules for bathroom, locker room and shower use. It also bans local leaders looking to award a government contract from considering a business' bathroom policies. \nCities like Dallas that have passed local laws allowing transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity would be kept from enforcing them. Austin, which requires retailers to ensure there is at least one gender-neutral restroom on site, would also be kept from enforcing this ordinance if Kolkhorst's bill passes. \nBut it is unclear how this would affect cities that have passed broadly worded anti-discrimination laws that protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. If a city bans discrimination in public accommodations - which includes public transport, retail businesses and restaurants - based on gender identity, would cities have to amend or repeal their ordinances, or would the whole thing simply be unenforceable under Kolkhorst's bill? \nWhen asked Thursday how his bill would affect local non-discrimination ordinances, Patrick simply said, \"This bill stops local cities, local governments from passing policies that allow men in women's restrooms.\" Schools \nAlso according to Texas' proposed bathroom bill, students, staff members and those using shared bathrooms in public schools and any local or state government buildings would be able to use only the facilities that correspond to their \"biological sex.\" If this rule is broken, they could be subject to a civil fine of at least $1,000 per offense, imposed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Criminal penalties \nFinally, certain criminal penalties would be increased by one degree -- but only \"if the offense was committed on the premises of a bathroom or changing facility.\" The increased penalty would apply to a host of crimes, including harassment, assault, prostitution, indecent exposure and murder. \nChuck Smith, head of the LGBT rights group Equality Texas, was in the Senate viewing gallery after the announcement Thursday. He told The Dallas Morning News the bill encourages people to \"ignore the existence of transgender people and hurt their ability to participate in public life.\" \n\"What was described sounds very much like North Carolina's House Bill 2,\" Smith said. \"Clearly, the lieutenant governor and Sen. Kolkhorst are not giving any credence to the damage that has caused in North Carolina, and they're willfully taking Texas down the same path.\" \nIn North Carolina, PayPal and Deutsche Bank stopped planned expansions in the state, and the city of Charlotte estimates it lost $130 million when two major sporting events were pulled after HB2's passage. Indiana's bill cost its capital city at least $60 million in lost revenue as of January 2016.
