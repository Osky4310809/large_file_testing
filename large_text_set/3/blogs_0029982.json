Highlights: Middlesbrough 1-3 Man Utd \n\"It was not so easy because the decision was a bit late so I couldn't say a proper goodbye to the team,\" Schweinsteiger said. \n\"Also they had a match away against - I can't remember - but they had a match on Sunday so I couldn't really tell them because I didn't want the focus on me, I wanted to have the focus on the team and the game. So I was very happy that they won. S'land vs Man Utd", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:01:33.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
