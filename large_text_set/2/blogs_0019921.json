Photo: iDropNews \nApple plans to increase the amount of storage offered on its premium iPhone model in 2017, according to the latest rumor out of Asia. \nLast year Apple finally killed off its measly 16GB baseline storage option with the iPhone 7. Now the company may be ready to give customers even more storage space with 64GB and 256GB. \nChinese research firm TechForce claims that contrary to previous rumors, the high-end 5.8-inch iPhone won’t feature a 3D curved display. Instead Apple will use the same 2.5D curved screen on the iPhone 7, but it still plans to pack in a bunch of new features to lure in customers. The Great iPhone 8 \nIt’s unclear if Apple will upgrade the storage options on all of the 2017 iPhones, or if the storage bump is just coming to the premium 5.8-inch models. TrendForce also claims Apple will use 3GB of RAM on the new model, just like on the iPhone 7 Plus. \nOther rumored features on the iPhone 8 include a new f acial scanning front camera , wireless charging , a bezel-free design with a Touch ID integrated into the display, and improved dual-lens cameras in the back. Apple isn’t expected to unveil the new iPhone until the second half of 2017, so there is still plenty of time for the all the rumors to be totally wrong. Production deals are still being worked out but TrendForce claims Apple will produce more than 100 million iPhone 8 units this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:06:13.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
