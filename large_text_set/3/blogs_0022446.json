Roman Reigns battled Braun Strowman in the main event but it was interference from The Undertaker that left fans buzzing. Even more interesting was The Big Dog's response to The Phenom's interruption of the main event. Triple H had words for Seth Rollins and issued him his one true opportunity to compete at WrestleMania, while Chris Jericho introduced the world to the \"real\" Kevin Owens during a special edition of The Highlight Reel. Mick Foley learned his fate as Raw general manager and Nia Jax had the opportunity to join Raw's Women's Championship match at WrestleMania. How did each of those stories play out when Raw hit the USA Network airwaves? Take a look for yourself. Stephanie McMahon Interrupts Mick Foley 2 of 11 Raw general manager Mick Foley kicked off this week's show to a sizable ovation, a prepared statement in his hand. Foley thanks his superiors, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon, for the opportunity they have given him. Continuing to read the statement, he admitted that he put that opportunity in jeopardy the moment he stuffed Mr. Socko in Triple H's mouth. To prevent any further issues, he decided to take a leave of absence from WWE. The fans booed the decision harshly to the point that Foley tore up the cue cards he was reading from and tossed them aside. His pride would not allow him to stand there and demean himself. This brought out Stephanie McMahon, who proceeded to verbally dress Foley down before firing him on live television. Sami Zayn hit the ring to defend Foley, telling his boss she should be ashamed of herself. Stephanie warned him to do the smart thing and leave the ring. Zayn refused, opting to do the right thing instead. For it, he got a match with Samoa Joe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T11:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T08:06:59.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
