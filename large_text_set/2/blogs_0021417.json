(CBS) – A 15-month-old died at a New Hampshire home that police are investigating as a possibly unlicensed daycare. \nAn ambulance was called to 131 Ash Street in Nashua on Wednesday afternoon, where a young boy was unconscious and not breathing. \nEMTs began CPR upon arrival, but the child was taken to an area hospital and did not survive. \nSeveral other children were in the building, known as The Kinder Garden, when firefighters and police arrived. They were checked out at hospitals as a precaution, but were all medically cleared. \nPolice later learned that the daycare may be operating without a license. \nNeighbors said not the first time there has been an incident at the house. \nNeighbor Wayne Andrews said he previously reported the daycare. \n“We had them shut down once. We called the state. They came in, saw they were running an illegal daycare, and they shut them down,” Andrews said. “A few weeks later they were taking care of kids again so I called the state again. The lady said ‘What do you want me to do, sit outside and count the kids?’” \nNashua Police said they have been in contact with the state’s Child Care Licensing Unit. \nAn autopsy was performed on the child, but the results have not yet been released.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T20:48:39.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
