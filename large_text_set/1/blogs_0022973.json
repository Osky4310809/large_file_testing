Trump hails US-UK 'special relationship' as May visits White House \nMr Trump's mother Mary MacLeod hailed from the Isle of Lewis. \nPronounced \"quake\", the cup's two handles are intended to signify trust on the part of the giver and the receiver. \nFirst Lady Melania Trump gave a pair of silver cufflinks by New York designer David Yurman to Mrs May's husband Philip. \nAnd she received a gift of a hamper of produce from the Prime Minister's country residence Chequers, including apple juice, damson jam and marmalade, as well as Bakewell tarts and cranberry and white chocolate \"shorties\".
