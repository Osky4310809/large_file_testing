It was confirmed to be her first ever visit to the city. \nSaturday PUNCH learnt that the day they arrived IMSU, they stayed at the hostel room of one of Chisom’s friends called Lilian. Later that night, they decided to go clubbing but Lilian reportedly told them she was not in the mood but decided to go with them after some persuasion. \nIt was learnt that the 200-Level ABSU undergraduate went clubbing with her friends on Friday night, March 3, 2017 but did not come back with them. \nShe reportedly left with a man she met at the club. \n“They told her not to go but she refused”, a statement released by Lilian’s sister, Chidinma said. \nLilian and Chisom, were said to have gone to the police to file a missing person report but were detained afterwards. \nMeanwhile just few hours after she was declared missing, a headless body of a young lady said to also be an undergraduate of ABSU was circulated over the internet, fuelling rumours that it was the corpse of Sandra. \nFindings by Saturday PUNCH later confirmed that the police in Imo State were still investigating the case of the headless body. \nOur correspondent spoke with Sandra’s sister, Vivian, who also confirmed that she was back home and in good health. \nShe did not offer any explanation as to why her sister could not be contacted to the point where she was thought to have been kidnapped. \nAlso, Sandra has not replied messages our correspondent sent to her on her social media accounts. \nHer sister sand where she is ready to talk, she would get back to our correspondent. \nA police officer familiar with the investigation into the disappearance of the Sandra, confirmed that her friends were released when she showed up. \nSpokesperson for the Imo State Police Command, Mr. Andrew Enwerem, was unreachable when our correspondent contacted him for comments. \nCopyright PUNCH.
