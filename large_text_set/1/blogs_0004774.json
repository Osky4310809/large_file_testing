Internal flap Edit \n\"Of power, I could tell you much. One must seize the moment, and strike.\" —Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin \nHe’s the scion of an honorable and revered family . A dedicated soldier and distinguished legislator. Loyal proponent of the Republic and trusted ally of the Jedi Order . Groomed by the ruthless politician and Sith Lord who would be Emperor , Governor Wilhuff Tarkin rises through the Imperial ranks, enforcing his authority ever more mercilessly… and zealously pursuing his destiny as the architect of absolute dominion. \nRule through the fear of force rather than force itself, he advises his Emperor. Under Tarkin's guidance, an ultimate weapon of unparalleled destruction moves ever closer to becoming a terrifying reality. When the so-called Death Star is completed, Tarkin is confident that the galaxy's lingering pockets of Separatist rebellion will be brought to heel—by intimidation… or annihilation. \nUntil then, however, insurgency remains a genuine threat. Escalating guerrilla attacks by resistance forces and newfound evidence of a growing Separatist conspiracy are an immediate danger the Empire must meet with swift and brutal action. And to bring down a band of elusive freedom fighters, the Emperor turns to his most formidable agents: Darth Vader , the fearsome new Sith enforcer as remorseless as he is mysterious; and Tarkin—whose tactical cunning and cold-blooded efficiency will pave the way for the Empire's supremacy… and its enemies' extinction. [4] Plot summary Edit TARKIN Five standard years have passed since Darth Sidious proclaimed himself galactic Emperor. The brutal Clone Wars are a memory, and the Emperor's apprentice, Darth Vader, has succeeded in hunting down most of the Jedi who survived dreaded Order 66. On Coruscant a servile Senate applauds the Emperor's every decree, and the populations of the Core Worlds bask in a sense of renewed prosperity. In the Outer Rim, meanwhile, the myriad species of former Separatist worlds find themselves no better off than they were before the civil war. Stripped of weaponry and resources, they have been left to fend for themselves in an Empire that has largely turned its back on them. Where resentment has boiled over into acts of sedition, the Empire has been quick to mete out punishment. But as confident as he is in his own and Vader's dark side powers, the Emperor understands that only a supreme military, overseen by a commander with the will to be as merciless as he is, can secure an Empire that will endure for a thousand generations.... [5] \nMoff Wilhuff Tarkin is stationed at Sentinel Base, an Imperial facility in the Outer Rim when the base was attacked by a ship made from amalgam Separatist parts, carrying droid fighters. After repelling the attack, he became suspicious of an ex-Separatist vendetta against the Empire , and was called to Coruscant to investigate. \nThe Emperor tasks Tarkin and Darth Vader to get to the bottom of the incident as the Imperial Security Bureau and Naval Intelligence squabbled. After a botched mission on Murkhana , Carrion Spike , Tarkin's personal modified stealth corvette, was stolen by unknown dissidents, who Tarkin was sure to be connected to the Sentinel Base attack, as well as being supported by someone high up in the Imperial military. Throughout the investigation, Tarkin has flashbacks to various moments of his past, centering on his childhood trials in an Eriadu wilderness region known as the Carrion, as well as his rise to prominence in the Republic Judicial Forces and the Outland Regions Security Force . \nAfter being evaded repeatedly, Tarkin and Vader managed to discover the dissidents to be led by an ex- Republic Intelligence agent Berch Teller , and anti-Imperial journalists Anora Fair and Hask Taff , supported by their co-conspirator, Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit , who wanted to use the incident to gain favor with the Emperor by betraying the rebels, thus securing a long desired position of Moff. While Vader executed Rancit, Tarkin led the Star Destroyer Executrix in destroying the dissident fleet, capturing most of the members who are executed. \nAfter the incident, Tarkin and Vader develop a new sense of mutual respect. The Emperor promotes Tarkin to Grand Moff, and assigns him management of the Death Star . As compensation for the lost Carrion Spike , the Executrix was granted to the Grand Moff as his personal vessel. Following the recent events, Tarkin gives an interview with a media publication that becomes the basis for the Tarkin Doctrine , the new Imperial military doctrine. Luring Teller into a trap, Tarkin captured the former agent at the Carrion on his homeworld Eriadu, but chose to spare him for sport. He then travels to Geonosis to oversee the construction of the Death Star. Development Edit \nThe novel and its title were announced on April 25 , 2014 .
