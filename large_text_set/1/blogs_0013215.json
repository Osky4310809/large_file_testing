He said at the time he felt “blessed and honored” working with Sessions on it. \nBooker acknowledged this in his remarks today, but he maintained that he believes his colleague has shown “hostility” towards certain aspects of criminal justice that he believes are important for the U.S. attorney general to hold. \nHe said Sessions would not be a leader in tackling racial bias in police departments across the country at a time when America needs more “hope and healing.” \nOne of the biggest reactions to Booker’s speech circulating on Twitter was that he was using it to raise his national profile for a presidential run: Cory Booker kicks off 2020 moves with testimony against Sessions: https://t.co/DkOoXeak8n pic.twitter.com/4tz391SjCy \n— The Hill (@thehill) January 11, 2017 Corrie Booker finishes Sessions testimony by handing out Booker2020 bumper stickers \n— Jazz Shaw (@JazzShaw) January 11, 2017 It was courteous of Cory Booker to begin and end his 2020 presidential campaign on the same day. \n— Ian Tuttle (@iptuttle) January 11, 2017 The \"make America just again\" theme Booker laid out in his testimony against Sessions will be a good animating theme for his 2020 campaign. \n— Ian Millhiser (@imillhiser) January 11, 2017 Cory Booker begins his Booker for President 2020 campaign today. #SessionsHearing", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:28:57.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
