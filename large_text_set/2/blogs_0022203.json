Share via Twitter Instagram via @tammyhembrow Australian fitness blogger Tammy Hembrow's Instagram page is covered with beautiful selfies that document her fitness journey. And most people don't even realize that Hembrow gave birth to her second child six months ago. But the fitness enthusiast is proving that the physical changes are inevitable after childbirth, even if you work out daily. In a recent Instagram post, Hembrow kept it real and showed her followers how pregnancy has really changed her body. And the fitness blogger isn't ashamed at all. \"Proud of my mama bod and my loose skin,\" Hembrow wrote in the caption. In the selfie, you can see her baby girl's foot pressing up against her stomach's stretched skin. And this loose skin is very common postpartum. The faster women lose weight after pregnancies, the higher their chances of getting loose skin . That's because the body hasn't had that much time to recover and replenish elastin. (Those are the proteins that make the skin bouncy.) Hembrow's image is showing many women not to sweat those changes that come with motherhood. And it's also making several moms feel proud of their ever-changing bodies . Related: 9 Ways Pregnancy Can Permanently Change Your Body \"I love [you] for this.
