Long Story \nAre you one of the guys who is married, but takes off your wedding ring when you go out to meet the ladies. No judgment here — I'll leave that to the Today Show's Katie Couric. \n\"Nothing is creepier than a guy who takes off his wedding ring,\" said Couric on Thursday's program . \nThe morning chatterboxes had a quick chat about a new black diamond-encrusted black gold ring developed by Jason of Beverly Hills. I can't tell you how much it costs, because I 100% don't have enough moolah to \"request a quote,\" but I'm positive I can't afford one. \nNor, would I want one. The special feature of the ring is that it is embossed with 'deirram' on the inside. So when the wearer takes it off, they've got \"married\" printed right there for all their potential mistresses to see. jasonofbh.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:20:05.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
