We snapped the lovebirds at Diljit Dosanjh’s next film Phillauri’s movie screening tonight where they were seen arriving in the same car. Well, that’s a first.. no? I mean they have been spotted together innumerous times but do you remember seeing them together in the same car? The couple didn’t seem to be too pleased to be clicked by the paparazzi but nevertheless, they didn’t shy away from the shutterbugs either.. \nSonakshi and Bunty have been going strong since over a year now and initially there were reports that the duo might get married this year. Although no confirmations have been made on that so far, the Akira girl keeps making these appearances with her boyfriend time and again which speak volumes about their relationship. So don’t you guys think that Sona and Bunty should now make an official announcement about it? (ALSO READ: Sonakshi Sinha and Bunty Sachdej are going strong, these pictures prove it ) \n\nThere were also rumours of her getting engaged to Bunty this year but we are not too sure if that’s gonna happen this year. Earlier, we had reported how the actress was rejecting films because she was planning to get engaged. In fact, Filmfare also suggested that Sonakshi’s mother Poonam Sinha disapproved of this relationship. On the work front, Sonakshi is gearing up for her next film Noor in which she plays a journalist . She will be seen in Ittefaq after that which also stars Sidharth Malhotra in the lead role. \nAmong others who were seen arriving for the movie screening were Rajkumar Hirani, Rhea Chakraborty, Sidharth Malhotra and a few others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:13:40.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
