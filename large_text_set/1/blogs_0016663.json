Luckily, Twitter was up for the job.\nThe first and most obvious criticism was that Garza himself became a father at the tender age of 18. How's that for hypocrisy? \n. @Gdeuceswild Yeahhh. How many ppl do you know who are abstinent? Don't lecture women about abstinence...especially when you had a kid at 18\n‚Äî Nick Bolton (@NickBolton13) January 13, 2017 \nMatt Garza has 6 kids and became a father when he was a teenager.
