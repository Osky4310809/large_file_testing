Consequently the second and third largest companies in this sector, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, are to merge next year creating a new behemoth. Even as these shifts are underway, the consumer experience has been mixed. If India is one of the cheapest markets in the world for mobile phone calls, the quality of telecom services is often disappointing. If regulatory standards can be enhanced even as market forces push the industry to adapt to new developments, the consumer will be the biggest beneficiary.\nAs with mergers in other industries, the two companies expect to save on expenses on account of synergies. Smartphones are now the most important channel connecting Indians to the internet. The consequent shift in emphasis from voice to data and the arrival of new competitors with deep pockets have nudged telecom companies to look at alternate strategies for survival. India appears set to resemble other markets where a handful of companies dominate the telecom market.\nOver the last decade entry barriers in telecom have risen considerably, primarily in the form of capital requirement. High entry barriers typically reduce competitive pressures over time and favour incumbents. In a technology industry such as telecom, it is very likely fundamental transformations can completely change the pecking order in a decade. But the regulator can also play a role in enhancing competition, among other things by getting its pricing right on spectrum. As a scarce natural resource it is only right that spectrum be auctioned. However, steep floor prices set at spectrum auctions have been driven less by logic and more by the ghosts of earlier corruption controversies.\nTelecom is set to be one of the most drivers of growth in India over the next decade. Not only does it hold enormous potential to enhance economic productivity, it can bring about more accountability in governance. A key element in making this happen will be a policy framework and regulatory architecture that is agnostic between different technologies and keeps anti-competitive activities under check. We have come a long way from a state monopoly rationing telephone landlines. But the history of technology industry shows that that progress and attendant consumer benefits keep coming only when nimble new players are given opportunities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:59:54.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
