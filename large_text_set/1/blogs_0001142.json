Prepare to get burned like fresh, never frozen, North American beef on a grill.\nTwitter user Parker Molloy captured one such skewering when she uploaded screenshots of a conversation between the official Wendy's Twitter account and that of illustrator and Wendy's critic, Thuggy-D, who tweets from a private account.\nSEE ALSO: A Hampton Inn in Utah started a Twitter war with J. Cole\nThings got heated as hot plate, when the customer dared question the conditions under which Wendy's beef is stored. Seems like Wendy's does not take kindly to insolence.\n\"Our beef is way too cool to ever be frozen,\" the chain restaurant tweeted.\n\"Your beef is frozen and we all know it.

Like you're really a joke,\" said Thuggy-D.\nAnd with that, began a sassy exchange to rival that time two Thomas the Tank Engine accounts went at each other.\n2017 is off to quite a start. pic.twitter.com/V9XWY7J4gp\nâ€” Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) January 3, 2017\nIndeed, the bar has been set for 2017.
