Bush says ISIS can be degraded and defeated. Watch the interview all this week at 10pm ET on #Hannity . pic.twitter.com/dcvT8dv6cf \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) February 27, 2017 \n“You’ve heard both presidents after my time say they’re going to degrade and defeat ISIS,” Bush said. “And I say, ‘Go get ’em,’ because they can be degraded and defeated.”   \n“It’s very important in my mind that we do so,” Bush continued. “So that people know they can rely upon us and the people — not only governments, but people on the ground, people who want to be free.” \nAccording to The Hill , Bush then proceeded to talk about the veterans who serve as the subject of his new book, “Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief’s Tribute to America’s Warriors,” and some of the inspiring things they have told him about their time in the war zones. \n“And you ask some of these troops, ‘Were you able to see human deprivation and improvement?’ And they say, ‘Yes’,” Bush said. “A lot of them say to me, ‘I love the idea of girls being able to go to school for the first time in Afghanistan’ or, ‘young kids in Iraq being no longer subjected to the thuggery of these ideological, you know, thugs.’” \nThe liberal media would like nothing better than to find an issue to use as a wedge between Trump and his most recent Republican predecessor, and while they may find some hints of criticism on issues like immigration, there is apparently no daylight to be found between them when it comes to crushing the country’s enemies in the Islamic State group.
