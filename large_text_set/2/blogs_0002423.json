Underpinned by a noxious flood of subbass, the track elaborates an ambiance of heated dread by melding gestures from the producer's drum and bass background with a techno template. Centrifugal synth contortions fill out the rest of the sonic space, which heaves like some ghostly mass in an unsteady, yet oddly exhilarating rhythm. \nThe producer told THUMP about his approach to the track, and to Pagans in general via email. \"'Astrous' was a good opportunity for me to show what else I can do,\" he said. \"In previous releases, I've gone in on what I like to call 'my style' along with venturing out to other tempos, but on Pagans I feel I've showed another skill set and put together an EP with a proper varied selection.\" \nThe Pagans EP will be out on digital and vinyl formats February 3, and is available for pre-order . \nFollow Alexander on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:02:01.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
