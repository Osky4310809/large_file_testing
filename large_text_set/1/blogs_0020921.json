Nobody was hurt. \nThe one-alarm blaze was discovered about 3:45 p.m. in the restaurant at 5201 Shaw Avenue, in The Hill neighborhood. \nThe business, a landmark for four decades, was in the news earlier this month after a $14,000 mink coat was misplaced , and in December when its founder, Giovanni Gabriele, was charged with molesting a woman there. \nAccording to the restaurant website, it opened in 1973 with clientele who have included Frank Sinatra, Oprah Winfrey and Paul McCartney. Giovanni’s is one of only six restaurants in the St. Louis area to have a four-diamond rating from the AAA’s national restaurant guide. \nAs firefighters wrapped up their work Wednesday, the founder’s son, Carmelo Gabriele, told a reporter the restaurant “absolutely” will reopen. \nHe said the business has been upgrading its wiring for weeks and that a fire was discovered after an electrical worker smelled smoke. He said the flames appeared to have started in a junction box in the wall of the second-floor banquet room. \nFire Chief Dennis Jenkerson confirmed that electricians were working there but said the official cause of the fire has not yet been determined. \n“There was fire venting through the roof. There is heavy damage to the second floor. This building was extensively damaged,” Jenkerson said. \nThe business was not due to open Wednesday until 5 p.m., so there were no customers present when the flames broke out. The two electricians and six restaurant workers inside escaped safely. \nThe misplaced coat incident was resolved when the restaurant tracked the missing garment to someone else after a coat check worker mixed up two minks. \nThe month before, Giovanni Gabriele, 75, of Chesterfield, was charged with first-degree sodomy, second-degree sexual abuse and third-degree assault, in the name Gabriele Giovanni, and released after posting $30,000 bail. His lawyer has insisted he is innocent. \nA woman who worked for a security company alleged that he licked and kissed her without permission, restrained her to a chair, reached up her dress and told her he wanted her to perform sodomy. \nGiovanni’s is one of only six restaurants in the St. Louis area to have a four-diamond rating from the AAA’s national restaurant guide.
