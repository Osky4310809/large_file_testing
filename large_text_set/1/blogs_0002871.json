While some of us may celebrate with shots and chanting \"Ding dong, the witch is dead,\" some may find it appropriate to look back on a truly spectacular year in films, especially those coming from the indie sector. Inevitably, video essayists and casual videomakers, like Max Shishkin , Fernando Andrés , and Ben Zuk , have created end-of-year supercuts and mashups of all of 2016's films , so, we chose a few of our favorites as a fitting tribute to a year that we hate to see go, but love to watch leave. \nIt's heartening to see filmmakers in 2016 continuing to push boundaries and take chances with their projects. Barry Jenkins told a story most feared to tell in Moonlight , the Daniels managed to sell a film about a farting corpse, and Nicolas Winding Refn and DP Natasha Braier showed us some of the most spectacular cinematography in Neon Demon . Hopefully 2017 will show us the same spirit. \nWhat were your favorite films of 2016?
