Sadie was born with Schinzelâ€“Giedion syndrome, a rare, terminal, neurodegenerative disorder that causes severe seizures, developmental delays, and various organ defects. At one point, Sadie was having over 300 seizures a day. As a last-ditch desperate effort after exhausting all traditional treatment options, her parents turned to Real Scientific Hemp Oil , a high-CBD and low-THC oil that is inserted into her feeding tube. According to Sadie's father, the effect was immediate and her seizures subsided within minutes. Sadie has started preschool and is nearly seizure-free. She's hitting milestones that doctors never thought possible. \nNow, her family wants to meet President-elect Donald Trump through the Make-A-Wish program to help advocate for medical marijuana. Her father says that he thinks his daughter would want to \"give back\" and to help other patients like her who could benefit from medicinal cannabis. \nIn December, the DEA classified CBD oil as a Schedule 1 narcotic. This means that the DEA does not believe that CBD oil has any medicinal properties and has a high potential for abuse. (This, of course, despite the complete lack of psychoactive properties of the drug.) \nDonald Trump has been in favor of legalizing medical marijuana in the past. It's unclear as of now as to whether Sadie will get her wish to meet with Trump, but having the ability to put real faces on issues is only a good thing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T05:39:54.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
