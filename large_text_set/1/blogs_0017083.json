It also takes off from the Duterte administration’s 10 point socioeconomic agenda. \nSocioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia, who chairs the Plan Steering Committee, said NEDA intends to complete the new PDP by Jan. 31 and present it to the NEDA Board for final approval within the second week of February. \nMembers of the committee include secretaries Rafael Mariano of agrarian reform, Judy Taguiwalo of social welfare and development, Arthur Tugade of transportation, Mark Villar of public works and highways, Gina Lopez of environment and natural resources, Fortunato dela Peña of science and technology, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella, Cabinet Secretary Leoncio Evasco Jr. and national security adviser Hermogenes Esperon. \n“This PDP fleshes out the President’s priority socioeconomic agenda. Importantly, it is about laying the foundations for AmBisyon Natin 2040, which articulates the Filipino people’s shared aspirations for the country. As such, it is about nation-building. And we appreciate the perseverance and patience of all agencies involved in the crafting of our nation’s development plan for the next six years,” said Pernia.
