The bid is worth 47.07 euros based on Friday’s share price, 5 percent lower than Luxottica’s close of 49.56 euros. \nLeonardo Del Vecchio , Luxottica’s 81-year-old founder and controlling shareholder, agreed to the deal and will become executive chairman and chief executive officer of the new company, EssilorLuxottica, which will have more than 15 billion euros in annual revenue. Del Vecchio will be the single largest shareholder with his Delfin holding company owning a stake of between 31 and 38 percent. \nThe deal creates a branded goods giant with a market value that rivals the second-biggest luxury maker Hermes International . The companies said they expect revenue and cost synergies of 400 million euros to 600 million euros in the medium term. Essilor is the largest manufacturer in the industry and Luxottica the biggest retailer, according to Chris Cooper, an analyst at Jefferies. \nEssilor Chairman and CEO Hubert Sagnieres will become executive vice chairman and deputy CEO with equal powers. \nDel Vecchio’s Delfin agreed to contribute its 62 percent stake in Luxottica to Essilor in exchange for stock in the newly created group that will be listed in Paris. Essilor will then make a mandatory offer for the remaining Luxottica stock at the same exchange ratio. \nMilan-based Luxottica, which also makes frames for luxury brands such as Armani, Chanel, and Prada, has a market value of about 24 billion euros as of Jan. 13, compared with about 22 billion euros for lens maker Essilor. Luxottica, which owns the Sunglass Hut retail chain, also is developing voice-activated glasses that coach cyclists and runners. Luxury Goods Competitor \n“This is a merger where they will be able to complement each other and create economies of scale on the supply chain,” said Catherine Lim, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “Luxottica is a licensee of major branded eyewear while Essilor has been more focused on making lenses.” \nLuxottica increasingly competes with large luxury players such as Kering in a global eyewear industry worth about $121 billion last year, according to data from Euromonitor. The company’s expansion into lenses is attractive amid rising consumer demand and as the segment offers high margins, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \nDemand for eyewear is expanding in emerging markets with more than 2.3 billion people in Asia, Africa and Latin America needing optical frames, according to Exane BNP Paribas. \nThe two companies have been on a “collision course,” Exane said in a note in October as Luxottica moves into lens manufacturing while Essilor advances into frames and acquires control of online eyewear retailers. Lens manufacturing will be a big deal for Luxottica as it makes it independent for sun and prescription lenses, it said. \nLuxottica announced last March it will seek to accelerate growth by investing more than 1.5 billion euros over three years. \nMediobanca SpA advised Delfin, while Citigroup Global Markets and Rothschild & Co worked for Essilor.
