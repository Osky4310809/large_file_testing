She is not an acolyte. \nIndeed several such figures did not even make council leader Sir Richard Leese’s shortlist. \nNeither does she already head up another major league town hall such as Westminster, Leeds or Liverpool. \nAnd nor is she a man. \nConsequently many assumed she was being brought in purely to oversee what is often considered the softer side of running a council: children’s services, social care, neighbourhood issues, rather than the headline-grabbing hard-edged regeneration and investment wins that gained Sir Howard national plaudits. \nLeave the building to the big boys. Manchester Town Hall \nAs she works out her last few days as chief executive across the Pennines in Wakefield, Roney is fully aware of that view. But there is a glint in her eye. \nManchester has indeed signalled that it wants more priority given to issues such as homelessness, roads and child protection, she agrees. \n“Manchester city council’s credibility – and I said this in the interview – comes from its core services being good and we know what they are,” she says. \n“My background is in homelessness and I’m excited to see what we can do about that. Read More What's life really like in Greater Manchester? The results of the biggest ever Manchester Evening News survey revealed \n“And obviously your basic services, your neighbourhood services. Transport clearly is a big issue – huge investment going into transport, massive disruption as a consequence. How do you square that off with genuine dialogue with the public that says ‘this is the pay-off’?” \nShe says it will also be a priority to get children’s services ‘right’ ahead of their next full Ofsted inspection after being found inadequate in 2014. \nBut that doesn’t mean she’s about to be pigeon-holed. \n“When people take that as meaning I’m not interested in the other stuff, that I won’t be doing it, I actually think there’s a gender perspective to that, a stereotyping, and that’s not true,” she says. \n“If something has fired me up – very much so – it’s this view that somehow I’m not going to be dealing with developers or the economic growth agenda. \n“It’s very interesting that, isn’t it?” \nRoney points to a CV that in some ways has echoes of Sir Howard’s own. \nHaving joined Birmingham council at 16 as an apprentice, she has now worked her way up to arguably the top local government job in the country. \nA Birmingham City fan, in her home city she gained professional qualifications in housing and went on to be director of housing at Kirklees council, as well as working with the charity Shelter and serving as deputy chief executive in Sheffield.

Manchester has always been, throughout my career, the place you went to,” she says, describing Sir Howard as ‘a legend’. \n“It was a hotbed of forward thinking – innovative, good ideas. You always had a connection with Manchester.” \nAnd just as Sir Howard brokered deals with government, turning it into an art-form in the last two decades, she too has the numbers of permanent secretaries in Whitehall to whom she will keep talking, she adds. \nSir Howard’s shoes will perhaps not so much be filled, but re-tailored. \n“I’ve been in this game longer than people might realise,” she smiles. “I’m not a complete novice and my little black book has just as many interesting numbers in it as others, I daresay.” \nNevertheless there are clear differences between her tone and Sir Howard’s at a time when the power play in Greater Manchester is shifting up a gear, ahead of a new mayor and rising public concern over a range of social issues, notably many related to housing.

She does not shy away from the challenges, some of them self-imposed, of being a woman in a such a male-dominated sphere. \n“When the opportunity came up to be chief executive, I had a long chat with myself. ‘Here you are Joanne, you’ve been in this about 400 years, here’s an opportunity to be a senior woman in the most exciting city at a time when local government is entering a completely new phase.’ \n“Why wouldn’t I want to end my career by being at the top of the league, I guess? \n“It’s taken me a while to be comfortable with the honest answer – which is I’m probably more ambitious than I ever acknowledged in myself.” \nIt sounds like a very female way of approaching an important job application. Rather than automatically assume you can cut it, instead go through a wretched internal argument about whether you absolutely, definitely can cut it. \nShe instantly agrees. \n“There is truth to that and I carry that responsibility very much as well.

The answer to what scheme should progress where in what circumstances is often through ‘let’s look again at the designs, let’s see if we can’t compromise somewhere’. \n“But you can’t leave a city like Manchester and just say ‘that’s it’ on the development front, we’re not going do anything else. \n“So there’s got to be some challenge to some sites that need replacing. Keep bits, change bits, which bits do we keep. Let’s talk about it.” \nRoney’s appointment comes at a moment of huge change for both the city and Greater Manchester. \nShe admits the success of health devolution - ‘why don’t we say it as it is, this is really ambitious and really difficult and really complicated and utterly right, so all of those things will have me worried’ – will be the biggest, most exciting and most pressing challenge for her, the one that will keep up her up at night. \nBut there is also the stability of the overall Greater Manchester project too, with new officials in charge, a new mayor and no Sir Howard, 20 years after the city began its resurgence. \nAdmitting the moment is ‘significant’, she insists this is simply the ‘next phase’, before reaching for a tactful football analogy. \n“Of course you have got new players for the next season. \n“It doesn’t mean it’s still not a successful team, does it? Or that the game’s changed or the ambitions have changed, or that anything in terms of the momentum will be lost. \n“It’s just – new players on the pitch.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T10:22:09.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
