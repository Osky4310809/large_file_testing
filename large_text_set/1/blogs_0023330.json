As recently as 2014-2015, Squaw Alpine reported a total of 223 inches for the season , a total they’re already coming close to hitting three weeks into January. \nPut into a national context, California has seen so much snow this January that — according to OnTheSnow — of the 15 resorts with the highest snow totals in the United States, 11 of them are in California. Mammoth Mountain, which has the largest snow total in the country, has received fresh snow 15 of the 23 days of this month . \nAnd all of that snow has excited powderhounds posting photos on Instagram to document the madness: A photo posted by Chris Benchetler (@chrisbenchetler) on Jan 23, 2017 at 7:52am PST A photo posted by Homewood Mountain Resort (@skihomewood) on Jan 23, 2017 at 10:09am PST A photo posted by @jakemarin_ on Jan 23, 2017 at 10:03am PST A photo posted by Mammoth Mountain (@mammothmountain) on Jan 21, 2017 at 6:09am PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:15:59.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
