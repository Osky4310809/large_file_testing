View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nDesign thinking is not just the way of the future, but is essential to business success, according to Tim Brown, CEO and president of international design consulting firm IDEO, who are considered pioneers in this progressive and creative methodology. \nRegardless of the industry, tomorrow’s organisations will need to apply tools from the world of design and think like designers, but with a strong skew on human behaviour, if they are to keep ahead. Design thinking is essential for every industry, from education to healthcare” David Zach, Futurist \n“The most valuable company in the world places design at the centre of everything it does,” Brown wrote in an article published in the Harvard Business Review last year. “Now that design thinking is everywhere, it’s tempting to simply declare it dead – to ordain something new in its place. \n“It’s a methodology always in pursuit of unforeseen innovation, so reinventing itself might seem like the smart way forward. But in practice, design thinking is a set of tools that can grow old with us. And I’d argue that in order to create sustained competitive advantage, businesses must be not just practitioners, but masters of the art.” \nJonah Cretser-Hartenstein, manager of Digital Innovation and Emerging Channels at ING DIRECT, agrees, describing design thinking as “a global phenomenon” and that the key to future success lies in harnessing this creative methodology to set a brand, company or product apart.

Mobile phones are a great example. Blackberry recently announced that they will no longer be producing mobile handsets. It was not that long ago that they were the leader in this space. But they were not able to differentiate themselves well enough as new players came into the market. And I think a big part of that is not really being in tune with the evolution of the customer desire. Human centred design is not just important to an organisation’s future success, it’s absolutely essential.” \nFuturist David Zach describes design as being “the centre point not just of the economy, but where art and science meet form and function, strength and beauty – and it’s essential for every industry, from education to healthcare”. Jonah Crester-Hartenstein, ING Direct Photograph: Supplied by ING Direct \nIn an online interview with SEGC (Society for Environmental Graphic Design), Zach was asked what conclusions might be drawn about the future of design. His response: “From where I’m sitting, two major forces are driving the economy: design and logistics. Design is how you create and organise your thinking about things; logistics is about how you organise and distribute those things. Logistics is measurable, design not as much. We are also seeing the automation of so many tasks.” \nThe potential of design thinking knows no boundaries. Its innovative and creative approach has been incorporated into a wide range of industries from healthcare, humanitarian and education to government, banking and retail. And while it is impossible to predict exactly how design will look in the future, there’s no doubt the focus will continue to shine firmly on the customer experience. \n“The exciting thing about design is that it is always evolving,” Cretser-Hartenstein says. “At ING DIRECT we’ve always been a very customer-centric company, but what customer centric meant and the way that we developed products and services even five years ago is different to the way we think about it now. And it will be different again in the next five years. \n“It’s hard to say what will happen in 10 years because so much of it will be led by the expectations of the customer. But if we look at a few of the trends, we are seeing a much faster uptake of technology, so the ability to respond to that is going to be crucial. We’re also seeing a proliferation of choice in the marketplace, which means consumers can be more discerning about what products or services they take up. \n“But I think the biggest change will be around speed and our ability to understand the needs of our customers better than our competitors do. And as a result, I think we will see a lot more co-creation with customers. We will need to have the ability to understand quicker and deeper, and respond and iterate products and services to keep pace with changing consumer demand. What is human centred design?

The methodology we are using at ING we have branded internally as ‘PACE’ because we want to be able to increase the pace of innovation. It is customer centric with a combination of design thinking, lean start-up and agile methodologies so we can iterate and deliver quickly to meet our customers’ needs.” \nThe companies that will succeed in the future will be those that put design thinking at the top of the agenda, enabling them to truly understand their customer needs and expectations. In turn, they will not only be equipped to meet those needs and expectations, but also to exceed them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:04:51.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
