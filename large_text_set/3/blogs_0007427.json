Audio: Restoring the legacy of Albert Namatjira (Awaye!) \n\"Or it could have been that I was on holidays and somebody else in the office signed it without realising it should have only been for seven years. \n\"That bothers me, that I or someone in the office may have signed something which wasn't a reflection of what we were doing. Unless I see the file and saw something different on the file ... it was never my intention.\" \nAn actuary valued the seven years of copyright at $8,500 in 1983. Mr Flynn did not consult an art expert regarding the valuation. \n\"In hindsight, a cautious public trustee would have done that,\" he said.

(ABC) \nColin Golvan, a barrister specialising in intellectual property law and a trustee of the Namatjira Legacy Trust, is highly critical of the sale and says Namatjira's estate was significantly undervalued. \n\"The public trustee should never have, in my view, parted with the copyright in the way that was done,\" he told Awaye!. \n\"It's indicative of the kind of state of incredible disadvantage that the copyright in Albert Namatjira could have been sold for such a small amount of money. \n\"You can imagine that return over the years would have very, very significantly exceeded the capital value which was recognised by the Public Trustee. \n\"It's another tragedy to add to the litany of tragedies that surround Albert's life.\" Rights could be returned to family and extended \nAccording to Mr Golvan, if Namatjira's copyright were returned to his family, there's an argument that it could be extended in perpetuity, as in the case of the published work Peter Pan, by the Scottish author JM Barrie. \nIn that case, the proceeds from the licensing of Barrie's copyright over Peter Pan flow not to his heirs, but to a children's hospital in London. \n\"We can and must reconcile ourselves to a situation which by and large needs redress,\" Mr Golvan said. \n\"And if we can't get redress in the case of the great Albert Namatjira, then where to do we start?\" Photo: Lenie Namatjira, the artist's grand-daughter, teaching outside Hermannsburg. (Image courtesy of Big HArt Inc.) \nMany of Namatjira's descendants live in poverty, with the sale of their artwork — in their grandfather's distinctive Hermannsburg style — their only source of income. \nNamatjira's granddaughter Gloria Pannka firmly believes that he would have wanted his descendants to benefit from his copyright estate. \n\"It's the future we are looking at,\" she said. \n\"If we do get the copyright back, it would help us a lot.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:29:15.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
