It’s been four years since the Oscar winner last came to the big screen with the underrated “The Bling Ring,” but something tells us there’s no way her new drama is going to go unnoticed. Marking Coppola’s reunions with Kirsten Dunst (“The Virgin Suicides”) and Elle Fanning (“Somewhere”), “ The Beguiled ” finds the writer-director making her first period drama, and Entertainment Weekly has gorgeous first look images from the film. \nREAD MORE: ‘The Beguiled’: Kirsten Dunst Shares Photo With Elle Fanning From Last Day on Sofia Coppola’s Set \n“The Beguiled” is based on the 1966 Thomas Cullinan novel, which was previously adapted into a 1971 film starring Clint Eastwood. Coppola’s version will be told from the perspective of the female characters. Nicole Kidman stars as the headmistress of a secluded school for girls in 1864 Virginia. Their lifestyle is disrupted by the discovery of a wounded Union Army solider (Colin Farrell), whose arrival seduces both the students and the teachers and causes jealousy and betrayal. \n“The main crux of the story is about the dynamics between a group of women all stuck together, and then also the power shifts between men and women,” Coppola tells Entertainment Weekly . “So for me, it’s very universal, but it’s in this exotic setting of the Southern gentility.” \nFocus Features has already set “The Beguiled” for release on June 23, making a Cannes world premiere very likely.
