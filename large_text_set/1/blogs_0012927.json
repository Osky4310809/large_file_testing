Wearing the ghoul mask in Fallout 3 makes all feral ghouls ignore the player unless directly assaulted. Despite what Roy Phillips says, no matter how close you get to a feral ghoul when wearing the ghoul mask, they will not \"Sniff you out,\" and become hostile. Feral ghoul roamer Main article: Feral ghoul roamer \nRoamers are less common feral ghouls dressed in worn-out sections of old combat armor, giving them greater damage resistance. The armor does not, however, slow them down; in fact, they are slightly faster than regular ferals. They typically can be found alongside two or three ferals, and attack in groups. Alone they are still weak and easily brought down with most weaponry, but they can easily flank the player during a group attack. Feral ghoul reaver Main article: Feral ghoul reaver \nThis rare flavor of ghoul, dressed in the rusty remnants of metal armor , appears throughout the post-apocalyptic Mojave Wasteland , the Commonwealth , and the Capital Wasteland through the Fallout 3 add-on Broken Steel . They also appear frequently in the swamps of Point Lookout. A greenish smoke issues from their scars, and their flesh appears to be melted and even bubbling in some areas, as if being \"cooked\" by the radiation they have absorbed. In Fallout 3 they are among the toughest enemies in the game, able to take a direct hit from a Fat Man and survive. Besides being incredibly fast and having a deadly swipe, they can pull chunks of radioactive gore from their guts and hurl it at the player with deadly accuracy. In Fallout: New Vegas , reavers are much weaker and lack the ability to throw gore, making them much easier to handle. Glowing one Main article: Glowing one \nThese ghouls have absorbed so much radiation they glow a ghastly green color in the dark. They are known as \"glowing ones,\" and are often considered outsiders even by other ghouls. The glowing ones can sustain a lot more damage than other ghouls, second only to reavers (see above). They also emit radiation from their whole body, and can even release a devastating blast of energy from their bodies at will, healing nearby ghouls and harming unlucky attackers caught in the blast radius. \nPeople have seen on more than one occasion a feral glowing one fighting or being chased by \"normal\" feral ghouls. Although very rare, it is possible for a glowing one to retain their intelligence and cognitive functions, such as Jason Bright and Oswald. Intelligent ghoul Edit An intelligent ghoul, Charon \nIntelligent ghouls have suffered far less mental degradation from their condition and retain their full faculties from before their transformation. These ghouls possess the ability to talk, and they normally wear clothing, as well as carrying and using weapons. Some may have hair on their head, but not a lot. Some male ghouls, such as Raul Tejada , may even be lucky enough to retain some semblance of facial hair, similar to Desmond in the Fallout 3 add-on Point Lookout , with hair on both his head and face. They normally have a low, gravely and rather raspy voice, most likely due to damage to their vocal chords from a combination of radiation and necrosis. Jason Bright , an intelligent glowing one, from Fallout: New Vegas has a normal voice, although it has an odd echoing quality to it. If Megaton is destroyed in Fallout 3 , Moira Brown has a similar, but notably different voice effect. Regular ghouls walk normally, unlike ferals, which hunch over. The majority of them are not hostile and will not attack without provocation. Ghouls often refer to humans as \"smoothskins.\" These ghouls also find terms such as \"shuffler\" and \"zombie\" to be offensive. Hostile intelligent ghouls, violent even without provocation, do exist, however; most noteworthy are the Chinese remnant , Chinese spies, soldiers, and special forces units trapped in the United States following the Great War . Remnant forces are wholly unaware (or perhaps in denial) of the worldwide nuclear destruction that has occurred and believe that they are still in a state of war, continuing to follow old objectives sent to them pre-war by the People's Liberation Army . Remnant forces have retained much of their intelligence and training, and attack all those they encounter without hesitation. Remnants only appear in Fallout 3 . Marked men Main article: Marked men \nSkinned alive by the winds of the Divide (via a failed Big MT experiment), and turned into ghouls by the radiation of the exploded underground missiles, marked men suffer from a unique form of ghoulification only seen in the Divide . The injuries they suffer from would mean the death of an ordinary ghoul, and the radiation of the Divide is believed to be the only thing keeping them alive. Despite still being cognitive enough to carry weapons and utilize advanced tactics such as constructing outposts and utilizing guard towers, they are still immediately hostile to any and all outsiders that ventures into the Divide. Born ghoul Main article: Born ghoul The following is based on Van Buren andhas not been confirmed by canon sources. \nThrough cruel experimentation on humans by Dr. Sebastian at the Reservation , born ghouls were created. They are ghouls who were not mutated humans, but who were actually born into ghoul-dom. There are only three known born ghouls. End of information based on Van Buren . Notes Edit Although not currently explained, ghouls may be able to survive without food, water or air. Billy Peabody survived locked in a fridge for 210 years with presumably only what was left in the fridge, And Mr. Keller was still \"alive\" after being ghoulified and being stuck in a bunker for 200 years with only irradiated food and possibly the flesh of his relatives . This suggests an ability to survive on radiation alone. Ghoulification also seems to halt any aging process in affected humans, as Billy Peabody is a pre-War ghoul who became a ghoul as a child and has seen no further mental or physical development for 210 years without becoming feral. This may not be canon however as another ghoul, Carol , was a little girl when she was changed and is fully grown in Fallout 3. Another possibility is that the radiation can have different effects on ghouls. The eye color of a person that underwent ghoulification changes: Most ghouls have blue irises (that become fully white when they get feral) and some ghouls keep their natural eye color (such as Billy). Ghouls can have \"unnatural\" colors such as red ( Set and to an extent Zao , because he has red scleras and blue irises) and a ghoul's eye color can sometimes completely change (like the representative and John Hancock who have black eyes after they became ghouls.) Despite a claim to the contrary, feral ghouls are indeed hostile to intelligent ghouls. Although this is likely to be a gameplay mechanic and not canon. In an unmarked location in Fallout 4, inside a locked shack, a feral ghoul can be seen feeding off the dead body of either a human or another ghoul suggesting that if hungry enough they will eat flesh. The west coast seems to have accepted ghouls more than other communities (with the exception of the West Coast Brotherhood of Steel who still practice hereditary inclusion) as the NCR and the Followers of the Apocalypse are shown utilizing ghouls as they would any other citizen, employee, or volunteer. Bigotry towards ghouls appears to minimal rate (with the exception of Diamond City and the Brotherhood of Steel), because ghouls are allowed to join settlements and no one refers to them as Zombies. However it appears ghouls are still not allowed to join the Minutemen or the Railroad. In the games Fallout 3 and 4, there appears to be a connection to the \"Dunwich\" building and the \"Dunwich borers\". In both locations Ghouls appear to be attracted to a deity called \"Ug-qualtoth\". Notable quotes Edit \"The future. Survival anywhere. We surpass the norms.\" – Set talks about ghouls \"There ain't any ghouls but old ghouls. We're all sterile, see, but we're incredibly long-lived. We're the first and last generation of ghouls.\" - Typhon \"Without medical technology, all of us ghouls are going to die off in the next 20 years, anyway.\" - Gordon \"With silver-bells and cockleshells and… Boy, you are dumb, aren’t you? Severe radiation. That’s how. How do you think? You know, many bombs go boom, flash of light and heat, flesh burns off, but you don’t-quite-die-type severe radiation?\" - Wooz \"Not bad, still in one piece... well except for that one that got away, but I'll find it, no worries.\" - Patchwork \" I don't have to tell you that Bright's group has got some fine-looking ghoulettes in it! Eh... or maybe I would have to tell you. \" Play sound NVHarlandFineLookingGhoulettes.ogg - Harland , Fallout: New Vegas \"Well, now that's a surprise! I'm used to every asshole smoothskin in this town giving me shit 'cause I look like a corpse.\" - Gob , Fallout 3 \"Hey! Who you callin' a zombie?\" - Roy Phillips , Fallout 3 \"Of the people for the people\" - Hancock , Fallout 4 Appearances \nGhouls appear in every Fallout game to date. Behind the scenes Edit A ghoul is described as \"Bloodman\" in an old Fallout concept art piece. In folklore, a ghoul is a monster or spirit that is associated with graveyards and consuming human flesh.
