Previously available in Leather, Link or Silicone bands, the wearable is now only available in Milanese Loop, and Sport bands when you’re getting a brand new model. \nThis has, in turn, increased the pricing of the leather, as well as link bands if you intend to purchase them separately. This comes freshly after the announcement of a few new watch bands as part of Apple’s Spring 2017 collection . \nCustomers will now be able to get Sport bands in Pebble (Blue), Azure, and Camelia colors. Woven Nylon bands in Berry, Tahoe Blue, Orange, Red, Pollen, and Midnight Blue. Finally, the leather or Classic Buckle bands in Berry, Sapphire, and Taupe. The Nike Sport bands are now sold separately. \nApple has also launched silicone and leather cases for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in the same colors, essentially offering a uniform lineup of colors among their cases. \nIt’s clear that by reducing the number of bands that are available by default, Apple is making it less confusing for new buyers of the Apple Watch Series 2. It is also possible that Apple is only offering the two bands that are popular, or perhaps simply trying to make more money off of separate purchases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:26:37.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
