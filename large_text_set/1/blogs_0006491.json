There’s been quite a bit of show-stopping pimple-popping material out there that’s kept us pleasantly entertained. Just a few weeks ago, at the beginning of December, Mach5Weird released a video that was three full minutes of pure blackhead popping . It got over 22 million views. Shortly after, all the sickos out there who loved the blackhead show were given even more material to bite into. An 18-second video of a cyst being popped also went viral, and 3 million people found it impossible to look away.\nWe’re here to bring you yet another cyst popping video, only this one is big-league status. A man in Kelowna, Canada had a cyst on his back for 30 years . That’s three decades . He finally got it popped, and of course someone was there to record the ordeal. Viewer discretion is advised.\nDepending on what you’re into, this is either 30-ish seconds of heaven, or hell. This popping actually happened in April, but it just recently spread on the internet like wildfire. It’s pretty gnarly, and we wouldn’t recommend any zit-popping rookies to watch it. The stuff that comes out of that cyst looks like something you would see out of a horror movie (no offense to the patient, who we truly hope found relief from getting that sucker popped).\nIt’s been viewed over a million times already, but we have a feeling this is just the beginning. It’s only going to get more popular as the days go on. Share it with your friends only if you dare.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T03:55:25.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
