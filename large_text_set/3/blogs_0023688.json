Photo: Facebook \nStarting April 3, Detroit skateboarders are going to get a temporary skate experience like no other. A halfpipe is going to be installed inside the three-story, barrel vaulted lobby of the iconic Fisher Building that will be open to the public and only able to be skated until April 6. \nRELATED: 12 times skateboarders creatively utilized nature \nReferred to as “Detroit’s largest art object,” the Fisher Building spared no expenses when it was constructed in 1928 — and nowhere is that more evident than in the gorgeous lobby with frescos adorning the ceiling. \nPlacing a halfpipe for skaters inside a National Historic Historic Landmark like this is a project being undertaken by Everard Findlay and Mkr City. \nFrom their description of the project : \n“Fisher Halfpipe explores the idea of the commons, and the way that certain sports, such as skateboarding, transcend barriers of race, class and culture to draw disparate groups into community. The halfpipe itself will be a monolithic mass bisecting the main arcade of the Fisher Lobby. Patrons will walk through gateways beneath and will be able to view skaters above with the magnificent Fisher as a backdrop, curves of the structure and the arcs of skaters cutting through space mirroring the Fisher’s vaulted, frescoed and inlaid walls and ceilings.” \nCertainly one of the more gorgeous skate park undertakings we’ve come across, albeit temporary, it’s a project that is ultimately going to bring people together and get rid of some perceived stuffiness that could come along with such a magnificent, fancy place. \nRELATED: 5 of the best cities for a skateboard trip \nThere will be an opening event on the evening of April 3, and the halfpipe will be open to skaters till April 6 each evening from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. If you’re a skater in Detroit, we’d advise taking advantage of this incredible opportunity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:27:04.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
