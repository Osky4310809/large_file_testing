Now we may have a hint at why that is: He and his estranged wife , Angelina Jolie , have resolved to turn over a peaceful new leaf in their ongoing divorce drama. In a joint statement to the Associated Press—the couple’s first joint statement since she filed for divorce last September—the former power couple said that, from now on, they will be keeping details of their split private, and working together to parent their six children. \n“The parties and their counsel have signed agreements to preserve the privacy rights of their children and family by keeping all court documents confidential and engaging a private judge to make any necessary legal decisions and to facilitate the expeditious resolution of any remaining issues,” the statement said. “The parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification.” \nFor many Hollywood couples, this might have been the very first post-split statement dispatched to the press. But the shocking Brangelina breakup has been ugly—and über-public—from day one, with swirling rumors of his alcohol and pot abuse; allegations and an ensuing L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services investigation, into whether or not Pitt physically abused their son Maddox, 15, aboard a private plane (he was cleared of all wrongdoing); Jolie filing for sole physical custody; and calls from Pitt (and only Pitt) to seal court documents to protect their privacy. Dueling media narratives alternately lambasted Jolie for trying to smear her ex and bashed Pitt for his alleged downfall. \nThe new statement, however, announces a new way forward. For the sake of what was once one of Hollywood’s most-revered couples —and their brood of six children —here’s hoping it sticks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:50:19.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
