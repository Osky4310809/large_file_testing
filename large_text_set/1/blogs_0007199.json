David Nevins, the premium network's president, revealed that fans can expect the continuation of the early '90s cult series to pick up on May 21. The premiere will kick off an 18-episode run. \n\"It's really happening,\" Nevins said, according to Deadline. \"It will be 18 unforgettable hours.\" \nAlthough \"Twin Peaks\" lovers have gotten used to waiting, they won't have to do so at first. Showtime has opted for a two-hour premiere, and on top of that, Episodes 3 and 4 will be available on Showtime's digital platform immediately after the two parts air. From there, though, the waiting game begins again. \nWith \"Twin Peaks\" co-creator and director David Lynch being a proponent of weekly TV, new episodes will come once a week after the early batch, Nevins shared. The show will follow many familiar faces, including FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper ( Kyle MacLachlan ) and FBI Agent Gordon Cole (Lynch). The season is \"about Agent Dale Cooper's odyssey to Twin Peaks,\" Nevins said. \nThe 18-episode installment is designed as a limited series, but Nevins didn't completely shut the door on the idea of more \"Twin Peaks,\" according to Deadline. Before worrying about the series' future, though, we'll enjoy Season 3. \nGet a slice of cherry pie ready for Showtime's \"Twin Peaks\" premiere on May 21 at 9 pm.
