He says that he discovered the romance once he started transcribing the letters.\nHignett initially purchased three letters for his museum, but later purchased the remaining 277 letters for Â£1,000 ($1,242) to unearth the entire story.\nSee photos to this story \n\nThe 300-letter collection detailed the love between soldier Gilbert Bradley and his lover -- who signed the letters with the initial \"G\". Decades later it was discovered that his pen pal's name was Gordon.\nDuring WWII, Bradley was on military training and seemingly in love with Gordon, Hignett says. At the time, however, homosexuality was outlawed in the military, and soldiers could be shot for engaging in activity deemed homosexual.\nHere is a sample from the collection:\nWednesday January 24th 1939 \nMy darling, \n... I lie awake all night waiting for the postman in the early morning, and then when he does not bring anything from you I just exist, a mass of nerves... \nAll my love forever, \nG. \nThe letters reveal Bradley's reluctance to serve as a soldier. At one point, Bradley apparently even pretended to have epilepsy to avoid being drafted into the Army.\nSEE ALSO: Judge didn't ask, she told: Why the U.S. must let gays serve openly \nBut he was unsuccessful in his efforts and stationed at Park Hall Camp in Oswestry, Shropshire, in 1939 to train as an anti-aircraft gunner.\nThe love notes also appear to show that Bradley was in love with Gordon Bowsher before being drafted. The two met in 1938 at party when Bowsher was actually dating Bradley's nephew.\nThis information piqued Hignett's interest who compares his experience reading the letters to reading a book: \"I just had to keep buying the letters to find out what happened next.\"\n\"Such letters are extremely rare because they were incriminating - gay men faced years in prison with or without hard labour,\" Hignett says. \"There was even the possibility that gay soldiers could have been shot.\"\nHignett confirms that book preparations are already under way to accompany the letter display in the museum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:07:09.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
