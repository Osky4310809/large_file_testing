(J. Scott Applewhite/AP) Former Republican senator Daniel Coats of Indiana received the backing of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday to become the nation’s spy chief, clearing the way for a likely confirmation vote next week on the Senate floor.\nTrump’s pick to serve as director of national intelligence earned the support of 16 of 18 members of the committee, most of whom were his colleagues during his tenure in the Senate, which ended just months ago. First-term Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) announced on Twitter that she was one of the two members of the panel who voted against him, “after careful consideration of his record and testimony.”\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) was the other vote against him.\nDuring his confirmation hearing last month , Coats refused to pledge to Wyden that he would tell Congress how many Americans are under government surveillance for the content of their communications before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act needs to be reauthorized at the end of the year.\nCoats did pledge to work with committee senators to aid their investigation of Russia and to “follow the law” prohibiting the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. But he also said he believed more discussion about the potential efficacy of such interrogation practices in certain situations was needed.\nCoats also said he would try to look for ways to increase efficiency and effectiveness of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence — but rejected any “efforts to keep the size of the ODNI in check.”\nCommittee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Vice Chairman Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) both voted to approve Coats’s nomination.\nBurr said that the full Senate vote on Coats’s confirmation would likely be Wednesday.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@karoun"], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:07:02.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
