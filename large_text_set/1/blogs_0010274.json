The Science of Fall \nOn the fall equinox, the sun’s direct rays strike along the equator (0° latitude) and Earth’s axis is equidistant (it isn't tilted toward or away) from the sun. While this is also true of the spring equinox, the difference in spring weather versus fall weather comes from how our planet faces the sun on these two equinox dates. Since Earth travels eastward around the sun, on the autumnal equinox, the Northern Hemisphere is transitioning from direct to indirect sunlight (that is, we experience cooling temperatures). The Return of Standard Time (and that Coveted Extra Hour of Sleep) \nAs early as late August, you may notice that the mornings aren't as brightly lit as they were at summer's start, and that the evenings are getting darker earlier. This is because during fall, the days become increasingly shorter and nighttime arrives noticeably earlier. To coordinate our daily lives with this change in daylight/nighttime we adjust our time clocks accordingly and \"fall back\" (gain an hour) as we switch from Daylight Saving to Standard Time. Do You Call it \"Fall\" or \"Autumn\"? \nHave you ever noticed that fall is the only season that has two names -- \"fall\" and \"autumn\"? \nThe use of \"autumn\" dates back to the late 14th century when it was adopted into the English language from the French automne . The term \"fall,\" which refers to the dropping of tree leaves at this time of year, appeared around the 17th century. While both titles have been used since the 18th century, \"fall\" is thought to be more popular in the United States thanks to its younger, more poetic feel at a time when the English language was being spread to the American continent. Back in Britain, however, the more traditional \"autumn\" won out. \nWhich do you say, and does what you call it match where you're from?
