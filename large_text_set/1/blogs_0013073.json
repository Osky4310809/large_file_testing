Douglas also earned gold in the all-around, becoming the first gymnast in American history to win the gold medal in both the team and all-around. After some time off after the Olympics, in the spring of 2014 Douglas began to train for a competitive comeback . She was a junior talent and then trained alongside an Olympic champion. \nDouglas qualified to the 2010 junior US Championships, and placed a very impressive fourth all-around at nationals that year. She was named to the 2010 Pan American Championships team, where she took first on bars and helped USA win the team competition. \nAfter her early success as an elite, Douglas decided to switch coaches. She met Liang Chow, coach of 2008 Olympian Shawn Johnson , at a coaching clinic and moved to Iowa to work with him at his gym, Chow's Gymnastics and Dance. \ncontinue reading below our video Profile of Shawn Johnson She trained alongside Johnson until Johnson's retirement from the sport in June of 2012. She was the youngest gymnast in the competition at her first worlds. \nThough originally the alternate to the world team, when an abdominal injury sidelined team member Anna Li, Douglas ended up on the roster. With a Dec. 31st birthday, Douglas was the youngest gymnast in the meet, but excelled at her first worlds. She competed on all four events in prelims and ended up fifth all-around after the competition was over. Unfortunately, due to the two-per-country rule , only two US gymnasts could advance to the all-around finals . American teammates Jordyn Wieber and Aly Raisman ranked higher (second and fourth, respectively). \nDouglas did qualify to the bars finals, however, and placed fifth, even with an error. ( Watch her bar routine .) She had a break-out meet at the 2012 American Cup -- and then won the Olympic Trials. \nIn 2012, Douglas had a huge performance at the American Cup in March. She competed as the US team alternate, so her scores didn't officially count, but she ended up with the highest total of the day. Had she been an \"official\" competitor, she would have beaten world all-around gold medalist Wieber. \nThen Douglas edged Wieber for the overall title at the 2012 Olympic Trials, finishing just .1 ahead of her after the two-day competition. Douglas therefore earned the single automatic berth onto the Olympic team (though she would have undoubtedly been selected onto the team anyways). Beating Wieber also showed that she was a legitimate contender for the Olympic all-around title as well. She was the star of the 2012 Olympics. \nDouglas was the unofficial MVP of team USA at the London Games. She performed so well in prelims that she qualified to the individual all-around, bars, and beam finals. She competed on all four events for the US in the team finals, and amassed an enormous 61.465 total all-around score. She was a huge part of team USA's gold medal victory. \nIn the all-around final, Douglas topped even her all-around score from team finals, earning a 62.232 and winning the all-around gold medal. Douglas had two more chances to medal in the event finals of bars and of beam, but finished eighth and seventh, respectively. She's back -- and still one of the best in the world. \nAfter some time off after London, Douglas announced she'd be returning to training in April of 2014 with the goal of competing at the Rio Olympics in 2016. She competed in her first world championships since 2011 in October of 2015 and earned an impressive second place all-around behind three-time world champ (and US teammate) Simone Biles . She also helped the US team win its third consecutive team title. She does some cool skills. \nDouglas competes a sky-high piked reverse hecht (at :59) on bars, and a standing back full (at :19) on beam. She also did an Amanar vault , which she's hoping to regain by Rio. She likes floor and beam -- and knitting. \nGabrielle Douglas was born on December 31, 1995 to Timothy Douglas and Natalie Hawkins. Her hometown is Virginia Beach, Va., and she started gymnastics in 2002. Douglas has two older sisters – Arielle and Joyelle – and an older brother Johnathan. \nDouglas names floor and beam as her favorite events, and goes by the nicknames Gabby and Brie. Douglas enjoys reading and knitting in her free time.
