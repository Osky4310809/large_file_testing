To do so is to risk children’s protection and the department’s duty of care,” Ms Walsh said. \nEven if, as defenders of the program say, everything is on the up and up, there’s still so much room for abuse. If the line of objectivity was crossed, who would stop it? It’s a problem that really needs regulation. Without it, it’s not worth keeping during the school day. \nIt gets worse: \nThe FIRIS group has been given a boost in its NSW campaign by inner west parents displeased by the expansion of SRE into the inner city Sydney Secondary College for the first time this year; and a contentious change of timetable that put SRE in the middle of the day at Fort Street in Petersham last year. \n… \nUnder department policy, students not enrolled in SRE can not have any other classes while SRE is on. This meant hundreds of Fort Street students were wasting time while just eight received SRE classes. (Enrolment may have increased this year.) \nSounds like a waste of real educational time. All the more reason to get rid of those classes for good. \n(Thanks to Julie for the link)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:26:47.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
