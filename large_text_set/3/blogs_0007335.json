Why should I subsidize that? WiscoNative \nBecause healthcare is FAR more expensive than a phone, so it’s not as though it’s “one or the other.” AND many people actually need smartphones for their jobs. It’s not a luxury anymore, it’s just expected that people will be able to call/email/connect any time of day. Jreed1235 \nIf you want someone else to pay for your healthcare, you have no business buying some of the most expensive commodities on earth… priorities. WiscoNative \nA smartphone isn’t all that expensive (compared to a computer, or healthcare premiums, or a car, etc.), and in many ways it’s necessary to be a member of society. People are expected to bring their own devices to work, they’re expected to have internet access at all times to reply to emails, and many people are expected to be on-call and that requires a cell phone. \nFor their price, smartphones are some of the absolute best things someone can buy, allowing them access to huge amounts of data and rapid contact with almost anyone. Smartphones aren’t a luxury anymore, they’re a necessity. Justin Harbaugh \nHe’s got a point, really. Tallest Skil \nPut me in charge of food stamps. I’d get rid of Lone Star cards–no cash for Ding Dongs or Ho Ho’s, just money for 50 pound bags of rice and beans, blocks of cheese, and all the powdered milk you can haul away. If you want steak and frozen pizza, then get a job. Put me in charge of Medicaid. The first thing I’d do is to get women Norplant birth control implants or tubal ligations. Then we’ll test recipients for drugs, alcohol, and nicotine and document all tattoos and piercings. If you want to reproduce, use drugs, alcohol, smoke, or get tats and piercings, then get a job. \nPut me in charge of government housing. Ever live in a military barracks? You will maintain our property in a clean and good state of repair. Your “home” will be subject to inspections anytime and possessions will be inventoried. If you want a plasma TV or Xbox 360, then get a job and your own place. In addition, you will either present a check stub from a job each week or you will report to a “government” job. It may be cleaning the roadways of trash, painting and repairing public housing, whatever we find for you. We will sell your 22 inch rims, low profile tires, and your blasting stereo and speakers and put that money toward the “common good.” \nBefore you write that I’ve violated someone’s rights, realize that all of the above is voluntary. If you want our money, accept our rules. Before you say that this would be “demeaning” and ruin their “self-esteem,” consider that it wasn’t that long ago that taking someone else’s money for doing absolutely nothing was demeaning and lowered self-esteem. If we are expected to pay for other people’s mistakes, we should at least attempt to make them learn from their bad choices. The current system rewards them for continuing to make bad choices. Larry Fulkner \n“We will sell your 22 inch rims, low profile tires, and your blasting stereo and speakers and put that money toward the “common good” \nWHAT! Really. This is purely one of the most idiotic statement, filled with some of the most neanderthal level stereotypes I’ve ever seen. How the hell did a statement like this make it to this site. \nFoolishness. Tallest Skil \nGreat argument, kid. Explain why you get to steal taxpayer money and use it on shit you neither need nor deserve. WiscoNative \n“I’d get rid of Lone Star cards–no cash for Ding Dongs or Ho Ho’s, just money for 50 pound bags of rice and beans, blocks of cheese, and all the powdered milk you can haul away. If you want steak and frozen pizza” — Also known as “if you’re poor or unfortunate, I get to control what you eat. Nothing enjoyable for you!” \n“then get a job” — This is great advice for people who might have medical conditions preventing them from working. Should they just starve? Should they settle for the cheapest things our society has to offer? \n“Before you write that I’ve violated someone’s rights, realize that all of the above is voluntary.” — You’re not violating any rights, you’re just being a wildly selfish, controlling person who thinks that “our money” is more important than someone else having a good quality of life. Learn some compassion. Tallest Skil \nYou have absolutely no fucking comprehension of what was written or what it covers.
