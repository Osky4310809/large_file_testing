Until now. But it’s not what you’d expect. Amy Schumer gets honest about her weight. (Photo: Getty Images) More “I am what Hollywood calls very fat,” Schumer begins in a segment of her new Netflix special , Amy Schumer: The Leather Special . “You know me, I feel very good in my own skin. I feel strong, I feel healthy, I feel sexy,” she says, describing exactly what we love most about her. And while she also looked fabulous in her first film, Trainwreck , she wasn’t as comfortable as usual. Believe it or not, she was asked to shed some pounds for the film. Well, not asked, per se — it was suggested. Strongly. “Somebody, like, explained to me, ‘Just so you know, Amy, no pressure, but if you weigh over 140 pounds, it will hurt people’s eyes,’” she recalls, pinpointing exactly what is wrong with Hollywood. She, and any proud, healthy woman, could never hurt our eyes. Unfortunately, as a newcomer to the big screen, she drank the Kool-Aid … or should we say kale juice? “I just bought it. I was like, OK, I’m new to town.’ So I lost weight.” But the whole going crazy to lose weight thing just wasn’t for her. “I believe you should be healthy and take care of yourself, but I don’t believe in crash-dieting or starving yourself.” Photo: Everett Collection More But there she was, a few sizes smaller, making her first movie. And while most celebrities will say they lost weight and feel great, Schumer isn’t sugarcoating it. She did not like her new slender self. “I look very stupid skinny,” Schumer says, inciting uproarious laughter from the crowd. “My dumb head stays the same size, but then my body, like, shrivels. … Nobody likes it. It’s not cute on me.” So what did she do when the film wrapped? “I just revenge-ate as soon as the movie was over.” There’s that awesome and honest comedian we know and love. Photo: Everett Collection More Read More And even though she is comfortable in her thicker-than-Kardashian skin, she’s not immune to the pressures of Hollywood. “I got worried because it gets in your head, just everything on television and movies and the Internet. All the women are just beautiful little skeletons with tits. All day I’m looking at the Hadid sisters and those Jenner things…” she says hilariously, “and I got worried.” So she works out. No, she does not vigorously run on the treadmill while flipping through images of Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner. “My workouts are like a woman in hospice,” she describes. “Before I work out, I go and buy a scone and then I walk around the reservoir and I eat it.” That sounds like the perfect workout. In fact, can you make it an official thing? Because we’ll be there faster than you can say cranberry apple cinnamon scone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:51:48.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
