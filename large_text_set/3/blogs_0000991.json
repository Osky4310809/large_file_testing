Bruno Barde, the festival’s artistic director, said the recent attacks have had an impact on attendance. Another factor is timing as Deauville is sandwiched between Venice and Toronto film festivals which lure some of the biggest U.S. indie films and talent. \nThe tribute to Tucci was followed by the French premiere of “Free States of Jones.” Matthew McConaughey was not in Deauville to present the movie because he’s currently shooting a film, said the distributor, Metropolitan Filmexport. \nMichael Moore, who was being honored today, canceled his attendance earlier this week for “personal reasons.” His tribute was followed by a screening “Where to Invade Next.” Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:22:00.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
