major snub to thin-skinned Commander in Chief who wanted to 'do one better' than Barack Obama – who became the first US President to address MPs in the chamber in 2011   23:23 BST Click to followIndy Politics Over a million people have signed a petition calling for the government to cancel Mr Trump's state visit Carlos Barria/Reuters \nDonald Trump could be denied the honour of addressing MPs in Parliament’s ancient Westminster Hall as controversy over his state visit mounts. \nMPs are due to debate cancelling the new President’s official visit to the UK later this year following outrage over his ban on all citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries coming to the US after a petition was signed by nearly 2m people. \nBut a potential compromise has emerged where Mr Trump would not be allowed to deliver a speech in the 11th century hall, the oldest and most prestigious part of the Palace of Westminster, and instead speak in the Royal Gallery in the House of Lords – which was built 800 years later and is currently covered in scaffolding. \nThe move would be a major snub to Mr Trump as Westminster Hall, where Winston Churchill lay in state and Charles I was tried for treason, is traditionally reserved for the most respected world leaders such as Nelson Mandela , Aung San Suu Kyri, Pope Benedict XVI and Barack Obama. Read more \nThere is a plaque on the floor of the hall commemorating the speech Mr Obama delivered to both Houses of Parliament when he became the first US President ever to address them in 2011. \nThe solution was reportedly proposed by Speaker John Bercow who is said to be “not happy” about the level of MPs concerns about the idea, the Sunday Telegraph reported. \nIt came after 150 MPs signed a statement calling for Mr Trump to be denied a parliamentary address. \nRonald Reagan and Bill Clinton also had to make do with the Royal Gallery but the snub would be damaging to the ego of the notoriously thin-skinned Commander in Chief.
