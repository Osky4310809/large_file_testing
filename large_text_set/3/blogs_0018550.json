In it, Tipton-Martin walks through over 150 cookbooks authored by black women in the States, women whose greater imprints on American home cooking have largely been ignored. It is expansive, exhaustively-researched, and vividly written. ♥ + Freda DeKnight Was a Pioneer for African-American Cooking by Mayukh Sen \nTipton-Martin was rightly showered with a number of accolades for The Jemima Code , including a James Beard award. Without her work, the names of many of the women Tipon-Martin discusses may have well disappeared from our memory for good. Case in point: Tipton-Martin’s book was one of, I don’t know, three books that even deigned to mention Princess Pamela and her 1969 Soul Food Cookbook , and I referred to it frequently when writing my profile of her .

Yesterday, she launched a GoFundMe asking for help on her project —she’s one book way from recovering the first editions of over 350 African-American-authored cookbooks stretching as far back as 1827. ♥ + She Was a Soul Food Sensation. Then, 19 Years Ago, She Disappeared. by Mayukh Sen \nAs books fall out of print, they tend to become more expensive. So it’s crucial to continue supporting work like Tipton-Martin's, especially when it isn't exactly easy to secure funding for this scholarship through more traditional channels. There are few scholars whose work preserving America’s culinary cultural heritage is as important as hers, and I can't wait to see what Tipton-Martin does next. \nHave you read The Jemima Code ?
