Al Sharpton’s daughter and Eric Garner’s mom — were told Monday that their cases would be dropped if they stayed out of trouble.\nAshley Sharpton, the divisive holy man’s youngest daughter, and Gwen Carr — whose son died in 2014 after Staten Island cop placed him in a chokehold — were arraigned on disorderly conduct charges in Manhattan Criminal Court.\n​​\nBoth women were part of a group busted for sitting on Fifth Avenue on Jan. 31 to block traffic while protesting Trump’s supreme court justice nominee Neil Gorsuch, whose confirmation hearing is slated to begin Monday.\nProsecutors offered to dismiss their cases in six months if they stayed out of trouble — known in legal parlance as an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal.\nThe daughter of the Harlem civil rights leader said her dad was proud of her roadway activism.\n“He teased me and called me a jail bird but said it’s our duty,” Ashley Sharpton, 29, said as she left the courthouse.\nCarr, 67, who has been highly critical of the commander in chief and even campaigned for Hillary Clinton, said it was important to speak up. “We can’t just stand by and say nothing and let the Trump administration just take advantage of this country,” she said.\nAll 16 protesters, some of whom were arrested in front of Trump Tower Jan. 20 for blocking traffic during a demonstration against the President’s inauguration, took the deal.\nBoth protests were organized by Al Sharpton’s civil rights organization the National Action Network.\nThe arrested protesters included state senator Marisol Alcantara; councilman Jumaane Williams; councilman Carlos Menchaca; Rev. Johnnie Green of Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem; Minister Kirsten John Foy of NAN; Katrina Jefferson, NAN NYC chapter liaison; the Rev. Kevin McCall of NAN; and Patrice Perry, who is a member of NAN.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:13:29.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
