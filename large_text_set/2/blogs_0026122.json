GETTY He is an outspoken advocate for animals \nThe maximum six-month sentence in England and Wales is one of the lowest penalties in Europe and has allowed vile and dangerous criminals to commit crimes that have shocked the nation with only a pitiful slap on the wrist from the judicial system. \nLast year, the Express launched its Cruelty Crusade to increase maximum sentences in the wake of public outrage after two brothers from Redcar were given suspended sentences for abusing their pet bulldog called Baby. \nRedcar MP Anna Turley later queued through the night to table her Animal Cruelty (Sentencing) Bill , which get its second reading at the Commons tomorrow. \nKevin Foster MP’s Animal Fighting (Sentencing), aimed at overhauling legislation that dates back to 1911, will also be discussed. \nThe League Against Cruel Sports has been campaigning to replace the maximum sentence first introduced under the Edwardian Protection of Animals Act with a minimum three-year penalty for those found guilty of dog fighting. \nIt also wants a national database of individuals banned from owning animals to prevent others falling victim. \nIt was while looking into the evils of dog fighting with its Project Bloodline investigation that the League uncovered the story of Cupcake the Staffordshire bull terrier and the heartbreaking abuse she suffered at the hands of dog fighters. \nVets say rescued Cupcake shows the classic signs of dog fighting trauma. She had eye damage, her teeth had been broken to short stumps and part of her tongue was missing. \nCupcake will be at Westminster tomorrow when MPs discuss shaking up the laws that would have seen her tormentors facing a mere six months behind bars. \nLeague Against Cruel Sports chief executive Eduardo Gonçalves said: “Cases like Cupcake’s are unfortunately not isolated, through our on-going dog fighting investigation we have learnt of other cases where dogs have been forced to fight or bred to fuel this clandestine activity. \n\"Many are not as lucky as Cupcake and will have died before being given any hope of a second chance at a happy life. GRAPHIC CONTENT: Worst cases of animal cruelty Mon, November 28, 2016 WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: As part of our new 'STOP THE CRUELTY' campaign we take a look at some of the most horrific cases animal cruelty. PA 1 of 32 Handout photo issued by the Orangutan Foundation of Aan, a critically-endangered orangutan who was blinded after being shot more than 100 times with an air rifle. Aan is to undergo an operation that could restore her sight. \n“The current maximum sentence of six months’ imprisonment for animal cruelty in England and Wales is quite simply a joke. \n\"This leaves us lagging embarrassingly behind almost every other country in Europe. If the law is going to serve any purpose of acting as a deterrent, the time must fit the severity of the crime. \n“The animal cruelty sentencing bills lay down an important marker for how animal cruelty can be tackled. \n\"With cross party MPs supporting tougher sentencing, we hope it won’t be long before the Government acts and ensures justice for animals suffering terrible abuse. \n“Dog fighting is repugnant, despite being banned almost 200 years ago it is still going on and we need to stamp this out for good. How can we tackle this issue? \n\"Aside from increasing the maximum sentence to a minimum of three years, the League is calling for dog fighting to become a recordable crime, and for the implementation of a national database of Individuals banned from keeping animals to enforce the law and prevent further animals from becoming victims.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:29:05.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
