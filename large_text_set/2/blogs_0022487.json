But even after facing more than $70 billion in debt, Puerto Rico never got an ay bendito from Congress — until this week. \nIn a 68-30 bipartisan vote , the Senate passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act known by its acronym PROMESA (promise in English). To combat the island’s debt crisis the measure — now signed by the president — establishes a federal control board, a process for restructuring debt and expedited procedures for approving critical infrastructure projects. \nThere’s been a lot of pushback from my fellow islanders, and I get it. We’re not a full-fledged-state, yet the federal government thinks it can come in and dictate how things will be run. It’s a sort of flashback to the pre-Luis Muñoz Marin era, when Puerto Rico had appointed leaders. \nBut here’s the thing, the fact that the island is in this awful situation is as much a fault of Congress as it is of local leaders. And so Washington has a responsibility to find a solution. \nAfter Spain ceded the territory to the U.S. in 1898, Puerto Rico’s economy was actually booming. Then the U.S. imposed a series of labor regulations, welfare benefits and subsidies. Guess what happens when government intervenes too heavily with the market? Chaos. Since the Spain-U.S. transition, the U.S. has been pulling every regulatory trick to try to manufacture a thriving economy — every trick except stepping back, deregulating and letting the market sort itself out. \nToday, nearly half of all Puerto Ricans on the island qualify for some kind of federal assistance. Puerto Ricans know first-hand that whenever the government gives a handout, it’s paying for it with someone else’s money. Well, time to pay up. \nThat’s not to say that local government has not added to the problem. Corruption, mismanagement of federal funds and government growth have all played a part. I’ve lived through six different administrations, and the only attempt at balancing the budget generated the biggest discontent in the island I had seen. Governor Luis Fortuño, in an attempt to cut government expenses, established Ley 7 , which laid off more than 30,000 public employees. Everyone knew someone who got fired. \nAnd as much as it pains me to say it, that was a good economic decision on his part (clearly not politically). But that’s what a good leader does. You don’t pander or point fingers , like our current governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, keeps doing. You roll up your sleeves and try to fix the problem at hand. \nAfter Gov. Garcia Padilla announced the default last year, two Puerto Rican public agencies defaulted . Later on, the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico missed a $400 million payment. And finally, a $1 billion payment due on Friday will likely be another default. Clearly, we need help. \nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media \nI am not one to support federal officials meddling in local issues, but they had a part in creating this mess just as much we did. Besides, the toll Puerto Rico must pay is a balanced budget for five years. Only then will the control board step back. Is that so hard? \nGarcia Padilla was waiting for a cash bailout and bankruptcy, but he’s getting a debt restructuring instead, which is how bankruptcy for Puerto Rico would work anyway. The key factor here is that he’s not getting cash. Nor should he. Our local government, including him, has proven incapable of avoiding the same traps it has fallen into before. Who’s to say Puerto Rico won’t just keep needing bailout after bailout? To fix the problem you have to start at the root, and while PROMESA may not be the solution to every problem, at least Congress took the right first step (shocking, right?). \nNow that President Obama has signed the bill, Puerto Ricans need not take this as a superimposed mandate, but accept it as the help we’ve been clamoring for. There’s no room for ay bendito anymore. If we truly believe Puerto Rico lo hace mejor (does it better), then let’s work hand-in-hand to lift ourselves up. Congress put the ball in our court, and although we don’t have much of a choice to disagree, let’s take it in good faith. Those of us who left and those still on the island would like to see the Star Island shine again. \nJosh Rivera, USA TODAY’s Your Say editor and a member of the editorial board, grew up in Puerto Rico. \nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors .
