Annie Leibovitz/Handout via Reuters \nLONDON — A man from the US has taken out a giant ad in The Times claiming to be the rightful King of England. \nAllan V. Evans from Colorado, US, says that he is a descendant of a royal Welsh line from the 3rd century. \nThe ad, shown below in a tweet, says that Evans is \"a direct descendant of an unbroken primogeniture line legally documented since the 3rd century in Great Britain and registered in the Royal College of Arms.\" \nIt goes on to describe generations of lineage, starting with a claim that Evans is the descendant of Cunedda Wledig, the founder of the Kingdom of Wales. \nEvans is giving \"legal notice\" to all of his relatives, according to the ad, and in 30 days plans to claim his \"royal historic estate,\" as well as land, assets, and titles. \nAn American has taken out a big ad in the Times to say he's the rightful king & intends to seize power. pic.twitter.com/ba1iQUyGer — DavidMapstone (@DavidMapstone) March 1, 2017 \nBut Evans will not claim his right to the throne until the death of Queen Elizabeth II. \nHe \"shall further pursue an injustice of history by claiming by right the throne and sovereign crown of Great Britain at Westminster, upon whence the sad future death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, as he will not out of greatest and most deepest respect despose her in life for the great service and selfless sacrifice that she and her husband HRH Prince Philip has rendered to this great nation.\" \nIt goes on: \"Take heed and rejoice, all Welshman, Scots, Manx, all Britons, and all citizens of this great nation called Great Britain, that the light of freedom and egalitarianism shall be promoted and promulgated, that democracy and all democratic values will be promoted, and that Lady Britania who has contributed so much to the culture and history of the world shall be renewed and made great once again; for the legend was not a myth but was indeed true, and more than a mere Tolkien story, that the men of the West are now returning and now is the time of the return of the King.\" \nAccording to The Independent , a man called Allan V. Evans from Wheat Ridge, Colorado, attempted to claim 400 acres of land in Twiggs county in 2012, claiming that his ancestors had lived there. He said his evidence was destroyed in a fire at the county courthouse in 1901.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T08:40:44.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
