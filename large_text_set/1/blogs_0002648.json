But can anyone really blame him?\nOnce a video of Roker’s excitement was shared, the Internet exploded with retweets and agreement of “how cute are those dogs?” — because how cute are these surfing dogs that you are about to see?! Clearly the surfing dogs were the highlight of the event – but the Rose Parade also featured 22 marching bands, over 400 horses, and 44 floats. All in all, it was a very festive (and dog-loving) start to the new year.\nal roker being SUPER EXCITED about these surfing dogs is my favorite part of 2017 so far pic.twitter.com/yngrxewsEX \n— human bean (@leahgardiner7) January 2, 2017 And here is how deeply people loved these dogs and their ~xtreme~ water sports.\n2017 goal: be the happy that @alroker is when he sees dogs surfing during the #RoseParade #nbcroseparade \n— Liz Nemrava (@nemrover) January 2, 2017 Just show the dogs surfing for another hour seriously this is what we need in 2017 to unite us all amen\n— josh groban (@joshgroban) January 2, 2017 Jerod Harris/WireImage AMEN.
