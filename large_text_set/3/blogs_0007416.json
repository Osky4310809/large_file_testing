(AP Photo/Tony Dejak, File) The Associated Press +1 \nThere have been retail casualties after every holiday shopping season — and that's been especially true as more consumers have gone online to buy. \nBut 2017 appears to be turning into a particularly tough year for traditional brick-and-mortar stores, including several that expanded in the St. Louis market in recent years. \nA few chains have closed, several are in bankruptcy (or on their way), and even long-established businesses have had to retrench. \nHeadlines to come are unlikely to be any better: On March 1, S&P warned that the outlook for the U.S. retail sector was looking increasingly negative with 20 negative rating actions already taken this year. \nHere's a summary of some of our recent coverage: \nMarch 7 • Mall-based apparel chain Vanity Shop plans to close 137 stores in 27 states including Missouri and Illinois through bankruptcy liquidation, the company announced Tuesday. Three St. Louis area stores are among those affected. \nMarch 6 • Appliances and electronics retailer HHGregg Inc. and its Gregg Appliances Inc. unit filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, as they continued to struggle with declining sales for about four years. The company's 132 stores would operate normally throughout the restructuring process. It said last week it would shut 88 stores, including one in Chesterfield. \nMarch 6 • Gordmans Stores , a Midwestern department-store chain founded more than a century ago, is preparing to file for bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the matter. \nMarch 3 • General Wireless Operations, the RadioShack successor created by a partnership between Sprint Corp. and the defunct retailer's owners, is preparing to file for bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the matter. \nMarch 3 • Neiman Marcus has hired investment bank Lazard Ltd. to explore ways to bolster its balance sheet as it seeks relief from a $4.9 billion debt pile, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. \nFeb. 24 • J.C. Penney announced on Friday its biggest number of stores closings in recent history and indicated the decision will result in it exiting some smaller markets. Penney said it will close 130 to 140 stores over the next few months. \nFeb. 23 • Family Christian , the nation's biggest Christian bookstore chain, said on Thursday it was going out of business and planned to close its 240 stores across 36 states. The chain's website lists four locations in the St. Louis area. \nFeb. 17 • MC Sports filed for bankruptcy this week and will begin liquidation sales at all 68 of its stores. Grand Rapids, Mich.-based MC Sports has three Missouri locations, in Columbia, Springfield and Warrensburg. MC Sports also has three Illinois stores: Forsyth, Bloomington and East Peoria. \nFeb. 14 • Hunting and fishing chain Gander Mountain Co. is preparing to file for bankruptcy as early as this month, after an aggressive effort to expand its store base failed to pull in new customers, according to people familiar with the matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:17:20.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
