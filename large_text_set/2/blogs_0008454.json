The extended family, all things considered, they’re doing well. They’re very sad. They all have great stories and great memories of him. He did come back occasionally to visit,” Smith said. “They want to thank everyone for the outpouring of cards and notes that they have received.” \nSmith said the cards have been sent to the America’s Gold Star Families organization, and she’s already given dozens of cards to the family. \n“I will tell you they’re coming in daily. They have quite a pile already, and I’ve been taking them to them, and it’s been a great comfort,” she said. \nOwens was 36. He died on Jan. 29, in a covert raid against al Qaeda in Yemen. \nHe was the first U.S. combat casualty since President Donald Trump took office in January. \nThe raid left nearly 30 others dead, including suspected terror leaders, and civilian women and children. \nAnyone who wants to send a card to the Owens family can address it to: \nAmerica’s Gold Star Families ATTN: Navy SEAL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:59:02.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
