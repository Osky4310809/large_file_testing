He set numerous records, from pass attempts (62) to completions (43) to yards (466), putting together one of the greatest performances in a Super Bowl in recent memory. \nBrady had a brief exchange with Roger Goodell after the win on the field Sunday, but on Monday morning he was given the MVP trophy from the commissioner. It was a bit awkward initially, but they posed for pictures with the hardware on the stage. \nHere was the hand-off from Goodell to Brady after he was called up to take the MVP trophy. Couldn’t get the Facebook Live feed to work. Here’s the video of Goodell giving Brady the MVP trophy pic.twitter.com/r85dbN6ZZa \n— Ben Volin (@BenVolin) February 6, 2017 \nOf course, the awkwardness between them stems from Deflategate, which netted Brady a four-game suspension. Brady returned from his early-season ban to go 11-1 in 12 starts, then running the table in the postseason to win Super Bowl LI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:28:12.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
