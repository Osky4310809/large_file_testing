Several shocked revelers were seen fleeing the scene after the attack and the music fell silent. \nThe club is located close to recent suicide attacks that killed dozens near a soccer stadium. \nIstanbul had already been under heavy security surveillance during the festivities, with police mounting machine guns and armored vehicles parked on the streets. \nSecurity measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital Ankara. \nIn Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were put on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, state news agency Anadolu reported. \nAnkara and Istanbul have been targeted by several attacks in 2016 carried out by the Islamic State group or Kurdish rebels, killing more than 180 people. \n(AP)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T04:33:56.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
