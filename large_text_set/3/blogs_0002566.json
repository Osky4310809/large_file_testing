Ã‚ \nASSEMBLY ELECTIONS 2017: FULL COVERAGE \nSpread across seven phases, campaigning for Uttar Pradesh Assembly election saw political parties being involved in most acrimonious slugfest one has witnessed in the recent political history of the country. \nFor the BJP, it is a matter of prestige. A win in the one the most populous states of the country would certainly give a boost to its 2019 plans. The party knows it and that precisely why almost the entire Modi Cabinet was camping in Varanasi ahead of the last phase election on March 8. \nPM Modi's constituency Varanasi transformed into a big battleground in the last few days witnessing massive rallies, roadshows from the two big players - the BJP and Samajwadi-Congress combine. \nCAMPAIGNING FOR LAST PHASE OF UP ELECTION ENDS: THINGS TO KNOW: On the last day of campaigning, PM Modi visited Gadwaghat Ashram, a move many described as an attempt to woo Yadav voters. Reports say the ashram has a huge following and also a potent force when it come to political decision making among the Yadavs. PM Modi also visited the ancestral house of former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri at Ramnagar before addressing a rally at Rohaniya. \"The UP government is anti-farmer. Why they don't help farmers in distress,\" Modi said attacking the Akhilesh government. Voting on 40 Assembly seats in seven districts will be held on March 8. The seven districts going to polls in this phase are Ghazipur, Varanasi, Jaunpur, Chandauli, Mirzapur, Bhadoi and Sonebhadra. The districts collectively known as Poorvanchal hold the key for the BJP. The party has to perform outstandingly well if it has to form the next government in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP hopes to sweep eastern Uttar Pradesh to get close to the magic figure mark of 202 in the 403-seat Assembly. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has been camping in Varanasi for the last three days. He held back-to-back roadshows and rallies in the city.
