The brothers will be closely followed for at least four more years.\nKelly and his brother Mark Kelly, who served as the test’s control, agreed to help scientists learn more about the effects of space on one’s body. The latest results were presented at the annual meeting of the Human Research Program in Galveston\nKelly spent 340 days in space before returning home in March 2016. TIME covered the Kelly brothers’ mission extensively in an Emmy-nominated 12-episode series, which can be viewed at time.com/space .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T03:16:41.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
