Three years of paying for tuition, food, and accommodation without an income can be tricky for some students, even with the help of a student loan. \nMarket Inspector , a B2B digital marketplace has compiled a ranking of the UK's most expensive universities by combining the cost of everything from insurance to rent to books, to give a good idea of the overall cost of a year at university for the average British undergrad. \nMost universities on the list are in London and the south east of England, where the cost of rent is a bigger expense than anywhere else in the country. However, some are outside the capital in other major cities around the country. \nOne private university — where tuition fees are almost double the £9,250 paid by undergraduates at public universities — features highly on the list. \nCheck it out below: \n17. The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama \nSpecialising in the teaching of acting, the RCSSD has educated the likes of Laurence Olivier, Vanessa Redgrave, and Judi Dench. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £21,982 \n16. Kingston University \nBased, as its name suggests, in Kingston upon Thames, the university is cheaper than some of its central London counterparts. However, students can still expect to spend almost £13,000 on top of their fees every year. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £22,058 \n15. Leeds Beckett University \nOne of just a handful of universities outside the capital on the list. Formerly known as Leeds Metropolitan University, Beckett is one of the UK's largest higher education centres. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \n14. University of Westminster ( Getty ) \nA university since 1992, the central London school is world renowned for its Communication and Media Research Institute, one of the top 40 communications schools in the world. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £22,810 \n13. London Metropolitan University \nDespite being frequently ranked as one of the UK's worst universities, London Metropolitan is one of its most expensive, thanks in part to its location close to the centre of the capital. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £23,000 \n12. Middlesex University \nSituated in north London, Middlesex University's cost is pushed up by being within the capital. It counts comedian Johnny Vegas as perhaps its best known alumnus. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £23,040 \n11. School of African and Oriental Studies \nSpecialising in languages like Arabic and Mandarin, as well as its eponymous African Studies and Oriental Studies courses, SOAS is in the heart of London's Bloomsbury, near fellow universities Kings College and University College London. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £23,996 \n10. Imperial College \nImperial frequently ranks as one of the UK's best universities, with science subjects coming in for particular praise. It has produced 15 Nobel Prize-winners. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £24,186 \n9. Royal Academy of Music \nTeaching, as you might expect, music, the Royal Academy of Music is world renowned, and has educated students including Elton John, opera singer Katherine Jenkins, and Annie Lennox. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £24,312 \n8. Oxford Brookes University \nThe less glamorous and famous cousin of Oxford University, Brookes is one of the country's most costly universities thanks to the expense of living in Oxford, which consistently ranks among the UK's most expensive cities. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £24,450 \n7. City University London \nCity specialises in its vocational degrees, like optometry and nursing, as well as being known worldwide for its journalism school. It is situated in the borough of Islington, close to the City of London. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \n6. University of Oxford ( Getty ) (Oli Scarff / Getty Images) \nPerpetually one of the top five universities in the world, Oxford is fiendishly difficult to get into, and incredibly expensive for students when they do. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £24,760 \n5. London School of Economics and Political Science \nAnother university in the heart of central London, the LSE is famous for the quality of its teaching and research, and 17% of all Nobel economics laureates have attended or taught at the university. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £25,546 \n4. University College London \nIn the Bloomsbury cluster of universities, UCL claims to have educated the \"fathers\" of each of India, Kenya and Mauritius, the founders of Ghana, modern Japan and Nigeria. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £25,664 \n3. University of the Arts London \nWith campuses and colleges across London, UAL is one of the top 5 universities in the world for art and design, it claims. It includes Central Saint Martins art school, Camberwell College of Arts, and Chelsea College of Art and Design. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \nTotal cost: £25,776 \n2. Royal College of Music \nDifferent to the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College is located in South Kensington, and counts Phantom of the Opera writer Andrew Lloyd Webber and composer Gustav Holst among its alumni. \nTuition fees: £9,250 \n1. Regent's University London Regent's University London \nFar and away the most expensive higher education experience in the UK comes from Regent's University London. That's largely because as a private school, it can charge tuition fees that are almost double those of public universities. \nTuition fees: £16,400", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:40:06.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
