Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain's body language in the closing stages of Arsenal's defeat by Bayern Munich pretty much summed up how all Gunners fans were feeling. \nThe 23-year-old let frustration get the better of him as he threw a mini tantrum at his own teammates for not closing down Bayern's players. \nOxlade-Chamberlain was attempting to win the ball back as Arturo Vidal and Philipp Lahm passed it between themselves and was visibly livid when he turned around to see that nobody else had followed suit. \nHe jumped in the air in frustration before barking angry remarks back at his colleagues. \nArsenal's Champions League hopes are virtually over for another year after they were humbled 5-1 in the first leg of their last-16 tie at the Allianz Arena.
