Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports \nThe Cleveland Browns haven’t given up hope of landing New England Patriots quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo in a trade this offseason. \nESPN’s Adam Schefter emphatically reported last week the Patriots would not deal Garoppolo , but that hasn’t deterred the Browns from trying , according to a report Tuesday from Cleveland.com’s Mary Kay Cabot. \nFrom Cabot: \n“Despite a report by ESPN that the Patriots won’t trade Jimmy Garoppolo, I’m told that nothing has changed and that teams — including the Browns — will still try to land him. \n“One source told me he believes it might take as much as a No. 1 this year and No. 1 next year — which I’m sure the Browns won’t be willing to do. \n“But if New England will accept their No. 12 overall pick and maybe another later selection, I think the Browns would strongly consider that. \n“They’d come away with their franchise player on defense and their franchise quarterback, and that would be a grand slam first round. They’d sell tickets, get their weary fanbase excited again and likely starting winning right away.” \nCabot went on to say she’d even trade the No. 1 overall pick for Garoppolo “without hesitation,” though she doubts the Browns share that mindset. \nCleveland currently owns the Nos. 1 and 12 selections in the 2017 NFL Draft, and it’s widely expected to use the former on Texas A&M edge rusher Myles Garrett, whose eye-popping performance at the NFL Scouting Combine all but cemented his status as this year’s top draft prospect. \nGarrett has the potential to become a Von Miller-esque quarterback wrecker, but he can’t do anything to help the Browns’ offense, which hasn’t enjoyed more than a few short spurts of reliable QB play since the franchise’s rebirth in 1999. And there’s no savior signal-caller worth taking first overall in this draft class. \nGaroppolo’s talent and (admittedly limited) NFL experience make him a desirable option for teams with question marks under center, but it’s not surprising the Patriots are hesitant to ship him out of town. \nThis article first appeared on NESN.com and was syndicated with permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:10:29.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
