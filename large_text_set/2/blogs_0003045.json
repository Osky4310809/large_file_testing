Ranieri needs to start ringing his “dilly-ding, dilly-dong” bell quickly after Leicester were booed off at half time and full time. \nRanieri has gone back to being the Tinkerman, making too many tactical changes when the Leicester boss just needs to be ruthless and dump some of his champions - or he will be out of a job. Claudio Ranieri's job could be on the line if he doesn't show some ruthlessness (Photo: REUTERS) Kasper Schmeichel tries to rally his side during Sunday's defeat (Photo: REUTERS) \nLeicester’s centre halves Robert Huth and Wes Morgan looked superhuman last season. But from being two dependable stalwarts, they now look like pub players. \nRiyad Mahrez need not have bothered taken a shower after the game, he put such little effort in. Leicester have bought badly and far too many are still dining out on last season, coasting after signing big fat contracts in the summer. Read More Leicester 0-3 Man United: Red Devils heap more misery on Premier League champions - 5 things we learned \nLeicester go to Swansea next Sunday for a do-or-die survival scrap and if they lose that then you begin to wonder how much time Ranieri has got. \nEven more pertinently, if Leicester do not produce some sort of reaction then Ranieri must wonder if he has lost the players because at the moment they do not look as if they are playing for him. Henrikh Mkhitaryan made the Foxes defence look silly on his way to scoring the opener (Photo: Manchester United via Getty) Schmeichel shows his disappointment as the Foxes season goes from bad to worse (Photo: REUTERS) \nLeicester have gone nearly nine hours without a Premier League goal, they have not scored this year and are in serious danger of becoming the first team since Manchester City in 1938 to be relegated as champions. \nThey never even went close to scoring let alone getting anything from this game. Their only comfort was that it was not a heavier defeat. It could easily have been. Read More Leicester 0-3 Manchester United player ratings: Who was YOUR man of the match at the King Power Stadium? \nMarcus Rashford twice went close even before United took the lead, Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel denying him with a brilliant save. Schmeichel is one of very few to emerge with any credit. \nUnited midfielder Juan Mata was very lucky referee Anthony Taylor did not send him off for an awful challenge on Jamie Vardy. Arsene Wenger got a four game touchline ban for pushing Taylor. But Taylor clearly thinks an X-rated over-the-top tackle is only worthy of a yellow card. Manchester United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores their second goal (Photo: REUTERS) \nIt was all too easy for United, highlighted by the first goal after 42 minutes. Long ball down the middle, Chris Smalling flicked it on, Huth got it all wrong, committed himself and left Mkhitaryan all alone to run clear before smashing a shot past Schmeichel. \nIt was so easy that it was embarrassing. And just 88 seconds later, United made it two as once again Leicester’s defence was ripped open. \nUnited full back Antonio Valencia’s low cross found Ibrahimovic and the United striker fired home his 20th goal of the season with a clinical low finish. Game over. \nThe third goal was almost as easy. Mkhitaryan and Mata linked up brilliantly on the right, they swapped passes again before Mata then beat Leicester’s sorry excuse for an offside trap and then fired home.

Mata was sent clean through, he had so much space that he looked round in bewilderment. But that’s just Leicester’s defending. Mata fluffed his lines and fired straight at Schmeichel. \nUnited were well worth their win, their unbeaten run stretched to 15 games and a top four places is easily within their sights when they play as well as this. \nFor Leicester, the warnings are all there. If they carry on like this then they will go down. Forget the title glory, being in the Champions League last 16, this embarrassment will tarnish last season, ruin the memory and turn them into laughing stocks.
