By Scott Mervis   \nBeloved punk bands Rancid and Dropkick Murphys will bring the co-headlining From Boston To Berkeley Tour to Stage AE on Aug. 2. \nEach night will culminate with the two Warped Tour vets, who last played here together in 2003, on stage for a joint encore. The Bouncing Souls and Jake Burns will open the show. \nTickets go on sale on sale at 10 a.m. Friday at www.ticketmaster.com, www.DropkickMurphys.com and www.RancidRancid.com . \n\"It's a long time coming with these two bands touring together,” said Rancid’s Lars Frederiksen. “There is so much history between both of us that it should make for a great tour. We look forward to seeing all of our friends and family out there.\" \nDropkick Murphys’ Ken Casey commented, \"This is a dream come true for Dropkick Murphys. Hopefully all the people coming to the shows will feel the same way. Rancid gave us our break -- Tim signing us to his label, Lars producing our early albums...so much history and great memories. Now, literally sharing the stage together every night. This tour is going to destroy all others this summer!!!!\" \nScott Mervis: smervis@post-gazette.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:57:10.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
