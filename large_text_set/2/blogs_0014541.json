It sounds like Young Thug has some new heat on the way for us. Over the weekend, the ATL icon took to his Instagram to share a preview of an upcoming song, and it sounds fire! Unfortunately, no information was revealed on the song, like when it’ll be dropping or what project it’ll be off of, but based on the comments in the post, it COULD be called “Everybody (AKA Don't You Look At Me),” but that’s an educated guess based on the lyrics. For what it’s worth, Thugger’s caption did read “wait over,” so who knows what that means…. maybe song title? or maybe that’s it dropping soon, either way it’s on the way and it sounds fire. While we wait for the record to drop, check out the lengthy preview (below) and let us know what you think!
