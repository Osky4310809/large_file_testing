The cleats are extremely dope, and I love that the Falcons’ superstar receiver chose to represent Atlanta with a tribute to the hottest rap group in the city. It’s also fitting because defenders would tell you that Jones is “Slippery” when he’s got the ball in the open field. \nThe close-up shots on the cleats show the incredible detail of the art, including Julio Jones in place of the Migos and “Super Bowl” written in graffiti instead of “NAWF,” as it is on the album cover. \nUnder Armour\nUnder Armour\n\nNot only do the cleats give a nod to the Migos’ new album, they also give a shout-out to Atlanta the TV show, starring Donald Glover with Atlanta written in the show’s title font on the front of the cleats. \nUnder Armour\nIt’s really unfortunate that Jones won’t be allowed to wear these cleats in the actual game without getting fined, but I hope he does and someone foots the bill because these are exceptional. If he does grace the Super Bowl field in these cleats for the game itself, I’d have to set the Falcons line at – 17.5 (same color T-shirt) .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:08:04.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
