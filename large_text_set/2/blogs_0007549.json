Becket Adams is just as confused as you and I are. \nFrom Washington Examiner : \nTur’s question is a bit all over the place, and it’s not exactly clear what she’s trying to say. She wonders aloud if Trump is “almost” giving himself “an excuse” by refusing to criticize Putin. \nShe then says in the next breath that there have been a “couple dozen suspicious deaths of journalists in Russia” since Putin assumed control in 2000. Trump is supposedly giving himself “an excuse” to do what, exactly? \nWhat is Tur saying? \nThat’s a good question. \nSure sounds like she is implying Trump would like to assassinate journalists and he’s jealous that Putin allegedly has done so. \nOne thing’s for sure, that’s not responsible journalism.
