Durant, Paul George and others were playing 2K17 when Burress, serving as the event’s host, walked up to Durant and couldn’t help but troll him by asking “if y’all lose this game, will you join their team next season?”\n. @hannibalburess to Kevin Durant –\n\"Durant…if y'all lose this game, will you join their team next season?\"\npic.twitter.com/eGH2lqyEZ9 \n— Def Pen Hoops (@DefPenHoops) February 18, 2017 \n\nDurant didn’t seem to find it as funny as Burress and the rest of us did, as he just kept on playing, but it was an amazing moment. Burress simply walked away knowing it was a perfectly executed joke and didn’t need any follow-up (also, Durant probably would’ve gotten mad if he’d pressed). I love how comfortable Burress is when making other people uncomfortable (it’s why he’s so great on the Eric Andre Show), and he just thrives in situations when other people feel incredibly awkward, like Durant here.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:38:37.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
