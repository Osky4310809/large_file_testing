(Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images) \nPITTSBURGH (93-7 The Fan) – Spare me. \nAfter all, this is just opinion. \nSo spare me the whole: “DEBATE OVER!” and “HE’S THE BEST EVER NOW!” and “IT’S FACT!” stuff that I have been reading and consuming since the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl and Tom Brady earned his fifth title. \nFor my liking, far too many people want to shout down at everyone and tell them how Tom Brady — even though this would be a statement of opinion and not fact — is the greatest quarterback in the history of the world. Period. End of Story. \nYeah, they throw in that “period” for added emphasis, I guess. They say “end of story” as if the discussion needs to end, I guess. \nWell, I got some news for you: Such a thought is merely opinion; so stop trying to pass it off as fact. There really isn’t a right or wrong answer. If you want to construct an argument for Joe Montana or Terry Bradshaw or a few other men, I can and will listen to it. \nIt isn’t a crazy notion to think someone else might still be the greatest quarterback who ever lived. \nGot it? You stating Brady is the GOAT is opinion, so come off your “you-don’t-know-what-you-are-talking-about” shtick when I don’t necessarily agree with you. \nBut there’s really much more to it in Brady’s instance. \nYou see, I will never be able to quantify the full gravity of how much the man benefitted from his franchise’s cheating ways. \nDid Tom Brady complete one more pass in his life because his franchise cheated? \nDid Tom Brady complete zero passes for zero yards as a result of either him or his franchise cheating? \nDid Brady gain a great advantage at times in his career (Games? Months? Seasons?) as a result of some things not being done above board and he and his offense directly benefitting? \nDid he win an AFC Championship Game on a frozen field where two rivers form to make a third because he illegally obtained information? Some insist that’s the case. \nIt is all so cloudy and murky; all so leaden and foggy that it forces me to question every single yard this man accumulated throughout his career. Quite simply, because I don’t know how many were amassed legally or illegally, in my estimation it is more than fair to wonder just how fair Tom Brady’s accomplishments have been. \nThat’s why, for me at least, he will never be considered the greatest. Instead, he should be considered a man with a gargantuan amount of talent who led his team to much acclaim but who also should be made to have an asterisk next to everything. \nThere is — again for me — simply too much doubt. \nI am going to wonder just how deep the cheating went. \nForever. \nI am going to wonder just how much Tom Brady accomplished because of proprietary information he was made privy to that was gathered through means deemed illegal by the NFL or by using equipment he manipulated. \nForever. \nI am going to wonder how much Spygate and Deflategate gave Bill Belichick unfair advantages — particularly the former and particularly early in his Patriots’ career – over opponents. \nForever. \nAfter all, the fines were real. \nThe docked draft picks were real. \nTom Brady’s suspension — that was real. \nAll that stuff happened in real life. It wasn’t fabricated. \nSo you can go ahead and keep crowning Tom Brady the greatest who ever lived. \nYour opinion, your right. Knock yourself out and call him the GOAT and all that stuff. \nMe? I’m perfectly fine questioning the validity of his career because the fact — not opinion — is that his franchise cheated while he was the quarterback. \nColin Dunlap is a featured columnist at CBSPittsburgh.com.
