Down and out? Barton's Clarets career is in doubt (Photo: Getty) \nBurnley believe that the FA will come down hard on a player who has courted controversy throughout his career. \nCrystal Palace and England winger Andros Townsend was handed a four match ban, three of which were suspended, after being found guilty of flouting betting regulations while at Spurs, but in November Frome Town manager Nick Bunyard was suspended for three years on betting charges. \nA substantial ban would almost certainly mean Burnley having to forget any thoughts of offering Barton a new deal placing his future in serious doubt. \nBurnley boss Sean Dyche came to Barton’s rescue offering the player a route back to football after a massive fall out with Rangers after just eight games with the Scottish giants.
