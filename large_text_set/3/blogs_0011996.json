As her pal Whitney Carter despairs at her behaviour, Lauren might be set to throw away everything – but will it work out for her or might she discover that the grass isn’t necessarily greener? \nAs Lauren confides once more in Whitney about her strained relationship with Steven, Whitney gives her advice but whether it hits home remains to be seen. When Lauren is later opening up to Jane about love and relationships, she suddenly panics and rushes over to the Vic as she has left her phone there. But why is she so panicked about her phone getting into someone else’s hands?\n(Picture: BBC) Might she be cheating on Steven? In the wake of Lauren’s frantic reaction, Whitney urges her mate to fight for her relationship with Steven – but it could already be too late.\nLater, Lauren and Whitney plan a night out on the town and while Whitney is initially excited to be having some girl time with her friend, it soon dawns on her why they have really gone out and ended up in the place where they are drinking.\n(Picture: BBC) Annoyed, Whitney has some harsh words for Lauren and forces her to think about what she really wants – but is that Steven or is her eye now firmly elsewhere?\nWith Lauren getting sick of spending nights in with the Beales, what she does next and whether there might be someone else in her life is under wraps.\n(Picture: BBC) With Whitney trying to get through to Lauren, can things with Steven be salvaged?\n(Picture: BBC) Or are he and Lauren heading for the rocks?\nOne to watch: Thursday 23rd March at 7:30pm on BBC One.
