They’re immediately recognizable: crimped waves, oversized scrunchies, impractical hair clips in the shape of butterflies or daisies. And remember the good ol’ Topsy Tail hair tool that inverted your half-up hairdo into a cool twist? No? Maybe it was just my mom that used that thing on me all the time. I thought it was ~so~ cool.\nAnyway, in the modern days of the lob, the ombre, and the seemingly effortless (but not actually effortless) beachy wave, it can be fun to reminisce on the wild hair days of the nineties. Without further ado, here are our favorite nineties hair accessories from the days of yore.\n1. Scrunchies George De Sota / Getty Images Personally, DJ Tanner from Full House was my scrunchie trend guru, but the scrunchie was everywhere at the time.\n2. Fluffy Things www.etsy.com/listing/507216859/unique-orange-hair-clip-fuzzy-hair-clip Did fluffy things like these make sense? No, but Cher from Clueless wore fluffy things in her hair, so we wore fluffy things in our hair.\n3. Colored Metal Clips www.etsy.com/listing/502912661/black-glitter-moon-star-decorated-hair Why wear a plain metal clip when you can wear a metal clip with stars and the moon on them??\n4. Big Claw Clips NBC / Getty Images Looking back on it, we don’t really know why we wanted our hair to look like a floppy tarantula piled at the back of our head, but hey, it was definitely a thing.\n5. Poofy Clips www.etsy.com/listing/293819903/vtg-90s-hair-bow-clip-rainbow-colored Pretty sure that the only requirement for whether or not a hair accessory was cool in the nineties was if it had a least two neon colors.\n\n6. Daisy Clips www.etsy.com/listing/274562510/vintage-big-neon-90s-flower-hair-clips If you didn’t have neon-colored daisy clips in the nineties, were you even a nineties kid?\n7. Bedazzled Clips Jeff Kravitz / Getty Images If your clips didn’t have color, then they sure as heck better have had bling.\n8. Butterfly Clips www.etsy.com/listing/228483690/90s-babygrrl-butterfly-clips Now these were (and still our) perhaps our most beloved nineties hair trend. Do we still have these somewhere in the back of one of our bathroom drawers? We’ll admit it if you do.\n9. Bandanas Michel Linssen / Getty Images Bandanas as crop tops, bandanas as hair accessories, bandanas bandanas bandanas.\n10. Bobble Hair Ties www.etsy.com No, plain black hair ties were not acceptable in the nineties. If it didn’t shimmer or have some form of molded plastic, it wasn’t trendy.\n11. Jeweled Headbands ABC Photo Archives / Getty Images Long live the bedazzled headband, forever (in our nineties hearts) may it reign.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:53:40.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
