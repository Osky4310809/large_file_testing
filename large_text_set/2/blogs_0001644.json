Now, with a makeover of black and purple paint, theatrical lighting and a wrestling ring, the barn hosts weeknight practices and occasional Friday night performances that draw crowds of up to 500 people.\nRelated Articles January 31, 2017 Business Q&A: Belong Designs, Denver January 31, 2017 Aurora Crime Blotter: Burglary spree in the snow January 31, 2017 Adams County Crime Blotter: Car vandal claims he was stretching January 31, 2017 Douglas County residents to get first taste of fun at Rueter-Hess Reservoir this summer January 31, 2017 Arvada Crime Blotter: Burglar turns out to be a drunk man in the wrong house Pro wrestlers dress in costume, assume characters and learn skilled moves they bring to the ring in dramatic fights with body slams, kicks and punches — without major injury.

You actually have to work together and that’s what I love about it — just working together and putting on a show for the audience.”\nCole’s girlfriend Brittney Balestra-Villani was there, too. She said she was skeptical at first, but gave wrestling a shot after sitting on the sidelines at practices. Now, she has set a goal to perform at a show in July.\n“It was just a lot more fun than I expected it to be,” Balestra-Villani said.\nDamien Richard is living out his love of wrestling.\n“It’s not just going in there and doing moves to each other,” he said. “Everything matters and everything has to mesh.”\nLawson, whose boyfriend teaches for the academy, never thought she would be a fan of pro wrestling. But after her first show, she said was hooked.\n“It’s a story and it’s a continuing story,” she said. “When you become a fan you stay a fan for a long time.”\nRocky Mountain Pro wrestling performs next at 6 p.m. Feb. 11 in the Livestock Arena at Jeffco Fairgrounds, 15200 W. 6th Ave. They also perform regularly at Rackhouse Pub, 22785 Blake St., Denver.
