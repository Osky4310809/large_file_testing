In fact, a closer look at Mignolet's record over the years suggests that, if he could simply face a few more spot-kicks he would get a LOT more love from the Anfield faithful. \nIncredibly, Mignolet has now saved SEVEN penalties since the start of hte 2011/12 season - and that is considerably more than any other Premier League keeper in that time: Premier League penalty saves since 2011/12 So, is Mignolet a butter-fingered, flaky-wristed liberty in the Liverpool goal? Or is he a spot-kick saving super stopper?
