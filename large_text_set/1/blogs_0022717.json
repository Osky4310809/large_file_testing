Yelling just jacks people up. It doesn’t communicate any kind of humanity or any kind of story that would open another person’s mind.” At the march, Madonna yelled “f - - k you” and “suck a d - - k” while singing one of her songs.\nLauper praised Scarlett Johansson’s speech as “clear and eloquent.”\nMeanwhile, comic Jackie Mason weighed in on the Material Girl’s address by telling Aaron Klein’s Sunday AM 970 show “The Answer,” “I don’t know why anybody even quotes Madonna . . . Nobody cares about anything she says because, let’s be honest about it — when she sings, she sings for a hundred million people. When she talks, everybody disappears.”\nHe also called her — in what might be the worst borscht-belt insult — a “deranged yenta.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T05:32:48.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
