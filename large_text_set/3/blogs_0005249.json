She was the opposite. She threatened and humiliated us,\" she said in her interview.\nShe is referring to Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey , according to the Mirror. \nWilley has been quoted saying that Hillary is complicit in her husband's attacks by helping silence his victims.\n\"Hillary Clinton's been calling me a bimbo for 19 years, as well as Paula [Jones] and Juanita [Broaddrick] and Gennifer,\" Willey said.\nBroaddrick said that Girls Inc. \"should be ashamed of their actions\" in giving Clinton this award, and called the former First Lady an enabler of sexual abuse crimes.\n\"By giving this award to Hillary Clinton, they are implying enablers of sexual abuse crimes should not be held accountable,\" she said.\nClinton told her audience while accepting the award about the \"setbacks\" life has handed her.\n\"Now, the truth is, life hands all of us setbacks,\" Clinton said, smirking as many in the audience of the Girls Inc. event laughed. \"Now, we know that.
