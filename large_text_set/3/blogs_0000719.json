Download Now Zoho Vault Enterprise Terms and conditions \nZoho Vault is an online password management software that lets individuals and businesses securely store, share and manage passwords and other sensitive data and access them from anywhere. \nIndividuals and organizations are drowning in a sea of passwords - both personal and business - because passwords are still the dominant form of user authentication. To stay afloat, users adopt shortcuts and poor password practices. They store passwords in spreadsheets, text files and other volatile sources. They share them insecurely, without protection. And they reuse passwords that are usually weak and easy to remember. Zoho Vault solves these password problems with an online password manager that's easy to use yet highly secure. \nImportant! The program is Cloud-based. You don`t need to install it on your PC. This is a 5-user multi-device 1-year license and allows Commercial use, provides free upgrades and support. The offer can't be used by existing users of Zoho Vault! The developer leaves up to 4 days for your account activation, but most likely it will be performed the same day. While you wait, you can continue to use Zoho Vault with full functionality. Please download our standard zip archive with the registration instruction! System Requirements: \nWindows XP/ Vista/ 7/ 8/ 8.1/ 10 (x32/x64), Mac OS X, Linux, Android, iOS, and any operating system that supports a modern web browser.
