The march is scheduled for 10 a.m. till 1 p.m. \nTen other marches across the country will also feature the inflatable rooster, including San Francisco who has already received their rooster. \nThe balloon was hatched in a flock in China, where Trump roosters were big attractions in shopping malls celebrating the Chinese New Year of the Rooster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:49:25.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
