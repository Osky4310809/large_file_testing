Although the director didn’t continue with the mutant franchise, he did help create a whole new one by returning to a familiar source: writer Mark Millar. The result was Kingsman: The Secret Service , a surprise hit owing to its fun tone, over-the-top violence, and the charm brought by Taron Egerton in the lead role of Gary ‘Eggsy’ Unwin.\nThe film’s box office success led to an inevitable sequel in Kingsman: The Golden Circle , set to arrive in the fall of 2017 . The sequel sees Vaughn and Egerton both return, alongside surprise returning characters and several high-profile additions. While much of the plot is still unknown, Egerton recently revealed some details about the film’s tone, and also teased the potential for a third film.\nWhile speaking with Egerton about Sing , Den of Geek inquired as to the direction Kingsman 2 will take. In his response, Egerton discussed what he sees as a relevant political theme:\n“I think it very much is political. I think I can say there’s a ‘presidential’ thread that runs through the new film. I think that, each time, whenever there’s a new global threat that arises in the world of Kingsman , it will be something that may have genuine relevance. In the first one, I guess we could say it’s over population, and in this one, it’s a similarly pertinent global theme. But I think you’re right. It’s a warped, distorted presentation of politics, but I think the themes are definitely there.”\nThe normal trend for sequels it to go bigger, which is in keeping with what Egerton has said Kingsman 2 aims to do. But the actor also seemed keen on the idea of creating a larger franchise, and doing a “continuing series” of Kingsman films.\n“Matthew is a very much ‘Don’t count the chickens before they’ve hatched’ kind of guy, but he also has a real sense of Kingsman being his baby and he won’t jeopardise it with a crap idea. So it depends what occurs, and whether it feels right to him, but I don’t think for a second that either he or myself, the lovely people at Fox and whoever else is interested in Kingsman , wouldn’t completely love it if this is a continuing series.”\nAfter the success of the first film, it would be hard to imagine The Golden Circle not being as big a hit as its predecessor. The expanded cast, which includes the likes of Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, and Julianne Moore will likely only help the film’s financial prospects, and the prospects of there being a larger Kingsman franchise in the future.\nSource: Den of Geek", "external_links": ["http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Harry-Kingsman.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/taron-egerton/46748/taron-egerton-interview-sing-kingsman-2-kingsman-3", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Harry-Kingsman.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1400&h=700&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Harry-Kingsman.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Harry-Kingsman.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Harry-Kingsman.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Harry-Kingsman.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Harry-Kingsman.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Harry-Kingsman.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-26T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T02:37:53.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
