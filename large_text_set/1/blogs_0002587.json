We finally have some, and they start with a couple of new characters. One is supportive, and the other isn't so much.\n\nLet's start with our antagonist, who appears first in the trailer. His name is Jackson Storm, and in an Entertainment Weekly article on the movie, director Brian Fee explained that he's the film's main antagonist. He's voiced by Armie Hammer, and is a young, high-tech car that is out to take the racing world for himself. He also happens to be the car in the first trailer that overtook McQueen on that fateful race. We noticed he had a bit of an electric whine in that first trailer, and there's a hint of it in this trailer, but generally covered up by internal combustion noises. The Entertainment Weekly article has an image that says he has an 850 horsepower V8. We suppose we'll have to wait to find out whether it's a hybrid V8.\n\nThe second new character is named Cruz Ramirez, and is voiced by Cristela Alonzo. Fee tells Entertainment Weekly that she's a very optimistic and supportive character, and she was a fan of McQueen. These are all good traits for her role in the film. She's Lightning McQueen's trainer in the movie.\n\nSpeaking of McQueen, he shows up in this trailer as well. He's still his normal self as far as we can tell from the video. He also has ditched the rear wing and side skirts he had in Cars 2 in favor of more traditional rear spoiler and plain body work. However, as Fee explains to Entertainment Weekly , he's older, and is now faced with the question of whether he can and should continue racing. Based on this information, it sounds like our predictions on the film weren't terribly far off. Although it'll probably be less Six-Million-Dollar Man and a little more Rocky .\n\nFor more information, we recommend checking out the Entertainment Weekly story . There are more photos and details on the movie. The movie itself will be in theaters on June 16th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:17:34.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
