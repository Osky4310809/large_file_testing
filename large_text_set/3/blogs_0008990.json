Photo: ESTI Inc. \nEver wish you could have the best of both iOS and Android on one smartphone? A new Kickstarter is trying to make that dream a reality with a crazy case that turns the iPhone 7 Plus into an Android smartphone. \nSimply called “Eye”, the case features a 5-inch AMOLED display with an SD card slot and two SIM trays. Eye runs Android 7.1 Nougat OS and taps into the iPhone’s rear camera for high-quality selfies. \nIt also packs some features the iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t have. Like a 2800mAh battery that can be charged wirelessly and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The NFC chip can be for things other than Apple Pay and it also sports an infrared blaster and receiver. \nThe Eye Kickstarter has nearly reached its funding goal of $95,000. Pledges of $119 or more will get you one of the first units. There are options for the iPhone 6s, 6s Plus, 7 and 7 Plus. \nShipping estimates are currently pegged for August 2017, but for a product this complex, I wouldn’t get my hopes up on that happening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:29:29.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
