Ashok Selvam A new taqueria is opening on Wednesday near DePaul’s Lincoln Park campus from the owners of Millie’s Supper Club with food from the Mexican ex-Dinner Lab chef behind the upcoming Anomar. The fast-casual spot is called Holy Taco! , opening at 953 W. Webster Ave. Millie’s and Prost! owner Brian Reynolds is collaborating with Daniel Espinoza, serving up Mexico City-style tacos with house-made tortillas. Espinoza said he’s responsible for the recipes and credited his mother for her influence. They’re focusing on properly-marinated meat and high-quality produce, not the typical assembly line fare. Holy Taco! will feature six proteins, including a proper al pastor prepared with a trompo: “I’d shoot myself if I wasn’t,” Espinoza joked. Holy Taco’s! al pastor taco. Daniel Espinoza Other options are carne asada, carnitas, beef barbacoa, chorizo and chicken tinga. Besides tacos, they’ll also serve sincronizadas, which are often mistaken for a quesadilla. For those unfamiliar, it’s a lighter quesadilla-like dish often filled with meats and other ingredients; a stark contrast to those giant, bloated burritos many Americans are used to eating. Holy Taco! will also have vegetarian and gluten-free options. Tacos are a radical departure from Reynolds’ two other restaurants. Millie’s near DePaul celebrates Wisconsin supper club culture, while Prost!, down the street on Lincoln Avenue, is a German-inspired beer bar. So what does this mean for Anomar, Espinoza’s fine-dining idea for a Mexican restaurant? The restaurant has hit a few snags, but Espinoza is scouting locations and committed to the project. He’s still throwing pop-ups across the city , so folks can grab a preview of what the former Dinner Lab chef has planned if they pay attention to Anomar’s social media accounts. Espinoza will continue to contribute to Holy Taco! as he continues his dream of becoming a Michelin-starred chef. As far as the name goes? “Holy Taco!” isn’t exactly unique , but just remember that exclamation mark. Holy Taco!, 953 W. Webster Ave., phone number and business hours not posted yet. 953 W.
