Image caption The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, where Andrewes became chairman, was among those he hoodwinked \nHis total earnings from the health bodies between 2005-16 was £1,072,076. \nAmong the fake claims he called himself \"Dr\", despite him not having a PHD. \nAndrewes also falsely claimed degrees from Edinburgh, Plymouth and Bristol universities, although he did have a Higher Education Certificate in Social Work. \nHe had actually spent most of his career as a probation officer, customs officer or youth worker. \nChairman of St Margaret's Hospice, Michael Clark, who appointed Andrewes, said the hospice made \"significant progress\" under his leadership and he had \"no doubts about his ability to do the job\". \nBut he would not have employed Andrewes if he had known about the fake qualifications. \nCameron Brown, prosecuting, told the court that Andrewes' employment was a mixed bag with a range of performance, and he was \"not actively doing damage\". \nBut he said the grounds for prosecution were \"not his performance but the fact he was there\".
