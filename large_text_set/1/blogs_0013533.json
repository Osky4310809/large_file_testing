Making me a grandfather again! Wishing you all the love and happiness a father could wish a daughter.” \nHis message, posted on his official website, came after Janet’s sister LaToya, 60, tweeted : \"How exciting! @JanetJackson, Jan and Wissam just gave birth to a beautiful baby boy!!!

She feels like this is one of the best things ever to happen to her, she says.” \nJanet married Qatari businessman Wissam in 2012. \nInstead of having a lavish wedding, the couple said they tied the knot in a \"quiet, private, beautiful\" ceremony and donated money to children’s charities close to their hearts.
