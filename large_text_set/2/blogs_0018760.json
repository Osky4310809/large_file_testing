The footage was provided to him, O’Keefe said, by people inside the network. \nAfter the radio interview was recorded, HuffPost asked if O’Keefe would be releasing footage from multiple newsrooms or just one. “One corporation, multiple newsrooms,” he said. \nO’Keefe wouldn’t divulge which particular network would be hit, but said it was one President Donald Trump has spent much time talking about recently. “It’s the one he’s always targeting,” O’Keefe said. \nThat would seem to suggest CNN. Trump has been on a tear against the network since it revealed the existence of an allegedly embarrassing dossier that intelligence agencies were investigating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:28:06.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
