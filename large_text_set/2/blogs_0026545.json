In addition, Samsung has launched a new initiative called “I&G (Infill & Growth) Project”, which will assist the new telco in improving the current 4G network’s capacity and coverage across the country. \nSamsung and Reliance Jio will focus on improving indoor and outdoor coverage. This will be done by utilising spectrum in the 850, 1800 and 2300MHz bands, which will enable seamless indoor and outdoor coverage in dense urban areas. Reliance Jio Senior VP Tareq Amin said that the goal of the partnership was to see how to improve the capacity. \nSamsung said that it will extend Jio’s coverage in rural areas by expanding its reach to over 90 percent of the country’s population. The former already provides LTE core, base stations and solutions required for VoLTE services and massive deployment services for establishing a countrywide network for Jio. \nJio said that its network is all IP ready, and it is ready to embrace and adopt 5G. Samsung also showcased a couple of 5G-ready devices like home routers, 5G radio base stations and modem chipsets at the event. They are set to be launched in India sometime in the future.
