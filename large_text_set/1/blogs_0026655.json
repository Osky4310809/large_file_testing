Jesse C. Montes de Oca, 31, was standing in a backyard in the 3500 block of West 38th Place when someone in a silver SUV fired shots, according to Chicago Police and the Cook County medical examiner’s office. He suffered a gunshot wound to the back and was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:30 p.m. He lived in Brighton Park. \nAbout 1:40 a.m. Saturday, Kentrell Thompson, 25, was sitting in a vehicle at a gas station in the 1200 block of North Halsted in the Goose Island neighborhood on the Near North Side when someone fired several shots at the vehicle, authorities said. Thompson suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene. He lived in the Humboldt Park neighborhood. \nAnother killing happened about 7:45 p.m. Friday in the West Pullman neighborhood on the Far South Side. Officers responded to a call of shots fired in the 400 block of West 129th Place and found 34-year-old Jeffery Demetrius Brown with gunshot wounds to the head and thigh, authorities said. Brown, who lived on the same block, was taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead at 8:27 p.m. \nThe sheriff’s deputy was among three people wounded when gunfire erupted outside a Gold Coast bar where he was working security while off-duty about 3:30 a.m. Saturday near State and Division, authorities said. \nA 39-year-old man grazed in the head was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital along with a 33-year-old man shot in the leg; and a 30-year-old man shot in the back was taken to Illinois Masonic Medical Center. Fire officials said they all were in serious condition, but police said they had been stabilized by mid-morning. Clifton Banks, 36, faces two felony counts of attempted first-degree murder in connection with the shooting. \nThe weekend’s latest nonfatal shooting wounded a 16-year-old boy about 6:50 p.m. Sunday in the Hermosa neighborhood on the Northwest Side. He was walking in the 1900 block of North Pulaski when he heard gunfire and realized he’d been shot in the right foot, police said. He took himself to Saints Mary Mary and Elizabeth Medical Center, where he was listed in good condition. \nAt least 20 more people were wounded in other Chicago shootings between Friday afternoon and Monday morning. \nLast weekend, 53 people were shot in Chicago, six of them fatally. More than 285 people have been shot in the city during the first month of the year, and at least 49 have died. \n(Source: Sun-Times Media Wire © Chicago Sun-Times 2017. All Rights Reserved.
