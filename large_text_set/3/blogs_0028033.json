As ever, Postecoglou remains defiant. \n“For 20 years in coaching what I’ve been consistent in producing is teams that win things,” he said. \n“I do it in a certain way. It does get scary. I understand that. \n“I’m glad people care and I’m glad people are talking about it. I’m glad people are nervous and anxious and I’m glad they’re passionate. \n“I’ll cop it a bit but we’ll see it through. (The pressure) doesn’t faze me.” \nAgainst UAE, Australia will be without playmakers Tom Rogic and Aaron Mooy due to injury and suspension. \nJames Troisi, who impressed in a 10-minute cameo against Iraq, could start in Mooy’s place, with Nathan Burns another option. \nTomi Juric appears likely to maintain his position leading the line, despite clamour for veteran Tim Cahill to return to the fore. \nRegular centre-back Trent Sainsbury is favoured to come into defence, with Brad Smith another possible starter. \nWhatever the starting line-up, captain Mile Jedinak said the most important thing was to regain the ascendancy in physical contests after being out-muscled against Iraq. \n“It didn’t look the best and we don’t like that,” he said. \n“It happened. We allowed them too much time. \n“I was disappointed as much as anybody after that. \n“But you’ve got to realise what’s at stake. These countries don’t always get opportunities to qualify for World Cups.” Postecoglou said he wanted to win and win in style against the Emirati, continuing his campaign to turn Australia into a force to be reckoned with. “We all want to qualify but we’re determined on continuing this path to be a certain type of team. All of us are behind it. The players embrace it,” he said. “It was always going to come down to these last few games, especially at home. “It’s still in our hands. We don’t deviate or cower now just because people are anxious about qualifying. \n“We’re not doing this so we don’t qualify. We’re doing it so we qualify and hopefully make an impact.” \nWatch the Socceroos host United Arab Emirates on Tuesday on Fox Sports 505 HD.
