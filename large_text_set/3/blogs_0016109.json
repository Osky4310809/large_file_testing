He is bemoaning how the Firefox browser is warning that the page isn't suitable for the transmission of passwords.\n\"Your notice of insecure password and/or log-in automatically appearing on the log-in for my website, Oil and Gas International, is not wanted and was put there without our permission,\" a person with the user name dgeorge wrote here . \"Please remove it immediately. We have our own security system, and it has never been breached in more than 15 years. Your notice is causing concern by our subscribers and is detrimental to our business.\"\nFurther Reading Firefox, Chrome start calling HTTP connections insecure As a member of the Mozilla developer team promptly pointed out, both Firefox and Chrome routinely issue warnings whenever users encounter a log-in page that's not protected by HTTPS encryption. The warnings became standard earlier this year .\nThat same user wrote:\nWhen your site requests a user's password over HTTP, the transmission of these passwords is done in the clear. As such, anybody listening on the network would be able to record those passwords. This puts not just users at risk when using your site, but also puts them at risk on any other website that they might share a password with yours.\nOne can only imagine such exchanges between uninformed website operators and browser makers becoming a regular occurrence since the warnings made their debut a couple months ago. This exchange is notable for the confidence dgeorge has in the unspecified \"security system\" of the website and the assertion the site has never been breached in more than 15 years. Frequently, there's no way to detect the type of attack Firefox and Chrome are trying to prevent with these warnings.\nThe complaint appears to involve this HTTP-based login page for oilandgasinternational.com. When viewed on Firefox, the following words are displayed immediately below both the user name and password fields: \"This connection is not secure. Logins entered here could be compromised.\" It then offers a link to additional information. Chrome, meanwhile, displays the words \"not secure\" in front of the login URL. Clicking on the warning brings up a more detailed warning.\nArs has emailed user dgeorge, who is listed on the site's contacts page, and asked them for comment. Dgeorge didn't respond as this post was going live.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:35:11.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
