Spent time with Chris Foy and Trevor Massey on a referee course for @SkySportsNewsHQ which will be shown next few days. Real eye opener. pic.twitter.com/Kgdp8AJweP \n— Danny Higginbotham (@Higginbotham05) March 22, 2017 \nAt first, I just couldn’t get in the right areas. I was awful. \nKeep up to date with ALL the latest football news, gossip and rumours \nBut, to be fair, I was trying my hand at refereeing — not actually kicking the ball around. \nAnd, I must say, I have a new-found respect for the men in the middle after my efforts. \nIt was a real eye-opener. \nI was with former whistle-blower Chris Foy and his linesman Trevor Massey, who now train referees. \nWe were part of a piece for Sky highlighting the great work done by officials up and down the country every weekend. \nNow, I was never one to get in the ref’s face when I was playing. Sky Sports Danny Higginbotham tried his hand at refereeing for a day Sky Sports 5 Danny Higginbotham admitted he found it difficult as a referee \nI wasn’t a huge complainer. I respected referees — but not as much as I respect them now. \nTaking charge of a small-sided college game, the interesting thing was I kept taking up positions as if I was playing — finding space or opening my body up as if to receive a pass. \nBut I should have been making sure I could see the bigger picture. \nIf a team is attacking, I shouldn’t have been finding myself in the middle of the action. \nI should have been backing up play to get the best view. \nI eventually got the hang of it, and it is all about positioning. It then makes the decision-making so much easier. \nIf I do ever want a career as a ref — which I hope is unlikely — I have a couple of other areas to work on. \nIn my post-match debrief with Chris, I was told that I kept giving marginal calls against attackers! Weekend Round-Up : Watch the best action from the Premier League Reuters Jamie Vardy was controversially sent off against Stoke \nApparently, a lot of the play-ons or fouls favoured the men at the back. \nThat may not be a surprise given that I was a fully paid-up member of the defenders’ union in my playing days. But, honestly, it was subconscious. \nAnd the other area of my refereeing that needs cutting out was my running commentary. \nI kept shouting: ‘Great save, keeper’, or ‘good tackle, mate’ or ‘great finish’. \nThat’s, of course, the chat you would use as a player — but it doesn’t look good for the ref to be complimenting a player! \nThe opposition would soon be saying: ‘What are you on about? Do you support them or something?’ \nChris told me at half-time to keep a lid on it. Maybe I should keep the whistle in my mouth to stop me talking! \nBut when I was playing I always wanted to keep the refs onside, to have some banter with them. And it was good if they could give some back. PA:Press Association 5 Zlatan Ibrahimovic was given a restrosepctive ban for his elbow on Tyrone Mings \nEarly in my career I found that easy. I have even traded friendly insults with them in the middle of a match. \nOne Premier League ref was quick to point out the size of my ears in one match, which I have mentioned before on these pages. \nI found towards the end of my career that dried up. But I found a level of camaraderie really helped me when I was out in the middle. \nI consciously tried to break the ice, by using first names, having a bit of banter. I think that helps enormously. \nSome people think it can look too friendly, but as long as the ref does it for all players and not just the ‘star’ names, it’s fine. most read in sport REAL PAIGE-TURNEr WWE leaked sex tape saga hots up as MORE raunchy videos and pics of ex-champ Paige are shared online Not good enough Antonio Conte has sensationally rejected the chance to sign Neymar in a £155m deal from Barcelona X-RATED SHOCKER Paige sex tape bombshell as fans express outrage at 'sex act over WWE championship belt' leg-break horror Seamus Coleman set for surgery on potential career-threatening injury after his leg is snapped in half by Neil Taylor's wild tackle TV TIMES What TV channel is England vs Lithuania on, what time is kick-off and what is the latest team news? 'If it happens, it happens' Floyd Mayweather responds to Conor McGregor's claims that he would knock him out \nAnyway, I had eight people watching me referee and I was taking charge of some college kids in a match with nothing riding on it. \nRefereeing a cup final with 80,000 people watching would be a different ball game altogether. \nAnd that’s why I think we should be a little more hesitant before criticising referees. \nI’m not a fan of more technology — just more understanding. \nIf we (viewers, pundits, journalists) need three replays of a decision before deciding if the ref is right or wrong, we should hold off from slamming him. \nYes, there are some blatant errors that referees need to be called out on, but a lot are subjective, or depend on the angle or what have you. Reuters Sergio Aguero was dismissed against Chelsea after a mass brawl \nLike Jamie Vardy’s sending-off earlier in the season against Stoke. \nI watched it three times from three different angles and reached three different conclusions. \nOne of the problems is that there are so many rules — and that so many of them are open to interpretation. \nIf you sat ten refs down they would not all come to the same conclusion over one incident. \nThat’s why I’m against more technology. \nIt’s been brilliant for goalline decisions but leave the game alone. \nAnd leave the ref alone, too.
