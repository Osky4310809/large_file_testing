Hashmot is hoping the surgery will provide him with the opportunity to reintegrate back into his community (Photo: Barcroft Media) The attack left him horrifically disfigured (Photo: Barcroft Media) Read More Massive extinct Caspian tigers to be 'brought back to life' half a century after hunters wiped them out \nHe hopes medics will be able to repair as much of his face as possible - helping him re-integrate into society. \nHasmot also hopes the surgery will give relief to his three daughters, who he fears could never find love due to the stigma his injuries carry in the community. \nA British tourist had a narrow escape from a lion after patting the animal on the bottom while posing for photos in a Thailand zoo.
