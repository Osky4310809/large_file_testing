JUST WATCHED Can Trump make peace in the Middle East? 01:31 Story highlights Aaron David Miller: It's hard to see compelling US interests that would warrant the change It will undermine US credibility as an effective broker in negotiations with Palestinians and key Arab states, he writes Aaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and author of \"The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President.\" Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Follow him @aarondmiller2 . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) Sean Spicer's cautious comments at the White House press briefing on moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem suggest that the incoming Trump administration is taking its time considering whether to make good on the President's campaign promise. And it's just as well. For an administration that aspires to an America First foreign policy, moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem puts America's interests last, not at the head of the line. Whatever the political benefits of moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, it's hard to see the compelling US national interests that would warrant the change and outweigh the risks of doing so. Aaron David Miller Two of the last three Presidents-elect promised to move the embassy ; but upon election reconsidered and took advantage of the national security waiver provided in the congressionally mandated 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which compelled the Clinton administration to move the embassy. President Obama did not make such a campaign commitment; but took advantage of the waiver too. Rarely, though, has an incoming administration seemed so serious about acting on its campaign pledge. Trump has made the pledge repeatedly. He has nominated an ambassador who already has personally endorsed the move -- and written into the statement announcing his appointment that he was looking forward to representing the US from a Jerusalem embassy. Read More Indeed, having worked the Middle East in both Republican and Democratic administrations, it's never seemed more apparent that the incoming administration wants to initiate the move. The issue appears to be not whether, but when and how. Why moving the US embassy to Jerusalem is controversial The Trump administration's motives for raising the controversial Jerusalem issue now are varied. It would show that Trump is serious about his campaign promises; it would demonstrate a sharp break with the tensions that marked the previous administration's relations with Israel; and it would show support for a close US ally. Finally, the incoming administration is eager to correct a legitimate anomaly -- Israel is one of the few countries in the world in which the US doesn't maintain its embassy in the preferred capital of the host country where the parliament, Supreme Court and seats of government are located. As relevant as these political considerations may be, none of them outweigh the downsides of the move from a national security or foreign policy perspective. There are many ways to reassure the Israelis of US support without undertaking a unilateral change in US policy that accrues little real benefit to America.
