He welcomes the gloomy outlook from the rest of the league. \n“I think the best thing to be in this situation right now is to allow people to expect nothing from this club,” he said. “I think we can surprise some people.” \nWhy? He’s been here before, making a career out of challenging expectations. \nIn 1989, Bieser was a 32nd-round pick in the MLB Draft and persevered eight years before making his major-league debut as a 29-year-old rookie outfielder with the Mets, his third organization. He’d play parts of two seasons with the Mets and Pirates during a professional career that spanned 13 years. \nWhen Bieser turned from player to coach, he guided Vianney High School to its first state championship in 2004 and then a second two years later. At Southeast Missouri State, he inherited a program that went 23-36 the previous season then won the Ohio Valley Conference in his second, third and fourth seasons. \nNow at Mizzou, Bieser takes over a team that’s struggled to compete in the SEC — the Tigers have won just 14 of 40 series since starting SEC play in 2013 — but has quickly embraced his innovative approach to mashing baseballs. At SEMO, Bieser introduced his hitters to an intricate pitch recognition program that helped turn the Redhawks into one of the country’s most prolific offensive teams. Though his priorities at Mizzou have been pitching and defense, Bieser believes the Tigers will eventually mash once they harness the pitch recognition skills. For now, the emphasis is scoring runs by any means necessary. \n“I think the potential is that we can be a very creative offense,” said Bieser, whose 2016 SEMO team ranked in the top 20 nationally in team batting average, slugging percentage and on-base percentage. “Our goal, it’s really not saying, ‘We’re going to hit .270,’ or ‘We’re going to hit .280.’ It’s more like, ‘How do we score six runs a game?’ … We don’t want nine hitters in our lineup. We want an offense. We want everybody working for the same goal. That’s really the mentality for this team that we work as an offense. We practice every day. We practice ways to score runs whenever we can’t actually hit those types of runs, so we’ve got to find ways to manufacture runs. We’ve got to be creative with offense. We’ve got to be able to steal bases.” \nThe Tigers play their home opener March 3, the first in a three-game series against Illinois-Chicago. Conference play begins with a weekend series at Alabama on March 17. In SEC action, Mizzou hosts Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Texas A&M and South Carolina at Taylor Stadium this year, while the Tigers play road series at Alabama, Georgia, Ole Miss, Vanderbilt and Tennessee. \nLast year, in Tim Jamieson’s 22nd and final season as head coach, the Tigers ranked among the SEC’s bottom four teams in most offensive categories — last in batting average (.249), 12th in slugging (.363) and last in on-base percentage (.281) — and couldn’t capitalize on a rotation that featured steady senior Reggie McClain and sophomore phenom Tanner Houck. Houck, the Collinsville native who’s widely projected as a first-round prospect for this summer’s MLB draft, will get the ball on Friday nights this season, starting with Friday’s season opener against Eastern Michigan, the first of a four-game series in Fort Myers, Fla. Andy Toelken, a junior college transfer, will start the first game in Saturday’s doubleheader, followed by sophomore Michael Plassmeyer (De Smet) in the second game. Bieser was unsure who he’ll start in Sunday’s finale, leaving open the possibility for junior Bryce Montes De Oca, a 6-7 flamethrower who missed last season with an elbow injury but has touched triple digits with his four-seam fastball.
