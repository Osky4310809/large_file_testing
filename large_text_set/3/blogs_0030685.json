Just go to your \"Settings\" tab and enter your address to see a list of your reps and policymakers at the highest levels—including the vice president and president. And start chatting away.\nBut even though we're sure you've got plenty of things to message Donald Trump about, you're going to have to wait on that.\nSEE ALSO: New 'Tiny Trumps' meme has flooded the internet big time\nMany politicians have jumped on board with the new feature, but shooting off a DM to Trump himself is not an option. That was discovered and pointed out by ProPublica on Monday, the same day the new feature launched.\nFacebook now lets you directly message your elected reps\nExcept @realDonaldTrump , who you still have to snail mail https://t.co/MKDw3MSm71 pic.twitter.com/NPTXPVEROP\n— ProPublica (@ProPublica) March 27, 2017\nSnail mail and a call to his official office line are the only listed ways you can get a hold of POTUS. The inability to DM with a president so endlessly devoted to social media, his tweets flowing out with a fiery frequency while actual press conferences lag behind, seems a little strange. But is it really unusual given how new this feature is?\nThe truth is, a lot of reps don't have it turned on, either. When we plugged in a Los Angeles area address, we were shown the appropriate California state assembly member, state senator, state lieutenant governor, state governor, House representative, U.S. senators, vice president and president.\nJust filling in your mailing address is all it takes to find out and contact politicians representing you.\nImage: facebook.com\nBut of these nine politicians, only two were available via direct Facebook messages—U.S. Representative Karen Bass and California State Senator Holly Mitchell .\nMeanwhile, five politicians, including Trump, had only their phone numbers and mailing address listed. VP Mike Pence had the least amount of contact information listed, with just his mailing address shown.\nWith time, Facebook plans to add missing phone numbers or emails taken from sources like politicians' official sites, the company told TechCrunch . But it sounds like American policymakers are primarily responsible for getting their own info up there. And perhaps more politicians will also get onboard with direct messaging as things move forward. We've reached out to Facebook to clarify and will update with new information.\nFor now, though, you can keep sending your letters and making your phone calls. And maybe this no DMing thing is a blessing in disguise with Trump. After all, you've seen his Twitter account.\nWATCH: A reusable sponge could be the latest solution to effectively clean up oil spills", "external_links": ["https://bass.house.gov/", "https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/facebook-officially-launches-town-hall-for-contacting-government-reps-adds-local-election-reminders/", "https://t.co/NPTXPVEROP", "http://sd30.senate.ca.gov/", "https://twitter.com/ProPublica/status/846428452953755648", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/SG9DAd7W.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ShXm6JCiDE8yUappzqYP7B4rZ88=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F427997%2F47010e20-3e29-40b7-8d7c-4cb28971631c.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/SG9DAd7W.jpg", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "https://t.co/MKDw3MSm71", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7qXQmdOKe30qDJcdQh478h77cI4=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F427997%2F47010e20-3e29-40b7-8d7c-4cb28971631c.png"], "published": "2017-03-28T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:31:16.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
