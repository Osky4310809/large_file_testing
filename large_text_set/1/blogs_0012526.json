Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFor someone once dismissed by Sir Alex Ferguson as a player who couldn’t run , Jordan Henderson has been doing a lot of it this season. \nHenderson is the Premier League’s most important midfielder, the man who has completed most passes and run the greatest distance in the division... while proving himself most valuable to his team. \nThat is why his Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp openly admits “I love his attitude”, and also concedes that his team may have relied too much on their skipper this season — a fact perhaps proven as they failed to win either of their last two matches, away to Sunderland in the league and at Southampton in the EFL Cup, when he was missing. \nCertainly, Klopp will be praying his captain will be back for the visit to the lion’s den of Old Trafford on Sunday, because he knows he will need the energy and defensive intelligence of his England star to curb the attacking threat of Paul Pogba.

Maybe we relied too much on him,” the German coach admitted. \n“I don’t read what you write, so if there is not enough credit for him then do it! \n“He can’t have any more credit in my eyes. I love his attitude – it is outstanding.” Ex-United boss Ferguson's autobiography included a bizarre criticism of Henderson (Photo: Getty) \nFor his manager, it is Henderson’s appetite for the game and willingness to not only learn but sacrifice himself for the team that is the key. \nHe was good enough in a more advanced midfield position to become an England regular, but when his new club boss said he needed to drop deeper to become Liverpool’s anchor, the 26-year-old agreed readily. \nIndeed, it is that approach and desire which Klopp suggests is the only reason Henderson has a chance of playing at Old Trafford. \nWatch — How Liverpool's Anfield home has grown in the past 30 years: Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:41:20.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
