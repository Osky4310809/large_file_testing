Um, do you guys own a map? In any other, smaller state, Fort Worth and Austin would probably be in different states. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nCOTA chairman Bobby Epstein recently expressed interest in hosting NASCAR, per Autoweek . COTA, of course, is a road course instead of an oval like TMS, and it’s a full three and a half to four hours away by car from TMS. \n\nBut nope! NASCAR dates elsewhere in Texas—the second largest state in the country—fall under a regional protection clause in Texas Motor Speedway’s five-year contract with the series. \nAdvertisement \n\nGossage made short work of reminding everyone that TMS called dibs on NASCAR first to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram this week:\n\nI don’t blame [COTA] for wanting NASCAR races, it’s just that they’re 20 years too late. I don’t think they know the business, or they wouldn’t be saying such things.\nThis is asinine, not to mention pretty condescending. These tracks are 221 miles apart, according to Google—and most of those miles are on the Godforsaken hellscape of perpetual construction known as I-35. \n\nTo put this spat over Texas race dates in perspective, this is like if Homestead-Miami suddenly got up in arms that Daytona was 287 miles away, or if Martinsville decided those dweebs 173 miles away at Bristol shouldn’t get to have a race anymore.
