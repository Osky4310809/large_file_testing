A lovechild of this fixation is a kind of pared-down pink that has had fans from the word go. Bollywood, too, has taken to this shade in their recent appearances, high-fiving the colour in silhouettes of all kinds. This is a roaring success for the colour pink, after it appeared as the Tumblr-pink last year and now, at the cusp of the next season, as a shade softer but still identifiably pink. In the spirit of the belief “In 2017, pink definitely doesn’t define a personality type,” here’s how you can effortlessly work this shade in everything that you wear. 1. Sridevi works the muted pink in a glittering Manish Malhotra lehenga. Those of us who were in need of a colour-detox, you know what colour to introduce to your wedding wardrobe. Fellow Manish Malhotra loyalist, Sophie Choudry, also sported the colour recently, in a slip- anarkali . 2. Anoushka Shankar endorses the colour in a fully covering Sabyasachi anrakali that is enough inspiration for us to give this colour a shot. 3. Kangana Ranaut, who has been going through somewhat of minimal phase, picked a Anavila sari (that, with its crisp fabric, resembles candyfloss) flanked by a floral blouse in a similar shade. 4. Priyanka Chopra makes a convincing case for the colour, in her romantic Alexander Mc Queen dress. We are on board with her decision to sport a brown lip with the knee-length pale number. 5. Also, giving the colour a solid nod of approval was Priyanka Bose, who made a resounding statement in her navel-grazing, princess-y Zuhair Murad gown. 6. Alia Bhatt worked the colour in a 50s-inspired Daniele Carlotta dress that, with its ruffle-straps and calf-grazing hem, is all kinds of adorable.
