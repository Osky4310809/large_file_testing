Why becoming a tax haven would be bad news for Britain Read more \nSuspects deposited money in an unidentified Swiss bank and did not disclose that to authorities, the statement said. \nSpokeswoman Wietske Vissers said the investigation would “continue for days and weeks” across the various countries. The Netherlands is investing 3,8000 Dutch leads. \nThe FIOD said it seized administrative records as well as the contents of bank accounts, jewellery, a luxury car, expensive paintings and a gold bar from houses in The Hague, Hoofddorp, Zwolle and the municipality of Venlo in the Netherlands. \nThe people arrested, one in The Hague and one in Hoofddorp, were not identified. \nVissers referred questions about investigations in the other countries to their national police and to Eurojust, the EU agency that coordinates cross-border prosecutions, for further information. \nEurojust could not immediately be reached for comment. \nThe Dutch government has passed information to the other countries about 55,000 suspect accounts at the bank. \nVissers said she would not publicly disclose the name of the Swiss bank involved.
