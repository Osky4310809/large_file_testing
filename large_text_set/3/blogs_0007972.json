Stevie Nicol reflects back on his coaching days after Alexis Sanchez's recent falling out with Arsene Wenger. \nLONDON -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says he was \"surprised\" by reports that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain wants to leave the club, and hopes the midfielder will still be at the Emirates Stadium next season. \nA source told ESPN FC on Wednesday that Oxlade-Chamberlain is eyeing a summer move as the club have yet to offer him a new contract and he has struggled to lock down a regular starting role. \n\"I'm surprised by that because I believe that he has been developed well, he is developing well at the moment and he has been given his chance,\" Wenger said Thursday at a news conference ahead of Saturday's FA Cup game against Lincoln City. \n\"When you are somewhere, you have to want to be there first. After that, the only thing I can say is that personally I rate him highly. I showed that in the way I kept faith in him when he spent long times out injured. He's developing very well at the moment.\" \nOxlade-Chamberlain has started Arsenal's last five Premier League and Champions League games, but had more often been a substitute before that. Wenger has moved him into a central midfield role lately, but with Granit Xhaka and Aaron Ramsey available again he could have to go back to fighting for a role on the wing. Arsene Wenger said he has kept faith in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain throughout his injury troubles. \nHowever, he could get another start on Saturday as Alex Iwobi, Danny Welbeck and Mesut Ozil are all struggling to recover from illnesses. \nWelbeck had to pull out of Tuesday's Champions League loss to Bayern Munich just before kickoff, while Ozil came on in the second half of that game after missing the previous trip to Liverpool. \nWenger said Ozil \"still felt not too well after the game\" and plans to make a late decision on his involvement on Saturday. \nOxlade-Chamberlain seems to be the latest Arsenal player to grow frustrated with the team's lack of progress this season, with Ozil and Alexis Sanchez both reportedly weighing up their options amid a string of disappointing results. \nArsenal exited the Champions League after a 10-2 aggregate loss to Bayern Munich, while their Premier League title challenge fell apart in recent weeks with losses at Chelsea and Liverpool. \nWenger's own future is also in doubt , but he said he hopes Oxlade-Chamberlain will still be at the Emirates next season. \n\"I personally wish that he stays at the club because I think he's a very promising player who developed very well. He looks to have the values that we rate at this club,\" Wenger said. \nOzil and Sanchez have yet to sign contract extensions, and Sanchez was even dropped by Wenger for last Saturday's game at Liverpool after he stormed out of a training session the previous week . \nWenger, though, insisted the dressing room unrest is not affecting his players negatively. \n\"A lot has been said about that which is exaggerated. We have a good, united, determined group,\" he said. \"When you go through disappointing results, you always have some disagreements but overall the best way to respond is always in the game. We have to show how united and determined we are. \n\"Overall, on that front I don't worry. In our job, you have to be competitive and competitiveness doesn't always mean love. It is about performing. In the past, it's not the team who loves each other the most who is the best on the football field.\" \nMattias is ESPN FC's Arsenal correspondent.
