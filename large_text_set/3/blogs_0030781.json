Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSir Alex Ferguson has revealed what he saw in a young Michael Carrick - and why he knew he was always going to be a success at Manchester United. \nThe Wallsend Boys Club graduate, who moved to West Ham and Tottenham before he was snapped up by Ferguson, will play in his testimonial on June 4. \nHis former boss, who will oversee the match at Old Trafford, recently spoke out about Carrick and heaped praise on what he has achieved in the game. \nHe explained what caught his eye all those years ago, and why he, like other young footballers from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, had the right attitude to succeed. Ferguson praised Carrick's character at Man United (Photo: Matthew Peters) \n\"From the minute we bought him, his character has always been absolutely outstanding,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \n\"He's a football man and that character, plus his ability, made him a certainty to be a big success here.\" \nThe Scot said he was particularly impressed by the way he had left his home town when he was 16 and moved all the way to London.
