A controversial late moment (Photo: REUTERS) \nRanieri sent on PFA player of the year Riyad Mahrez in normal time and then expensive duo Islam Slimani and Ndidi for extra-time. \nNdidi, a £15million January buy from Genk, thumped in a rasping shot on 94 minutes. \nAnd then Gray, the bright spark for much of the night, drifted between two challenges before lashing into the roof of the net to guarantee victory. Gray thumps home to seal it (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) (Photo: Matthew Lewis) \nIt was a much-needed win for the Foxes after five games without a win, including four straight Premier League losses, and sets-up a fifth round tie at League One Millwall next week 1. Millwall next Chilwell and Christie down the wing (Photo: PA) \nA trip to League One Millwall awaits Leicester next. The Lions have knocked out Premier League Bournemouth and Watford already this season with Steve Morison netting in both games. \nMorison accused the Hornet's stars of moaning about the hosts' physical approach in the fourth round. \nSo the champions should take their tin hats and shin pads. 2. Ranieri rolls dice again Ranieri watches from the touchline (Photo: REUTERS) \nLast time Claudio Ranieri made 10 changes, it ended in a embarrassment and a record loss for an English side in the Champions League. \nIt was 5-0 in Porto in December on that occasion in a dead rubber after City had already reached the last 16, yet Ranieri was left bitterly unhappy with his nearly men: “The result is my fault but the players missed a great chance to show me their best.\" \nThis time Leicester's fringe men performed better and Ranieri's name was warmly sung by home fans. 3. FA Cup prestige damaged further \nThe live BBC TV cameras were here but both side's key men weren't on the pitch. \nWhat a shame that is for a competition that has already lost a lot of its prestige. \nWith a fifth round tie against League One Millwall up for grabs, as well as a chance to generate momentum, you would have thought both clubs were desperate to progress. Not so sadly judging by the line-ups. 4. Gray a boost for Ranieri Gray impressed for the Foxes (Photo: Leicester City FC via Getty Images) \nAfter just one win in nine League games, Ranieri must be desperate for any spark to potentially reignite his champions ahead of Sunday's Premier League game at fellow strugglers Swansea. \nThe performance of young winger Demarai Gray, 20, will have given him encouragement. \nGray is quick, can beat a man and put over a cross as he showed setting up the opener. His goal was magnificent too. \nIf reigning PFA player of the year Riyad Mahrez continues to look so lost, Gray should be given the chance to replace him. 5. Did Leicester keep receipts? Things haven't fully clicked in England for the Nigeria international (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nAs the champions continue to go backwards alarmingly in the Premier League, so the spotlight on their transfer deals becomes brighter. \nThey have not been tight, investing around £65million on players last summer and a further £15m in January. \nStriker Ahmed Musa, who cost £16milllion, started along with Nampalys Mendy, who cost £13million, and Bartosz Kapustka finally made his first start after costing £7.5million last summer. \nDirector of football Jon Rudkin must have been squirming uncomfortably in the stands as the trio struggled to make an impact against the Championship visitors' much-changed side, especially in the first half.
