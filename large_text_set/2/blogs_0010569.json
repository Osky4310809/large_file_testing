CHARLOTTE CURD/FAIRFAX NZ \nLabour housing spokesman Phil Tywford has accused the Government of \"smoke and mirrors\" over its work with Housing NZ to ease an Auckland shortage. \nSpeaking to Parliament's social services committee on Wednesday, Housing NZ chief executive Andrew McKenzie said the Crown agency intended to build 4900 new homes in Auckland over the next three years. \nREAD MORE: \nHowever, when the demolition of existing state houses was taken into account, McKenzie said there would only be a net increase of 722 houses - just over 240 each year. SUPPLIED \nBill English is being criticised for his government's response to the housing crisis. \nThe small net increase was due to the time it took to move people out of old houses into a new property, then demolish the property and create space to \"build up and out\", he said. \n\"We're at a phase where we need to create capacity to be able to utilise the land better ... to move our tenants into the new homes, free up the new land, [and] the numbers obviously accelerate after that.\" \nHousing NZ board chairwoman Adrienne Young-Cooper defended the agency's performance, saying while it had missed an \"aspirational target\" to build 2000 houses over the two years to December 2015, it had met its official performance requirements. \n\"In this financial year we have quite ambitious targets, and we're on programme to deliver those - they're in excess of what we did in the year under review.\" Ad Feedback \nThe organisation was \"going through a significant capacity build\" to ensure it could ramp up construction, Young-Cooper said. \nLabour housing spokesman Phil Twyford said Housing NZ's admission showed the Government's housing promises were \"smoke and mirrors\", with the 722-house net increase only a quarter of the current Auckland state house waiting list of 2654 families. \n\"When Bill English promised 30,000 new homes to be built on state housing land, what he failed to say was that National will barely increase Auckland's state housing stock at all, despite a burgeoning population and a chronic housing crisis. \n\"Families are living in cars and garages, and the best National can do is add an extra 240-odd state houses in Auckland per year.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:33:21.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
