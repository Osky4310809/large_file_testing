She looks happy and relaxed as she chills by the pool (Photo: FameFlynet) Chanelle heads to get another drink (Photo: FameFlynet) \n\"It's absolutely terrifying. I think because I've been so extreme with the way I've been doing things, when I do put weight on, it goes on a lot quicker.\" \nSize 18 Chanelle has also been suffering from a back injury, which has contributed to her weight gain – but doctors can do nothing about it until she sheds the excess pounds. \n\"They did just say your back's never going to get better. I need an operation on it but they said, 'We're not going to do anything on it to your back until you've proved that you can lose weight,'\" she went on.

They are keeping an eye on things. They want to do measurements,\" she added. \nIt's not the first time the former Big Brother housemates has made promises to change her ways - back in April 2016 she was grilled by Phillip and Holly after ballooning to a size 16 and having pictures of herself in a bikini spark headlines. The shower is cold too (Photo: FameFlynet) Chanelle relaxes under the water (Photo: FameFlynet) \nAt the time, she denied gaining weight in a bid to do her own celebrity fitness DVD, saying: \"With the amount of money I've spent on pizzas and doughnuts, even if I did make a DVD I don't think I could break even.\" \nThe former glamour model used to be a size 8, but blamed a food addiction for her weight gain.
