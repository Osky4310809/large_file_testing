And now, at least 214 people have been indicted on felony rioting charges, CNN reports. \nOn Tuesday, a grand jury in DC charged five individuals. This was in addition to the 209 other defendants who've been indicted on rioting charges earlier this month. […] \nThe indictment accuses the defendants of using a tactic called \"Black Bloc\" in which people conceal their identities with dark or black clothing and accessories such as scarves, sunglasses, helmets and masks. \nThey assaulted a limousine driver, smashed windows of local businesses, destroyed a government vehicle and committed \"violent and destructive acts,\" according to the indictment. \nThe defendants also caused disruption by chanting “F*** it up,” “F*** Capitalism,” and “Whose streets, our streets” as they traveled around the city, the indictment states. \nIf convicted, the protesters charged with felony rioting could face up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $25,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:00:19.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
