Payet’s family have already returned to France, and their unhappiness in London is one of the reasons why the 29-year-old has become so unsettled recently. West Ham still value the midfielder at £30m, and whilst Marseille are set to make a fourth bid, it is not expected to be at that level. Another sticking point is the bumper £125,000-a-week five-year contract Payet signed last February - it remains unclear whether Marseille are capable or willing to match that figure.
