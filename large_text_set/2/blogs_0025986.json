ADVERTISEMENT \nTheir Filipina accomplice was arrested earlier in Cavite. \nJohn Catipunan, NBI-6 special agent, said the arrest stemmed from the complaint of a businessman from Buenavista town in Guimaras. \nCatipunan said that the promised investment failed to materialize after giving the suspects a total of P42 million from 2015 to 2017. \n“Our complainant was lured through internet by the suspects,” Catipunan said in an interview over RMN Iloilo. \nThey chatted and convinced the victim to invest, he added. \n“We were able to track the IP address of the computer used by the suspects in Malaysia so we decided to conduct an entrapment operation here in Iloilo after inviting the suspects to come for another P 8 million,” Catipunan added. \nThe modus of the suspects was to befriend their victims through a Facebook account. They would convince their victims to deposit money in the bank but would later claim that they could not withdraw the money due to taxes. \nThey would again ask money from their victims to pay the taxes in exchange for a big amount once the money is withdrawn from the bank.
