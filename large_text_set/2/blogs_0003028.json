Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com) | Updated February 3, 2017 - 12:12am \"Lucky pouches\" with Chinese feng shui inscriptions for the Year of the Fire Rooster Philstar.com/Deni Rose M. Afinidad-Bernardo \nMANILA, Philippines — By nature, the rooster is not unlucky, unlike the Filipino saying, “Isang kahig, isang tuka” because every scratch brings food to the table, according to feng shui experts. \nFeng shui master and Freeman columnist Aldric Dalumpines believes that this year, the economy will be robust and businesses will advance to the next level. \n“Every time a year ends in seven, there is some form of economic upheaval,” says another feng shui expert, Princess Lim Fernandez. \nBut though the year starts with optimism, one should not be complacent because at the second half of the year, things will change quickly, Fernandez warns. \nLast year, the Year of the Fire Monkey, was a big “yang” fire, so you see things coming and they are more apparent, Dalumpines explains. \nThis year, the Year of the Fire Rooster, is a “yin” fire, a candlelight fire that flickers but can get easily extinguished, so money would be “easy come, easy go,” the geomancer says. Lifestyle Feature ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: \n“There is a three-killer star in the wealth star, so money easy comes, and easy goes,” claims Fernandez, advising one to go for more conservative investments with less risk. \nThose who will succeed this year, adds Fernandez, are those who are flexible, quick, and those who think out of the box. “If you know how to handle things properly, you can come up with creative solutions that will help.” For more money \nTo enhance one’s money luck, put money or invest in the southeast, not east, which is why investors are coming to the Philippines and other southeast countries, Fernandez says. \nIn addition, she suggests putting Php168 s in an “angpao” (red Chinese envelope) because 168 means “to be rich forever,” then deposit it to your bank account on February 16. Burn bad luck by burning tea leaves. Keep a golden egg to attract money and wealth. \nDalumpines also advises wearing an arowana ring on the fore finger of the left hand, with the head facing up, for wealth and power. Buy and sell \nFernandez says it is a good time to sell property, but to buy property, she suggests waiting until the second half of the year. \n“Sell your stocks from May to June and between September and October,” she adds. The right business \nThis year is a good time to start a business, Fernandez maintains. If you want to be successful, invest in industries engaged in mobile or media, she says. \nFor Dalumpines, it is also lucky to venture in the food industry, since the Rooster symbolizes food, eggs and chicken products. As such, he predicts there will be a comeback of grilled food and gimmick places where roasted items are the main fare, so the pun, the “Year of the Fire Roaster,” is very true, he says. \nFinally, Dalumpines wishes to clarify that “Kung Hei Fat Choi” does not really mean “Happy Chinese New Year,” but “Congratulations, may your business be lucky this year!” Lifestyle Feature ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:41:06.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
