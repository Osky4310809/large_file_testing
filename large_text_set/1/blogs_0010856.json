During the fourth and final dive, they happened upon a ruby seadragon and followed it to another, watching them both feed and move through the strong ocean swells. Sponge garden \nThe surrounding area was what Rouse calls a “sponge garden”, in contrast to the kelp-filled waters that leafy and common seadragons inhabit . These relatives of the ruby seadragon have fleshy appendages that help them move about and hide among sea kelp in the rocky reefs where they live. \nRouse says seeing the ruby seadragon alive confirms that they lack such lacy protuberances. In waters 55 metres deep, they just aren’t necessary – or even a good idea. \nFor starters, the strong currents that far down could catch them like a sail. “They don’t have appendages, just stumps where they would have attached,” says Rouse. “Where they live, it’s not useful for camouflage.” \nInstead, their colour helps them hide. Red is the first colour seawater absorbs from sunlight, so at that depth, no red light will bounce off these seadragons, making it hard for predators to see them. \nRouse’s video also shows that the creature has a curled tail similar to that of a seahorse . This is likely to be used for gripping objects and keeping in one position in rough waters, he says. \nMore on these topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:23:28.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
