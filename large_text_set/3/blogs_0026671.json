Â© Photographerv8 | Dreamstime.com \nThe advent of the smartphone has made it possible to conduct the business of life on the go. With these handy gadgets, we can store important documents, family photos, daily planners and have face-to-face conversations with the help of apps like Skype and FaceTime. Very impressive! \nThey have become such an important part of our daily lives it's hard to imagine what we would do without them. Unfortunately, millions of iPhone users are at risk of having their devices wiped at the hands of hackers. Why your iPhone could be at risk \nA group of hackers calling themselves the \"Turkish Crime Family\" claims to have gained access to a massive cache of iCloud and Apple email accounts. Access to these accounts could allow them to wipe everything from the victims' gadget remotely. They could also reset the victims' iCloud accounts. \nThe hackers allegedly have access to more than 300 million Apple email accounts. This includes people using @me and @icloud domains. \nThe cybercriminals are demanding that Apple pay them either $75,000 in Bitcoin currency or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards. In exchange for payment, the group would then delete the alleged data cache. They are giving Apple until April 7 to make the payment. \nOne of the criminals told Motherboard, \"I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing.\" \nApple has not made a public statement on the extortion attempt. It's unknown whether this threat is real, as the alleged stolen account details have yet to be verified.
