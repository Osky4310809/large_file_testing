As first reported by Autoguide , Jaguar Land Rover has filed 29 trademarks since March 13. \n-The trademarks reveal some new monikers and unearth some we’ve seen before. On the Jaguar side, filings include P-type, T-type, XJS, C-XE, iXE, diXE, XEdi, XEi, CXF, and CXJ. Although trademarks are far from guarantees of anything happening, it’s fun to speculate what could be circulating around the U.K. offices. We’d hope the T-type and P-type, if made, would follow the paths set down by the D-type and F-type sports cars rather than the S-type sedan. The XJS was a two-door grand tourer that spanned two decades starting in the 1970s, and the letter C has been used recently for the C-X16 and C-X75 hybrid sports-car concepts, so that letter could indicate potential hybrid models, or it could simply mean “coupe.” The i and di variants could signal electric (as in the I-Pace , pictured above) or diesel-electric models. We already have confirmation that EVs and hybrids are on the way .\n- \n-Switching to Land Rover, the trademarks Westminster, Freestyle, Stormer, Sawtooth, Landmark, Range Rover Classic, and Landy were filed. Westminster was a special edition for the previous-generation Land Rover, Freestyle was a variant of the Land Rover Freelander (as well as a former Ford ), the Range Stormer was Land Rover’s first ever concept in 2004, and a Sawtooth is a type of Defender wheel. Landmark was a special edition of the previous-generation Discovery, Classic is self-explanatory, and Landy is a common nickname for Land Rovers.\n- - 2018 Range Rover Velar: Mid-Size Modernity - Jaguar I-Pace Concept: 400 HP, All-Wheel Drive, Coming in 2018 - Jaguar F-Type: Reviews, Specs, Pricing, Photos, and More - -Again, none of this means the nameplates will make it to production, but it’s possible. Both Jaguar and Land Rover have been expanding their lineups in the past few years and have strong sales momentum, so we just might see a modern-day Jaguar XJS, a Land Rover Landy, or any of the other names.\n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:58:30.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
