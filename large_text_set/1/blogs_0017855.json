Fort (Healthy scratch) Johnny Maxey (Healthy scratch) Al-Hajj Shabazz (Healthy scratch) Brian Mihalik (Healthy scratch) Zach Mettenberger (Healthy scratch) Demarcus Ayres (Healthy scratch) Ladarius Green (Concussion) Ladarius Green will miss his fifth game in a row while he deals with the effects of the concussion he suffered at the hands of the Cincinnati Bengals. Even though the team had left the door open with a questionable designation on Friday, his limited participation on the two days he did practice meant his chances of playing were always slim.\nRelated: Keys to Steelers offense vs. Patriots in AFC Championship Game \nFor the rest of the inactive players, it is a case of healthier faces on the depth chart getting back into action and pushing them off the gameday roster. With the return of Ricardo Mathews and Anthony Chickillo, Johnny Maxey and L.J. Fort are the unfortunate names who are forced to make way.\nZach Mettenberger and Brian Mihalik are regulars on this report most weekends and to be fair Al-Hajj Shabazz has started to become a rather familiar addition over the second half of the season as well.\nThere had been some questions surrounding the health of James Harrison and his shoulder, the only other name on the injury report Friday. Although it will surprise no one to know he is good to go for this all important game after all.\nRelated: Keys to Steelers defense vs. Patriots in AFC championship game ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:34:28.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
