Except only one counted. \nWith about 30 seconds to go in the half, Xavier’s Trevon Bluiett pulled up for a jumper that hit the front iron and came down to Gonzaga’s Johnathan Williams. As Williams tried to secure the ball, this happened: OFF THE FLOOR AND IN! #Elite8 pic.twitter.com/3hXUWUI6P1 \n— NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) March 25, 2017 \nRaShid Gaston was the closest Musketeer to the ball, so he got credit for the “layup.” \nGonzaga then came back down the court, ate up most of the remaining clock and got a score from Nigel Williams-Goss to push the lead to 49-39. With just a couple seconds remaining, Xavier inbounded to J.P. Macura, who threw up a heave from about 3/4 of the way from his basket. And he nailed it: This didn't count but WOW! #Elite8 pic.twitter.com/YyL7pvIM0U \n— NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) March 25, 2017 \nUnfortunately for the Musketeers, the shot came just after the buzzer and didn’t count. \nSafe to say we won’t see a sequence like that anytime soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:43:52.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
