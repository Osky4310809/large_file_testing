While many can understand that inflation needs to be accounted for, the real issue is that Warcraft's account services are widely regarded as too expensive to begin with. Jacking up the price is only salting an already tender wound. \n\"What the fuck?\" writes deronscf on Reddit . \"I understand that [Blizzard] is a company and they got to make their money somehow, but transfers are something that absolutely shouldn't become more expensive than it already is. Transfers should be free in the first place, given how many dead realms are out there.\" \nAs someone who's had to pay to transfer off of a server because the ratio between Horde and Alliance players was disproportionate, I tend to agree. The culture, population, and ratio of factions on a server are all monumentally important to enjoying the game and it's impossible to tell a good server from a bad one without trying. \nI understand that [Blizzard] is a company and they got to make their money somehow, but transfers are something that absolutely shouldn't become more expensive than it already is. \nPart of the issue is that these account services are largely automated. It's not like you're paying to ship an item back to a store for an exchange. You're merely paying for a computer start a process like redesigning your character's appearance. \nPlayers are also quick to point out that services in other MMOs are much, much cheaper. For example, Final Fantasy XIV—easily Warcraft's biggest competitor— only charges €14/£12 for a character transfer to a new server. That's €10/£7 cheaper than World of Warcraft's new prices. \n\"I love WoW but I'm really soured by this artificial 'Blizzard tax' we've got, and now they have the gall to increase the prices,\" writes 8-Brit . It's obvious that in a genre that is largely free-to-play, World of Warcraft's monthly subscription, costly expansions, and expensive services is alienating to many. \nIt's not going to help come April 5, but if you were thinking about paying for any of these services and are in the EU or UK, you might consider doing it now. Many of these account services are 25 percent off until April 4. That's kind of ironic, isn't it?
