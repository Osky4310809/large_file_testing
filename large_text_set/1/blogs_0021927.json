The VC, while speaking on the results of the students, said the graduands with passes may be the last people that would obtain such results in OOU. \nAccording to him, in future, students that are not doing well in their chosen disciplines, may be advised to move to other areas where they stand a chance of finishing with better grades than passes. He said the action was in line with the National Universities Commission, NUC, standard which has abolished the pass degrees. \nHowever, the VC disclosed that the varsity’s Senate has approved that a special degree award be conferred on the overall best graduating student, Dr. Saheed Alabi, from the Obafemi Awolowo College of Health Sciences of OOU who had distinctions in seven courses out of 10 in the College of Medicine. \nHe said “In the anal of the institution, nobody has ever had such sterling result. Also, Senate has approved the introduction of new programmes such as Bsc. Nursing, Veterinary Medicine, Estate Management, Building Technology, Radiology and Music as part of growth.” \nHe said the facilities and manpower for the new programmes were already on ground while consultation was ongoing with the NUC to commence teaching of those courses by next academic session. Religious Knowledge (Education) and History (Education), he said, had not been accredited by the NUC. He blamed the problem on low patronage of the three disciplines by students but assured that the university has started putting measures in place to attract more students in future.
