A study conducted by Yoga Journal and Yoga Alliance found that there are almost 37 million yogis in the U.S., and these devoted practitioners spend more than $16 billion a year on yoga-related products. It‚Äôs a meditative, healing practice that isn‚Äôt losing its popularity anytime soon. However, just because it‚Äôs growing rapidly doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs a lot of diversity.\nWhen you look at the most popular yoga personalities on Instagram and other social media platforms, you see a whole lot of people who pretty much look the same: thin, white, and lean. People like Rachel Brathen (also known as Yoga Girl), Kerri Verna, and Caitlin Turner have amazing, jaw-dropping profiles, but they don‚Äôt tell the whole story of the yoga world . There are a whole lot of other bodies that do yoga ‚Äî and they deserve just as much attention. This list is dedicated to the yogis out there who teach yoga just as much as they teach self-acceptance, because there‚Äôs no such thing as one kind of a ‚Äúyoga body .‚Äù\n1. Jessamyn Stanley (@mynameisjessamyn) I always describe my personal yoga practice as a musical instrument that I found buried deep within myself. When I found my instrument it was (obvi) drenched in guts, blood, and emotional residue. Over the years I've managed to wipe off most of the goop to reveal a startlingly beautiful instrument. And I've gradually learned to play it- well, sort of. My instrument sounds different every day- sometimes I'm all tight and clean Suzuki method, and other days it's more like an experimental bebop thing. But every day it's MY instrument. Only mine, no one else's. As a teacher, I always want to encourage you to find YOUR internal instrument- not try to mimic MY instrument, but wipe off the guts, blood, and emotional residue of your own instrument and learn to play it your own way. In my mind, my yoga classes are kinda like a musical jam session- everyone's playing their tune, and maybe most of us are playing essentially the same song. But we're all playing our own unique instruments in an effort to peel away at the layers of internal boundaries that build up over a lifetime. Maybe the instruments thing doesn't make a damn bit of sense to you. That's cool. But that's why my yoga classes are kind of \"weird\"- because I always want to manifest a space in which every human being's experience is valid and worthy. And that can often result in more than a few f-bombs, farts, and burps, not to mention that my belly is perpetually hanging over my waistband. Because we're all weird, and we're all a little awkward, and no one need apologize for it. Shout-out to @mikefolden, @griff_j, & the rest of the @codyapp fam for putting together this coach video about me- you can watch the full length video on facebook by clicking the link in my instagram profile. A d since I'm swearing (...a lot) in the video, Facebook is restricting access. Typical. The classes filmed in this video will be available in a brand new Cody series very soon, but you can find my other classes by clicking the link below: https://www.codyapp.com/coach/jessamyn \nA video posted by Jessamyn (@mynameisjessamyn) on Nov 22, 2016 at 5:59pm PST \nThis girl is hella inspiring. Jessamyn is a yoga teacher , body-positive activist, and writer from Durham, NC who has over 250,000 followers on Instagram. Our favorite part about her is how outspoken and full of life she is. Jessamyn will make you laugh just as quickly as she‚Äôll inspire you to roll out a mat and do some yoga. Her Insta account shows you all the ways you can modify postures to fit your body ‚Äî not the other way around. It‚Äôs also just amazing to see all the advanced postures she can do.\nThis year, Jessamyn won the Shorty Award for the Healthy Living category. She motivates people of all shapes and sizes to move their body in whatever way they love most. She‚Äôs completely redefined what it means to have a ‚Äúyoga body,‚Äù and she doesn‚Äôt pay any attention to what the trolls have to say.\n2. Valerie Sagun (@biggalyoga) When you have that \"I havent practiced this pose in a long while and I was never really good at it, but i should practice it now on this sharp slanted boulder\" look. \nA photo posted by Valerie Sagun (@biggalyoga) on Oct 6, 2016 at 5:14pm PDT \nValerie shows us on her Instagram account that yoga is for every body, and that flexibility isn‚Äôt reserved for the small bodies we‚Äôre used to seeing on the cover of fitness and yoga magazines. She shows you how to use props like straps and blocks to get deeper into postures. Also, her legging game is strong . Plus, the smile on her face is so contagious that you‚Äôll want nothing more than to join in on the bendy fun.\n3. Brendon Payne (@sequellife_bp) Throw. Back. Thursday. \nA photo posted by Brendon Payne (@sequellife_bp) on Dec 22, 2016 at 8:27am PST \nBased in Orlando, Brendon is a yoga teacher who has over 6,000 inspiring Instagram posts to scroll through. He shatters the myth that big, strong guys can‚Äôt be flexible. You can see him doing yoga in all sorts of lovely spots ‚Äî the beach, out in nature, or in his very own backyard.\n\n4. Amber Karnes (@bodypositiveyoga) Day 4 of @gaiam's #propitup challenge hosted by the @ybicoalition is the wedge. This prop is great for bringing the floor to you if you've got a little decreased range of motion in wrists (put it under the heels of the hands in down dog) or ankles (like here, in malasana). Get more ideas at #propitup and @ybicoalition ü§ì \nA photo posted by Body Positive Yoga (@bodypositiveyoga_) on Sep 15, 2016 at 4:12am PDT \nHer profile picture on her Instagram is of her wearing a T-shirt that says, ‚ÄúMy body is not a problem to be solved.‚Äù Amen. Amber is a body-positive activist who shares pictures of her home practice on the regular, and she also faithfully posts pictures of herself that prove how much she‚Äôs at ease in her own skin. Also, she and her husband are too cute together.\n5. Kathryn Budig (@kathrynbudig) Teaching my last yoga workshops this weekend @savannahyogacenter for the year AND until April 2017! Come join if you can. x #aimtrue #staytrue #savannah photo: @underarmourwomen \nA photo posted by Kathryn Budig (@kathrynbudig) on Dec 7, 2016 at 10:51am PST \nShe‚Äôs an internationally renowned yoga teacher who has written two books: Aim True and The Women‚Äôs Health Big Book Of Yoga . Kathryn also teaches regularly on the on-the-go yoga and meditation app YogaGlo . Her encouragement of self-love and self-acceptance is unwavering, and she reminds us all the time on her Instagram posts that the aesthetics of yoga are so not what the practice is all about. All around, she‚Äôs inspiring AF. You‚Äôll love her bright sense of humor ‚Äî and her unparalleled love for puppies.\n6.

She‚Äôs super flexible and really knowledgable about the asana practice, so you can learn a lot from following her profile, too.\n7. Dana Falsetti (@nolatrees) Who's feeling like a Mexico retreat with yours truly? I'm loving @xinalani so much I'm thinking about coming back and bringing some of you with me. Snapchat was a unanimous yes. I'm @nolatreesyoga over there if you want to see how beautiful this place is. The open air rooms are incredible, the ocean views are unbeatable (check 2 posts back!), the stairs to climb what is essentially a giant treehouse are upping my booty game, and the food is healthy and tasty. Who's down? Coming back with or without you #xinalani \nA photo posted by Dana Falsetti (@nolatrees) on Dec 15, 2016 at 12:13pm PST \nYou can practice yoga with Dana at any of her workshops around the country, and you can also keep up with her teaching journey and practice on Instagram. She‚Äôs bendy, smiley, and has great taste in vintage-y bathing suits. If you can‚Äôt make it to any of her classes in-person, you can always practice with her online. She‚Äôs got a knack at inspiring you to explore new depths of your body, all the while encouraging you to embrace the figure you‚Äôve got at this very moment.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:35:28.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
