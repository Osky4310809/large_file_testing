By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 20, 2017 3:04 PM India vs Australia: Ravindra Jadeja produced a magical delivery to get rid of Steve Smith in Ranchi. (Source: AP) \nThe Ranchi Test between India and Australia has been a memorable one for the Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja. He hasn’t done anything wrong since the very first ball. While rest of his teammates were being hammered by Steve Smith in the first inning, Jadeja picked up yet another 5-wicket haul of his Test career, helping his side to bowl out the opposition for 451 runs. In that innings, he picked up a brilliant catch of David Warner, pulled off a no-look MS Dhoni style run out and single-handedly destroyed the Australian batting line-up. However, one regret he would have had was to not get better of Steve Smith who remained not out 178. \nWatch Steve Smith’s dismissal here: \nRavindra Jadeja’s wish was fulfilled in the second innings though when he produced a magical delivery to get rid of the Aussie skipper. The visitors were struggling at 63/3 and their captain was the only hope of saving the game but Jadeja produced a similar ball like Australian legend Shane Warne did against Mike Gatting which was named ‘ball of the century’ for the 21st century. Steve Smith who was on strike didn’t offer any stroke thinking the ball has pitched outside leg stump and will miss the wicket. \nAs it turned out, it was another incident of brain fade for the Australian skipper. The ball not only straightened enough but also took his wicket leaving Australia in deep trouble. As expected, rockstar Jadeja and the Indian cricket team were delighted. The Australian captain sparked a controversy in the Bangalore Test when he looked at the dressing room to get assistance about a DRS call. He later called it a ‘brain fade’ but that didn’t stop the Indian captain Virat Kohli from bashing his counterpart. \nWatch Jadeja’s rockstar celebrations after scoring a half-century: \nHowever, ICC did not level any charge against any player after the Test and match referee Richie Richardson will bring both the captains together ahead of the penultimate game. “Perhaps I might be able to ask a few questions. We’ll see what the mood is like at that time. Virat obviously stuck by his comments. I think it will be just similar sort of thing with Richie making sure that cricket is the winner this week,” Smith said.
