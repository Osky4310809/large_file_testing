Thankfully, the NFL scrapped using “Kiss From A Rose” this year, and the babies they used this year are all very cute. \nLet’s take a look at all of our baby doppelgängers. \nBaby Mike Ditka \nNFL\nThis is a strong Ditka look. I appreciate the attention to detail with the hair and mustache, and the custom mini Bears sweater vest is great.\n\nBaby Michael Irvin \nNFL\nThis jacket is absolute flames, and the pencil thin mustache and big diamond stud earrings bring the whole thing together. This is a phenomenal fit. \nBaby Joe Namath \nNFL\nThe hair and glasses are whatever, I’m just here to talk about this coat. How do you even find a fur like this in a baby’s size? This coat is amazing and makes me want to have a child just to get them this coat. \nBaby Bill Belichick \nNFL\nBaby Belichick absolutely nails the Belichick angry face. Great job, baby.\n\nBaby Marshawn Lynch \nNFL\nBaby Beast Mode is my favorite. Look at this child. The hair, the beanie, it’s all perfect. \nBaby Von Miller \nNFL\nThe newest addition of Super Bowl babies is little Von Miller and he is incredible. That whole ensemble is great, but the jacket really sets this apart. \nThe NFL babies are arguably the best thing the NFL does each year.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:07:57.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
