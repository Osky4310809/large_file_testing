Part of what I love about tiny tower and pocket planes, etc is how interactive it is. I feel like there's all these options - like I'm actually running a tower or transportation company, but in Bit City there's not much interaction, I feel as if I'm just pressing the same button continuously with no real reward, which is because I am. I'm hoping that in future updates of this app that they bring in a new outlook of it, perhaps making it a bit more like Sim City Not the SimCity you were looking for.. by Deygus It's cute and all but that's about as far as it goes! This game is way overhyped and a nice try but it fails to scratch that realistic old school SimCity builder that even SimCity BuildIt still does better. This game is pretty much tiny tower meets boring repetitive clicking and tapping in city form. I doubt I'll continue playing it past the next few days.. Great game by Moeden What a great game I'm already enjoying it and it's only came out like a couple of hours ago thank you no but for making such a great game again keep keep up the good work This app is designed for both iPhone and iPad Free", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:44:36.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
