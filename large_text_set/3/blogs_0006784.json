PUBLISHED: 22:15, Tue, Mar 7, 2017 | UPDATED: 22:16, Tue, Mar 7, 2017 \nThe banners read “ Arsene Wenger you’re killing our club;”“No contract;”“Stubborn, stale, clueless;””All good things must come to an end;”“Ivan Gazidis - the **** do you do.” Inside the Emirates there were no banners. Just rather a lot of empty seats. And that said it all really. \nIn his 21st year in charge, and his 184th match, rarely had the atmosphere around Arsene Wenger been as poisonous, as rancid, as this. Mind you, there were only 200 odd of them. \nIn the programme before the game Wenger was saying: “What is at stake is our pride and our honour to compete for 90 minutes.” \nThere was no doubt about that - 5-1 down from an utterly calamitous first leg against Bayern Munich and facing seven years in a row going out at the last 16 stage of the Champions League, uncertainty around his own future and a row with star player Alexis Sanchez. GETTY Arsenal fans staged a passionate protest prior to tonight's game GETTY Pressure is mounting on Arsene Wenger \nAll coming on top of yet another surrender, at Liverpool, which only sufficed once again to emphasise how far Arsenal are from being serious title challengers. \nWenger the day before this second leg had asked for “lucid rage” from his team. Initially at the Emirates last night (inside, at any rate) there was optimism and backing for the team as the Gunners, with Sanchez recalled up front following his bust up with fellow players and, apparently, his manager after the first leg, went at the Germans from the off. \nIt was, of course, an impossible task. But all the fans wanted was some fight, some passion, some pride from their team. Qualities notably missing in certain games recently. \n“Arsenal we love you,” the still faithful sang inside the Emirates - especially when Theo Walcott rifled them ahead from an angle with a superb goal in the 19th minute. Suddenly the stadium was alive with hope, songs and applause.
