We say it for bed and it puts him to sleep peacefully every time. I would like to share it with other Christian parents to enjoy with their children.” \nGod, my friend , it is time for bed.Time to rest my sleepy head.I pray to you before I do.Please guide me down the path that's true. \nGod, my friend, please bless my mother,All your children--sisters, brothers.Oh! And then there's daddy, too--He says I am his gift from you. \nGod, my friend, it is time to sleep.I thank you for a soul unique,And thank you for another day,To run and jump and laugh and play! \nGod, my friend, it is time to go,But before I do I hope you know,I am thankful for my blessing, too,And God, my friend, I love you. \n--Submitted by Michael J. Edger III MS Bedtime Prayer \nThis original Christian bedtime prayer gives thanks to God for the blessing of today and the hope for tomorrow: \nNow, I lay me down to restI thank the Lord; my life is blessedI have my family and my homeAnd freedom, should I choose to roam. \nMy days are filled with skies of blueMy nights are filled with sweet dreams, tooI’ve no reason to beg or pleadI have been given all I need. \nBeneath the subtle moonlit glowI thank the Lord, so He will knowHow grateful I am for my life", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T18:26:31.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
