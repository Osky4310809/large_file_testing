By Tom Phillips Published 27/02/2017 \nMiddle-earth: Shadow of War is yet to be officially announced, but we now know a lot more about the game thanks to a leak from US shop Target. \nThe much-rumoured sequel to Shadow of Mordor will once again let you conquer land and take down enemies using the original's acclaimed Nemesis system. \nThis time, however, you're looking to forge a new ring of power, similar to Sauron's. \nTarget's product listings have now been pulled, but not before they were pasted onto NeoGAF : \"Experience an epic open-world brought to life by the award-winning Nemesis System. Forge a new Ring of Power, conquer Fortresses in massive battles and dominate Mordor with your personal Orc army in Middle-earth: Shadow of War. Go behind enemy lines to forge your army, conquer Fortresses and dominate Mordor from within. Experience how the award winning Nemesis System creates unique personal stories with every enemy and follower, and confront the full power of the Dark Lord Sauron and his Ringwraiths in this epic new story of Middle-earth. \nSounds good to us. \nShadow of War will also be available in a Gold Edition with access to four expansions: Slaughter Tribe Nemesis Expansion, Outlaw Tribe Nemesis Expansion, The Blade of Galadriel Story Expansion and The Desolation of Mordor Story Expansion. \nTogether with a \"Gold War Chest\", these packs represent \"over $125 in total value\". \nThe two Nemesis Expansions will each let you take on a new Orc Tribe, with new missions and gear. The two Story Expansions include a new campaign and playable character - interesting. \nWarner Bros. has yet to respond to the leak - but it likely won't be long until the game is fully unveiled.
