After years of carefully weaving story lines together, Marvel has released a teaser video giving details into Marvel’s forthcoming blockbuster Avengers: Infinity War , due for release in 2018.\nAvengers: Infinity War serves as a sequel to Marvel’s The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron , as well as tying into last year’s Captain America: Civil War. The teaser video shows Kevin Fiege, Marvel Studios boss, alongside Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland and Chris Pratt giving fans a glimpse into the size of the event and how it will be a culmination of 10 years of MCU.\nThe video teases a number of exciting things to look out for in the next Avengers film, such as the Guardians meeting the Avengers for the first time and concept art of Thor’s new hammer, which will presumably have a backstory in his solo outing this summer with Thor: Ragnarok.\nIn other movie related news, watch the first trailer for new CIA thriller Unlocked starring Noomi Rapace.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T12:31:46.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
