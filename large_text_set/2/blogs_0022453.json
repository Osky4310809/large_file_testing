And his fans have, of course, taken very well to them. The most recent one he put up on his account, was a \"pillow talk\" video in which he is speaking about the benefits he's experienced after following ayurveda for 25 years of his life. In the video, Akshay was blissfully happy, because of the recent success of his film, Jolly LLB 2 , and even thanked his fans for their kinds words and messages. Post that, he talked about how he had recently spent 14 days in an ayurvedic ashram , which felt like heaven. He went on to talk about how little we, as Indians, value this \"priceless treasure\" but at the same time Akshay did not \"demean the value of allopathy\". He also added that he is not the ambassador of any ayurvedic brand, but was talking about the subject as someone who has greatly benefited by this form of healing, and urges people to be \"brand ambassadors of our body\" too. See the whole video, here.
