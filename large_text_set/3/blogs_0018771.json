Credit Mohd Rasfan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images BANGKOK — The film “Beauty and the Beast” will open next week in Malaysia despite earlier objections from the country’s Film Censorship Board over a brief scene described as an “exclusively gay moment,” two major cinema companies said Tuesday. Walt Disney Studios had refused to cut the scene to appease Malaysian censors. The cinema companies announced they would begin showing the movie on March 30. Officials from the censorship board could be not reached late Tuesday to explain their apparent reversal. The board’s decision had drawn condemnation internationally and in Malaysia. Among those objecting to it was Tourism Minister Nazri Aziz, who last week called the decision “ridiculous.” “You don’t ban a film because of a gay character,” he said, according to The Malay Mail . “All these years even without the gay character in the ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ there are also gays in the world. I don’t think it is going to influence anyone.” \n  The censorship board had ruled that a shot involving two male characters dancing in a ballroom must be cut from the movie, on the ground that it promoted homosexuality. The sequence is said to be 3 seconds long. Celeste Koay, head of marketing for TGV Cinemas, one of two major companies that will show the film in Malaysia, said the company was notified by Disney that it had permission to release the film.
