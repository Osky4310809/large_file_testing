[Laughs] He was ripped, he was like a god - he looked like Rollins! \n\"All working out, in shape, but mean and stylish and cool. He cared about his appearance then. I'm not saying he doesn't now, but he doesn't now. [Laughs] He did then - he was the frontman, he looked amazing and intimidating onstage. \n\"With those amazing songs and their live power, they were deadly. There was no band like that - they sounded like Slayer meets ZZ Top with the Van Halen vibe of fun. They had groove, that was their secret.\" \nReaching the lyrics, Sebastian added: \"And they had very intelligent lyrics, I thought, at the time. Now that there's that controversy that happened with Phil, I don't know if those lyrics were saying something I didn't even fuckin' know, which freaks me out and I hate thinking about it, but that's really none of my business.\"This is not the first time Bach addressed the Dimebash incident, as he tweeted back in late January: \"Rock is supposed to be fun. Perverting music into hate? NOT fun. People who say White Power are PUSSIES. As are those who agree. Or remain silent.\"Reaching a bit more jolly themes, Bach remembered how Dime pranked him during that same tour, saying: \n\"One time I go onstage and my lips start fuckin' BURNING! I go, 'What the fuck?!' And I start to wipe in and I wipe it in my eyes and my EYES ARE BURNING ONSTAGE!! Like, really bad! I go, 'What the fuck?!' And I turn and I look, and Dimebag is over there with a bottle of tabasco. They had doused my mic in fuckin' tabasco and it sucked, it really sucked. They were laughing their heads off.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T15:34:10.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
