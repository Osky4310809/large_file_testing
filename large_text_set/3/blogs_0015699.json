It's the only way you can conquer a world that's full of people trying to tell you you're nothing. Having a mindset like that gets you through anything. \nAnd just as you shouldn't let your life be ruled by Twitter comments, don't let every column you read be interpreted as gospel. It's insane how many people actually think I sit plotting and watching what celebs do in order to tear them to shreds every Monday. \nTbh, I don't need to do much observing, put the TV on for a few mins and people hang themselves. \nDoes that mean I sit at home rubbing my hands when I've ripped into someone? Not at all. Truth be known, I write what I see, I press send, Bob's your uncle. It's not because I don't have a conscience or because I'm evil, it's because articles are meant to be truthful, opinionated, fuel fires. CBB's sexiest housemates The sexiest ever Celebrity Big Brother housemates. Who's top of your list? 1 / 60 \nWhen I first began working with Daily Star Online, I had a flick through some of the mag columns for inspiration. What did I find? A load of false BS. Celebs treading on egg shells. Why on earth would anyone want to read something that's not real, written by an agent, or just a plug for a brand? \nOne thing I've learned is that I've missed many opportunities and screwed a lot of potential offers up with my big mouth and what I write online. \nDo I regret this? No. \nEverything happens for a reason. Brown-nosing producers and hanging out with other reality stars has never ever been my thing, I can honestly say I'd rather stick a chili up my privates than prance around organising paps to shoot my every move. \nFine, it works for some, you get in the papers in your undies taking the bins out looking like an absolute t**t, bag a few hundred quid, maybe get on a show, but for what? To sell your soul. \nIt's all panto, none of it's real. People see the Charlotte Crosbys and Vicky Pattisons and think their luck is common, it's not. Most people in showbiz live off peanuts. \nPeople automatically think they're owed something because they've been on Channel 5 or MTV, calm your tits lads and lasses, do your stint, go home and crack on, everything that comes to us is a bonus, too many begs out there gagging for a free ride through life. \nYou've been on a reality show, you ain't the next Kim or Kanye. \nDS LIKE MARMITE: Helen Wood divides opinion more than Piers Morgan \nI guess what I'm trying to say is, I've never forgotten who I am, where I came from, or who I was before I managed to slightly change public perception of me. \nI'll always be humble towards those who actually take their time to speak to me instead of just talking utter nonsense as they want a RT. I recognise those who think outside the box and see that there's more to life than 100+ likes on a selfie. \nSo just remember what matters, ey. \nThank you to those who not only read my work each week but to those who took the time to try and understand why I say things the way I do. Thank you to the readers with brains to realise there's never malice in my words, I'm just an opinionated big gob who thrives off winding up the bores. \nI'm going to love you and leave you for now as I have some blank pages to fill, keep your eyes peeled for my launch in August. \nMy Star readers, from August 2014 to now, it's been fun. \nLove always,Hels Bels xxx \nP.s Hope I've not offended too many of you over the years… just the few I intended to ;) Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T14:50:59.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
