The replacement comes after Dipika Kakar, the original Simar, quit the show to concentrate on her personal life. \nThe actress says, \"I wanted to return with a good project. The show will bring its focus back on the mother-daughter relationship; I believe I suit the role perfectly since I am also a mother.Though the character of Simar is already established, the challenge lies in adding some freshness to it. I wouldn't have taken it up if it wasn't so challenging. I am nervous and excited at the same time to face the camera after so long.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:02:38.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
