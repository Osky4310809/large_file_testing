Click here for more info. Contact Info: For reporting problems and bugs, or if you have comments or suggestions, please either send me an email (quicksaver@gmail.com) or go to https://github.com/Quicksaver/Tab-Groups/issues and create an issue, this is so I have a way to communicate with you if I need to.Tab Groups, formerly known as Panorama or TabView, allows you to manage and organize a large number of open tabs.Groups are incredibly easy to use! When you first install the add-on, the Tab Groups button will appear next to your tabs, but you can move it anywhere you want in the window. Use it to open a quick access panel to quickly switch between your groups or even to switch to a specific tab.Enter groups management view through that panel and drag tabs across groups or out of their current group to create a new one. When you're done, just click on a tab to leave groups view and go to the chosen tab; only the tabs in the chosen group will be visible. It's that simple.You can name groups, resize them and rearrange them visually however you like. Create groups for research, movies, work, fun and all the other various tasks you perform on your browser. You'll organize all those dozens of tabs you have open in no time!Or even keep all your tabs in a single group, and use the add-on to swiftly find and switch to any tab you want, without having to lose time looking for it in the middle of all your other tabs at the top.You can also customize a series of keyboard shortcuts in the add-on's preferences, to quickly enter and leave groups view, open the quick access panel, or switch to other groups using just your keyboard. Backup and Restore your tabs and groups any time you want! Everything crashes once in a while, but now you can be sure you never lose your tabs again when that happens.- Manually backup your groups information at any time to a file anywhere on your disk for safe-keeping. Later, you can restore whole groups from there, or even just a single tab if that's all you want.- You can also restore groups and tabs from several automated backups created by Firefox and Tab Groups:-- Current Session Recovery : Firefox keeps your current session's information here, to be used in case of crashes. You probably won't be using it much, since whatever groups and tabs you close will be removed from this file as well.-- Session Recovery Backup : holds much of the same information as the file above, also used for crash-protection. But it's usually saved with a little delay, so it could be useful in a few cases.-- Previous Session : ever restart Firefox to see only your homepage, and all your other tabs gone? Or maybe just forgot to bookmark an important tab from yesterday? More often than not, you can get it all back here.-- Firefox Upgrade Backup : every time Firefox upgrades, it holds onto a backup of your session at that point for a while, just in case the upgrade fails and corrupts the session. These should help if all you need is to get your tabs back from before the upgrade.-- Tab Groups Update Backup : similar to the above, but for backups created when this add-on updates instead.-- Groups Migration Backup : this is a backup of your session made when Firefox first updated to 45. If you've installed Firefox only after, or if you installed this add-on before that happened, then you likely will never see (or need) this.-- Groups Manual Backup : if you keep the default file name and save location when backing up your groups, you can also access them from the quick access menu when restoring.-- Session Manager Backup : these are session files kept by Session Manager , which is fully compatible with Tab Groups.-- Tab Mix Plus Backup : similar to the above, these are session files kept by Tab Mix Plus , which is also fully compatible with Tab Groups. Other features: - There are several different layouts available, as well as many display options; set them to your taste so that your groups always work to your advantage.- Start typing anywhere in groups view to search for a specific tab .- Use catch rules to automatically move tabs to specific groups by means of regular expressions.- Integrates with Tab Mix Plus 's options to style unloaded and unread tabs. Notice : this add-on is based on the Firefox feature of the same name that was removed in Firefox 45. Initially, it was barely more than a copy of that same code that existed in Firefox itself. Since then, almost all of it has been rewritten, not only to improve performance and stability, but also to implement several new features. Despite this, the concept of groups at the core of the add-on remains the same, but hopefully even more awesome than ever. Hidden preferences : I suggest you don't change either of these, so that the add-on adjusts automatically to your environment. extensions.tabgroups.forceBrightText - Define which theme to load in groups view. \"0\" is the default value, the add-on will choose based on your current Firefox and system themes; \"1\" will always load the light theme, and \"2\" will always load the dark theme. extensions.tabgroups.overrideViewportRatio - Set the aspect ratio for the tab thumbnails. Keep empty to let the add-on adapt to your screen size; any integer or fraction in the form \"width/height\" will be used as a constant aspect ratio for tab thumbnails.
