A Level 1 infraction — for things like having 17 or fewer lug nuts or failing to meet minimum weight — will carry a 10- to 40-point penalty, a one-to-three week suspension and a fine of $25,000 to $75,000. \nA Level 2 penalty for things that traction control or illegal fuel additives or testing would up the ante to 75 points, a six-week suspension and fines of $100,000 to $200,000. \nThe at-track inspection procedure is changing, too. \nFrom now on, there will be three inspections: A weekend-opening inspection that covers only fuel systems, engines and safety equipment, followed by pre-qualifying and pre-race inspections. \nPer NASCAR, “Pre-qualifying and pre-race will consist of a full inspection – fuel systems, engines, safety components, chassis, templates, and weights and measurements.” And if a car flunks any of the inspection stations, it has to go back to the garage and repeat every single part of the inspection. \nIt should make for an interesting start to Daytona Speedweeks, which begin Friday with two practices for the Advance Auto Parts Clash, the first from 5-5:55 p.m. ET, with Happy Hour from 6:30-7:25 p.m. Both practices will be televised live on FS1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:12:59.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
