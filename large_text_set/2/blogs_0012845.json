It includes Tumucumaque Mountains national park , the largest tropical forest park in the world. Photograph: Daniel Beltra for Greenpeace One large dam has been built in Amapá, destroying hundreds of square kilometres of forest, and many small- and medium-sized dams are planned. The energy generated goes to the grid and rural people in the state have little or no electricity. Photograph: Daniel Beltra for Greenpeace The dams stop navigation, affect fish production, and have killed the famous tidal bore on the river Araguari. Photograph: Daniel Beltra for Greenpeace Since a Brazilian government moratorium was declared on new soya planting south of the Amazon, Amapá state has become the new frontier of the global agribuiness. Its rapid expansion threatens protected land and forests and has attracted speculators and fuelled land-grabbing.

Photograph: Daniel Beltra for Greenpeace Large- and small-scale gold, iron ore and manganese mining in Amapá state drives roads into the pristine forest, attracts miners, and devastates the land. Photograph: Daniel Beltra for Greenpeace Water pollution from mining is now a chronic problem, with dangerous levels of mercury found hundreds of miles from the mines, and fish catches affected. Photograph: Daniel Beltra for Greenpeace There are 10 groups of indigenous peoples in the state of Amapá. The biggest are the Waiimpi, with about 1,200 people who were only contacted 50 years ago. All have demarcated land and depend on river fishing for survival. The oil companies say they will not be affected by drilling, but the groups say that contamination at sea affects their rivers. Photograph: Daniel Beltra for Greenpeace The mangrove forest of the huge Cabo Orange national park on the coast of Amapá could be seriously affected by any oil spill. The largest continuous area of mangroves in the world protects the coast from storms and is Brazil’s most important fish nursery. Fishermen say any pollution would devastate their industry.

Greenpeace is campaigning to protect the recently discovered Amazon reef off the coast of Brazil from development by oil companies, such as BP and Total. These ultra-deep wells would be at least 400 metres further below the surface than that of the Deepwater Horizon, which spilled an estimated 5m barrels of oil across the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Photograph: Daniel Beltra for Greenpeace The Cabo national park is one of the world’s most important sites for birds, with flamingoes, scarlet ibises (pictured), and more than 400 other species recorded in its wetlands, mangroves and coastal areas. Photograph: Daniel Beltra for Greenpeace Nearly 1bn tonnes of mud and silt are washed down from the Andes into the Amazon each year, forming or eroding flood plains, or being swept far out to sea by the “plume” of the greatest river on earth.
