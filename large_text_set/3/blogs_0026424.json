(Photo: Getty Images) Share Get Liverpool FC   Could   \nSo much of what we as fans remember in football consists of the great players. \nThe amazing talent who is able to produce special moments in a game, making you draw breath in \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" as they spin past a defender or smash one into the top bins. \nThese memories were not exactly created regularly by the pros you're about to be reminded of. \nAhead of the Liverpool Legends vs Real Madrid Legends charity game at Anfield this weekend, we've plumbed the depths of these two giants' history to bring you these unique starting line-ups. \nLadies and gents, we give you the WORST Liverpool and Real Madrid XIs ever... Liverpool's worst ever XI GK: Charles Itandje (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nIn three years as a Liverpool player, the Cameroon international managed just seven cup appearances. There was a reason he wasn't trusted in the Premier League. DF: Paul Konchesky (Photo: PA) \nFollowed manager Roy Hodgson from Fulham to Anfield in summer 2010, and the left-back's Reds career was very much like his manager's. \nBrief, confusing and not very good. DF: Djimi Traore (Photo: Getty) \nA cult hero with the Anfield faithful, he might just be the worst player to take part in a Champions League Final. How he got a medal, we'll never know. DF: Torben Piechnik (Photo: Getty Images) \nAlways a staple on these Liverpool lists, Danish defender Piechnik played in the first ever Premier League meeting between the Reds and Manchester United at Old Trafford. \nAmazingly, the Reds only conceded two goals. DF: Jan Kromkamp \nJan Kromkamp had a very short stay at Liverpool (just eight months), and made almost no impact whatsoever. \nThis picture probably just about sums up his own reaction at signing for the club. MF: Christian Poulsen (Photo: Getty Images) \nFor those who don't remember Poulsen's Liverpool career, simply look at how fast, dynamic and hard-working the current Reds midfield are then think of what the opposite would look like. \nThat was him. MF: Joe Cole (Photo: John Powell) \nNow before you start, we KNOW that Joe Cole was a fine player, but if we're talking about just his Liverpool career here then he simply has to be in the team. \nIt was in August 2010 that Cole made his Reds debut against the Gunners, only to be promptly sent off just before half-time. It didn't get much better. MF: Alberto Aquilani (Photo: Getty) \nLook up the term \"flop\" in the dictionary, and you'll likely see a picture of the £20m signing from AS Roma. FW: Harry Kewell (Photo: PA) \nYes, he was wanted by the likes of Barcelona and Milan before opting for Liverpool. Yes, he won the Champions League in 2005. \nBut let's not forget he was booed by fans at a time, was regularly injured, never consistently fulfilled his potential and eventually left for Galatasary on a free transfer. FW: Iago Aspas (Photo: Getty) \nSince leaving Anfield he's proven himself to be a pretty handy player, but Iago Aspas didn't exactly do anything to show it during his year at Liverpool. \nRemember THAT corner he took against Chelsea? FW: Milan Jovanovic \nLiverpool really did have some rubbish at the beginning of this decade didn't they? Real Madrid worst XI GK: Jerzy Dudek (Photo: Real Madrid/Getty Images) \nWe'll make him honorary captain/manager of these teams as he is a Liverpool goalkeeping legend, but his four years in Madrid were as confusing as it was pointless. DF: Raul Bravo (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nThis *might* be a little harsh, but the Spaniard who came through the ranks never set the world on fire in six years at the Bernabeu. \nAnd the less said about that loan move to Leeds United the better... DF: Jonathan Woodgate \nVoted Los Blancos' worst signing ever, his debut for Real Madrid remains the stuff of legend (he scored an own goal and then got a red card). DF: Walter Samuel (Photo: Getty Images) \nA strange one, as he was without doubt one of the best centre-backs in the world when he joined Madrid from Roma in 2004. \nHe never got going there, however, and left after a season to recover his reputation at Inter Milan. DF: Julien Faubert (Photo: Getty) \nBecause if you wanted to win league titles and European Cups, why wouldn't you sign a West Ham substitute who falls asleep on the bench during games? MF: Thomas Gravesen (Photo: Getty) \nEffective at Everton, no good at Real Madrid. We wouldn't say that to his face, though... MF: Asier Illaremendi (Photo: Angel Martinez) \nHyped up as one of Spain's brightest young midfielders, he also never fulfilled his potential at the world's biggest club and was shipped out after two years. \nWill probably be best remembered in recent years thanks to David Moyes' pronunciation of his name MF: Royston Drenthe (Photo: Getty) \nSo much was hoped for the Dutch winger when he signed in 2007 after a string of impressive performances for Feyenoord and the Netherlands U21s - but for a variety of reasons his career fell off a cliff. \nRetired from the game at the age of 29 in order to focus on being a rapper. FW: Julio Baptista (Photo: Getty) \nNicknamed \"The Beast\" but the only thing beastly about him was how poor he was for Real Madrid - and his subsequent loan spell at Arsenal, for that matter. FW: Nicolas Anelka (Photo: Getty) \nIn his one season at the Bernabeu he scored two goals in 19 league appearances before being sold back to his first club PSG. Not quite what you're after from a £22m striker. FW: Javier Saviola (Photo: Getty) \nAfter failing to fulfil his full potential at Barcelona, he then proceeded to do so at a raft of other European clubs, including Real Madrid. \nIronically he'd probably fit quite well in a front three featuring himself, Anelka and Baptista... There we have it, the worst Liverpool and Read Madrid XIs ever.
