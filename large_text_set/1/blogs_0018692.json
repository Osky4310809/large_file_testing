Tottenham Hotspur It is a private members club with an enormously big cost attached Tottenham Hotspur 14 It also offers chances to entertain while in corporate hospitality \nPaying punters shelling out £339 each, or £9,500 a season, will get behind-the-scenes views of the players tunnel before, during and after the game, and will be able to watch the match from just behind the dugouts. \nTottenham insist their stars love the idea of fans being able to watch them in the tunnel, but when asked about it yesterday their manager Mauricio Pochettino afforded himself a wry smile as he admitted: “It’s dangerous, very dangerous because there have been a lot of things that have happened in the tunnel. \n“It is for that reason, the price of sitting there will be very expensive!” \nFinally, the crème de la crème is the \"H Club\", a members club which will offer Michelin starred food at the chef's table or with a Spurs legend - but it is an eye-watering £535 per person - or £15,000 a season. Tottenham Hotspur You will be able to dine at the chef's table or with a Spurs legend - probably not Roberto Soldado Tottenham Hotspur 14 Built on the site of the old White Hart Lane, the stadium will be the biggest club ground in London \nTickets for both the Tunnel Club and The H Club must be bought in pairs – and before you are eligible to buy those you must first stump up £30,000 for a couple of memberships. \nAccess to White Hart Lane’s Oak Room, the most expensive seats at the club at present, costs supporters’ £10,000 a season - and Spurs’ faithful will have to pay more at the new ground . \nRegardless of the corporate nature, it is still sure to send Spurs, currently playing in the modestly-sized White Hart Lane which will disappear as the new ground is build on top of it, into the category one of the world's biggest clubs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T10:30:16.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
