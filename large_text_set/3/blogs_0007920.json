Have sex when you reach home to keep up with life and career, say researchers. sex and relationships Updated: Mar 08, 2017 08:40 IST Agence France-Presse A healthy sex life with your partner could be unknowingly giving your career a boost.(Images: Bibliophile./Facebook) \nHaving sex after you get home from a hard day at the office can give your work a boost the next day, claims a new research. \nCarried out by a team from Oregon State University, the University of Oregon, and the University of Washington, the researchers followed 159 married employees over the course of two weeks and asked them to complete two brief surveys each day. \nThe responses showed that employees who had made time for sex at home reported more positive moods the next day once back in the office, and this better mood in the morning led to more sustained engagement in their work and job satisfaction throughout the workday. \nThe effect was seen even after the researchers took into account marital satisfaction and sleep quality, which are two common predictors of daily mood, and appeared to last for at least 24 hours. \nIt was also equally strong for both men and women. \n“We make jokes about people having a ‘spring in their step,’ but it turns out this is actually a real thing and we should pay attention to it,” said Keith Leavitt, one of the study’s co-authors, “Maintaining a healthy relationship that includes a healthy sex life will help employees stay happy and engaged in their work, which benefits the employees and the organizations they work for.” \nLeavitt also explained that because sex triggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with the reward centers in the brain, as well as oxytocin, a neuropeptide associated with social bonding and attachment, it is a natural mood elevator with benefits that can last well into the next day.
