At a press conference before his inauguration he fielded a question about claims that the Russian intelligence service secretly taped him in a hotel room in Moscow and said he warns his staff about hidden cameras.\n“I always tell them, anywhere, if I’m leaving this country be very careful, because in your hotel rooms, and no matter where you go, you’re going to probably have cameras. I’m not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category. And number one I hope you’re going to be good anyway. But in those rooms you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small, modern technology … You can’t see them and you won’t know. You better be careful or you will be watching yourself on nightly television.”\nFor at least a dozen of Trump’s properties — including Mar-a-Lago, now known as the winter White House — American Integrated Security Group has installed cameras and servers, the company said. In a marketing brochure , AISG touted its work at the Trump National Doral Resort & Spa. In the first phase alone, the company said, it installed “over 100 cameras”, and another 50 in phase three. The Trump Doral’s security team “likes the low profile cameras that look like smoke detectors,” the brochure states. Some of the cameras, including those used for license-plate recognition, have high resolution, according to the pamphlet, and the servers can save video for 30 days.\nOn Thursday, a company official, who asked not to be named, declined to comment and referred calls to The Trump Organization. In September, an AISG official, who also did not want to be named, said, “The coverage is regular security and employee monitoring. They want to watch their employees.”\nNeither the Trump Organization or the president’s press office responded to requests to comment. Calamari, the company’s director of surveillance, also declined to comment, referring a reporter to the Trump Organization.\nID: 10718013 If you have stayed at a Trump property, tell us your story by emailing trump@buzzfeed.com .
