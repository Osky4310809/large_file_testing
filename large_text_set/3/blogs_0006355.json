Ovie Omo Agege, \nAnnouncing his defection on the floor of the Senate, Senator Omo- Agege said his movement became imperative, following the irreconcilable leadership quagmire in the party. \nOmo-Agege also said he had to listen to his constituents who asked him to move over to the party at the centre where they could benefit more from federal government’s development drive in the country. \nNotifying the Senate of his decision to decamp to the APC, Senator Omo-Agege, who cited Order 43 of the Senate Standing Order as amended, however, sought the permission of the President of the Senate to make personal explanation on the matter. \nSpeaking further, Senator Omo- Agege noted that the division within the Labour Party, which had culminated in Comrade Bobo Adou and Alhaji Abdulkadir Abdulsalam simultaneously laying claims to the national leadership of the party, compelled him to defect to APC. \nHe added that the division in the party had rendered the administration of the party ineffective at the federal level.
