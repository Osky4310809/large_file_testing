Shkreli is, of course, infamous for the price hike of an anti-parasitic medicine, Daraprim, in 2015 and has been a notorious figure on the internet ever since. It all began when Shkreli sent Duca a direct message inviting her to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration later this month, “I would rather eat my own organs” she replied publicly. I would rather eat my own organs pic.twitter.com/IgeCRZqk8w \n— Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) January 5, 2017 Shkreli went on to change his profile image to a photo of Duca and her husband with Shkreli’s face photoshopped in over his. He also changed his banner image to a collage of photos of Duca and his bio to read “also i have a small crush on @laurenduca (hope she doesn’t find out),”. \n— Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) January 8, 2017 Twitter has since intervened and suspended Shkreli’s account. “I will miss Twitter but my love for Lauren will never die.” Shkreli told Breitbart News in the wake of his suspension. Duca recently appeared on Fox News with Tucker Carlson where she defended the man who harassed Ivanka Trump on a JetBlue flight last month. Since appearing on Fox Duca has been a target for criticism on social media. At the time she tweeted “Ivanka Trump is poised to become the most powerful woman in the world. Don’t let her off the hook because she looks like she smells good.” Ivanka Trump is poised to become the most powerful woman in the world. Don't let her off the hook because she looks like she smells good. \n— Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 23, 2016 She’s also been a vocal critic of president Elect Trump, penning a scathing editorial calling him a “sexual predator” and that his rise to power “has awakened a force of bigotry by condoning and encouraging hatred.” In a bizarre twist to the Shkreli-Duca Twitter feud a new meme has been born after this man chimed in: @BadassGinsburg @laurenduca @everywhereist have kids get married and be happy- feminism leads down a dark path of cats, pizza, and wine \n— Alan John (@GorillaRadio_Tv) January 6, 2017 Other Twitter users have flooded the conversation with photos of themselves with wine, pizza and cats:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T00:10:50.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
