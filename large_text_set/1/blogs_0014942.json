But the one who came out of it the worst was Kim. Read More Kim explodes at Nicola during a house task (Photo: Channel 5) But Kim came out of it the worst, Aisleyne says (Photo: Channel 5) \nShe said Nicola acted \"like she's in a gang\". Why Kim? Because she's the only one to stand up to you, and you don't like it? Gang my ass; she's lucky I'm not in there with Nic, THEN she'd know how a real girly gang looked! \nKim slammed Nicola for swearing and brought her two boys into the mix. Don't do that. Don't you dare talk about Nicola's children or question her mothering skills based on what they watch on TV. Above anything, Nicola is one of the best mothers that I've ever come across. How she held her cool I will never know, but will forever be in awe of her for it. Well done, my darling. \nThen when Kim nominated Nicola she called her \"Nicole\". Nicola said \"it's Nicola\", to which Kim shouted \"SHUT UP\". Now you know you're in a Nut House for sure when you're not even allowed to say your own name! Read More Rylan says it all kicks off during tonight's CBB nominations (but Kim, Chloe and Jessica are exempt) \"How Nicola held her cool I will never know\" (Photo: Channel 5) \nThey had another altercation later which ended with Kim shouting in Nic's face saying, \"Shut up you cow, shut up you b***h\", plus some other nonsense about Nicola being in a gang again. \nNow I'm sorry, but how is Kim being allowed to lord it around the house shouting in the housemate's faces? I got called into the diary room anytime I had a tear up in the house. \nIn fact, what I want to know is, how did this woman pass the Big Brother psychology test? She is absolutely unhinged! I'm guessing she must be the psychologist's cleaner. Read More CBB's Kim Woodburn confuses Chloe Ferry for prostitute and urges her to switch to escorting \"Is she the psychologist's cleaner?\" (Photo: Channel 5) \nI'm so proud of my girl Nicola; she's standing up for herself and the other housemates who Kim tries to shut down. Good girl. You can take the girl out of Camden but you can't take Camden out the girl. We've both seen a lot of crap in our years and I'm so proud of the woman she has become. Such a pity that Kim can't see it as Nicola could have been her biggest ally in there. \nMoving on, I was surprised James Jordan went last night. I liked his persona in the house, he made for good TV. There's a few fence-sitters in there, and that's just dull! \nPoor old Jasmine Waltz got booted out the back door on Sunday evening and so had her interview with Emma Willis last night. She delightfully told us all she's used to getting it in the back door, not leaving by it.... Nice. Thanks for that, Jaz.
