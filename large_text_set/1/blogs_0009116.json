The 28-year-old star took home the award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, absolutely stealing the Golden Globes in the process. \nHere are the five times that Emma Stone showed the rest of Hollywood how to work an awards show: 1. Her Arrival \nFrom the second Stone arrived at the venue, she absolutely slayed the step and repeat.

Her Dress \nHer Valentino dress was a clear standout amongst other Hollywood elite attending the show. Her response to Ryan Seacrest asking her about the dress was really what made the whole ensemble perfect: \nWell, it’s pink and there are stars on it. \nBURN! SUCK IT, SEACREST! REX/Shutterstock 3. Her acceptance speech \nThrough tears, Emma thanked her mom, brother and “Doug” for helping her make it through almost exactly 13 years of living in LA. She then went on to thank the standard group of Hollywood people (studios, execs, Ryan Gosling, etc) for helping her get to this point. 4. That standing ovation \nOn top of all that, Stone got her ex Andrew Garfield to give a standing ovation while she accepted her award, making us all feel something real deep down in our feels. andrew garfield standing and clapping while emma stone walks to the stage to receive her award pic.twitter.com/aKOIblwqfs \n— best of stonefield (@stonefieldpost) January 9, 2017 Andrew Garfield gave Emma Stone a standing ovation so i'm holding on to some hope pic.twitter.com/wo014wAUu2 \n— lauren yap (@itslaurenyap) January 9, 2017 5. Ryan Reynolds and Andrew Garfield’s kiss \nIf you blinked, you might have missed this moment from the show. \nWhile Ryan Gosling was walking up to accept his award, Ryan Reynolds and Andrew Garfield got mouthy with each other.
