Reilly, Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman both against the monstrous primate and each other.\nViewed as a precursor to the events of Legendary Entertainment’s 2014 film, G odzilla , this “MonsterVerse” is going to be further expanded in 2020 when both monsters battle each other in Godzilla vs. Kong .\nKong: Skull Island hits theaters March 10.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:14:32.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
