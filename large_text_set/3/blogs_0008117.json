Locals are too often caught in the crossfire, as they told RT’s Murad Gazdiev. \nA fortnight ago, the Suleiman family were hiding in their home, waiting for the liberation, but lived through another tragedy instead. \n“One morning, ISIS fighters came to our house and banged on the door, saying they wanted to go on the roof. We begged them to leave, saying there were women and children here, but they didn’t care,” one family member told RT at the Rojava hospital in Erbil, located 100 kilometers from war-torn Mosul. \n“They went up and started shooting, so we began to flee... and that’s when the airstrike hit. There was nothing left of the house,” the young man added. \nOut of the 25 members of the Suleiman family, 15 were killed, 7 injured, and their house was demolished. \nThis tragedy is just one of many examples, not only of Islamic State’s (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) violence, but also of civilians being caught in the crossfire between terrorists and the US-led coalition. Asked who was to blame, a man lying on the bed said: “It was the [US-led] air force. It was jets,” he says.

It is a deep injustice,” a local said. \nThe Suleiman family’s story is one of many. Most of those treated at Rojava have been separated from their families, lost their loved ones in the fighting, and they all bear the scars of the war – even the children. \n“ISIS came and kicked us out of our house. We ran looking for a safe place, and suddenly there was an explosion. My father was injured, and my brother was killed. My other brother and sister were hit in the head, and I was hit in the shoulder,” a little girl told RT. \n“I don’t want to go back to Mosul, I want to stay here. It’s calm here,” she added. \nThe operation to free Mosul has been going on since October, with 200,000 people fleeing the city in the past several months. About 50 percent of them are children, according to UNICEF. An estimated 750,000 people still remain trapped in Mosul. \nA new phase of the battle started on February 19, aimed at liberating the western parts of the city still under IS control. \nOn Tuesday, the head of the Iraqi Army’s Counter-Terrorism Force reported that the Iraqi Army has regained control over 60 percent of western Mosul, and a day earlier, Iraqi forces recaptured a key local government complex in central Mosul, encompassing the Nineveh Governorate headquarters, a courthouse, a branch of the central bank, a police directorate, and a Turkish consulate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T10:26:32.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
