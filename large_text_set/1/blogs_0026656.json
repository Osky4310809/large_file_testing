Adeyemi, 3 Olorunsogo Avenue, Ayetoro-Itele, Ogun State, +23480826662: \nThe Katsina State University was recently reported to have banned all religious fellowships on its campus with the exception of the Muslims Students of Nigeria. \nThe Nigerian Bar Association and all our National Assembly members are keeping quiet while our country Nigeria is being systematically set on fire by the flagrant violation of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which guarantees unfettered freedom of worship. \nAs Nigeria may not survive a religious war, a stitch in time, they often say, saves nine. That unfortunate ban should be discarded. \nCopyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
