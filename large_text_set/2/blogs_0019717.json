Most Popular Perfect ACT score for Rocky Point junior \nThirty-one percent of Massachusetts’ public high school graduates scored a 3 or higher on an AP exam in 2016, the report said. The highest score on the exams is 5. \nMaryland, which had held the top spot since 2009, was second, followed by Connecticut, Florida, California and Virginia. \nThe College Board said 27.3 percent of New York public high school graduates scored a 3 or better on AP tests, up from 26 percent in 2015. The state showed a 6.7 percent increase in those scoring 3 or higher over the past decade. Education LI students in college-level courses \nNational participation on AP exams “continues to grow, but what is more important is that performance continues to improve,” said David Coleman, president of the Manhattan-based College Board, which sponsors AP courses and tests, the SAT college admissions exam and other assessments. \n  \nThe number of public high school graduates taking at least one AP exam has almost doubled in 10 years, from 645,000 for the Class of 2006 to 1.1 million in the Class of 2016, the data showed. \nThe William Floyd school district in Suffolk County is among systems on Long Island that have increased their number of AP offerings. In the 2015-16 school year, about 70 percent of William Floyd High School students who took the exams scored a 3 or better. \n“Increasing the number of AP courses benefits the district by raising overall academic standards,” said Donna Watkins, director of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. “William Floyd students now have several more opportunities for college and career readiness.” \nThe district has 15 AP courses at the high school and is adding one more for the 2017-18 school year — AP Computer Science. It previously had added the AP courses Calculus BC in 2013 and Spanish Language & Culture in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:43:51.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
