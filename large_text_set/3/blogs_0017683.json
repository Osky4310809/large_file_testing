He helps us better understand where we all came from with every easy anecdote. Plus, he’s pretty delightful to watch.\nBut Neil deGrasse Tyson’s “Pi Day rap ” has got to be one of the greatest things the scientist and entertainer has ever done for modern learning. While visiting The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , Tyson unveiled the hilarious music video . The day of his visit was, of course, March 14 – aka “Pi Day” for all you number lovers out there. And if you don’t know what Pi Day is all about, well, Tyson is here to drop a beat while dropping some knowledge.\nMath’s favorite irrational circle circumference number is well loved in the math and science communities. Usually, people approximate it to 3.14 or just simply use the symbol π. But some people pride themselves on memorizing as many digits as possible of the famous number.\nOf course, you don’t need to know much about Pi in order to appreciate the gloriousness of watching Neil deGrasse Tyson rap the numbers like a badass. The sick electronic beat mixed with the intense ways Tyson says each number will make anyone gain a new appreciation for Pi.\n\nTyson also used his The Late Show appearance to chat with Colbert about Pluto’s planet status, the world’s largest telescope, and climate change. You know, all sorts of wonderful science-y stuff.\nHe encouraged us to try and get our “science mojo” back . He said that science doesn’t wait for anyone. So we need to be curious and continue to ask questions . And we need to be willing to invest in finding their answers.\nAnd if Tyson promises a sweet rap with every major scientific discovery, we are all about it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T06:41:11.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
