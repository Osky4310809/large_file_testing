Rodriguez) Share Tweet \nBeyoncé seemed like the safe bet going into Sunday’s Grammy Awards, considering that Lemonade was a legitimate pop-culture event. But Adele ended up pulling off a huge upset by winning Album Of The Year, Record Of The Year, and Song Of The Year. In the days since the ceremony, a number of people have expressed their disappointment at Adele’s win for Album Of The Year, including Solange and Adele herself , both of whom believe that it should’ve been Beyoncé’s award. \nNot everyone thinks the Grammys got it wrong, though. According to reports from the New York Post and the New Zealand Herald , Ice-T and Carlos Santana (of all people) are decidedly Team Adele. Ice-T says that Adele is “hard to beat” because she “is the business” and “is good,” and though he thinks it was pretty much a toss-up between her and Beyoncé, the fact that Adele came out and said that she thought Beyoncé deserved to win “made it fly.” Mostly, though, Ice-T is proud of Chance The Rapper’s wins for Best New Artist, Best Rap Performance, and Best Rap Album, because he remembers when the Grammys didn’t acknowledge rap at all and he’s glad that has changed. \nAs for Santana, he says that Adele won “because she can sing, sing,” and if that seems like a safe, popular opinion, he veered off wildly with his take on Beyoncé. He says her music is “more like modeling,” in that her songs are “music to model a dress,” which makes her “not a singer, singer.” He did preface that by saying “with all respect to Beyoncé,” though, so he’s not trying to insult her, he’s just saying that she’s a model and not a singer. \n  Filed Under: Music, Adele, Ice T, Carlos Santana More Newswire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:22:45.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
