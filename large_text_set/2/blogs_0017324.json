Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com TownNews.com Content Exchange \nJUPITER, Fla. • His first day on the job this spring, Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith spent time with an old teammate on the back fields and saw quickly one of the things he feels the Cardinals missed as their defense went wonky last season. \nJose Oquendo. \n“If you’re a Cardinal baseball fan it was tough,” Smith said Tuesday of watching the team’s erratic fielding last season. “It was the total opposite of what we were accustomed to. Oquendo not being there last year was a big part of that.” \nSmith is the first of the Cardinals’ Hall of Famers to appear at spring training in the instructor role. Bob Gibson, Lou Brock, and Willie McGee are all expected to appear at some point. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny and general manager John Mozeliak make the invitations, and this year Matheny said there are some things the instructors are going to be asked to focus on – and some people. \nThe most obvious addition to the Cardinals’ spring training schedule is this large acreage of time on the schedule for independent work. Smith, shadowing Oquendo, will be available to work with players during that time on anything they want. If they want to talk baserunning, he’ll talk baserunning. If they want to talk hitting, he’ll talk hitting. Most are going to want to talk fielding, and so he’s got his glove and his experience and his thoughts ready to talk fielding. Late on Tuesday, as the fields cleared of the major leaguers, prospect Elizier Alvarez was brought over for some independent work at Oquendo’s urging. \nAlvarez, a hot-hitting second baseman who starred in Class A Peoria and was one of the leading OPS players in all of the minors, has been working with Oquendo on his fielding for months. He introduced himself to Smith and this is the group that gathered around him to help out: Oquendo, Smith, coach Oliver Marmol, and catcher Yadier Molina. \n“I felt really honored to be next to two important figures in the baseball world like Yadi and Ozzie,” Alvarez said afterward with the aid of a translator. \nSmith also spent some time with shortstop Aledmys Diaz. \nDuring his week with the Cardinals, Smith will spend as much time with Diaz and Diaz wants, and there has already been ongoing conversation between the two. Asked about Diaz on Tuesday, the 13-time Gold Glove winner lauded the second-year shortstop’s bat and what he sees there in the field. \n“He has great potential,” Smith said. \nIt was about 11 months ago that Oquendo and the Cardinals decided that he would not be with them at all during the 2016 season. For years Oquendo had been the third-base coach and infield coordinator. He would move the infielders around by trends, by statistics, by feel, and most of all by instinct earned through the seasons of doing that job. Oquendo declined an offer to be the team’s bench coach because he didn’t want to be “half of a coach” and not take the field, he told Rick Hummel. Oquendo could not take the field because he needed knee surgery, and his recovery would be problematic for someone on the playing surface. \nSo he remained in Florida, and he would later in the year work with some of the Cardinals’ young infielders, like Delvin Perez and Alvarez. This year, Oquendo will serve as a special assistant to Mozeliak and his assignment will be defense, defense, defense. He’ll work with young players as well, and this spring he’s giving individual attention to the major-league fielders – however, whenever they seek it. \nThe Cardinals’ defense, which cost them last season and was as Smith said “uncharacteristic,” began to fray in spring training. Smith said he’s been told this spring’s focus is to avoid that from happening again. \nIt’s not the Cardinals’ way. \n“I think last year was uncharacteristic of the organization, so I think this year there is a lot more emphasis this year on making sure you get back to the fundamentals and having a point of reference,” Smith said. “If you have good, sound fundamentals then you have a point of reference. I think they lost their point of reference last year. Trying to get it back.” \nMore on Smith's visit and his work with Diaz and others in Wednesday's Post-Dispatch. \n-30-", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:30:40.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
