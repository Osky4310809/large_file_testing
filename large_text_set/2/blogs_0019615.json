And I am the man. No matter what people say, I am the man, especially in America.\" By James Dielhenn Last Updated: 21/02/17 1:17pm Deontay Wilder, the world heavyweight champion from America, must be let off his leash before Anthony Joshua invades his territory. Sky Sports explains whyâ€¦ \nThe most senior of the world heavyweight championship triumvirate, Deontay Wilder's days as a mere prospect are long gone. With Anthony Joshua now breathing down his neck, the time is now for the WBC king to embrace his wild side. \nJoshua's welcoming of Wladimir Klitschko, the long-ruling don of the division when Wilder's reign began two years ago, means the American should be obliged to dive into similarly difficult challenges. The first step of that process for Wilder as he recoveries from bicep and hand injuries is against Gerald Washington, live on Sky Sports on Saturday night. Get to know the charismatic Deontay Wilder... \n\"Our goal in 2017 is to unify the division so we need others that want to put their title on the line,\" Wilder exclusively told Sky Sports last December. \"If you're at the top, no matter who you are - especially if you're a belt holder - we want you.\" \nHe might not have realised that he is the hunted, as well as the hunter. Joshua's plan to conquer the United States has so far been restricted to press conferences alongside Klitschko, who he will fight at Wembley on April 29 live on Sky Sports Box Office . The wheels are clearly in motion to turn Joshua into Britain's premier export to the States, and he's gunning for locations that have largely eluded Wilder. Five obstacles Wilder must overcome \nLas Vegas and New York. Wilder took Bermane Stiverne's world title at the MGM Grand Garden Arena and defended it against Artur Szpilka at the Barclays Center, but both boxing strongholds have remained just out of his range ever since. Four out of five title defences, including this weekend's, will be in Wilder's home state of Alabama so perhaps he needs the incoming threat of Joshua to safeguard the keys to America's hottest venues. \nIn one fell swoop, Wilder could smash down the doors to Vegas' most iconic locations while undertaking the most significant fight of his career in Joshua. It's a prospect that leaves boxing's bigwigs salivating. Two good looking, well spoken, massive heavyweights with tremendous credentials were to meet for a total unification of the heavyweight division - that's a massive fight. Lou DiBella \n\"If down the line, you're looking at Joshua and Deontay, two good looking, well spoken, massive heavyweights with tremendous credentials were to meet for a total unification of the heavyweight division - that's a massive fight,\" Lou DiBella, Wilder's promoter, told Sky Sports . You can see his point. Live Fight Night International", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:18:21.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
