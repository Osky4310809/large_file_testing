It will be a RAW exclusive show, and it will take place on July 9th at the XL Center in Hartford, CT. This marks the first WWE pay-per-view to take place at the XL Center since No Way Out in 2000. The first Bad Blood pay-per-view took place on October 5, and marked the first-ever \"Hell In A Cell\" match, which saw Shawn Michaels defeated The Undertaker after Kane made his debut and interfered. There were two more Bad Blood pay-per-views - in 2003 and 2004 - which were RAW exclusive shows.\nNo ticket information or pre-sale code was given for this year's Bad Blood . \nFollow Raj Giri on Twitter at @RajGiri_303 .
