As seen earlier, the upcoming XC60 draws heavily upon its XC90 big brother for styling cues, starting with the “Thor’s Hammer” full-LED headlights, and wears a more sloping silhouette, particularly with a more slanted rear screen and D-pillars. \nUnder the hood, the latest Drive-E range of engines can be expected, and like the earlier test mule, the unit here sports a charge port on its front left fender panel – a plug-in hybrid. Volvo has exhibited such an example in the shell of the pre-facelift XC60 , which previewed the PHEV powertrain of the XC90 T8 Twin Engine. \nIn the XC90 T8 Twin Engine variant, the plug-in hybrid powertrain produces 407 hp and 640 Nm of torque; similar numbers can be expected from the plug-in version of the XC60, should the same powertrain be employed here. \nOn the safety front Volvo is so well-known for, the upcoming XC60 will be equipped with a suite of active safety features, possibly including the Intellisafe Auto Pilot autonomous driving function, as well as a host of other passive safety features, including Safe Positioning to minimise spinal injuries from vertical forces should the car run off the road.
