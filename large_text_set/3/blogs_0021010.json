Talking to women, teaching them, and holding their faces in my hands has taught me that the most beautiful people I know radiate something special which reflects balance, happiness, and nourishment. \nAchieving this balance is to accept that it's a lifelong journey. One part of this balance is considering what we put on and in our bodies, which, when done wisely, makes us more equipped to handle the stresses of life. This ability is vital, as stress can negatively impact all of the systems of the body. And since our skin is our largest organ, in order to look good, we MUST feel good. \nConnecting to nature on every level is really important to my stress reduction, self-care, and wellness practices. Here are some of my favorite ways that I take care of myself every single day. Morning Photo credit: Tamara Muth-King \nMy morning ritual is really important to me as it sets the tone for the rest of the day. After waking up I'll boil some water and add lemon or ginger to stimulate my digestive fire. I then like to sit as close to nature as I can, by a window where I can feel the breeze or, if I'm able to sit outside, as close to the ground as possible. I'll meditate wherever I land for 10-20 minutes. I buy fresh flowers every week (my faves are lilies and tulips), and if I can't get outside to meditate, I'll use them to connect to nature. \nNext, I'll move my body through yoga poses before hopping into the shower. One of my favorite and easy routines is to dry brush or exfoliate my body with a scrub, Éclair Naturals Himalayan Salt Scrub . Brushing or scrubbing my skin is great to exfoliate, boost my circulation, and detox my lymph. If I’m feeling sluggish or jet lagged in the morning I'll add a couple of drops of peppermint oil to the floor of my shower and magically transform it into an invigorating spa experience.
