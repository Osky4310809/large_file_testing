Close share panel Image caption The capsule, buried by Richard Bacon and Katy Hill, was meant to be dug up in 2050 \nA Blue Peter time capsule has been accidently dug up by construction workers 33 years earlier than planned. \nThe Millennium Time Capsule was buried under the Millennium Dome, now the O2 Arena, in 1998. \nFilled with viewers' mementos of the time, it was not supposed to be unearthed until 2050. \nThe O2 has said despite being damaged, the capsule's contents are safe. The BBC said the capsule will be re-buried. Image copyright BBC/AP Image caption A Tellytubby, Blue Peter badge and Tamagotchi were among the items buried \nFormer Blue Peter presenters Katy Hill and Richard Bacon buried the capsule in June 1998. \nA spokesperson for the BBC said: \"Although a little earlier than anticipated, we're looking forward to sharing these memories with our viewers and making new ones as we return the capsule to the earth so that it can be reopened in 2050 as originally planned.\" \nIn a competition, viewers had been asked to asked to submit ideas for items they would like put inside. \nThe winning entries included roller blade wheels, an asthma inhaler, Tellytubby dolls, a France 1998 World Cup football, a picture of a dove to symbolise peace in Northern Ireland and a Roald Dahl book. Image caption The capsule was buried beneath the floor of the Millennium Dome, which has since become the O2 Arena \nA spokesman for the O2 Arena said: \"The team at The O2 and our contractors ISG have been searching for the Blue Peter Time Capsule since we started construction work in 2016. \n\"We found it yesterday but sadly it was accidently damaged during excavations. The capsule and its contents are safely stored in our office and we've let the team at Blue Peter know. \n\"We're going to work with them to either repair or replace the capsule and bury it again for the future.\" \nThe BBC said: \"We are looking forward to sharing these memories with viewers and making new ones as we rebury the capsule until 2050.\" \nHave you ever made a time capsule?
