Besides receiving alerts when upgrades are available, cruisers will have a better idea of how likely they are to actually receive one when they place a bid. Additionally, bidding fees start out low; if a low bid is accepted, cruisers can snag higher-level cabins for less money than they would have paid to book that type of stateroom in the first place. \nThe only potential drawback to the program is that bids can be placed on cabin type (ocean-view, balcony, mini-suite, suite, The Haven) only -- not on specific categories within each type or on specific cabin numbers. \nMeanwhile, travel agents have the choice to opt out of the program, but those who do participate will receive commission on approved upgrade bids for their bookings without having to do any additional work. Agents are notified when alerts are issued to their clients and will be notified a second time only if a client places a bid and that bid is accepted.
