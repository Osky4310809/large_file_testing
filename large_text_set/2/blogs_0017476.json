The project involves the delivery, installation and commissioning of radar systems on Navy vessels as well as delivery of simulators, establishing depot level facilities and integrated logistics support with deliveries spread over 10 years. \nThe proposed radar is based on the latest solid state technology and also suited for coastal surveillance applications. A Defence Ministry said in a statement: “Procurement of SSR is part of Indian Navy’s plan for modernisation of its fleets. It would also be installed on the ships under construction.” \nDanish partnership \nSukaran Singh, MD and CEO of TASL, said: “We are the first private sector Indian company to bag the coveted contract of the SSR project. Undertaking the responsibility of complete manufacture and assembly of a radar for the Navy gives us an excellent opportunity to showcase our prowess of development and assembly projects in high technology areas.” \nNISL has partnered with Terma A/S of Denmark on this project to undertake the manufacturing, integration and testing of the radar system, involving transfer of technology. \nJens Maaløe, President and CEO of Terma, said: “We see this contract between MoD, Government of India and Nova as a very important milestone for Terma as we strongly support the Make in India initiative. This initiative will further strengthen our well-established collaboration between the two companies.” \nFacilities at TASL’s Combat Management Systems development centre will be utilised for the project, which involves integration of the radar with a variety of weapon and sensor systems on different class of vessels of the Navy’s Battle Assets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:49:11.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
