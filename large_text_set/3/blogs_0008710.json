The employee told investigators, “ When I am working hard, I go to these images to take a mental break. ” \nMeadows also mentioned an employee at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) who confessed to watching averages of two and six hours of pornography a day while at work in 2013. \nCraig Ulmer, the EPA Deputy Assistant Inspector General, told reporters at WRC that misuse of government computers is prohibited, and said that cases like these constitute time fraud. \n“ That’s classified as fraud, waste and abuse, \" he said. \" They should be working on their EPA projects. ” US govt allows child porn suspect off hook in bid to protect #Tor hack method https://t.co/Y2Z7VTRQre — RT America (@RT_America) March 6, 2017 \nMeadows is calling for a “ zero tolerance ” policy, and said watching pornography on a federal computer “ should be grounds for removal. ” \nThe bill includes an exception for employees working on investigations that require accessing a pornographic site. \nThis is the third time that Meadows has introduced legislation that would prohibit federal employees from accessing porn at work. The bill was first introduced in 2014, then reintroduced in 2016. \nThe bill will now go to the House floor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T06:07:45.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
