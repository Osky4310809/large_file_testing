Developed by Smoking Gun Interactive in partnership with Microsoft, Castle Siege introduces the classic real-time strategy series to Google’s platform following its debut on Windows Phone in 2014.\nThe Castle Siege gameplay revolves around growing and defending an empire as one of several civilizations, including the Britons, Franks and Kievan Rus. With a focus on resource management similar to other mobile strategy titles, players can also train troops and raid other players to earn achievements and climb to the top of the leaderboards.\nCastle Siege is already available on both Windows Mobile and iOS, but Smoking Gun says that the cross-platform save system means you could load your game on an Android device, even if you last played on another mobile platform.\nSee also: 15 best Android multiplayer games 1 week ago Smoking Gun Interactive was founded by a team who previously worked on Company of Heroes at Relic Entertainment.
