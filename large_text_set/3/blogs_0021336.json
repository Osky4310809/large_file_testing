After accounting for iOS 10, there just isn't enough storage for today's ballooning app sizes, as well as music, photos and videos.\nAside from the storage bump, which should please people who take a lot of photos or shoot a lot of videos (especially in 4K resolution), the rest of the iPhone SE's features remain the same.\nIt's still got basically the same specs as the iPhone 6S, including an Apple A9 processor, 2GB of RAM, Touch ID fingerprint sensor, 12-megapixel rear camera, 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 1,624 mAh battery. And the screen is still a 4-inch Retina display with 1,136 x 640 resolution.\nWhen we reviewed the iPhone SE a year ago, we called it \"the most powerful 4-inch smartphone ever,\" and said it was \"affordable and it easily fits in one hand.\" The iPhone SE is still all those things, but now it comes with more storage, making for quite the bargain.\nWATCH: This ingenious toilet paper tray will keep your iPhone safe in the bathroom", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/DmTbrHX3.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/DmTbrHX3.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-21T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:50:51.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
