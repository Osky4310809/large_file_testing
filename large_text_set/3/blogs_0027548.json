Thankfully there are many natural remedies, like teas, that can help with bloating , no matter what the cause may be — and we need all the help we can get, because according to science, women naturally bloat more than men do.\nWe know that’s not exactly the best news to stomach, since bloating is one of the most annoying things we have to deal with in this lifetime, but bloating comes more naturally to us . That’s because women’s colons are 10 centimeters longer than men’s . Plus, we have a lot more in our abdomen than men do — fallopian tubes, uterus, and ovaries — so our colon is constantly competing for space. Not to fret, though. We’ve rounded up some of the best teas that will help you zip up your favorite pair of jeans again.\nHere are 7 teas to ease your bloating .\n1. Fennel Tea Shutterstock There are gas-reducing oils in fennel that can help your stomach deal with any kind of bloating-causing foods, such as cruciferous vegetables, greasy fried chicken, or a massive plate of pasta. Fennel has a very specific taste, but you’d be surprised at how lovely it is when it’s made into a tea. Steep some crushed or whole fennel seeds in boiling water for 10 minutes, then enjoy.\n2. Ginger Tea Shutterstock This powerful herb contains the compounds gingerols and shogaols, which relax your intestinal muscles and reduce inflammation. Which is exactly what you need to get rid of gas and bloating. Put several thin slices of fresh ginger (don’t use the crushed ginger you find in the spice rack) into a cup of boiling water, cover it, and let it steep for about 10 minutes. A touch of honey certainly wouldn’t hurt.\n3. Hibiscus Tea Shutterstock Not only is hibiscus tea a pretty sight to see, but it has compounds like flavonoids that affect the hormone called aldosterone, which regulates the balance between water and electrolytes. Your tummy will be much less likely to store all those unwanted fluids if you sip on a nice cup of hibiscus tea .\n4. Chamomile Tea Shutterstock Traditionally, chamomile tea is served at the end of a night, as it’s meant to help you drift off into a peaceful sleep. But it’s also a natural remedy to soothe your upset, bloated stomach . Chamomile naturally has anti-inflammatory and anti-spasmodic properties, so that bloated tummy of yours won’t even stand a chance. You can get chamomile tea bags at any basic grocery store.\n5. Lemon Tea Shutterstock A few slices of fresh lemon in hot water can do wonders for your bloated belly . There’s a component of the citrus rind oil called D-Limonene, which wards off any water retention or flatulence you may be dealing with. Lemon has been used for diuretic and medicinal purposes for a long, long time, so you might as well give it a shot and see if it works for you.\n6. Peppermint Tea \n\nAccording to the University of Maryland Medical Center, peppermint is the perfect antidote to bloating , since it helps your digestive tract get rid of your built up gas. Peppermint contains menthol oil, which doesn’t only smell good — it has an anti-spasmodic effect on your digestive tract , soothing inflammation and reducing stomach cramps. Steep some fresh mint leaves in boiling water or use some peppermint tea bags from your local shop.\n7. Caraway Tea Shutterstock You may not even have caraway seeds in your pantry, but if you’re the kind of person who suffers from bloating, you might want to stock up. Caraway seeds are antimicrobial and they have carminative properties, which reduce bloating and help your intestines find relief . Crush up some seeds into a cup of boiling water and let steep for a few minutes before you sip.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:01:30.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
