This year's manoeuvres began on Wednesday. \nThe North will \"mercilessly foil the nuclear war racket of the aggressors with its treasured nuclear sword\", an unidentified spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army (KPA) was quoted as saying by the official Korean Central News Agency. OPINION: Kim Jong-nam attack reveals true nature of North Korea \nHe said the North's reaction will be the toughest ever but didn't elaborate. \n\"Should the US imperialists and the South Korean puppet forces fire even a single shell into the waters where the sovereignty of our Republic is exercised, the KPA will immediately launch its merciless military counter-actions,\" the statement said. North Korea fires ballistic missile \nThere is renewed worry in Seoul and Washington because North Korea test-launched a new intermediate-range missile in February. It also conducted two nuclear tests last year. \nSouth Korea's military said on Thursday that it will \"resolutely\" punish North Korea if provoked. \nThe ongoing drills are field training that will run until late April. As well, different training involving computer-simulated war games will start in the coming weeks. \nThe United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a deterrent against a potential aggression from North Korea. The Korean peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. \nThe US plans to send the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35B and Osprey aircraft, according to a US Forces Korea spokesman. The B-1B and B-52 bombers could also join the drill, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. \nSome 3,600 US soldiers are expected to join the Foal Eagle exercise this year. \nSouth Korea and the United States also agreed to strengthen cooperation on financial sanctions against North Korea in response to the recent missile test. \nUS Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and South Korea Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho expressed \"great concern\" over North Korea's February 12 missile launch and promised to follow through with sanctions, said in a statement on Thursday after a call between the pair. \nOn February 12, North Korea launched a Pukguksong-2 ballistic missile near the western city of Kusong. The missile flew east about 500km before falling into the Sea of Japan (East Sea), according to South Korea's defence ministry.
