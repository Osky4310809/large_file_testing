The main theme up for discussion this year is Responsive and Responsible Leadership Related Articles Finance sector continues to strengthen SA in global competitiveness \nJohannesburg - President Jacob Zuma’s decision not to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos in Switzerland was made at the last minute. \nThe arrangement was communicated at short notice – soon after it came to light that Sipho Pityana, chairman of AngloGold Ashanti, would be one of the senior businessmen attending the forum. \nIn November, the mining boss launched a fiery campaign among ANC veterans to have Zuma removed from office. \nDonald Liphoko, director-general of the Government Communication and Information System, told City Press’ sister newspaper Rapport twice this week that Zuma would definitely be leading the South African delegation to Davos. \nFinance Minister Pravin Gordhan would also be part of the delegation, he said. \n“There is a little confusion trying to coordinate the diaries of the various ministers – that is why it is still not entirely certain which other ministers will be in the delegation,” Liphoko added. \nOn Thursday, the WEF – an international organisation which advocates public-private cooperation and hosts the annual meeting of world leaders, business moguls and celebrities – released a list of the guests expected. Pityana’s name was on it. \nOn Friday morning, Zuma’s name was on the programme for some of the sessions at the forum. \nBut on Friday afternoon, the presidency unexpectedly announced that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa would be leading the delegation. \nOther ministers who will accompany him are Gordhan, Minister of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency Jeff Radebe; Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies; Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel, Water Affairs and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane; and Sihle Zikalala, the KwaZulu-Natal ANC chairperson and MEC for economic development, tourism and environmental affairs. \nMokonyane and Zikalala are among Zuma’s most trusted allies. \nPatel’s department has prepared a report on the country’s economic performance in 2016 which will be circulated at Davos. In the report, it states that South Africa experienced a tough year, but that a recession was averted thanks to a collective effort between government, the business sector and unions. \nThe South African delegation is attending the forum under the banner of Brand SA, a joint marketing partnership between government and business. \nGordhan, accompanied by his director-general Lungisa Fuzile, will try to protect the country’s credit rating. \nIn a report, released on Wednesday, ratings agency S&P Global warned that South Africa was at risk of a downgrade . \nEconomists agree that the risk is high, but cite the possibility of economic conditions improving this year. \nA South African business delegation is also expected in Davos. \nTALK TO US \nWhat do you make of Zuma’s cancellation of his attendance at Davos? \nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword DAVOS and tell us what you think.
