It’s a car that always comes up in the context of tarmac shenanigans—track days, autocrosses, and general acts of on-road hooliganism. This assumption—fed by the low-profile tires and big, pretty wheels—is wrong. It’s downright amazing on dirt. \n\nAdvertisement \n\nLone Star Rallycross held two glorious days in a row of dirty fun during some of our coldest days this winter: one to make up an event that kept getting rained out, and the other, as a make-up for the similarly delayed 2016 season ender. The Subaru Legacy wagon I usually used for sideways dirt hilarity wouldn’t start at all in the freezing temperatures, so someone else offered to let me drive their GTI Mark 7 for the day. \n\nPhoto credit: Christopher Stryker Holy crap, what a revelation. \nAdvertisement \n\nDriving something smaller and nimbler than the beloved beater wagon I’m used to was incredible. As soon as the turbo kicked in—much faster than the mid-nineties wagon I’d been driving—the GTI was a little rocket ship. \nThe suspension and wheels were stock, but it handled on dirt like the car was supposed to be there. Its short wheelbase made it easy to put exactly where you wanted in the tight course of cones and dirt, and all you had to do to get the rear end to kick out for an upcoming turn was lift mid-turn. Stab the brake with your left foot if you need to get just a little more sideways. It was perfect. \nEven the DSG dual-clutch transmission didn’t skip a beat. For much of the weekend, I just let its do its thing in with the transmission in “drive” with Sport Mode on. The only time the DSG really struggled to drop down to the right gear was in a really slow, silty turn near the back of the course. Otherwise, shifts were near-instantaneous—faster than I could have done it with a manual, anyway—and pretty smooth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:58:34.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
