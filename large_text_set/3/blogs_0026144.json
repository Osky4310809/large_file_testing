The diagonal is not sufficient. The reason for this is mathematics – more precisely, geometry. \nThe LG G6 has an aspect ratio of 18:9 (or 2:1) and a diagonal of 5.7 inches. Because of the form factor, this means that, in comparison with another 5.7-inch display: it’s narrower, but taller. Nevertheless, there is less space on the display. In comparison with the Nexus 6P , you can see: the 16:9 Nexus has a display area of 89.6 cm² while that of the LG G6 is only 83.8 cm². So, we are dealing with a difference of about 6 cm² (the rounded display corners of the G6 are not taken into consideration). 5.7-inch LG G6 (left) vs. 5.2-inch Nexus 5X (right): the difference is clear in these screenshots. / © AndroidPIT \nWe face a very similar problem with the Galaxy S8 and the S8 Plus: both will probably have the 1,440 x 2,960 resolution, which gives an aspect ratio of 2.06:1 (or however Samsung will refer to it). \nAn example illustrates the situation: if the Galaxy S8 appears with the 16:9 format, the display would be 92.74 cm² in size. However, because it will have a different aspect ratio, the display is expected to be only 85.38 cm². For comparison, the Galaxy S7 Edge presents a display area that is 83.39 cm². Narrower, but taller: what difference does it make? \nThe new form factor requires a tradeoff, especially for games, because they can’t switch to the native resolution of the display. Either there are black bars at the edge, or the content at the top and bottom is cut off. To demonstrate this, here is a screenshot from Sky Dancer: 16:9 or 2:1? That is the question here. / © AndroidPIT Sky Dancer \nIn everyday use, on the other hand, the taller display results in more content being visible. So, on a web page, there are more lines displayed in articles and a messenger can show more messages. It’s also clear that this can differ from app to app. Thanks to Nougat’s standard ability to adjust the display size of icons and text, the effect can also be slightly modified.
