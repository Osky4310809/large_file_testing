Then again, it’s the only way these snobby elitists know how to reach their audience: by being in front of a camera. It doesn’t matter how absurd or ridiculous when it comes to the finished product. If they’re saying something liberal, it’s a brave call to arms, except that it’s not. Prior to the official Electoral College count, Hollywood, which hates Middle America and was one of the contributing factors to President-elect Donald Trump’s upset win over Hillary Clinton, tried to lobby Republican electors to not vote for Trump. Or at least have enough of them cast their ballot for someone else to deny him 270 votes. That predictably failed. Then, they demanded that Congress vigorously oppose Trump and block his agenda. \nThe latest video from the Hollywood Left isn’t overtly anti-Trump in the sense that they explicitly say that they don’t want the president-elect to succeed. It happens to be a rendition of Gloria Gaynor's 1979 “I Will Survive” released days before Trump is inaugurated as the 45 th president of the United States, featuring Emma Stone, Natalie Portman, Amy Adams, Matthew McConaughey, Chris Pine, Hailee Steinfeld, Felicity Jones, and Taraji P. Henson (via WMagazine ) [emphasis mine]: “I Will Survive\" is exuberant, a little overwrought: \"At first, I was afraid; I was petrified,\" Gaynor emotes. \"Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side.\" The track breaks out into a jubilant, thumping beat as the singer cries out, \"Did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh, no, not I, I will survive.\" And while the song has long been interpreted through a socially conscious lens, it's the kind of anthem we need now more than ever with the inauguration bearing down on us. With an impending Donald Trump presidency, I will survive. \nTo that end, Oscar frontrunners (many of them recent Golden Globe honorees) like Emma Stone, Natalie Portman, Amy Adams, Chris Pine, and Taraji P. Henson lend their vocal chops to a reimagining of the 1979 classic. Their dramatic interpretation of \"I Will Survive,\" part of W's Best Performances portfolio, is just the antidote for a still-grieving Hollywood, many members of which were outspoken Hillary Clinton supporters over the past year — and a few of whom have found themselves on the unfriendly end of Donald Trump's Twitter account. \nYeah, welcome to American elections, where often times your guy (or in this case gal) doesn’t win. Should we expect four years of this? With that said, I much prefer this video :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T17:40:15.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
