Image copyright Pete Moore Image caption Large numbers of people have travelled to Start Bay to try and spot the whale \nJames Wright, curator of the National Marine Aquarium, said it was \"very surprising\" to see the whale in Devon. \nHe added: \"We would expect to see four or five around the Scottish Islands, but not necessarily around here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:44:56.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
