Starting on March 17, St. Patrick’s Day, they’re introducing River Domes, clear enclosures that will keep guests dry and safe from rain or even Smarch snow as they enjoy glasses of wine by the river. \nWe're excited to announce the River Dome experience at City Winery Chicago Riverwalk. Book a dome for 2-6 people from... Posted by City Winery Chicago Riverwalk on Friday, February 24, 2017 Prices range from $600 for a group of six for a 90-minute session, $125 per person for groups of four or five, and $150 per person for groups of two or three. The price includes a carafe of wine per person (three glasses) and a charcuterie and cheese board. The bubbles will burst on April 30, as the domes are only a spring fling designed for impatient Chicagoans who want to be outdoors no matter the temps. Curbed Chicago first reported on the domes. The domes will not only keep guests dry and safe from high wings, but they’re also heated and come with a Bluetooth speaker. The Tribune reported that the domes were tested at City Winery’s West Loop location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:09:14.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
