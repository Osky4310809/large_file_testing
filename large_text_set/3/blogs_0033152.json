The group was then given the cold through nasal drops and put in a hotel for five days. \nOnly about 75% of the people actually caught the cold and a person's state of isolation didn't make them more or less susceptible to the virus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:47:53.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
