Through NEFT, an individual or a company can electronically transfer funds from any bank to any individual or company having an account with any other bank in the country. \nWho can transfer funds using NEFT? \nIndividuals, firms or corporates maintaining accounts with a bank branch can transfer funds using NEFT thereon. Even individuals, who do not have a bank account, can deposit cash at the NEFT-enabled bank branches providing instructions to transfer funds using NEFT.
