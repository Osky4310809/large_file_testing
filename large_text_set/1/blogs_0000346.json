But it's even better with pasta , because pasta makes everything better. The classic Italian sauce has always been one of my favorites, and once I discovered how much better it tastes homemade than out of a jar, I've never gone back. The intoxicating smell of basil will draw you in as you make this incredibly easy recipe, and you won't be able to resist licking the spoon. \nFor quite possibly the quickest and easiest Summer weeknight dinner, get a pot of water going while you make the pesto, cook a pound of the pasta of your choice, and toss with the pesto when it's done. Do your friends and family a favor and share, or save the rest for yourself for a killer leftover lunch or dinner.
