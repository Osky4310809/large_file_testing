Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) to run against him in the 2020 presidential election.\nTrump made the comments in an interview on Saturday with Jesse Watters of Fox News, calling the chance to run against the liberal senator \"a dream come true,\" the Washington Examiner reports .\nWatters mentioned the potential for Warren challenging Trump in the 2020 election.\n\"I hope so,\" Trump said. \"That would be a dream come true.\"\nTrump also said that Warren was bad for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\nTrump and Warren's feud throughout the 2016 election has carried into Trump's administration. Trump has called Warren \"Pocahontas\" due to her claim of Native American ancestry when getting a position as a professor, while Warren has gone after Trump for his rhetoric and business practices. Warren also endorsed the 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\nIn February, a poll showed that in a hypothetical matchup between Trump and Warren, Trump would be ahead by six percentage points.\nThe post Trump Wants Elizabeth Warren to Run Against Him in 2020 appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:17:15.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
