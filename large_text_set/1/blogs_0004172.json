CBS13 went on a ride-along with CHP to find out.\n“Whether it’s texting, talking, GPS — you have to have it mounted somewhere in your vehicle,” said Officer Hertzell.\nHertzell says drivers have no more excuses when they get pulled over, but the only time drivers can hold their cellphone while driving is when they are calling 9-1-1 during an emergency.\nHertzell adds “anytime you are imputing anything into it, it’s against the law while driving other than swiping.”\nUsing your cell-phone at a stop sign or a red light is also something CHP officers are screening for.\nThe new law isn’t just causing a spike in CHP patrols; one accessory store in Sacramento is seeing a huge increase in car-mount purchases.\n“Right before Christmas we got a huge sale in people coming in wanting to buy this for others,” said Paul Simon, co-owner of Mobile Accessories USA.\nSimon says he has been ordering double the amount of car mounts every two weeks, just to keep up with the demand.\n“They’ll come in and say ‘I want a car mount’, and they are looking for certain styles for their phone,” Simon added.\nAlthough Simon is making a big profit because of the new law, he says he’s just glad drivers are taking their safety on the road more seriously.\nDrivers violating the law for the first time could be fined at least $162. Every violation after that carries at least a $285 penalty.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T05:04:44.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
