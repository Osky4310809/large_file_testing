Got it! \nEvery chef has a specialty, a food realm in which she has unique creativity. Mine is soup! And the good news is I love sharing my secrets. \nHere are five that you can incorporate when making any soup recipe you love: Advertisement ♥ + 1. Start with a great stock or broth. \nThe first secret of great soup making is learning to make great broths and stocks. They’re the rock-steady foundation on which fantastic soups are built, like a powerhouse rhythm track to a soaring melody. \nTake my nana’s chicken soup: Like most cooks of her day, she threw the bones into the stock, but her trademark was to take the vegetables out of the stock at the end and, in that pre-blender era, put them through a Foley Food Mill. She was 4 foot 10 and her pots were BIG. She had to stand on a stool to hand grind those vegetables back into the soup, making the stock richer—with a little more texture, a little something something. And she was not afraid to season! She tasted as she went, layering flavor all along the way. She was famous for saying, “If it tastes good, it is. If it doesn’t, it’s not!” She was right. ♥ + 2. Learn how great soup is born. \nIt will help elevate your soup-making skills from good to great if you deconstruct soup to see how it works. All soups have some common elements: Advertisement Fats , such as olive oil, ghee, coconut oil Aromatics , such as onions, carrots, celery, fennel Dried herbs and spices , such as cumin, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic Deglazing liquids , like ½ cup of broth, wine, tamari Main ingredients , not limited to vegetables, legumes, meat Broth or stock Finishers , including salt, acid, fresh herbs, garnishes \nOnce you recognize the role each ingredient plays in a soup, you’re on your way to freeing up your creativity. You’ll soon see a recipe as a guideline instead of something that must be strictly followed to the letter. 3. Understand the process, step-by-step. \nOnce you understand why you do what you do at every step of recipe making, you’ll understand how to utilize the essential ingredients to make a great soup. Heat your pan before adding the fat. Add aromatics with a pinch of salt. Let the onions dance for a short while to sweeten them. Cook until they’re translucent and slightly caramelized. Add dried herbs (if using) and spices. Sauté for just a minute, so they combine into your base and get coated in fat. Deglaze the pan with half a cup of broth or another liquid. Let the liquid simmer until it reduces by half so the flavor is concentrated. (I get so excited about this, I can smell the aromas as I write!) Now you’re home free. Add the main ingredients, the vegetables, the legumes, the meat, and stir to coat with the seasonings. Everybody is mingling! The chorus line is mingling with the stars. All the characters are on stage. Add your broth. Bring it to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until all the ingredients are soft enough to puree or cooked to desired tenderness.
