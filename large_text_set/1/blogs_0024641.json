Energy companies, big retailers and other major business interests oppose such an import tax, arguing that it would drive up prices in the United States, curb demand, and erode profits. \nOn its face, that doesn't appear to fulfill President Donald Trump's oft-repeated vow to force Mexico to pay for the barrier, which Mexican leaders have made clear they don't want and certainly won't agree to pay for. \nIf anything, it's a tacit admission that the Trump administration can't cajole or coerce Mexico into paying for the project, at least in the near term. \nTexas imported $84 billion from Mexico in 2015 . With a 20 percent tariff, Texas businesses and consumers would have paid an extra $16.8 billion for the same goods and services. \nMexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner. The White House described the idea as a tax on all imports from Mexico — $271 billion nationally last year. That would generate $54.2 billion in revenue, though a tariff that high would drastically suppress trade in both directions, and have other repercussions. \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the idea with reporters aboard Air Force One as the president returned from a speech to GOP lawmakers in Philadelphia. He later downplayed it as merely one of many possible revenue sources. \n\"When you look at the plan that's taking shape now, using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico,\" Spicer said on Air Force One. \"If you tax that $50 billion at 20 percent of imports... we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. That's really going to provide the funding.\" \nSpicer seemed to be conflating the overall import level ($271 billion) with the much smaller trade deficit, which refers to the gap between the value of exports and imports between two countries. \nA tariff of the sort described, he said, \"clearly provides the funding and does so in a way that the American taxpayer is wholly respected.\" \nThat's open to dispute, given that U.S. buyers would pay the import tax. \n\"The notion that a Mexican tariff of 20 percent represents the Mexicans paying for the wall is a flawed understanding of how tariffs work,\" said David French, a senior vice president at the National Retail Federation. \"That would be a huge increase on prices paid by U.S. consumers.\" \nAlfredo Duarte, president and co-founder of Dallas-based Taxco Produce Inc., said the proposed import tax will hurt American consumers more than anyone - especially anyone with a year-round appetite for tomatoes and avocados.

(AFP/Ronaldo Schemidt/Getty Images) \n\"We don't produce any vegetables here in the states\" during the winter, he said. \"We have to import vegetables. If people are still wanting to eat guacamole on Super Bowl day, we'll just go back to the time when we were paying $80 a case for avocados from California about 15 years ago.\" \nTaxco distributes mostly produce and goods imported from Mexico -- including Topo Chico, Jarritos and El Tapatio -- to restaurants and stores around the region. \nToday, a case of avocados -- 30 to 60 fruit, depending on their size -- costs about $40. \nHe added that many large scale avocado and tomato growers in Mexico are owned by American companies. \nThe White House created confusion as to just how serious Trump is about imposing an import tax. Aboard Air Force One, Spicer made a forceful case for a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports, saying that \"Right now our country's policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous.\" \"It could be 18, it could be 5. ... I'm not here to roll out a policy,\" said White House press secretary Sean Spicer, backtracking from the two-hour old trial balloon. \nBut two hours later, he insisted this was one of many approaches under review. \n\"It could be 18, it could be 5.... I'm not here to roll out a policy,\" he told reporters at the White House. \"The goal is to say 'hey, here is a way you could do it.' We've been asked over and over again, 'How could you possibly do this? There's no way that Mexico will pay for it.' Here's one way. Boom. Done. We could go in another direction.\" \nAlso unclear is how the push for a border wall will affect tax negotiations with Congress. Trump has long desired a tariff -- calling it a \"big border tax\" -- though he hadn't previously tied it to the wall. Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad. (2) — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017 \nThat could nod at the House GOP's much-ballyhooed tax plan, which relies upon revenue generated by so-called border adjustments. That mechanism would effectively tax imports but not exports. That makes it different from a tariff, which only affects goods flowing in one direction. \nRep. Kevin Brady, the Texan who leads the House's tax writing panel, has led the charge for border adjustments as a way to level playing field\" for U.S. manufacturers. \nOn Thursday, he distanced himself from any effort to single out Mexico, and said the message Trump offered GOP lawmakers sounded much broader, and closer to the House GOP approach, than what Spicer later laid out. \n\"I don't think they were singling out one country over another,\" Brady told Fox News. \"Our tax proposal clearly doesn't do that.\" \nRetailers, refiners and other business groups say that Brady's approach threatens higher costs. \nTrump himself has scoffed at border adjustment taxes as \"too complicated,\" and telling The Wall Street Journal earlier this month that \"usually it means we're going to get adjusted into a bad deal.\" Days later he softened his stance, telling Axios that the mechanism is \"certainly something that is going to be discussed.\" \nHis latest gambit prompted critics to pounce. \n\"Trump is taking a shot at our jobs,\" warned Texas Democratic Party executive director Crystal Perkins. \"Texas' working families and our economy depend on a strong relationship with Mexico. Minority President Donald Trump's 20-percent tax will kill Texas jobs, raise the price of goods for Texas families, and slaughter Texas' relationship with its largest trading partner.\" Tax mexican imports = start a trade war =harm Mex. economy = illegal immigration goes UP #econ101 #imnotaneconomistbut #lordhelpus — Celia Israel (@CeliaIsrael) January 26, 2017 \nBy the time the White House promoted the import tax, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto had already canceled a trip to Washington next week to meet with his new U.S. counterpart. He expressed dismay at Trump's announcement a day earlier that he will, in fact, push to construct a wall the length of the U.S.-Mexico border, and reiterating his insistence that Mexico will eventually pay for that wall. \nIn Philadelphia, Trump spun the cancellation as a mutual decision and reiterated his expectation for reimbursement. The wall is likely to cost $10 billion to $25 billion. \n\"Unless Mexico is going to treat the U.S. fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless,\" Trump said. \nSpicer said the president has discussed the proposal with GOP lawmakers. \nSuch a tariff would require congressional action -- and would likely lead to retaliatory tariffs and other pushback from Mexico. \nU.S.-Mexico relations have hit a low point, after years of warming that included increased cooperation to smooth border trade, curb the flow of migrants, weapons and drugs, and share intelligence involving terrorists. \nAt various times, he has floated the idea of pressuring Mexico by renegotiating or scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement, or by cutting off \"remittances\" - payments sent from U.S. residents to relatives in Mexico. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Austin, suggested such \"creative\" tactics as collecting a security fee for border-crossers. \n\"There will be a payment,\" Trump told ABC News on Wednesday. \"It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form.\" \nSpicer rejected the idea that U.S. consumers would bear the brunt of an import tax. \n\"I think what it's going to do is lift up the wages of American workers,\" he said. \"Right now we have an influx of cheap labor. Its going to put the American consumer back, net net, to make sure the American workers get lifted up, as well.\" \nStaff writer Jill Cowan in Dallas contributed reporting.
