How Parliament is policed: By the BBC's Jack Evans Image copyright AFP \nThere are two Metropolitan Police officers manning Carriage Gates at all times. \nBehind the gates there is a hut staffed by a third officer, whose job is to monitor pedestrians exiting the estate. \nAll three officers are issued with stab vests. \nThey check to ensure the driver of a vehicle or bicycle has the correct parliamentary pass. Cars are security vetted beyond the gates. They all have two way radios so can call for help in emergencies. \nArmed police are on patrol throughout the Parliamentary estate at all times but they are more visible at times of heightened security. \nSecurity expert Professor Anthony Glees said the attack had demonstrated a \"lack of protection\" within Parliament. \n\"I am very disturbed by the complacent attitude,\" Prof Glees, who heads the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies programme at the University of Buckingham told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. \n\"The fact is in immediate terms and wider terms, this was a failure of security policy. \n\"This is someone who got within 100 metres of where the prime minister was. If he had an explosive vest, we would be having a very different conversation.\" 'No panacea' \nTony Long, a former armed police officer, said those stationed at College Gates were effectively \"meeters and greeters and pass checkers\" who were well known to MPs. \nHe told Victoria Derbyshire there had been a huge reluctance within Parliament, which oversees its own security, to have armed officers on patrol. \n\"There is a huge amount of tradition about that building,\" he said. Media caption Moment PM evacuated from Westminster \n\"I guarantee if those gates were shut, the first person to complain about it would be an MP or a cabinet minister.\" \nSeveral MPs have warned Westminster should not be turned into a fortress. \n\"The idea that arming all police will be a panacea and a solution to this problem may well be mistaken,\" said Conservative MP Dominic Grieve. \n\"It is worth bearing in mind that in fact security wasn't breached. There was a tragic loss of life but in trying to breach security, he was stopped.\" \nKim Howells, a former chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said one must remember Parliament is a \"working building with people moving in and out\". \nAsked why Masood had not been stopped from entering the parliamentary estate, he said: \"This guy ran in through the gates. As a former rugby man, I know it is not easy to bring down a man in such a situation.\" \nThere was a major review of security at the Palace of Westminster in 2014 which was supposed to \"assess the strengths and weaknesses of the current arrangements and to make recommendations\".
