referees, draw Staff writers and AAP, FOX SPORTS March 15, 2017 2:26pm \nRISING star Damian McKenzie will start at No 10 for the Chiefs against the Rebels as part of widespread changes from coach Dave Rennie. \nKeep checking in for all the latest Super Rugby team news. \nCRUSADERS v BLUES in Christchurch, Friday 5.35pm AEDT \nBLUES five-eighth Ihaia West has been dumped from the starting XV for his Super Rugby side’s clash with the Crusaders. \nThe 25-year-old playmaker had a night to forget against the Highlanders on Saturday, turning over the ball three times as the Blues dourly lost 16-12. \nIn his place will step Piers Francis, who Blues boss Tana Umaga felt had injected much-needed offensive thrust off the bench last week. \n“We believe Ihaia has the skills, it’s just making sure there’s that performance, what you put out there on the track,” Umaga told reporters. \n“Piers gets an opportunity now to do the same thing and he’s going to be in the middle of the cauldron.” media_camera Piers Francis of the Blues is tackled by Aaron Cruden of the Chiefs. \nElsewhere, Umaga has switched up his loose forward trio for the battle in Canterbury, with Test flanker Jerome Kaino to play at No 8. \nJimmy Tupou will switch from lock to Kaino’s blindside role, while Gerard Cowley-Tuioti slots back into the second row next to Patrick Tuipulotu. \nUmaga said the changes were made to nullify the Crusaders’ fearsome set-piece ability, particularly with all-Test locking duo Sam Whitelock and Scott Barrett. \n“We’ve got to try and match that and obviously ours isn’t going too well, so we want to give ourselves more options,” Umaga said. \n“We just want to add some more height, it’s nothing against what Murphy (Taramai) did, we thought he worked his butt off.” \nIn the backline, Melani Nanai returns to the left edge in place of Rene Ranger, who has dropped out of the matchday squad entirely. \nThe former All Black struggled on the wing against the Highlanders and would be redeployed in midfield if George Moala or Rieko Ioane become unavailable. \nFormer New Zealand under-20s midfield back TJ Faiane has been named on the bench after overcoming several long-term injuries and will likely make his debut. \n“Bringing (Rene) off the bench probably wouldn’t serve us, we’ve got an opportunity for him to play 80 minutes in the development game,” Umaga said. \n“We want to see the best of him.” \nCRUSADERS (TBC): \nBLUES (15-1): Michael Collins, Matt Duffie, Rieko Ioane, George Moala, Melani Nanai, Piers Francis, Augustine Pulu, Jerome Kaino, Blake Gibson, Jimmy Tupou, Patrick Tuipulotu, Gerard Cowley-Tuioti, Ofa Tu’ungafasi, James Parsons (c), Pauliasi Manu \nReserves: Matt Moulds, Sam Prattley, Sione Mafileo, Akira Ioane, Murphy Taramai, Billy Guyton, Ihaia West, TJ Faiane \nReferee: Brendon Pickerill (NZ) Hodge a shining light in 2017 5:06 \nRugby: Reece Hodge has been a shining light in 2017 and he reveals what his secrets are behind his good form.
