There were tons of ideas on how we are going to use this website from your guys. Someone said it will be paid service (the wrong guess, it's still free), then we heard that GBT.com will be abandoned (wrong again, we constantly update UX and UI there, as well as improve functionality). Anyhow, GBT.com is fine and more than that, we took the best from it to implement on UG. \nHere is the feature I'm talking about - backing tracks for the most popular songs right on a tab page: \nHere are some cool features: Backing tracks are available for about 8,000 songs About 10 new backing tracks are added daily You can loop a specific section of a track Hotkeys are available (hover the Play and Loop buttons to get them) Volume control is a thing as well \nWhat are backing tracks and why are they cool? \nIt's basically a recording of a certain song without a guitar part(s) mostly used to practice. \nIn other words, it's like karaoke for a guitar. So you can play your guitar part along with a backing track and it will sound like a whole band even with vocalist (in some cases). \nSo, try these tabs with the backing tracks and let us know how do you like it and what would you like to change or improve:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:42:01.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
