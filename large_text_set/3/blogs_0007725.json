Authorities said he picked up the woman Saturday night on Linkhorn Bay in Virginia Beach, according to an incident report from the Virginia Beach Police Department.\nCourt records did not provide details about the incident.\n[ Uber used secret tool, extraordinary measures to sidestep government officials ]\nYoro, who had no prior criminal history, had been driving part-time for Uber for two to three years, according to court documents cited by the Virginian-Pilot .\nAn Uber spokesman said in a statement to The Washington Post that the 34-year-old driver has been banned from Uber and that the company is working with authorities during their investigation.\n“The type of conduct that has been described has no place on the app or anywhere,” the statement said.\nUber, a popular ride-hailing service, has recently come under fire for a series of controversies. Last month, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler Rigetti wrote in a blog post that she and other women in the company had been discriminated against and sexually harassed at work. After she started working there, she said, her manager told her he was in an “open relationship” and hit on her — and when she reported it to the human resources department, she was told it was his first offense and was advised to let it go.\nRigetti later learned that other women had reported the same manager for inappropriate behavior, she said.\n“It was such a blatant lie that there was really nothing I could do,” she wrote about the department’s claims. “There was nothing any of us could do. We all gave up on Uber HR and our managers after that.”\nSoon after Rigetti’s post went viral, Uber announced it had hired former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder Jr. to help lead an investigation into claims of sexual harassment and discrimination.\nAdding to Uber’s tension, tech news website Recode reported last week that Uber Vice President of Product and Growth Ed Baker said he was resigning, writing in an email, “I have always wanted to apply my experience in technology and growth to the public sector. And now seems like the right moment to get involved.”\nFurthermore, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick was recently captured on video shouting at an Uber driver over pay rates.\nThen the New York Times reported that the company had been using software to evade government regulators.\nAccording to The Switch :\nUber used a tool, code-named Greyball, in 2014 to identify Portland, Ore., officials who posed as regular customers to request rides to gather evidence that the company was operating illegally in the city, according to the Times report. But rather than procuring a driver for the “customer,” the service showed officials fake versions of the Uber app, complete with fake drivers. Any real ones who did respond to the requests for rides would quickly cancel, sometimes after direct intervention from Uber officials to drivers, allowing the service to avoid detection in a city where it was banned.\n“This is a really bad month. The number and kind of problems they have is an unusual array of bad luck and bad behavior combined,” said Paul Argenti, a professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business. Though he and other experts suggested that the company could recover its momentum with better management, he said that “ultimately, your reputation is a complex thing. … There has to be a lot of bad stuff going on for this to make a difference. I still think they’re not there.”\nFollowing the sexual assault case, the Associated Press reported that although drivers are usually required to undergo background checks, Uber has been resisting more extensive measures such as fingerprinting.\nYoro, the accused driver, is set to be back in court in May. It was not clear whether Yoro has an attorney in the case.\nRead more:\n[ Md. approves alternative screening process for ride-hailing drivers, amid threats Uber would leave ]\n[ The Koran-burning preacher has been driving for Uber ]\n[ Why is my Lyft driver breathing into an ignition interlock device? ]", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTEDYCkNqns?feature=oembed", "http://www.recode.net/2017/3/3/14805384/uber-ed-baker-resigns-travis-kalanick", "https://twitter.com/@lindseybever", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html", "http://pilotonline.com/news/local/crime/uber-driver-charged-with-raping-passenger-in-virginia-beach/article_1e5017ff-ce21-5ea6-b725-c38bd3c1c2bf.html", "https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber"], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:38:01.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
