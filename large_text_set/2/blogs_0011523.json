These responders are monitored closely by shipboard air defense officers to protect their ship and identify hostile and friendly aircraft via radar. \nThis is becoming dangerous. Russia is starting to act out like a child throwing a temper tantrum, and we cannot let them play around because it could end up in unnecessary danger to American forces. \nWe will stay on top of these developing incidents. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and be sure to add your thoughts to the comment section below.
