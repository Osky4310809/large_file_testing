Given its popularity, the badass cosmetics purveyor recently announced she would be adding a blotting powder compact to the Lock-It range.\nOn Instagram, Kat shared a picture of the compact , which features the brand's signature wax seal. Unfortunately, the compact is closed in the picture so we can't say much about its contents. We can assume, however, that the blotting powder compact will serve as a tidier and more portable alternative to the Lock-It Setting Powder .\nWax-seal inspired compact I designed for the new @katvondbeauty Lock-It blotting powder. üñ§ #comingsoon #lockit\nA post shared by Kat Von D (@thekatvond) on Mar 21, 2017 at 2:52pm PDT\nIn addition to the compact, Kat's picture included an amazing handheld mirror with the same aforementioned seal. After initially explaining she had the mirror made to celebrate the upcoming launch of the compact, Kat added, \"If I get these handheld mirrors made, would you guys want them?\" As you might expect, people were pretty stoked on the mirror, as most comments on the picture included a stream of exclamation points and heart eyes emoji.
