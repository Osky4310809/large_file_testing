Linden Dovey picks the ball up on the halfway line (Photo: YouTube/Hereford FC) The captain evades five defenders (Photo: YouTube/Hereford FC) \nIn the video, the centre-back - yes you did hear that right, centre-back - picks the ball up on the half-way line. \nHe then proceeds to run through the middle of the pitch and evade challenges from no less than FIVE Hereford United players. \nAdmittedly not all five defenders come close enough to try to dispossess Dovey, but they do at the very least attempt to block him off/throw him off course. The skipper hits the back of the net with a long-range shot (Photo: YouTube/Hereford FC) Not quite as glamorous as the Southern League Division One South and West (Photo: Alex Caparros) \nBut really, they shouldn't have even bothered because after going around them like cones, the centre-back smashes a shot at goal from just outside the area. \nAnd of course, hits the back of the net. \nUnbelievable stuff. It's just a shame the goal couldn't instigate a comeback for his side, who went on to lose the game 2-1.
