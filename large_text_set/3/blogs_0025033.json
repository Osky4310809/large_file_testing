And that inspiration came from a lot of early artists, bands like Faith No More, RATM and RHCP. \n\"A big influence and a band that really created a lot of drive for us was the band Mr. Bungle, who a lot of people still don't know. But that was in the beginning of the inception of the band Korn, really. \n\"And that sort of inspiration from all those bands, like Sepultura and other bands that I mentioned, that really drove us to wanna become something unique like those bands and find something that really connected, 'cause those bands connected with us.\" \nNamed after a 1950s children's educational film, Mr. Bungle was founded in 1985 by a group of high-school friends. One of them was Mike Patton, who later scored major musical success as the voice of Faith No More. \nThey've released three albums over the years and officially called it quits in 2000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:51:37.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
