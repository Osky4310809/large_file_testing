She has a personal hatred for me which supersedes anything,” he said. “She needs to wind her neck in and concentrate on the real problems in her constituency rather than trying to close down my club, which makes a real contribution to the local community.” Adam Walker (left) and Nick Griffin leaving the General Teaching Council in Birmingham, 2010, after Walker was cleared of racial intolerance.

When I teach these children it has got nothing to do with the BNP. It is a totally different hat that I wear.” \nWhen asked about the case, the DCMS said the government was “completely committed to doing all it can to ensure people can participate in sport in safe and secure environments”. \nA spokesman said that in November the sport minister, Tracey Crouch, had written to national sporting governing bodies to “look at their own safeguarding practices to make sure they are as robust as possible and that work is ongoing”. \nWalker resigned from his teaching post at Houghton Kepier college in Sunderland in 2007 after it was revealed he had used a school laptop during lessons to post descriptions of immigrants as “savage animals” and “filth”. \nIn 2010, he appeared in front of the General Teaching Council and was found guilty of misconduct for the use of the laptop and given a conditional restriction order, but he was cleared of the charge of racial intolerance . This restriction was increased to a lifetime ban by Gove in 2014. \nAt the time, Walker said he had never “discriminated against an individual on grounds of race, faith or sexuality”, and said part of the reason he became a teacher was to “help people overcome social disadvantage and reach their full potential”. \nFollowing the incident with the three schoolboys in 2011, Walker was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment suspended for 18 months, after he admitted dangerous driving, a public order offence and possessing a bladed instrument. \nIn April 2010, he was investigated by the Metropolitan police for wearing armed forces fatigues whilst campaigning with the then BNP leader, Nick Griffin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T11:32:57.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
