Spend a little more and opt for cashmere or camel hair (yes, from the actual animal) over wool if you know you’ll be wearing yours to the office. \nWe like this cashmere-camel mix from Brooks Brothers as an attainable investment piece ($498, brooksbrothers.com ). Just make sure to get it tailored to give you that Superman “V” chest. Meet In the Middle A photo posted by EJ Samson (@ejsamson) on Nov 6, 2016 at 12:59pm PST \nUnexpected combinations—like this Chicago sweatshirt with the camel coat—breathe new life into the classic. They also show that you know how to layer like pro . \nPair yours with fitted chinos and sneakers (like Ralph Lauren’s EJ Sampson did here) for an off-duty look that you wouldn’t be afraid to meet your boss in. Go Full Casual A photo posted by Todd Snyder (@toddsnyderny) on Nov 27, 2016 at 7:17am PST \nUnlike black or navy, a camel double-breasted coat is casual enough to look totally at home on top of athleisure . This Todd Snyder look works well because the fabric of the sweats and sweatshirt flow into the wool coat. Polyester basketball shorts? Not so much. \nPop the collar for added umph and warmth, then live comfortably forever knowing you’ll never fall out of trend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:39:44.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
