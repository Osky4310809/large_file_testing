Like, ever. No one wants this on camera. It’s fine. \nThe “Keeping Up With The Kardashians” star posted a selfie in a beige tank, and the surgery rumors (that perhaps never fully died down) kicked right back up. Instagram \nLast year, fans online speculated whether Kylie had gotten breast implants. \nShe told followers, \nNo, people — I haven’t gotten breast implants! Everyone is obsessed with that.

Giphy \nIf you want to carve off your nose bones and shove a bunch of plastic in your titty holes, DO IT. Then, tell the world. Be proud. \nI once went to Disney World with my Grandma for a week when I was five and unabashedly went toothbrush-free for the whole seven days. \nI came back to New Jersey looking like I was born in a sewer and feeling so liberated with my green teeth and fuck-all attitude because at the end of the day, you have to live for yourself. \nYou also have to practice proper oral hygiene, but, like, you get it.
