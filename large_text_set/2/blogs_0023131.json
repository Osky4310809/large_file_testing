So after seeing Jordan Peele ’s excellent Get Out f or himself, he wanted to make sure everyone else in Chicago had a chance to do so as well. And for free. \n(Read: Horror and Race: How Jordan Peele’s Get Out Flips the Script ) \nEarly in the day, Chance Tweeted out his appreciation for the horror/comedy, saying, “DID I NOT TELL YALL #GETOUT WAS INCREDIBLE!! BEST FILM ACROSS ANY GENRE IN AWHILE GO SEE IT TODAY!” Then he went ahead and made it easy for people to do just that by buying every ticket to every screening of the movie all day at a theater on Chicago’s South Side. Fans simply had to show up with an ID proving their age and they were granted a free ticket to the film. DID I NOT TELL YALL #GETOUT WAS INCREDIBLE!!
