Pic: Darren England. \nLynn’s exit — along with that of all-rounder Mitchell Marsh who will miss the rest of the Pakistan series with a shoulder injury — opens the door for Handscomb to slot into the crucial No.4 batting role. \nLehmann is hopeful Lynn will return for the home T20 series against Sri Lanka, starting on February 17. \n“He’s been playing through a lot of pain even during the BBL and he’s got to the stage where he can’t function anymore,” coach Darren Lehmann said in Perth. \n“He’ll have a couple of weeks of no cricket ... he’s got to calm down the neck because it’s quite aggravated. \n“He’ll start his rehab now and he won’t be doing too much strenuous stuff before he hopefully gets back for the Sri Lankan series.” media_camera Peter Handscomb had an instant impact in Test cricket. \nHandscomb made an immediate impact during the Test summer, averaging an extraordinary 99.75 through his first four Tests as he notched two centuries and two half-centuries. \n“He’s done really well, he’s been outstanding. it’s good reward for a good summer,” Lehmann said of Handscomb. \n“Obviously we want four quality batters going at the top. He’ll get his chance there. \n“It’s unlucky for Chris Lynn (but) that number four spot is there and Peter has done a really good job in the Test match for us, so he gets another crack at it.” \nAlthough not renowned for being a blaster, Handscomb showcased his one- day potential with an unbeaten 40 off 25 balls during Australia’s pursuit of quick runs in their SCG Test win over Pakistan. \n“He played a very good one-day sort of innings for us in the Sydney Test match where we scored quite quickly,” Lehmann said. \n“So he’s got all the shots and he’s quite innovative. \n“He’s done outstanding. It’s good reward for a good summer.” \nStanlake made his ODI debut in the series-opening win at the Gabba. But a bout of illness meant he could only bowl three overs before he was forced from the field. \nLehmann has high hopes for what the 204cm paceman can achieve at the WACA Ground. \n“He’s tall and he’s got some bounce, so we think he will be quite effective here,” Lehmann said. \nSpinner Adam Zampa and allrounder Marcus Stoinis were the unlucky players to miss out on a spot in the XI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T06:54:07.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
