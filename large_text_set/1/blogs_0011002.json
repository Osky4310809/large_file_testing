London train stations (not tube stations) all have toilets but they're not usually free.The following public toilets have been chosen for their proximity to major London attractions. (Remember, all museums and galleries have free loos too.) London Eye. Â© Laura Porter 1. Near London Eye \nThe London Eye Ticket Hall is in County Hall and there are free toilets downstairs. I didn't find them particularly clean last time I was there but they do have those fun Dyson hand dryers . I've always found the disabled toilets on the ground floor to be pretty clean.A few steps further along the South Bank brings you to Southbank Centre. Head into the Royal Festival Hall as there are loads of toilets in there and they are always clean. There's also a great cafe and bar in there, as well as a number of the restaurants outside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:30:21.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
