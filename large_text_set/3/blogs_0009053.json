My words are in bold,” Emma wrote on Twitter along with an excerpt from the interview.\nThe full quotes from the article reveal that Emma really did think that Lemonade had some great feminist qualities.\nClick inside to read what Emma Watson said in the full interview… \n“The fact that she wasn’t doing it for a label, she was doing it for herself and the control that she has directing it and putting it out there, I agree is making her sexuality empowering because it is her choice,” Emma said in a quote that has been left out of the conversation. She adds, “I would say you do get sense of, ‘I can be a feminist, I can be an intellectual, I can be all these other thing,s but I can also be ok with my femininity and being pretty and with all these things that I thought might negate my message or negate what I’m about.’ That really is the most interesting thing about the album. It is so inclusive and puts feminism and femininity and female empowerment on such a broad spectrum.”\nThis is the part of my 2014 interview with Tavi where we talked about Beyoncé.
