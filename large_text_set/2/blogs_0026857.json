And all it took was a single, misplaced envelope.\nAs the shock and pandemonium of seeing the night's biggest moment blow up in such a spectacular fashion began to wear off, people looked around for someone to blame.

Follow @briancullinan_ & @MarthaLTRuiz pic.twitter.com/i06ZuAKgiZ\n— PwC (@PwC) February 24, 2017\nBy Monday morning, PwC was having perhaps its biggest turn in the public spotlight ever—a moment that likely surpassed much more consequential controversies like its role in the financial crisis and a string of rule-breaking settlements in the early 2000s in terms of media attention. Usually subject only to some annual passing intrigue over its secret-keeping customs, the firm now took center stage before an audience of millions.\nIt's often said that there's no such thing as bad press, but when it comes to a firm that individual and institutional clients expect to meticulously catalog their finances, botching a simple envelope hand-off might qualify , here.\nPwC is one of the biggest and best accounting firms in the world. It's one of only a handful of big companies widely recognized as a longtime, undisputed leader of their industry. The Oscars debacle, as cringeworthy as it was, doesn't really change that.\nYet as taxpayers look for a name they can trust to adeptly handle their IRS bills this April, an association with such a high-profile meltdown doesn't look good, even if it does get the firm's name in the minds of millions of people who might otherwise never have thought twice about it.\nIn any case, it's doubtful that the accounting firm will ever again be able to credibly bill itself as the esteemed keeper of some sacred Hollywood custom. While previous years' shows have seen a few similar accidents, there has never been one of such epic proportion, and no one's likely to forget should the firm make its usual pre-Oscars press round in years to come.\nA scene from 'Bojack Horseman' plays on the aura of mystery PwC has built around its Oscars job.\nImage: netflix still\nIn fact, there's even some speculation that the firm's long-running partnership with The Academy might be in jeopardy too. Speaking to the New York Times on Monday, brand image expert Andrew Gilman, CEO of crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group, told the paper that the firm's reputation will likely take a major dent:\n“I’m sure there will be a logical explanation for what happened, but they’re going to be the butt of jokes for late-night TV for at least a week, there will be memes written, and I think it’ll be interesting to see if they hold on to their contract.”\nAs far as damage control goes, there's little the firm can do to erase the incident from public memory beyond apologizing. As of Monday morning, the brand's Twitter account was already resolutely plowing forward with unrelated company news to bury the now-embarrassing Oscar promotions.\nMuch of the promotional push PwC did in the lead-up to the event already looks awfully silly in retrospect. For instance, a particularly prescient piece last week from the Huffington Post— which partnered with the accounting firm for the show—is entitled, \"What Would Happen If A Presenter Announced The Wrong Winner At The Oscars?\" (Naturally, that post has already fueled a few #OscarsTruthers.)\nPerhaps the best outcome PwC can hope for brand-wise is a surge of pitying goodwill from people who think the haters are being too hard on it.\n@PwC_LLP We've become a country of people who feel human error is unacceptable. This is not a big deal, no one died...except for a few egos.\n— Carla (@TrueJustice0157) February 27, 2017\n@amancaytapia @PwC_LLP Jesus, they've just apologised, what else do you want them to do?
