As revealed through social media earlier today, Rich The Kid and Kendrick Lamar have been cooking up some music together. Via an Instagram post from Rich The Kid himself and some brief clips floating around Twitter, the pair's in-studio encounter was confirmed and pushed as \"legendary.\" While only a snippet of Rich The Kid's bars have surfaced, rest assured that Kendrick Lamar will come with some heat. If these two are working together, maybe we'll get a Migos record with another member of the TDE family.
