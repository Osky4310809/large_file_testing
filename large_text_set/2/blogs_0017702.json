But, if the health sector that is supposed to provide health care services to the masses is unstable, then the nation is unhealthy.’’ \n“The Union expects that a circular directing payment of these arrears be issued to the institutions concerned since the financial implications had been done by the government. We demand that payment be initiated without further delay,” Ogbonna stated. \nUrging for adjustment on the CONHESS salary structure, he stated that the CONMESS salary structure for medical practitioners had been reviewed since January 3, 2014 and all its arrears paid. \nHe said stagnation which had been referred to as promotion, appointment of consultants and payment of specialist allowance and Enhanced Entry Point (EEP) for medical laboratory scientists and radiographers should be addressed. \n“We condemn preferential treatment in the health sector and the practice of appointing university staff to head departments and units of the hospital whereas; there are qualified and competent hospital-based healthcare professionals. \n“It should cease, since it is contrary to the provisions of our various schemes of service, regulatory councils provision and the Onosode 1981 white paper on presidential commission on parastatals. \n“The most senior hospital-based health care professional should be appointed to head the department and not the part time staff from the associated universities. Retirement age should be adjusted from 60 years to 65 years. \n“We have also observed that pensioners are not being treated well and this must stop; pension arrears should be paid and retirees paid promptly,’’ he said.
