Whether this will be in the form of a traditional Virtual Console section for GameCube games, or with remastered versions of the system’s greatest titles, is anybody’s guess. \nIn the meantime, we’ll be quietly hoping that such GameCube classics as F-Zero GX, Viewtiful Joe, Eternal Darkness, Wave Race: Blue Storm and Super Mario Sunshine will make their way to the Switch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:41:41.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
