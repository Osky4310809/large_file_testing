King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 3 hours ago 15 \nCorey Taylor addressed Metallica's Grammys performance, saying that metal giants did not deserve to be \"disrespected like that.\" \nHe said on the ETC Show : \"I feel bad for Metallica. At this point in their career, they shouldn't have been disrespected like that. The fact that they shut the off - Metallica doesn't have control of that. \n\"The thing that people have to remember - I'm gonna give you a little background. All of Metallica's people are not allowed to work on live performances on television. None of us are. They have a sound producer and a whole crew of people who work on those shows, and then your people work right behind them. \n\"But you're not allowed to touch anything, which is horseshit, because stuff like this then happens. \n\"The fact that then they weren't introduced? It was just, 'Oh, here's Lady Gaga.' Oh, by the way, she's fucking with Metallica, you dick.\" \nSlipknot singer added: \"I have a lot of very strong opinions about the Grammys anyway, but that really cemented it for me. We don't need your respect. We don't need you to make us feel like we accomplished something, 'cause all you do is open our mouths and shit in it, and I'm tired of tastin' it. \n\"So fuck you, dude. And by the way, I've won one, so it's not a big deal. They don't even really listen to this shit. They go, 'Oh, I recognize that name. There you go.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:53:59.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
