Shaikh, who worked for the Cincinnati-based consumer goods company (NYSE: PG) for nine years, said the firm he founded recently sold the iPhone app he had pitched on “Shark Tank.” Kash Shaikh, a former Procter & Gamble marketing manager who is founder and CEO of… more ABC Television/Michael Desmond Besomebody Inc., which developed what Shaikh claims is the world’s first mobile platform that results in learning experiences by connecting people based on shared passions, sold its app-anchored Experiences Marketplace to Utivity Holdings Inc. for an undisclosed amount. The app, which can be downloaded for free from the App Store, is designed to help people who might want to learn more about athletic pursuits, art, entrepreneurship, cooking, karate or whatever else interests them from those who are already knowledgeable. Those who receive instruction meet in person with tutors for hands-on learning, perhaps in hopes of pursuing a career in that field. The instructors, called “passionaries,” get paid to teach what they love, and Besomebody had been getting 20 percent of each transaction. Shaikh, who still owns a townhouse near Eden Park but rents it out, said the Besomebody brand arose from his work at P&G. As he rose to be senior manager for social marketing and communications in developing markets for P&G’s $9 billion Fabric Care business, Shaikh traveled to countries on five continents. Along the way, he met people who inspired him to write social media and blog posts about his experiences. Shaikh began using the motivational hashtag #besomebody in 2009, and he created the #besomebody blog in 2011. To finance Besomebody Inc, he cashed out his 401(k) from P&G. The #besomebody app was beta tested in Shaikh’s native Texas in 2015, and his company began to scale it nationally last year. Shaikh sought additional investment for the app from the ABC-TV show’s venture capitalists, who are called sharks, during a segment taped in June. The show aired Nov. 4, and Shaikh appeared to be caught in a “Shark Tank” feeding frenzy. Mark Cuban , the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, was especially critical of Shaikh and his brand . But Shaikh said his Boston-based firm, which landed $1 million in seed money from Cincinnati-based E.W. Scripps in 2014, said “Shark Tank” provided national exposure that led to the sale of the app. “That’s how they really learned about us,” Shaikh said of Utivity Holdings. “They had seen some (Besomebody) content online beforehand, one of our viral videos a while back, but didn’t know of our full app until the show. One of their investors and founders saw us on ‘Shark Tank.’” Besomebody will retain its branding, trademarks and community assets while transitioning its experience hosting and booking strategies, services and data to Utivity. Denver-based Utivity, an outdoor adventure platform with an established activity and experiences segment, will gain access to Besomebody’s large user and provider base across Texas, California and New England as well as what Shaikh described as a substantial international footprint. “We couldn’t be more excited to join forces with Besomebody to help people discover unique experiences and make money doing what they love,” said Kyle Granowski , Utivity’s CEO and co-founder. “The Besomebody team has done an incredible job building a huge community of people who want to get out and do more,” Granowski said. “We’ve had our eyes on them for a while, and the timing was finally right to make something happen.” Shaikh’s firm is now working on vocational training programs under the brand extension Besomebody Learning Paths, which will be taught by industry professionals. Candidates will participate in person to learn skills required for careers in fields such as wellness, health care, hospitality, animal care, automotive and energy/environment. The curriculum is created with hiring employers, ensuring that candidates learn what is necessary to do well on the job. Candidates who meet performance requirements are guaranteed a job with the endorsing employer, Shaikh said. Besomebody plans to pilot Learning Paths in Cincinnati as well as other cities in the Midwest, Northeast and Texas, Shaikh said. “There are two crises colliding right now,” Shaikh said. “The student debt crisis and the skilled worker crisis. College is more expensive than ever and job placement rates for college graduates continue to decline. On the other hand, a lot of companies have a lot of open jobs but can’t find people with the right skills to fill them. “With millions of people jobless, in debt or both, we are passionate about building a solution,” Shaikh said. “We have spent the last three years bringing people together for learning and skills training, and now we can’t wait to leverage that expertise to help get Americans back to work.” Brunsman covers Procter & Gamble Co. and health care.
