He probably meant the new plant actually being built in Guanajuato, Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nWe briefly touched on President-elect Trump’s Toyota tweet earlier today while expressing concerns over his willingness to interfere with the free market system, wielding his not-yet-official power to have major effects on, specifically, the automotive industry. \n\nThe factual issue with the tweet in question is that, while Toyota does have an existing plant in Baja, Mexico, the new plant it began constructing in November for future Corolla production is actually located in Guanajuato, Mexico, as The Guardian pointed out . \nAdvertisement \n\nWhen Toyota announced the new $1 billion Corolla plant in April of 2015, it guaranteed that no existing U.S. manufacturing jobs would be effected. It also mentioned the location of the plant in Guanajuato, which is located in Mexico’s Bajío region . \nBefore being directly confronted by the President-elect today, Toyota President Akio Toyoda said the company would wait until after Trump’s inauguration on January 20th to make any decisions. After the tweet, a spokesperson said the automaker was looking forward to “collaborating with the Trump administration to serve in the best interests of consumers and the automotive industry,” via Reuters .\n\nOf course this isn’t the first time the President-elect has threatened major automakers with a border tax on Twitter, with multiple attacks against Ford throughout his campaign and the election process, as well as General Motors two days ago where he wasn’t entirely correct either.\n\nDonald Trump Threatens GM With 'Big Border Tax' In Half-Wrong Tweet Donald Trump Threatens GM With &apos;Big Border Tax&apos; In Half-Wrong Tweet Donald Trump Threatens GM With &apos;Big Border Tax&apos;… Some people say the media should only cover what President-elect Donald Trump does, not what he… Read more Read more \nHis tweets may be having an effect, as Ford has now reversed plans to shift its small car production to Mexico, cancelling a $1.6 billion Mexico plant for a $700 million investment in Michigan for its electric vehicle development. Ford CEO Mark Fields stressed in an interview with CNN that the decision was independent from Trump’s attacks on his company. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T03:30:02.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
