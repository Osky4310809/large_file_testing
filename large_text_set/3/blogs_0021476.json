Copyright: Jonathan Roland https://www.flickr.com/photos/110671496@N06/30953338733 \nDuring his daily briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that President Trump uses his time on the golf course productively. \nSpicer’s comments came in response to a question from Yahoo News noting that Trump has visited the golf course at least 10 times since taking office eight weeks ago, even though for years he criticized former President Barack Obama for golfing. Most of Trump’s time on the links has been spent at the courses he owns in Florida, including a trip last weekend. \nSpicer said there were “two things” to point out in response to the question. First, he pointed out that Trump took Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for a golf weekend in Florida last month. \n“You saw him utilize this as an opportunity with Prime Minister Abe to help foster deeper relationships … in Asia and have a growing relationship that’s going to help U.S. interests,” Spicer said of Trump. “How you use the game of golf is something that he’s talked about.” \nRight. That’s one time out of 11 and we’re barely two months into this administration. And Obama also golfed with foreign leaders, including the prime ministers of both Britain and Malaysia. But that’s totally different , for magic, special, lucky reasons that he can’t quite explain. To be fair, though, Trump is white and that seems to make all the difference. \nI don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone with a shred of integrity can say such things without feeling ashamed. Oh wait, I just answered my own question: Spicer has no integrity, nor any capacity for shame. Just like his boss. \nAnd again, I don’t care if Trump goes golfing. Golf all you want. But since he was the one who made a huge deal about Obama golfing when he was campaigning, saying that he’ll be far too busy at the White House working to go golfing, I’m going to hold him to the same standard he demanded of Obama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T12:47:35.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
