[But] in the second movie, we’re going to start to see how much pain her father actually caused her, and we’re going to delve right into the relationship with her sister Gamora. I think we might even feel a tinge of sympathy towards Nebula this time, because we really start to see the emotional crack in her character,” she added. “I was just allowed to completely explore that and take it to a completely different dimension with her. I was really happy about that.” \nIn related news, The BBC spoke with her on the set of her upcoming directorial debut where she offered a tidbit for the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War , saying: \n“I’ll be making a little appearance in the next Avengers movies.” \nIt remains to be seen which other characters will be making an appearance in the film, though every character that’s still alive (and maybe even dead) could potentially make an appearance. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will debut in theaters May 5, 2017 with Avengers: Infinity War islated for release on May 4, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:45:47.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
