The car was in a tunnel on Queen’s Quay near Union station, the city’s busiest transit hub, where service was disrupted until just before noon on Thursday. \nNever thought I'd get to tweet the word \"extraction.\" But extraction now under way. pic.twitter.com/jR9FVlgfdh \n— Brad Ross (@bradTTC) February 23, 2017 \n\nRoss says the man managed to drive nearly 800 metres into the tunnel before getting stuck. He also tweeted the man “claims he was following his GPS.”\nHe allegedly fled the scene for a time, but then returned and was issued a ticket by transit enforcement officers.\nThis will take some time to clear. Far more than it took the driver to get to this point, unfortunately. They fled, for the record. pic.twitter.com/hln4S4aSHw \n— Brad Ross (@bradTTC) February 23, 2017 \n\nRoss says a specialized crane was needed to remove the vehicle from the tunnel.\nService along two major downtown streetcar routes was delayed for nearly six hours while the TTC resolved the situation.\nRelated Ossington station shut down after car crash knocks out gas line Inside the TTC's war room ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:37:51.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
