(MICHAEL REYNOLDS/European Pressphoto Agency) As he did in his interview with Right Turn on Friday , Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, showed an abysmal lack of concern on Sunday in his appearance on This Week regarding President-elect Donald Trump’s ethical conflicts and his potential, as soon as he takes the oath of office, to violate the emoluments clause. Host George Stephanopoulos asked if he had requested information regarding Trump’s emoluments problem:\nCHAFFETZ: No, that’s speculative. I mean, Donald Trump hasn’t even been sworn in yet. And so I do believe that he has set up a plan where the revenue or the profits that are coming to the hotel will be given directly to the Treasury. But I’m not going to go on this fishing expedition that they want me to, that the Democrats want me to, the president has a duty and obligation to comply with the law. But again he’s exempt from almost all of these things.\nNow, the emoluments clause, he’s going to have to look at and we’ll see how that rolls out.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, yeah, and the ranking Democrats of several different committees, 21 different committees have petitioned the speaker to request documents detailing the president-elect’s business dealings around the world to get at this question, including possible loans and investments from Russians Will you request that information?\nCHAFFETZ: No. I have no plans to do that at this point.\nWhat you need to look at is what is required by law, which I believe that Donald Trump has complied with, that is — because I have heard no complaints about this — and that is the financial disclosures that is what’s required by law, that’s Donald Trump…\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Isn’t the emoluments provision of the constitution the law of the land?\nCHAFFETZ: Yeah. It’s in the constitution. The president-elect hasn’t even been sworn in yet. So, all this flailing about how he’s done everything wrong it’s a little premature at best.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Five days from now, he will be the president of the United States. At that point, will you be requesting this information?\nCHAFFETZ: No, not necessarily. Look, I’m not just going to go on these fishing expeditions. I didn’t do that with President Obama. We didn’t go through this with President Obama. I think the world and certainly the American voters understand that Donald Trump has mass holdings. He’s worth billions of dollars. He’s been very successful in business. And I think the American voters understood that when they voted him in.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I think a lot of Democrats might disagree with your characterization of President Obama and the investigations of Hillary Clinton and her email server and of course Benghazi as well, but on this particular issue, there is another issue…\nCHAFFETZ: But those were about specific policies and actions once they were in office. I didn’t investigate Hillary Clinton before she was in office [Note: He did threaten to before she was even elected], I started investigated Hillary Clinton’s actions after the inspector-general said that there was classified information housed in a non-classified setting, that’s what…\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I took your point on that at the beginning of the investigation now, but I asked you if you were going to be looking at these issues at once president-elect is actually president of the United States.\nCHAFFETZ: If people have questions about this, the White House is going to be the one that has to answer those questions. Until we see something that is actually wrongdoing, we’re probably not going to go on a fishing trip to go see look at — we’re just not going to do that, that’s not what we do in this committee.\nThat is not a legitimate position for a member of Congress who has sworn to defend the Constitution; it’s an outrageous one for the chairman of the committee tasked with government oversight. Committee members might consider whether Chaffetz is willfully refusing to carry out his duties as chairman.\nAppearing on the same show, government ethics gurus Richard Painter and Norman Eisen scolded Chaffetz for a letter seeking to gag the Office of Government Ethics’ head Walter Shaub from discussing these matters publicly. Eisen asked, “Why is Congressman Chaffetz investigating Walter Shaub for doing his job, George, for speaking so courageously? It was one of the most extraordinary acts of courage that I’ve seen from a career public official.” He continued, “Instead of investigating the fact that the president-elect is going to be violating The Constitution with these flows of foreign [money], they admit they have a problem. They say, oh, well, we won’t — his lawyers said well, we want take the profits in the hotels. . . . Mr. Chaffetz should be investigating the president-elect’s impeding violation of the constitution, not this poor government official who is just trying to do his job. And Mr. Chaffetz has endorsed that unconstitutional plan.”\nPainter emphasized that “merely taking the profits from the hotels and putting those aside is not enough. They need to look at bank loans. They need to look at foreign banks leasing space in the Trump Tower.” He warned, “There are a broad range of issues that need to be dealt with. We’ve got the president’s name up on buildings in places where they could be a terrorist attack. This is a very precarious situation.”\nChaffetz, and Republicans who follow his lead, risk being tagged as constitutional hypocrites, concerned only when Democrats violate the law. They’ve rightly raised concerns when President Obama stretched executive power, but their lack of concern suggests their constitutional crocodile tears are thinly disguised partisanship. That’s how Evan McMullin, who ran as an independent conservative for president sees it. “Based on President-elect Trump’s foreign business interests it is likely that he’ll be in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution as president,” he told me. “If this is the case, the people’s representatives in Congress must hold him accountable. They cannot abide the erosion of the nation’s highest law without harming the people’s interests.” He added, “It will be the responsibility of the people to ensure that Congress fulfills its duties in this regard.”\nThat means Chaffetz’s constituents — and all Americans — have to insist Chaffetz and others do their job. Right now Chaffetz is enabling subversion of the plain text of the Constitution. If he does not discover his principles his constituents in 2018 should find someone who will. Hmm. McMullin is from Utah, right?", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@JRubinBlogger", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-15-17-reince-priebus-sen-bernie/story?id=44778012"], "published": "2017-01-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:49:24.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
