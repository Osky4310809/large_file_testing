A port, by the way, that's coming somewhere between the beginning of summer and the end of fall.\nIt's not exactly the most descriptive announcement, but at least you can plan accordingly if you happen to play it. I'm still pretty jealous that I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet, but the moment it comes west I'm creating an account.\nDragon Quest X [Hachima Kikou]\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:26:31.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
