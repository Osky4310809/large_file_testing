Chris is so confident in the fact that the next Guardians will be *the best movie ever made* it will solve so many problems around the world, and also win ALL the accolades, like the Super Bowl. And “39 Olympic Gold Medals,” including one for skiing.\nIn a beautiful, lengthy Facebook post, Chris shares a look at the brand new IMAX Guardians poster. That’s when he launches into a sweet tribute to the movie, right off the bat calling it better than Citizen Kane — which, movie fun fact, is considered to be one of the best movies of all time.\nWell, step aside Citizen Kane. Soon, isntead of being like, Star Lord, who? You’re going to be like, Rosebud, WHO? “On May 5th the greatest movie in the history of movies is coming,” Chris writes, not exaggerating at all. “There has never been and will never again be a movie like this. Seriously. Ever heard of Citizen Kane ? We’re much better. Seriously. Our movie just tested at over one million points. Rotten tomatoes already has it at 234% fresh. # GotGVol2 will win every movie award AND about 39 Olympic gold medals in swimming, gymnastics, the skiing event with the gun, x games, snowmobiling and everything.” Oh wait, but that’s not all.\n“[ Guardians ] will win the Worl d Cup and about 7 super bowl rings, sorry TOM Brady. This movie will fry your brains and lift your spirits. James Gunn will be elected president of the world. They will add the faces of the guardians to Mount Rushmore for sure. We’re gonna get a planet.” \nPlanet Guardians of the Galaxy? We’d be happy for just a new ride at Disneyland , but hey, a planet sounds fun, too. And now about those dinosaurs:\n“Global warming will stop. Dinosaurs will come back to life. Which unlike some movies might tell you, is actually a really good thing. Because they won’t flip out and kill people instead they’ll be your awesome pets. So basically get your tickets as soon as you can. Don’t be the only person on the planet who doesn’t see this movie.” & On May 5th the greatest movie in the history of movies is coming. There has never been and will never again be a movie...\nPosted by Chris Pratt on  Wednesday, March 22, 2017 We were already planning on seeing Guardians of the Galaxy the moment it lands theaters, and now we can’t wait to watch it at Superbowl LII, too.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T20:55:24.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
