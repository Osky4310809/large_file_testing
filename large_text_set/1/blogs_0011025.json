United will probably feel they are playing them at a good time and Liverpool will want to come out of that mini-rut pretty quickly.\" poll loading Who are you backing for Sunday's game at Old Trafford? 500+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T13:08:31.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
