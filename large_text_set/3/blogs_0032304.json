The changes reflect the number of low emission new vehicles made since 2001 (Picture: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images) If a car is registered after April 1 it will pay a one-off tax charge for the first year that varies depending on the CO2 emissions of the vehicle – measured in g/km.\nFrom the second year onwards all vehicles will pay a flat rate of £140 with the only exemption for vehicles that have zero emissions – electric.\nThe most significant change will be seen in the one-off first year payment which will jump dramatically. for higher emission vehicles.\nWhere as the standard rate will fall beyond the first year in some models.\nCars worth more than £40,000 will also pay an annual supplement of £310 between years two and six.\n(Picture: Gov.uk) As detailed by Auto Express , that differs significantly from the current first year rate set out below.\nThe current emissions bands that will change for new vehicles from April 1 (Picture: Metro.co.uk) For more information visit the DVLA .\nBy comparison, this means a car emitting 151g/km will be charged £500 instead of £180.\nThose emitting 171g/km will be charged £800 instead of £295.\nWhat does this mean for you? Buying befofe the system kicks in could save you a vast amount of money (Picture: Getty) James Hind, founder of carwow.co.uk said previously: ‘Some models will cost significantly more to tax each year, so there are long-term savings to be had by buying before the new system kicks in.\n‘Hybrid cars and small petrol-powered city cars will be cheaper to tax if you buy before April 1.’\nMORE: Up to eight children are feared dead after avalanche hits school climbing group \nMORE: Madeleine McCann ‘could still be alive – and her kidnapper has probably confessed’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T11:38:51.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
