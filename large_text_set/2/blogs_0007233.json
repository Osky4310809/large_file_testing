The show, which featured over 100 drones and most of Gaga’s hits, was widely praised on Twitter, Instagram, and in the media as well. It was inclusive , like she said it would be, and her voice was on point. Not that it needs to be discussed but, yes, her body also looked amazing. \nApparently not everyone felt that way. Some actually saw the need to focus on what she looked like, rather than how she sounded and the message she sent. Gaga is hitting back via Instagram to let her fans and critics know she’s not ashamed.

I could give you a million reasons why you don’t need to cater to anyone or anything to succeed. Be you, and be relentlessly you. That’s the stuff of champions. Thank you so much everyone for supporting me.” \nShe signs off by writing, “I love you guys. Xoxo, gaga.” \n[image via screen grab] \nHave a tip we should know?
