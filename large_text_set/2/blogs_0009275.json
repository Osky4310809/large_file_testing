Authorities are seeking to stem the breach with the help of helicopters. \n“Immediate evacuation from the low levels of Oroville and areas downstream is ordered. This is NOT A Drill. This is NOT A Drill. This in NOT A Drill,” says the statement posted on the Butte County Sheriff’s Facebook page. \nThe statement refers to the Lake Oroville Dam, located 105 km (65 miles) north of Sacramento. \nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the evacuation orders affect 188,000 people, AP reports. \nThe dam’s spillway was “predicted to fail within the next hour,” the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) said at around 4:30pm PST Sunday (00:30 GMT Monday). \n“DO NOT TRAVEL NORTH TOWARD OROVILLE,” the Yuba County Office of Emergency Services said on Facebook, urging evacuees to travel safely in all other directions and help the elderly. \nThousands of people from Yuba County and Sutter County have been filmed being evacuated from local towns and communities, with vehicles creating long traffic jams. \nDWR issued a statement, saying that there is no danger that the dam itself will collapse, as the incident had affected only an emergency spillway. \n“Oroville Dam itself is sound and is a separate structure from the auxiliary spillway,” the statement read. \nThe emergency is the first time in the 48-year-old dam’s history that an uncontrolled spillway is being used, local NBC affiliate KCRA-TV reported. \nHeavy rains and snow that struck California this winter have resulted in the dam’s reservoir being filled up to the point of overspill. On Thursday, the works to release water from the dam began after chunks of concrete from the spillway were discovered in the channel below. \nOn Friday, only 7 feet (2 meters) were left until the dam was to reach its full capacity. \nThe DWR has been using the emergency spillway instead of the damaged one to release the water. \nMeanwhile, a series of statements from the DWR included a seemingly bizarre plan to fill in the widening gorge in the spillway by dropping rocks from helicopters.
