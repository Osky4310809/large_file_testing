Share this video Watch Next \nFans praised the couple for their “normality”, leaving hundreds of comments on the images laughing about Rod’s attempt at a disguise and asking for an update as to whether he was noticed. \n“Love that everyone around is oblivious they have a legend riding with them,” said one Instagram user. “I’m in awe!” \nA second joked of the notoriously crowded commuter trains: “Now there’s someone I wouldn’t mind being squashed against!” \nA third pointed out there was a very modern reason why commuters may have walked past him without noticing: “Don’t worry, everyone is looking down at their phone!” Rod was en route to his London O2 Arena concert, pictured on stage.

It was the last date on his 2016 tour (Photo: Getty) The superstar isn't the first to get the tube to their own gig (Photo: Getty) Rihanna famously got the tube to the BRITs (Photo: Twitter) \nRod was off to London’s O2 Arena for the last date on his From Gasoline Alley To Another Country: Hits 2016 Tour. It was rearranged from November after a throat infection forced him to cancel the original date. \nRod isn’t the first celebrity to choose the London Underground when it comes to making their way to the O2 Arena, situated over in Greenwich, east London. \nNoel Gallagher, Jay Z, Rihanna, Chris Martin and Nicole Scherzinger have all been spied on the tube in the past, giving the commuters who noticed them a real treat in rush hour.
