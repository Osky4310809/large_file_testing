For the uninitiated, Diana is Priyanka Chopra's Pooch who is eleven posts old on Instagram, and already has over five thousand followers. If you are taken aback by her success, there are several pets on Instagram whose fandom is going to leave you amazed (and also slightly jealous, tbh). Here are five celebrity pets more famous than you, on social media. 1. Choupette Lagerfeld Early to bed. Early to rise (and wake Daddy @karllagerfeld) üåú#NationalCatDay A post shared by Choupette Lagerfeld (@choupettesdiary) on Feb 17, 2017 at 5:58pm PST \nFashion baron Karl Lagerfeld's kitty, Choupette has been refusing to eat food off the floor since 2012! With over 50 thousand (!!) Twitter followers and 94 thousand Instagram followers , you've got to admit, Choupette is as classic as Chanel No. 5. 2. Toulouse Grande s I wasn't kidding. @coach #coachpups I'm so incredibly excited to have my lil baby Toulouse starring in the Coach Pups campaign and to partner with Coach in efforts to protect pups from cruelty and harm, a cause most near and dear to my heart. So thankful to @Coach for their generous donation to NKLA, a Best Friends Animal Society Initiative to make LA the nation's largest no-kill city by 2017. proud of my babe, Toulouse-y goosessss. from rescue to runway!!! I love you with all my heart. A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jul 28, 2015 at 7:57am PDT \nAdopted by Ariana Grande, the Beagle-Chihuahua mix has been in the limelight since 2013. Toulouse boasts of 20 thousand followers on Twitter, and he has also been the face of Coach Pups (which included Lady Gaga's Asia, and Miranda Kerr's Frankie) along with accompanying Ariana on tour, and making an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. 3. Meredith and Olivia Swift They've come a long way since the hourly cat fights of the past. A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Feb 28, 2015 at 12:02am PST \nTaylor Swift named her two cats after her favourite T.V characters, Meredith Grey from Grey's Anatomy and Olivia Benson from Law and Order . The two have their own fan page on Twitter, and have been covered by publications like Cosmo and featured on BuzzFeed. While they don't have their own social pages, posts about them on the superstar's Instagram page almost always go viral. A February 2015 video of the two licking each other got over 1 million likes and 108.5 thousand comments. 4. Asia Kinney üèàüê∑ photo cred: @l_o_b_s_t_e_r_e_y_e #SB51 #pepsihalftime #gaga A post shared by Miss Asia Kinney (@missasiakinney) on Feb 5, 2017 at 3:53pm PST \nLady Gaga's French bulldog (three-years-old) has her own Instagram account.
