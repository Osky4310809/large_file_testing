He also said that he wanted to “rape” former Charlie Hebdo editor-in-chief, Charb – one of the victims of the January 2015 terrorist attacks – with a “Laguiole knife”. On Saturday, Mr Meklat cleaned his Twitter account – he went from 50,000 to 503 tweets – and issued a public apology, branding his hateful tweets as “obsolete” and “irrelevant”. Things you didn't know about Marine Le Pen Mon, February 20, 2017 Marine Le Pen is a French politician who is the president of the National Front, a national-conservative political party in France and one of its main political forces. AFP/Getty Images 1 of 10 Described as more democratic and republican than her nationalist father, she has led a movement of \"de-demonization of the Front National\" to detoxify it and soften its image MEHDI MEKLAT TWITTER Mr Meklat published his provocative tweets under a pseudonym He tweeted: “I’m sorry if some of you were shocked by my tweets. They are obsolete… The words of my fictional character do not reflect my own personal thoughts and beliefs, quite the opposite. Via Marcelin Deschamps, a provocative character, I was trying to encourage critical thinking.” I am going to slit your throat Muslim-style Mehdi Meklat His apology, however, has largely fallen on deaf ears. On Sunday, Marion Marechal Le Pen, Mrs Le Pen’s niece, tweeted: “Praising Merah, threats, homophobia, hate and anti-Semitism. Why is the press protecting @mehdi_meklat?” MEHDI MEKLAT TWITTER The blogger publicly tweeted apologies to his followers MEHDI MEKLAT TWITTER Marion Marechal Le Pen criticised Mr Meklat for his actions Members of the Printemps républicain, a left-wing organisation explicitly formed to promote and protect secularism in France, bitterly condemned Mr Meklat’s tweets in a press release and said that, had he been a member of France’s far-right, he would have been excoriated and denounced by the press “a very long time ago”. They wrote: “For years, Mr Meklat published racist, sexist and hate-filled tweets. And yet, editors and newspapers continued to hire and support him. \"If a far-right journalist had tweeted what Mr Meklat tweeted, he would have been lynched by the press and would probably have ended up in court.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:45:26.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
