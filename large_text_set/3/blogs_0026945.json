But if you are saying ‘We will bring in the PYD [Kurdish Democratic Union Party] while taking Daesh [IS] away,' Turkey will never allow it. We will not be involved in such an operation ,\" Kurtulmus told the Anadolu news agency. \nSaying that the anti-terrorist operation in Syria is a question of both Turkey's border protection and national security, Kurtulmus added that the issue of the Kurds' participation had been discussed with both the US and Russia. \n\" If peace is not established in Syria, there will be no regional peace. And if there is no regional peace, there will be no global peace ,\" the official warned. Read more While dozens of countries talk about fighting ISIS, Russia is actually doing it – Kremlin \nTurkey views the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its militant wing, YPG, which has been a key force fighting Islamic State militants in northern Syria, as linked to the PKK, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which operates in Turkey and Iraq. Ankara considers the PKK a terrorist organization and blames it for being behind the Kurdish insurgency in eastern Turkish regions. The US has designated PKK as a terrorist group, while supporting the YPG in Syria. Russia considers neither of the groups to be terrorist. \nThe Pentagon on Wednesday confirmed that US aircraft airlifted some fighters from Syrian Democratic Forces, a multinational Kurdish-dominated group, in a bid to retake the Tabqa Dam from Islamic State. US forces also provided fire support. \nEarlier Wednesday, US Senator John McCain, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that the Kurdish issue was an \" enormous challenge \" for Washington in regard to its relations with Ankara. \nSaying that the Trump administration is weighing the issue of providing the Kurdish fighters with heavy arms for the anti-IS offensive, the American official admitted the US faces \" tough decisions ,\" and should be careful not to cross its NATO ally. \n\" The conundrum is that if you don't use the Kurds, [the battle against IS] takes a lot longer... But if you do, you have an enormous challenge as far as relations with Turkey are concerned, including things like the use of Incirlik [military base] ,\" McCain told reporters as cited by AFP. The Turkish air base of Incirlik is heavily used by NATO and the US-led coalition to fight Islamic State in the region. \nWashington has been long involved in discussions with Ankara on how they \" might contribute to the liberation of the city \" of Raqqa, but apparently no agreement has yet been reached. \n\" We haven't come to an agreement about what that role will be or if there will be one, but we talk to Turkey through military channels and I believe at diplomatic levels every day. So, we'll have to let that continue to be worked out ,\" a US Department of Defense spokesperson told the media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:07:02.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
