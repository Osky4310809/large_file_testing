That’s a fairly tame ending to an acquisition that began with great drama. In December, AppDynamics, then valued at about $1.9 billion, announced its plan to go public. But in January, on the eve of the planned IPO, Cisco swooped in to make its rich offer and AppDynamics called off its coming out party.\nAppDynamics is set to operate as a separate business led by Wadwhani, who will report into Cisco csco senior vice president Rowan Trollope.\nSan Francisco-based AppDynamics offers software that it says can monitor the performance of most software applications running on-premises or on third-party cloud infrastructure, flagging problems before they get out of hand. It claims its differentiator is that it can also keep tabs on such things as a company’s product sales and inventory levels.\n“We provide an early warning system for enterprises by monitoring both applications and businesses,” Wadhwani told Fortune recently. “If Williams Sonoma understands, in real time, what products are selling and not selling, it can adjust what customers are offered.”\nCustomers include Charter Communications chtr , Allscripts mdrx , the Container Store, and Autotrader.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nAppDynamics competes with New Relic newr , CA Technologies, and other companies that offer application performance monitoring. Cisco, which made its name selling rafts of networking hardware into corporate data centers, will use AppDynamics to augment its smaller, but growing, software subscription business.\nCisco, like other hardware makers, has struggled as more of its customers use shared data centers run by cloud providers like Amazon amzn Web Services and Microsoft msft . That trend means that these businesses are buying less hardware to run in house.\nCisco will give AppDynamics broader sales and marketing coverage, Wadhwani said, and the combination of Cisco’s expertise in network infrastructure and AppDynamics visibility into applications will be a powerful combination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:28:04.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
