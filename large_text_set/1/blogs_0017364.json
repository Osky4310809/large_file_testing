Shutterstock/Bruce Stanfield, Getty Images/William Edwards \nOne of the available signs advertises the Muslim civil rights organization’s support for “justice & equality for all,” according to a press release sent to The Daily Caller. \nAnother sign on offer from CAIR reads “Say No to a ‘Muslim Registry.” \nA third pre-made CAIR sign Women’s March on Washington for the reads “Women’s Rights are Human Rights.” (RELATED: Taxpayer-Funded University Provides Segregated Women-Only Lunchroom) \nOne of the main speakers during the Women’s March on Washington will be Zahra Billoo, the director of CAIR’s San Francisco Bay Area office. \nOrganizers of the Women’s March on Washington had advertised the event as “inclusive,” but have since indicated that inclusion doesn’t extend to women who don’t support abortion . \nOne apparently major strategy for the Women’s March on Washington is that a huge throng of participants will festoon themselves with knitted, pink “pussy power hats” during the demonstration. (RELATED: Thousands Of Women Will Wear Pink, Knitted ‘Pussy Power Hats’ To Protest Trump) \nSymbolism is the key here. The organizers of the Pussyhat Project hope to make “a powerful visual statement” with the homespun, neon-pink “pussy power hats,” which feature perky cat-like ears. \nThe ribald name of the hats is an obvious reference to Trump’s notorious “ grab them by the pussy ” statements. \n“If everyone at the march wears a pink hat, the crowd will be a sea of pink, showing that we stand together, united,” a mission statement at the Pussyhat Project website explains. “Pink is considered a very female color representing caring, compassion, and love — all qualities that have been derided as weak but are actually STRONG. Wearing pink together is a powerful statement that we are unapologetically feminine and we unapologetically stand for women’s rights.” \nAlmost 225,000 people have indicated that they will march in the Women’s March on Washington. \nThe demonstration was originally billed as the “million women” march. \nCAIR will be handing out its blue and yellow signs at its Capitol Hill headquarters, which is not far from where the march will begin. \nCAIR is officially a partner organization for the march. \n“The historic Women’s March on Washington is an opportunity — and a duty — for American Muslims to demonstrate their support for other communities and for justice and equality,” CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement sent to TheDC. \nIn 2009, CAIR was listed by the U.S. government as an unindicted co-conspirator in a scheme that provided funding to the terror group Hamas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T04:02:16.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
