It injured his shoulder, cut his chin, cracked a rib, bruised a bicep and caused “a large, deep bruise to his leg.”\nBerg is suing the Elk Grove Park District, which owns and operates Fox Run, and the employee who was driving the forklift. Officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday evening.\nThe worker was driving “with complete and utter indifference to the probability that a golfer would be in the path of a porta-potty,” according to the negligence suit, which claims the course “uses unsafe means and methods of transporting toilets.”\nBerg is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\n(Source: Sun-Times Media Wire copy; Chicago Sun-Times 2017.
