Fresh off his collaboration with Young Scooter earlier today called “ Cook Up ,” Young Thug decides to come through tonight and drop off a new Wheezy-produced single & accompanying video called “Safe,” which is directed by Garfield Larmond. The whereabouts this record remain unknown at this time, but the song’s description reads: ““I Will Never Quit. Single Coming Soon.” So perhaps, maybe “I Will Never Quit” is the title of Thugger’s next single or even project for that matter. Either way, we’ll gladly take new Thugger any day of the week.
