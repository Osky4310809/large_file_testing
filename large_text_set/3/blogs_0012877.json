They were sparking and had small amounts of fire,” she said.\nFROM COINAGE: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous \nThe passenger, who remained unidentified in the news release and in photographs, said flight attendants were on hand to dump a bucket of water on the burning headphones. The battery and cover were melted and stuck to the floor of the plane.\nOther passengers on the plane “endured the smell of melted plastic, burnt electronics and burnt hair,” according to the news release.\n“People were coughing and choking the entire way home,” the passenger said.\nThe ATSB recommends passengers check batteries in devices that may catch fire. They remind passengers that batteries should be kept in approved stowage unless in use, and to keep spare batteries in carry-on luggage, not checked baggage.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T04:47:21.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
