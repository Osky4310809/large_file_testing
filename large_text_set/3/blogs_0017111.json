I’m talking about the establishment Republicans . \n“The #NeverTrumpers, the old-school Republicans who tried to derail the Trump train for a year are still at it.” The biggest culprits, Bolling said, were “John Lindsey McCain Graham,” making a portmanteau out of two of the most conspicuously liberal Republicans in the Senate caucus. \n“Who are these two has-been senators to demand the president do anything for them?” Bolling said.   \nAccording to USA Today and CNN , both Graham and McCain have demanded evidence from Trump on his wiretapping claims , one of a number of times they’ve clashed with the president. Both have arguably been Trump’s biggest enemies on the right. \nBolling said that the two should “get on board (the Trump Train) or get out of the way.” \n“The Trump train is an express to prosperity, no stops in RINO-Land planned,” he added. \nBolling also went after Paul Ryan, whose Obamacare replacement plan he called a “fat flop” which would sink Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign.
