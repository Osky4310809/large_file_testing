Straightforward from here: \n— Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) February 15, 2017 \nLet’s breakdown how this works, step-by-step. \n“1. Impeach Trump & Pence” \nEasy enough. Granted, I’m not sure what high crime or misdemeanor Mike Pence has been connected to, but better safe than sorry I guess? \n“2. Constitutional crisis” \nUmmmm… not really. The presidential line of succession is pretty clear. Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan would then become president. \n“3. Call special election” \nActually, there is no constitutional mechanism to call a “special election.” On the contrary, the U.S. Constitution is explicit that presidential elections are held every four years. We’d just have President Ryan. \n“4. Ryan v Clinton” \nAgain, no. We’d just have President Ryan. \n“5. President Clinton” \nThank you again for President Ryan. \nSo when can we start? \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T17:17:55.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
