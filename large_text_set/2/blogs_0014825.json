When the first Canadian soldiers arrived in the country in September 2014, their mission was to help train the Peshmerga to stop and hold back a confident and, until then, undefeated ISIL hoard.\nThat was the first phase of the now nearly two-and-a-half-year-old mission, before ISIL lost the upper hand.\nNow, flying by helicopter from Erbil, the Kurds’ capital in Iraq, to the Mosul Dam, one can see the barricades of dirt and defensive positions that helped the Peshmerga stop ISIL from overwhelming northern Iraq.\nThe trenches and stone buildings hastily constructed during that period two years ago lie abandoned today, as the war — and Canada’s role in it — shifted from defence to offence.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz Canadian special forces look over a Peshmerga observation post, Monday, February 20, 2017 in northern Iraq. Kurdish forces, supported by the Canadians, kicked off a long-anticipated attack to free Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, from ISIL in October.\nBut the Kurds and their Canadian comrades stopped short of Mosul, as planned. Instead, they shifted to fighting the extremist group in other ways and let the Iraqi military enter and clear ISIL from the city.\nBriefing reporters on Monday at Camp Erable, the Canadian military camp in Erbil, a special forces officer said the mission has turned toward identifying and monitoring potential ISIL targets in the region.\nThat includes keeping tabs through optical sights and other means, on “key enemy movement corridors” between Iraq and Syria as well as areas inside and immediately outside Kurdish territory.\nRelated U.S.-backed Iraqi forces launch major air-and-ground offensive to drive ISIL from western Mosul Iraqi Kurds to receive sniper rifles, anti-tank weapons, mortars from Canada ‘Claims sick but doesn’t have medical report’: File shows ISIL has ‘problem’ foreign fighters refusing to fight The officer said such monitoring helped locate ISIL forces inside a large town that was sidestepped during the early parts of the Mosul offensive and needed cleaning up.\nIt also means a decline in the number of times Canadian soldiers have actually fired their weapons in recent months, the officer said, as potential targets are relayed to the Iraqis and coalition for destruction.\nThe special forces officer, who asked not to be identified for security reasons, said the nature of the Mosul offensive had meant Canadian troops often found themselves in situations where they were required to fire.\nThat isn’t the case now, he said, adding that Canadian soldiers are specifically told to set up in locations where such circumstances are unlikely.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz A Peshmerga soldier mans an observation post, Monday, February 20, 2017 in northern Iraq. The Canadians continue to work with the Peshmerga. At the hilltop encampment, a number of fighters from the Kurds’ elite Zeravani stood guard on the perimeter while others relaxed inside.\nIn fact, the special forces officer said his soldiers have started working on a program that will train some Kurds to take on the role of instructors themselves.\nCapt. Dhyab Mohammed Omar, commander of the Peshmerga fighters, praised his Canadian comrades and the contribution they had made in helping the Kurds fight ISIL.\n“We are always honoured to have them at our positions,” he said. “It was my wildest dream to work with the Canadians. Having them show up and help us, we would die for them.”\nIt was my wildest dream to work with the Canadians. Having them show up and help us, we would die for them\nWhile much of the attention surrounding Canada’s mission in northern Iraq has been focused on the role being played by the special forces, they aren’t operating alone.\nRoughly 150 Canadian troops are stationed in Erbil, including a helicopter squadron, logistical staff, and medical personnel, all in support of the special forces mission and broader coalition fight against ISIL.\nFour Griffon helicopters from Canadian Forces Base Valcartier ferry troops and equipment from Camp Erable to the special forces troops in the field every day, zipping low like dragonflies over fields, around hills and past isolated communities to avoid enemy fire.\n“The challenge here is the more (power) wires and the weather during winter,” said Maj. Mathieu Bertrand, commander of the helicopter squadron. “We had some fog. But generally, the weather is good.”\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz A Canadian Forces Griffon helicopter flies over a Internal Displaced persons camp near Erbil, Iraq, February 20, 2017. Meanwhile, a Canadian military hospital located within Camp Erable’s small footprint, which itself is part of a larger coalition base dominated by the U.S., stands ready to provide aid to those wounded in battle.\nWhile the hospital, whose personnel hail from CFB Petawawa, has treated more than 100 patients for various injuries, Lt.-Col. Richard Morin said only 13 had received battlefield wounds. None were Canadian.\n“The predominance of cases we’re getting are emergency department-type casualties or patients that you would get when you get over 5,000 military troops all in one place,” he said.\nThe hospital has also treated a handful of ISIL fighters who were wounded and detained by coalition forces, which Morin said falls in line with the laws governing war.\n“We actually understand even in conflict, there are rules that you need to follow that â€¦ respects the dignity of life,” he said. “That’s what makes us different.”\nThe entire effort is underpinned by logistical personnel, led by Lt.-Col. Dominique Dagenais, who are responsible for Camp Erable and ensuring that everything runs smoothly.\nDagenais said the biggest challenge he faces is ensuring new personnel get their Iraqi visas in time to replace those who are nearing the end of their deployments.\nThe Iraqi government has in the past dragged its feet when it comes to Canada’s mission against ISIL, including delaying deployment of the military hospital and signing off on a plan to arm the Kurds.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:51:16.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
