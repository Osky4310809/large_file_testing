Iconic characters like the Hulk and Captain America are key members of the franchise, and Netflix has brought lesser-known heroes to life in its critically acclaimed series. Folks like Daredevil and Jessica Jones are becoming household names thanks to the streaming site, and Iron Fist will be the next to join. Later this year, the martial artist will get his own standalone series. Now, the show’s star is discussing how Danny Rand and his Iron Fist introduction will circle around to The Defenders down the road. UP NEXT: Krysten Ritter Is On Board For A Second Season Of The Defenders \nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Finn Jones spoke openly about how Iron Fist connected to The Defenders in terms of character development. According to the actor, Iron Fist depicts a Danny Rand who’s a “child trapped in a man’s body.” \n“ Iron Fist is like Danny in his adolescence, and The Defenders is like Danny taking responsibility and moving forward with his purpose,” Jones continued. “He’s craving desperately for family, for help, for guidance, for people to learn from, and for a team [in The Defenders]. But because of what happens in Iron Fist, he’s very untrusting. It’s really his way or no way.” \nLater on, Jones even said that he sees The Defenders rounding out the first whole season of Danny Rand’s emotional journey. \n“I see it as kind of this journey where Iron Fist and The Defenders is like the complete first season of Danny’s journey,” he explained. \n“It’s really nice to play it back-to-back because Danny does go through this awesome huge arc, so the end of Iron Fist is like the halfway point… In The Defenders, he’s got a grasp of who he is and he’s trying to do something with it. It’s great to play that consistently over the year and not have that broken up.” \nJones will then reprise the role for Marvel’s the Defenders, which teams Iron Fist up with Marvel Television’s other Netflix stars: Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), and Luke Cage (Mike Colter). \nMarvel’s The Defenders premieres later in 2017.
