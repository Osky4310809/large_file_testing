Then there was the classic story of the guy who threw an alligator into a Wendy's drive-thru window. \nHell, countless drug deals have gone down at the drive-thru, as have illegal hacking operations . \nBut we now know that it doesn't take all that much to attract police attention at the drive-thru. \nEarlier this month, police were summoned to a Taco Bell in South Euclid, Ohio because one woman really, really wanted the chain's Mild hot sauce, but—to her great dismay—only Taco Bell's \"Fire\" sauce was available. The disgruntled taco-eater refused to leave the drive-thru line and caused a back-up of several cars, all because her preferred sauce was unavailable. \nCondiments rule, but really? \nREAD MORE: A Guy Shot Up A Taco Bell Because They Forgot to Add Sour Cream to His Order \nWhen questioned by the police, the frustrated customer explained the situation. She told them that Taco Bell should at least have offered to give her the meal at half price, if they wanted her to make do with fire sauce—or (gasp) no sauce at all. \nThe police were evidently quite patient with the mild-sauce-loving customer, and explained to her that the problem \"was not likely going to be resolved at the drive-thru window,\" suggesting that she return the next day to speak to a manager. \nAfter all, no police officer wants to deal with a dispute involving taco sauce, but the South Euclid police department might want to console themselves with this thought: At least they didn't have to remove a couch or tackle an alligator. You just never know what you'll find in the drive-thru lane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T06:07:49.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
