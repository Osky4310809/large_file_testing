The restaurant posted the order ticket to its Facebook page, and of course, they obliged.\n\nFacebook \nThe customer, who didn't want to be named, ordered a pizza and begs the delivery person to visit a supermarket on their way to the house to pick up some medicine. The note reads:\n\"Will you please stop in [pharmacy] spar on the way and get me benylin cold and flu tablets,\" she wrote in her unusual request. \"I'll give you the money, only ordering food so I can get the tablets I'm dying sick.\"\n\nThe chip shop obliged, and people on Facebook seemed to love the good customer service. Their Facebook post attracted some 14,000 likes and 3,500 shares.\nOne of them was from the customer, who confirmed that the medicine had indeed arrived. \n\nFacebook \nThe act has since gone viral, with hundreds of commenters saying that they'll order from the fish and chip shop.\n\"Our news and radio shows here in south Australia are talking about this great service travels far haha,\" one commenter wrote. \n\"Haha! We're getting this news here in the Philippines. First time I'm hearing about Feeleys in the other part of the planet. Nice news,\" wrote another.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T04:06:29.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
