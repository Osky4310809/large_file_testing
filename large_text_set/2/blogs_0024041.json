Other photos appear to show her using an outdoor shower to rinse sand off her legs. Michaella McCollum with Melissa Reid from Scotland.

I'm not a bad person...' \nAnd recently she took to Facebook where she thanked all those who had supported her since her release. \nMcCollum recently wrote on Facebook: \"'Please know I truly appreciate each one who cared and had my back. \n\"Thank you for all the sweet messages I have not got reading them all just yet or got a chance to reply to them but I will definitely make a good attempt to get back to you all. \n\"It has been a long ride to get where I am today but it just shows that when we fight hard enough for something we can achieve it. \n\"Something to have in mind when one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us.\" \nShe has also been posting photos of herself in Marbella on Instagram.
