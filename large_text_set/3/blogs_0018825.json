The food-loving rapper immortalizes the exclusive restaurant from the Major Food Group crew on his recently dropped album, More Life . On the last song called “Do Not Disturb” — an introspective look from Drake about how he works and how fame has impacted him— he raps about closing out Carbone. Here is the line : Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on a rotary phoneI take a glass of Dom'ignon to go with me home Drake has, in fact, actually eaten at Carbone — both the one in New York and the one in Las Vegas. He celebrated his birthday with food from the restaurant two years in a row. For his 29th birthday in 2015, Drake hosted a party at the Carbone in Las Vegas at the Aria hotel. In 2016, the artist had his 30th birthday catered by Carbone . Dishes like spicy rigatoni, veal parm, and the Caesar alla ZZ were served . He and Rihanna were also spotted at the restaurant’s outpost in New York last August while they were dating . The rapper has waxed about his favorite restaurants before. He’s talked about eating at spendy sushi chain, Nobu , and he shot an entire video in a Cheesecake Factory for a song where the mall chain is mentioned — suggesting that Drake’s restaurant aesthetic is apparently go big or go home. That said, he’s not in alone in his love for Carbone, Nobu, or Cheesecake Factory. All of them have seen more than their fair share of celebrities, from the Kardashians to Adele. Even Barack Obama can’t resist the siren song of the veal parm and red sauce at Carbone. He’s been to the restaurant several times in the last few years .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:31:11.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
