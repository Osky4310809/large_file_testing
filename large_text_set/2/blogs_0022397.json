Veterans of Test cricket are still effective in the abridged format of the game—at a hefty price\nGame theory Feb 23rd 2017 by T.W.\n IF YOU are searching for evidence that cricket is gradually fragmenting into two different sports, the 2017 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) might be a good place to start. The competition pits eight star-studded teams against each other in the Twenty20 format, an abridged and heavy-hitting version of the sport launched in 2003. The most eye-catching acquisition in Monday’s pre-tournament auction was the purchase by Royal Challengers Bangalore of Tymal Mills: a 22-year-old English fast bowler who has never played an international match in the more prestigious five-day Test-cricket format (a congenital back condition makes playing such lengthy games impossible). Yet Mr Mills (pictured above) landed a contract worth $1.75m for this year’s IPL, making him the second most valuable overseas player in its 10-year history.\nHe is not the only big-money signing to have limited experience in Test cricket. Also looking forward to hefty salaries this year are Chris Morris, Glenn Maxwell, Mohit Sharma, Kieron Pollard, James Faulkner and David Miller—all of whom will earn at least $800,000 during the six-week bonanza. Those contracts represent significant investments, since each franchise has a salary cap of just $10m. In spite of their apparent value, the half-dozen signings have played just six international Test matches between them.\nThere are other signs of divergence between the player pools for international Test fixtures and Twenty20 cricket, which is played by national sides but also in lucrative domestic competitions (of which the IPL is the richest). At the start of 2008, the year the IPL began, 54 batsmen and 55 bowlers were ranked in the top 100 for both Test and Twenty20 cricket, according to the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) player ratings . This year just 34 and 29 are. This is best illustrated by the West Indies team that won the ICC World Twenty20 Cup last year: just three of the 15-man squad have subsequently played a Test match.\nA few forces could be pushing the formats apart. The first is that the different skills needed to excel at Twenty20 has players starting to specialise. Twenty20 demands batsmen who can blast plenty of runs in a matter of minutes, rather than gradually build an innings over several days. Bowlers must bamboozle these aggressive hitters instead of probing at a batsman’s defence for hours at a time. The second is the fatigue the comes with playing both forms of the game. Repeatedly hurling the ball can fatigue and eventually injure fast bowlers. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, Australia’s leading pacemen, stayed out of this year’s IPL to ensure their fitness for international fixtures. James Anderson and Stuart Broad of England have not played a single IPL match between them.\nThe third factor is the money. A select few Test-cricketers have “central contracts” with their national sides, earning annual fees between $700,000 and $900,000. Others are not so lucky: a report published last year found that a top Test player in New Zealand, Sri Lanka or the West Indies earns around $230,000 for his efforts, which makes him more likely to be lured by the IPL’s riches.\nYet these forces have changed the IPL less than you might think. Of the 50 best-paid players in this year’s tournament, 19 can be considered “veterans” of Test cricket, with at least 30 caps. That is fewer than the 24 veterans in 2008, but not a huge shift. Looking at “regular” bowlers and batsmen (those who deliver or face at least 100 balls), the share of the action produced by Test veterans has hardly budged. They took 18% of the “regular” wickets last year, compared with 22% in the inaugural tournament. And they made 42% of the “regular” runs in 2016, against 41% in 2008.\nOn Twenty20’s most flashy stage, grizzled five-day players are as effective as ever, especially with the bat. Virat Kohli, Kane Williamson and Joe Root, the Test captains of India, New Zealand and England, are all in the ICC’s top-five list of Twenty20 batsmen. And though some specialists are picking up big cheques, those with experience in the five-day format still command a premium. On average, a batsman with 30 Test caps cost around $1m in 2016, versus $567,000 for a non-veteran. Among regular bowlers, the discrepancy was $831,000 to $297,000.\nThe eight franchises are clearly happy to pay those extra costs. Given that the winning franchise reportedly gets just $3m in prize money, the ability of household Test-match names to sell tickets and replica shirts is probably more important than their productivity on the pitch, which is not much different from non-veterans. And as long as the big bucks remain available, a handful of cricketers will be willing to juggle their five-day commitments with glamorous nights on the sub-continent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=", "https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=", "http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/", "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20170225_BLP518.jpg", "http://www.thefica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/L-FICA-International-Cricket-Structural-Review-2016-single-page.pdf"], "published": "2017-02-23T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:49:24.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
