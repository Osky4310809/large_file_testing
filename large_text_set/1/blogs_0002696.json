He is a protege of Dino Babers and had worked under him at Bowling Green prior to Sowder’s time at Texas in 2016. He also coached under Babers at Eastern Illinois, where his receivers and the offense had record-breaking seasons. \nSowder was a student coach at Baylor, assisting Babers with the wide receivers and special teams in 2009 and 2010 following a playing career with the Bears, where he learned Art Briles’ offense. Sowder had been a tight end at Baylor during the 2007 and 2008 seasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T08:58:29.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
