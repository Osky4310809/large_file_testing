LaBeouf was also arrested at one exhibition for punching a man who made a comment about Hitler into the live feed. \nREAD MORE: Shia LaBusted: Actor LaBeouf arrested for assault at anti-Trump protest (VIDEO) \nOn March 8, the decision was made to livestream a flag emblazoned with the group’s message in an “unknown location” for the duration of Trump’s presidency. \nBut in a matter of hours, saboteurs figured out Labeouf’s flag hideaway was in a Tennessee field, despite only having views of the sky to go on. \nFootage shows how the flag was replaced by a Trump T-shirt and a “Make America Great Again” hat. \nComments on Reddit, 4Chan and Twitter suggest the flag’s capture was aided by online sleuths studying “plane contrails” and even star patterns.

I’m sorry but the idea of 8 years of playing capture the flag with Shia Labeouf is just hilarious to me \n— punished inspector (@GenericMisaka) March 9, 2017 \n“The feat is impressive enough without having to pretend that stars and contrails contributed,” wrote one Reddit user, adding: “In the end it was good old-fashioned luck and manpower that accomplished the capture.” \nAnother posted: “The planes may have helped a little, but the stars and sh*t are bulls*t”. \nVia RT .
