Of course, the only thing anyone cares about is whether or not Nick finally gave Raven the big O sheâ€™s been dreaming of.\nRaven: Â â€œI will say this: Nick is really good at what he does, so Iâ€™m pretty satisfied today.â€\nWe get it: You had sex. Queue theÂ most absurd montage of all time, which included Raven running around Iceland, high-fiving random people and making snow angels â€” as one does after experiencing their very first orgasm, naturally. So weâ€™re going take that as a yes. Well done, Nick.\nRELATED VIDEO: Rachel Lindsay on Being the Next Bachelorette â€”Â â€˜My Journey of Love Isnâ€™t Any Different Just Because My Skin Color Isâ€™ \nFANTASY SUITE DATE WITH RACHEL Rachel may be a terribleÂ cross-country skier, but at least the girl knows how to laugh at herself. Three cheers for the next Bachelorette .\nAfter their adventurous morning, Nick and Rachel sat down for the *deepÂ convo* that had to happen because sheÂ still hadnâ€™t dropped the L word. Luckily, Nick madeÂ much better sweater choicesÂ this week so it was easier to take him seriously. #NeverForget the great white turtleneck fiasco of 2k17.\nThis embed is invalid\nWOW Nick had all the jokes on this date:\nRachel: Â â€œYouâ€™re rare â€” and refreshing.â€\nNick: Â â€œI might be white, but Iâ€™m still a minority!â€\nBy the time the evening portion of their date rolled around, RachelÂ still hadnâ€™t said it, so Nick decided to take matters into his own hands.\nNick: â€œIf you were to check your ego at the door, what would your heart say?â€\nIs that how to get someone to tell you theyâ€™re in love with you? Well, take notes, guys â€” it actually worked. Rachel told Nick she was falling in love with him â€Ś and he said it back : â€œRachel, I am falling for you, 100 percent. Thatâ€™s easy to say.â€\nActual footage of Ben Higgins watching this moment unfold:\nThis embed is invalid\nThen they spent the night together in the Fantasy Suite and the next morning, NickÂ made her breakfast. WTF, why didnâ€™t Raven get scrambled eggs?\nFANTASY SUITE DATE WITHÂ VANESSA Vanessa puked on her firstÂ one-on-one with Nick, so this time the producers decided to go easy on her and stick her in a nice frigid ice bath.\nSeriously, where did Nick and Vanessa get those matching bathing suits? #CoupleGoals.\nIn between jumping in and out of the ice bath together, Nick and Vanessa had quite a few serious conversations, mostly focused on the fact that A) Vanessa and her family are quite traditional, while Nick is not, and B) whetherÂ Nick and Vanessa might be a little too similar. (A.k.a. theyâ€™re both really stubborn, passionate, and always want to be right. Nickâ€™s words, not ours. But also not wrong.)\nLater that evening, things got even more serious when they discussed where they would settle downÂ after the show if Nick, who lives in the U.S., chooses Vanessa, who lives in Montreal, Canada.\nIt was pretty obvious that Nick isÂ not down to move to Canada with himÂ admitting that honestly, itâ€™s â€œnot easyâ€ for him to picture that move and that he hopes thatâ€™s â€œnot a non-negotiable.â€ Meanwhile, Vanessa never once mentioned being okay with living anywhereÂ else, so this should work out splendidly.\nFinally, Vanessa told Nick she loves him. Nick didnâ€™t say it back, but they went on to spend the night together in the Fantasy Suite and lookedÂ very Â happy waking up in bed togetherÂ the next morning.\nRELATED VIDEO:Â Nick Viall Teases That His Bachelor Â Run â€˜Ended the Way It Should Haveâ€™ \nROSE CEREMONY Nick was crying before he even started the rose ceremony. Like, he could barely speak. The first rose went to Raven, then Vanessa â€” meaning Rachel wasÂ going home. Of course, everyone knew this breakup was coming because Rachel wasÂ announced as the next Bachelorette weeks ago, but that didnâ€™t stop the moment from being really, really sad.\nRachel: â€œItâ€™s hard to hear how great you are and how much love somebody has for you but then they still donâ€™t choose you. I swear, thatâ€™s like the story of my life.â€\nHang in there, Rachel. The tables are about to turn in a big way for you.\nThe Bachelor Â continues with a two-hour Â Women Tell All Â episode starting at 9 p.m. ET, and the finale airs next Monday at 8 p.m. ET, both on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:27:59.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
