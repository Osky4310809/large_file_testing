It’s kind of hard to believe,” Officer Tamara Valle told ABC affiliate WFAA .\nA store manager told police he believes the musical marauder first came into the store to hide the guitar before returning to retrieve it, WFAA said.\nIn the video, the man is wearing a dark-colored baseball cap, bright red vest and black track suit with white stripes. He ducks behind a display rack, picks up the guitar and, a few seconds later, adjusts his shirt. He slowly walks out of the store with his hands in his pockets.\n“You figure somebody would see it immediately but watch that video,” said Valle.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:23:41.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
