Dannel P. Malloy to seek increased gun restrictions. \nDuring her campaign , Clinton said that she was going to “tackle the gun lobby” on day one of her presidency. She also praised New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who would go on to be named the Senate minority leader, for being “one of the most effective legislators in taking on the gun lobby.” \nThose remarks reportedly inspired increased gun ownership at a rate the state had not seen since 2013, shortly after then President Barack Obama — who also promised to bring about stricter regulations on firearms — had been re-elected. Nearly 26,700 permits had been issued during that year. \nConnecticut has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, with a permit being required to obtain not only a license but also to buy and carry a sidearm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:02:38.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
