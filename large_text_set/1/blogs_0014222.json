Related: Jon Gruden gave Rams organizational assessment; did he discuss McVay? \nMcVay most recently coached as the offensive coordinator of Washington. He had been with that organization since 2010, so he’s not exactly new to the coaching world. \nLane Kiffin was 31 when he was hired as the Oakland Raiders head coach, so he’s not shockingly young either. \nBut as Chris Burke noted on Twitter, McVay was born the same year that former Rams coach Jeff Fisher officially started his coaching career. That should add some necessary perspective. Sean McVay was born in 1986, the same year that Jeff Fisher started his coaching career as a DBs coach in Philadelphia. \n— Chris Burke (@ChrisBurke_SI) January 12, 2017 \nHe is younger than defensive players William Hayes and Eugene Sims ( via Greg Beachem ). \nThe new Rams coach is also the grandson of John McVay, who was the GM of the San Francisco 49ers and a former New York Giants head coach. Related: Rams coach candidate Sean McVay lists Wade Phillips as top pick for DC \nAs head coach, McVay would like to bring Broncos assistant Wade Phillips as his defensive coordinator. \nIt’s unclear as of now who he would want to bring in as offensive coordinator or if he wants a new general manager to replace Les Snead. Keep an eye on Wade Phillips as the DC for the #Rams and new coach Sean McVay. Would have a top OC (McVay) and top DC (Wade). \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 12, 2017 Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:02:50.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
