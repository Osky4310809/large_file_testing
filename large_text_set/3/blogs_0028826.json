Xiaomi’s Weibo post hints the Mi 6 could be powered by the Snapdragon 835 SoC By March 24, 2017 \n“Xiaomi’s Mi 6 seems to be shaping as a fully loaded flagship smartphone” \nSeveral reports in the past have suggested that Xiaomi’s Mi 6 could be powered by Qualcomm’s latest flagship SoC, the Snapdragon 835. Analyst Kevin Wang had also suggested that the Mi 6 would be the first flagship in China to feature a Snapdragon 835 processor. Now, Xiaomi Mobile’s official Weibo page has hinted that the Mi 6 may come with a Snapdragon 835 SoC. \nQualcomm’s Weibo page posted about the features of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 flagship SoC. Xiaomi then proceeded to share Qualcomm’s post with the line – “I come, I see, I conquer” accompanied by a Snapdragon 835 hashtag. This doesn’t exactly confirm the presence of the SoC on the Mi 6, but certainly, it adds fuel to the fire regarding these rumours. \nRumours suggest that Xiaomi will first launch the Mi 6 with a Snapdragon 821 processor, followed by a Snapdragon 835 variant at a later date. The company is expected to unveil the phone sometime in April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T09:15:13.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
