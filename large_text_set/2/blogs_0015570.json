Liverpool made wholesale changes for their ties against Plymouth and Wolves (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty) \n“Maybe we foreign managers, not everybody studies and understands the culture of this country. Normally it’s because of attitude - because you think it’s easy, and it’s not easy. \n“Also, the lower-league teams, they’re getting better and better. \n“In my case, I had it immediately at Chelsea in my first time, that situation, with a match at Newcastle. So for me it was a lesson. \n“I threw it away. In the same week was the Champions League against Barcelona and the League Cup final against Liverpool.

It was good, because we beat Barcelona [5-4 on aggregate] and won the final against Liverpool. But the feeling that I threw it [the FA Cup] away wasn’t good. \n“So I don’t throw it away [now]. If I lose, I lose because the opponent was better or because we didn’t play well, but I’m not going to throw it away. \n\"I try always to go serious. I like Wembley, I like the FA Cup, so I have to try to get a second one.” \nUnited dispatched Rovers' fellow second-tier sides Reading and Wigan, both 4-0, in the previous rounds and go to Ewood Park looking to book a quarter-final place. \n“We played already Reading and Wigan from the Championship, so the level is not new for us,” said Mourinho, who won the Cup in 2007 during his first spell as Chelsea boss.

No. I’m going to change a few players, obviously. But I’m going with a good team. \n\"I respect the competition a lot and Manchester United demands you go serious to every game.” poll loading Will Manchester United retain the FA Cup this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:43:41.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
