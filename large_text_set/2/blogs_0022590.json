But Ethier says he's fully healed now and ready to compete for a starting outfield job. \n\"I talked to a few other athletes that had the kind of fracture I had, and they said it takes 12-18 months,\" said Ethier. \"But I worked out with every drill possible, landing on my leg at different angles, and it's 100 percent.\" \nâ€¢ Spring Training: Information | Tickets | Schedule | Gear \nEven if a healthy Ethier means the Dodgers have a crowded outfield, that's a problem worth having. Following a bounce-back season in 2015, Ethier was on fire last March when he fouled a pitch off his right leg and suffered a freakish spiral fracture that just wouldn't heal. He returned in September to play in 16 games, appearing on defense only once. \nHaving watched from the sidelines last year as the Dodgers went through 55 players, he laughs when he hears suggestions that the Dodgers have too many quality players.

He also became a father for the third time. Ken Gurnick has covered the Dodgers since 1989, and for MLB.com since 2001.
