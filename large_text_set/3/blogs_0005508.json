Those two things are get old and stop dunking. 36-year-old Richard Jefferson dunked on 22-year-old Terry Rozier and Rozier was not happy.

The moral of the story is don’t get dunked on by Richard Jefferson and you’ll be fine. And if you do, don’t throw the ball at him like a child on a playground.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:06:45.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
