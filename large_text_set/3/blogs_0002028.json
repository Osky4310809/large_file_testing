After Sinead said she was \"100% sure its Daniel's\", one said on Twitter: \"I bet Sinead's 100% WRONG lol #Corrie\". \nAnother added: \"I bet that Sinead's baby is Chesney's...#corrie\" while a third chimed in: \"It is definitely Chesney's baby. I'm telling you now #Corrie.\" \nOthers also waded into the fray, adding: \"Watching Corrie and Sinead saying that her baby is Daniel's so it probably that other bloke's,\" and: \"Sinead is just covering herself #Corrie\".

They’ve been arguing. \n\"Daniel sees a quirky girl in Sinead and he calls her mysterious and exotic. The situation with Chesney kind of pushes them together.” \n“They first sleep together in the factory. Daniel needs somewhere quiet to study and Sinead keeps doing overtime at the factory so she invites him to work there.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T12:22:01.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
