Listen, I drive from coast to coast and this s*** is flat to me. You mean to tell me that China is under us? It’s not. The world is flat.” \nNow, Shaq is an intelligent college graduate, he holds a doctorate degree in education, and he is downright lovable — but this is just plain lunacy.   \nWhen one of his co-hosts on the podcast referred to the satellite images of the Earth clearly showing that the world is indeed round — it’s insane that we are having this discussion in 2017 — Shaq responded that the images could have been manipulated. \nHe went further.
