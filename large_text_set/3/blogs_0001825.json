In fact, when you put the restrictive FQHCs together, they received a total of $38 million in federal grants just last year (on top of additional taxpayer funding). \nHere’s the kicker: \nIronically, representatives at several religious health centers that refused to offer contraception referred Rewire to Planned Parenthood , an option that may no longer be available should Planned Parenthood be defunded. \nAs much as I believe access to abortion shouldn’t be up for public debate, birth control absolutely shouldn’t be up for public debate. But if Republicans, with their fact-free approach to governing, have their way, a lot of women will have to struggle to meet their basic healthcare needs. \n(Image via Shutterstock .
