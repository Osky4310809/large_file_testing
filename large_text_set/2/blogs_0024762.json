He had injury set him back or an injury he was overcoming, or the Cardinals just had him on a reduced throwing program because the fewer innings he threw in March the more he’d be available to throw when the games matter. \nOr, so the theory went. \nNot so this spring. \nThe way the schedule is currently set, Wainwright will start Thursday’s game against his former team, Atlanta, he said. Carlos Martinez could have his schedule slowed, which would be one reason Wainwright would be shifted off Thursday. Either way, it will be the first of six possible starts for the Cardinals’ veteran starter during Grapefruit League. That’s one fewer than he’s thrown in the previous two springs combined. And he asked for it. \n“I’d rather go into the season knowing I’m prepared, rather than question marks,” Wainwright said Sunday morning. “Two years ago it was a necessity. Last year was somewhat of a necessity. There’s no reason to go short anymore. I used to really like coming into the season prepared. This year, I’ll be very prepared.” \nThe standard program for starters is to throw 40 pitches in their first exhibition game and then advance steadily to be ready to throw 100. Pitching coach Derek Lilliquist likes the pitchers to be ready to throw 100, and that can mean go as far as 90 or more in their final spring game. \nVeteran pitchers, especially those who prefer to “save their bullets” for the regular season, can get four starts during spring training and be ready. Wainwright has had four and three in the previous two springs, and he did not reach 90 pitches in any of those final starts. \nThe Cardinals’ established ace is coming off the most frustrating season of his career, though he enters the year coming off a healthy, full-strength offseason. There was no elbow surgery to recover from, and no Achilles’ tendon rupture to build around. He just added upper-body weight and overall strength and had no rehab — only prep.
