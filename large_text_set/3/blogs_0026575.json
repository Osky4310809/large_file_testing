Video: Nadal laughs at Federer's audacious shot \nA brilliant clip of their mutual respect has emerged from the 2011 Mubadala World Tennis Championship. \nAfter Federer pulled off one particularly outrageous shot, Nadal could help but laugh at his opponent’s talent and audacity. \nYou can watch it here… \nWe’ll all miss them both when they retire. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
