About 65 percent of Americans report having unprotected sex , and of that group, nearly 30 percent of them never use a condom during sex, the survey found. \nThat’s a problem: STD rates are higher than ever —but consistently using a condom correctly is nearly 100 percent effective at preventing transmission of diseases like gonorrhea and chlamydia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nPlus, STDs aren’t the only thing you might worry about. When used correctly , condoms also help prevent unintended pregnancies, the CDC says. Yet, of the study participants who said they’d be “devastated” by a pregnancy, 1 in 5 of them engaged in unprotected sex every time. So even though they desperately want to avoid a pregnancy, they aren’t taking the measures to avoid it. (Here’s why “pulling out” as birth control is so risky as birth control is so risky .) \nSo if condoms can help you avoid nasty infections and premature fatherhood, why have men stopped using them? \nThere are a couple of theories, says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., a sex researcher at Indiana University. Younger guys often view condoms as just a birth control method, and might be unaware of how important they are for STD prevention. On top of that, many guys are influenced by porn , where condoms are hardly ever worn, she explains. \nIf you’re currently having casual sex with multiple people, you’re better off wrapping up with a rubber until you feel comfortable with your partner, Herbenick says. Once you’re in a long-term relationship—and pregnancy is the only concern—talk to your partner about looking into other effective birth control methods if you can’t stand the way condoms feel. \nUntil then, finding the best-feeling condom and using a little lubricant (we like this one from the Men’s Health store) can make doing the deed safer and sexier. \nAdditional reporting by Markham Heid", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:13:35.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
