First of all, they don’t exist, and if they did, they would be cool! And even though I don’t believe in ghosts, I really wish I did. Here’s why. 1. They wouldn't be scary \n(source) \nWhy do people assume that just because someone dies, they're all of a sudden evil? Most people are good, so most ghosts would be good, too. They’d probably just want to hang out and watch TV and sh*t, just like alive people. 2. It would be interesting \n(source) \nI think anything that makes life more interesting is good. I want the universe to be more complicated than even I can understand! Not only do I hope there are ghosts, I hope there are lots of things weirder than ghosts that I can’t even imagine. 3. I want to meet a ghost \nThis goes in with the other points, but I realize I hadn’t clarified this yet. I hope ghosts are real because I want to meet one personally. 4. Ghosts mean there’s life after death \n(source) \nNot only do I want to meet a ghost, I want to BE a ghost. I find death super depressing. The idea of dying and being gone for the rest of eternity honestly makes me want to vomit. Being a ghost is much preferable. 5. We could chat about the past \n(source) \nI love history and it would be amazing to actually talk to someone who lived through it. I want to talk to ghosts who traveled on the Titanic, who saw the Civil War, who got in the Guinness Book of World Records for something really stupid. 6. I love Patrick Swayze \n(source) \nI miss him. :( \nSo if you know of any haunted castles or hotels or boats where I could meet a ghost, hit me up! I’ll go, I’ll spend the night, and even bring a Ouija board. Do you believe in ghosts? Do you wish you did?
