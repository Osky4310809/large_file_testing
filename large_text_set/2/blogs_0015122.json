The American manager was standing just inside the touchline and decided to stick a foot in. La Volpe se fue expulsado. ¿Se te hizo roja? pic.twitter.com/uJO2j70Dss — Univision Deportes (@UnivisionSports) February 19, 2017 \n\nLa Volpe was immediately sent to the stands, and after his team’s defeat to its rival in Guadalajara, there’s speculation it could be the last time he manages Las Aguilas.
