This is a huge accomplishment because it already did this once before – with the same rocket, on the same barge, when it landed last year following a successful launch during a resupply mission to the International Space Station. \nThe recovery of the Falcon 9 means that not only did SpaceX reuse its rocket with this launch – it can also potentially use it again, after more stress testing and evaluation. \n“It’s an amazing day for space as a whole, and for the space industry,” Musk said in an interview immediately following the recovery. “You can fly and refly an orbit class rocket, which is the most expensive component of spaceflight.” \n“It’s been fifteen years to get to this point.
