(AP) Former NFL running back Trent Richardson is facing a misdemeanor domestic violence charge in Alabama. \nPolice in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover say the 26-year-old Richardson was jailed Friday with bond set at $1,000. \nA police statement says officers received a call about yelling coming from a guest room at a hotel Thursday night. It says police responded and found a woman with scratches and bruises on her face. \nThe statement says the two argued earlier at a Walmart store, and the dispute continued at the hotel. Paramedics treated the woman, but she didn’t require further medical attention. \nRichardson played football at Alabama before turning pro. He spent four seasons total in the NFL at Cleveland and Indianapolis. \nRecords aren’t yet available to show whether Richardson has a lawyer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:13:49.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
