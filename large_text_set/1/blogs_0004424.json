We want to do well ourselves and that was a big statement from us. Hopefully we can go even further.\" \nAlli now has seven goals in his past four matches and three consecutive braces, and he felt toppling Chelsea - who are still seven points better off than third-place Spurs at the summit - represented a \"big statement\". \n\"This is a massive game. I don't think there's any hiding how big this game is for Tottenham, for the club and for the fans as well,\" he added. \n\"There were a lot of things that went into it today and you saw that from the performance of the boys. We fought from the first whistle to the last and it was a deserved win. \n\"It's a big statement for us but we're happy to stay under the radar and take each game as it comes. We did that last season.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T02:11:23.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
