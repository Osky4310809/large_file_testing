Naive as hell, Mark Zuckerberg dreamed he could build the tools that would connect people at unprecedented scale, both domestically and internationally.\nHe still clings to that hope while facing increasing attacks about the role that Facebook is playing in magnifying social divisions.\nAlthough critics love to paint him as only motivated by money, he genuinely wants to make the world a better place and sees Facebook as a tool to connect people, not empower them to self-segregate.\nFlickr / Tom Woodward\nThe problem is not simply the “ filter bubble ”, Eli Pariser’s notion that personalization-driven algorithmic systems help silo people into segregated content streams. Facebook’s claim that content personalization plays a small role in shaping what people see compared with their own choices is accurate, so they have every right to be annoyed. I couldn’t imagine Time Warner being blamed for who watches Duck Dynasty v Modern Family .\nAnd yet what Facebook does do is mirror and magnify a trend that’s been unfolding in the US for the last 20 years: a trend of self-segregation that is enabled by technology in all sorts of complicated ways.\nThe US can only function as a healthy democracy if we find a way to diversify our social connections, if we find a way to weave together a strong social fabric that bridges ties across difference. Right now, we are moving in the opposite direction with serious consequences.\nTwo contemporary trend lines can help us understand this.\nPrivatizing the military: a blow to the diversification America’s social fabric The voluntary US military is, in many ways, a social engineering project.\nThe public understands the military as a service organization, dedicated to protecting the country’s interests. Yet when recruits sign up, they are promised training and job opportunities. Individual motivations vary tremendously, but many are enticed by the opportunity to travel the world, participate in a cause with a purpose, and get the heck out of Dodge.\nEveryone expects basic training to be physically hard, but few recognize that some of the most grueling aspects of signing up have to do with the diversification project that is central to the formation of the American military.\nWhen a soldier is in combat, she must trust her fellow soldiers with her life. And she must be willing to do what it takes to protect the rest of her unit. In order to make that possible, the military must wage war on prejudice. This is not an easy task: plenty of generals fought hard to fight racial desegregation and to limit the role of women in combat.\nSgt. Jennifer Pirante/US Marine Corps\nYet the US military was desegregated in 1948, six years before Brown v Board of Education forced desegregation of schools. And the supreme court ruled that LGBT individuals could openly serve in the military before they could legally marry.\nMorale is often proposed as the main reason soldiers should not be forced to entrust their lives to people who are different from them. Yet time and again, this justification collapses under broader interests to grow the military.\nAs a result, commanders are forced to find ways to build up morale across difference, to actively seek to break down barriers to teamwork, and to help a group of people whose demographics, values, politics and ideologies are as varied as the country’s jell. In the process, they build one of the most crucial social infrastructures of the country. They build the diverse social fabric that underpins democracy.\nTons of money was poured into defense after 9/11, but the number of people serving in the US military today is far lower than it was throughout the 1980s. Why?\nStarting in the 1990s and accelerating after 9/11, the US privatized huge chunks of the military. This means that private contractors and their employees play critical roles in everything, from providing food services to equipment maintenance to military housing.\nThe impact of this on the role of the military in society is significant. For example, it undermines recruits’ ability to get training to develop critical skills that will be essential in civilian life. Instead, while serving on active duty, they spend much more time on the frontlines and in high-risk battle, increasing the likelihood that they will be physically or psychologically harmed. The impact on skills development and job opportunities is tremendous, but so is the impact on the diversification of the social fabric.\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nPrivate vendors are not engaged in the same social engineering project as the military and, as a result, tend to hire and fire people based on their ability to work effectively as a team. Like many companies, they have little incentive to invest in helping diverse teams learn to work together as effectively as possible.\nBuilding diverse teams – especially ones in which members depend on each other for their survival – is extremely hard, time-consuming, and emotionally exhausting. As a result, private companies focus on “culture fit”, emphasize teams that get along, and look for people who already have the necessary skills, all of which helps reinforce existing segregation patterns.\nThe result is that, in the last 20 years, we’ve watched one of our major structures for diversification collapse without anyone taking notice. And because of how it’s happened, the process is also connected to job opportunities and economic opportunity for many working- and middle-class individuals, seeding resentment and hatred.\nA self-segregated college life If you ask a college admissions officer at an elite institution to describe how they build a class of incoming freshmen, you will quickly realize that the American college system is a diversification project.\nUnlike colleges in most parts of the world, the vast majority of freshmen at top-tier universities in the US live on campus with roommates who are assigned to them. Colleges approach housing assignments as an opportunity to pair diverse strangers with one another to build social ties.\nThis makes sense given how many friendships emerge out of freshman dorms. By pairing middle-class kids with students from wealthier families, elite institutions help diversify the elites of the future.\nMembers of the graduating class of 2013 attend their graduation ceremony at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, May 19, 2013. REUTERS/Jason Reed\nThis diversification project produces a tremendous amount of conflict. Although plenty of people adore their college roommates and relish the opportunity to get to know people from different walks of life as part of their college experience, there is an amazing amount of angst about dorm assignments and the troubles that brew once folks try to live together in close quarters.\nAt many universities, residential life is often in the business of student therapy as students complain about their roommates and dorm-mates.\nYet just like in the military, learning how to negotiate conflict and diversity in close quarters can be tremendously effective in weaving the social fabric.\nIn the spring of 2006, I was doing fieldwork with teenagers at a time when they had just received acceptances to college. I giggled at how many of them immediately wrote to the college in which they intended to enroll, begging for a campus email address so that they could join Facebook through the school (before Facebook was broadly available).\nIn the previous year, I had watched the previous class look up roommate assignments on MySpace so I was prepared for the fact that they’d use Facebook to do the same. What I wasn’t prepared for was how quickly they would all get on Facebook, map the incoming freshman class, and use this information to ask for a roommate switch.\nBefore they even arrived on campus in August or September, they had self-segregated as much as possible.\nFlickr / Nazareth College\nA few years later, I watched another trend hit: cellphones. While these were touted as tools that allowed students to stay connected to parents (which prompted many faculty to complain about “helicopter parents” arriving on campus), they really ended up serving as a crutch to address homesickness, as incoming students focused on maintaining ties to high school friends rather than building new relationships.\nStudents go to elite universities to “get an education”. Few realize that the true quality product that elite colleges in the US have historically offered is social network diversification. Even when it comes to job acquisition, sociologists have long known that diverse social networks (“weak ties”) are what increase job prospects. By self-segregating on campus, students undermine their own potential while also helping fragment the diversity of the broader social fabric.\nDiversity is hard Diversity is often touted as highly desirable. Indeed, in professional contexts, we know that more diverse teams often outperform homogeneous teams. Diversity also increases cognitive development, both intellectually and socially. And yet actually encountering and working through diverse viewpoints, experiences, and perspectives is hard work. It’s uncomfortable. It’s emotionally exhausting. It can be downright frustrating.\nGlobal Peace Foundation\nThus, given the opportunity, people typically revert to situations where they can be in homogeneous environments. They look for “safe spaces” and “culture fit”. Systems that are “personalized” are highly desirable. Most people aren’t looking to self-segregate, but they do it anyway.\nIncreasingly, the technologies and tools around us allow us to self-segregate with ease.

Here are some recommendations.\nBy and large, the American public wants to have strong connections across divisions. They see the value in it, politically and socially. But they’re not going to work for it. And given the option, they’re going to renew their license remotely, try to get out of jury duty, and use available data to seek out housing and schools that are filled with people like them.\nThis is the conundrum we now face.\nMany pundits remarked that, during the 2016 election season, very few Americans were regularly exposed to people whose political ideology conflicted with their own . This is true. But it cannot be fixed by Facebook or the news media. Exposing people to content that challenges their perspective doesn’t actually make them more empathetic to those values and perspectives. To the contrary, it polarizes them.\nWhat makes people willing to hear difference is knowing and trusting people whose worldview differs from their own. Exposure to content cannot make up for self-segregation.\nIf we want to develop a healthy democracy, we need a diverse and highly connected social fabric. This requires creating contexts in which the American public voluntarily struggles with the challenges of diversity to build bonds that will last a lifetime.\nWe have been systematically undoing this, and the public has used new technological advances to make their lives easier by self-segregating. This has increased polarization, and we’re going to pay a heavy price. Rather than focusing on what media enterprises can and should do, we need to focus instead on building new infrastructures for connection where people have a reason to come together across divisions. We need that social infrastructure just as much as we need bridges and roads.\nNOW WATCH: Airplane designers have a brilliant idea for the middle seat US Politics Race Issues Diversity U.S. Military Social Media Segregation The Guardian", "external_links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook", "https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles", "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/facebook-bias-bubble-us-election-conservative-liberal-news-feed", "https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf", "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/08/eli-pariser-activist-whose-filter-bubble-warnings-presaged-trump-and-brexit"], "published": "2017-01-14T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:20:32.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
