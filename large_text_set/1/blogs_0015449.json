We have to be so serious on the subject of protecting our nation’s secrets, and so we’ll register strong disagreement with that,” Pence added. \nPence said President-elect Donald Trump and his team are “committed to protecting our nation’s secrets” and would “bring to bear the law” on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange if he surrenders to U.S. authorities. \nIn discussing the role of WikiLeaks in the 2016 presidential campaign, Pence noted that there is a distinction to be made between whether information is useful and the means used to obtain it.
