Making a style statement (as always), Anushka appeared on The Kapil Sharma Show yesterday looking as cute as a shiny new button. Wearing a print-heavy, cold-shoulder top, Ms. Sharma seamlessly combined a blue and white stripe skirt. Anushka Sharma \nWe absolutely love that she chose this miss-matched pairing; the high-waisted, calf-lenght skirt worked wonders as it gave the colourful top a chic and super fun vibe. She finished the look off with tan and orange heels! What a fun look, right? \nEven Mr. Labrador seems to love it. You? Anushka Sharma \nWant a similar printed top? 109", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:16:08.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
