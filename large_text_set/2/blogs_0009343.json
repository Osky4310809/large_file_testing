Fulfilling. Maybe with ketchup.\nWe’re talking about burgers, obviously. But also sex toys, because why can’t you have both?\nWhy is there sometimes a massive leaf in your burrito? Israeli Burger King is giving us what we’ve all been eagerly waiting for, finally combining the joy of a fast food meal with added sex appeal.\nFor Valentine’s Day only, they’ll be selling special Adults Meal boxes.\nLike a Happy Meal, Burger King’s Adults Meal is a nice fast food meal neatly packaged in a box.\nBut instead of a children’s toy, this one has an adult toy. Meaning sex stuff.\n\nEach box will contain two Whoppers, two packs of french fries, two beers, and a ‘romantic adult toy’.\nBurger King has kept an element of sensual mystery by not specifying exactly what these different adult toys may be, but the promotional videos and pictures show a blindfold, a feather tickler, and a head massager.\nSadly, Burger King have not gone full Burger Kink, and we don’t think they’ll be offering nipple clamps or vibrators. What a shame.\nBurger King Israel's Adults Meal for Valentine's Day comes with an unspecified \"adult\" toy #fastfood #burger pic.twitter.com/BYU95ZHxC1 \n— Aaron Jourden (@SplitsAtoms) February 13, 2017 \n\nThe boxes will only be available on Tuesday 14 February after 6pm, and only those who are over the age of 18 will be able to buy them. Wise.\nAnd, as we mentioned, this is only an offer in Israel.\nBut if you have your heart set on a sensual fast fry fueled romp, we’d recommend just nipping to Burger King on your way home, picking up a load of burgers, then making a stop in Ann Summers before your nuggets get cold.
