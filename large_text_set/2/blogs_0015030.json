WATCH: Witness Says Cops Targeted Sophia Wilansky Before Blowing Up Her Arm Published Updated 6:30 am EST, November 28, 2016 24 Comments By Jennifer Dzikowski 9.1k Share Tweet Follow \nProtesters of the North Dakota Access Pipeline, along with people from around the world are outraged that Sophia Wilansky ‘s arm was blown up November 20 during a confrontation with police. \nAdding fuel to the fire, one witness, in the video above, blames the police and believes Wilansky was actually targeted by authorities. \nWayne Wilansky, the 21-one-year-old woman’s father, said his daughter was wounded in a concussion grenade blast that “blew the bone out of her arm.” \n“On November 21st as a direct result of the violent police response at Standing Rock towards unarmed people opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 21 year old woman from New York City, Sophia Wilansky, was severely injured when a concussion grenade thrown by police hit her left arm and exploded,” a statement from The Standing Rock Medic & Healing Council stated. “Sophia was heading to bring water to the unarmed people who were being attacked for several hours by Morton County Sheriff forces. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department has stated that she was injured by a purported propane explosion that the Sheriff’s Department claimed the unarmed people created. These statements are refuted by Sophia’s testimony, by several eye-witnesses who watched police intentionally throw concussion grenades at unarmed people, by the lack of charring of flesh at the wound site and by the grenade pieces that have been removed from her arm in surgery and will be saved for legal proceedings.” \nYou can see photos of Wilansky’s injuries below. Please note that they are graphic in nature:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:20:26.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
