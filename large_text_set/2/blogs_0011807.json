However, as Bored Panda reports , online art community Today Is Art Day decided to take historic liberties in the name of nerdy fun and created a mini van Gogh action figure, complete with two completely detachable ears. \nToday Is Art Day developed a prototype of the 5-inch PVC figurine, and to bring it to the art-loving masses, they launched a Kickstarter campaign. Backers who contribute $28 Canadian dollars (around $21 USD) can score their own van Gogh action figure. He even comes in a box decorated with miniature, cut-out replicas of one of his Sunflowers paintings (1888) and The Starry Night (1889). \nThe campaign ends on March 16 and orders will be shipped by July 2017.
