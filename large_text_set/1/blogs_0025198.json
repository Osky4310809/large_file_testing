The 27-year-old linebacker signed a four-year, $50 million extension with $26 million in guarantees.\nThere were reports earlier this week that Cleveland was going to get a deal done with the veteran linebacker by the weekend. \nThe Browns have made significant progress on an extension with pending free-agent Jamie Collins, sources said. Deal to be done by weekend\n— Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) January 20, 2017 The Browns will have $107.46 million in cap space to spend this offseason, so the team definitely had enough money to sign Collins to a huge contract. Now that Cleveland singed him to this extension, it will now have the chance to possibly franchise tag receiver Terrelle Pryor, according to Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com. \nEven though Cleveland went 1-15 in 2016, Collins said he would return if “the money is right.” \nCollins was scheduled to become a free agent this offseason, but Cleveland decided that his performance with the team was enough to sign him to a long-term deal. The one-time Pro Bowl er was acquired from the New England Patriots for a third-round pick one day before the trading deadline. \nThis was a shocking trade because Collins was performing at an elite level during his time in Foxborough. The veteran linebacker was coming off of a Pro Bowl season and was a great player on the Patriots’ defense. \nIn eight games with the Browns, Collins registered 69 tackles and two sacks. He is an every-down linebacker who can make plays while defending the run and pass.\nCleveland has a lot of cap space to use during the free agency period, so it wanted to use a lot of that money to sign one of the best linebackers in football. Collins could be the leader of this defense, and former Browns defensive coordinator Ray Horton praised the 27-year-old linebacker.\n“ Jamie's a former quarterback. He sees the whole field. He understands what he's looking at. He understands splits. He understands plays, and he's a guy that loves football. He's opening up (to his teammates), and he is very encouraging out on the field.” \nFollowing the 2016 season, Cleveland decided to part ways with Horton. The Browns had the 31st ranked defense and surrendered 28.3 points per game. \nThe Browns decided to hire Gregg Williams to become the team’s defensive coordinator. He spent the last three years with the St. Louis/ Los Angeles Rams . Collins could be a good fit in Williams’ 4-3 defensive scheme.\nWilliams likes to dial up the blitz, and Collins is a talented pass rusher. This was a move Cleveland felt it had to make. \nCollins contract extension is the first of many moves in the Browns rebuilding phase. During the season, they stockpiled draft picks and traded for Collins. Cleveland also has the first and 12th pick in this year’s draft, setting up a huge offseason for Cleveland. \nWhile Collins played at a high level in the past, he was never considered to be among the elite linebackers who is now getting paid more than.\nIndeed, Collins deserves a contract extension, but it’s a risk for the Browns to pay him more than the top-notch linebackers after only one great year. Time will tell if this move will work out for Cleveland, but for now, the Browns have a solid linebacker to build around. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:59:44.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
