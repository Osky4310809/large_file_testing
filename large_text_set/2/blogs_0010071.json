Happy Birthday, President Lincoln! pic.twitter.com/W2rXcKHVpu \n— GOP (@GOP) February 12, 2017 \n\nAbraham Lincoln greeted this earth on February 12, 1809. As one does, the Republican party celebrated the 208th anniversary of this momentous occasion with a tweeted tribute. Unfortunately, the quote that they chose — “And in the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years” — was not only bland in comparison to anything they could have used, but it’s also a fake quote . As always, Jake Tapper was on the case and pointed out, “There is no evidence that Abraham Lincoln ever said this.”\nThere is no evidence that Abraham Lincoln ever said this. https://t.co/3AHyxWDghy https://t.co/z4y5m9J45Z \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 12, 2017 \n\nYeah, that’s pretty embarrassing. Folks were already having a Sunday joy fest after the Department of Education misspelled W.E.B. Du Bois’ name . Yet that was a tiny mistake in comparison to misattributing a quote to the 16th president, especially since Donald Trump and Paul Ryan take great pleasure in claiming that Republicans inhabit “the party of Lincoln.” \nNaturally, this fake quote launched a meme with some terrifically funny responses. There were definitely more than four score and seven jokes at play, but we’re not posting that many. Instead, here are some highlights — beginning with the obligatory quote from Omar in The Wire .\n\n@GOP pic.twitter.com/59LftcZdEN \n— T.
