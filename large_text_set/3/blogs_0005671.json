The universe has finally given in to your unceasing demands, and bequeathed more Barb onto the world. (Or more Shannon Purser, in any case.) Purser—who played the dowdy-but-doomed voice of reason on Netflix’s summer hit— has been cast in NBC’s upcoming teen soap Drama High , in a recurring part that was written specifically for her. \nBased on Michael Sokolove’s non-fiction book of the same name, the series centers on a high school drama department run by “a passionate teacher and family man whose dedication to the program galvanizes the entire town.” Purser will play Annabelle, a young actress swept up in this flurry of inspirational storytelling tropes. She joins a cast that includes Rosie Perez, Moana ’ s Auli’i Cravalho, and Rarmian Newton, while Friday Night Lights showrunner Jason Katims and Hamilton’ s Jeffrey Seller will executive produce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:05:48.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
