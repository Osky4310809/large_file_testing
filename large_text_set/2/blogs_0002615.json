It carries the caption: “America First.” \nIt followed a series of attacks on Berlin’s policies by Trump and his aides that have marked a rapid deterioration in German relations with the US. \n“Der Spiegel does not want to provoke anybody,” editor-in-chief Klaus Brinkbaeumer told Reuters after the cover set off a debate on Twitter and in German and international media, adding he was surprised by the impact of the illustration. \n“We want to show what this is about, it’s about democracy, it’s about freedom, it’s about freedom of the press, freedom of justice and all that is seriously endangered,” he said. “So we are defending democracy … Are these serious times? Yes they are.” \nAlexander Graf Lambsdorff, a member of Germany’s Free Democrats (FDP) and vice-president of the European Parliament, described the cover as “tasteless”.
