Got it! \nClick the heart, it's called favoriting. Favorite the stuff you like. Got it! ✉ Email \nLast week, while Icelandic president Guðni Th. Jóhannesson was visiting a high school in northern Iceland, one brazen student asked him whether he liked pineapples on his pizza. (I have no idea why this student asked him this question.) He responded passionately and quickly, saying he’d ban it if he could. If he had the power, he’d ban it throughout the whole country, he told the student. ♥ + Hello? Is That You, Deep Dish Pizza? by Erin McDowell \nScary! As the internet got wind of this yesterday, a mildly amusing debate pivoting around this divisive question blossomed on Twitter: Does pineapple belong on pizza?

I would not want to hold this position if I could pass laws forbidding what I don't like,” he wrote in both Icelandic and English. “I would not want to live in such a country.\" Agreed, Mr. President. I wouldn’t want to live there, either. \nPineapple on pizza: Love it? Hate it? Let us know in the comments.
