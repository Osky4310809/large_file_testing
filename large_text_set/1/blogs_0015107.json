They’ve recorded an acoustic cover of “Let Me In,” R.E.M.’s Monster track dedicated to the late Kurt Cobain. Band leader Kenny Becker offered this statement: \nI always thought this song was one of the more haunting and mournfully poetic tributes to Kurt Cobain. The tragedy of having lost a true friend is really apparent in R.E.M.’s version. I had always been very moved by that so I tried making my own jangly-acoustic version. \nListen below. \nGoon have some tour dates coming up: \n01/18 Los Angeles, CA @ The Echo 01/20 San Francisco, CA @ Garden of Weeden 01/21 Portland, OR @ The Boathouse 01/24 Tacoma, WA @ Real Art Tacoma 01/25 Spokane, WA @ The Observatory 01/27 Vancouver, BC @ Studio Vostok 01/28 Seattle, WA @ Victory Lounge 01/29 Portland OR @ Twilight Lounge 01/31 Sacramento, CA @ Press Club 03/15-17 Austin, TX @ SXSW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T19:58:57.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
