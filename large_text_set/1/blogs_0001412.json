No one was injured. \nMatthew G. Beers, 22, of Mount Pleasant, was taken into custody without incident at a Sheetz on Route 119 in Bullskin, police said. \nAuthorities said Mr. Beers fled after ramming a pickup stolen out of Connellsville into a house on Pleasant Valley Road. Around 6:30 p.m., he went to another house blocks away and stole a vehicle out of a garage, damaging the garage door. Police said Mr. Beers crashed that car a “short distance” away. \nMinutes later he got into a vehicle at a house back near where he crashed the first car. The homeowner noticed him and Mr. Beers ran off, police said. \nPolice continued searching for him but Mr. Beers showed up minutes later at the Sheetz and was taken into custody.
