One of those looks to be the One X10, which has been pictured ahead of its official debut. The device is likely to get an unveiling at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona later this week.\nLike last year’s One X9 , the One X10 appears to have a curved aluminum unibody. Its display glass extends to cover its entire front side, much like the flagship HTC 10, and there’s a rear-facing fingerprint scanner on its back. Its predecessor did not have a fingerprint scanner, so users had to rely on passcodes and patterns for security.\nInstead of a physical home button, the X10 has three capacitive keys that sit beneath its display. According to previous rumors, the device could have a 5.5-inch 1080p display, an octa-core MediaTek processor, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of internal storage. It is also expected to offer a 16.3-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 7.9-megapixel selfie camera.\nGiven that the X10 in this photo has its regulatory markings and a branded screen protector, it looks like the handset is close to making its official debut. HTC is likely to announce it at MWC, which kicks off on Sunday, February 26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:30:35.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
