They said the main point was to drive across the point that humans can beat their inner demons. \n“I found compassion for my less than perfect waistline,” Smith (sophomore-health policy and administration) said. \nA question and answer session followed the discussion, with several audience members asking questions related to advice for body positivity and how to write a memoir. \nOne of the audience members asked each of the participating girls in the Body Monologues to say something they liked about themselves; some of them stating outward beauty traits such as their eyes or hair and others said they loved their mind. \n“We need to choose to respect and love ourselves first,” Judge (junior-biobehavioral health) said. \nMaddy Galascio said she first noticed a change in her body during her sophomore year of high school. She said she wasn’t happy with the way she looked and would often cry. \n“I hope students realize they aren't in the battle alone if they do have an eating disorder or struggle with their body image in some way,” Stacy Jones, producer of the Body Monologues, said. \nAt the end of the performance, each participating girl stood in the front of the stage and bowed to a room full of clapping and supporting students. \n“I am positive, I am kind, I am beautiful— and so are you,” Smith said.
