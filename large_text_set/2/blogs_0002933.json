For the designers behind Joe Fresh Goods, a Chicago-based streetwear brand, it’s with a fashion blogger-ready \"Thank You Obama\" Collection. The limited-edition collection pays homage to the 44th president with some sick graphic art, fresh twists on iconic Americana (think classic jerseys and an Ivy League–worthy “Malia” tee), and even an airbrushed tee paying tribute to Barack and Michelle’s blessed union (you can also get some “f*ck Donald\" swag if you’re so inclined). The unisex collection, which initially sold out on thankuobama.us , is currently on back order thanks to its overwhelming popularity.

Naturally, we envision it would be a high-low collaboration of up-and-coming American designers and foreign brands capturing the message of globalization and inclusivity that Michelle used to make her mark.
