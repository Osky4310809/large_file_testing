Then the unelected house, would not, should not and could not do so.\" \nLord Lisvane, who is from Cardiff, said the Brexit Bill debate in the Commons had achieved what it should do by an exposure of the issues with ministers having to defend their position. \nHowever, Lord Lisvane - who as Sir Robert Rogers served as clerk to the House of Commons from 2011-2014 - said peers might take the opportunity to ask MPs to \"think again\" on the position of EU nationals resident in the UK. \nDozens of peers are expected to speak for and against the UK government's plans in the two-day debate. \nTheresa May wants to trigger the formal Brexit talks with the EU by the end of March. The full interview can be heard on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme at 08:00 GMT on 19 February.
