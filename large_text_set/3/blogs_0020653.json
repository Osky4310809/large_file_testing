Today's treasure came in the form of @BeastModeGrandma, by way of #GrandmasWhoLift (yes, it's a thing; no, don't ask us how we got there).\nAnd my 37kg snatch. Neither of my clean lifts were as heavy or as good technically as I would have liked. I do know what I have to improve and the longer I keep at it the better I will get ðŸ˜Š @bodyimagemovement @thegirlsgonestrong\nA post shared by beastmodegrandma (@beastmodegrandma) on Mar 21, 2017 at 12:07pm PDT\nBMG is actually 62-year-old Sue, self-proclaimed \"fitness convert\" who \"loves to lift heavy stuff.\" The 'grams you see before you are just a couple jewels in the treasure trove that is her account. Apparently Sue started her journey about four years ago, and fitness changed her life. She has impeccable taste in pants and she's strong as hell!\nFeeling Pretty Grateful Today ! Life is full of Surprises... For me probably the biggest ones are connected to the seemingly unending opportunities and support I have received, and am receiving for the pursuit of my goals. All because I made that one small change just over 4 years ago that started with a change in mindset and linked me to so many amazing and generous people. This really is an Amazing Freight Train of Awesomeness I am on !
