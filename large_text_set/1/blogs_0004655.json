Proton Iriz spotted in Indonesia – launching soon? / 1 comment \nProton has talked up exports of the Iriz for some time, but so far it has yet to happen. However, Indonesian auto portal AutoNetMagz.com has managed to scour photos of the B-segment hatchback in Jakarta, which hints of an impending launch in the archipelago. \nThe Atlantic Blue unit was spotted at a hotel with its badges taped up, but was otherwise undisguised. By all appearances, this is the base 1.3 Standard manual model, judging by the black door mirrors and handles, as well as the lack of a bodykit, front fog lights and rear wiper. \nThe interior is standard, ahem, Standard fare as well, with a Bluetooth-equipped head unit and a non-multifunction steering wheel, although the angular gearknob on Malaysian-spec cars has been replaced by a round one from cars like the Savvy and Satria Neo. \nUnder the bonnet is almost certainly the 94 hp/120 Nm 1.3 litre VVT engine mated to a five-speed manual, just like we get over here. Expect specifications and equipment to mirror those offered over here, although it is rumoured that Indonesians could receive a 1.3 Premium CVT model that isn’t available in Malaysia. \nProton’s Indonesian arm has been quiet for some time now, with the last car introduced being the Suprima S in 2013. The Iriz was apparently slated to be launched in May 2015 , then was reported to have undergone type approval that October. Could this be the year the Iriz finally makes it to Indonesia?
