Ronaldinho releases new single 'Sozinho' (Photo: Instagram/ronaldinho) \nHe also sang in the official Rio Paralympics song in 2016. \nBut this is the first time Ronaldinho has released a song on his own. When he released his song, Ronaldinho said: \"Thank you my friends. This is my first song, with no composition partner!!!\" \nIt's a fair effort from the Brazilian. Ronaldinho was recently made a FC Barcelona ambassador (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nThe title of the song literally translates to 'Alone' and is sang in the soft samba genre. \nSome of the lyrics are as follows: \"Me, now alone. I do not feel weaker, or stronger. But who knows the luck. Comfort me in this battle.\" \nIt's clearly a very emotional and personal song from the former Ballon d'Or winner. Let's hope for something more upbeat going forward. poll loading Did you like Ronaldinho's debut song? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T18:45:37.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
