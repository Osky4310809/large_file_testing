Kia’s full-size sedan offers a long list of standard and optional features along with the brand’s signature value pricing and an unbeatable warranty . Its cabin is well-built and comfortable , and the Cadenza is a rolling technology showcase , wrapping up the best of Kia’s gear in one handsome package. Performance isn’t showstopping, but lap times aren’t important when your only intention is to arrive with style. What’s New for 2017? \nThe Cadenza is all new for 2017 and marks Kia’s sophomore effort for a full-size near-luxury car. Completely redesigned from bumper to bumper, the sharper Cadenza has a sleek interior and modern technologies such as Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and an available head-up display. The 3.3-liter V-6 engine has been retuned for better fuel economy and pairs to a new eight-speed automatic transmission. For the first time, the Cadenza offers a full suite of active safety technology. Trims and Options We’d Choose \nThe Cadenza is extremely well-equipped even in its base Premium trim, but we recommend the midrange Technology model for $7000 more. At $39,890, it comes with all of the modern and luxury items you’d expect, plus some you might not, including: \n• Panoramic sunroof• 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment with navigation• 12-speaker Harman/Kardon audio• Proximity approach lighting \nThe Technology trim lives up to its name by offering all of Kia’s active safety gear as standard.
