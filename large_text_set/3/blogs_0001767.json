HTC CEO, Peter Chou, is desperately seeking 45-year-old biker Will the real Nokia 3310 please stand up? \nDuring this week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, HMD Global Oy introduced a modernized version of the Nokia 3310 mobile phone (pictured). \n“The icon is back,” according to the Finnish manufacturer (with rights to market phones under the Nokia brand). And so is its noughties price tag: For €49 ($52), you can play Snake all day every day for up to a month. \nBased on the silhouette of the original, the new Nokia 3310 has been reimagined for 2017—with 2.4-inch polarized and curved screen, long-lasting battery (up to 22 hours of talk time), 2-megapixel camera, 2G connectivity, 16MB storage, and a MicroSD card for up to 32GB additional cache. It comes in four colors: red or yellow gloss finish, and dark blue or grey matte. \nSnake Xenzia (HMD Global)\nThe candy bar handset is enough to give you flashbacks to the millennium when Facebook was no more than a spark in Mark Zuckerberg’s eye and people still read newspapers on the daily train commute. HMD has injected a full dose of nostalgia into the new 3310, though, with the time-honored Nokia font and a revamped version of the video game Snake—replaced by Gameloft’s “Snake Xenzia” with updated modes and graphics. \nLooking for something a little more … contemporary? HMD Global also introduced three Android-based smartphones: Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and Nokia 6. \nNokia 3 (HMD Global)\nWith 8-megapixel autofocus camera on the front and rear and LTE 4G connectivity, the 5-inch Nokia 3 features 16GB of storage (with room for up to 128GB more via MicroSD) for €139 ($147). \nNokia 5 (HMD Global)\nFor about $50 more, you can get the 5.2-inch display, 13-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel front shooter, and fingerprint sensor of the Nokia 5 (€189/$200). \nNokia 6 (HMD Global)\nThe high-end Nokia 6 , set to retail for €229 ($243), boasts a 5.5-inch full-HD display, 16-megapixel back camera, dual speakers, the latest-gen Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor, 3GB of RM, up to 32GB mass storage, and a 3,000 mAh battery. \nRelease dates have not been announced; interested buyers can sign up online to find out when the new Nokia phones hit shelves. \nFor more Mobile World Congress coverage, check out our pals at PCMag .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T15:02:56.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
