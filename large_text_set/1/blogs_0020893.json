Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Trump on Monday ordered an across-the-board employment freeze for the federal government, halting hiring for all new and existing positions except those in national security, public safety and the military. In the two-page order, Mr. Trump said the directive is a stopgap way to control the growth of government until his budget director recommends a long-term plan to significantly reduce the federal work force through attrition. “In carrying out this memorandum, I ask that you seek efficient use of existing personnel and funds to improve public services and the delivery of these services,” Mr. Trump wrote in the memorandum, one of his first acts as president. “Accordingly, this memorandum does not prohibit making reallocations to meet the highest priority needs and to ensure that essential services are not interrupted and national security is not affected.” The largest public employees union blasted the president’s action, saying it will force federal agencies to rely on more expensive contractors to deliver the services that Americans have come to expect from the government. “This hiring freeze will mean longer lines at Social Security offices, fewer workplace safety inspections, less oversight of environmental polluters and greater risk to our nation’s food supply and clean water systems,” said J. David Cox Sr., the president of the group, the American Federation of Government Employees. \nAdvertisement Continue   Mr. Trump’s memorandum addressed that point directly by saying that “contracting outside the government to circumvent the intent of this memorandum shall not be permitted.” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Monday that the president’s decision to freeze hiring was the result of a desire to show greater care for taxpayers’ money. “What the president’s showing through the hiring freeze, first and foremost today, is that we’ve got to respect the American taxpayer,” he told reporters in his first briefing at the White House.
