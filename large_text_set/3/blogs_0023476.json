Read more Russian ambassador calls UK ‘reserved area’ for criminals \nThe embassy accuses the UK of hypocrisy, saying it harbors a significant number of criminals wanted by Russian prosecutors, whilst at the same time condemning Moscow’s attitude to the rule of law. \nA 2015 corporate report by the British Foreign Office titled ‘ Russia - Country of Concern ’ claimed that “ the rule of law in Russia remained inconsistent and arbitrarily applied. ” \n“Concerns about the impartiality of courts, corruption and poor prison conditions were ongoing,” the report stated. \nHowever, the Russian embassy dismissed the accusations as “ dubious ” and “ agenda-driven ” tactics. A massive anti-corruption drive was launched by the Russian government last year, which saw the country’s economy minister, Aleksey Ulyukayev, placed under arrest. \nAt the same time, the embassy pointed out that the British government has refused to extradite 51 Russian citizens wanted on criminal charges in Russia from 2002 to 2016, and “ dozens of cases are still pending. ” \nIn many instances, the refusal to extradite the criminals was made simply by the personal decision of the UK home secretary without any legal proceedings. \nThe British government often does not provide reasons for refusing to extradite these individuals, beyond a general “ protection of human rights ” argument. \nThe embassy, however, emphasized that the extradition requests are accompanied by detailed information on the nature of the criminal charges as well as numerous guarantees by the Russian authorities that all rights of these individuals will be respected under domestic and international law. \n“ London prefers to keep ignoring real expert opinions, even by British experts, as well as written guarantees by the Russian side, ” the embassy’s report stated.
