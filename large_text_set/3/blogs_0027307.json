Oshiomhole \nThis comes as Governor Godwin Obaseki commended the former governor for the foundation he laid in the state in the educational sector, assuring that the state government will build on it so as to take education to the next level in the state. \nSpeaking on why he established the university while he was governor, Oshiomhole narrated that ,“ I had a conversation with members of the state House of Assembly and the current governor, Godwin Obaseki who was chairman of the Economic Team then. I told them that it is always easy for us to lament that the country is not good ,but yet we do nothing to change it. So it was in that conversation that we decided to build a university that has the right environment for teaching, learning and research. \n“And that university should not just be another university. It must have facilities that will enable lecturers to teach and students to learn. And our lecture rooms should not admit more than one hundred students in a room. I am glad that I was able to provide this initial facility in this university. \nThe whole idea is that rather than go to Ghana, Europe or US; can we not bring those qualities here, what does it take to do it…. The first was to have the political will to do what is right and the second is to have the courage to tell everybody to contribute its part.” \nExplaining that the university was established for both the rich and indigent students, Oshiomhole said, “the university must allocate a percentage of the spaces available for indigent students who must be sponsored by government and covered for by the grant that the government is providing for the university. And to ensure that every part of Edo State has a space here, that scholarship must be such that in each of the 18 Local governments we must have brilliant students that will pass well organized exams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T04:44:50.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
