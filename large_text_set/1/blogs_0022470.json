Just a week after Bruno Mars played the show three years ago, his album Unorthodox Jukebox flew from No. 7 to No. 3 on the Billboard 200, according to Forbes . Meanwhile, Beyoncé’s album 4 shot up 59 per cent right after her performance the year before Bruno. Shame: The Born This Way hitmaker won't be paid a penny for putting on a much-anticipated show to millions on February 5 Star-studded: Last year, 111.9M viewers tuned in to watch the halftime show headlined by Coldplay with supporting acts Beyoncé and Bruno Mars And Lady Gaga discussed what an incredible opportunity the gig is in a new behind-the-scenes video released last week by Pepsi. 'This is obviously a humongous platform,' she began. 'This is probably the greatest 12 minutes of our lives. Longtime choreographer Richy Jackson, Gaga added: 'We have handpicked dancers that Gaga and I have worked with for the past 10 years. 'This sort of platform that we have at the NFL halftime show goes to those who have helped us along the way to get here. So it’s going to be like a big reunion.' Making it rain: The six-time Grammy winner will not be given a traditional fee, but will be covered for all her production expenses It comes as Gaga is reportedly cooking up quite a stunt for her Super Bowl LI halftime show airing live February 5 on Fox. According to Page Six , the 30-year-old pop diva literally wants to sing from the top of NRG Stadium's 260ft-high dome in Houston. The Texas stadium has a state-of-the-art, sheer, retractable 'fabric roof' that opens in seven minutes. She might have to be airlifted for the dangerous rooftop stunt, and her team is worried about the technical difficulties involved. 'Trying to figure out insurance for it is crazy,' a source told the mag. 'They're writing up multiple plans about how to safely get her on the roof, including potentially [cutting] a hole in the ceiling of the dome.' Scarlet siren: Lady Gaga performed during Super Bowl 50 between the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara last year Giving it her all: She gave an impassioned performance in a red glittery pantsuit Gaga built a tent in her backyard with a dance floor so she could better rehearse her Americana-inspired concert with her dancers. It wouldn't be her first outlandish feat having been hoisted high in the air for her 2009 MTV VMAs show and her GMA Central Park performance in 2011. The A Million Reasons singer also took flight in a high-tech propeller dress called 'Volantis' for her artRave at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 2013. Last year, Lady Gaga kicked off the 2016 football festivities by belting the National Anthem in a glittery red pantsuit. Fans can expect the A-Yo songstress to perform a 'Monster' medley of her hits throughout her decade-long career as well as singles from her latest effort, Joanne.
