(Photo: Luke Sharrett, Bloomberg) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThere’s a phrase I’ve used often over the past several weeks — “The future ain’t what it used to be.” After my first full month serving as administrator to the Environmental Protection Agency, there’s no question times are changing, and last week we saw yet another example of how our president continues to lead the way. \nAuto manufacturing continues to be one of the driving forces in the American economy, accounting for 3% of our GDP . Forty-five states have 10,000 or more auto jobs. Automakers and their suppliers employ more than 3.5 million Americans. The American people clearly want it to stay that way. \nPresident Trump promised to fight to keep auto manufacturing jobs here in the United States, and he has asked his entire Cabinet to help. \nDepartment of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and I, as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, took steps to help. We have announced that we will revisit the previous administration’s rule that finalized standards to increase fuel economy to the equivalent of 54.5 mpg for cars and light-duty trucks by Model Year 2025. \nEPA will work with our partners at DOT to take a fresh look. This thorough review will help ensure that this national program is good for consumers and good for the environment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:05:53.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
