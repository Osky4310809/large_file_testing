It didn’t claim that throne through weird eugenics memes but through intelligent business practices and a sterling record of quality products. Valve operates at such a high level that the dude the company hired to help with economics only left to go help turn Greece around . Valve is even responsible for some of the dankest Shrek content out there! And when Gabe Newell and friends do screw up, they quickly right the ship. Steam’s launch wasn’t perfect, but it’s now a de facto monopoly for PC game digital distribution. Meanwhile, Steam.com is something totally different .\nBut what happens when Valve fails and instead of fixing the problem the company just lets it fade away? If you don’t know what I’m talking about let me bring up a product you probably haven’t thought about in over a year. Remember Steam Machines?\n\nValve’s master plan to disrupt the gaming console market first came to light in 2012. That’s when, after months of speculation, the company confirmed it was considering making a line of gaming PCs meant to be played at home combining the ease of consoles with the power and flexibility of computers. It was exciting news. If any company had the power to totally upend the existing, post-Microsoft hardware status quo, it was Valve.\nIn the years following news slowly but surely trickled out. Valve (in)famously loves to take its time with its work. Fortunately, the Steam Machine remained a real thing, not vaporware like the aptly named Phantom console or a cruel dream like Half-Life 3 . We saw the Steam Controller get revised in real time, adding and dropping new features like touchscreens and thumb-sized mouse surfaces alongside traditional sticks and buttons.\n\nAs for the console itself, it turned out that Steam Machines would be a variety of systems from different manufacturers like Alienware and Origin and Maingear built according to Valve’s specifications. Again, the idea of bringing PC gaming norms like this into the console space was potentially revolutionary. Want to build a $10,000 super powerful Steam Machine? You can. Want to build a way more affordable Steam Machine? You can. Want to cram a Steam Machine into a tablet? Nothing could stop you.\n\nFinally, in late 2015, the first wave of Steam hardware hit the market. I even flew to Seattle to check out the gear in person. You can read my reviews of the Steam Machine console and the Steam Controller (as well as Will’s review of the Steam Link ) for more details, but the reality of Steam Machines unfortunately didn’t match the dream. And you can’t say that too often about Valve products.\nWhere to start. The controller is a cool idea but has a distractingly low build quality. The actual performance of the machine isn’t worth the price. With gaming consoles already arguably too similar to PCs, a gaming PC hooked up to your television isn’t actually that novel. A Steam Link streaming setup combined with Steam Big Picture mode on your existing computer is in fact a better, more convenient solution.\n\nFinally, the Steam Machine’s Achilles Heel is that it only supports games that run on Linux. Trying to encourage more support for the open-source operating system is certainly admirable. However, the rest of the PC game development community doesn’t have the same animosity for Microsoft that Gabe Newell does. So the Steam games that only run on Windows, the vast majority of Steam games, do not work with Steam Machines, a fatal blow for the new console initiative.\nStill, despite these initial challenges and reportedly low sales , Valve could have kept tinkering with the Steam Machine concept. It could refresh the hardware, it could’ve reached out to more manufacturers, and if sales picked up surely, it could have gotten more developers to create Linux versions of their games. But instead, in the year or so following the Steam Machine launch, Valve seems to have just abandoned the project.\nGranted, it’s easy to see why Valve was quick to move on. Its next hardware initiative was the Vive virtual reality headset made in partnership with HTC. Unlike Steam Machines, the Vive seemed poised to immediately stand out in its highly anticipated product category. Even before they launched, Steam Machines were beginning to look like an afterthought. The Vive is also arguably the best virtual reality headset on the market compared to rivals like Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR. Steam Machines weren’t a threat to rival consoles or gaming PCs.\n\nEven if the move made sense from both a financial and quality control standpoint, Valve’s swift abandonment of Steam Machines reflects what I think is a negative habit of the beloved company. Cutting your losses is all well and good but it’s possible to overdue it.\nMultiplayer games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2 (a sequel to a mod of a game Valve didn’t even make) making a ton of money isn’t an excuse to stop making fantastic single-player games in treasured franchises like Half-Life and Portal . Royalties from sales of other companies’ games also bringing in record profit shouldn’t be an excuse to stop making your own games all together. Even if it’s technically “worth it” eroding hard-earned fan goodwill is not worth it for a company with fans so devoted they call the CEO “Lord.”\nMaybe Valve’s brain trust will once again prove how much smarter it is compared to the rest of us and stealthily release new Steam Machines that turn the hardware into must-own gaming products. But if that doesn’t happen, always keep Steam Machines in mind as a rare but important example of Valve’s fallibility. So when Gaben announces plans for a superior, Valve-powered, alternative internet that sounds too good to be true, listen to the winds whisper, “Steam Machines.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:17:09.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
