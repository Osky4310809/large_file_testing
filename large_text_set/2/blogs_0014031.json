I thought \"what is happening here?\". \n“They told me there was a visa problem and a red flag had come up against my name because of an Iranian stamp in my passport. I went there to play in a legends match to open a stadium and didn't even stay overnight. Muslim leaders in rallying cry ahead of Trump travel ban protest \n“The two officials told me if I got on the flight I would simply be deported back to Qatar once I arrived in the States. I tried to explain I didn't even live in Qatar and was just trying to get to my home in the Caribbean.” \nIn January, US President Donald Trump sparked international outrage when he introduced an executive order suspending entry to anyone from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \nBut Yorke was barred under a previous law which requires anyone from the same seven countries to obtain a Visa before entering the US. \nYorke’s Iranian stamp dates back to 2015 when he played in a star-studded charity match in Tehran alongside Roberto Carlos and Luis Figo.
