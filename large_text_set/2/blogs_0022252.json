Citing Brexit and the election of U.S. President Donald Trump last year, Klopp has suggested he now expects the unexpected. The manager spoke ahead of Monday's trip to Leicester, and after the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union and Trump's surprise election win over Hillary Clinton, he is ready for anything: Bleacher Report UK @br_uk 2/24/2017, 1:21:33 PM Ranieri was sacked on Thursday just 10 months after guiding the Foxes to their fairytale Premier League title win last season with the club 17th after five straight defeats. Per the Liverpool Echo 's Ian Doyle , Klopp expressed sympathy for his Leicester counterpart: \"Do I have to understand it all the time? No. I’ve no idea why Leicester have done this. Everybody can see their situation in the league and Champions League. He’s a really special person. A really nice guy.\" The boss also expects a reaction from the Foxes after the sacking, according to James Pearce of the same outlet: James Pearce @JamesPearceEcho Klopp: \"Leicester's players will want to show a few things and it's our job not to let them. If we play our best we're difficult to face.\" Liverpool ended a run of five winless matches in their last outing as they beat rivals Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 at Anfield. Klopp is hoping for a repeat performance on Monday: James Pearce @JamesPearceEcho Klopp: \"We want to see a lot of the same things v Leicester as we saw v Tottenham. We want to be strong, lively and well organised.\" Per Liverpool's official Twitter feed, the 49-year-old singled out Georginio Wijnaldum as one of the Reds' top performers against Spurs: Liverpool FC @LFC 2/24/2017, 1:10:25 PM The Dutchman put in a great, all-action display against Tottenham and capped the performance with an assist. The German also heaped praise on Adam Lallana after he put pen to paper on a new deal to keep him at the club until 2020, per Doyle: \"We had to try everything to keep a player like him. Since I’ve been here, he has been a really important player for all the development steps we have taken. He is a good guy and at a perfect age to deliver consistency.\" Lallana has enjoyed his best season thus far at Liverpool and has seven goals and as many assists for the Reds. Looking ahead to the Leicester match, Klopp also gave the latest on Daniel Sturridge and Dejan Lovren's fitness following Liverpool's four-day training camp excursion to La Manga, Spain: James Pearce @JamesPearceEcho Klopp on La Manga: \"It was a proper camp. Daniel tried but we had to send him home due to virus.He will probably come in today for 1st time. 2/24/2017, 12:57:42 PM James Pearce @JamesPearceEcho Klopp on Lovren: \"Dejan felt really well when he was running outside today. He should be able to train with the team tomorrow.\" 2/24/2017, 1:12:11 PM The Foxes have been very poor in the Premier League of late, and they're still yet to score in the competition in 2017. Ranieri's departure could spark a reaction from the players, who've fallen well below the standard they're capable of for most of the campaign. If Liverpool can replicate their performance against Tottenham it's not likely to matter, but if the Reds aren't at their best and Leicester do come out fighting it could be an intriguing battle indeed.
