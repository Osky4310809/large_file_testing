By doing so, the union transformed itself into what the German sociologist Wolfgang Streeck has called “a powerful engine of liberalization in the service of a deep economistic restructuring of social life.” The single market, the Maastricht Treaty, the single currency and the Stability and Growth Pact combined to impose policies of deregulation, privatization, anti-labor rules, regressive tax regimes, cuts to welfare and financialization, and put them beyond the will of the people. Noting that the tools of Keynesian economics, upon which social democracy relies, are now illegal in Europe, even The Economist got queasy, writing that this arrangement “feels politically very dodgy.” As for the European Union-United States trade deal, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, it reads like Hayek’s midcentury fantasy come to life, potentially empowering corporations to sue elected governments for daring to listen to what their electors want. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Another key institution of the neoliberal union is the European Central Bank . Unelected and unaccountable , the bank’s governors are committed by treaty to favor deflation over growth, to prohibit state aid to stricken industries and to enforce austerity measures. Likewise, the single currency acts as an economic chokehold on entire regions of Europe, which can neither devalue their currency (as sovereign nations can) to become competitive nor grow their way out of stagnation because they are forced by austerity to shrink their economy. The human cost has been grotesque. The European Union’s economic waterboarding of Greece resulted in a quarter cut from hospital budgets and spending on drugs halved, while rates of H.I.V. infection spiked, cases of major depression doubled, suicide attempts rose by one-third, and the number of stillborn babies rose by 21 percent. Four in 10 Greek children were pushed into poverty, and one survey estimated that 54 percent of Greeks have become undernourished. Philippe Legrain, a former adviser to Manuel Barroso, then the president of the European Commission, observed that as “Europe’s creditor in chief” Germany “has trampled over values like democracy and national sovereignty and left a vassal state in its wake.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In extremis, elected national governments are effectively forced out and replaced by compliant technocrats, as George Papandreou of Greece and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy discovered. Sitting atop it all is the European Court of Justice, which issued rulings that the workers’ right to strike was subordinate to employers’ right do business freely. Hayek must be smiling. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Though the Leave slogan was mocked, Brexit really was about “taking back control.” Democracy needs a demos, a people for whom government is of, by and for. Without one, all you have is inter-elite management, treaty law and money grubbing. But how will “the people” be constructed? Politics will decide. A left populism will not seek to define the people as the far right does, in opposition to the immigrant other, but in opposition to those powerful neoliberal elites that are no longer able, as Professor Streeck says , “to build a social framework around the hot core of capitalist profit making.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It has been a colossal error by Davos Man left-wingers to think of nation-states as embarrassing anachronisms hostile to democracy. Far from being a threat to democracy, the nation-state is the only stable underpinning we have yet devised to sustain the commitments, sacrifices and levels of social trust that a democracy and a welfare state require. Right now, the left in Europe is playing by someone else’s rule book in a rigged game. One part of each nation, the winners, have been “using the globalized world as their extended playing field,” as Professor Streeck put it . One, if not the only, meaning of Brexit is that, having lost faith in glib promises of a globalization for all, the other part of the nation — the losers, the shutout and the disdained — have decided, in desperation, to make a sovereign gesture: to change the rules by returning to nation-state politics in order to have a go at leveling things up. They are “seeking refuge,” in Professor Streeck’s words, in “democratic protection, popular rule, local autonomy, collective goods and egalitarian traditions.” Rather than leave the field to the nativist right, some of us on the democratic left are going with them. \nAlan Johnson is a senior research fellow at the Britain Israel Communications and Research Center and the editor of its online journal, Fathom . \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:21:45.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
