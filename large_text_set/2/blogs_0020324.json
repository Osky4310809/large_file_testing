The two friends are the creative force behind Eagles of Death Metal, with Hughes on vocals and guitar, Homme as producer and sometime drummer. (Homme wasn't in Paris.) \nHughes has been writing songs since the attack, and much of his new material is in the same vein of riotous celebration as before, but the experience of Paris has played a part in shaping it. In his living room, Hughes brings up a demo recording on his iPhone, and a midtempo song blares from his home speakers, with springy guitar accents and a dark, urgent vocal: \"Lick your wounds and keep them clean/Holes are burning through, no voice left to scream.\" \nAs the song ends, he tears up. \"I can't even listen to them without getting like this,\" he says, voice cracking. \"It's a strange thing to negotiate. As one might imagine, simply doing the right thing is going to matter when it comes to this stuff.\" \nHughes calls up an instrumental track, this one built around a driving, Middle Eastern–influenced guitar pattern. He imagines including a phrase sung in Arabic. \"The lyrics I have in my head are very biblical, about being in the garden in the cool of the night, and being betrayed by your brother,\" he says, then pauses. \"I don't like writing shit like that. Even when I was going through my divorce, I made it into a hah-hah! kind of shit. And I've got to find that hah-hah! here.\" \nThese songs may not appear on the next Eagles of Death Metal album, or ever be released. Hughes may instead include them on an album from his flamboyant solo persona, Boots Electric. Or he could give them to another singer to tackle while he tries to reclaim the life he had before. \n\"Even with everything that's happened up to this point, I still feel like the luckiest motherfucker in the world,\" Hughes says. \"I just carry a little more depth with it.\" EXPAND Courtesy HBO \nThe concert began like any other EODM show, with Hughes testifying like a Southern preacher, his South Carolina accent cranked up to 11. Onstage at Le Bataclan, he shook his tail feathers and shouted, \"Tonight, if you are willing, you can be possessed by the spirit of rock & roll! Are you with me?\" \nHughes wore suspenders over a black EODM T-shirt illustrated with the silhouette of a young woman bent over, her hair blowing across a dreamy SoCal sunset. He wandered over to Dave Catching, white-bearded and slashing at a Flying V guitar, and then over to his girlfriend, Tuesday Cross, at the keyboard. \"Tonight I'm going to shake my dick, have a good time, and we're going to burn this motherfucker down!\" he yelled. \nOnline, there is much video evidence of a concert going well that night in Paris. A crowd surfer is carried overhead during the tragicomic \"Silverlake (K.S.O.F.M.).\" Another video wanders the entire theater, capturing a crowd lost in the excitement. \n\"It was one of our best shows. It was so crowded. Everybody was dancing,\" Catching recalls of the first 20 minutes. \"No one would have thought in a million years what would happen.\" \nA cellphone aimed at the stage captures the moment the terror began. Catching and Hughes are midway into the fuzzy guitar frenzy of \"Kiss the Devil\" when a loud, cracking noise stops them. Hughes sees muzzle flashes and runs offstage. Julian Dorio ducks behind his drums, and bassist Matt McJunkins quickly slips away. But Catching is caught standing center stage, guitar in his hand. He looks out into the darkness, utterly vulnerable. \nAt first, Catching assumed the flashes he saw were firecrackers. \"I could see people moving: 'That is so lame. Why is anyone throwing firecrackers in the middle of the crowd?' Then I saw the guys with the guns.\" Related Stories Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme Is Our Last Real Rock Star \nThe house lights went up. Hughes, trapped on the side of the stage with no exit, saw people die. There was a bloody mist in the air, and the taste of copper pennies in his mouth. \"Like a Hollywood effect, everyone fell like wheat in the wind,\" he says of the crowd, \"like a bomb with a concussion had gone off and knocked all the grass down.\" \nHours later, after locking himself in a bathroom and hearing shots and explosions just outside its door, Catching was the last survivor to be led out of the building by police. He had to walk across a dance floor covered in blood and the bodies of fans who didn't survive. \nWhile the musicians suffered no physical scars, the effects are felt every time they are onstage. On the road three months later to finish the European tour, Catching found it harder to concentrate on the music. He kept looking around the room for another attack: \"Once it's happened to you, you realize it is possible.\" It's better these days, he says, but people he now meets ask the same ham-fisted question over and over: \"Oh, that thing in Paris. How was that?\" Hughes, left, and EODM guitarist Dave Catching, who was the last survivor to leave the Bataclan. Steve Appleford \nIt took Homme three weeks to watch the new HBO documentary about his band and the Bataclan experience, taking it in a little at a time, shutting it off when it became too much. Released this month and directed by Homme's friend Colin Hanks, Eagles of Death Metal: Nos Amis (Our Friends) takes a deep look at the band and the personality of Hughes, with his friendship with Homme at the center, while leading up to the attack and its aftermath. With the doc completed, Homme says he plans to never speak of the attack again with anyone other than survivors and those closest to him. Both he and Hughes hope to move forward. \nSitting in an empty Hollywood recording studio, Homme recounts the experience for what he insists will be the last time. Wearing a black motorcycle jacket, a small cross over his chest, he stands up to close the door, then describes getting the first text alerting him to the tragedy unfolding in real time on the other side of the globe. He talks of suffering from a distance, as friends he's known most of his life were in mortal danger. He made calls and sent texts through the day and night, checking in with everyone's families and significant others. He called Hughes' teenage son. \"I found myself saying a lot of stuff I wasn't even sure I believed: 'I'm going to get them home.'\" \nHomme might have been with them in Paris that night but chose to stay close to home, where his wife, rocker Brody Dalle, was pregnant with their third child. On short notice, Dorio was recruited to sit in for the European tour. All the band's musicians and crew escaped the massacre, except for one: British-born merch manager Nick Alexander, 36, an upbeat rock & roll lifer who was in the lobby and among the first killed. The Bataclan attack was one of several across Paris that night that killed a total of 130 people. \nHomme has contemplated the meaning of the massacre and its implications for how he and the others have chosen to spend their lives. In the past, he has had moments of doubt over the importance of his work as an artist. \"I sometimes struggle with: 'Oh my gosh, what I do is so silly.' It feels thoroughly unimportant at these existential moments,\" he says. \"But all of a sudden, it was no, no, no. Never again will I think that. The arts and expression are so important, not just for my own self but to try to bring people into a way of thinking.\" \nFew filmmakers could have persuaded Homme to participate in a documentary on the attack — maybe only actor-director Hanks. They first met nearly a decade ago and bonded over music, especially brilliant obscurities such as Blowfly and 1950s go-go music from Las Vegas. Homme also admired the dedication Hanks showed in making the 2015 music documentary All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records.
