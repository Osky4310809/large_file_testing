Dozens of flights for Thursday have been cancelled to and from Heathrow airport. The airport said: “Strong winds and poor weather forecast for February 23, related to Storm Doris, are expected to cause some flight delays and cancellations across the UK. “If you are due to travel, please check your flight status with your airline prior to arriving at the airport.” High winds are expected to reduce the usual arrivals rate at the UK’s busiest airport. With little resilience in the system, short-haul flights are being cancelled to provide “firebreaks”. Following a conference call involving the Met Office, air-traffic controllers and the airlines that serve Heathrow with multiple frequencies, British Airways has cancelled more than 40 flights to and from the airport. Domestic flights to Manchester, Leeds/Bradford, Newcastle, Glasgow and Belfast have been cancelled, with passengers rebooked on other flights. Two cancellations have been made to both Aberdeen and Amsterdam, together with the return legs. Lufthansa has cancelled a rotation from Frankfurt to Heathrow, and Aer Lingus, Air France and KLM are also expected to cancel flights. Rail travellers within the UK were warned of disruption caused by speed restrictions imposed because of worries about debris being blown onto tracks. On the East Coast main line from London King's Cross to Yorkshire, Newcastle and Scotland, Network Rail has imposed a speed restriction north of Hitchin between 11am and 6pm. Passengers have been told : “This will cause short notice alterations and cancellations with a particularly high risk of significant disruption on the Fen Line between Cambridge and Kings Lynn. “Passengers are advised to check before they travel and to allow longer for their journeys.” Virgin Trains East Coast has advised passengers booked to travel on their services on Thursday to travel either tonight or before midday on Friday. Normal Advance ticket restrictions will not apply. On Southern, the rail service between London Victoria and Brighton will be halved to one train an hour between 11am and 6pm, while Thameslink is cancelling trains between London Bridge and Brighton. Arriva Trains Wales has suspended trains between Wolverhampton and Birmingham International.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:56:51.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
