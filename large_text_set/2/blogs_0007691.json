UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 12 hours ago 0 \nDuring the \"In Memoriam\" segment of this year's Grammy Awards, the organizers gave no mention to Nick Menza, late Megadeth drummer who was nominated for seven Grammys over the years. \nThis is not the first time late metal musicians were snubbed by the Grammys. Some of the previous notable omissions from this segment include Slayer's Jeff Hanneman, Wayne Static of Static-X, Dave \"Oderus Urungus\" Brockie of GWAR, and classic Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr. \nSome of the artists that did get recognized include Leonard Cohen, Keith Emerson, Greg Lake, Prince, George Michael, John Wetton, Merle Haggard, Scotty Moore, Butch Trucks, and more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:59:52.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
