Fellow conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi who was just hired to run the new Infowars’ D.C. bureau, will apply for White House Correspondence credentials, he announced on Twitter Tuesday . \nJones, one of Trump’s more boisterous supporters, claimed in a video last week that he was already offered credentials. \n“Here’s the deal, I know I get White House credentials. We’ve already been offered them. We’re going to get them, but I’ve just got to spend the money to send somebody there,” Jones said in the video . “I want to make sure it’s even worth it. I don’t want to just sit there up there like: ‘I’m in the media, look our people are there.’” \nA day after the video was published online, the White House press office denied offering credentials to Jones. \n“He is not credentialed for the White House. The White House Press Office has not offered him credentials,” White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders told BuzzFeed News last week. \nBut on Tuesday, Corsi said on Twitter that he will be joining Infowars and seemed rather confident that he will be credentialed for White House press briefings. With ALEX JONES I will head INFOWARS DC News Bureau & apply to be White House Correspondent for INFOWARS – I’m excited about the opportunity \n— Jerome Corsi (@jerome_corsi) January 31, 2017 \nCorsi’s previous employer was the conservative website WorldNetDaily, which has been accused by the Southern Poverty Law Center of “peddling white nationalism.” \nSome of the conspiracy theories that Jones has legitimized over the years include the fake moon landing, the U.S. government’s involvement in the Twin Tower attacks, and the use of actors in the Sandy Hook shootings.
