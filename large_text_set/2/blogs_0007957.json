There was something about the casually irreverent club toss that made me pause the TV that afternoon in Venice Beach. There’s a little bit of that club toss in all of us. So I grabbed a pencil and paper and sketched out (roughly) what would become the William Murray Golf icon . Advertisement Advertisement 6 \nSix years later, we return to Pebble Beach as sponsors of the event. Bill is rocking WMG all over the course. Ever golf in a button down? Now you can. Bill named the tartan shirt ‘ The Irreverent ’ and you must sign up to have shot at any William Murray Gear. It has become the most sought-after performance clothing in the world. \nOr if you’re lucky enough to be in Pebble we announced today that Pebble Beach Pro shop would be the exclusive retail carrier of William Murray Golf gear this year. 7 \nDreams to come true. I’m well aware that I’m living the absolute dream of dreams right now and I’m grateful to the Chive community for all your support. I’m on my way to join Bill and the Murray family this weekend in Pebble Beach. You’ll want to follow my Instagram for what’s about to happen. There’s about to be a lot of unexpected moments. \n( nd William Murray Golf’s Instagram as well in case I get too drunk to Instagram the moment. I’m already half in the bag.) 8", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:14:11.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
