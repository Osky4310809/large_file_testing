And to be honest, this past year has gone by so quickly that I still can’t believe it myself sometimes. \n\"One day during training with United last season, my team-mates told me that I’d been selected for the national team to go to Euro 2016. I literally didn’t believe it. I thought they were joking. \n\"I’d only just made my debut for Manchester United a few months before. Phil Jones came up to me as we were heading into the changing rooms and said, 'I'm tellin' ya mate, you’re going to France'. \n\"As I made my way into the building, some of the staff were telling me the same thing. When I got my mobile phone out of my locker, there were messages from my friends, my brothers, my mum, all saying the same thing: England \n\"At that point, I was buzzing, but still kind of confused. And then my manager at the time, Louis van Gaal, walked up to me. ‘Quick word?' I didn’t know what to think. \nOzil out of England game \n\"I mean, I had expected to play with the under-21s, but what he told me was massive. ‘The national team phoned,’ he said. ‘Go and enjoy yourself.’ That was it. I was going to France.\" \nRashford made two appearances for the Three Lions in France before they were knocked out by Iceland at the last-16 stage, while he has featured in 38 games in all competitions for United this season, scoring seven goals.
