Watters asked Trump about this and about the media figures who wonder whether Trump leaked the returns on purpose in order to distract from the intrigue surrounding the years of tax reports he refuses to disclose. \nTrump immediately went on the attack, saying, “They are bad people. There is something wrong with them….It’s illegal to do what they did.” Trump eventually turned to his argument that Washington insiders are trying to leak information about him in order to hurt his presidency. \n“It’s terrible what’s going on in Washington.
