Well, Ludovic Lazareth and his crew are back with another of their amazing custom builds, this time based on a Yamaha R1 and dubbed “Caferacer Lazareth – Back to the future”. \nTaking a 1999 Yamaha R1 with some history behind it – it was customised by Lazareth, filmed, and crashed, on the set of the Vin Diesel movie “Babylon A.D.”– he decided to have some fun with the R1, building it his way. Since the original front telescopic forks were missing, gone to another project, Lazareth designed and fabricated a single-sided swingarm front end for the Caferacer, much like the Lazareth LM847 . \nSwingarm front-ends are not new of course, with several manufacturers putting forward designs for the mass market over the decades. Ultimately, the cost, complexity and weight of swingarm front suspensions meant a lack of market acceptance, save for specials and custom builds. \nFor Back to the future, Lazareth, with no customer constraints on the build spec, clad the entire machine in carbon-fibre. The carbon-fibre fuel tank encloses an actual aluminium unit underneath for safety reasons, while the original R1 frame is retained, with modifications for the front swingarm mount. \nA pair of wheels from a Triumph 955 in 17-inch diameter are used front and rear, and the swingarms are mated to absorbers sourced from TFX Suspension. Chopped up a little at the rear-end, a new floating link system gives the rear suspension the necessary movement. \nThe exhaust is a single pipe, surrounded by LEDs that function as brake and rear lights. Everything else on Back to the future that could be moulded out of carbon-fibre is, and Brembo supplies its usual high-quality braking system. \nIn the cockpit, a set of arrow-straight drag bars provide something for the rider to hang on to, and an Acewell digital speedometer supplies all the necessary information. Further kit on this Lazareth custom is taken from the Rizoma catalogue. \nBy all accounts, Back to the future handles “like any other street bike”, but we do wonder how the front turns in with that 180-section tyre. If you are interested, Lazareth will build you a machine just like Back to the Future, at a price starting from 50,000 euro (RM234,961).
