To drum up some interest, the network has released a new promo features an homage to the classic Man of Steel line: \"Look up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!\" \nIt begins with Emily Locke (Vanessa Hudgens) looking up at the Charm City skyscrapers, where Crimson Fox is being chased and attacked by a flame-throwing evildoer. \"What's that up in the sky?\" she asks as the action gets closer to where she and her coworkers are having lunch on a balcony. \"Is it a bird? Is it a plane?\" \nWhen the super-combatants fight impacts a nearby building, Emily becomes covered in a debris of dust and her cup of coffee goes flying everywhere. Danny Pudi's character looks at her and deadpans: \"You seriously can't tell the difference between a bird and a plane?\" \nEmily Locke lands her dream job as Director of Research and Development for Wayne Security in Charm City, home to super heroes and villains and citizens fed up with the collateral damage of their constant fighting. Full of confidence and big ideas, Emily quickly learns that her aspirations far exceed those of her new boss and officemates, so it will be up to her to lead the team toward their full potential and the realization that you donâ€™t need superpowers to be a hero. \nThe cast features Vanessa Hudgens, Alan Tudyk, Danny Pudi, Christina Kirk, and Ron Funches. \nJustin Halpern, Patrick Schumacker, Len Goldstein, Marc Buckland and Dean Lorey are executive producers of Powerless . Buckland served as the director of the pilot. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television and is based on the characters from DC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:06:36.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
