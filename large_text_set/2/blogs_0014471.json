Harward will be on ABC’s This Week tomorrow to speak out for the first time since that decision, but so far there’s been reporting he turned down the position because 1) the White House didn’t meet his conditions, and 2) he watched Trump’s press conference this week.\nAnd a report in The Wall Street Journal yesterday says that Petraeus is out of the running because he too had conditions the White House wouldn’t meet:\nFormer CIA director David Petraeus said anyone considering the national security adviser job in the Trump administration should have control over personnel and the White House would commit to a disciplined process of crafting security policy… An official briefed on the search for a NSC adviser said Mr. Petraeus was no longer being considered because the White House thought his demands were unreasonable.\n[ image via screengrab ]\n— —\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac\n ", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fdavid-petraeus-is-out-of-the-running-to-be-national-security-advisor%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/petraeus.jpg&description=David%20Petraeus%20Is%20Out%20of%20the%20Running%20to%20Be%20National%20Security%20Advisor", "https://twitter.com/KristinFisher/status/833060230099517442", "https://twitter.com/PressSec", "https://twitter.com/DavidWright_CNN/status/833060503131930624", "https://twitter.com/#!/feldmaniac", "https://twitter.com/POTUS", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fdavid-petraeus-is-out-of-the-running-to-be-national-security-advisor%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/petraeus-says-national-security-adviser-should-hire-own-staff-1487352822"], "published": "2017-02-19T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:48:55.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
