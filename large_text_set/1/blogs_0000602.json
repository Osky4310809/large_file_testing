Or something. Enlarge Image Photo by Asus \nYou know that moment where the giant evil robot dragon opens up its gigantic jagged metal mouth -- only to reveal a death ray powerful enough to subjugate the planet? \nWell, Asus has captured that moment at CES 2017 in the form of a new gaming PC. It's called the Asus ROG GT51CH, because Asus is bad at names . Point is, you can soon own a desktop computer that bears a striking resemblance to an Evangelion . Or Bahamut . Or a Reaper . Enlarge Image \nSeparated at birth? \nInside the 50-pound (that's not a typo. It weighs 22 kilograms) frame, you'll find Intel's new Core i7-7700K processor, a GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card, 8GB of DDR4 memory, a 256GB solid state drive, a DVD burner and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. You can get plenty more power if you pay -- the system tops out at twin GTX 1080 graphics cards paired together in SLI, 64GB of memory, a 3TB hard drive and a pair of 512GB PCIe solid state drives paired in RAID 0 for even more speed. \nInside, it's a fairly standard giant PC case, with loads of space for full-size hard drives. And a slant, because slants are the in-thing. Photo by Asus \nThere's also fully customizable lighting on the motherboard and around the system's central air intake up front -- which means yes, the robot dragon can emit a blue death ray if that's how you'd prefer to be obliterated. \nThe Asus ROG GT51CH should be available this summer. Asus won't say how much you'll pay just yet. Share your voice", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T05:48:14.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
