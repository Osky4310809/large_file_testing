He loves the club, and the club loves him (Photo: Reuters) Pablo's a big Manchester fan (Photo: Clive Mason) \nSpeaking in the new issue of Four Four Two magazine, Zabaleta said: “This place has definitely changed me. \n\"When I go on holiday to Spain for a month in the summer with the family, or somewhere with more sunshine, I find that I miss all the rain in Manchester. It sounds crazy, but it’s true.\" \nNo Pablo, it is crazy. \nBut City fans will love you for it. poll loading Who is the better right-back? 500+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T15:00:10.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
