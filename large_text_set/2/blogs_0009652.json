Maximilian Arnoldâ€™s equalizing goal in the 50th minute set the stage for their comeback, and it also marked the 600th home goal scored in the clubâ€™s history. This one is so good it should count for two. ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± #WOBTSG #Bundesliga https://t.co/UyIQuXeqC5 \nâ€” FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 12, 2017 \nThereâ€™s absolutely nothing the keeper can do about that. Arnold times the bounce, catches it cleanly, and launches a perfect volley into the lower corner to bring Wolfsburg level and bring his team level on the day. \nArnold strikes it so well, itâ€™s still rising as it crashes in to the back of the net. Itâ€™s the type of volley that probably still would have gone in if he struck it from 10 yards further away. You really just donâ€™t stop strikes like that. \nTechnique, power, three points, and a little bit of history to go along with it? Not a bad day at the office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T20:05:37.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
