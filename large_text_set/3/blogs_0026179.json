Smith Were Yelling At Each Other The Entire Time Clem | Email \nYes I realized that headline is basically the opposite of clickbait, but I wanted to blog this video anyway. This ridiculous screengrab is my way of thanking you for clicking on this blog. \nI think I have watched 5 minutes of First Take on TV my entire life. Skip and Stephen A playing up their schtick wasn’t my cup of tea. And I understand that this is basically the same nonsense as Skip vs. Stephen A. But somehow I enjoyed this LaVar Ball video wa more than I should have. Is LaVar Ball a madman that spews a bunch of nonsense in the name of promotion? Of course! But that’s Stephen A’s game. You know, the guy that said that there is no way Johnnie Cochran would have beat him in the OJ trial or the guy that threatened Kevin Durant for the simple reason that he said he wasn’t interested in playing for the Lakers. \nSo am I going to enjoy a guy like that getting screamed at by the most outrageous guy in sports today? OF COURSE. Fuck that guy. Stephen A. has outscreamed and outcrazied his guests and cohosts hundreds of times. So it was great to see LaVar act like a damn maniac by screaming and making ridiculous faces the entire time. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Especially if he’s crazy and loud. Crazy and loud guys are annoying when they are yelling at you, but they are great when they are screaming at people you hate. At least LaVar comes off as a kinda likable crazy guy. \nAnd now that the Knicks are embracing the triangle (and unofficially embracing the tank), I am coming to the realization that LaVar Ball and myself may become allies if by some miracle Lonzo ends up on the Knicks. And if that’s the case, I have to blindly support everything that he says. Sure he will turn on Knicks fans sooner or later. But not before he rips James Dolan, Steve Mills, and every shitty Knicks executive and player we have had over the last decade-plus. And that will be a TON of fun. I think I’m officially on Team LaVar with KFC (until the Knicks win a few meaningless games and play themselves right out of a Top 2 pick). \nOh yeah and these shirts are absolute FIRE. Wouldn’t mind seeing them in Knicks colors sometime in June. The redemption of the Ball Don’t Lie shirt may be the best story in Barstool history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:48:58.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
