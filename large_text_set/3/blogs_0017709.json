Longtime party member Byron Nelson was a distant third, with 40 votes.\n“Today, it’s springtime in Alberta,” Kenney proclaimed after the results were revealed.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh Jason Kenney celebrates his leadership win at the Alberta PC Party leadership convention in Calgary, Alta., Saturday, March 18, 2017. “This result sends a message to our fellow Albertans who are struggling, to those 200,000 Albertans who are looking for work, we are going to ensure there is a government on your side.”\nKenney will now begin the next phase of his unite-the-right campaign by seeking a deal with the Wildrose party to join forces under a new conservative banner.\nUnder Alberta rules, political parties cannot merge. Rather, they must fold up shop and surrender their assets before seeking to create a new party.\nWildrose party Leader Brian Jean has said he’s open to meeting with the new PC leader, but has stressed that any new conservative party will be created under a Wildrose legal framework, with the approval of Wildrose members.\nGavin Young/Postmedia Network Jean congratulated Kenney in a statement Saturday evening.\n“Wildrose has its dancing shoes on when it comes to creating a single, principled, consolidated, conservative movement,” he said. “I hope to meet with Jason on Monday and share with him more about the direction I have heard from our members.”\nKenney has stressed unity is necessary to avoid the vote splitting he says led to the majority win by Premier Rachel Notley’s NDP in 2015. Notley’s win brought to an end four decades of PC rule in the province.\nKenney attacked the New Democrats in his speech after his win.\n“Today is the beginning of the end of this disastrous socialist government,” he said as supporters roared their approval. “You have decided, we have decided, to ensure the defeat of this tax-hiking, job-killing, debt-loving, mean-spirited, incompetent NDP government.\n“We Albertans are going to unite to take our province back.”\nStarke and Nelson ran on promises to follow the wishes of party members who voted just a year ago to not merge with the Wildrose, but instead rebuild the PCs.\nRelated Graham Thomson: Spoiler alert! Jason Kenney will win the Alberta PC leadership race. But what happens next? Colby Cosh: An Alberta politician revolts against a conflict-of-interest rap. Here’s why you may care Old Tories, Brian Jean and obviously the NDP: A quick guide to everyone who hates Jason Kenney Kenney’s critics fear he will abandon the party’s centrist approach on social issues to embrace the social conservatism of the Wildrose.\nDelegates booed Starke during his speech earlier Saturday when he warned that a merger with the Wildrose could tar the PCs with the label of intolerance toward women and minorities.\nThe NDP immediately reached out to progressive voters on Twitter after Kenney’s win.\n“Progressives looking for a modern and moderate party? Welcome,” the party said. “Join us.”\nFor Kenney, unity is a road map with no road. There is no provision in the PC constitution to dissolve itself and the leader is just one vote on the party’s board of directors.\nThe PCs and Wildrose, should they join forces, would have just two years to create constituency associations and field candidates in time for the next election, set for the spring of 2019.\nKenney has said Canada’s conservative parties united federally in far less time, bringing about the Conservative governments of former prime minister Stephen Harper.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T03:37:42.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
