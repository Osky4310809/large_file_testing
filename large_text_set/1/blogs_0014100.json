Films, data, experts, writing, graphics, the lot. \nWe’ll be hearing from people who can actually see climate change happening before their very eyes, flooding into their lives through their front door, or drying up the land they rely on for sustenance. \nWe are speaking to the visionaries who have solutions and tell us “don’t give up – it’s not game over just yet”. And we’ll be asking what comes next, whether Donald Trump can or indeed will pick apart the 25-year movement to get governments working together to head off environmental disaster. \nIt’ll be a bit rough and ready, I reckon, a cross between a telethon and a disaster movie. I really hope you’ll join us and let us know what you think. \nMark Rice-Oxley", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T09:56:56.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
