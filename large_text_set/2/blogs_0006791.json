After Dodge told us that any resemblance between the wide-bodied Challengers seen in trailers for The Fate of the Furious and the upcoming 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon is purely coincidental, the result of “ creative license ” by the studio, a YouTube video surfaced featuring Vin Diesel and a pair of wide-body Challengers with Demon graphics emblazoned on their fenders. \n-And then there’s Dodge’s latest teaser for the high-performance muscle car. Details released by Dodge include the above image of the Demon’s massive 45-square-inch Air Grabber hood scoop—a hood scoop that looks conspicuously like the one featured on the Challengers in The Fate of the Furious (below).\n- \n-Along with a smattering of teaser images, Dodge also released a handful of details about the Demon’s air-intake system. For instance, the Demon’s giant Air Grabber hood scoop is sealed and ducted to an intake box that Dodge claims is bigger than the unit found in the Challenger SRT Hellcat . For good measure, Dodge also pastes an Air Grabber logo on the underside of the Demon’s aluminum hood, lest an owner forget the duct’s proper name.\n-Additionally, the Demon sprouts a hole in its passenger-side inner headlight to feed even more air to the big V-8 (the Hellcat has this feature on only the driver’s-side inner headlight). While Dodge is refusing to share exactly how much air the system is able to suck in, out of fear we might be able to calculate the car’s horsepower, the brand notes that the Demon’s air-inlet temperature falls by more than 30 degrees in comparison with the Hellcat.\n- - - Here’s How Much Horsepower We Think the Dodge Challenger Demon Will Make - Second Dodge SRT Demon Teaser Released!
