Congratulations everyone. I request to be left alone. I said what I had to say.. (1/2)\n— Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017\nTrolled for changing her profile picture, the Lady Shri Ram College student felt threatened enough to lodge a complaint with the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) on Monday. This 20-year-old had to be provided police protection — all because she expressed her dissent against a student’s body affiliated to the political party that is in government.\nWhy are you afraid? Come out for our march on Tuesday in north campus. #FightbackDU pic.twitter.com/sriy1lgiS3\n— Kawalpreet Kaur (@kawalpreetdu) February 24, 2017\nUnion home minister Kiren Rijiju chose to respond to Ms Kaur’s pictures, including one in May, when she had posted a video message urging peace between India and Pakistan; one of placards in the video said, “Pakistan did not kill my dad, war killed him.”\nWho’s polluting this young girl’s mind? A strong Arm Force prevents a war. India never attacked anyone but a weak India was always invaded. https://t.co/gXHkAGi9sh\n— Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) February 27, 2017\nToday the criticism was sharper: “She is a martyr’s daughter. His soul must be weeping that his daughter is being misguided by those who celebrate on the bodies of martyrs,” Rijiju said.\nOn Twitter, the minister defended why he chose to react.\nEveryone has right of views but she said Pakistan didn’t kill our brave martyr & India should shun war. India never perpetrated violence! https://t.co/2b8SHLdPRg\n— Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) February 27, 2017\nLater the minister clarified: “When I said somebody is polluting her (Gurmehar’s) mind, I meant Leftists. She has the freedom to speak her mind. She has all the right to do whatever she wants. So don’t disturb her. Obviously, I stand by what I tweeted (in reaction to Gurmehar’s views). I speak my mind”\nAnother BJP MP Pratap Simha had likened Ms Kaur to Dawood Ibrahim.\npic.twitter.com/NaG4xVrT2B\n— Pratap Simha (@mepratap) February 26, 2017\nIn my opinion, ministers, no matter what their political affiliation, shouldn’t resort to commenting on profile picture changes and student campaigns. It would have been refreshing instead to see the home minister outline steps taken for Ms Kaur’s safety and a harder line on trolls who threatened her with rape.\n“I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it,” these words from Evelyn Beatrice Hall are the very embodiment of a democracy.\nAttack on Sovereignty?\nAny state or nation exists on the inherent patriotism of its people. Questioning the government or its ministers doesn’t tantamount to questioning the sovereignty of a nation.\nIf my speech is seditious, book me under the law but don’t beat me up for it.\nWhat seems bizarre is this war on social media — where as a retaliation to Gurmehar’s decision to change her profile picture, a video done in April-May 2016 was dragged out.\nIn the 4 minute 23 second video promoting an end to wars and peace between India and Pakistan, there were over 30 placards used. Placard 13 that said — Pakistan did not kill my dad, war killed him — was selectively chosen, played up and trolled.\nMore than anything else, what I’m unable to understand is how Yogeshwar Dutt and Virender Sehwag find themselves in as a part of the trolling community.\n🙈🙈🙈 pic.twitter.com/SiH90ouWee\n— Yogeshwar Dutt (@DuttYogi) February 28, 2017\nBat me hai Dum ! #BharatJaisiJagahNahi pic.twitter.com/BNaO1LBHLH\n— Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) February 26, 2017\nFreedom of Speech\nHow much is one willing to pay for the Freedom of Speech? It is a question that all of us must ask of ourselves today and to each his own. There are no rights or wrongs on this one.\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley suggested last week that there should be curbs on free speech. He said: “I personally believe that free speech in India should be debated; whether free speech permits you to assault the sovereignty of a nation.”\nStudent protests, regardless of ideology, aren’t a threat to India’s integrity. As long as they are peaceful, they aren’t even a threat to law and order. Ensuring that is the business of the police & prashashan. And in Ramjas they failed to do so. I, for one, refuse to believe that placards can threaten my country’s sovereignty and national integrity. India isn’t that fickle — it can accommodate multitude of opinion.\nCurbs on free speech question the intent of a citizen. If you must, curb the unfettered freedom trolls have on social media, curb the language of hate.\nCaution against Propaganda and Click-Baits:\nTo all my colleagues in the media, a word of caution.\nDon’t play into the hands of propagandists on either side of the divide – it tars what we do as journalists.\nWhile everyone has been describing Gurmehar as a Kargil Martyr’s daughter, the truth is that her father Mandeep Singh was killed in a terror attack on an Army camp in Jammu and Kashmir in 1999. Captain Mandeep Singh was serving in 4RR (Rashtriya Rifles) and died defending his company headquarters.\nThis in no way takes away from his martyrdom or bravery but facts are facts. When we say ‘Kargil Martyr’s Daughter’ (and it was based on a video done by Gurmehar in April-May 2016) in a headline, it tugs at that common sentiment and appeal to emotion rather than reason.\nTo build perception in ways that are indiscernible is to play into the hands of the propagandists.\nAs one of my colleagues pointed out, each time we write Gurmehar Kaur was threatened on social media, the perception that’s built is the ABVP was behind these threats. That may or may not be true as there is no way of verifying whether all these trolls are members of ABVP or not. They could, in theory, be opposition activists trying to tarnish the ABVP’s image. As far-fetched as this sounds, political outfits cannot be held squarely responsible for the acts of those sympathetic to their cause.\nGurmehar never asked for the ‘Kargil Martyr’s Daughter ‘epithet to be added — most did it on their own volition to make the headline more ‘click-baity’. That is a disservice to journalism and, more importantly, to India.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kawalpreetdu/status/835139697089224706", "https://t.co/SiH90ouWee", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/edkYYQLMC8M", "https://t.co/BNaO1LBHLH", "https://twitter.com/mehartweets/status/836393448936648704", "https://twitter.com/mehartweets/status/836393010044686336", "https://t.co/gXHkAGi9sh", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FightbackDU?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/virendersehwag/status/835856883655245824", "https://t.co/sriy1lgiS3", "https://twitter.com/DuttYogi/status/836408725657255936", "https://twitter.com/mehartweets/status/836393973446893569", "https://t.co/NaG4xVrT2B", "https://twitter.com/mepratap/status/835863776012312578", "https://twitter.com/KirenRijiju/status/836055440169525249", "https://t.co/2b8SHLdPRg", "https://twitter.com/KirenRijiju/status/836153096128495616", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BharatJaisiJagahNahi?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-28T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:02:03.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
