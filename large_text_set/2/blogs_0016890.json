Mike Lee of Utah, and newscasting legend John Stossel. There will also be a slate of special \"Reason Day\" sessions that deliver cutting-edge views on \"Free Minds and Free Markets.\"\nTo add to the excitement, FreedomFest impresario Mark Skousen has teamed up with Newsmax magazine to produce a list of \"the 50 Most Influential Libertarians\" in each of eight different categories such as business and finance, entertainment and the news, freedom-movement organizations, media, politics, and academia.\nAmong the Reasoners in the hunt are Ronald Bailey, Brian Doherty, and Virginia Postrel (authors); John Stossel, Matt Welch, and myself (media); and Katherine Mangu-Ward, David Nott, and Robert W. Poole (think tanks and educational institutions).\nYou can vote for up to five candidates in each category and the survey is open until March 15. \nGo here now to cast your ballot and get $100 off your FreedomFest registration fee . \nOver the past years, Reason TV has interviewed dozens of libertarians ranging from P.J. O'Rourke to Penn Jillette to John Mackey to Crossfit creator Greg Glassman to LP presidential ticket Gary Johnson and Bill Weld. Go here for a complete list .\nAnd click below to watch last year's raucous debate among Matt Welch, Jeffrey Tucker, Dan Magru, Wayne Allyn Root and me over whether libertarians should vote for Donald Trump. Called the most controversial and intense panel ever at FreedomFest, it's something to behold.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:47:48.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
