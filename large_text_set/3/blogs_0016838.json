We are very disappointed this happened,” Misbah said, adding that strict action must be taken against the spot-fixers. \nThe 42-year-old captain lamented that the fixing scandal has tarnished the image of Pakistan cricket. \n“It appears that the [positive] image for Pakistan cricket we had strived to build for the past seven years has been wasted,” Misbah said. \nAbout the upcoming tour to West Indies, the skipper said he anticipates the series to be tough, adding that the West Indies’ players know how to leverage their home conditions to their advantage. \nCricketers Sharjeel Khan, Khalid Latif, Mohammad Irfan and Shahzaib Hasan have been provisionally suspended from all forms of cricket for violating   Board's anti-corruption code. Sharjeel and Latif, who were suspended during the opening week of the PSL for suspected links with an international fixing syndicate, face a minimum five years’ ban. \nBatsman Shahzaib, who was charged and suspended on Friday, also faces a minimum five years' ban. Fast bowler Mohammad Irfan faces a minimum six months' ban. \nNasir Jamshed, who resides in the UK, was suspended during PSL after the PCB said it had 'concrete evidence' against the former opener. He was also arrested along with another suspect by Britain's National Crime Agency last month as part of investigations but later released on bail, according to reports. 0 0 Misbah calls for life ban on players involved in spot-fixing was   Geo News, Misbah, Misbah Ul Haq, Pakistan Cricket, Psl 2017, Psl Spot Fixing,   \"Misbah calls for life ban on players involved in spot-fixing\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/134816-Misbah-calls-for-life-ban-on-players-involved-in-spot-fixing+GeoSport- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T10:44:21.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
