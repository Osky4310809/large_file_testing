In a bizarre turn of affairs, Lisa Kudrow has revealed that Courteney Cox’s ancestors were responsible for the death of an English king, and WHAHH!?\nNow, we know that Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow are still BFFs. The pair, who of course worked together on seminal sitcom Friends , absolutely killed it during this trivia quiz , and, even though Kudrow has put a stopper in any Friends reunion rumors , we love the idea of all the gang still hanging out together, whether it be in Central Perk or in L.A..\nHowever, whether the pair will still be friends (gettit?) after Lisa Kudrow just revealed that Courteney Cox’s ancestors committed regicide remains to be seen! Speaking to Stephen Colbert on The Late Show , Kudrow told how Cox had taken part in her TV show Who Do You Think You Are? , in which celebrities trace their genealogy in a bid to discover more about themselves.\nExplaining how Cox had signed up for the show, and Kudrow revealed that her former co-star discovered something rather shocking during her episode.\n“[Courteney Cox] is the best person I know, and she was hoping that her family were good people, and no one murdered anyone,” Kudrow said. In a cruel twist of fate, however, it seems that Courteney Cox’s ancestors weren’t the squeaky clean people she was hoping for.\n“It turns out her ancestors murdered the King of England. That’s all.” Kudrow revealed. Given that The Late Show was about to go on commercial break, Kudrow couldn’t divulge anymore information about which King of England Cox’s family had murdered (!). We’re *seriously* intrigued. Perhaps Cox’s family were involved in the regicide of Charles I?\nLuckily we don’t have too long to wait until Courteney Cox’s episode of Who Do You Think You Are? airs on TLC, as it’s set to broadcast this Sunday. Guess until then we’ll have to go and brush up on our British history.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T15:35:41.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
