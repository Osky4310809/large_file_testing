Is Rohingya persecution caused by business interests rather than religion?

(countries) say that maybe Aung San Suu Kyi needs more time,” Lee said, referring to the Nobel peace laureate who leads Myanmar’s civilian government. \nSuu Kyi’s government, which took charge last year after decades of oppressive military rule, has rejected Lee’s bid to set up a Commission of Inquiry and insisted its own national probe can uncover the facts in Rakhine. \nLee conceded to reporters that a full international probe “could have a destabilising affect” in that it may implicate the military in crimes against humanity, but she insisted it was in the government’s interest to get the facts out. \nShe also told the council that the government’s internal probe had already been proved inadequate. \nRepresentatives from the EU, The Netherlands and Britain all avoided the question of a Commission of Inquiry during Monday’s discussion. \nBritain’s envoy to the council, Julian Braithwaite, said the international community needed to “engage (Myanmar) without damaging the delicate civilian/military balance”.
