Chris Spags | Email \nOne of the less sexy perks of the office is being in a room full of content-creating peers and being able to get a bunch of immediate opinions on one question: “Is this worth blogging?” It’s a simple question, one I often ask myself to figure out whether or not a piece of content is worthwhile to write about. And normally a one-second video of a chick grabbing a tit isn’t quite enough. \nBut not every model is Charlotte McKinney. Perfect face, amazing body, everything you could ever possibly want out of your vacuous busty blonde models who would never fuck you in a million years. I mean here are some photos of her just hanging out at the beach last week and they’re also unbelievably sexy: \nThere’s a little surprise in that last tweet but the point is that overall even basic bikini pics at a beach are as hot as the Charlotte McKinney nudes that came out a few weeks ago. The woman is just pure sex and everything I’ve ever dreamed of when I was a young boy drawing a stick figure with huge tits as my ideal woman. \nSo yes, I’m going to say this GIF of Charlotte McKinney is indeed bloggable. It’s courageous of me to write the blog, it’s courageous of you to read it, it’s courageous of her to jiggle that big ol titty. Here’s to courage! \n^I will never tire of this GIF either for the record. \nPS Does that GIF prove it’s a fake titty or am I perpetuating fake titty fake news? Someone has to ask the tough question.
