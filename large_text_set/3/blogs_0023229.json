That’s how you attack a point! \nIf dive comps are more your thing, all you need to do is pull up some pro Nepal replays from the last couple of months. You’ll find plenty of triple DPS builds, Mercy play, Winston play and everything in between. LG Evil went for a 2-2-2 build in the following clip, with heavy emphasis on Orb of Discord and Jake’s Pharah: \nBoth sides had no tanks when it came to taking the point, which made having good DPS even more critical. Jake went after the right targets at the right times, and Train was there to clean up. Did you notice the Orb of Harmony at the start of the play? If you find Mercy dull, Zenyatta pairs just as well with Pharah. You don’t need to babysit her, which gives you more time to land some headshots. Spatial control \nAs always, if you control space and dictate the pace of the fight, your team will do well in Overwatch. This goes double for certain maps such as Sanctum on Nepal, where the fighting space is compartmentalized and rather tight. LG Evil has already made quite a name for themselves with how they’ve been able to hold down crucial chokes and capture points with authority, like in the following clip: \nAfter flipping the point, LG applies some pressure and moves the fight to the entrance with a good combination of ultimates in the bank. When Renegades opts to flank right, Train goes Whole Hog with a boost to clear the area, sending a couple of targets plummeting off the map. Even if there’s very little communication happening on your team, always keep your eyes open for opportunities like this as Roadhog. Environmental and proximity kills are some of the most effective in the game. They remove threats much faster while giving your support some breathing room. \nOne of the biggest factors to take into consideration when you need to free up some space is Nano Boost, as you saw above. A clutch boost can be the difference between putting a team down and letting them find their footing again. It’s also instrumental when you need to get in the heads of your opponents. Think about Reinhardt and what he could do during a payload fight. He’s strong already, but now he’s packing even more of a punch and swinging with reckless abandon. Watch how LG uses a boosted Rein to clear a payload for a 2-point hold on King’s Row: \nWhile “only boost Rein” might be the mantra of certain ladder warriors, it’s not a bad idea on payload and control maps. At the very least, he’ll serve as a huge distraction and could force some mistakes. Just remember to take a second to see where your team is, who has ultimates ready, and how the other team is attacking. Never save your boost for too long as you can generate another in another few minutes. Orisa makes her esports debut \nOne cool thing about Carbon Series is that they don’t play on tournament realms. That means if something goes live for you, it goes live for them. Renegades brought out Orisa for just one play on Tuesday for shock factor, but they put her back in the closet pretty quick. Last night, LG Evil had Jake hop on the new tank for a little while and he had better results: \nAnti-air from a tank? Yes, please. You can immediately see the added value she’ll bring to esports and ladder compositions. Immortals also had a decent push with Orisa when they managed to force Complexity off a point on Nepal: What does the future hold? \nLuminosity has been in the middle of the North American pack for some time. In 2016, they performed well in some monthly tournaments and qualifiers, but only had a couple flashes in the pan at majors. Their Loyal squad has the talent, there’s no question about that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:08:17.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
