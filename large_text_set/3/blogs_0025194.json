Happy fucking Mother's Day 2 me! \nEarlier she had cryptically tweeted: \"Everyone butters their own buns! Trust me I'm sick of baking them and buying them for them! Make ur own money & don't abuse my kindness.\" Danniella needed to practice on the pole during her holidays (Photo: XPOSUREPHOTOS.COM) Danniella was very emotional (Photo: Twitter) Danniella and son Kai - he is working this weekend (Photo: Rex Features) \nFormer cocaine addict Danniella, who confessed she had snorted the drug while pregnant with her son and during her daughter's birth, has two children with ex-husband millionaire businessman Kevin Jenkins. \nLast year Danniella said she decided to do CBB to make her children proud. In a nod to her tumultuous relationship with her kids she said: \"I just wanted to make my kids proud of me, I'm sick of them having to defend me. Now they can go out and say, 'That's my mum, that's who she is, she's ok, she's not some messy drug addict'\" \nDanniella hit the headlines this month after her rather wild break in Marbs.

Showing off her toned tum and legs, Danniella made sure she gave punters an eyeful in her very high shorts. \nIt appeared the mum-of-two was a little out of practice as she flailed around the lower end - before triumphing as she managed to mount the silver pole.
