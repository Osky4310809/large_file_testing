We’re not talking about his contributions to The Apprentice , though, but to the groupings of TV personalities that have profited bigly from calling our new president and his team out on their rampant and fragrant bullshit. Saturday Night Live tops the list of shows getting the accidental Trump bump, but The Late Show With Stephen Colbert , and even the president’s hated nemeses at CNN, have all reported upticks in ratings after going all-in on Talkin’ Trump. \nNow you can add another quick-witted presidential critic to the list: Samantha Bee, whose TBS series Full Frontal has posted some of the most dramatic gains in the wake of the election. Driven by some of the sharpest, angriest satire of the administration currently in the running , Bee’s ratings have been climbing steadily since the lead-up to the 2016 election; she’s now nearly tripling the numbers from when she debuted back in February of 2016 . According to Variety , Bee is currently pulling in 2.5 million viewers per episode, beating out her former colleagues at The Daily Show . To be fair, Bee’s show only airs weekly, and technically runs during primetime, not late-night, but Variety still has a pretty impressive graph of the way her ratings have soared in recent months. Some of that is presumably just Bee finding the audience for her brand of mischievous, laser-focused satire, but we have to assume having a ripe target for her to hit has played its part as well.
