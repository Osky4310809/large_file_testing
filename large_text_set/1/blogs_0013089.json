Klopp tries desperately to get his men going...

But Klopp will be grateful that he picks Karius for the cups because he was just about the only Liverpool player to do himself justice. \nEven with Philippe Coutinho coming on as a late substitute, Liverpool just could not get going while Daniel Sturridge failed to grasp his opportunity up front and even Roberto Firmino was substituted. \nIt could - and probably should - have been all over and that is the only comfort for Liverpool. \nSouthampton, who have not won a major trophy for 41 years, let Klopp off the hook. \nLiverpool did not live up to their billing as red-hot favourites and Klopp has, in truth, suffered more than his fair share of disappointment in the cups. Nathan Redmond got the only goal — but should have had three (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nKlopp lost two finals last season - the League Cup and Europa League - while they were also held to a goalless draw by Plymouth in the FA Cup on Sunday. \nFor all the energy and promise Liverpool have shown in the Premier League this season, they looked flat and short of intensity. It was very hard to understand as this was by no means Klopp resting players and saving the big guns for the showdown with Manchester United on Sunday. \nIt was a near full strength line-up, bar perhaps injured captain Jordan Henderson and Sadio Mane, who is now away on Africa Cup of Nations duty. \nAnd how they missed them. \nLiverpool just did not produce on the night. \nIncredibly, this is the Reds’ 17th League Cup semi final and they have won the trophy eight times, so they should have not needed reminding it is an important competition.
