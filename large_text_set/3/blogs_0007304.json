It lets users store credit on the app for future rides and purchases. Credit points are deducted from the balance, which removes the friction of having to handle cash. Go-Pay credits can be used not only to pay for rides, but also for services and items purchased through the app.\nNow the startup introduced a new feature which allows users to send Go-Pay credit to each other at no cost. It’s a big step in Go-Jek’s evolution into an increasingly powerful payments solution that enables users to transact with each other.\nThe feature is only available to a subset of app users for now, a company spokesperson confirmed.\nThis is what it would look like if you are one of them.\nBelow your Go-Pay balance, there are additional options like transfer and withdrawal of credits.\nGo-Jek also confirmed that users will be able to withdraw Go-Pay credit in the form of cash at several partner banks once the feature is fully implemented. The startup has not yet revealed which banks are involved.\nThere is, however, one hoop users have to jump through to be able to make use of the feature. You have to get your account verified by uploading a photo and official ID.\n“We hope that through the addition of this feature to Go-Pay we can improve people’s experience with it and the Go-Jek app. The feature proves our commitment to push and promote the notion of a cashless society,” the spokesperson said.\nThis article first appeared in Indonesia, written by Prahariezka Arfienda Satrianti . \nThis post Go-Jek now lets users transfer e-cash to each other appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T09:43:34.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
