and stay ninth after suffering a second consecutive league defeat. \nPepe – in for the injured Sergio Ramos – squandered the first chance of the match, heading wide from Toni Kroos' corner. \nThe hosts dominated possession but did not threaten again until a rapid spell of attacks just after the half-hour mark, Cristiano Ronaldo firing wide after Lucas Vazquez had capitalised on a mistake from Pablo Piatti to create the shooting opportunity. \nMorata had the ball in the net a few moments later, but was denied by an offside flag after he had strayed beyond the last defender from Kroos' low cross. \nBut Morata scored one that did stand after 33 minutes, the Spain forward confidently heading into the bottom corner from six yards after Isco was allowed far too much time to float in a cross from the right. 14 - No other side has scored more headed goals than Real Madrid in Europe's top five leagues this season (level with AS Monaco).
