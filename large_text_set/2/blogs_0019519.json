Georgia performed heroically against the All Blacks in the 2015 World Cup \n\"There is no vacancy. Right now we are perfectly happy that we have the six strongest teams in Europe in our competition.\" \nHe said Italy's terrible form in this year's competition could not be taken in isolation, and urged their critics to take a longer view. New Zealand's Sonny Bill Williams is tackled during the match against Georgia \n\"You wait for the weakest animal to fall and you are on top of them,' he said. \"Are we closed to every scenario? No, but it takes a while to see a convincing argument - 10 or 15 years. \n\"We have to take a good, considered view about what is right for our six unions. They would all have to agree that this is what they want. At this stage, talk of bringing in other teams is premature.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:51:11.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
