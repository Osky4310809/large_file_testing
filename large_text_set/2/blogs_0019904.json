Madonna's twins singing (Photo: Instagram) \nIt's the second social media post Madonna's shared since Esther and Stella arrived in America. \nOn Saturday night, she posted a sweet video to Instagram showing the girls singing along as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star was played on the piano. \nThe post came shortly after the twins' father, Adam Mwale - who was in court for the adoption hearing earlier this month - claimed he was misled about the official agreement as he thought his children would be returned to him one day. \nHe told the Daily Mail: \"I was told from the start that Esther and Stella were going to a rich woman's home abroad, that she would give them a good education, then return them to me, to live with me and help all of my family.

That cannot be true - I don't want it to be true. I am their father and I will always be their father.\" \nAdam claims he was told Madonna wanted to take the twins and educate them and when he consulted his late wife's family, they agreed it would be a fantastic opportunity for the girls and he should go ahead. \nThe 40-year-old farmer - whose wife Patricia died while giving birth to the twins - claimed a court appointed guardian told \"terrible lies\" and told the judge he had abandoned his family, including five other children aged between eight and 20, to marry another woman.

She returned to the country David last year so he could receive his tribal name. \nShe adopted Mercy three years later. \nMadonna recently spoke about her love for Malawi in an interview with Billboard, saying: \"I’ve been working in Malawi for over a decade. I have a huge commitment and love for the country and I will never desert them. \n\"I adopted my two children that I’m so lucky to have living in my house right now.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:55:42.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
