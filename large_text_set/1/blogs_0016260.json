India's senior pros stitched a mammoth 256-run stand for the fourth wicket to help the hosts recover from the early Chris Woakes strikes that left India reeling at 25 for 3 in the fifth over. \nYuvraj was at his regal best from the get go, unleashing a series of eye-pleasing drives and pulls while Dhoni dropped anchor to let the left-hander dominate the early parts of the innings before coming into his own at the death to power the hosts to a gargantuan total. \nFor a second game in the series, the teams were welcomed by a benign-looking pitch and with the possibility of dew later in the evening, Eoin Morgan had little qualms in inviting India to take first strike. The first ball of the innings - with KL Rahul cover-driving for four - served as an eerie premonition of things to come even if England's bowlers, Woakes in particular, did admirably well to win the first bout in the opening powerplay. \nThe England seamer was quick to realise the folly of operating on a fuller length after Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan scored a sequence of flowing cover drives. Woakes was rewarded with the wicket of Rahul the minute he pulled back the length a touch. The Karnataka batsman nicked off to second slip for a second failure of the series. Virat Kohli walked out to a raucous ovation from the international cricket-starved Barabati crowd and instantly served up a gorgeous straight drive to underscore his purple patch. After hitting another off-drive, Kohli succumbed to a surprising indecision in footwork with Woakes double-bluffing the Indian captain with a full ball and Morgan persisting with Ben Stokes at second slip, who completed a sharp catch to his left. \nWhen Dhawan dragged a delivery on to his stumps in the following over, India were faced with yet another rebuilding job. But they had the men with the experience for the very job. Notwithstanding the situation, Yuvraj took the counter-attacking route out of trouble beginning with a hat-trick of boundaries of Jake Ball even as Dhoni played out successive maidens off Woakes, who finished a highly-impressive opening spell with figures of 5-3-14-3. \nBut even as Dhoni plodded his way to singles, Yuvraj stayed in his element, using his leverage to pull deliveries both in-front and behind square with metronomic precision. England, who'd picked an extra seamer in Liam Plunkett for Adil Rashid, overdid their use of the short delivery, particularly on a ground with short square boundaries. \nYuvraj reached his half-century off 56 deliveries while Dhoni took 67 for his feat. The duo picked up pace through the middle phase of the innings, as Yuvraj slammed his 150th six enroute scoring his first ODI century since March 2011. The partnership chugged past one milestone after another, eventually finishing with 256 - the highest fourth-wicket stand against England in ODIs. After Yuvraj's dismissal, Dhoni turned aggressor - eventually finishing with half a dozen sixes as India, helped by smaller cameos from Kedar Jadhav and Hardik Pandya, added 120 in the final 10. But as even Yuvraj agreed at the end of his blinder, no score is safe in ODIs anymore. \nBrief Scores: India 381/6 in 50 overs (Yuvraj Singh 150, MS Dhoni 134; Chris Woakes 4-60) vs England © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T14:46:51.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
