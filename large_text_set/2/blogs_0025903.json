Action!\" Stephanie Strasburg 100.7 Star's Bubba interviews Anne Stone on the red carpet with the help of Emilio Cornacchione. By Natalie Bencivenga   \nWhen and where: Sunday night at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown. \n#LetsGoToTheMovies: The Pittsburgh Film Office’s party just keeps getting better! Here were some highlights from this one enchanted evening: \nRed Carpet Magic: This year’s red carpet clocked in at 515 feet — longer than the one in Hollywood! Lining the red carpet were glamorous drag queens like Bebe Beretta, Tootsie Snyder, Bambi Deerest and others channeling the movie stars from yesteryear. Izzazu’s Glam Cam caught all the action with Bubba from 100.7 and Emilio Cornachione interviewing guests as they strutted their stuff for the camera. \nBubbles, anyone? The drinks were flowing and at the center of it all was an 8-foot-high champagne glass complete with Bubbles the Champagne Goddess lounging for all to see (and admire). \n#RatedPGH: Once the doors to the ballroom opened, the party kicked off with an original opening number by the Craig Zinger singers as guests enjoyed signature drinks in honor of “Outsiders,” filmed in Pittsburgh. Ever tasted a Li’l Foster, a cranberry moonshine cosmo? “It’s sentimental to have all of these Pittsburgh big-screen moments here with us tonight,” said PFO director Dawn Keezer, who was dripping in diamonds (naturally!) from Brilliant Nuevo Diamonds. “We are so thrilled to have such support here to keep producing films and television shows in our city.” \n#LetsParty: Guests noshed on a Dunkin’ Donuts doughnut wall, Millies Ice Cream, dessert-themed waffles from Waffleonia and savory treats from Levy Restaurants before dancing to the Totally 80s band and playing retro games like Atari. It was a night to remember! \n#SEEN: Co-emcees Sally Wiggin and Michelle Wright, Gino Chiodo, honorary co-chairs Pete and Lori Schoonmaker, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, Lt.
