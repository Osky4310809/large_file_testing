Well, it’s still a while until an official next-generation iPhone reveal, but well-placed industry insiders are suggesting that the Cupertino-based company could be set to introduce new hardware to the market within the next couple of weeks. \nThe analysts in questions are suggesting that reputable sources are feeding them information about a possible hardware reveal by Apple this month, likely between Monday, March 20, and Friday, March 24. \nThis immediately rings bell around the rumored Spring event . Apple was initially tipped to hold the event early next month , but it looks as though it could actually be within the next ten days. Of course, there’s also the possibility that Apple will not even see the need to hold a dedicated media event, and will simply use a number of press releases to announce any hardware improvements in the iPad range to the world. \nWe can instantly rule out a new iPhone as part of that product reveal, with there being no reason to suspect that Apple will deviate away from its annual twelve month smartphone refresh. A refreshed Apple TV could be on the agenda, but given the number of iPad-related reports and conjecture we’ve been seeing, it is much more likely that the product, or products, in question could be the new trio of iPads that we have been hearing about so frequently over the last few months. \nA number of well-placed and prominent analysts have already put themselves on record starting their belief that Apple will release a trio of iPad Pro 2 hardware sooner rather than later. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities , Blayne Curtis of Barclays , and hit-and-miss publisherd Macotakara , have all been suggesting that new iPad hardware is imminent. \nThey all even agree on the potential for Apple to introduce a revamped 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro, as well as giving a brand new 10.5-inch model the chance to shine in the packed tablet marketplace. In addition to the iPad reveal, the Japanese blog Macotakara has also suggested that a number of new Apple Watch bands will be introduced during the dedicated media event. \nAs mentioned earlier, previous speculation had pointed to an April 4th event, likely to be held in the new Steve Jobs Theater within Apple Park, but that’s definitely up in the air now with this new information. Let’s hope we get some official Apple invites soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:53:43.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
