"text": "Mar 30, 2017 at 3:42p ET 0 \nWhat's a new MLB season without some award predictions? \nThe preseason envelope, please! USA TODAY Sports David Richard NL MVP: Bryce Harper, Nationals \nVegas is getting the Raiders. Vegas also is getting three straight NL MVPs (Harper in 2015, Kris Bryant in ’16, Harper again). I don’t know what the heck happened to Harper after mid-May last season, but my suspicion is that his struggles resulted in part from some type of injury. Well, he worked out like a demon in the offseason, and he’s too smart not to figure out the rest. \nI nearly picked the Mets’ Yoenis Cespedes; whoever stays healthier, he or Harper, will win the award. USA TODAY Sports Jasen Vinlove AL MVP: Francisco Lindor, Indians \nI know, I know – it looks like I’m aligning with the Anyone But Trout voting bloc that I’ve criticized in the past. Chances are, Trout again will finish first or second, as he has in each of the past five seasons. It will take an extraordinary performance to beat him, and Lindor is just the man for the job. His defense, high-on-base percentage, energy and leadership will compensate for his relative lack of power. \nLindor is a shining light for the sport, the player with the best chance to become the next Derek Jeter. USA TODAY Sports Joe Camporeale NL Cy Young: Clayton Kershaw, Dodgers \nPractically a lock as long as he stays healthy. Kershaw finished fifth in the voting for this award last season despite pitching only 149 innings, and his mound demeanor this spring indicates that if anything, he is only ramping up his intensity. \nNever rule out the Nationals’ Max Scherzer, one of only six pitchers to win Cys in both leagues. But I’ll go with the guy who posted ERAs of 1.83 or below in three of his past four seasons – and a 2.13 in his “clunker.” USA TODAY Sports Joe Camporeale AL Cy Young: Jose Quintana, White Sox/Astros \nHow convenient! Quintana will be traded within the AL, keeping his candidacy viable. Seriously, I can’t talk myself into any of the other obvious contenders. \nThe Indians’ Corey Kluber, Tigers’ Justin Verlander and Red Sox’s Rick Porcello will find it difficult to repeat their excellent 2016s. Chris Sale will pay what Bill James calls the “transition tax,” the price that players pay as they adjust to their first year in Boston. The Blue Jays’ Aaron Sanchez is coming off a big innings jump. The Rangers’ Yu Darvish has pitched only 244 1/3 innings the past three seasons. \nGive me Quintana, poor run support in Chicago and all. Kamil Krzaczynski USA TODAY Sports NL Manager: Torey Lovullo, Diamondbacks \nVoters often prefer managers from teams that exceed expectations, so I’m ruling out the obvious choices from contenders – the Dodgers’ Dave Roberts, Cubs’ Joe Maddon, Nationals’ Dusty Baker, etc. I would have picked the Rockies’ Bud Black if not for the team’s recent run of injuries. \nDo I envision the D-backs as serious contenders? No. But can they be enough of a surprise to elevate Lovullo in his first season? Sure. USA TODAY Sports Rick Scuteri AL Manager: A.J. Hinch, Astros \nFind me a surprise team in the AL; it isn’t easy. I don’t have enough faith in the starting pitching of the Mariners and Yankees to pick Scott Servais or Joe Girardi. The Tigers’ Brad Ausmus would be a fun choice, considering that some fans wanted him fired at the end of the last season. So would that ever-popular pin cushion, the Royals’ Ned Yost. But neither team is likely to play well enough to justify their selections. \nI’ll go with the chalk – Hinch, who finished second to the Rangers’ Jeff Banister in 2015. USA TODAY Sports Troy Taormina NL Rookie: Josh Bell, Pirates \nBraves shortstop Dansby Swanson is the favorite, and I generally lean toward up-the-middle defenders over first basemen such as Bell. What’s more, Swanson (.803 OPS) outhit Bell (.775) during their initial auditions last season. \nI’m just guessing Bell will be the better hitter over 162 games – and I don’t rule out his teammate, right-hander Tyler Glasnow, as a darkhorse. USA TODAY Sports Charles LeClaire AL Rookie: Andrew Benintendi, Red Sox \nThe competition appears less fierce in the AL, and Benintendi’s offensive potential makes him an obvious choice; the Red Sox have considered batting him third, and likely will hit him second. As I wrote earlier this spring , Hall of Famer Jim Rice views Benintendi as “the second coming of Fred Lynn” – a player who not only was AL Rookie of the Year in 1975, but also MVP. USA TODAY Sports Reinhold Matay NL Comeback Player: Kyle Schwarber, Cubs \nActually, Schwarber should have won the award last year for starring in the World Series after appearing in only two regular-season games due to knee surgery. USA TODAY Sports Matt Kartozian AL Comeback Player: Pablo Sandoval, Red Sox \nSandoval, who appeared in only three games last season before undergoing surgery on his left shoulder, seems hellbent on reviving his career – and at 30, that should be quite possible. USA TODAY Sports Jasen Vinlove Executive: Jeff Luhnow, Astros \nPut it this way: Luhnow had better win the award, seeing as how Sports Illustrated promised in June 2014 that the Astros would be, “Your 2017 World Series champs.” \nThe addition of Quintana – or Sonny Gray, or Chris Archer – would complete the Astros’ transformation, complementing prior moves for first baseman Yuli Gurriel, catcher Brian McCann, left fielder Carlos Beltran and right fielder Josh Reddick. USA TODAY Sports Troy Taormina Biggest name traded at deadline: Zach Britton, Orioles \nI’ll admit that I’m going for shock value; I actually expect Quintana, the Pirates’ Andrew McCutchen and Brewers’ Ryan Braun all to get moved, and possibly the Royals’ Eric Hosmer, too. \nA trade of Britton would require a rare concession from the Orioles, but their questionable starting pitching might warrant such a move. Aroldis Chapman and Andrew Miller brought back monster returns last season, Chapman with two months of control, Miller with two-plus years. Britton at the deadline will have one-plus years remaining. USA TODAY Sports Jonathan Dyer First manager fired: None \nThis used to be an interesting category, back when front offices viewed managers as something more than information-dispensing functionaries. Now, it’s almost as if managers are not viewed as important enough to dismiss in-season – the Braves’ Fredi Gonzalez was the only one let go during the 2016 campaign. \nEnd of the season, different story. The Twins’ Paul Molitor, working under a new front office, might be among those in jeopardy then. USA TODAY Sports Kim Klement Best report by a Fake Ken Rosenthal on Twitter: Yankees acquire Kris Bryant from Cubs for infielder Gleyber Torres, reliever Dellin Betances and pitching prospects James Kaprelian and Jordan Montgomery \nAlas, the fake Kens always come up with bigger bombshells than the original with the blue checkmark. Look for more of the same in ’17. USA TODAY Sports Rick Scuteri", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:19:15.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
