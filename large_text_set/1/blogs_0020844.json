If the voting system changes to be more proportional, Cullen said, Canadians can expect “a couple of cooks in the kitchen,” which will avoid letting one party or the prime minister “have their way no matter what.”\nIn the Liberals’ online experiment, just over 60 per cent strongly agreed or somewhat agreed “it is better for several parties to have to govern together than for one party to make all the decisions in government,” and almost 70 per cent strongly agreed or somewhat agreed “a party that wins the most seats in an election should still have to compromise with other parties, even if it means reconsidering some of its policies.”\nStill, people aren’t keen to crowd the electoral scene, with 59 per cent preferring a few big parties to many small ones.\nRelated Most Canadians like current voting system, much-criticized Liberal electoral reform survey finds Andrew Coyne: Biggest problem with MyDemocracy survey is the questions Don’t blame electoral reform committee for ‘ridiculous’ survey questions, enraged MP says Those opinions come from a pool of several hundred thousand people, with results weighted based on such demographic information as age, gender and region. Questions about specific voting systems or referendums were not part of the survey.\nAlthough the report says Canadians “generally prefer a deliberative government,” results related to parties working together weren’t highlighted in the executive summary of the report compiled by Vox Pop Labs.\nThe report does conclude Canadians broadly support more freedom for MPs; support limits to the length of election campaigns; oppose mandatory voting; oppose lowering the voting age; and oppose online voting when there are security concerns.\nAbout two-thirds of Canadians are “generally satisfied with Canada’s democracy.”\n“I’m satisfied with Canadian democracy compared to Russia or China or the U.S. right now,” Green Party leader Elizabeth May said. But it would be “unconscionably misleading” to infer from the question that people are satisfied specifically with Canada’s voting system, she said. “That question wasn’t asked.”\nSaid Cullen: “It’s like asking people if they’re happy with dinner. Are they good with the idea of dinner? Yeah, but between filet mignon and a bowl of porridge, is there any distinction?” In not including the collaboration-related responses in an executive summary, he said, “the interpretation is biased.”\nThe committee recommended the government hold a referendum on changing the current first-past-the-post electoral system — which can (and has lately) result in one-party majority governments — to a proportional system, where seat counts more closely reflect vote counts for each political party, making majorities unlikely.\nThat 70 per cent of people want parties to “collectively agree” is a “clear indicator of people who support proportional representation,” May said.\n“We understand that the intense hyper-partisanship that we see in parliament is partially due, and I think entirely due, to the incentives that are built into first-past-the-post to constantly deride any party but your own. … Canadians are very sick of that.”\nMay said the committee heard that other countries, such as New Zealand, have switched to proportional representation and seen a culture shift where parties work more collaboratively.\nStill, arguing for caution, Conservative MP Scott Reid said “actionable information” is hard to come by because questions were too vague and could be interpreted in many ways.\n“Given the ambiguity of some of the questions, presumably it was designed to give the minister and the government maximum freedom to read into the results most useful to them,” Reid said. “What they interpret this as saying is far more useful information to us than what this actually says.”\nCullen has proposed to the new minister of democratic institutions, Karina Gould, that parties work together to draft legislation on electoral reform. He said he hadn’t yet received a response. Gould’s office said she was not available for an interview.\n• Email: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: amariedanielles \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T03:00:22.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
