Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIt would be the sort of deal that might even bring a grin to Daniel Levy ’s poker face. \nPay £5million for a League One player and sell him for £70m two years later. \nKer-ching. \nThat’s one of the new stands paid for. \nCall it the Dele Alli Stand, perhaps. \nNot only that, you don’t have to pay him the £150,000 a week he will probably soon be demanding and have Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Co banging on your door pretty quickly. \nSo, if Real Madrid, Barcelona or Paris Saint-Germain come calling – and Pochettino hardly put them off the scent by describing Alli as “very special”, with “unbelievable qualities” and “one of the best players in the Premier League” – Levy might be tempted. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino's future could be linked to Dele Alli staying at the club (Photo: AFP) \nIt might even represent good business. \nAlli has not been consistently brilliant and has a lot of maturing to do. \nBut if there is one stand-out reason, among many, why Levy should not be ­countenancing ANY offer, it is ­Pochettino himself. \nBy lavishing yet more praise on Alli, Pochettino was as good as telling the Spurs board, “Sell him and I’m off too”. \nAnd losing one of the best young managers in the game would be disastrous. Pochettino signed a new contract last year, tying him to the club until 2021. \nBut it would be ­astonishing if there was no sort of release clause. Make no mistake, Pochettino is an ambitious coach and his ambitions extend beyond scrapping for a top-four place and flogging your best players.
