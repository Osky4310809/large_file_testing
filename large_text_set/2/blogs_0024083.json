By our estimation, this rescue dog hugging its new human is the most heartbreaking, wonderful thing you’ve ever seen, and we’re willing to bet you will melt when you see it.\nSo, there’s actually a scientific reason why we really shouldn’t hug dogs , but we don’t even want to imagine what type of monster would reject a dog’s hug (AKA the best embrace you’ll ever receive).\n\nvia GIPHY \nWhile there are many dog-obsessed people who will back up that claim, we are beyond certain that we can count on Kayla Filoon, who recently adopted a Pit Bull named Russ from Philadelphia’s Animal Care and Control Team.
