Yet appear on resale sites. #Metallica \" \nAnother user, @Theavgbloke , echoed her annoyance: \" @TicketmasterUK @Metallica Logged on 15mins before on sale, watched it count down, when it reached zero it said no tickets available...\" \nBut some went to extreme lengths to ensure they didn't miss the chance to see the US heavy metal band live. \nAs @KaneNielsen wrote on Twitter: \"Our English teacher got all of us in the class to wait for the Metallica tickets to go live so we get them for him before they sold out.\" \nIt seems the extreme tactic paid off because the teacher got his tickets. Read More Metallica UK tour tickets to go on sale TODAY for European leg of the WorldWired tour this autumn \nTicketmaster are now claiming the best bet for fans hoping to buy tickets is to opt for more expensive VIP packages that can cost Â£200+. \nThe ticket site tweeted to followers: \"Update on @Metallica ! Your best bet for tickets now is with VIP Whiplash and Unforgiven packages: http://bit.ly/2mXJYGe \" Where to find tickets to sold-out shows? \nIf you're still trying to get your hands on tickets, here are a few top tips on where to find them. \nSign up to Ticketmaster 's newsletters and follow them on social media, there are rumours that the ticketing site is hoping to release more Metallica tickets. Staying in the loop will increase your chances of actually getting the tickets you want, for the dates and locations you desire the most. \nSign up to Metallica's fan club - you'll get early access to any future pre-sale tickets . Although it's too late for this set of dates, there's always a (slim) chance more advanced tickets for extra dates will be released later on down the line. And you'll want to ensure you don't miss out on those. \nTry resale sites. But be careful and ensure you don't get ripped off or massively overcharged. Ticketmaster's secondary ticketing site GETMEIN , Stubhub and Ticket Factory are all selling Metallica tickets right now.
