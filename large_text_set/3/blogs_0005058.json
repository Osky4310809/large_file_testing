I left the private sector for seven years to volunteer full-time to help public education because I just couldn't stand by and watch while kids who grew up in our city and didn't have the same access to a life-changing quality public education that I did. \nBut I've never really acknowledged that my peers who grew up with me during that same era but attended under-resourced schools south of Interstate-30 never had the same shot at the American Dream that I did. And that matters. \nIt might feel convenient and comfortable for some of us who weren't guiding the city during decades of legally-sanctioned housing and school racial segregation to ask that we just move on and focus on the future. But we simply can't. \nPast policies and practices continue to reverberate across our city today. Acknowledging our past and learning from it, while respectfully working with others, will keep us from repeating our mistakes and perpetuating that which we had hoped to change. \nThat acknowledgement includes explicitly saying never again and holding ourselves accountable to that pledge by publicly and transparently assessing the equity gaps in our city and aligning our actions and funding to close them. \nBut as we discuss and debate, we can't forget about the students whose futures continue to be determined every day in schools and classrooms across our city. They are counting on us adults and elders to forge a path that doesn't hold them hostage to the wounds of our history, a path that is mindful of the time they won't get back while solutions are formed. \nThey need us to search for strategies that close opportunity gaps and, when we find them, to robustly and equitably fund these solutions to accelerate progress aggressively on their behalf. \nWhen Dallas ISD's expansion of quality pre-K helps keeps our youngest students from ever falling behind, we should scale it and do so in partnership with quality private providers otherwise impacted in those communities. \nWhen the district considers phasing out suspensions that disproportionately remove students of color from learning environments while contributing to the school-to-prison pipeline, we should support it but also provide teachers with the necessary training to navigate the change. \nI believe we are all somewhere on this continuum between the pain of the past, the urgency of the present and the promise of a brighter future. At times, I with others place the urgency of the moment, our own sense of needing to act quickly on behalf of kids first, before the need to first develop greater trust across lines of historical division in our city. My pledge is to gather broad community input and seek out a point of equilibrium while asking others to do the same. \nIf the prize is that the incredible talents and contributions of our children no longer go to waste, then it will be well worth it. \nTodd Williams is the executive director of The Commit Partnership.
