Two cases developed pulmonary hemorrhage and one died as a result of infection.” \nThe remaining two patients recovered and were discharged, Daskalakis added. \n“The Health Department is working with building owners in the affected area to remediate rodent infestations,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:17:44.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
