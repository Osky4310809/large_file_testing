Rather, you’ll have to travel deep into the Savannah to find her, and she’ll probably be splashing around in the water and/or rolling in the mud. Or both! Disney’s Animal Kingdom just welcomed a new lil’ elephant to their herd at Kilimanjaro Safaris, and you are going to fall in love with her instantly.\nEarlier today, the Disney Park’s Blog announced that one of their female elephants, Donna, had just given birth to a new baby. Disney’s named the new baby Stella, and you haven’t experienced pure joy and happiness until you see Stella running around the watering hole, giant-ears flapping at her side.\n\nAs the Disney Park’s Blog writes, Stella is now the seventh baby elephant born at Animal Kingdom , and she’s got two older sisters already — Nadirah and Luna. Stella’s already spent time backstage Animal Kingdom with her mom learning the ropes of how-to-be-an-elephant, and “getting to know some of the other elephants in her family.” If that’s not the most adorable thing you’ll hear about today, we’re not sure what is.\nA few guests have already spotted Stella on Kilimanjaro Safaris, and the reaction is the same every time: OMG.\nI JUST SAW A 3 WEEK OLD ELEPHANT AT DISNEY HER NAME IS STELLA SHE IS SO SMALL\n— jordan (@jordyshot) January 4, 2017 A video posted by News 6 WKMG (@news6wkmg) on Jan 4, 2017 at 1:40pm PST \nA photo posted by Rainey Why Travel There (@mylandofoz) on Jan 4, 2017 at 12:40pm PST \nBREAKING NEWS.
