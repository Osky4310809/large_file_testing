Thirty or 40 people. We would take them in desert and kill them,” he claimed. \n“I would sit them down, put a blindfold on them and fire a bullet into their heads.” \nHe also reportedly told of how he raped hundreds of women, after being given permission by his emirs to attack as many as he wanted. \nAmar Hussein spoke to journalists from behind bars after his capture. \nCounter-terrorism agents said he was troubled when he first arrived in jail. \n“He was so strong he snapped the plastic handcuffs off his wrists,” said one. \nDuring the interview, Amar also reportedly revealed how he joined the terror group aged 14 and went on to join al-Qaeda. \nHe even claimed he is a victim of poverty in Mosul, where he apparently grew up in a broken home and had no-one to give him advice. \nNow, he said he reads the Q’uran all day in his tiny jail cell to become a better person.
