On Monday, the NFL announced the jersey had been found through the cooperation of the league’s security team and the FBI. \nThe jersey, valued at $500,000, would fetch a hefty price on the memorabilia market. The league said that the jersey had been found in the possession of someone who had posed as a member of the international media. \nIn an unexpected twist, the league also announced that this person also had Brady’s jersey from the Patriots Super Bowl XLIX win over the Seattle Seahawks . Until Monday, that missing jersey hadn’t made headlines. But the fact that it had also been stolen may be part of the reason that the jersey from Super Bowl LI became such a big story. \nHere’s a complete timeline of the theft and recovery of Tom Brady’s missing jerseys: \nFeb. 1, 2015 - Patriots win Super Bowl XLIX; Brady’s jersey goes missing While it wasn’t publicized, someone walked off with Brady’s game-worn jersey from New England’s 28-24 Super Bowl win over the Seahawks. \nFeb. 5, 2017 - Patriots win Super Bowl LI; Brady’s jersey goes missing again Brady and the Patriots executed a dramatic comeback win over the Atlanta Falcons, taking a Super Bowl to overtime for the first time in NFL history. After the game, Brady discovered that his jersey was missing . He appeared to be “flustered” and immediately enlisted help from team equipment managers and security personnel. \nEXCLUSIVE VIDEO - #TomBrady 's jersey goes missing after the @Patriots win in #SuperBowl - @YahooSports pic.twitter.com/J49dRMNdTY \n— Alan Springer (@AlanSpringer) February 6, 2017 Feb. 6, 2017 - Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick enlists the aid of the Texas Rangers Patrick cited the state of Texas’ commitment to hospitality as he charged the Texas Rangers (the law enforcement agency, not the baseball team ) with finding Brady’s missing jersey. \n\"In Texas we place a very high value on hospitality and football,\" Patrick said, according to the Texas Tribune . \" Tom Brady's jersey has great historical value and is already being called 'the most valuable NFL collectable ever.' It will likely go into the Hall of Fame one day. It is important that history does not record that it was stolen in Texas.\" \nFeb. 8, 2017 - Houston police chief is less than enthused about tracking down the jersey The Houston Police Department was also on the case, as it was clearly its jurisdiction. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo tried to keep things in perspective. \n“It might be the highest priority for [the] lieutenant governor,” Acevedo said via The Statesman . “I can tell you we had three homicides the night of the Super Bowl in the city of Houston, and we’d like to find it. But I don’t think we’re burning the midnight oil worrying about a jersey.”\nFeb. 10, 2017 - Patriots hope Brady’s missing jersey is just on the equipment truck Law enforcement hoped that the jersey, and James White’s game-winning touchdown ball, would be found on the Patriots equipment truck . The truck had not been thoroughly searched, but when it was unloaded, the jersey was not there. White’s touchdown ball was found , though details on its recovery are unavailable. \nFeb. 14, 2017 - Robert Kraft compares Brady’s jersey to “a great Chagall or Picasso” “It’s very sad to me that someone would do something like this. It’s like taking a great Chagall or Picasso or something. You can never display it. And somehow, I feel there’ll be some news that’ll clear this up in the not-too-distant future,” Kraft said to Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo .\nYes, he really said that . \nFeb. 21, 2017 - Brady’s jersey valued at $500,000 in police report Maybe the jersey isn’t quite as valuable as priceless works of art , but $500,000 is still a pretty penny. That’s how it was valued in a Houston Police Department report obtained by TMZ . \nFeb. 22, 2017 - Tom Brady initiates his own search for the missing jersey Brady’s elaborate suspect board included Lady Gaga , Gollum, and Julian Edelman. It did not, however, appear to include anyone posing as a member of the international media. So maybe this investigation was better left to professionals.\nMarch 20, 2017 - Brady’s Super Bowl LI and Super Bowl XLIX jerseys are recovered with help from the FBI The NFL confirmed Jay Glazer’s report that league security, working in tandem with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, had recovered Brady’s missing jerseys . The jerseys were found in the possession of a person who had posed as a member of the international media, according to the league’s statement. \nOne might think the FBI would have more pressing issues to attend to, but it had to become involved because the theft of Brady’s jerseys was an international issue. \nGlazer said on Fox Sports’ Undisputed on Monday that the person who took the jersey had followed Bill Belichick into the Patriots locker room after the game. Video from the locker room revealed that this “person of interest” was carrying a backpack and left with something under his arm. \nAcevedo tweeted that the Houston Major Offenders division had located the jerseys in Mexico. He confirmed that the jerseys had been recovered with assistance from Mexican authorities. \nGlazer noted that the Broncos believe the same person may have taken Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller’s cleats and jersey following Denver’s win. \nThe NFL is referring all questions about the case to the FBI, because the investigation is ongoing.
