Events & Attractions Things to do in London this weekend \nValentine's is getting off to an early start, but there's plenty else to distract yourself with, says David Ellis Friday 10 February 2017 15:52 GMT Click to followES Going Out One night only: Whoopi Goldberg is performing her stand-up set for the first time in the UK this weekend \nWhether you're all loved up or sick to death of red roses, there's plenty on this weekend to cheer up February. \nOur ideal weekend this week would be cocktails at the Bloomsbury Bar followed by a trip to the cinema to see the new Lego Batman film. 1. Get a head start on Valentine’s \nFor those determined to go above and beyond the usual M&S Dine In For £10 this year, London is as busy as ever for hopeless romantics, last-chancers and the in-betweens. From the most romantic bars in London to, er, dinner with your dog, there’s something for everyone. \nInfo: From now, across London, standard.co.uk London's most romantic restaurants 1/20 Bob Bob Ricard \nBob Bob Ricard Soho This sexy Soho spot is glamorous, fun and endlessly impressive — if not at all cheap. Highlights of the 20s style décor include the ‘press for Champagne’ button, while the kiev is a must-try from the Russia-meets-Europe menu. So long as a spot of garlic won’t kill the mood, that is. 2/20 Galvin La Chapelle \nSpitalfields This high-ceilinged, architecturally stunning former chapel makes an impressive backdrop for French-minded fine-dining, with doting but not disruptive service sealing the deal. This is romance at its most classic. 3/20 London Shell Co \nMaida Vale Go one step further than a waterside view and take your date onto the canal for a scenic boat ride while they tuck into dinner. If the setting wasn't romantic enough, there are also oysters on the menu - just might want to make sure they don't get sea sick. 4/20 Clos Maggiore \nCovent Garden It’s been voted London’s most romantic restaurant time and time again, and has the stats to back it up — the restaurant is witness to several marriage proposals each week. The winning formula includes high-end French food, a stellar wine list, slick service, a cosy open fire and a glass roof showing off the starry night sky. What more could you want? 5/20 Boundary Rooftop \nShoreditch Occupying an enviable spot overlooking the City and Shoreditch, Boundary’s rooftop — complete with decking and lemon trees — feels like a slice of the Med in London. Because the weather is unlikely to match its appearance, it’s also entirely weatherproof and heated, allowing for scenic views without the shivers. The menu includes a delicious selection of oysters and fruits de mer as well as mezze and tapas-style sharing plates and grilled meat and fish from the robata grill. As well as access to the main restaurant’s extensive wine list, there’s a dedicated gin & tonic selection as well as aperitivo cocktails. 6/20 Andrew Edmunds \nSoho Relaxed but smart with an exceptionally well-priced wine list, Andrew Edmunds is quite rightly a Soho classic. It oozes a romantic old-school charm, especially of an evening when it is tightly packed and lit almost entirely by the wine bottles filled with candles that adorn each table. 7/20 Petersham Nurseries \nRichmond Who said that romantic had to mean low lit, candles and corners? The stunning floral-flanked setting of the greenhouses at Petersham Nurseries offer a loved-up vibe of an entirely different kind and the pretty setting is matched by equally beautiful plates of fresh, seasonal food. A good bet for a lunchtime date, followed by a stroll through Richmond Park or along the river. 8/20 The Wolseley \nPiccadilly It may be large and bustling rather than intimate, but this exquisite high-octane brasserie from Corbin & King makes for a mighty impressive date place nonetheless. Steak tartare, oysters, shellfish and schnitzels are among the highlights — some of which are more classic aphrodisiacs than others. 9/20 Le Pont De La Tour \nShad Thames This classic French restaurant which majors in seafood has a particularly special feature up its sleeves — breathtaking views of Tower Bridge and the Thames. Obviously you should be gazing into your partner’s eyes for most of the meal, but should that not be the case you won’t be short of somewhere to look. Adrian Franklin / D&D London 10/20 Wright Brothers \nVarious locations What better for a romantic meal than oysters? And where better to get them than Wright Brothers? The restaurant group also sells wholesale and has its own oyster farm in Cornwall. While the original Borough Market site is cosy and charming — though often packed — the newer South Kensington venue comes complete with the elegant downstairs Mermaid cocktail bar. Because the oysters are fairly good value, you’ll be able to consume more of their aphrodisiac goodness. 11/20 Aurora \nSoho This longstanding spot on a Soho sidestreet feels much less central than it is, thanks to classy but informal service and intimate tables. Its good value menu spans French, Italian and British classics and is matched with a decent selection of Old World wines. Great for date night on a budget. 12/20 Duck & Waffle \nCity There’s one very obvious reason why Duck & Waffle features in this list — the views. The restaurant is the highest in London and it has the impressive outlook to match. That said, there are plenty of other reasons to come. The modern British food, overseen by exec chef — Dan Doherty — is an impressive affair in itself, and given it’s open 24 hours, any time is good for a date. 13/20 La Poule Au Pot \nChelsea Featuring rustic stone walls and an abundance of candles, this brasserie delivers a slice of rural France to the streets off Sloane Square. Escargot steak frites and rabbit in mustard sauce are among the classics served alongside a well-priced all-French wine list. 14/20 Rules \nCovent Garden Laying claim to the title of London’s oldest restaurant, Rules has character by the bucket load. Cosy up with your date on one of their cosy red banquettes and lose yourselves in a time gone by. Its traditional menu majors on game, while oysters are also a popular choice. 15/20 Little Social \nMayfair This smaller off-shoot of Jason Atherton’s Pollen Street Social offers some of the city’s best European dishes in an intimate though bustling bistro setting. Leather booths, warm lighting and great cocktails will make a date all the more romantic. 16/20 The Ledbury \nNotting Hill This isn’t your average date night restaurant — it has two Michelin stars and is considered one of the nation’s very best. But it’s clever but relatively straightforward produce-led plates are sure to woo any dinner guest who fancies the best that money can buy without the pomp often associated with it. 17/20 Le Gavroche \nMayfair Let’s be clear; this is very much a special occasion kind of a place. Michel Roux Jnr’s exquisite French restaurant is unbeatable for old-school fine-dining, but it has two Michelin stars and a price to match. 18/20 Zelman Meats \nSoho Now, this isn’t your most classically romantic of restaurants — it’s casual, busy and oh so Soho. But if your date is of a carnivorous mindset, then it’s hard to beat this spot for succulent, sexy strips of steak at a very affordable price. Plus there are both oysters and uber-buttery mash, which is pretty romantic - no? 19/20 Bleeding Heart \nClerkenwell Gutsy French classics are served with rustic flair at both the Bleeding Heart bistro and restaurant, with the restaurant upping the level of formality just slightly. Intimate, well-spaced tables ensure you don’t share your date with the table next door while an excellent wine list will ensure you don’t run dry. 20/20 Bel Canto \nBayswater Disclaimer: this is not for everyone and some will hate it. However, if dining while opera singers perform around you sounds like your idea of a romantic evening then this is the place to come. It’s a little intense, very different and the loosely French food is far from the best around — but in all honesty, you and your guest are likely to have a great time that you’ll remember for a long time to come. belcantolondon.co.uk 2. Date with a difference \nWhile we’re chatting about Valentine’s, if you’re looking to meet someone new but aren’t into all the tweeness of most dating nights, then try the just-launched Single Cylinders. Loosely themed for motorcycle lovers, anyone hoping to head down needs to apply to attend: organisers are looking to match people with a sense of adventure. \nInfo: Feb 10, 64 Scalter Street, E1 6HT, singlecylinders.com 3. Drink the world’s best cocktails Team behind ‘World’s Best Bar’ coming to London \nThe team behind the ‘World’s Best Bar’, The Dead Rabbit Grocery and Grog in New York, are in the middle of a three day residency at the Bloomsbury Club Bar to celebrate their new bar, BlackTail. We’ve been – twice in two days, in fact, because it’s that good. Don’t miss it. \nInfo: Until Feb 11, The Bloomsbury Club Bar, WC1B 3NN, doylecollection.com 4. LGBT walk in Islington \nCelebrate LGBT history month by taking part in one of the free guided walks happening across Islington. Why Islington? Well, the area has played a surprisingly significant part in the rise of LGBT rights – including hosting the first Gay Rights demo in 1970, at Highbury Fields. \nInfo: Starts at The Islington Museum, EC1V 4NB, islingtonlife.london 5. Whoopi Goldberg's UK first \nThe legendary Whoopi Goldberg is returning to her comedic roots with one night only of stand-up at the Palladium. It’ll be the first time the Oscar, Tony, Emmy and Grammy winner has ever performed the act in the UK. \nInfo: Feb 11, Palladium, W1F 7TE, rutlive.co.uk 6.
