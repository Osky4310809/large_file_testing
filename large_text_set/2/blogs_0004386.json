The question is who’s responsible for paying for PG&E mistakes?\nState Sen. Jerry Hill, who defended San Bruno homeowners after the explosion, is now looking into whether the regulator’s relationship with the utility giant is still too close.\n“To make sure it is transparent, done right, and that there isn’t a gouging of a cost for gas,” said Hill.\nFor now, Miller will keep the heater off, and the jacket on.\n“I’ll live in a coat,” she said.\nPG&E STATEMENT ON RISING COSTS \nWe understand that higher than expected bills are frustrating. We want our customers to know that we are here to help them manage their energy costs. Approved rate changes funding gas safety and electric reliability work and seasonal changes in energy use are the major drivers of these bill increases.

PG&E provides a range of programs and tools that help customers actively manage and take control of their energy use and bills.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:52:53.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
