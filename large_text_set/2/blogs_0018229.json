Lorain , currently fourth in the cleveland.com Top 25 , obliged — and both teams left their game Tuesday night confident this meeting made them better. \nLorain just had the 84-71 victory to show for it. \n“I’m excited. Maybe not after tonight, but I’m excited,” said Duke, whose 15th-ranked Ironmen (13-8) are the third seed in the Division II Stow District and still have Friday’s regular-season finale against Youngstown Valley Christian. \nDuke knew what his team faced Tuesday on the road. \nLorain (19-2) has not lost since Jan. 17 to No. 3 St. Edward. The Titans are the top seed in the Division I Elyria Catholic District , poised to make a third straight run to regionals and have won 11 games in a row. \nYet Central Catholic walked into Lorain’s gym and began to run up and down the court with some ease. \nRELATED: Click here for district tournament takeaways and here for brackets . \nThe Ironmen scored the first seven points, built a 14-6 lead on Tyler Golphin ’s dunk and were ready to shock their hosts. The difference grew to 32-22 before Lorain closed the first half on a 13-point run, taking the lead on senior guard Daesean Brooks ’ leaner and never trailing again. \nSix players scored in double figures for the Titans, led by senior forward Naz Bohannon ’s 16. Sophomore Taevon Pierre-Louis added 15 off the bench. Brooks had 13, while senior guard Jalil Little (12 points), sophomore Devon Grant (14) and senior forward Octavius Wilson (12) all factored into the blitz. \n“We have five guys averaging double figures,” Lorain coach John Rositano said. “When we do that, we’re tough to defend.” Look in early.

Junior twins Delshawn and Dyshawn Jackson prevented their foes from finding passing lanes. Point guard Alex Heath pounced on loose balls created by his teammates. \nThe combination boiled into an up-and-down affair. \nCentral Catholic’s last basket of the first half exemplified that. Just as Delshawn Jackson broke away on a steal, Bohannon pinned his layup off the backboard. Following a battle for the rebound, Dyshawn Jackson corralled it for a 32-22 lead. Watching @Deljack21 and @NextUp440 go at it: worth price of admission. And @Dyjack4 got his brother's back. pic.twitter.com/0bJx1a1TW3 — Matt Goul (@mgoul) February 22, 2017 \nThe Jackson brothers combined for 22 points, while Golphin and senior forward Miryne Thomas each provided 15. \n“We were motivated by what they were doing,” Bohannon said. “They got to talking, went up 10 and we were like that’s not us. When you talk to us, we get fueled by that.” \nLorain’s lead grew to double digits quickly in the third quarter, and the second of two dunks from Bohannon pushed it to that point. \nCentral Catholic never recovered, but Duke did not think he will mind in the coming days. \n“For me, it’s not about wins and losses at this point,” he said. “We have to be battle-tested. That’s why we put together the schedule we put together.” \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
