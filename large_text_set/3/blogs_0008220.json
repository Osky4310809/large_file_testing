Winston is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be. Customer Reviews by Bobbarita This is one of my favorite books of all time. The tale is gripping, suspenseful, and and an emotionally stirring ride. The characters are relatable and the setting is dark and foreboding. \"1984\" is an amazing commentary on the dark path humanity might end up following, and a warning against fear and inaction in the face of tyranny. The book has one of the best endings ever, and the conclusion will both satisfy and tug your heartstrings. Lack of oversight? by ComradeSlice Did anyone actually review this iBook before it was published? Besides very trivial spelling errors, what appear to be page numbers start to creep into the text mid-way through the book. It's almost as if the publisher put little to no effort into porting the paper copy to an electronic format. I do call this a \"port\" (and a shoddy one at that) because it bears the unmistakable marks of someone shoving a paper book into a photo-copier (again, I cite the page numbers embedded in the text). A Warning by Dwardeng Orwell wrote this right after WW2 when the Cold War began. Totalitarianism comes in many forms and can disable humanism and free thought. 1984 is a concept which unfortunately rings true. One only has to study human history and current events to see that it is indeed real and all around us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T07:59:59.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
