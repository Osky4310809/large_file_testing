In an age where engagement is critical to keep your customers happy, falling behind becomes a serious problem \nTo solve these problems, Facebook's rolling out an update for Pages that changes the standard \"Messages\" tab into a redesigned \"Inbox\". This Inbox will enable brands to manage their Messenger messages, Facebook posts, and Instagram comments in one centralized hub, reducing the need to log in on different platforms to manage communications \nThe update, to be made available on desktop, will have an interface with a sidebar that will separate into 3 distinctly colored tabs for Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram respectively. Brands will be able to carry on with normal tasks such as replying to messages, interacting on posts, and replying to comments. \nNew features have been introduced into the Inbox as well - posts can be marked as \"Done\" or \"Follow Up\" and they'll automatically be sorted into separate folders of the same name. Social media managers will find this update especially helpful when dealing with multiple tasks and posts a day by keeping track of their progress. \nFacebook power users may be familiar with this update - back in November, a similar update was released for mobile devices via Facebook's Pages app. \nThere's no timeline for a full rollout as yet, but in the meantime, ensure that your Instagram account is linked to your page to receive the feature.
