Security camera footage of Justin Kuijer, 43, of St. Catharines, the suspect in a stabbing at an RBC branch in the Ontario city. Around 10:15 a.m Thursday Whitney Dumas entered her home in the southern Ontario town. She was met at the door by her ex-boyfriend Justin Kuijer, who had his bags packed and was ready to leave.\n“I said to him, well let’s go inside and talk about arrangements for our kids. We have three kids,” said Dumas, who had been in a relationship with the man for nearly six years. “He asked for my keys to my van so he could go get a coffee. That’s when I went into the house and found my son.”\nDumas found her seven-year-old son Nathan Dumas, who is Kuijer’s stepson, critically injured.\nShe called 911. About 10-minutes later Niagara Regional Police responded to calls of a stabbing at the RBC at 211 Martindale Rd.\nShortly afterwards, police began a manhunt for Kuijer, 43, of St. Catharines, for attempted murder in connection to the bank stabbing. Police say Kuijer is considered armed and dangerous and his whereabouts remain unknown.\nNathan was taken to the St. Catharines hospital in critical condition. Dumas said her son died Saturday morning.\nHe was the kindest little boy you’d ever meet. Everybody loved him… He was such an old soul\n“He was the kindest little boy you’d ever meet. Everybody loved him,” said Dumas. “He was such an old soul.”\nDumas said a friend of Nathan’s lost an eye in an accident over a year ago, and received a donated eye.\n“He had two different eye colours, so I had to explain to Nathan why that was. And he said to me, ‘Mom, that is what I want. If something ever happens to me, that’s what I want,’” Dumas said. “But we can’t do that because of the measures they took to try and save his life.”\nDumas’ apartment on Queenston St. has been sealed by police as part of their ongoing investigation.\nBob Tymczyszyn/Postmedia Network A police car sits in front of a building on Queenston St. in St. Catherines, where a side apartment door had a police seal and yellow tape around it. The boy was found seriously wounded inside. “I don’t have anything right now,” said Dumas. “I don’t have clothes for my kids. I don’t have clothes for me. My whole world has been ripped apart. I just want justice for my son and for that lady at the bank. I want him found.”\nFriends of Dumas have launched a GoFundMe campaign to help pay for Nathan’s funeral.\nPolice spokesman Const. Phil Gavin said police will not discuss how the circumstances that brought the boy to hospital and the stabbing at the bank are connected. However, late Saturday afternoon police confirmed that Nathan is the stepson of Kuijer.\nThe cause of Nathan’s death has not been released.\nThe NRP say a man entered the RBC around 10:25 a.m. Friday and stabbed a woman who works there. Police say the woman was deliberately targeted by her assailant, but are still trying to determine his motive.\nBob Tymczyszyn/Postmedia Network Niagara Regional Police are investigating after a stabbing at an RBC branch in St. Catherines on Friday.

The man left the bank and drove away in a grey 2009 Pontiac Montana van with the license plate BYTE392.\nAlong with holding scenes at the bank and the Queenston Street house, police were also at the St. Catharines hospital as a precautionary measure Friday.\nEarly Saturday morning, Dumas posted a photo of her van on Facebook, informing people her son had died and pleading for anyone with information to call police.\nShe said she doesn’t understand why anyone would hurt her son other than as a way to hurt her.\nPolice are asking anyone who knows the location of Kuijer or the van to call 911.\nKuijer is described as a white man, with a thin build, trimmed beard and longer dark hair. He was wearing a black toque, brown leather coat, dark pants, boots and an orange hoodie.\nRelated Serial sex offender walks out of Kingston correctional facility, sparking manhunt in Ontario Ontario nursing home where ex-nurse accused of murders ordered to halt admissions over safety risk ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T15:59:07.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
