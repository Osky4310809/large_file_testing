Since the IGP’s assumption of the office, he has promoted about 5,000 ASPs. \n“This is a remarkable achievement. Motivation is one of the cardinal objectives of reward systems, which in this case is promotion. The IGP has said that promotion is a continuous process. So, you must work hard to earn it.” \nAwunah emphasised that any promoted officers who flouted the law would be punished. \nHe stated that promotion could not be all merry as there were gains and pains. \nHe asked the promoted officers to see their elevation as a call to greater performance. \nOne of the promoted officers, who spoke on behalf of others, Gloria James, thanked the NPF for recognising their hard work. \nShe said they would do their best in the service of the NPF to protect lives and property. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T01:24:51.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
