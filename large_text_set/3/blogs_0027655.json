They couldn’t have afforded to loosen because of the pressure that will bring on foreign exchange market. Likewise, they couldn’t have afforded to tighten because the economy is in a recession, and we have not come out of recession. So, you cannot tighten further.” \n“I think what they did was the first thing they could have done given the current situation of things.” \nThe Director-General, West African Institute for Financial and Economic Management, Prof. Akpan Ekpo, said, ‘’It is the right decision because we are not yet out of recession; so let the fiscal side do its work. The MPC decision is perfect; that was what I expected. They need fiscal and structural policies to get us out of recession.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:52:54.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
