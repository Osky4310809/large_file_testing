He appeared on the show every year until he died in April 2012. \nBarry Adelman , a longtime producer of special, spoke to Vanity Fair about why Dick was never asked to step down from the show despite his declining health.\n“It was not an option. I think, our philosophy was always if you have a family member—a dad, a mom, an aunt, an uncle—who has had a stroke or has a disability that they never had while they were part of your family growing up and suddenly they’re stricken in some way, you don’t stop inviting them to Thanksgiving and to Christmas and to all the holidays. You still love them and you still want them to participate,” he said. “ Dick had a lot to contribute and I do think that he sent a positive message to millions of families around the world.”\nContinue to honor Dick ‘s legacy by tuning in tonight.
