(ANI) \nTata Group entered a new era today as N Chandrasekaran took over as the chief, putting behind an acrimonious boardroom battle that saw the ouster of Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons Chairman. While entering the Bombay House a few minutes back, he said “will do everything to delight people who are proud of the group”. He added “it is an honour for me to assume this responsibility” and “will work with all entities to unite the group.” Popularly known as ‘Chandra’, the 54-year-old will be the first non-Parsi chairman of the 150-year old Tata Group. \nAs the chairman of Tata Sons, Chandrasekaran has his task cut out for the 150-year old Tata Group. \nSo far he had been heading the largest software exporter TCS and is responsible for making it what it is today. Last week, Chandrasekaran had described his new assignment as “a very big job” with a large canvas, where there were “challenges and opportunities” . \nYou may also like to watch: \nAs he steps into the role of the head of the $103 billion conglomerate, many immediate pressing issues will greet him. \nOne of his major focus areas will be the European operations of Tata Steel, particularly in the UK which has become a drag to the group after the unsuccessful acquisition of Corus. \nWhile Tata Steel has already started selling assets in the UK, Chandra will have to decide how much assets are to be put on the block and how much could be turned around, especially keeping in mind the implications of Brexit. \nOne of his major focus areas will be the European operations of Tata Steel, particularly in the UK which has become a drag to the group after the unsuccessful acquisition of Corus.
