Not only were more members of his immediate family - daughter, son-in-law and daughter-in-law and therefore various grandchildren - Jewish than any previous president, his cabinet and advisers were chock-full of my coreligionists. Trump - he of the \"New York values\" and the countless hours on the Howard Stern radio show - had lived a life surrounded by and working with Jews with no problem that I had ever heard about.\nThe accusations never made sense to me. When I first read his statement on Holocaust Day, I didn't even notice that it didn't mention the Jews. Like a lot of people, I already assumed that was what was meant. Wasn't the Holocaust about the Jews, largely? (Yes, of course, there were others, but virtually every Holocaust book or movie is about the Jews with only a few exceptions. Some barely mention the Jews by name because it's a given. It's almost a example of metonymy.) I didn't even think to ask about it until some gotcha artists in the media who attack Trump for just about everything endlessly called attention to it. Maybe it was a deliberate omission on his administration's part, but I sincerely doubt it. It certainly was nothing like making the prime minister of Israel cool his heels with his staff in the lower part of the White House, which our former president did while he went upstairs to eat dinner alone with his family. That was a truly calculated act.\nAnd then there was the question by the Hasidic reporter at the press conference. Trump - who we know has a thin skin - jumped on the young man because Donald evidently thought he was once again about to be accused unfairly of anti-Semitism. I might have done the same myself. The young reporter, to his credit, clearly understood this and forgave Trump in in a post-conference interview, although the same gotcha artists in the press did not, most likely deliberately. (Speaking of which, the deliberate misunderstanding of Trump seems almost to be a disease with much of media. Sometimes it veers to the comical. If the SNL writers were genuinely sophisticated, they would show that. But they daren't.)\nAnd then there was the - unsolved at this writing - series of threatening phone calls made to Jewish Community Centers over the weekend coupled with the vandalism of a Jewish cemetery . Hillary Clinton - she of the \" Suha kiss \" - jumped on Trump for being tardy in his condemnation. But when he did make one, just a few hours later, it was direct and forthright.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/rogerlsimon/2017/02/22/whats-behind-the-accusations-that-trump-is-anti-semitic/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.jpost.com/International/As-first-lady-Hillary-was-a-prized-Jewish-keynoter-until-she-kissed-Suha-Arafat-398658"], "published": "2017-02-23T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:37:27.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
