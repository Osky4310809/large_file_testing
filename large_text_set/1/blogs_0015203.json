Getty Images 4 Alexander Buttner won the Premier League with Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013 \nBut despite never holding down a first-team place under Sir Alex Ferguson or David Moyes, the left-back says the fact he won the league – and Gerrard did not – proves he triumphed in England. Buttner told De Telegraaf: “I was on the pitch for United 30 times. Who can say that he has been a champion in England? “I can. Even Steven Gerrard did not succeed. “I’ve become a much better football player, I played in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern Munich and Arjen Robben.” \nButtner was signed by Ferguson back in 2012 on a five-year deal and was named man of the match during a 4-0 win against Wigan.
