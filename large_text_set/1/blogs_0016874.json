Top-seeded Andy Murray has the last match on the main court, playing Mischa Zverev. \nFederer was set to take on Kei Nishikori in a night match, followed by Kerber's match against CoCo Vandeweghe of the United States. \nAlso in action was U.S. Open champion Stan Wawrinka, playing Andreas Seppi in an afternoon match at Margaret Court Arena. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
