An Android version is in the works, the company said.\nImage: Ng yi Shu/Mashable\nThe helmet retails for $169.\nDing said it started out as a side project for the two, who were at Harvard as engineering students. \"We were just tinkering on the side making something we thought was cool, and we were just making it for ourselves.\n\"Only after literally hundreds of people told us they would buy one if we made it did we start considering it seriously.\"\nBut like many a Kickstarter project, product delivery had to be delayed.\nDing explained that the company did have a product ready in the timeline promised, but feedback from beta testers indicated that the company needed to work on the helmet's fit, and refining parts of its cosmetic design.\nThey also had to refine the accelerometer's sensitivity so that it wouldn't falsely trigger the brake lights.\n\"There were just a lot of small things that put together made the product look very unfinished,\" he said.\nAnd in the future, the Lumos could work in a ride tracker to add activity data to workout apps. Ding noted that aggregated ride data could even go further in helping cities and cycling communities plan better routes.\nBONUS: Ikea is now selling a bicycle — and it looks just as pretty as their furniture", "external_links": ["http://giphy.com/embed/3o6YfVlyh7gN2L7eRW?html5=true", "http://giphy.com/embed/l3q2YQRHYf2FD60og?html5=true", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oooVcsoLUci31C-2cy9dSMWjWtI=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F385705%2Fa20649c5-5f37-4e8e-a297-30329dc0500c.png", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/819484536/lumos-a-next-generation-bicycle-helmet", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wBn9JBOc0FEGmDThNWv9qYN-F0I=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F387097%2Fb0a95834-15a3-4971-a2ab-e563041daee7.jpg", "http://giphy.com/embed/3o6YgjlKmXFYkFLmzm?html5=true", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/7C9HrSIx.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SJfXWPqi_gyOyBNKJ0WIBTrFHzw=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F385705%2Fa20649c5-5f37-4e8e-a297-30329dc0500c.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/spNpkgiHouJ5lj8ZR-7bZHUw3Tk=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F387103%2F17332834-2d0b-470a-adf1-fb7d5c04b714.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Hw1NU8-vawdQQlWGbkFg-GsEVJo=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F387097%2Fb0a95834-15a3-4971-a2ab-e563041daee7.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/7C9HrSIx.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/sY1WdlCf0DWssp1dRB0VFbJWr4A=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F387103%2F17332834-2d0b-470a-adf1-fb7d5c04b714.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-17T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:12:41.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
