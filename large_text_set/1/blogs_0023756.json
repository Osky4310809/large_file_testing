In a statement given to Think Progress , Wallis noted that he and his peers \"will never accept a religious test for entry into the United States.\" \n\"As Jesus taught us in Matthew 25, our Christian faith should compel us to act  —  to advocate for welcoming refugees of all faiths into our country instead of turning them away,\" stated Wallis. \n\"Religious tests, in addition to being morally repugnant, would threaten our nation's democratic principles and the constitutional rights of every American.\" \nWorld Relief, a charity established by the National Association of Evangelicals, directed CP to a statement by World Relief President Scott Arbeiter expressing dismay at Trump's plans to curb refugee resettlement. \n\"The lengthy delay imposed in this ban further traumatizes refugees, most of whom are women and children, keeps families separated and punishes people who are themselves fleeing the terror we as a nation are rightly fighting to end,\" stated Arbeiter. \n\"Standing with us are many thousands of American citizens in congregations and communities across the nation who have joined us in this cause. We do so remembering that many of our ancestors came to this nation fleeing the persecution of their day.\" \nThe Christian Post attempted to reach out to the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, since in the past it has been critical of Trump's calls for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration. However, the ERLC could not return comment by press time.
