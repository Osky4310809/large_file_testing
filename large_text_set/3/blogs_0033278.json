This new software is the same as the developer beta that was seeded earlier this week, which means it’s a minor software update that’s meant to address any new behind-the-scenes issues that were discovered since the public release of iOS 10.3, as well as improve overall performance. \nIf you are not part of the public beta program yet, you can learn more right here . For those already signed up, and which have the necessary configuration profile on their iOS device, the new beta can be installed as an over-the-air update. \nIf anything noteworthy is discovered in the public beta, we’ll update this post accordingly.
