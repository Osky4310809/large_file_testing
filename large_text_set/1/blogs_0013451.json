What began with the odd bet on football and horseracing led to something more serious. \n\"Gambling became my be-all and end-all, he said, adding: \"It was the most important thing in my life.\" \nSpeaking anonymously to BBC Scotland, he recalled: \"I ran my own business at the time and I should have been there from eight in the morning. But I hadn't left work until six o'clock that morning. \n\"I'd go home and sleep till 12 in the day and at 12 o'clock I'd go straight to the bookmakers again and I'd be there till closing or until I lost my money. \n\"Then I'd go back to work and work through the night and the same routine constantly perpetuated itself.\" \nBob sought help after being overcome with guilt and remorse at not having the money to by his mother a birthday present, and has not gambled for some time. \nDonald Morrison, from the Association of British Bookmakers in Scotland, said the organisation would work with government and councils to make sure the regulations were applied responsibly. \nHe added: \"Betting shops open in busy commercial areas that have high footfall and strong demand and, like any sector, where's demand, there's competition.\" \nMr Morrison said that since the financial crash, bookmakers had moved into empty town centre locations, contributing business rates and creating jobs. \nHe added: \"Despite the perception that bookies have actually proliferated, the actual numbers of bookmakers in Scotland and across the UK has been in decline in recent years. \n\"In the last two years or so we've lost 300 shops across the UK, including dozens in Scotland, many of them small operators. \n\"Nevertheless we're an industry that contributes Â£110m a year to the economy.\" \nYou can see more on this story on Sunday Politics Scotland at 11:35 on BBC One Scotland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T05:14:29.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
