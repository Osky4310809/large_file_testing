Instead, current women’s bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes battered Rousey across the Octagon and left her seriously contemplating retirement. \nSo of course, some crappy people just had to add a cherry to the shit sundae by vandalizing her Venice Beach home. Rousey is no stranger to graffiti … there are at least two murals honoring the UFC superstar floating around the neighborhood. But what ends up on our own walls is never on the same level. \nRonda Rousey pictured for the first time following humiliating 48-second UFC defeat and having her home vandalized https://t.co/vbrvDbMtZ4 pic.twitter.com/YkaXLPequL \n— Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) January 10, 2017 \n\n\nRonda Rousey's Venice Home Targeted By Angry Fans, Vandalized For Nunes Defeat [Photos] https://t.co/ZOojrAWLmW pic.twitter.com/JeXegGd6Hw \n— Tarjei Nymark Mørkve (@MMA_Norway_) January 10, 2017 \n\nFor Rousey, the vandalism amounted to an illegible black scrawl on her modest little home. If you’re wondering whether this was the work of salty UFC fans, it does seem like it says ‘GSP WARRIOR’ at the bottom, although anyone still referencing Georges St. Pierre obviously isn’t in the recent know as far as mixed martial arts goes.\nFortunately for Rousey, the paint will come off. She’s also coming out of her loss with Nunes in a much better place than her previous loss to Holly Holm in November of 2015. That ended with a sharp kick to the neck that knocked Ronda unconscious and jacked up her jaw. But the referee stepped in to save Rousey before Nunes could deliver a killshot at UFC 207, potentially saving her from a concussion and further head trauma. For all we know, once Ronda is done licking her wounds she could be back in action in a few months. That’s if she’s still got the desire to fight. A pretty big if, but we can always hope.\n(via The Daily Mail, h/t Bloody Elbow) \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T18:32:18.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
