Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA video of Coventry striker Yakubu apparently doing nothing during his side's 3-1 defeat by Swindon is not all that it seems. \nThe clip went viral on social media over the weekend and showed the Nigerian hovering near the touchline as play raged around him. \nBut Yakubu had actually suffered a hamstring injury but could not be replaced as Coventry has used their three substitutes. \nHe could now be out for the rest of the season. \nYakubu pulled up shortly after laying on the pass for George Thomas to score a late consolation goal and the centre-forward was brought to a halt for the final few minutes of the match. \nBut the Sky Blues season ticket holder who posted the video said there are questions to be asked about the incident after he posted the footage online which was then shared by thousands of people. Yakubu appeared to be hanging around the touchline Read More Coventry sign former Premier League striker Yakubu \nCJ Joiner told the Coventry Telegraph : “It was originally put out to say either a player isn’t injured and not doing a lot or, worse, he is injured and the manager has kept him on.” \nHe also questioned whether the player had warmed up adequately ahead of replacing Marcus Tudgay in the 70th minute. \nAfter sharing the video on Twitter , Mr Joiner said: “This video brings up certain questions. It appears he is injured. Why did the lack of a proper warm up have a negative effect? \n“With us trailing by three and then two in stoppage time, what was the benefit of keeping him on the pitch? Wouldn't that hamper his recovery too? Yakubu is set for a long spell on the sidelines (Photo: Coventry Telegraph) \n“We had used all three subs but he was trying to avoid the ball. If he was injured there are some big issues here. \n“Whatever the reasons something isn’t right.” \nThe player, who was signed by Russell Slade on a short-term contract earlier this month, will undergo a scan today to discover the full extent of the injury which, depending on the severity of the tear, could bring a premature end to his season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T19:03:31.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
