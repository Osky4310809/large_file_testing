The running back has never won a Super Bowl before in his career and will now be on the hunt for a team that gives him a shot at a ring. \nThat is why a source close to Peterson told Karen Guregian of the Boston Herald that the running back would certainly consider taking a team-friendly deal to sign with the New England Patriots and try to win a Super Bowl. \nWant to know everything about your Super Bowl LI champion New England Patriots? Take a second to sign up for our FREE Patriots newsletter! \nPeterson has made over $97 million in his career, so even if he does only make a couple million with the Patriots it doesn't appear like it'll put him back financially at all. \nThe back signing with the Patriots would fall right in line with the Darrelle Revis , Chris Long and (if he leaves) Martellus Bennett 's of the world joining the team for a year, winning and then getting paid somewhere else after the victory parade. \nThe real question becomes about the Patriots and if they actually want Peterson. \nThere will be plenty of teams vying for his services and New England will have to pony up some dough to get him to Foxboro. \nPlus they'll have to be willing to sign him despite injury concerns and the off the field baggage he brings with the child abuse scandal of a few years ago. \nPeterson tore his meniscus in Week 2 against the Packers this season and had a mild LCL sprain which found him on injured reserve. He came back in late December, but the Vikings were all but out of contention by that point. \nIn 2015, Peterson rushed for 1,485 yards and eleven touchdowns while starting in all 16 games for Minnesota.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T19:55:56.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
