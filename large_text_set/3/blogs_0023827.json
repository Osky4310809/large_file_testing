The Argentinian spoke on Spanish radio show El Transistor (h/t AS ) and said: \" For obvious sentiments, I could never coach Madrid, and nor would they ever consider calling me. But I would coach another Spanish club.\" Simeone is in his sixth year in charge of Los Rojiblancos and made over 100 appearances for the club in two spells as a player, so it's of little surprise he would turn down an unlikely job offer from their biggest rival. Kieran Canning of the Agence France-Presse believes he'll remain at the club for the time being: Kieran Canning @KieranCanning 3/20/2017, 11:58:48 PM Indeed, according to F.J. Diaz of AS (h/t Calciomercato ), Simeone has told the powers that be at Atletico of his intention to oversee the club's transition into a new stadium this summer and remain there until his contract expires at the end of next season. The 46-year-old has had great success managing Atletico having won five trophies with the club, including the UEFA Europa League in 2012, the Copa del Rey in 2013 and La Liga in 2014. As well as seeing his side challenge Real and Barcelona's domestic dominance in Spain, Simeone has also transformed Atletico into genuine contenders on the European stage, as OptaJose illustrated: OptaJose @OptaJose 4 - Diego Pablo Simeone is the only manager to reach the #UCL quarter finals in each of the last four seasons. Master. https://t.co/S5zmxVn0BJ Atleti reached the UEFA Champions League final in 2014 and 2016, though on both occasions they lost out to Real in the final. Per Canning, it remains a source of frustration for the manager: Kieran Canning @KieranCanning Simeone: \"Milan (final) was a failure...the dictionary says a failure is not reaching ur objective. My objective was to CL & I didn't\" Nevertheless, there can be no denying the transformative effect he has had on the club, as noted by beIN Sport USA's David Cartlidge: David Cartlidge @davidjaca As Simeone's always said, identity > trophies. Changed mentality of the club. So much history in his time with Atleti. 3/15/2017, 9:43:25 PM Simeone also revealed to El Transistor (h/t AS ): \" At some point I would really like to coach Argentina but first I have to improve and become a better coach.\" He enjoyed a successful international career as a player having made over 100 caps for La Albiceleste over a 14-year period, in which he won two Copa America titles. Simeone has already demonstrated himself to be an exceptional coach, though it appears he will not be ready to take the national job upon leaving Atletico and will likely pursue another club position first. When he does, there will most likely be a scramble for his signature among a number of Europe's elite, with the natural exception of Real.
