Also referenced in tonight’s episode was Starhaven, the planet where Winn’s latest alien girlfriend is from. But what is Starhaven — or better yet, why does it hint that we may see more members of the Legion of Super-Heroes as this season of Supergirl continues to progress? \nStarhaven made its debut in Superboy #226 (1977) as the home planet of both Legion of Super-Heroes member Dawnstar and R.E.B.E.L.S. member Wildstar. Located near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, Starhaven is a planet with little industry as the residents prefer to live in a culture much like that of a traditional Native American culture. The residents of Starhaven worship the Great Spirit, an entity that they believe creates order in the universe. \nMuch like Dawnstar, the native inhabitants of Starhaven each have a pair of feathered wings that allow them to fly at supersonic speeds, faster than the speed of sounds. \nIn addition to tonight’s mention of Starhaven, the alien planet has been mentioned on Supergirl before. In the 14th episode from last season, Kara mentions to a prisoner that she remembers visiting the planet with her dad as a child, even recalling that the air had smelled of cinnamon. \nSupergirl airs Monday nights at 8 p.m. ET/PT on The CW.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:53:47.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
