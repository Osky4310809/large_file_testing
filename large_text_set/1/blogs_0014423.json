(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLetter to the editor: \nPresident Obama commuted Chelsea Manning’s sentence on Tuesday. \nI’m having a problem with liberals, Democrats and Obama being concerned about potential hacking by Russia, when we now know that a person who disclosed classified documents gets her sentence commuted. \nIt says a lot about the fake outrage over a potential hacking, when our president commutes a soldier’s treasonous activity. \nBarry Levy; Hawthorne, Calif. \nFacebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar: \nShocker. President Obama commuting the sentencing of Chelsea Manning, who released classified information. I just thank God that Obama only has a couple more days. \n— Jackie Gibbs \nMaybe 35 years was too steep of a sentence, but I would not have commuted this sentence to only time served. Had it been up to me, she would have had to serve at least 10 years for her crime. It sends the wrong message. There was information that could have endangered lives in the documents she gave to WikiLeaks. \n— Bradford Talamon \nYou’ve got to love the hypocrisy of Obama and Democrats. They cry over Russia releasing confidential emails, but the person who released information to WikiLeaks gets her sentence commuted. But what else do you expect from the president and the Democrats in general? Obama threw the left a bone. Ideology overrules reality with Democrats. \n— Paul Rush", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T04:57:46.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
