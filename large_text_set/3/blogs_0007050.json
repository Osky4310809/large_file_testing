Somebody else has to want to do it and make it happen, but I certainly try to let the involved parties know, ‘If anybody’s interested, hi!’ I would absolutely do it.”\nTerri has also recently worked on an episode of Hilary ‘s TV Land comedy Younger . “[ Hilary ] still looks like Lizzie McGuire to me in this role,” Terri added. “The fact that she is this cool, fashionable, intelligent executive, it all makes sense to me, and the only thing missing is the little animated character telling us what’s really going on inside her head.”\nWe definitely hopes this reboot happens!\nPictured: Hilary taking her four-year-old son Luca (not pictured) to the movies and out shopping at Urban Outfitters on Friday (March 10) in Studio City, Calif. Hilary was also spotted shopping at Sweaty Betty on Wednesday (March 8) in New York City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T04:50:16.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
