John Thune (R-S.D.), left rear, and Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) — walks up to reporters following a closed-door strategy session Tuesday on Capitol Hill. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) By Kelsey Snell and Ed O'Keefe By Kelsey Snell and Ed O'Keefe March 28 at 4:55 PM Follow @kelsey_snell Follow @edatpost \nSenate Republicans were at odds with President Trump on Tuesday over a White House request to cut more than $18 billion in spending on programs such as education and medical research to help fund $30 billion in new defense spending and construction of a border wall with Mexico. \nSeveral top Republicans rejected the cuts, which were detailed in a memo from White House budget director Mick Mulvaney that was obtained by The Washington Post and verified by White House and congressional officials. The disagreement comes as Republicans and Democrats are working to finalize negotiations on a spending bill to fund the government past April 28 and avoid a government shutdown within the first several months of Trump’s presidency. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) and other senators avoided making any direct commitment on whether the border wall would be included in the upcoming spending bill. \n“Democrats and Republicans . . . are working together on this, and we fully anticipate getting an outcome prior to the end of April,” McConnell said. \nIn addition, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told reporters Tuesday that he expects that there will be a bipartisan spending bill and that a vote to fund the wall would happen in a separate supplemental bill sometime later this year. \n“I would suspect the border wall is in the supplemental,” Blunt said. \nBut several top GOP senators openly dismissed Trump’s calls for cuts on Tuesday and generally avoided any talk of funding the border wall in the upcoming spending bill. Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) was one of a half-dozen Republicans engaged in spending negotiations to say in interviews Tuesday that Trump’s requests were not likely to be fulfilled. \n“Congress will decide what they want and what they don’t want,” Shelby said. “I don’t think we need a shutdown argument, period. I don’t know any rational person who wants a shutdown.” [ Trump’s path forward only gets tougher after health-care fiasco ] \nRepublicans maintain a slim 52-to-48 advantage in the Senate, and they cannot risk alienating Democrats if they hope to muster the 60 votes necessary to pass a stopgap spending bill before the April 28 deadline. \n“We’re still in the same spot where we need 60 votes in the Senate to be able to accomplish that,” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) \nThat means Republicans must ignore Trump’s demands if they hope to avoid a shutdown fight. Democrats have said they are willing to block a spending bill if Republicans include funding for a border wall or any attempt to follow through on Trump’s plan for a massive deportation force. \n“They are asking for something that is going to be deeply damaging,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wa.) “We’re going to fight back with everything we have.” [ Senate Democrats prepare for spring battle over border wall ] \nRepublicans in Congress had generally hoped to avoid any serious conflict over the must-pass spending bill in April and leave the bigger budget battles for later this year. GOP Senate leaders planned to claim a quick policy victory this spring by speeding through votes on a spending bill quickly after confirming Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. \nPushing to fulfill Trump’s request for the border wall paired with deep cuts to popular programs would almost certainly derail those plans. Even those who support Trump’s proposed defense spending increases weren’t interested in forcing a shutdown fight to get it. \n“Ultimately I’m not sure that’s the direction the Appropriations Committee is going to move,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said. “In the end, the Congress is responsible for spending the money. \nMost Republicans played down the conflict with Trump as a normal part of a negotiation between over spending priorities. It is common for White House budget officials to send Congress a list of proposed cuts to offset any new spending priorities, but rarely do the cuts target popular programs like medical research at the National Institutes of Health in exchange. \nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) told reporters Tuesday that Congress had just voted the previous year to increase funding for NIH and other research. Cornyn said the difference of priorities was to be expected but gave no suggestion that Trump’s spending requests would be entertained. \n“I think they’re becoming very aware of how hard the legislative process is,” Cornyn said. “I look at it as a conversation.” \nBecause of a transcription error, an earlier version mistakenly attributed a quote by Sen.
