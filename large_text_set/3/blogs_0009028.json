The refreshed D-segment model, which is still in its seventh generation, should make its way to other markets following its domestic market launch. \nBuyers there will get four engines to choose from – a 1.7 litre VGT diesel (141 PS/340 Nm), a 1.6 litre Gamma T-GDI petrol (180 PS/265 Nm), a 2.0 litre Nu petrol (163 PS/196 Nm) and a range-topping 2.0 litre Theta T-GDI petrol with 245 PS/353 Nm. A seven-speed DCT is paired with engines that are below 2.0L in capacity, while the 2.0L NA and 2.0 turbo units get a six-speed auto and eight-speed auto, respectively. \nAs we were shown earlier, the Sonata adopts a sharper and more aggressive styling inspired by the new i30. At the front, a smaller but more angular Cascading Grille makes way for the sleeker headlights, while the fog lamp enclosures contain the vertical LED DRLs. The 2.0 Turbo model will get a diamond mesh pattern for the grille, a different DRL setup and plenty of black accents. \nNot a whole lot of changes down the vehicle’s flanks, aside from the redesigned 17- and 18-inch wheels, which are variant dependant. For the rear, Hyundai introduced new two-piece taillights and a cleaner-looking boot, which pushes the number plate holder further south. The reflectors get reshaped to fit this new arrangement too. \nInside, the Sonata retains its familiar dashboard layout, albeit with updates to various areas like the air-conditioning and infotainment switchgear. The latter is now linked to a 7-inch colour touchscreen that now comes as standard on all variants of the Sonata, with the option of a larger 8-inch unit. \nA new three-spoke steering wheel are also featured here, with the 2.0 Turbo receiving a flat-bottomed version, together with sportier front seats. Other revisions include a new gear knob, USB charging port in the centre console, wireless smartphone charging capability (first time), plus Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. \nFor safety, the sedan comes with a suite of driver assistance technologies like Lane Departure Warning, Blind Spot Detection, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, High Beam Assist, Dynamic Bending Lights, and a Lane Keep Assist function.
