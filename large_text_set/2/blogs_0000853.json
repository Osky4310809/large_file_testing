This was not the warm-hearted, part-zombified, part-obligatory standing ovation of Broadway. Each muscle of her body was engaged. Her legs, her thighs, her upper body, neck, head were all applauding, her arms pounding. She had a message to convey to the actors. What she was saying was: “Thank you.” \nFor what? I believe it needed no decoding. Some deep, unsayable truth had been uttered – and received. \nHedda Gabler is a difficult play, as are most of Ibsen’s dramas. We produced A Doll’s House at the Young Vic a few years ago. The year before, we did a play by Jon Fosse . Fosse, the second-most-performed Norwegian playwright, came to lunch, so I asked him: what does A Doll’s House mean? \nHe replied: “The Germans understand Ibsen, the French, the Dutch. Only you English get him wrong. You think he’s some kind of progressive, an artistic social worker. No. Ibsen is the poet of destruction.” \nSo what’s Hedda Gabler about? The way women are oppressed by patriarchy, yes, maybe, but the other female lead in the play escapes. Why can’t Hedda? It’s about her depression. But a play just about a chemical imbalance would never have caught the world’s imagination.

It’s about the contradictions – irresolvable, murderous – involved in being alive in that skin. \nRuth Wilson’s performance explains nothing. She plays the contradictions. It’s entirely grown up, entirely generous in its willingness to evoke a total, unresolved image. The woman who leapt to her feet saw the fullness of her own life on stage and thundered: “Yes, I do exist, yes my life is just as irresolvable, just as contradictory.” \nOr that’s what, in that instant, her action seemed to me to mean. And by then, anyway, half the house were also on their feet applauding rapturously, deeply committed. Billie Piper in Yerma, directed by Simon Stone, at the Young Vic, London. Photograph: Johan Persson \nAnd this was one of those crazy European-style shows which, I read, are “ infecting ” (unlovely word) our theatres. And they’re also unpopular, I read. \nOn Wednesday, our revival of another “European” production, Simon Stone’s version of Lorca’s Yerma, went on public sale. The entire run was sold out by mid afternoon. Our A View from the Bridge, A Streetcar Named Desire, Measure for Measure – plus plus plus plus – have all had queues along the street. \nWhen I was asked to respond to David Hare’s comments about “over-aestheticised European” productions that “camp up classic plays”, I thought: “Surely, just at this moment, there are more important things.” \nBut in dark times we need each to do what we can from the centre of our individual strength, skill, understanding and experience. Theatre-makers – playwrights, actors, directors and the rest – need to tell the hard, dark, contradictory truths as we see them, as generously and in as grown-up a manner as we can manage, offering sustenance each to each.
