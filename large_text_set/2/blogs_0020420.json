My name is Shirley Ju, and I live, breathe, sleep Hip Hop. Coming from the Bay, I grew up to the hyphy movement. That being said, turning up is all I know. This will be a weekly recap of the dope events that I myself felt like I couldn‚Äôt miss, and you guys wish you were at. Thursday, February 16 \n‚Äî Shirley Ju (@shirju) February 16, 2017 \nSo, before you judge me, I have to say, I‚Äôm pretty well aware of the type of music RiFF RAFF creates. I remember last year, he came through DX offices dressed in a swagged out peach suit, with two Peach Panther ladies on either side. I wasn‚Äôt there, but it was so memorable, I felt like I was lmao. I honestly love the dude, for all that he is. His personality, his bangers, his whole persona really. \n‚Äî HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) February 17, 2017 \nShout out to Ponce De‚ÄôLeioun , who assisted in connecting me with Jody‚Äôs DJ, DJ Afterthought . Ponce was on the bill, but I guess last minute they made some changes. Smh, I always feel bad when artists do that. I pull up to The Regent in downtown L.A. to find this show to be 18 and up. Interesting. I feel like the show definitely could have been way more poppin‚Äô if the minors were allowed to come. I can hit the mall and ball like @CP3 üèÄüèÄüèÄ @JODYHiGHROLLER pic.twitter.com/4HT0YZMV5u \n‚Äî HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) February 17, 2017 \nI was dying because Afterthought had put the tickets under ‚ÄúJuJu.‚Äù We had some trouble finding them under ‚ÄúShirley Ju‚Äù lmao. After over an hour of random openers hopping on and off stage, JODY HiGHROLLER graces the stage in his red husky bomber, equipped with a fur collar. My homeboy joked it was real husky fur. . . who knows. \nIt‚Äôs retailed for $11K if anyone is interested. The crowd tonight was 99% males. It was a trip lmao. He definitely has a loyal fanbase. People were screaming ‚ÄúJody! Jody! Jody!‚Äù all night. He came out to ‚Äú Back From The Dead ‚Äù featuring Skepta, which I thought was a pretty solid starter. ‚ÄúHow To Be A Man‚Äù and ‚ÄúDolce Gabbana‚Äù are some of my favorites. I‚Äôve never seen him live, so I was juiced. . @JODYHiGHROLLER feeling the trap music tough lmao pic.twitter.com/nXyn4DAXMZ \n‚Äî Shirley Ju (@shirju) February 17, 2017 \nThe takeaway for the evening: RiFF RAFF loves trap music. Straight up. The show went from Hip Hop to trap to almost EDM, then back to trap lmao. The best part was that he was feeling it so hard. It was a party up in The Regent tonight. The neon lights were way too fitting. A post shared by HipHopDX (@hiphopdx) on Feb 17, 2017 at 12:26am PST \nI waited all night for this track lmao. ‚ÄúTiP TOE WiNG iN MY JAWWDiNZ‚Äù slaps. If you guys are fans, you‚Äôd know RiFF RAFF went on this health binge and got yoked. He got stuck taking off his husky jacket lmao his homies had to help him. Two seconds later, the jacket is on the back of his little brother on stage. Cute lmao. In between sets, he takes a moment to announces the names of his new weed strains, one self-titled JODY HiGHROLLER. A post shared by RiFF RaFF JODY HiGHROLLER (@jodyhighroller) on Feb 16, 2017 at 12:19pm PST \nMy homeboy showed up with a bottom grill. I was so proud. Later in the show, Jody and his squad out of nowhere decides to throw water all over us. I hate that shit lmao. Can we start a petition for artists to stop doing that? Please. By the way, if you want to be like RiFF RAFF, just type all caps and lowercase your i‚Äôs. You‚Äôre halfway there. Friday, February 17 \n‚Äî Shirley Ju (@shirju) February 18, 2017 \nTonight was one for the books. This was a show I will never forget. Not only were these feelings heightened during the show, but prior to the show also. I‚Äôve never been more excited. The Dream at the lovely El Rey on his Love You To Death Tour. A post shared by HipHopDX (@hiphopdx) on Feb 17, 2017 at 8:57pm PST \nBefore we get into all that, shout out to James Supreme for assisting the interview with 24Hrs. I‚Äôve been trying to grab the former Royce Rizzy ever since his show at The Roxy. I saw last minute that he was opening for The-Dream, and thought that was amazing. A rising R&B star opening for an R&B GOAT. Here for it. \n‚Äî HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) February 18, 2017 \nI step into the room backstage to find Twenty chilling in the barber chair, getting his fade cut. That was my only opportunity to speak with him, and was so happy to hear he was willing. Some artists make it impossible for you to do your job. I like to always keep it personal. Building a relationship with these artists is something I really treasure. Shout out to Madeintyo by Twenty‚Äôs side the entire evening. I love my brother too lmao. A post shared by HipHopDX (@hiphopdx) on Feb 17, 2017 at 9:39pm PST \nI was stoked, again, to see Ty Dolla $ign come out to support. ‚ÄúWhat You Like‚Äù is a certified banger. And ‚ÄúBlas√©‚Äù will never get old. I waited for my homegirl to roll up, and decided to get some work down in the VIP balcony. I watched the El Rey fill up to the point I had to take my rain jacket off. It was a sauna. \n‚Äî HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) February 18, 2017 \nThe-Dream came out singing ‚ÄúBed,‚Äù his cover of the original track by J. Holiday. It‚Äôs crazy because this was actually Kanye‚Äôs song of choice at his Yeezy Season 5 fashion show in New York. On repeat too. You know Ye planned that shit, like he plans all of his moves. And then The Dream played ‚Äú Rockin‚Äô That Shit,‚Äù and I went straight into nostalgia. bed, falsetto, rockin that shit, fancy, this @TheKingDream show is all i ever wanted. \n‚Äî Shirley Ju (@shirju) February 18, 2017 \nThis took me right back to high school. I pulled my girl to the way front, to the right side of the stage. My secret spot. I wanted to be as close as possible, without suffocating. ‚ÄúFancy, ‚ÄúRight Side of My Brain,‚Äù ‚ÄúSeat It Out,‚Äù the list goes on. The-Dream was looking smooth as ever in his Givenchy shirt. The crowd started screaming after they recognized what song he was about to bless them with. \"I don't make album fillers\"‚Äì @TheKingDream \n‚Äî HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) February 18, 2017 \nThis tour was in light of Dream‚Äôs most recent EP, home to his single ‚ÄúLemon Lean.‚Äù The crowd was reciting all the lyrics. I loved the pictures of lemons that came up on the screen behind him. It definitely reminded us of Queen Bey. Don‚Äôt quote me, but The-Dream might be as lit as Beyonce. His music speaks volumes. . @TheKingDream covering Jay Z's \"Holy Grail\" üíé pic.twitter.com/wqdbrU8y5h \n‚Äî HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) February 18, 2017 \nCovering Jay Z‚Äôs ‚ÄúHoly Grail‚Äù literally had me in my feelings. What a beautiful track, covered by a beautiful voice. The-Dream could probably sing any song handed to him. His voice tonight was literally spot on. Not only is he amazing live, but he‚Äôs entertaining as well. He shouted out his daughter in attendance on VIP balcony, telling her to put on earmuffs before he performed ‚ÄúPut It Down.‚Äù The-Dream is so lit, he probably makes love to his music. A post shared by HipHopDX (@hiphopdx) on Feb 17, 2017 at 11:19pm PST \n‚ÄúPurple Kisses‚Äù is another track of gold. ‚ÄúIV Play‚Äù had El Rey getting freaky. The-Dream disappeared mid-show for a couple minutes and comes back out in a brand new outfit. Some blazer swag. He proceeded to play ‚ÄúMy Love,‚Äù ‚ÄúI Luv Ya Girl‚Äù and ‚ÄúShawty Is A Ten.‚Äù I teared up. Such good times bumping The-Dream back home in the bay. A post shared by HipHopDX (@hiphopdx) on Feb 17, 2017 at 11:45pm PST \nHe let everyone know he‚Äôs been doing this music thing for ten years now. Respect. He ended by singing Rihanna‚Äôs ‚ÄúUmbrella,‚Äù which he helped write. His encore: ‚ÄúWalkin‚Äô On the Moon‚Äù featuring Ye. What a perfect (happy) ending. Saturday, February 18 \n‚Äî Shirley Ju (@shirju) February 18, 2017 \nThe day has finally come: Soulquarius , the R&B festival of the century. Literally, this lineup was everything you ever wanted, and then some. I saw Pretty Ricky on the lineup and had a moment. This was pure nostalgia (that seems to be the theme for the weekend). Hello, OC Observatory . Last time I was here was to see Gucci Mane‚Äôs (short) set at Beach Goth . Worth it. A post shared by OBSERVATORY OC (@observatoryoc) on Feb 18, 2017 at 11:47am PST \nBefore we get to the actual festivities, I have to share with you all my fail of the day, maybe of the week. So, the other night, my brother had told me the 101 South ramp was closed leaving Hollywood, so I switched my Google maps to the ‚Äúavoid highways‚Äù option. No joke, the entire day I was wondering why it kept saying the trip from L.A. to OC would be two hours. I figured, there was supposed to be a storm. So that means traffic. SMH. \nI pull up and my homegirl (shout out to her) was wondering the same thing. Why‚Äôd it take so long? At that moment, I realized I had forgotten to switch the route options back to normal. I legit took the back roads all the way to Santa Ana, and it took two fucking hours. When I didn‚Äôt even want to drive an hour in the first place. Hi, I‚Äôm an idiot. \nThat being said, I missed a lot of the earlier sets. We pull up to one of the most popping venues in SoCal around 6:30 p.m., luckily, with a clear sky. It actually started sprinkling on our way out (during R. Kelly‚Äôs set). Thank you rain gods for blessing us. There were four stages, half indoor, half outdoor. This festival was completely sold out, which was evident the moment you entered. Literally, so. many. people. I‚Äôve never felt so grateful having a media pass, shout out to Owen. He‚Äôs the best. hey #soulquarius it would be so dope if the artists were on time for their sets \n‚Äî Shirley Ju (@shirju) February 19, 2017 \nAfter waiting for DMX for a good 15 minutes, we realized, these set times were not accurate. Artists were over 30 minutes behind. Speaking with the ambitious festival-goers who came early af when doors were supposed to open, I find out most were miserable. They had to wait two plus hours to get inside the venue, standing in the rain. That would definitely have pissed me off as well. But hey, cut them some slack. This was the first year they were doing this, so I‚Äôm sure it was a lot of trial and error. A post shared by HipHopDX (@hiphopdx) on Feb 18, 2017 at 10:19pm PST \nNo one knew where anything was, but we managed to push our way to the front of the main stage outdoors for Ja Rule and Ashanti. I saw them twice on their last tour- their hits will always be fire. They were a crowd favorite for sure. Ashanti comes out looking like bae, and Ja Rule‚Äôs voice screaming ‚ÄúMurdaaaa‚Äù is one that will never be forgotten. Lloyd popping out for ‚ÄúSouthside‚Äù was epic. That song gave me hope in love (in high school). \n‚Äî HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) February 19, 2017 \nI had to run back inside to catch the main attraction: Pretty Ricky . If you don‚Äôt know who they are, then we have nothing in common. Jk. But really, I grew up to these four R&B superstars (of their time). My girl goes, ‚ÄúWhich one is he?‚Äù Stop. I died. The photo pit had us real up close and personal, as the R&B boy band humped the air. ‚ÄúPlayhouse‚Äù was my jam, along with ‚ÄúOn The Hotline.‚Äù \nSmh. They cut off their mics after 15 minutes. The crowd (mostly the ladies) was very upset. I was too. They didn‚Äôt even play ‚ÄúGrind With Me.‚Äù One of the members grabbed the roses they were probably going to hand a special lady, and threw that shit high in the air into the crowd. Another member threw the microphone down on stage with anger. Another member had on a Bad And Boujee shirt. #CULTURE. \n‚Äî HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) February 19, 2017 \nHad to catch some of Mya before we mobbed back to the main stage to see the queen, Erykah Badu. She was the favorite on the bill. Many came out just to see her. I did the same exact thing at Tyler, The Creator‚Äôs Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival , so I totally understood. \n‚Äî HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) February 19, 2017 \nI could not get over her outfit. Like, it was a completely distorted puffy outerwear coat, that somehow sit perfectly on her body. She also had on some kind of chin jewelry. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was pure gold. I was in the photo pit, and could not help but stare at the mayhem that ensued when Monica walked through. I texted my boss that people were acting like I would if Chris Brown walked through. Complete fangirl phenomena. He responded that Monica was his first girl crush. Lmao. \nWe were making moves. We mobbed back inside to see Baby Bash . Productivity is a way of life. We made it in perfect time to hear his hits: ‚ÄúSuga Suga‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Back‚Äù featuring Akon. Bringing out Frankie J for ‚ÄúObsession‚Äù was the cherry on top.
