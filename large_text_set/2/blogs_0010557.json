Meanwhile, Phinma Energy has an equity participation of 25 percent. \nApart from the Mabini project, Basic Energy has four other geothermal service contracts, namely the East Mankayan Geothermal Prospect in Ifugao, Mt. Mariveles Geothermal Project in Bataan, Mt. Iriga Geothermal Project in Albay and West Bulusan Geothermal Prospect in Sorsogon.
