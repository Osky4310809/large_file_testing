West has eschewed past venues like Madison Square Garden and Roosevelt Island in favor of the more traditional Pier 59 at Chelsea Piers. The show is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. \nLast year’s Yeezy Season 4 show, which was live streamed via Tidal from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island, came under fire for delays and difficulties, which included one model fainting from standing in the heat. While Kanye did not debut new music during the Yeezy Season 4 show, he’s used his past fashion events as a platform to share songs he’s been working on. “Wolves” was first played at the Yeezy Season 1 launch in February 2015, and “Fade” was played at Yeezy Season 2 later in the year. Yeezy Season 3 , of course, was the premiere of The Life of Pablo .
