To commemorate his dedication and long-time leadership in BC’s search and rescue community, a peak in the North Shore Mountains is being named in his memory. 8 Likes ● 0 Comments ● 4 Shares Share \nA peak in the North Shore Mountains is being named in honour of a long-time leader of British Columbia’s search and rescue community and commemorates his work as an advocate for backcountry safety. \nTim Jones Peak is located on Mount Seymour in the North Shore Mountains and previously was known locally as Second Pump Peak, although that name was never officially adopted. The 1,425-metre peak is within the boundaries of Mount Seymour Provincial Park. \nTim Jones (1956-2014) was an advanced life support paramedic and unit chief with the BC Ambulance Service, as well as a team leader with the North Shore Rescue organization for many years. He was born in Edmonton. His family moved to North Vancouver when he was six years old. He spent the rest of his childhood exploring the local mountains. \nJones was a devoted husband to his wife Lindsay and a caring father who shared his love of the mountains with his children, Curtis and Taylor. He instilled the importance of volunteerism in his children from a young age. He was proud when his son became a North Shore Rescue teammate and he fundraised for the organization with his daughter at his side. \nJones died in January 2014 at the age of 57 years while hiking on Mount Seymour with his daughter and his beloved husky. \nJones was widely respected for the many significant contributions he made to the volunteer component of search and rescue activities and to outdoor safety projects and programs in British Columbia. Through his volunteer work, he helped protect the lives of over 1,600 people in his decades of service to the people of the province — not including the lives he saved as an advanced life support paramedic with the BC Ambulance Service. \nJones was instrumental in helping North Shore Rescue become the first search and rescue team in British Columbia to implement helicopter longline rescue techniques. His leadership and commitment helped North Shore Rescue to become a world-renowned search and rescue organization as he developed a state-of-the-art communications system, managed the building of its world-class rescue facilities and organized professional training for his team so they could perform rescue operations at the highest level. \nJones was a strong advocate for search and rescue volunteers throughout British Columbia, lobbying for funding and the recognition of volunteers. In 2014, the federal government recognized Jones in its budget by establishing a national search and rescue tax credit in his name. \nIn recognition of his pioneering work in backcountry safety and the many lives that he saved, Jones was presented with the Order of British Columbia, a Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Medal and an honorary doctorate from Capilano University. \nWith Avalanche Awareness Days events scheduled this weekend (Jan. 21-22, 2017), this is a fitting time to acknowledge the many contributions and sacrifices that search and rescue volunteers make throughout the year in British Columbia and elsewhere. More information about Avalanche Awareness Days is available online: www.avalanche.ca/events/avalanche-awareness-days-2017 \nQuotes: \nChristy Clark, Premier of British Columbia – \n“A hero is someone who runs toward danger when everyone else runs away. Countless times, Tim Jones headed out into the dark and the cold to help people in B.C.’s rugged backcountry. Moms, dads, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters are alive today because of Tim’s selflessness and dedication.” \nSteve Thomson, Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations – \n“The naming of Tim Jones Peak is a well-deserved recognition of Tim’s numerous contributions to British Columbia’s search and rescue community. It also honours the many volunteers who worked alongside him over the years and who continue to share his values, work ethic and dedication to public service.” \nTaylor Jones, daughter of Tim Jones – \n“We are incredibly touched to have the Province honour our father's volunteerism in this way. We will be forever grateful to have a mountain peak named after him as a symbol of his dedication, commitment and passion for helping the people of British Columbia. We will hike to this peak frequently and be reminded of how lucky we were to spend part of our lives with such a caring, compassionate and adventurous father.” \nJane Thornthwaite, MLA for North Vancouver-Seymour – \n“Tim Jones was a friend of mine and, like everyone who knew him, I miss him every day. I am so pleased that we are able to celebrate his life’s work today by renaming the second peak of Mount Seymour in his name. Tim Jones’ legacy on the North Shore and in British Columbia is legendary and I am proud to stand with his family and give him this honour.” \nGilles Valade, executive director, Avalanche Canada – \n“Avalanche Canada is our national public avalanche safety organization and everyone associated with it is proud to see Tim Jones’s leadership and accomplishments honoured. Tim was dedicated to public service and to safeguarding the lives of people venturing into the mountains that he knew so well.” \nQuick Facts: Tim Jones Peak is located on Mount Seymour, about nine kilometres northeast of North Vancouver and about four kilometres west of Indian Arm.
