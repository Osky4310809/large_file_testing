Developers launch 192-home subdivision in Wildwood Image courtesy of city of Wildwood \nA 192-home subdivision along Manchester Road in Wildwood should start in March 2017. \nConsort Homes and Fischer & Frichtel have started a 192-home subdivision in Wildwood. \nThe builders recently bought 66 acres from the family of Bill Jones Sr. along Manchester Road just east of Route 109 and across the road from the Wildwood Town Center development. A purchase price wasn’t disclosed. \n“The population continues to grow in the West County corridor, making land like this with access to major roadways a valuable asset,” Mark McNulty, a vice president at commercial real estate firm CBRE Group who represented the Jones family, said in a statement. “The time was right to capitalize on this prime location.” \nConsort Homes and Fischer Frichtel plan to begin pre-selling home lots by late summer at the new subdivision, called the Villages at Bright Leaf. Grading work on the 80-acre site should start this month, and the city has approved the plan. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher \nAbout 38 of the new home sites will be laid it out in the so-called “neo-traditional” style with alleys between back yards, similar to older city homes. \nThe planned subdivision comes as other developers move forward with large undeveloped tracts in the region. McBride & Son Homes last month announced a 223-home subdivision planned in Chesterfield , and NT Home Builders recently won approval for 850 more houses to be built in the New Town development in St. Charles County over the next several years. \nThere were 828 single family home permits issued in St. Louis County last year, compared to 870 the prior year and 698 in 2014, according to the Home Builders Association of St. Louis and Eastern Missouri. In St. Charles County, there were 1,986 single family permits issued during 2016, compared to 1,901 in 2015 and 1,935 the prior year.
