(Photo: Google) \nThe company's new \"doodle\" celebrates the birthday of Fred Korematsu , born on January 30, 1919. \nIn 1942, Korematsu was arrested for refusing to go to internment camps, according to a biography on the website of the Fred T. Korematsu Institute. He took his case all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the government, claiming his incarceration was necessary. \nKorematsu's conviction was overturned in 1983 after new evidence confirmed the government hid documents during the war proving there was no need to imprison Japanese Americans in camps. \nKorematsu died in 2005 at the age of 86. \nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .
