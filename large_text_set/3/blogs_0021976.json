Photos \nRyan Reynolds's Hottest Looks: Daytime, Nighttime, Anytime! \nThe dynamic duo also discussed which super powers they'd have if they could, and Colbert's answer seemed oddly familiar. \"Oh, I'd like to have this super cool, alien high-tech ring, and it's green and it has a lantern on it and I can use my imagination to make anything out of green light,\" Colbert explained. \nYes, he wanted to be The Green Lantern, Reynolds' former role. \n\"Wow,\" Reynolds responded. \"That's a really dumb super power.\" \nOuch! \nReynolds, on the other hand, wanted a more simple power. \"I'd like to be able to pee in a public urinal when someone's standing directly behind me,\" Reynolds shared. \n\"Oh, courage bladder,\" Colbert said. \nEven though Reynolds joked earlier that he'd still be alive, he revealed where he'd be going in the afterlife. \"I don't know about you, but I'm going to Canadian Heaven,\" he joked, adding an explanation of how it differs from American Heaven. \n\"Canadian Heaven is real. American Heaven is inside the body of Toby Keith .\" \nWatch the deep video above to see what other philosophical topics Reynolds and Colbert discuss.
