When women are able to plan their pregnancies around their goals for themselves and their families, they are also better able to finish their education, earn an income and fully participate in their communities,” she writes. \nThough the partnership would need to increase their productivity over the last three years by nearly 33% per year to hit their goal of 120 million, or 32 million women per year, Melinda is not deterred. \n“In 2012, we made a promise to women around the world,” she explains. “Our actions over the next three years will decide whether we keep it.” \nHere’s to hoping they’re able to do just that. \nWhat do you think of Melinda’s lofty heath care goals?
