Naturally, she came prepared with a moving statement. Read the full text of what she said below. \nThank you to the Grammy voters for this incredible honor and thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep Southern culture. I thank God for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter, my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. \nW e all experience pain and loss and often we become inaudible. M y intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that will give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history—to confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It ‘s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror—first through their own families, as well as the news, the Super B owl, the Olympics, the White H ouse, and the Grammys, and see themselves, and have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent, and capable. T his is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel it’s vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. T hank you, again, for honoring Lemonade. H ave a beautiful evening. “We all experience pain and loss.” Watch @beyonce ’s #Grammys acceptance speech pic.twitter.com/Sw7K9nkQgz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:40:37.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
