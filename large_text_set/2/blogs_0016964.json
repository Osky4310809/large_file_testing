Last year, the sorcerer supreme magicked his way into the MCU thanks to Scott Derrickson , and the film became one of 2016’s most profitable. Audiences could not get enough of the hero’s origin tale, and a second film is said to be coming down the line. As such, fans are already wondering if Derrickson will return to helm the sequel, and one of the franchise’s stars is saying who he thinks should take on the film. \nSpoiler: It’s Derrickson. \nRecently, Benedict Cumberbatch sat down with CinemaBlend to talk over Doctor Strange , and it was there the star pitched Derrickson to helm Doctor Strange 2 . \n“...I think also Scott's got, he's very good on process, and he's very good on visuals and he had to cram a lot in. I mean this was a much harder shoot in many ways than I imagine some of the other origin stories had been. They're all hard, not to detract from the hard work that they put in, but my point is that there was a massively fast turn around. So he was having to edit and approve special effects shots at the same time as setting up these huge sequences live and getting the camera and angles and performances and visuals right on the day.” \nContinuing, Cumberbatch said, “He was double tasking in a pretty full on way and then he was, for someone who's done stuff to do stuff with the supernatural before but never, as he'd be the first to admit I'm sure, never quite on this scale. He had to do it all with great skill and the results are on the screen. So yeah I think this film speaks to why Scott would be a great choice to direct it again.” \nOf course, there are few reasons to believe Derrickson would not return for another film. The vetted director was able to bring Doctor Strange to life successfully the first time around, and Derrickson has already said he’s got ideas for a sequel. At this point, fans are just waiting on official confirmation about the director’s contract extension. \nSo, what did you think about Doctor Strange ?
