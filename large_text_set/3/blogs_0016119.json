A few of you [media] waited around for an interview after.   \n\"Then of course the story is out there and people pick it up and jump on it and you're getting death threats about your family, kids, everything. On social media, you name it - walking down the street. To be honest I get them every week. \n\"Football fans don't seem to like me. I just get on with it but when people are trying to cut your missus up while she's driving along, with the kids in the back of the car, it's not the best. It's happened plenty of times. \n\"It is terrifying. All that can happen is they get banned on Twitter. People get cut up but if there's no cameras you're screwed.\" Leicester's Champions League defeat at Sevilla was Ranieri's last game in charge \nVardy, who admitted to enjoying winding up opposition fans during games, says any problems with Ranieri during the Italian's reign were sorted out \"man to man\" with a tactics board. \n\"He was happy for you to come in and put your opinion across,\" he said. \"The stories were quite hurtful to be honest with you, a lot of false accusations were being thrown out there and there's nothing us, as players, could do about it. \n\"As soon as they were in the papers they were out there. We just had to put it to the back of our minds and concentrate on the football.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:39:37.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
