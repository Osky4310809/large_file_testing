Here's the latest on Black Panther , The Avengers and The Lego Batman Movie : \n\nBlack Panther Begins Production \nThe next solo Marvel superhero movie is getting into action, as Black Panther announced the start of production today. Along with that news, the studio has shared its complete cast list and an official synopsis. Among the actors confirmed to be joining Chadwick Boseman in the title role are Martin Freeman, reprising his character last seen in Captain America: Civil War , and Andy Serkis, returning as Ulysses Klaue from Avengers: Age of Ultron . John Kani, whose King T'Chaka was killed in Civil War , is also listed. \nAs for the plot, what we get is still rather vague but points out the main story takes place following Civil War , meaning Kani's appearance will probably be in flashback. There will likely have to be some glimpses into the past anyway since the movie's villain, Man-Ape (Winston Duke), is described as someone encountered before. Here's the official language: \"Black Panther follows T’Challa who, after the events of Captain America: Civil War , returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T’Challa’s mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk.\" \n\nThe Avengers Video Game Announced \nMarvel Entertainment's new The Avengers video game won't be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it does seem to be based on the movie version of the team, including a roster of Captain America, Iron Man and Thor. By way of /Film , we got word of the announcement of this release, which we won't learn more about until next year, as well as the following teaser trailer. \n\nThe Lego Batman Movie Behind the Bricks \nUsually when we get a behind-the-scenes featurettes for a new movie, even an animated feature, we see the real people who worked on the release. The Lego Batman Movie version is more of a fake documentary interviewing the characters about their participation in the Lego Movie spin-off, and it's pretty funny. Watch below and see what they've put together on February 10. Like it?
