There is no plan to send emissary to London to see the President. \n“Again, I want to say that the president is hale and hearty in London where he is observing his 10 day vacation. \n“Let us all shun the negative reports insinuating the president illness and death. \n“We implore those behind this outright falsehood to desist. \n“It is because Nigeria exists that they can practice their profession. We implore them to stop overheating the society.’’ \nThe minister told the delegation that his ministry is very passionate about the North-East and has put the region’s concerns and developmental agenda in the front burner of its activities. \nHe explained that until Nigeria took possession of the insurgency war in the region, full rehabilitation, reconstruction and resettlement would not take place. \nAccording to him, the country is winning the war against terror and there is need to celebrate the military that is prosecuting the war. \n“We are also aware there is bigger war to be won which is healing the wounds that have been created by the insurgency. \n“The ministry is particular about ensuring that correct information about the North East is disseminated,’’ he said. \nThe minister said that the PCNI had a tall mandate but expressed confidence in the leader and members of the committee to deliver. \nHe pledged the readiness of his ministry to assist the committee in any way, particularly in information dissemination. \nLeader of the delegation and Chairman PCNEI Economic sub-Committee, Mr Yusuf Yakubu said the committee was committed to restoring stability to the North East through sustainable socio-economic activities. \nIn achieving this, he said the committee harmonised all intervention planning for the region into a national strategic road map tagged “The Buhari Plan’’. \nYakubu solicited partnership with the ministry in mobilisation and changing negative narratives on the Northeast region. \nPCNI was inaugurated by the president under the leadership of Gen. T.Y. Danjuma (rtd.) on Oct. 26, 2016 with three-year mandate to guide, coordinate, facilitate and support all interventions and relief activities across the North East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T18:27:24.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
