The money was sent to the Philippines and was reportedly withdrawn by several ‘Chinese’ men. INQUIRER FILE PHOTO \nWASHINGTON, United States — US federal prosecutors suspect the North Korean government directed last year’s theft of $81 million from Bangladesh’s account at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, according to a media report Wednesday. \nCiting unnamed sources, The Wall Street Journal said prosecutors were developing cases showing Chinese middlemen helped the North Korean government orchestrate the enormous theft from the Bangladesh central bank. \nIn February 2016, thieves transferred the funds from Bangladesh’s account at the New York Fed to accounts in the Philippines using authenticated international bank access codes in the SWIFT system, not by hacking the bank. ADVERTISEMENT \nIt was unclear when or if any charges would be filed but any case might implicate North Korea without charging North Korean officials. \nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AFP. \nResearchers at the security firm Symantec previously had linked the huge theft to a series of cyber-attacks on the US financial system and the 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures.
