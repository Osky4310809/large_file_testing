He is now scheduled to make $16.25 million over the next five seasons, an average of $3.25 million in annual salary. That puts him near the middle of Pac-12 coaches in salary, according to a database of coaches’ salaries published by USA Today. \nMacIntyre, 51, who recently completed his fourth season as CU’s coach, earned the significant raise after guiding the Buffs to a remarkable turnaround season in 2016. After going 10-27 in his first three seasons, MacIntyre led the Buffs to a 10-4 mark this season that included a Pac-12 South Division title and an appearance in the conference championship game. \nIt was the first winning season for the Buffs since 2005 and allowed them to qualify for their first bowl game since 2007. CU lost to Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 29. MacIntyre earned about $400,000 in bonuses this season. \nCU’s eight Pac-12 victories this season were three more than the combined total it had won since joining the conference in 2011. The Buffs’ seven-game improvement in league play from last season marked the biggest turnaround in Pac-12 history. \n“I am ecstatic that we will be at University of Colorado for the foreseeable future; there’s no place my family and I would rather be,” MacIntyre said in a statement. “We absolutely love it here, the people have been great and I truly believe this is just the beginning.” \nMacIntyre has won seven of the eight national coach of the year awards for which he has been nominated this season. He can make it a clean sweep if he wins the American Football Coaches Association award, which will be presented Tuesday. \n“We’re really happy about extending Mike’s contract out through 2021,” CU athletic director Rick George said in a news release. “Continuity and consistency are the most important factors for us as we continue to build our program. So we’re obviously excited that he we will continue to serve in that leadership role.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:29:27.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
