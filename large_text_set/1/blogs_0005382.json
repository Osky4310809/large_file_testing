The group has been established inside the U.S. since the early 1980s, and changed its name from Jamaat al-Fuqra to Muslims of America only in order to distance itself in the eyes of Americans from the known terrorist activity of the former group.   \nOne 2007 FBI report indicated that MOA members were suspected of having been “involved in at least 10 murders, one disappearance, three firebombings, one attempted firebombing, two explosive bombings and one attempted bombing.” \nThe report read: “The documented propensity for violence by this organization supports the belief the leadership of the MOA extols membership to pursue a policy of jihad or holy war against individuals or groups it considers enemies of Islam, which includes the U.S. government. Members of the MOA are encouraged to travel to Pakistan to receive religious and military/terrorist training from Sheikh Gilani.” \n“The MOA is now an autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S,” the report added. \nA prior 2003 FBI report stated, “Investigation of the Muslims of the Americas (sic) is based on specific and articulate facts giving justification to believe they are engaged in international terrorism.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T01:11:33.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
