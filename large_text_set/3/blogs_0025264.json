He is the curator of ‘New Dawn?’ an exhibition on Labour’s 1997 General Election victory at the People’s History Museum, Manchester, which opened this weekend \nNo it’s not the end of the Labour Party, not for the foreseeable future. It’s not fair, but the electoral system will come to Labour’s aid, because there is no clear alternative to it. We have a first-past-the-post system that gives a bias to the two parties with the most national coverage and, just as it saved the Labour Party in 1983, when the SDP/Liberal alliance came within a few hundred thousand votes of it, it will remain – by some distance – the official opposition, a position from which it can potentially recover. \nBut to be the majority party it has to create a coalition of shared interests. At the moment Labour has not got a leader who can do that. He can appeal to only one constituency – liberal, metropolitan types – but not Labour’s more traditional supporters. \nHe’s got the trade union types too, and they’re necessary, but he is in danger of completely scuppering its traditional supporter base. The distance between those two groups was clearly revealed in the referendum, but it has always been there. \nThere are conjunctural things happening. Even if it were a centre left party, where does Labour go in an age of austerity? What does it say when immigration is such an important, divisive issue? What does it say about internationalism while patriotism is so important? \nBut there is a short term positional thing thing too. Whatever its politics, it is incapable of providing – in the the short term – conventional leadership. Its leader is unwilling or unable to play the game: to look like a leader, to act like a leader, to present people with an aura of competence. It is necessary to be seen as a serious candidate. \nThe other things won’t change dramatically once Corbyn goes – and the longer he is leader the worse it is for Labour – he may get replaced by a more adept person that can share his policies but be more fluid and flexible \nSo there is a short term political crisis, but the broader crisis for the party pre-existed Corbyn. \nThese two things coming together look like an existential crisis but the electoral system, and the lack of viable alternatives, do mean that the party will linger on. \nPeter Frankopan is a historian at Oxford University. ‘The Silk Roads: A New History of the World’ is published by Bloomsbury \nWhen the Titanic hit the iceberg, it wasn’t the impact that was the problem. It was the extent of the damage under the waterline. Labour now looks doomed. \nThe problem of disastrous legacy of Blair and Brown governments is bad enough – the shattered economy; the spin; the Iraq war; and the total loss of credibility. But that is now coupled with the shuffling of the deckchairs as Labour sinks, with the attention of senior crew members turning not to Brexit, inequality and austerity and things that matter but to a vicious internal battle to control the wheel house of a stricken vessel. \nIt’s time to abandon ship. All hopes now turn to the Liberal Democrats – whose sinking under similar circumstances 100 years ago opened the door for Labour. And they say history doesn’t repeat itself… \nGiles Udy is a historian of Soviet Communism. His latest book, ‘Labour And The Gulag’ (Biteback, £30) is published 20 April \nIn some ways it’s familiar – Labour turns against a charismatic former leader that took the party twice to Downing Street (Ramsay MacDonald then, Tony Blair today) and lurches to the left in disillusion after its subsequent defeat. \nBut this is not the 1930s. Although Lenin instructed British communists to infiltrate the party and subvert it from within, each attempt was resisted. Whenever the CPGB tried to affiliate it was resolutely blocked. “Entryism” was rejected wherever it appeared. \nIn the 1980s, Militant tried it again, attacking the PLP and demanding mandatory reselection (sounds familiar?). When its members were expelled the purge was led by party leader Neil Kinnock, something that today, from Corbyn, would be unthinkable. The shadow Chancellor declares himself a Leninist; Trotskyites have signed up en masse, and entryism has now virtually become party policy. Can Labour recover? History says “no”.
