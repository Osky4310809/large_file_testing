A huge thanks to This Old House for sharing their time and valuable knowledge with us. \nMiss it? Don't worry! Here's the link! \nThe link is also below in our AMA section! \nNew to reddit? Click here! \nTips: \nThese are not the posting guidelines. Please see above. \nIf you're asking for help, please give details. Pictures can help. Please do basic research first and illustrate what research you've done in your post. \nIf you're sharing your DIY project, please tell us how you did it. Consider putting the finished picture first, however, this is not a requirement. \nAll posts asking for help (specific questions ONLY) must go in a self post, or in the stickied thread at the top of /r/DIY . \nAll posts linking to images must link to an Imgur album. All non-Imgur links will be considered on a link-by-link basis. Please message the moderators with a link to your content for approval. ** \nCivility is a requirement to participate on /r/DIY . While we try to adhere to a \"3 strikes\" policy before banning, mods reserve the right to ban without warning, particularly in regards to offensive comments or content. \nNote: \nIf you only post pictures of a finished project with no detail, the submission will be removed. Consider submitting these types of posts to /r/somethingimade instead. We're trying to keep /r/DIY about the process rather than simply the result . \nA good rule of thumb is somebody who sees your post should be able to relatively get close to being able to replicate the project with the information you've provided \nAMAs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T00:23:51.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
