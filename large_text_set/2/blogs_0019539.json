Viewers were confused (Photo: ITV) Fans thought the show had been hacked (Photo: ITV) \nA confused tweeter wrote: \"Did someone just hack the ITV and slag The 1975 off for their whole performance? Surely not part of the plan?\" \nHowever, fans of the British band rushed to social media to reveal that the performance was basically ripped straight from the group's music video. There were rude messages behind the band (Photo: ITV) \n\"PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO FOR 'THE SOUND' BY THE 1975. IT WAS PART OF THE PERFORMANCE. STOP BEING BASIC,\" wrote one angry fan. \nAnother added: \"It is literally from their music video, as if people think they have been hacked smh I cannot\" But it turns out it was just from their video (Photo: PA) \nThe messages displayed behind the band were actually criticisms the band received following the release of their debut album. \nThey included the insults as a sort of middle finger to the critics, now they've become one of the biggest bands in country. \nDespite their detractors, it turned out to be great night for the this year, as they managed to beat out Little Mix to Best British Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:28:05.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
