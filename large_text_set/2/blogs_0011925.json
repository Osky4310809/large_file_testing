While Lea Michele and Emma Roberts’s characters might not always get along , the two actresses couldn’t be closer IRL. Michele and Roberts constantly profess their love for each other on social media, and we really can’t get enough of this dynamic duo. Paps keep catching them out doing adorable things like shopping together and holding hands on scary amusement park rides , and it’s no surprise that Lea had the cutest message for Emma yesterday on the ultimate Scream Queen’s 26th birthday.\n✨Happy Birthday✨ to truly the best friend a girl could ask for.. I love you Emma. There is no one I laugh harder with, would rather call in the middle of the night or blast the Wreckers with all day... thank you for always being there for me. Love you so much. ✨❤ \nA photo posted by Lea Michele (@leamichele) on Feb 10, 2017 at 8:19am PST \nMichele’s sweet caption reads, Happy Birthday to truly the best friend a girl could ask for.. I love you Emma. There is no one I laugh harder with, would rather call in the middle of the night or blast the Wreckers with all day… thank you for always being there for me. Love you so much \nShe posted the same picture on Twitter to celebrate Roberts’s birthday with the caption: “Happy birthday to this beautiful babe.. my best friend, the Betty to my Veronica.. love you” Clearly Emma Roberts is a really good actress as it sounds like she’s nothing like Chanel Oberlin.\n\nvia GIPHY \nRoberts responded to Michele’s message on Twitter and she was clearly feeling the co-star’s love.\nThank you babe. Love you !!!! https://t.co/5IahNvsSBZ \n— Emma Roberts (@RobertsEmma) February 10, 2017 Is there anything better than female BFFship?\n\n*Sigh* that would be a hard N-O.\nThis isn’t the first time Michele has called herself and Roberts Betty and Veronica.\nBetty and Veronica #ewpopfest \nA photo posted by Lea Michele (@leamichele) on Oct 30, 2016 at 4:50pm PDT \nTheir overt Riverdale fandom makes us dream of a Scream Queens-Riverdale crossover. Honestly, that could be totally cool! However, Betty and Veronica aren’t the only dynamic duo that Michele and Roberts compare themselves to. Lea posted a picture of the BFFs with the caption, Channeling our inner Bella & Gigi \nChanneling our inner Bella & Gigi @emmaroberts \nA photo posted by Lea Michele (@leamichele) on Oct 7, 2016 at 4:11pm PDT \nOh, and have we mentioned that they work out together too? Maybe they should also be calling themselves Venus and Serena while they’re at it.\nLove working out and working with my favorite girl @msleamichele @vanessaroberts85 thanks for kicking our butts before work on #ScreamQueens \nA photo posted by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Sep 10, 2015 at 2:08pm PDT \nEmma and Lea have the cutest co-star friendship since Jen Aniston and Courtney Cox and we are 100% here for it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:38:26.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
