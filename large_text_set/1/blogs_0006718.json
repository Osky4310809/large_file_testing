He got out of the car and stepped into the path of the big rig. \n“He suffered a major hit but to last knowledge, he is still alive at this point,” Bradley said. \nThe driver of the big rig truck was interviewed and then released by the CHP, facing no injuries, according to Bradley. \nSouthbound traffic was diverted off at Laguna Boulevard, roughly a mile north of the Elk Grove Boulevard exit. \nOne lane reopened by 10:30 a.m. All lanes were cleared by 10:45 a.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T18:53:51.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
