Ek Duje Ke Vaaste completed one year and the fans have something special for the team. Here is why we miss the showâ€¦ Updated:   17:47   \nSony TV's show Ek Duje Ke Vaaste didn't get the required TRPs but it definitely got immense love from people. Unfortunately, the show went off air. There were many speculations but the clear reason for the show going off air is not known!The fans were extremely upset as their favourite show went off air. They started an online drive and even barged into the Sony TV office asking not to stop the show. Still the fans have been showering love to the show and the team even after the show went off air!It has to be recalled that the fans had sent a 20 feet flex to the Sony channel requesting for EDKV 2. The show that started on February 29 has turned one year old now. And, the fans have a lot of surprise in store. The fans are printing a banner with \"Anniversary, #1YearOfEDKV, 29th Feb 2016 and Namik Paul and Nikita Dutta's picture\" on it. Read on to know why we miss the show.... EDKV Actors \nNot just Shravan (Namik) and Suman (Nikita), every actor in the show impressed the audiences. Nanaji (Madan Joshi), Aditya (Ronit Kapil), Nirmala (Geetanjali Tikekar), Satyajit Sharma (Ramnath), Kamini (Anjali Mukhi), Pushkar (Ranjeet Singh), Preeti (Aditi Rathore) and many other actors did justice to their roles. EDKVâ€™s Story \nThe story was the main attraction. It didn't have a saas-bahu drama like other shows. It was just about Shravan and Suman's story, and how Kamini tried to spoil their relation (ek villain to banta hai, else how will the show run)! (Image Source: Instagram) ShraManâ€™s Childhood Memories \nWe loved the childhood memories of Shravan and Suman. Their nhok-jhok and how Suman dominated Shravan in childhood, which was shown as flashbacks on the show, were too cute! Shravan & Sumanâ€™s Love \nShravan just wanted to take revenge on Suman as she left him 10 years back. Although the duo loved each other, their ego never let them express their love. They had soft corners for each other, but never showed it. Sumanâ€™s Strong Nature \nSuman is shown as strong, independent and self-respectful girl. Come whatever may, she never lets anyone bring her down (not even Shravan), and she is one such strong-headed woman. It has to be recalled that she runs her own tiffin service centre. Namik, Nikita & Adityaâ€™s Pictures On Social Mediaâ€¦. \nDuring the show, the trio were active on social media and kept their audiences updated with their on the sets pictures. Now that they are on different paths, we do not or rarely get to see their lively pictures together. Namik & Nikita \nPost EDKV, Namik was seen in a web-series â€˜The Trip' that starred Lisa Haydon. Nikita took a short break and was back with a bang with a music video 'Sun re sajna' with Hriday Gattani. We hope to see both the actors soon on small screen. A few days ago, Namik shared a picture (Facebook memories) and wrote, \"Logged in and saw this. Thank you Facebook for putting a huge smile on my face ðŸ˜Š.\" A post shared by ekdujekevaaste (@ekdujekevaste) on Feb 27, 2017 at 9:50am PST Namik and Nikita were touched by the fans' gesture and they thanked them for their love and support. Namik had even addressed the fans' question about Ek Duje Ke Vaaste Season 2. He had said, \"I haven't heard anything about it. What does this mean? It just means I haven't heard anything about it. Actors are usually the last ones to know anyway.\"He even had said, \"And rest assured, if and when I do hear anything I'll be sure to tell you. Because if Season 2 happens, it'll be due to fan demand so you WILL know for sure.\"We just hope to hear this good news soon! What say guys?\nWell, we must say, even after the channel paying no heed to the fans' request, they haven't stopped. This sweet gesture by fans will melt anybody's heart!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:03:13.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
