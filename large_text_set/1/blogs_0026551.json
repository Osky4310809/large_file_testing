By Helin Jung Kevin A. Roberts Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Sarah Kendzior anticipated a Donald Trump presidency in late 2015 . As a freelance journalist, Kendzior has written extensively about American politics and the economy, but she also has a doctorate in anthropology from her studies on authoritarianism in Central Asian states. She compared Trump to dictators in Central Asia in an article pub lished in The Diplomat almost a year before the New York Times columnist Paul Krugman would write an opinion piece saying the same. Kendzior explains how she got here. As a child growing up in Meriden, Connecticut, I dreamed of someday working for my local paper. That was about as big as my dreams got. I always wanted to be in journalism, but I didn't know any journalists or have any connections. When I was 10, I entered and won a contest to write TV criticism for the kid version of Consumer Reports . Because of that experience, I had this idea that journalism was a meritocracy. I went to Sarah Lawrence College in New York because I got good financial aid and they required an intense amount of writing, which is what I wanted to do. My college years in the late 1990s coincided with a good time for our country. When I look back, I'm not sure if I have nostalgia for college or for the general peacefulness of American life. When I came home from school in the summers, I worked as a cashier and a water bottle inventory counter. I was trying to make enough to get through school. I wanted to do unpaid internships at magazines, but it would have been impossible for me in New York City. I freelanced, doing anything I could find when I could get it, like writing movie reviews for sites and publications that no longer exist. I would cold-pitch editors and say, \"I'm interested in this topic. I'm knowledgeable on this subject.\" I managed to make a small amount of money doing that. I was writing about all kinds of crap that I don't really write about now in order to build up a résumé of clips. When I started, journalism was more lucrative and much easier to get into. I managed to get a job with the New York Daily News right out of college in 2000. I applied through a jobs website for a copy editing position. One of the editors said I might be great for this newsroom job. They had just started their website a couple years before and needed someone who knew really low-level coding. This was before blogs had been invented, so it was an arduous process just to get an article on the internet. You had to manually write in the HTML code. It would take five minutes to upload an article through a system that made a lot of beeping sounds. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The Daily News told me that the hours for the job were from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. At that point, I was so desperate for work that I said, \"Sure, sounds good!\" I was broke. I was eating one bowl of rice a day to save money. I would pretend that I was on Survivor to get through the day. The job was a lot of drudgery, writing tabloid-y, salacious headlines and captions, deciding which stories were on the homepage. I wrote some politics articles, some tech articles. The early 2000s were a very interesting time to be in online journalism. I got to see how print media reconciled with online media. For a long time, the online version of the publication had to be a carbon copy of the print version. Then 9/11 happened. There was a debate about whether or not we should update the Daily News website to let people know that the Twin Towers had fallen. Of course, they decided to update the site, and from then, online news got more interesting. It was horrible to work there in that moment but that was when they realized the value of the internet and breaking news. I eventually pitched a weekly column to my boss, who was receptive to the internet and could see the internet as a companion to print instead of as a competitor. The column was a roundup of world affairs based on foreign media. In 2002, it was still very new to see what Saudi Arabia or Ireland was thinking about something, and because we were in this giant international crisis due to 9/11 and Iraq, I thought it was important for the Daily News ' readership to know what other countries were thinking about. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below I had no real training in journalism — I'm pretty self-taught. I don't believe in the idea of journalism school. I do believe in taking the work seriously, and in reading and writing and observing what other writers have done. You write a lot over a long period of time and you learn what you're doing. I read broadly — the New York Times to Us Weekly . The internet hurt the advertising revenue that makes the print media industry stay afloat. From 2000 to 2003, I watched the industry collapse even as it got more innovative in certain ways. That juxtaposition is heartbreaking for me. Everyone was searching for a well-thought business model. They saw themselves in a bad situation and were trying to dig themselves out. That was the end of journalism being a stable industry. Maybe we wouldn't have the problems we have now with clickbait journalism, media outlets struggling and failing, and investigative reporting being cut if we had figured something out then. I wanted to keep doing journalism but I didn't think it was going to be financially sustainable. When I started at the Daily News , my salary was $40,000. It was $45,000 when I quit a few years later. My apartment rent was $900 in Astoria, Queens, and from what I read now, it's $2,500 for the exact same apartment. I didn't want to live with debt. I got married young, to a coworker at the Daily News . After watching a third of our coworkers get laid off and realizing that we weren't particularly happy working there, my husband and I decided to quit. I had saved up money from freelancing on the side, we didn't have any children, and I wanted to travel. After our honeymoon, we moved to Istanbul and I worked as an English teacher for about a year. I wasn't freelancing at this point because my teaching schedule was so heavy. Kevin A. Roberts Advertisement - Continue Reading Below While I was at the Daily News , I was often reading articles about U.S. military bases in Central Asia and fact-checking articles that mentioned Central Asian states. During my fact-checking, I found obvious errors in these articles, like the capital of the country would be wrong. At the time, there was no Wikipedia or a lot of websites devoted to Central Asia. The more I read about the former Soviet Central Asian states, the more I wanted to do the on-the-ground coverage that was absent in every paper I looked. But I thought it was stupid to go to a country if you don't speak the language or know the culture, so I decided to get an MA at Indiana University and learn Uzbek. I chose Uzbek in part because it's spoken by the most people, not just in Uzbekistan but in parts of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Uzbekistan is the most populous country in Central Asia. I also received, twice, a government-sponsored scholarship to study Uzbek. It paid my tuition and I got a stipend. I loved the language once I started studying it and was actually able to read the literature. This was before Google Translate had Uzbek as an option. There was relatively little written in Uzbek language on the internet. I got access to texts and literature and history that hadn't been translated. It was exciting. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below During my first year as a grad student, in the spring of 2005, the government of Uzbekistan fired on a mass protest of 10,000 people in Andijan, a city in Uzbekistan, and murdered about 700 of them. The government tried to justify the slaughter of civilians by blaming it on a terrorist group that they said was called Akromiya. I found archival research as well as things that were newly available online, all in Uzbek. I spent months translating the materials and came to the conclusion that the government basically fabricated this group. It was just a pretext for the government to oppress its people. There was also Western complicity in this, in that think tanks in the United States were backing the Uzbek government's fairly brutal narrative. The further I dug, the more horrified I was. I wrote it up and submitted it to a peer-reviewed journal where it was accepted for publication. I was warned beforehand that if I published this paper, I would get in trouble with the Uzbek government. I was also told I should have timed the publication until I was ready to go on the job market. I didn't care. It was the truth. This is about people who died — mothers, pregnant women, children who were shot to death. You don't wait on that. I'm really glad I did that because the United Nations and other human rights organizations used it, and people who were accused of being in Akromiya were able to get political asylum in part with that paper as evidence . I went on to get a PhD at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. In 2006, when I started my dissertation on how exiled groups use the internet for political opposition, I was told by other academics that the internet doesn't play a big role in politics. It's funny to look back on it now, when we had a critical election year where the internet played a possibly definitive role in politics. I spent years interviewing Uzbekistan's journalists, intellectuals, politicians, and regular citizens — some of whom live in St. Louis — who were sent into exile after the Andijan massacre. They started using blogs and social media to piece together what had happened in the massacre and to argue about broader issues regarding the state of Uzbekistan, corruption in the government, how to survive as a dissident. I studied how the internet can bring forbidden and controversial content that's censored by the government to the fore, but also how it can instigate infighting.

I had made friends. It was an affordable city. At that point, Al Jazeera asked me to start writing for them about the economy and social atrophy. I worked there for 2 1/2 years as a columnist. They gave me the leeway to talk about a lot of subjects like income inequality that weren't discussed much at the time. I was involved in covering the Ferguson protests heavily in 2014, writing for Al Jazeera and other publications. I don't think I would have been so attuned to what was going on with the police in St. Louis if I hadn't spent so much time interviewing victims of police in Uzbekistan and dispensing with the notion of the police as a universally noble or good-faith party. It was a very difficult time. It's different when it's your own city and it's your friends getting gassed and your neighbors are crying. It took me days to write about it.

Try listening to them instead. #Ferguson — Sarah Kendzior (@sarahkendzior) August 10, 2014 I ended up doing a lot of follow-up coverage: What happened to these activists ? These families ? These communities ? The reality is most people ended up losing their jobs, or struggling, or homeless. They devoted their lives to fighting for justice for Mike Brown's family and racial justice in general, and they didn't get that justice. I transitioned into covering the presidential election in March 2016. I had three advantages in covering Donald Trump specifically as a candidate. First, I worked in New York tabloid media, so I knew exactly how he marketed himself. Then, I studied dictatorships and authoritarian regimes the entire time I was doing my PhD. I learned to speak and read Russian when I was getting my masters. A lot of things that Trump was doing in his campaign reminded me of things I saw in Uzbekistan, Russia, and other authoritarian states around the world. Alarm bells started going off in my head. This was bad. I kept saying that he had a good chance of winning and was dismissed as histrionic or pessimistic. I wish I'd been wrong. Third, I live in the center of the country, not in D.C. or New York. When they talk about how hard things are out here, that's accurate. As the country started to rebuild after the recession, some cities thrived but others really struggled. I felt I was in a losing city. There would be these parachute journalists who would come to talk to people struggling to find jobs and act like they were zoo animals. But these are people I see when I go out to dinner. It's one thing to go to a rally or show up in a place for a few days. It's another thing to live here all year long. I love my city, and I love my state, and I want it to do well. I'm frustrated with how it's been represented. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Trump pretends to speak for the forgotten men and women of the heartland. I am one of those forgotten women. I'm pushed to the sidelines a bit just by virtue of the fact that I live in Missouri. People think, If she were for real, she would live in New York. That's by choice. It allows me some more financial leeway than some of my contemporaries who are bound to the whims of their publishers or worried about their financial situations. But I don't have freedom in terms of my safety. I'm under a lot of attacks now with Trump being elected. I'm a target because I've been a forthright critic. There have been phishing schemes, threats. I'm worried about my safety and my family's safety. The New York Observer wrote a smear piece that singled me out and had inaccuracies; I wasn't contacted for the story. It's unnerving because I'm a journalist from Missouri and the billionaire son-in-law of the president-elect is watching me. I've been writing for Canada's Globe & Mail and other international outlets about politics, which I did on purpose, because I knew that if Trump won, I might lose the ability to criticize him in American publications. I've never felt this unsafe or frightened in the U.S. before. But I want a more informed public. I think a more informed public is a more compassionate public. They're more likely to do the right thing. Get That Life is a weekly series that reveals how successful, talented, creative women got to where they are now.
