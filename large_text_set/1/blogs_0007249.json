ADVERTISEMENT \n“We’ll have to be scrappy, like we always have been,” Compton said over the phone on the way to practice as he preps his Aces for their critical 7 p.m. clash with Star at Smart Araneta Coliseum today. “We’re officially without Noy (Baclao) for the rest of the conference. And that sucks.” \n“We have to continue playing small ball.” \nThe Aces have something to prove to themselves this season, basically a year after blowing a commanding 3-0 lead over San Miguel Beer in the best-of-seven Finals and becoming the first team to lose the series with such a lead. \nCompton has the same material he had last season, but with Baclao out and 6-7 Sonny Thoss still recovering from a leg injury, the road indeed has become uphill, considering that the Beermen are continuing to hold on to the No. 1 spot and playing better than ever. \n“We have to take it one game at a time. If we can go 5-0 then we will take it,” Compton said, referring to their final five elimination round assignments counting this one against the Hotshots, and then, versus Blackwater, Mahindra, Phoenix Petroleum and Rain or Shine, in that order. \n“I just think that there isn’t a team there that can’t beat us, but at the same time, I also believe that there isn’t a team out there that we can’t beat,” he said. \nThe Aces, at 3-3, will be coming off their first loss in the last four games and will be ranged against a Star side that is slowly adapting to its new identity of having Paul Lee as its new franchise player. \nCalvin Abueva will be the main man on both ends for the Aces, especially now with the absence of Baclao and with no natural center remaining in the Alaska lineup. \nWith Baclao and Thoss out, Star has a decided advantage in the middle with Ian Sangalang, Rafi Reavis and Marc Pingris. The Hotshots’ guard and forward rotations are also formidable which would make it interesting to see how Compton counters despite his manpower woes. \nPutting the cuffs on Lee should also be a premium, as the former Rookie of the Year has been leading the Hotshots in scoring while at the same time helping quarterback with great efficiency. \nCompton doesn’t want to talk about a top two berth at this time—just making it past the elimination round. \n“My concern, really, is to get us playing right and get to the playoffs,” he said. “If you’re playing right, anything can happen in the playoffs. We’re playing solid. Our last loss was against a strong TNT (KaTropa) team that just shot great. \n“It wasn’t that we played poorly, but generally we played just decent and TNT played great.” \nWhile Alaska and Star will be coming out in the nightcap trying to enhance their playoff chances, Meralco and Mahindra will bring the curtains up on a regular doubleheader at 4:15 p.m. just trying to stay alive. \nThe Bolts have lost their last four games and, at 2-5, can’t afford another, while the Floodbusters snapped a five-game slide last Christmas to keep their slim hope of advancing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:05:05.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
