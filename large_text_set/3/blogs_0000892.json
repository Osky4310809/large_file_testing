Norwegian parliament has done everything to kill and destroy our wolves this winter, so far no hunt. We can&rsquo;t continue to be silent, now we need your voice to get the Norwegian parliament and parliamentary president. So now I ask you to sign petition against this forces, who do anything to kill and destroy our wolves. Our wolves need YOUR voice, Congress hears only listen to a small group, and Norway has more counties than Hedmark, rest of the country and their residents need to be heard.Information about wolvesWolves in Sweden and Norway are members of a joint cross-boundary Scandinavian wolfpopulation. In both countries, the wolf population is monitored each winter. The SwedishEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Norwegian Environment Agency have made new jointScandinavian guidelines and instructions for monitoring of wolves; these guidelines have nowbeen used since winter 2014-2015.Numbers, distribution and trends in the wolf population in Scandinavia are primarily determinedthrough a survey of family groups and territorial pairs during 1 October - 31 March. The survey ofwolves are done mainly through snow-tracking and DNA-analyses of scats and urine. Informationfrom GPS-collars, other research data and dead wolves are used when available. The CountyAdministrative Boards in Sweden and Hedmark University College together with the NorwegianNature Inspectorate (SNO) in Norway are responsible for collecting field data. They also confirmreports of tracks and other observations by the public. Contributions from the public are veryimportant for wolf monitoring.Number of family groups and scent-marking pairs:During winter 2015-2016, 41 family groups were documented in Scandinavia; 30 within Sweden,four across the Norwegian-Swedish border, and seven within Norway. 29 territorial pairs wereconfirmed; 24 within Sweden, one across the border and four within Norway.Population size:Using the same method as last winter and based on the number of reproductions, Scandinavianwolf numbers were estimated to 430 (95% CI = 340-559), with the Swedish sub-populationestimated to 340 (95% CI = 269-442). The calculation includes both alive and dead wolves duringthe monitoring period. The smaller Norwegian population was counted directly in the field. Aminimum of 25 cross-boundary wolves were counted, in addition to 65-68 individuals found onlyin Norway.Genetics:Four new Finnish-Russian immigrant wolves were confirmed in Scandinavia during the winter2015-2016. Three of these are dead, but the last wolf settled as a new-established pair member.Two previously known Finnish-Russian wolves were still alive in the Swedish part of thepopulation, one reproducing in a family group and one single resident.The estimated average inbreeding coefficient in family groups was 0.24 this winter, a slightdecline since last monitoring season.Update 4.3.017 Thank you for signing and we will update you when something happen Have a nice day :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T14:19:41.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
