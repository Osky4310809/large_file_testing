Nobody would argue with the NHL’s decision; the hit was high and dangerous . \nWith the Stars in town on Tuesday, the Rangers were asked about the coming retribution for the hit. Rangers forward Chris Kreider gave a rather pointed answer. \nKreider on Eakin hit: \"That's not something you forget about. I'm sure someone will have a conversation with him.\" https://t.co/gDOC9LP4Rp \n— Pat Leonard (@PLeonardNYDN) January 16, 2017 So maybe it was no surprise that Kreider did the deed. A minute into the second period, Kreider got tangled with Eakin and they went at it. \nBut during the fight, Kreider took off Eakin’s helmet and hit him with it:\nAccording to NHL Rule 53, Kreider should’ve been ejected from the game: \n53.5 Match Penalty – If a player attempts to or deliberately injures an opponent by throwing a stick or any other object or piece of equipment at an opposing player, he shall be assessed a match penalty.\nYet Kreider only received a five-minute major for fighting. This isn’t the first time officials have missed such a call. In 2014, Willie Mitchell did the same thing and went unpenalized. Whether the NHL picks up on this later this week remains to be seen, but at least the obligatory Eakin fight is out of the way.
