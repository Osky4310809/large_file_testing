(Hannah Foslien/Getty Images) Two protesters, one of whom was wearing a Brett Favre Minnesota Vikings jersey, scaled the rafters at U.S. Bank Stadium and unfurled a banner protesting the bank’s involvement in the Dakota Access Pipeline during the Vikings’ game Sunday.\nFans were cleared from the seats beneath the banner, which bore the words “DIVEST” and “#NoDAPL,” during the second quarter. The protesters continued to dangle, waving and spinning and making calls, as police and fire officials gathered. The game between the Vikings and the Chicago Bears proceeded without interruption, with authorities planning to wait until the stadium had emptied before repelling down to the climbers.\nHe's just hanging to avoid police!
