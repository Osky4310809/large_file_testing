The video will load shortly \nThe EucFACE climate experiment exposes large tracts of remnant native eucalypt forest to treatments of elevated CO2 at 550ppm, which is around 150ppm more than the air that is breathed today. \nThe research is in stark contrast to similar experiments in the United States and Europe, where researchers added extra CO2 to plots in temperate forests and found that trees increased their growth by around 23 per cent. \nAt EucFACE, however, the researchers found that while photosynthesis levels increased consistently by 19 per cent under elevated CO2, it did not translate into increases in wood, stems and leaves over the three-year measurement. \nWhen the researchers added phosphorus to trees under elevated CO2, they found a consistent increase in tree growth of 35 per cent, demonstrating how Australian eucalypts would probably store more carbon from the air if they had access to enough nutrients. \nBecause CO2 levels are gradually rising, scientists believe that within thirty to fifty years the air will contain 550ppm or more of CO2, resulting in potentially massive changes to the climate and the ecosystems that support life on Earth. \n\"Many greenhouse crops such as tomatoes, cut flowers and cucumbers are given added CO2 to make them grow bigger, faster and yield more fruit,\" says Professor Ellsworth. \n\"Yet out in Australia's native forests, conditions for plants are not quite so ideal. Australia's soils are very old and weathered by millions of years of sun and rain, meaning soils are very low in nutrients, and most of the available nutrients are tied up inside wood, leaves and roots. \n\"It means that our soils simply lack the available nutrients that would let trees take advantage of the extra CO2 they find in the air.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:02:58.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
