There are only 30,000 in existence and they’re in the Congo. 12 \nLyrebird – Some birds are noisy and then there’s the lyrebird. It can imitate any sound because of their strong syrnix muscle. We don’t know how many exist, but they live in Australia. 13 \nAxolotl – Not a fish, but actually a salamander that can regrow lost limbs and heal itself. Native to Mexico and is also called the “Mexican Walking Fish” 14 \nGolden Tortoise Beetle – This color-changing bug goes from gold to red when it’s mad or mating. There’s not a lot of information on them besides that they are only in the Americas. 15 Wikimedia/Stefan Brending \nIrrawaddy Dolphin – They are more similar to killer whales than dolphins, but they can squirt water to help herd fish when they are hungry. This type of dolphin is super rare and can only be found in the Bay of Bengal and and Southeast Asia coast. Advertisement Advertisement 16 \nNarwahl – They don’t just exist in Elf, they are real! Narwahls have a 50-year life span and a unicorn-like horn that can grow up to 10 feet. There are only 75,000 left and they primarily live in the waters around Russia, Greenland, and the Canadian Arctic. 17 \nTurritopsis Dohrnii aka ‘The Immortal Jellyfish”– A very small jellyfish that can never die. When it reaches the end of its life cycle it folds in on itself and transforms back into its early stages before growing into an adult jellyfish again. Super weird sea creature that lives in the Mediterranean Sea. \nThanks again for another great iCHIVE gallery.
