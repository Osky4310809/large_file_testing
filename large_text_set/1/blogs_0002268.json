PMDD then re-emerged when the hormones were re-introduced. \nResearchers then compared white blood cells in women with PMDD and those without, which confirmed that it impacts a woman’s cellular response to sex hormones. \nThe findings come after experts from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) said that women with PMS should be offered cognitive behavioural therapy.
