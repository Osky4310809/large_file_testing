Asymmetrically loaded Bulgarian hip hinge \nYou're more likely to see a unicorn than witness someone performing a single-leg hip hinge (also referred to as a single-leg stiff-legged deadlift or RDL) correctly. That's why I love the Bulgarian hip hinge for hamstring, glute, and back development. Elevating the back foot gives you just enough stability to feel the movement in the support leg without having to constantly reset for balance. It's kind of like a kickstand on a bike. Now you can focus on keeping your hips and shoulders square and moving at the hip through a full range of motion. The offset loaded versions I show in the video below are also amazing: A post shared by BJ Gaddour (@bjgaddour) on Mar 2, 2017 at 10:36am PST \nThe asymmetrical load fires up the entire glute complex as you stabilize in multiple planes of motion. In fact, most people would consider this to be primarily a hamstring exercise, but it consistently gives me a superior glute burn compared to some other direct glute exercises. \nIt's also a lie detector test for your ability to maintain a stable tripod foot position. I'm weakest on my left leg with the dumbbell in my right hand: My big toe always wants to keep popping off the ground. Fixing/addressing this type of stuff prevents unwanted wear and tear in higher impact, higher-volume activities like running and jumping. \nDo 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps per arm on each leg while maintaining a flat back, even if that means modifying the range of motion or using just your bodyweight in the beginning. If you wanted to go heavier for more strength work, do 4 to 6 reps per arm. If you wanted to go lighter for more endurance work, do 15 to 20 reps per arm. Do this at least 1 to 2 times per week and your glutes will grow, your hamstrings and hips will open up, and you'll start moving and feeling better. It's also very easy on the knees! \n2. Staggered-stance landmine hip hinge \nThese are also great for the glutes, hams, and lower back. And if you struggle with the aforementioned Bulgarian hip hinge, you may find these to be more accessible. A post shared by BJ Gaddour (@bjgaddour) on Mar 18, 2017 at 3:50pm PDT \nI place the opposite hand behind the lower back to both mobilize the chest/anterior shoulder and to ensure the slight arch in the low back is maintained. These are also self-limiting due to the grip challenge of holding the fat part of the bar. In other words, it's inherently a pretty safe variation if you have a history of back pain. \nPlus, using the plates ensures you can never go too low, or lower than trunk parallel to the floor. It's fine to go lower (and I'd recommend it if you can do it without rounding your spine), but most people don't have the mobility and stability to do that. \nDo 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 15 reps per side with 30 to 60 seconds rest between sides. For best results, mix between both of these variations over the course of a given training week for the next 6 to 12 weeks. \nP.S.
