Finance department has no clue, AG finds The Conference Board study for the CDA suggests someone earning $45,000 in full-time employment in Ontario, with family coverage, would pay an extra $1,167 in tax. Those earning $60,000 in that province would pay an additional $1,043, while workers earning $90,000 would pay $1,277 more. Those numbers are reasonably consistent across the country, except (it almost goes without saying) in Quebec, where those earning $90,000 would pay a combined $1,729. Obviously, if two wage-earners in the same family have coverage, that amount will double.\nThe prospect of health and benefit taxation being included in the spring budget was first raised by the National Post last month. \nThe subject was subsequently brought up by the opposition Conservatives in the House of Commons and by journalists with the prime minister at his end-of-year press conference.\nThe government’s talking points have been consistent — no decisions have been taken and any move would not be made in isolation. However, health-care organizations remain deeply worried that the proposal is still on the table.\nThe Liberals have been at pains to point out this would not be a tax grab, aimed at getting their hands on the $2.9 billion that could be levied (at least in year one), if health and dental benefits were treated as income in the same manner as company cars or life insurance.\nThe government has confirmed a review of health and dental benefits was undertaken by a panel of seven academics, who looked at a range of tax credits (particularly those that benefit high-income Canadians), with the goal of making the tax system as fair, efficient and simple as possible.\nThe academic argument in favour of taxing health and dental is straightforward — most employee benefits are taxed but, for reasons lost in the mists of past public policy, health and dental coverage is not. The argument for taxation is that those without private health plans, often people on low income, are subsidizing those who have them, generally people in the public sector or those who work in large companies.\nReforming the taxation of benefits has been advocated by the Department of Finance for years.\nIt was also endorsed by an advisory panel on health-care innovation, chaired by former University of Toronto president David Naylor, in 2015. The Naylor report suggested ending the current system and introducing a “tax swap,” where the government brought in a refundable tax credit to help all Canadians purchase private insurance. The problem with this solution is that it would add additional cost to provide a decent level of coverage — around $1 billion in the Naylor report.\nThis is not a government that is looking to spend more money, in what is likely to be a bad news budget.\nA more cost-effective course of action for the Liberals would be to highlight the existing medical expense tax credit (METC). Making benefits taxable makes them eligible for reimbursement under the METC.\nThe Conference Board report points out that for those earning less than $45,000, the increased income-tax burden would be cancelled out by claiming the existing tax credit.\nThe problem is that only 17 per cent of Canadians ever get around to claiming this credit — and it would not offset the cost increase for those earning more than $45,000.\nAs a result, the potential exists for a massive political backlash.\nThe health-care coalition points out that when Quebec taxed health and dental benefits in 1993, it resulted in a substantial loss of coverage.\nOnce benefits were subject to provincial income tax, there was a 14-per-cent decrease in employee-provided supplementary health coverage in the province.\nIf those levels were repeated nationally, the revenues from the new tax would be much reduced and many Canadians would be forced to buy expensive private coverage (an average $3,521 a year for a family plan).\nMeddling with the equilibrium of the private/public health mix has the potential for unintended consequences.\nBut this is a government that has already proven itself in favour of income tax “fairness” for the middle class “and those working hard to join them.”\nIf taxing the health and dental benefits of the top 30 per cent of earners yields revenues to fund other social engineering experiments, as far as the Liberals are concerned, so much the better.\nNational Post \n• Email: jivison@nationalpost.com | Twitter: IvisonJ \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T00:15:36.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
