Now the Korean publication Hankyung is suggesting something similar. As per the report, Samsung is planning to re-release the Galaxy Note7 as a refurbished device. \nAs per the report, Samsung will sell the refurbished Galaxy Note7 to minimise revenue damage and avoid environmental costs. The refurbished units of the flagship will pack in a smaller battery than the original’s 3,500mAh unit. The Note7 will likely be launched in India, Vietnam and other emerging markets. The brand may also consider selling the handset in its home market of South Korea ahead of the launch of the Galaxy Note8. Involved divisions will finish refurbishing the Note 7 by May and begin selling the phones as early as June, the report added. \nThe report suggests that the refurbished Galaxy Note7 will pack in a battery capacity between 3,000mAh and 3,200mAh. The brand has recovered 98 percent of the 3.16 million Galaxy Note7s sold so far. The company has 2.5 million units left in stock after using 20,000 devices in testing to find the cause of the recall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:13:20.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
