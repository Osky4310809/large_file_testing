Photo Santa Monica firefighters worked to revive a dog, Nalu, after pulling him from a burning apartment on Tuesday. Credit Billy Fernando It wasn’t looking good for Nalu. The small, floppy-eared dog inhaled a lot of smoke after a fire erupted at a Santa Monica apartment on Tuesday. The fire was quickly put out. Nalu, a 10-year-old bichon frise-shih tzu mix, was limp and not breathing. \nAdvertisement “He was essentially dead,” said Andrew Klein, the firefighter who pulled the dog from the burning home. \nAdvertisement Mr. Klein set Nalu on the grass and began delivering oxygen with a specialized pet mask and performing mouth-to-snout resuscitation. \nAdvertisement Minutes passed. Nothing. Photo Crystal Lamirande, the dog’s owner, was distraught as Andrew Klein administered oxygen to the animal. Credit Billy Fernando Kneeling nearby, the dog’s owner, Crystal Lamirande, who had been running errands when the blaze broke out, was distraught. She put her hand on the dog’s belly. “Come on Nalu,” she said. Then, an improbable 20 minutes after efforts to revive him began, Nalu blinked and, slowly, his chest rose. \nAdvertisement Ms. Lamirande, 35, a nurse, had just lost her home. Yet for the moment she was elated. “She couldn’t stop saying, ‘Thank you,’” said Billy Fernando , a passer-by who watched the drama. Photo After about 20 minutes, Nalu was revived. Ms. Lamirande embraced the dog. Credit Billy Fernando Speaking by phone Thursday, Ms. Lamirande said Nalu was back to his old self. “He’s so lovely. People just love him,” she said. Ms. Lamirande said she lost sentimental objects in the fire, whose origin was unknown. But she was coping, she added, “It’s just stuff.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.
