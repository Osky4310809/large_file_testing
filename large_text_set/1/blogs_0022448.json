The \"Bad Blood\" singer has carefully maintained a large group of female friends ( her \"squad\" ), spoken at length about her feminist renaissance , and preached on a number of occasions about the importance of not tearing other women down, despite her highly-publicized feud with another female pop star suggesting otherwise. Everyone from Demi Lovato to Rowan Blanchard has called out Taylor for her \"false feminism\" , saying that she's all talk when it comes to women's rights, criticisms that resurfaced this weekend. On Saturday, Taylor tweeted a heartfelt message about the Women's March , which was attended by over two million men and women (including fellow singers like Katy Perry, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Madonna, and Ariana Grande). It appears that Taylor did not march. So much love, pride, and respect for those who marched. I'm proud to be a woman today, and every day. #WomensMarch \n— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) January 21, 2017 \nDespite her positive tweet, she was soon bombarded by people who claim she only wants to be a feminist when it's convenient to her. Many wondered why she hasn't been politically active for the last few months until now. @taylorswift13 This is gross opportunism. Be better. \n— Chris Rollins (@chrisrollins_) January 22, 2017 @taylorswift13 but where were you during the entire election?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:05:59.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
