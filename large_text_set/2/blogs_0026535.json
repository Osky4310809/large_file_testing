The phone’s on-screen buttons surfaced a couple of times thus far, as it seems like Samsung is ditching the physical home key in order to trim down those bezels. Well, according to a new leak, those on-screen buttons might be customizable, as they are on some competing smartphones. LG has been offering this feature on their devices for quite some time now, and the same goes for Huawei. \nIf you take a look at the images down below, which have been grabbed from a leaked video which shows off the Galaxy S8 in a working state, you’ll notice that the on-screen button order can be changed. In addition to the ability to reorder the position of the back, home and overview (multitasking) keys, you can also place the pull down the notification shade button next to those three on-screen buttons as well. This sure is a welcomed addition, as some people still don’t like the fact that Samsung’s devices have the back button on the right, and the overview (multitasking) button on the left, which is the company’s current setup when it comes to their devices with capacitive keys. Those are pretty much all the Galaxy-branded smartphones that have been released in the last couple of years, as the company utilizes physical home key which is flanked by overview (multitasking) key on the left, and the back button on the right. \nSamsung confirmed that the Galaxy S8 will land on March 29, and along with it, almost certainly the Galaxy S8 Plus as well. This announcement was made during the company’s MWC 2017 event in Barcelona two days ago, though we still don’t know when will the phone go on sale. The Galaxy S8 will be fueled by the Snapdragon 835 SoC in the US, but the Exynos 8895 CPU will almost certainly fuel the phone in a number of other markets. Android Nougat will come pre-installed on the device, along with the company’s custom UI, and the phone will be made out of metal and glass. If rumors are to be believed, the Galaxy S8 will sport a 5.8-inch QHD Super AMOLED display, while the ‘Plus’ variant will arrive with a 6.2-inch QHD Super AMOLED panel. In any case, stay tuned, chances are we’ll see quite a few additional leaks before Samsung introduces the Galaxy S8.
