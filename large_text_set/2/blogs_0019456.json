No arrests had been made as of Tuesday. \nAsked on Monday whether the incident is being investigated as a hate crime, Detective Lt. Fredrick Lemons II said police were keeping all options open. \nBut Tuesday he said, “There’s nothing to indicate it was any type of hate crime.” \nOfficials are reviewing a weekend’s worth of video from the area for information. They have not yet narrowed down the time the vandalism happened, but they believe it occurred between Friday evening and Sunday morning. Lemons wouldn’t say if they had found anything on tape so far that looks suspicious. \nGov. Eric Greitens denounced the vandalism as a “despicable act” in a post late Monday on his Facebook page . In a later post, he said he planned to join volunteers to help clean up the cemetery on Wednesday. \n“One measure of a community’s strength is what we do in moments like this,” he said in the later post. “We can choose to cower, or we can choose productive action and shared service.” \nIn Jefferson City, state Rep. Stacey Newman, D-Clayton, called on her colleagues in the House to stand for a moment of silence to recognize what she called an “act of hatred.” \nNewman, who has family buried in the cemetery, stood with Rep. Joe Adams, a Democrat whose district includes the cemetery. \n“This desecration has devastated the whole St. Louis community,” Newman said. “The grief and the sadness of this act is overwhelming. Completely overwhelming.” \nU.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., called the damage an “affront to values we hold dear as Americans.” \nThe Anti-Defamation League offered a $10,000 reward in the case . \nMeanwhile, national and local religious communities are coming to the cemetery’s aid. Brooklyn-based social justice activist Linda Sarsour started the fundraising campaign Muslims Unite to Repair Jewish Cemetery to raise money for repairs. Within a few hours, the online campaign surpassed its original $20,000 goal. \nAll Nations Church, a Lutheran church in University City, was also among those trying to raise money for the cleanup. Its pastor, Chris Paavola, said of the vandalism: “This is just intolerable. It’s a hateful act.” \nImam Mufti Asif Umar of the Islamic Federation of Greater St. Louis called the incident “a horrific and disgusting act … which cannot be tolerated.” \nThe Imam Council of Metropolitan St. Louis, which represents 18 Islamic centers in the region, planned to encourage Muslim congregations to donate to help with cemetery repairs. \nThe desecration was discovered the same day several Jewish community centers around the country received bomb threats, according to officials. \nOn a visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture on Tuesday, President Donald Trump denounced anti-Semitic acts and said “it’s going to stop, and it has to stop.” \nIn the past he has drawn criticism for not denouncing anti-Semitic groups who support him. Trump said the threats to Jewish communities were a “painful and sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.” \nAndy Cohen, the host of “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” on Bravo, decried the vandalism in his hometown . He said his great-grandparents and many other of his relatives are buried at the cemetery. \nAccording to its website , the cemetery at Hanley Road and Olive Boulevard dates to 1893. The damage was done to an older part, on the southeast end. In one swath, for example, spread across about 40 yards, two dozen stones are toppled, but 10 rows of stones nearby are untouched. \nAnita Feigenbaum, executive director of the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery, said officials were cataloging the damage Tuesday. \nPeople should call the office for more information about which headstones were vandalized. People can also donate to the cemetery through the website or the Jewish Federation of St. Louis . \nFeigenbaum was emotional in describing the damage she saw. “It’s hard to even express how terrible it was,” she said Tuesday morning. “It was horrible.” \nVisitors streamed in to see if their family stones were pushed over. \nJudy Sipkin of Creve Coeur heard about the vandalism from her daughter in Dallas, who saw the story on Facebook. Sipkin and her sister, Marla Levinson, rushed out to survey the damage. \nThe headstones of their parents, grandparents and aunts and uncles were all fine. Levinson snapped a photo of one toppled stone — Rubenstein, her mother-in-law’s name — and was sending the photo to her husband to see if the name matched his side of the family. \n“It’s unbelievably disrespectful, just a shame,” she said. “Nobody’s saying it’s a hate crime, but it certainly wasn’t love or a compassionate situation.” \nThe sisters said they hoped the vandalism was a juvenile prank. “Let’s hope it was children who don’t know better,” Levinson said, “instead of a white supremacist group. That’s a whole different ballgame.” Close 1 of 12 Robert Cohen \nRabbi Hershey Novack of the Chabad center conducts a Skype interview for Israeli television at Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in University City on Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2017 where almost 200 gravestones were vandalized over the weekend. \"People who are Jewish are shocked and angry,\" Novack told the interviewers.
