The city currently requires protesters to apply a week in advance. \nIn his ruling, Martinez wrote that exceptions to the seven-day rule should be made if the protest relates to the mission of the airport and the issue is of immediate concern, such as the travel ban. \nThe city must “make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the applicant’s preferred demonstration location, whether inside or outside of the Jeppesen Terminal, so long as the location is a place where the unticketed public is normally allowed to be,” Martinez wrote. \nMartinez issued the injunction in response to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Nazli McDonnell and Eric Verlo, who both went to DIA two days after Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order restricting the travel and immigration of people from seven Muslim-majority countries to the U.S. \n“We are gratified that the judge understands the importance of the First Amendment,” said Mari Newman, a Denver civil rights attorney who represented the plaintiffs. “We’re living in a time that there is no way to anticipate anything the government will do. This acknowledges the imperative that protesters can speak immediately on issues of public concern and in a manner in which their message can be heard.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:57:04.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
