Photo courtesy of Homepolish \nWhen it came to designing their new headquarters, interior design startup Homepolish wanted to focus on what cofounder and CEO Noa Santos considers the most important factor for any office: providing employees with a variety of workspaces. \n\"You have to give people the variety of space so that no matter how many employees you have, they can curate their own working experience,\" Santos told Business Insider. \nThat sensibility, combined with Santos' creative eye, led to what are now Homepolish's gorgeous new headquarters in New York City's Flatiron District . Homepolish's more than 500 designers have designed beautiful homes as well as offices for other startups across the US. Ahead, take a look at how they decked out their own digs. View As: One Page Slides Santos, who was head designer on the project, wanted to make sure the new office had plenty of natural light. \"We came from a space with great light, and we wanted to make sure that we stayed in a place with great light,\" Santos said.

The startup also has an office in Austin, Texas. Photo courtesy of Homepolish Creating various workspaces and conferences rooms was key.

You want to make sure you outfit an office with a variety of environments.\" Photo courtesy of Homepolish He also wanted to make sure the office felt cozy.

Photo courtesy of Homepolish \"I want [the space] to feel lived-in. Even if it's tailored and clean and crisp, it should feel like it's natural,\" he said. Photo courtesy of Homepolish A big part of that was creating a kitchen space that had a more residential look, rather than commercial. \"People can feel like they're in a larger version of their home,\" he said.

Photo courtesy of Homepolish Santos noted that the current decor isn't entirely permanent: \"Design is supposed to evolve as you do â€” think of it like your wardrobe, you should constantly be thinking about how the spaces you live and work in can evolve and change to address your needs and your aesthetics as they change, and to be OK with that.\" Photo courtesy of Homepolish To describe the vibe of the Homepolish headquarters, Santos said: \"Tailored, effortless, and fun.\" Photo courtesy of Homepolish", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T20:06:02.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
