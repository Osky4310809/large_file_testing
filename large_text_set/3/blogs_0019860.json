In February, Brzezinski banned Conway from appearances on \"Morning Joe.\"\n\"It's not worth the interview,\" Brzezinski had said of Conway.\n\"Mika, your recent remarks about Kellyanne Conway carried a lot of weight. One could argue that her TV presence has diminished to a degree. Do you still feel the same way about having her on the air?\" Steinberg asked Brzezinski.\n\"I feel even more so that everyone should ban her. I’m surprised that these little acrobatic games are played with her on live national television. I think it denigrates what we do. It’s clear she doesn’t bring anything to the table,\" Brzezinski said.\nThen Scarborough jumped in with a quip about Conway's March 12 microwave remark , when she said microwaves could be used for surveillance.\n\"Mika, she did teach us about microwaves,\" Scarborough said.\nBrzezinski then claimed her microwave is named after Trump's former campaign manager.\n\"That’s true, and now my microwave is named Kellyanne,\" Brzezinski said. \"And every time I open it, which is frequently, because I don’t cook, I say, ‘Thank you, Kellyanne!'\"\nThe post Mika Brzezinksi Hits Conway Again, Says Her Microwave is Named ‘Kellyanne’ appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:13:31.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
