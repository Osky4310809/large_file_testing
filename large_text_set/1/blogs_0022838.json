I think she hurt herself very badly. I think she hurt that whole cause,\" Mr Trump told Fox News interviewer Sean Hannity. \n\"I thought her and a couple of others. But I thought she was in particular, I thought what she said was disgraceful to our country.\" Trump on @Madonna “Honestly, She’s Disgusting” — DeplorableLeft #MAGA (@Deplorable_Left) January 27, 2017 \nHe blasted Saturday Night Live and the \"terrible\" attack by one of its writers, Katie Rich, against his son, Barron, where she said he would become America’s \"first homeschool shooter\". \n\"Saturday Night Live, a person from Saturday Night Live was terrible,\" he said. \n\"I don't mind some humour but it's terrible. For them to attack, for NBC to attack my 10-year-old son, it’s a disgrace. He’s a great boy. And it’s not an easy thing for him. Believe me.\" \nMs Rich has since apologised and been suspended by the show. \nBut Mr Trump wasn't done with the popular Saturday night comedy satire that has featured Alec Baldwin mocking the billionaire property tycoon for months. \nThe president said Mr Baldwin wasn't just unfunny but a \"disaster\". \"He's terrible on the show,\" he added. Madonna says 'we have gone as low as we can go' with Trump result \nHe then switched gear to slam \"obstructionist\" Democrat politicians who were blocking his Cabinet nominations and leaking details of private meetings. \n\"I'll tell you what they're obstructionists,\" he said. \"I go to a meeting with them that's supposed to be a very quiet meeting.\" \n\"Nobody talking outside of the meeting. They leave the meeting and they have a news conference about what I said,\" he added, referring to his leaked remarks at a gathering with congressional leaders that he believed that illegal votes by immigrants lost him the popular vote in the election. \n\"They're talking to the cameras about exactly what I said at the meeting, which is fine because I say things that I don't mind going out, because I assume they're going to do that. \n\"But the deal was, we wouldn't talk to the press. And they go out and they talk to the press,\" he added. Piers Morgan blasts Madonna and ‘rabid feminists’ at ‘vacuous’ Women's March on Good Morning Britain \nHe said the delays in the confirmation process was \"not fair\" and insisted that building up the US military was more important to him than balancing the budget. \n\"I want a balanced budget eventually,\" he said. \"But I want to have a strong military. To me that's much more important than anything. \n\"We have a military that's really depleted. And I'm negotiating the price of airplanes, can you believe this? But I understand airplanes. I've bought a lot of airplanes.\" \nContinuing his outspoken criticism of the coverage of the \"very hostile\" and \"very angry\" media, he said he was outraged by an erroneous report that he’d removed a bust of Martin Luther King from the Oval Office. \nIt turned out that the bust hadn’t been removed and the Time reporter apologised, but Mr Trump said: \"That's a very serious charge. Because they're not saying the bust was taken out. \n\"What they're saying is that I'm a racist. That's what they're saying. That's a very serious charge. Then it turned out the bust, in fact I got very angry with my people. I said who took that bust out? Because I wasn't there. \n'And they said it was never moved. It was in the same exact spot it was never moved. I said, how could they say it? These are lying people. These are bad people.\" \nMr Trump said he was an \"environmentalist\" but that wasn’t going to stop him building. \n\"They use the environment to stop a lot of good things, not only energy, buildings and factories, plants,' he said of his predecessors. \n\"They use it to stop things. It's like a roadblock, but that's not going to happen anymore. And the by the way, I'm an environmentalist, okay? \n\"I believe strongly in the environment and I'm going to protect the environment. But you don't have to have a man who wants to build a factory or a person or company wait ten years going through approvals, at the end of the tenth year, get rejected.\" \nOn foreign policy, he claimed it was beneficial for the US to have a better relationship with Russia to \"knock the hell out of Isis \".
