This is the company's largest humanitarian campaign to date.\nThe fund is for four organisations: the ACLU, Immigrant Resource Center, International Rescue Committee and Mercy Corps. Several other Google executives have also individually donated to ACLU and other organizations, though they haven't been identified in the report.\nThe move comes after Google CEO Sundar Pichai strongly objected Trump’s immigration ban in an internal memo. Co-founder Sergey Brin also participated in a protest at San Francisco International Airport over the weekend, although in personal capacity.\nFor generations, this country has been home to immigrants like Sanaz.

The ACLU challenged the executive order and won an emergency stay last week.\nUpdate: the @ACLU just ran the numbers again. Spokesman says the group received 356,306 online donations totaling $24,164,691 this weekend.\n— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 30, 2017\nAs of early a few hours ago, ACLU said it had received over 350,000 online donations, totalling over $24 million over the weekend, in what is more than its five years' worth of online giving.\nRide-sharing service Lyft has also pledged to donate $1 million to ACLU. \"We stand firmly against these actions, and will not be silent on issues that threaten the values of our community,\" the company, which counts billionaire and member of the executive committee of Donald Trump's transition team as one of its investors.\nAstonishing Lyft surge continues; it just moved to Number 9 on US iPhone download chart.
