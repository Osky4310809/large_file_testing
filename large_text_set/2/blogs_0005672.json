Rick opened an abandoned Cañon City storage shed that he had just bought for about $50 and discovered an ax, a blood-stained rope and bloody socks inside a manila envelope marked “Evidence.” “We have lived under 10 years of (expletive) because he was the scapegoat. We’ve been waiting for this break,” Hiltz said. “It became clearer and clearer that this was a police cover up and we have been living a nightmare.”\nThe December discovery of evidence from Candace Hiltz’s murder case in a storage unit rented by sheriff’s Lt. Detective Robert Dodd infuriated Delores Hiltz, and she refuses to remain silent about her daughter’s death.\nKatie Wood, The Denver Post The storage units where evidence from a 10-year-old murder case was found in Canyon City, Colorado on Jan. 19, 2017. Seventeen-year-old Candace Hiltz was murdered in her home in Fremont County on Aug. 15, 2006. No one was ever arrested or charged for her murder but a Canon City man discovered evidence from her case in a storage unit he purchased the contents to at an auction. The unit had previously been rented out by Fremont County Sheriff’s Office Lt. Det. Robert Dodd. The “theft” and hoarding of evidence — including bloody clothing, an ax and a blood-stained rope — in 17-year-old Candace Hiltz’s murder case is so telling, her mother said, that she no longer fears her son will be framed. Hiltz now points an accusatory finger back at the sheriff’s office, saying that at the least they bungled the case. She comes just short of accusing deputies of being involved in her daughter’s death.\nRelated Articles January 15, 2017 2006 murder evidence found in Fremont County Sheriff’s Office storage unit January 17, 2017 Fremont County detective placed on leave after 2006 murder evidence found in his storage unit “( Dodd) had to steal the evidence from the basement of the sheriff’s office. He did that either to protect himself or someone else,” Hiltz said.\nThe 11-page autopsy report, released publicly for the first time at The Denver Post’s request, appears to support Hiltz’s assertion that at least two people and possibly three were involved in her daughter’s murder. She said Fremont County authorities have known for 10 years that multiple people were likely involved, but they still call her son a suspect, knowing that he lived in the woods because of his severe phobia of people.\nSheriff Jim Beicker did not return several phone messages seeking comment, but he has previously said Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents are reviewing the circumstances of the misplaced murder evidence. CBI spokeswoman Susan Medina also declined to comment.\nThe evidence was discovered after Dodd fell behind on his rental fees for a storage unit at Dawson Ranch Mini Storage, which is west of Cañon City. The owner said he auctioned the contents after Dodd paid him with a bad check.\nCourtesy of Kathleen Paiva Candace Hiltz poses with her cousin Kathleen Paiva. Paiva said that Hiltz was 13 years old in the picture. Ratzlaff, a former street racer who has had his run-ins with Beicker and his deputies for years, bought Dodd’s belongings inside the storage shed for about $50 at a Dec. 17 auction.\nWhen Ratzlaff later entered the storage unit, he picked through furniture and toys before he saw unusual items including a stack of about 15 blue-and-red emergency lights taken from squad cars. He also found brown sheriff’s deputy uniforms, some with Dodd’s name tag, and boxes of court documents.\nHe got suspicious when he saw large envelopes with “Evidence” printed on them. One contained a rope with a red stain on it. Another envelope contained socks that appeared saturated with blood.\nWord spread slowly from Ratzlaff, to a Cañon City police officer, to Dodd about the items. Dodd’s family called Ratzlaff and tried to buy the items back, but Ratzlaff declined, he said. When Beicker heard about the find, he met Ratzlaff at the unit.\nThe sheriff warned Ratzlaff that his life could be in danger, Ratzlaff said. While he was looking around the shed, Beicker pointed to a backpack and said it was linked to the case. The sheriff refused to touch the green backpack, but asked Ratzlaff to pick it up and look inside. It held Candace Hiltz’s blood-stained shirt, Ratzlaff said.\nThe evidence now is in the hands of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.\nThe discovery reinforced Hiltz’s misgivings about the deputies involved in the investigation from the start, she said.\nOn Aug. 10, 2006, a deputy drove to Hiltz’s Copper Gulch home and questioned her about her son James, a trespassing suspect. Candace Hiltz, who stood near her mother during the conversation, became increasingly upset at the tone of the deputy’s inquiry and ended up shouting at him. When he threatened to arrest her, Candace Hiltz held out her wrists and told the deputy she had seen him accepting envelopes from known drug dealers. Livid, the deputy stormed out of the house.\nThat was “Candy Girl,” Hiltz said, using her daughter’s nickname. “She had a ton of spunk.”\nThough she was a teen mother, Candace Hiltz was about to graduate from Brigham Young University through an online program. She hoped to enroll at Stanford Law School and dreamed of one day becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice, Hiltz said.\nCourtesy of Kathleen Paiva via Daily Record Candace Hiltz. Three days after the verbal confrontation, the Hiltz family discovered their dog’s body in the woods behind their house. He had been tied to a tree with the blood-stained rope and killed with an ax. Both items were later found in Dodd’s storage unit.\nTwo days later, on Aug. 15, 2006, Delores Hiltz left at noon to run errands. When she returned home at 3:30 p.m., she found blood spatter and pooled blood “all over” the house. But she couldn’t find her daughter, who had stayed home to care for Paige, her 11-month-old daughter.\nHiltz heard her granddaughter screaming and ultimately found her daughter stuffed under a bed, wrapped in a green quilt. About 75 percent of her head was gone. “I held her hand,” Hiltz said.\nIn the days and weeks that followed, Hiltz became increasingly worried about the direction of the investigation. Detectives appeared to be focused on her son, James, repeatedly asking who he had been hanging out with.\nHiltz explained the paranoia that forced her son in and out of the Colorado Mental Health Institute. He was terrified of being with his sister and eight brothers, let alone being with anyone else, Hiltz said. When asked who her son’s buddies were, Hiltz said: “No one. It’s impossible.”\nAn autopsy and blood spatter in the home revealed that Candace Hiltz had been shot almost simultaneously from the front and back.\nOne shotgun shell struck her on the bridge of her nose and exited the back of her head. Five small-caliber bullets struck her in the back of the head. A medium-caliber bullet apparently from a third weapon struck her heart.\nThe sheriff’s officers have long considered James Hiltz a suspect in the case, even though he doesn’t own a gun and investigators found no evidence tying him to the crime, Hiltz said. Two years later, James Hiltz was found not guilty by reason of insanity in an unrelated burglary and sent to the state hospital.\n“How could one man shoot at the same time from two different directions? How could a totally broken man not leave any evidence?” Hiltz asked.\nIn the days after her daughter was killed, Hiltz said she became increasingly frustrated with sheriff’s office missteps. Officers failed to protect the crime scene by putting up crime tape, and investigators left the door open.\nAfter the sheriff’s office finished processing the scene, Hiltz found a shotgun shell in her granddaughter’s crib, bullet shells near the fireplace and the blood-drenched quilt her daughter had been wrapped in. A computer monitor stained with her daughter’s blood and used to prop the bed up was left behind. Towels apparently handled by a suspect also were left, and family members found a bloody shirt that Candace had been wearing near the house.\nHiltz and one of her sons bought a Rubbermaid container, placed all the evidence inside and took the items to the sheriff’s office.\nOver the years, prosecutors and Beicker have attended James Hiltz’s progress hearings and argued against his release from the mental hospital, saying he is a suspect in his sister’s death, Hiltz said.\nNow Hiltz hopes CBI investigators will retest all the evidence and consider other possible suspects.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:47:55.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
