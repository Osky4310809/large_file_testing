Sometimes, adults need to push aside thoughts of failure and the realities of a world that allowed Donald Trump to become President and remember what it’s like to be a child with a view that anything is possible. It sounds like that’s exactly what Blake Lively’s parents did when she was growing up. On Wednesday, the Shallows actress appeared at the L’Oreál Women of Worth gala and spoke on CTV’s eTalk revealed her mother’s advice about self-belief. “Whatever it was, whether I was doing a school project, I was doing something creative, she would always say, ‘You can’t mess it up’,” she said. “I mean, I could mess it up really severely, but just the fact that she told me I couldn’t almost made me feel like I couldn’t.” The 29-year-old, who earlier this week was spotted walking through the streets of New York with her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, said it’s thanks to her mother’s positivity that she was able to try out a career as an actress. “I took risks and I would do things I otherwise would have limited myself with,” she explained. The actress has spoken out about the need for parents to teach children about realistic beauty standards and shedding the idea of perfection in the past, and took the opportunity to address the issue again ahead of the gala, specifically on the subject of positivity on social media. She told eTalk : “I do think we all believe in the same thing, which is everybody wants happiness, everybody wants peace, everybody wants to feel safe and secure.” \n  www.elle.com .
