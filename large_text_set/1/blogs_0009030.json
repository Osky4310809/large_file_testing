In their alternate Huskies uniforms , the Raptors put together a fourth quarter comeback to lift themselves over the Celtics, 114-106, in Toronto.\nDeMar DeRozan was there for the Raptors when they needed him, scoring a season high 41 points while grabbing 13 rebounds to go with it. After blowing fourth quarter leads in back to back games, the Raptors were the ones making a late game comeback this time. Trailing by nine points with six minutes remaining, DeRozan took over and never looked back. He was virtually unstoppable and the Celtics had no answers.\nJonas Valanciunas had quite a night of his own, grabbing a career high 23 rebounds with 10 of those coming in the fourth quarter. Valaciunas was as every bit important to the Raptors win as DeRozan was, who also had 18 points and two blocks on the night.\nJames Harden had another 40-point triple double James Harden finished the night with 40 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists and became the fourth player in NBA history to post back-to-back, 40-point triple doubles. The Rockets are now 10-1 when James Harden scores a triple double and currently riding a nine-game winning streak.\nWe had a Rajon Rondo sighting After five straight DNP-Coach’s Decision games, including his own bobblehead night , Rajon Rondo finally got playing time Tuesday night. The Bulls were without Dwyane Wade , Jimmy Butler , and Nikola Mirotic which most likely explains why Rondo was back in the rotation but he made the most of it. Immediately upon Rondo entering the game, the Bulls went on a 14-0 run against the Wizards . The Wizards won, 101-99, on a late game shot from John Wall but the effort from the Bulls was impressive. Rondo finished the night with 12 points, six assists, four rebounds, and three steals.\nDunk of the night James Johnson dunked ALL OVER Steph Curry\nScores: Wizards 101, Bulls 99 ( Bullets Forever recap | Blog a Bull recap )\nRaptors 114, Celtics 106 ( Raptors HQ recap | Celtics Blog recap )\nHawks 117, Nets 97 ( Peachtree Hoops recap | Nets Daily recap )\nRockets 121, Hornets 114 ( The Dreamshake recap | At the Hive recap )\nBucks 109, Spurs 107 ( Brew Hoop recap | Pounding the Rock recap )\nJazz 100, Cavs 92 ( SLC Dunk recap | Fear the Sword recap )\nKings 100, Pistons 94 ( Sactown Royalty recap | Detroit Bad Boys recap )\nWarriors 107, Heat 95 ( Golden State of Mind recap | Hot Hot Hoops recap )\nTrail Blazers 108, Lakers 87 ( Blazer’s Edge recap | Silver Screen & Roll recap )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T15:40:08.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
