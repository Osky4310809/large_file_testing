shut, will we see Wayne Rooney or Ashley Young head to China in June? \nAfter a transfer window that saw Chinese clubs spend around €388 million on new recruits, the serious business of the 2017 Chinese Super League (CSL) season begins on Friday evening when Guizhou Zhicheng host Liaoning Whowin ahead of a full slate of games over the weekend. \nGuangzhou Evergrande kick off the defence of their sixth straight title against Beijing Guoan on Sunday, while a day before big-spending Shanghai SIPG host Changchun Yatai and Carlos Tevez makes his bow for Shanghai Shenhua against last season's runners up, Jiangsu Suning. \nESPN FC takes a look at all 16 teams ahead of the biggest season even in CSL history. Guangzhou Evergrande are big favourites for another title. Guangzhou Evergrande \nHead coach: Luiz Felipe Scolari (Brazil) Key signing: Kim Hyung-Il (South Korea) Key Player: Zheng Zhi \nGuangzhou Evergrande claimed a record-extending sixth title in a row last season and Luiz Felipe Scolari has made few changes to the all-conquering squad that claimed the league and cup double. Continuity will be the key, with last season's leading scorer Ricardo Goulart still at the club, as the team from southern China aim to continue their dominance. Jiangsu Suning \nHead coach: Choi Yong-Soo (South Korea) Key signing: Yang Boyu Key Player: Alex Teixeira (Brazil) \nChoi Yong-Soo joined Jiangsu Suning after a successful run at FC Seoul midway through last season as the long-term replacement for Dan Petrescu and the South Korean has done little to alter the make-up of his squad after finishing runners-up to Guangzhou Evergrande in both the league and the Chinese FA Cup. After going so close, Jiangsu will be hoping to go one step further in one of the competitions this season. Shanghai SIPG \nHead coach: Andre Villas-Boas (Portugal) Key signing: Oscar (Brazil) Key Player: Hulk (Brazil) \nA third place finish was not enough to keep Sven-Goran Eriksson in his job at the end of last season with the Swede making way for Andre Villas-Boas, who was handed big-money purchase Oscar to boost his already talented squad. A total outlay over the last 15 months of almost €140m means a trophy is expected by the club's hierarchy at the end of the season. Carlos Tevez has arrived in China this season. Shanghai Shenhua \nHead coach: Gustavo Poyet (Uruguay) Key signing: Carlos Tevez (Argentina) Key Player: Giovanni Moreno (Colombia) \nWhile Carlos Tevez's signing captured the headlines and Gustavo Poyet has taken the flak after Shanghai Shenhua missed out on the group stages of the Asian Champions League, the club has recruited poorly -- with no domestic players of note joining the club -- and the pressure will be on a weak squad to match last season's fourth place finish. Beijing Guoan \nHead coach: Jose Gonzalez (Spain) Key signing: Jonathan Soriano (Spain) Key Player: Zhang Xizhe \nBeijing Guoan's new owners went back to go forward: hiring Jose Gonzalez to take over as the Spaniard returned to the club where he had previously served as Gregorio Manzano's assistant. Jonathan Soriano has been signed to score goals on the recommendation of former striker Freddie Kanoute, while veteran defender Xu Yunlong has retired. Guangzhou R&F \nHead coach: Dragan Stojkovic (Serbia) Key signing: Junior Urso (Brazil) Key Player: Eran Zahavi (Israel) \nEran Zahavi was one of the players of last season in the Chinese Super league and Dragan Stojkovic will be looking to the Israeli to deliver once again as Guangzhou R&F attempt to step out of their neighbours' shadow and challenge for a place in the Asian Champions League. Hebei China Fortune \nHead coach: Manuel Pellegrini (Chile) Key signing: Zhang Chengdong Key Player: Ezequiel Lavezzi (Argentina) \nPerhaps the savviest club in the transfer market, Hebei China Fortune brought in seven players with China national team experience as part of an overhaul worth around $100m. The most eye-catching was central defender Zhang Chengdong, who returned to China after a season in Spain for a record transfer fee. Manuel Pellegrini's squad -- also featuring Ezequiel Lavezzi, Hernanes and Stephane Mbia -- should be a serious threat in the battle for the title. Manuel Pellegrini will hope for a successful first season. Chongqing Lifan \nHead coach: Chang Woe-Ryong (South Korea) Key signing: Hyuri (Brazil) Key Player: Alan Kardec (Brazil) \nChongqing Lifan consolidated their position in the CSL with an eighth-place finish last season, their second in a row in that position since sealing a return to the top flight at the end of 2014. Vastly experienced South Korean coach Chang Woe-Ryong has added Hyuri to his squad, with the Brazilian returning to China after an earlier stint with Guizhou Renhe. Yanbian Funde \nHead coach: Park Tae-Ha (South Korea) Key signing: Richard Guzmics (Hungary) Key Player: Bubacarr Trawally (Gambia) \nA disappointing start to last season saw Yanbian Funde sit in 15th place after seven rounds of matches, South Korean coach Park Tae-Ha did well to keep the club in the top flight following their promotion from China League One. The year will be another demanding one for the club given the minimal investment made in the squad compared to others in the division. Tianjin Teda \nHead coach: Jaime Pacheco (Portugal) Key signing: John Obi Mikel (Nigeria) Key Player: Cao Yang \nFormer Beijing Guoan coach Jaime Pacheco starts his first full season at the helm of Tianjin Teda leading a squad that has undergone a significant overhaul during the transfer window, with John Obi Mikel joining from Chelsea as well as former West Bromich Albion forward Brown Ideye. Key to the season will be ensuring they finish above newly promoted local rivals Tianjin Quanjian.
