I have never been there, but I’ve heard many stories about how amazing it is,” Isabella Roll (freshman – education) said. “I’m also looking forward to getting closer with everyone in the group and performing with them, especially the seniors.” \nThe Singing Lions were founded in 1980 and have been a part of Penn State for 37 years. The group has an annual cabaret honoring their THON Child along with performing spring and winter concerts. \n“My favorite song to perform in general is a song called ‘We Sing.’ This song is always dedicated to our two THON children, one who has unfortunately passed away, and one who is still fighting cancer,” Zachary Townsend, vice president of the Singing Lions, said. “The lyrics resonate with the group of why we sing and perform.” \nThe group performs a variety of songs including music from Broadway, current hits on the radio, themed medleys and songs that promote Penn State pride. The Singing Lions not only sing, but also perform choreographed dances to go along with their music. \n“When it comes to deciding songs I give full control to our music director and choreographer because they know what we sound and look best with,” Danielle Renner, president, said. \nThe spring tour consists of about 10 days traveling and performing. At every stop the group reaches out to the Alumni in the area to perform for them and interact. \n“Sometimes, the alumni group houses some of our members for the night, and we are able to talk with them and hear stories of Penn State when they attended,” Townsend (senior-economics) said. “It is always interesting to hear their stories of campus life, and it is refreshing to see their successes as a Penn State graduate.” \nThe Singing Lions includes 20 performers from a variety of different major and years. They come together and showcase, what seems to be, a close-nit community. \n“This group is my family. I only want the absolute best for each and every member,” Renner (senior – journalism) said. “That passion drove me to doing everything in my power to ensure we had a life changing year.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:30:27.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
