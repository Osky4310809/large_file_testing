Tube strike: Londoners are warned to expect severe delays (Jeremy Selwyn) \nA statement on the TfL website has requested London commuters to “please be patient with the transport staff who are at work and trying to help customers get around” during the walk-out. \n“If you are able to change your travel time, you are strongly advised to travel outside peak hours,” the statement adds. “Please allow more time for your journey.” \nFor those not lucky enough to be able to work from home during the strike, here is everything you need to know about planning your journey. \nTube: \nThere will be a limited service running on the District, Circle and Hammersmith & City lines – however trains will not stop at all stations. \nIf you are travelling to or from Heathrow airport , there will be Piccadilly line services running between Hammersmith and Heathrow terminals 1, 2 and 3. Industrial action: There will be limited services running on some Tube lines (Rex) \nTfL has also arranged shuttle services from the end of Tube lines which will run from 7am to 7pm. \nPrinted Tube tickets will be accepted on bus and tram services on \"reasonable alternative routes\" but delay refunds are suspended during the strikes. \nDLR and London Overground: \nFor those working in Canary Wharf, the Docklands Light Railway services will be running from Central London. \nBut some trains travelling towards Central London may be forced to terminate earlier than Bank if it is not possible to open the station. London Underground: All Zone 1 services within the Central line will be closed (Tolga Akmen/LNP/Rex) \nAnd transport bosses have warned that services are likely to be busier than usual, especially at peak travel times in the morning and evening. \nMost London Overground services are expected to operate normally but will also be busier than usual as people opt for different routes to work. \nCustomers have been advised it may be better to walk part of their journey. \nRail: \nTfL rail and National Rail services are not expected to be affected by the strike action, but there will be no London Underground service calling at mainline stations in central London. \nIt may be necessary to walk or take the bus for the final leg of journeys to work. \nBefore 7am and after 7pm on Monday Great Northern Rail services to Moorgate will be diverted to Kings Cross and will not call at Drayton Park, Highbury, Essex Road, Old Street or Moorgate. Rail services: There will be no underground from mainline rail stations (Jeremy Selwyn) \nFrom 7am to 7pm all trains will travel to Old Street, where they will terminate, and will not call at Moorgate \nAnd as a result of on-going - but unrelated – disputes at Southern Rail, train services will also be severely disrupted on Tuesday 10, Wednesday 11 and Friday 13 January. \nNational Rail tickets valid for cross-London travel will be accepted on buses and day Travelcards bought in advance for travel can be returned before the day of travel for a full refund \nBuses and coaches: \nTfL is providing an additional 150 buses on certain routes throughout Sunday evening and Monday. \nBut buses are expected to be very busy and passengers are warned they may be forced to wait for some time to board a bus. Travel disruption: Customers waiting to board a bus (Alex Lentati) \nSeveral coach operators will run more regularly on Monday, with National Express and Green Line services operating routes through key London locations. \nThe roads are expected to be more congested than usual so passengers are advised to allow longer time for journeys. \nCycle: \nThere will be extra ‘Boris bikes’ available to hire at temporary Santander Cycle Hire hubs in Soho Square and Newgate Street. \nInformation on the TfL site said it “will aim to fill existing hubs to capacity at Waterloo Station and Belgrove Street”. Alternative travel: There will be extra bikes available to hire (Rex) \nCycle Hire staff will also be at each hub to assist customers. \nRiver Services: \nRiver Buses will be running as normal, linking central London to Canary Warf, Putney and North Greenwich. \nOyster pay-as-you-go and Contactless are accepted on MBNA Thames Clippers River Buses but tickets must be purchased in advance for ferries and River Tour services. \nEmirates Air Line: \nDuring the strike, the Emirates Air Line will stay open until 11:30pm on Sunday January 8 and will open early – at 6:30 – on Monday. Emirates skyline: The line will stay open later to help customers \nIt will be accepting all valid tickets for travel from 6pm on Sunday for Jubilee line customers travelling to or from the Peninsula. \nTravelling to the airport? \nIf you are travelling Heathrow airport, Piccadilly line services will be running to Terminals 1,2 and 3 from Hammersmith. \nCoach services will run to Heathrow Central Bus Station and Terminals 4 and 5, and national rail services from Paddington will still be operating. \nTo plan your journey or for more information visit the TfL site.
