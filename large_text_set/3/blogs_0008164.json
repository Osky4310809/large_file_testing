Hot on the heels of its S’Well x Lilly Pulitzer floral-printed water bottles (which is being resold on eBay for hundreds ), the coffee giant is releasing for the first time EVER their line of springtime cups! \nThe bright new cups come in three of Pantone’s hottest colors of the moment : primrose yellow for venti sized cups, island paradise blue for grande, and its color of the year, greenery , for tall. \nThe cups also include adorable hand-drawn designs of an Easter bunny, a girl, an umbrella, and a sun. Your coffee break just got a whole lot sunnier. \nWhile the brand has launched different (and sometimes controversial ) cups for its holiday, autumn, and summer seasons, this new line will be the very first to pay homage to spring. \nYou’ll have to be quick to get your hands on one, though: The brand is offering them up for “just a few days,” so run, don’t walk on March 16 when these cups drop! \nWhat do you think of Starbucks’ new look?
