Photograph: PA View more sharing options Monday 20 March 2017 17.18 GMT Last modified on Monday 20 March 2017 17.20 GMT \nMobile phone company Three appears to have suffered a fresh data breach after some customers logging into their accounts were presented with the names, addresses, phone numbers and call histories of complete strangers. \nOne customer, Andy Fidler, told the Guardian he was presented with the data usage and full call and text history of another named customer when he logged in on Sunday night. Another, Mark Thompson, said on Facebook he received a call from a complete stranger who said she had logged on to her account and was shown his details. Data on over 130,000 Three mobile customers compromised in breach Read more \nThompson said it was a “shocking breach of data privacy”. He wrote on Three UK’s Facebook page: “Care to explain just how my details have been shared, how many people have had access to my personal information, for how long, and how many of your other customers have had their details leaked by yourselves to other members of the public as well?” \nOther customers also wanted to know why they were being presented with other people’s information when they logged in. \nThree UK, which is owned by the telecoms giant Hutchinson and has 9 million customers in Britain, said it was investigating what had happened. \nThe problem comes four months after three men were arrested after fraudsters accessed personal data of thousands of Three customers, including names and addresses, by using authorised logins to its database of customers eligible for an upgraded handset. Customer information from more than 133,000 users was compromised in the incident. \nFidler said he was alerted to the problem at the weekend when he couldn’t access the Three app on his phone, and so logged on through the company’s website. When the account details came up, they were not his. \n“I managed to successfully download a complete stranger’s phone bill,” he said. “All I did was click on the link to bring up my bill. It included the name, address, how much they were paying, the phone numbers they had rung and texted.” He said bank details were not available. \nFidler said the problem was incredibly worrying and he had called Three immediately to alert the company. \nThe call handler originally told him to delete the bill, but then called back with more detailed instructions including not to “touch my account for a couple of days until they have looked into it”. \nFidler said he was concerned he might have been paying someone else’s bill. “Who on earth has got my bill?” he said.
