Long Story \nSo, how's March Madness going? Was it fun getting up to grab a beer from the fridge only to miss the big bucket? How about that moment when your phone died 'cause you were checking your bracket every five minutes (in disbelief)? Yeah, crappy, huh? Well, that's because you've been using a coffee table from the stone age rather than living in 2017. \nBut don't worry, this coffee table will take your home theater to another level. It's got a beer fridge to keep your tall boys nice and chilly. It's got a Bluetooth speaker you can hook up to the TV, or bump some tunes while you watch.

As a matter of fact, it might be the most American thing ever. Pioneers to the United States had bread and meat, but it took the American way of thinking to create the hamburger. Combos are key folks. \nSo yes, you might have all those features nearby, but do you have them all in one coffee table? No, you don't, not unless you've got a Sobro, bro. \nIf you want one, it's available on Indiegogo and right now it's still offering an early bird price of $499 + shipping.   \nHow have we been watching sports Drop This Fact \nA couple of years ago a company unveiled a $7,000 coffee table with a tablet built in .
