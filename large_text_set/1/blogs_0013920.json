to have courage for oneself and for others; to challenge old structures and advance society and our way of life: that’s the most difficult task in the world, because it confronts the beliefs of predecessors and decision-makers,’ explains vincent callebaut . ‘our proposal for tour & taxis attempts to turn this ambition into a reality — step by step.’ \nthe ‘gare maritime’ is transformed into 50,000 sqm of office, retail, and public amenities \nthe concept brings a public park inside the building \nthe original building is decorated like an art nouveau masterpiece \nan eco-campus is created, replete with vegetation and water \neach of the five naves seek to enhance the building’s industrial heritage with a distinct interior \nthe contents of each volume remain completely detached from the historic structure \nimage courtesy of vincent callebaut architectures image courtesy of vincent callebaut architectures image courtesy of vincent callebaut architectures image courtesy of vincent callebaut architectures image courtesy of vincent callebaut architectures image courtesy of vincent callebaut architectures image courtesy of vincent callebaut architectures image courtesy of vincent callebaut architectures", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T15:25:55.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
