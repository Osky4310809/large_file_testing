In the convo, Bria questions her dad about his Coming To America tweet, and it’s clear that the actor is fully unaware of any Twitter account. \n“Twitter account? What Twitter account? I have a Twitter account?” Murphy texts in response to his daughter’s inquiry. A post shared by Bria Murphy (@bria_murphy) on Mar 16, 2017 at 11:00pm PDT \nAdditionally, a search of the @eddiemurphy Twitter account now yields a “Sorry, that page doesn’t exist!” error message. \nTMZ did report that Murphy’s page is run by a social media team, and the tweet/account may have been deleted because someone jumped the gun on the Coming To America sequel news. \nEddie Murphy has yet to comment publicly on the matter.
