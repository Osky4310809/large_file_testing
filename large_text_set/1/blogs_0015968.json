The New Jersey native has gone to great lengths to show off his passion for his favorite NFL team , and now he’s bringing his friends along for the ride — whether they like it or not. \nTrout made a friendly wager with one of his hometown buddies on the outcome of Sunday’s Cowboys-Packers game. Trout took the Packers, while his friend, DJ Cottrell, took the Cowboys. \nSo naturally, when the Cowboys suffered the devastating loss to the Packers, Cotrell was crushed — for more reasons than one. \nOn Monday, Trout’s buddy had to pay up — by sporting a complete Philadelphia Eagles uniform to the gym. When Dallas let's you down. Gotta wear eagles uniform the entire workout. #FlyEaglesFly @MikeTrout pic.twitter.com/awgVMuTL8D \n— DJ Cottrell (@_CottrellDJ) January 18, 2017 \nAnd it doesn’t sound like he’ll be allowed to take it off anytime soon. The fact I have to wear an entire Eagles uniform to the gym for a week is going to be the death of me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:02:48.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
