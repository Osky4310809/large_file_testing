Alongside campaigns such as The Homeless Period, we can overcome the taboo of talking about menstruation while ensuring sanitary products are reaching those most in need.\n‘Until we know the full extent of this issue in the UK, we would urge other manufacturers to look at how they can further support this cause so that we can keep increasing access to these fundamental products.’\nThey’ll be sending towels to In Kind Direct who’ll then distribute packs through its network of 5,000 charitable organisations around the UK.\n\n‘In Kind Direct distributes everyday essential products to charities across the UK, hundreds of which support women and girls affected by issues such as homelessness, poverty, disability, illness and domestic violence,’ says Robin Boles VO, CEO of In Kind Direct.\n‘This very welcome, long term commitment from Bodyform means we will be able to provide more charities with a consistent supply of sanitary products and help many more women struggling to afford this most basic necessity.’\nMORE: This synchronised swimming group is doing a special performance dedicated to periods \nMORE: Someone’s making a ‘feminine lipstick’ that glues your labia shut to seal in your period ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:27:27.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
