The last movie she did was Gauri Shinde's English Vinglish , in 2012. And it looks like Sridevi is finally coming back to hit the silver screen! \nMom , her upcoming movie which is speculated to be a social drama, is produced by none other than husband Boney Kapoor. That's not all; the film is directed by Ravi Udyawar, and has an incredible supporting cast that includes Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Akshaye Khanna, Abhimanyu Singh, and Vikas Verma. AR Rahman is said to have given the music. \nThe movie is going to be an intense one, as we gather from this poster and Sridevi's stern gaze. The word mother has been written all over in different languages. The film, that is going to be Sridevi's 30th venture as an actor, is slated to be hit the box office on July 14 this year!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T02:46:16.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
