Can you name the 20 Spanish players who have made the most Premier League appearances? \nViewers could practically feel the tension oozing through the TV screen as the footballers locked eyes with steely glares and got ready to out stare each other for the win. \nUntil the sultry tones of Michael Bolton singing How Am I Supposed To Live Without You? blasted through the studio giving the death stare contest a sudden romantic feeling. \nWhile Terry managed to keep his face poker straight and eyes narrowed as the romantic ballad overpowered the moment, poor Lampard began to waver and soon enough had to turn away giggling. \nUnfortunately that meant Terry won as the first person to break eye contact, laugh or smirk was the loser. \nTerry 1, Lampard 0. \n“No, no, no, no, no!” laughed Lampard.

A reply showed Terry laughed first! (Photo: ITV) They're usually the closest of teammates (Photo: Getty Images Sport Classic) \nSo the deciding round began as Holly giggled: “I’ve never seen anything more beautiful in my life!” \nProviding the soundtrack this time was Chris Isaak with Wicked Game, but it was Another Level’s Freaky that had Lampard’s mouth twitching. Point to Terry! \nFinal score: Lampard 1 - 2 Terry. \nGood show, boys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T11:41:01.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
