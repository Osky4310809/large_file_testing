They’re the ones behind everything from Bar Jackalope to Arts District Brewing, and their latest endeavor falls right in line with their Downtown ideals: Give the people what they want.\nIn this case , folks want a casual bar with long hours and inexpensive drinks. Add in some fun and games, plus a light menu of bar snacks, and you’ve got a winner on your hands — particularly at their location. 213 founders Cedd Moses and Eric Needleman partnered up with Eric Alperin and Richard Boccato to bring the place to life, and their combined prowess in creating spaces people actually want to hang out in is basically unrivaled.\nBar Clacson lands right on Broadway in a stretch of Downtown that’s only becoming more activated all the time. The airy room is clean without being off-putting, and already feels worn in without being overused. Add in the 18 tap lines that run anything from craft beer to cider to wine to cocktails, and you’ve got a laid-back recipe for a night out on the town.\nThe Marshall Group and Janel Wright Design collaborated on bringing the place to life. The official opening for Bar Clacson is tonight, and moving forward the plan is to keep hours from 3 p.m. to 2 a.m. Tuesday through Friday, with extended hours on the weekends.\nBar Clacson \n351 S.
