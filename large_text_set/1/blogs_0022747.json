The supreme court is doing MPs’ dirty work for them on article 50 | Simon Jenkins Read more \nAt 9.30am the court’s president, Lord Neuberger, will read out a carefully crafted summary of the decision. Lawyers for the main parties will have been shown the judgment an hour and a half earlier. Close scrutiny of senior barristers’ and solicitors’ expressions as they gather in court may provide a preliminary hint of the judicial outcome. \nThe brief proceedings will be televised. The statement read out by Neuberger is expected to last only five minutes. The full judgment will be put online by the supreme court at about 9.35am. \nThe ruling by the 11 justices will resolve whether the government, through its inherited use of royal prerogative powers, can formally initiate article 50 of the treaty on European Union (TEU) without the explicit approval of MPs and peers. \nArticle 50 begins the process of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. If a majority of justices decide, as is widely expected, that parliamentary support is required, then the judgment could specify that legislation is needed. \nThe panel of 11 justices is the largest ever assembled for a single case since the law lords were created in 1876. Such judicial mass mobilisation is recognition of the constitutional significance and political sensitivity of the hearing. The court normally sits in panels of five – an odd number is always required to ensure there cannot be a tie. \nGiven that there could be separate dissenting and concurring decisions by individual justices, the full document could easily run to more than 100 pages. \nThe lead claimant in the supreme court case is Gina Miller, an investment manager. Miller, who says she has received death threats , argues that her case is about asserting parliamentary sovereignty and not an attempt to reverse Brexit. Another claim was brought by Londoner Deir Dos Santos. \nPopular expectations have been better managed than they were before the government’s surprise high court defeat . Ministers have signalled they expect to lose . \nLast time, the Daily Mail condemned the three high court judges who found against the government, including the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd , as “ enemies of the people ”. \nAny attacks by the media on the independence of the judiciary are expected to be more muted this time. Theresa May has already conceded that parliament will eventually be given a vote on the final shape of any Brexit deal. \nNonetheless, the judgment represents a significant moment in the supreme court’s growing constitutional status. Departure from the EU, which involves extracting the UK from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice in Luxembourg, will further enhance the authority – and workload – of Britain’s most senior judges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:20:47.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
