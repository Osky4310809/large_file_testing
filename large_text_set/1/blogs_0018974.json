PA:Press Association Matip had missed the game at Manchester United and FA Cup tie at Plymouth Plymouth 0-1 Liverpool : Lucas Leiva scores his first goal in seven years \n\"Following FIFA's ruling, the club now considers the player available for selection.\" \nEarlier in the day manager Jurgen Klopp had complained about the situation after Cameroon refused to sanction Matip's release to play for his club, as they consider the player to have rejected their approach to name him in their African Nations Cup squad despite him having not featured since September 2015. \nAsked how tough the uncertainty over the player's availability had made planning for matches, the Reds boss said: \"It is difficult in this position because with the fixtures we have the at the moment we don't have a lot of training time and you have to work with the team which could start in the next game, and when you're not sure what to do with Joel he is not that involved. Reuters 4 Jurgen Klopp was angry a decision took so long and wanted common sense to prevail \n\"I had to put (myself) outside this case a little bit because I need my full concentration on other things. \n\"It is another experience which you don't need but we have to learn from it. \n\"But it is not about the Africa Cup of Nations: I absolutely do not have a problem with the Africa Cup of Nations, it is the opposite. \n\"I have respect for all what they are doing there in the most difficult circumstances still. \n\"It is a great tournament - in the middle of our season makes it not too cool but that is not my decision.\" \nLiverpool have already suffered as a result of the African Nations Cup with the loss of top scorer Sadio Mane. \nThe forward has scored twice in the two group matches so far, meaning Senegal will qualify for the latter stages and Mane will be absent for longer. Getty Images 4 Matip has not played for Cameroon since 2015 and has retired from international football \nWhile the loss of the pacy forward has definitely impacted on Liverpool's attacking options, Klopp admits he is conflicted between what is best for the club and what is best for the player. \n\"'I am happy for you but on the other side I could really kick you in the....lower back',\" added Klopp when asked what he had said to Mane about his progress in the tournament. \n\"They are through, which is good. He played again, scored again. \n\"I texted him last night but mixed emotions is probably the best description. \n\"As long as he is fit then we take it like it is and support Senegal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T19:39:26.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
