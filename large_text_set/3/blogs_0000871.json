Comment IMAGE Chris Clinton \nA large study seeking to find who's having the more orgasms than everyone else confirmed some things we already knew â€” like the fact that heterosexual men are having way more orgasms during sex than heterosexual women. But according to David Frederick , lead author of the 52,000 participant study, the research found some orgasm gaps along sexual orientation lines that researchers had been unable to confirm before. The study, which was performed by a team of researchers from Chapman University and the Kinsey Institute, found (of course) that 95 percent of heterosexual men report orgasming always or almost always during sex. Comparatively, only 65 percent of heterosexual women said they experience the same thing. Here's where the study gets more interesting: Numbers for the same rates of orgasming were 89 percent for gay men, 86 percent for lesbian women, 88 percent for bisexual men, and 66 percent for bisexual women.

But there's hope! Because what researchers also learned is a handy trio of moves that apparently are the most successful at delivering orgasms to women. As reported by the Guardian , a \"golden trio\" of \"genital stimulation, deep kissing, and oral sex\" seriously increased a woman's chances of orgasm. There you have it. If that's a little much for you, researchers were correct in their hypothesis that receiving oral sex alone is a huge indicator of how often someone has orgasms. According to the study , \"people who received oral sex more frequently had orgasms more frequently.\" And this fact comes with an added bonus! The only group who didn't report having more orgasms when they received more oral sex were straight men. Literally all other sexual orientations tracked by this study reported they \"usually-always\" orgasm if they \"usually-always\" receive oral. So in the spirt of \"two birds, one stone,\" and if you're committed to reducing the orgasm gap, demand more oral sex (unless you're a straight dude).
