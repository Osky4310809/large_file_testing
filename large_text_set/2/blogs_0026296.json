The actress showed off what we're calling her most dramatic tress transformation of all time—a gorgeous headful of voluminous ringlets—moments before taking her seat at the star-studded award show . And lucky for us, Berry's hairstylist, Castillo , filled us in on the natural-textured look just minutes before the actress hit the red carpet. \"It's something so different, right?\" Castillo told Allure on the phone mere minutes after perfecting the actress' curly style. \"We wanted to bring out her natural texture, but also make it something that was red carpet-ready. When we were going through different hair trials, we fell in love with the way the organic, effortless, and still very powerful look this gave off. She was still very true to herself.\" You May Also Like Celebrity Oscars 2017: Jessica Biel's Hair Literally Has an Unexpected Twist In total, the curly style took about two hours to create, says Castillo, and it required lots of blow-drying, curling, and a jam sesh to Bruno Mars' new album. To get the look, the hairstylist added a volumizing cream ( MOP C-Curl Defining Cream ) to Berry's damp hair—from midshaft to the ends—to create a little extra lift. From there, Castillo diffused the star's hair using the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i Hair Dryer and the SoftTouch 2 Diffuser . And once Berry's hair was completely dry, Castillo started added in the curls—in all different sizes and textures—using the T3 Twirl Convertible Curling Iron . The finishing touch? The MOP C-System Firm Hair Spray , which the hair pro spritzed throughout the hair to hold the curls and give it that silky, shiny glow.
