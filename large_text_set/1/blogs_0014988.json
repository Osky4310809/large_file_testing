(CBSNewYork) — A woman who was seriously injured in a crash on Long Island Saturday has died, authorities say. \nRosalie Koening, 62, of Mastic, was pumping gas at a Mobil station near William Floyd Parkway and Moriches Middle Island Road at around 11:25 a.m. when police say a woman driving under the influence missed a turn and crashed into a gas pump on the scene. \nKoening was pinned between the gas pump and her Nissan Frontier, police say. She was taken to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center in serious condition and later transferred to Stony Brook University Hospital. \nHer husband now mourns his wife, who succumbed to her injuries during surgery early Sunday morning. \n“I lose my wife,” Margaro Maisonet told CBS2’s Ali Bauman. “I lose my wife, I’m feeling very bad right now. \nRenee McKinney, 53, of Mastic, who was driving the 2002 Nissan Altima that crashed, was taken to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center as a precaution, police say. Passenger Iesha Lemay, 33, of Mastic, was not injured. \nA gas station attendant saw the whole incident and immediately pressed the emergency stop button, turning off all the gas pumps and potentially preventing an explosion. \n“If there was any fire or something it would have been a disaster,” she said. \nThe attendant, who did not wish to be identified or show her face, says the driver of that white Nissan appeared to be under the influence. \n“Her eyes were looking empty and she wasn’t giving a response,” she said. \n1010 WINS’ Carol D’Auria reports that McKinney was overdosing on an opioid at the time of the crash. Police say they administered Narcan before taking her into custody. Ray-Sean Miller was at the gas station when the crash occurred.\n“I went around and saw a lady on the ground, and when she was down on the ground she was still holding the gas nozzle in her hand,” he said. \nMcKinney was arrested and appeared in court on Sunday. She was charged with driving while ability impaired by drugs in the first degree. \nBail is set at $100,000 cash or $300,000 bond. District Attorney Thomas Spota said evidence from the investigation will be presented to a Suffolk County grand jury. Koenig’s widower says his wife was a Jehovah’s Witness who devoted her life to God. In her memory, he finds forgiveness. © 2017 CBS Local Digital Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T02:46:54.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
