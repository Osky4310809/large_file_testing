That just goes to show you how the audiences has grown since the first film, something that usually doesn’t happen with sequels like this.\nAlong with a higher box office, Keanu Reeves also took out even more bad guys this time. The original movie gave John Wick a kill count of 84, as confirmed by co-director David Leitch , but the John Wick 2 kill count increased that by about 50%, proving why you don’t stab the devil in the back. \nHere’s an infographic breaking down all of John Wick’s kills in the sequel (via Visu ):\nThe infographic even goes so far as to break down how John Wick killed him, including the different guns he used.
