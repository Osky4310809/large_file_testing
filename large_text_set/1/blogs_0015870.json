Ford Bronco – Ranger-based, separate from Everest? / 2 comments \nIt appears that while the much-awaited Ford Bronco SUV – which will arrive in the United States in 2020 – will be based on the Ranger , it will be a separate vehicle from the Everest that also shares the pick-up’s roots, according to comments made by Ford’s executive vice president of product planning Raj Nair. \nIn an interview with Autoline Daily , Nair said that the Bronco will be a unique offering from the Everest sold over here, while retaining a body-on-frame construction. “It will be an incremental vehicle from the Everest,” he said. “The Everest serves…in the space the Explorer serves in the US, but with a body-on-frame construction and with a lot more off-road capability for the rest of the world. \n“This Bronco is going to be completely unique from that Everest,” Nair added, while also mentioning that the new SUV will be positioned in size between the original Bronco and the much larger Bronco II – the latter has since been replaced by the F-150-based Expedition . \nNair’s comments run contrary to those made by a user on Reddit claiming to be working on the design of the new US-market Ranger, due in 2019. In his Ask Me Anything (AMA) thread, he claimed that the new Bronco will be essentially be a rebadged Everest, but with certain differences. Unlike the previous Broncos, the new one will also have four doors instead of two. \nMeanwhile, Nair also said that the US-market Ranger will be fundamentally identical to the global model that is sold here, but with a few changes to comply with regulations and buyers’ expectations in America. “[There will be] some changes for US laws, and also some aspects that US customers are looking for.” Research Ford Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T15:37:12.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
