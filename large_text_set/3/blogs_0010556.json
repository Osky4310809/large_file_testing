Parsons \"will likely undergo season-ending surgery,\" according to Tim MacMahon of ESPN.com. \"To suffer a setback like this after working so diligently to rebound from the injury to his right knee is obviously tough,\" general manager Chris Wallace said in the team's statement. \"That said, we know he will continue to work tirelessly to return to the court with his teammates and contribute. Chandler has the full support of myself, Coach Fizz and the entire team, and we are all focused on getting him healthy.\" Parsons has had knee injuries over the past few seasons, and a torn right meniscus in March of last year ended his 2015-16 campaign following a career-low 61 appearances. The start of his tenure with the Grizzlies was marred by more injuries, and a bone bruise on his left knee kept him out from Nov. 19 until Dec. 21 after his debut had been delayed to Nov. 6. Thirty-four appearances into the season, Parsons is averaging just 6.2 points per game on 33.8 percent shooting from the field and 26.9 percent shooting from three-point rangeâ€”all career lows. In July, he inked a four-year, $94.5 million deal to serve as an offensive linchpin for the Grizzlies under first-year head coach David Fizdale. With Parsons banged up once again, Memphis figures to deploy a platoon of wings to compensate for his absence. Look for Vince Carter, James Ennis and Troy Daniels to try to pick up the slack while the 28-year-old is sidelined.
