With his own show, for at least two months, Melber will have a chance to expand the list extensively. \nMelber will have quite a bit to discuss for the premiere episode, as Trump spent 13 minutes attacking the media during his speech at CPAC on Friday and the White House blocked several news organizations from attending a press briefing. \nRead original story Ari Melber Lands Weekly MSNBC Show Through Trump’s First 100 Days (Exclusive) At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.
