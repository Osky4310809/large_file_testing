It’s existential.\nDoes the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta, winner of 12 straight elections, simply follow Kenney’s prescription and vote itself out of existence, or fight on with its own identity?\nThe question was theoretical when Kenney began his run last year, although worrisome enough that some key PC players wanted him rejected at the start.\nThe argument for banning him was quite credible. Leadership candidates are supposed to promote the best interests of the party. Arguably, abolishing the party doesn’t quite meet that standard.\nBut many PCs still believed the membership would spit out Kenney like a bad clam. So they let him run, and were immediately stunned by his organization, money and bloodthirsty will to prevail.\nNow a Kenney victory is stark reality. He’s running away with the race and everybody knows it. One riding after another is picking slates of Kenney delegates for the March convention.\nRelated PC leadership candidate Jason Kenney challenged on all sides over plan to unite Alberta’s conservatives Don Braid: Conspiracy theorists rush to point blame at Jason Kenney after Wildrose office break-in Is Jason Kenney unbeatable? Why some think Tory leadership race in Alberta may already be over And so, an endgame debate about Kenney is raging among the traditional PCs who still dominate the board. The talk hasn’t risen to the level of a formal board meeting, but that could be close.\nEverybody’s still using code, but it doesn’t take much brainpower to decipher comments from interim party leader Ric McIver, who hasn’t declared himself but is clearly in Kenney’s camp.\n“Efforts to look for excuses to disqualify a contestant so some other contestant in the leadership can win are faulty efforts,” he told Postmedia’s James Wood. “If we’re going to be a successful party going forward, we must, must, must let our members decide who the next leader of our party is.”\nKenney’s people are fully expecting a move to oust him. If it happens, they’ll raise hell, prompting a ferocious backlash from tens of thousands of Alberta conservatives who want a united front against the NDP.\nBut some PC board members believe that taking the abuse is preferable to abolition of the party they’ve supported for decades. They hope to hunker down until the storm passes, and rebuild later on their old foundation.\nThat’s not entirely delusional. Many PC voters do not want their party buried by Kenney and his crew of Harper loyalists.\nThis fight goes back nearly 50 years, to Peter Lougheed’s first victory over Social Credit. It played out in split loyalty between federal PCs and the Reform party, in Ralph Klein’s leadership victory over Nancy Betkowski in 1992, in the 2009 split of Wildrose from the PC government.\nBut this conflict is different, and even more emotional, because it doesn’t just involve the leadership of the party. It’s about the very survival of the party. That’s why the PC board might just eject Kenney.\nThe pressures are already cracking the party wide open.\nThe new president of the youth wing, installed by Kenney loyalists, blasts the main governing board for kicking out Kenney campaign organizer Allan Hallman.\nKenneyites in the youth group even thumbed their noses by making Hallman their honorary chair. This is unprecedented — like sea cadets jeering the admiral. \nOn Twitter, some of Kenney’s loyalists come close to calling for the overthrow of the main governing board. That would be one way to keep the board from overthrowing him.\nEjecting Kenney would be complicated. Hundreds of his delegates have already been voted in. Four of eight PC MLAs endorse Kenney. There would be a civil war unlike anything we’ve seen since Wildrose first split off from the PCs.\nBut when the alternative is death, PC traditionalists might just start the war.\nDon Braid’s column appears regularly in the Calgary Herald. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T06:25:30.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
