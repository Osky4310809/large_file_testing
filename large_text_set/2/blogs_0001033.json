It is very likely that you know at least one couple who proudly raises their companion animal as their own — you might even be one of those couples. Unfortunately, relationships don’t last for every couple and when it comes to divorce, animals are treated no differently than a piece of property in the eyes of the law. Well, Alaska has just taken a huge step for the companion animals of divorced couples. In a new law that went into effect in late January, divorce court must now consider which partner is best for the pet. David Favre, an animal law professor at Michigan State University, told The Washington Post “for the first time, a state has specifically said that a companion animal has visibility in a divorce proceeding beyond that of property — that the court may award custody on the basis of what is best for the dog, not the human owners.” \nAlong with the new amendment, Alaska added two other new protections for companion animals . First, guardians are now financially responsible for animals that are seized from them as a result of neglect and abuse. The second is that Alaska courts may now enter domestic violence protective orders for pets , including temporary care and it also adds cruelty to animals as a crime related to domestic violence if the animal is a pet. While Alaska is joining 32 other states who also hold this type of law, it is a huge victory for both humans and pets, as it is common for abusers to use the safety of the pet in order to gain leverage over their partner. Further, 65 percent of survivors of domestic violence have reported staying in the relationship out of fear for their pet’s safety. \nPreviously, the fate of the pet could potentially be left to property laws if the divorcing couple could not make a decision on their own. This signals a major shift in the way that Alaska courts view pets as individuals rather than a piece of property to be argued over. This is a historic moment for pets of Alaskan couples and we hope to see it spark conversations about how the law treats pets in these situations nationwide. This type of law belongs in every state and we have the power to make it happen by mobilizing to take action. Start a petition asking for your state to pass this type of bill, gather signatures, and present it to your legislators to show them that we believe our animals deserve to be treated as more than mere property. \nImage source: absolutimages /Shutterstock Want to read more posts like this?
