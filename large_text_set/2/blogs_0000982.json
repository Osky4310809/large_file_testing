Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) have indicated that they will vote oppose DeVos’ confirmation. \nWithout the support of the two Republicans, the likelihood of DeVos’ confirmation becomes questionable. \nAccording to the Washington Post , both senators have said they admire DeVos’s efforts to help at-risk children through her advocacy for school vouchers and charter schools, they are feel she doesn’t have the experience to lead the Department of Education because she has not worked in public schools, attended them or sent her children to them. \n“I simply cannot support her confirmation,” Collins said during remarks on the Senate floor. \n… \n“I take very personally the success of Alaska’s schools and Alaska schoolchildren,” Murkowski said. “I believe that my colleagues here in the United States Senate and the many, many that they represent have the right to debate these questions.” \nApparently, Collina and Murkowski didn’t get the message on November 8th. \nThe people chose Donald Trump. \nThey trust his vision for the future of the nation. \nTime to get onboard, ladies.
