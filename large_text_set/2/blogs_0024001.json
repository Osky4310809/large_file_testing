Picture: Facebook \nShe would invite the men to meet her at a hotel and then ask them to transfer up to $600 into her account so she could book the room. \nThen she would cancel the date, giving excuses including that her mother had been taken to hospital and had died. \nShe would then ask for money to help pay for the funeral costs or her mortgage repayments, saying her rich grandfather in Egypt would pay them back. \nDerbas would then continue to ask for money, saying she needed to pay transfer fees or taxes before her grandfather’s money would be released. \nWhen police raided her Miller home in Western Sydney, they found three diaries containing 349 mens’ names along with her female aliases including “Sarina Lopez”, “Sarrina” and “Marrisa “. \nPolice also found 15 phones with one containing her text exchanges with 20 other men who were not among victims. \nDerbas told the court she blew the money on cocaine and gambling addictions among other things. \nThe court heard she had multiple plastic surgeries including three liposuctions, Botox, lip fillers, eye fillers and nasal reconstruction, but did not say she spent the ill-gotten money on transforming her body.
