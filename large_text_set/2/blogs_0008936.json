Most importantly, Abel Tesfaye sung the track perfectly and brought just enough stage presence to distract from the fact that his backing band consisted of two static automatons. Check out the full performance below. \nFollow Noisey on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:39:30.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
