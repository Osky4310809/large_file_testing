David Buik (@truemagic68) BT admits true scale of Italian accounting scandal The BT logo. \nTelecoms group BT has just shocked the City by announcing that the accounting scandal at its Italian division is much worse than previously thought. \nThe FTSE-listed company is slashing its revenue, earnings and free cash flow forecasts for this year, and next year. It has also suspended several senior executives from BT Italy who have already left the company. \nAn investigation by KPMG has uncovered that “the extent and complexity of inappropriate behaviour in the Italian business were far greater than previously identified.” \nKPMG found that the division used “improper accounting practices” and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions. \nThis has driven the cost of the scandal up to £530m, sharply higher than the £145m which BT announced in October . \nThis is going to have a serious impact on BT’s business. It is now predicting no revenue growth over the next two years, and cutting its guidance for EBITDA profits from £7.9bn to £7.6bn. \nGavin Patterson, chief executive of BT Group , says: \n“We are deeply disappointed with the improper practices which we have found in our Italian business. \nWe have undertaken extensive investigations into that business and are committed to ensuring the highest standards across the whole of BT for the benefit of our customers, shareholders, employees and all other stakeholders.” \nBT has appointed a new boss of BT Italy. He takes charge on 1 February, and will work on improving the “governance, compliance and financial safeguards in our Italian business”. \nIn short, this is pretty serious. I’ll pull together some reaction now. Updated 07:31 The agenda: A big day for sterling? \nGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. \nInvestors in City have plenty to think about today. At 9.30am, the UK supreme court will rule on whether parliament must give its approval before Britain can begin its departure from the European Union. \nThat news will be liveblogged in another place, but we’ll be watching too as the decision will move the markets. \nOwen Bowcott , our legal affairs correspondent, explains how the ruling will affect the Brexit timetable: \nThe ruling by the 11 justices will resolve whether the government, through its inherited use of royal prerogative powers, can formally initiate article 50 of the treaty on European Union (TEU) without the explicit approval of MPs and peers. \nArticle 50 begins the process of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. If a majority of justices decide, as is widely expected, that parliamentary support is required, then the judgment could specify that legislation is needed.
