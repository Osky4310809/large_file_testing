They showed off several statues from their Batman : Arkham Knight line included a few different versions of Batman himself along with Robin, Batman Beyond, Scarecrow, Two-Face, Harley Quinn, Nightwing, Azrael, Arkham Knight, an armored version of the Batsuit, and Batgirl. \nPrime 1 also showed off a few other additions to their Arkham Origins line, including Deathstroke, Joker, Killer Croc, and a truly stunning Mr. Freeze (that base is phenomenal). There's also a Batman variant with Bruce holding a sword that is really something to behold. \nIf you prefer the comic styling, the comic Justice League line is based on the New 52 artwork of Jim Lee, and so far features Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash, and Darkseid. If you prefer the cinematic versions Prime 1 is also offering a Justice League (sporting a 4.35 out of 5 on ComicBook.com's anticipation rankings ) film based Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman for sale. \nYou can find more information about Prime 1 Studio on their official Facebook page , but here are a few of the stellar highlights. \nIn Justice League , fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. \nJustice League is directed by Zack Snyder, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio, and features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Ciarán Hinds, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Jeremy Irons and Jesse Eisenberg. \nJustice League hits theaters on November 17, 2017.
