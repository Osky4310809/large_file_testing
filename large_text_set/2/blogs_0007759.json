Speaking to Spanish newspaper El Mundo (h/t Goal's Dejan Kalinic ), Nadal, 30, opened up on his intention to one day lead the club he's supported since he was a boy. \"If you ask me if I would like it, of course I would, why not?,\" Nadal said. \"But there is more to it...I think it will not be. \"We are very good as we are. We have a great president right now, and I don't think Real Madrid need me, but we never know what can happen in the future. \"It is not something I can raise today.\" Nadal's uncle, Miguel, played for Real's bitter rivals Barcelona during his days as a professional footballer, as well as Mallorca and Manacor in the Balearic Islands, where the 14-time Grand Slam champion was born. El Mundo (h/t AS ) recently named Nadal the second-richest sportsman in Spain, behind only Formula One driver Fernando Alonso, which would only help his candidacy. A move to appoint Nadal as president would represent a change in dynamic for Real Madrid, whose current servant in the role, Perez, was a politician before succeeding in his second attempt to take the presidency in 2000. This isn't the first time Los Blancos have crossed paths with Nadal. In March 2016, Real released a statement defending the tennis star, who at the time had fallen under allegations of doping related to an injury absence in 2012. \"Real Madrid C.F. would like to express their full support to our honorary member, Rafa Nadal, undoubtedly one of the greatest sportsmen of all time in Spain and in the world. \"Rafa Nadal represents the fundamental values of sport. His greatness and his incredible achievements have always been based upon a foundation of exemplary conduct, unwavering work, talent and astonishing levels of commitment. ... \"... Real Madrid C.F. consider the close ties to an idol such as Nadal to be an honour, such is his status as a symbol sporting excellence. Nadal is admired and adored by millions of fans the world over, and today our club is standing firmly by his side.\" The La Liga leaders may well consider Nadal as a candidate for the role if he ever wished to run. What's more, many Real fans would likely flock to support Nadal in the event they required a new leader, meaning the sporting icon's dream may not be as impossible as many might suppose.
