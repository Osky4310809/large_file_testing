When you’re from a famously white state that routinely votes Republican and you’re auditioning to lead the Democratic Party, you’d better go the extra mile in reassuring the party’s minority voters that they can trust you. Remember, this is a woman who’s competing with a former Nation of Islam member for the job. There had better be some serious self-flagellation to impress the audience. \nBlack lives matter and it makes me sad that we’re even having that conversation and that tells me that white leaders in our party have failed. We have to accept there is prejudice that exists within our own party and we have to be able to have these conversations. We cannot sweep that under the rug. We cannot continue to hide it. We cannot smash voices down when they are trying to scream, “Listen to me, you don’t get it.”\nI’m a white woman. I don’t get it. I am pleased and honored to be here today to have the conversation. I am so excited that we’re here. And I am listening. Because that’s my job. My job is to listen to the issues. [Applause]\nMy job is to listen and be a voice and my job is to shut other white people down when they want to interrupt (laughter/applause). My job is to shut other white people down when they want to say, ‘Oh, no, i’m not prejudiced. I’m a Democrat. I’m accepting.” My job is to make sure that they get that they have privilege and until we shut our mouths and we listen to those people who don’t and we lift our people up so that we all have equity in this country, so that we’re all fighting alongside each other, so that we are all on the same page and we clearly get where we’re going, we’re not going to break through this.\nHer job, I guess, is to remind white Democrats that they’re racist. Are we sure we don’t want this person running the DNC? Sounds like she’d play great in the newly red Rust Belt, where many hundreds of thousands of out-of-work blue-collar whites spend their days grappling with the question, “Have I done enough to check my privilege?”\nShe’s pretty happy with the attention, though:\n&\nSo apparently I hit a nerve? Was it something I said:) #speakthetruth #indivisblewestand\nPosted by Sally Boynton Brown on  Tuesday, January 24, 2017 \nImagine being a Bernie Sanders or Tim Ryan, eager to see the party get back to basics with class appeals to downscale whites, knowing that Democrats may end up choosing between this pandering idiot and Keith Ellison. What if the Trump era never ends? \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T04:42:19.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
