These include: Making sure that birds' feed and water cannot be accessed by wild birds Avoiding transfer of contamination between premises by cleansing and disinfecting equipment, vehicles and footwear Reducing the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry or captive birds are kept Implementing effective vermin control around buildings where poultry or captive birds are kept Providing wash facilities or dips containing approved disinfectant at key points \nThere have been no known cases of bird flu in domestic poultry or captive birds in Scotland, but several have been confirmed in England and Wales. \nA UK-wide ban on poultry shows and gatherings remains in force. \nMr Ewing said: \"We continue to see daily reports of avian flu across Europe, including eight confirmed cases in domestic birds in England and Wales, with Northern Ireland recently confirming their first finding in a wild bird, too. \n\"We do not expect the risk of H5N8 to reduce any time soon, which is why we are extending the prevention zone until the end of April.\" Image copyright PA Image caption An avian influenza prevention zone was declared on 6 December \nMr Ewing also said the Scottish government would work to minimise the economic impact of the prevention zone on Scotland's free range poultry industry. \nScotland's chief veterinary officer Sheila Voas said: \"The risk level from highly pathogenic avian influenza remains at 'high' for wild birds, and 'low to medium' for domestic birds. \n\"It is essential that keepers continue to ensure that their birds are protected from infection by practicing the highest levels of biosecurity.\" \nShe added: \"Expert advice remains that consumers should not be concerned about eating eggs or poultry and the threat to public health from the virus is very low.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:34:01.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
