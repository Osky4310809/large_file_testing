No more snug coats and sweaters! But what if we told you, you could use those layering-superpowers during summers too. No you don't have to die of a heat-stroke, we promise you! We agree, the harsh sun makes it very hard to break from your T-shirt-and-shorts mould and all you want to do is sit in your air-conditioned room, while waiting for it to get cooler again. \nBut, stay with us on this, because there are creative ways to pull off summer layering. All it takes is little understanding of which fabrics work best, and a willingness to not let summer murder the fashionista in you. Now that you're on board with us and in the need of a sartorial jumpstart, check out these celebs who've managed to pull of the art of layering, when the sun's shining bright. 1. Bomber Jackets \nBomber jackets took over the world last winter and what we gather from the latest street style icons and fashion reports, they are here to stay. To rock your summer, these are now available in the lightest of fabrics and even your everyday T-shirt-and-shorts combo, that we just talked about is going to look like a million bucks with this! 2. Put it over your shoulders \nDenim jackets are an all-year-round affair and with summer dresses nothing works better. The best way to pull off a statement jacket during the summer and not kill yourself in the heat is to work the over-the-shoulder trend. Just place the jacket on your shoulder and strut like the Queen you are! 3. Dress under dress \nA dress under dress (or even the famous, t-shirt under dress) is a combination made for this season. Use fabrics that are light and easy to work. 4. Linen shirts \nA good linen shirt can go a long way in the heat. A shirt worn over a cami is one of the most common trends and every second college girl's favourite! But just like Dia Mirza you can make it look refined and put-together too! 5. Let satin talk \nWhat shook us last week was Sonam Kapoor and her gold glam! All your summer parties can use a stunning silk-satin cape that keeps you cold but turns up the heat around. 6. Make it in mesh \nWe don't need to explain you why mesh works best for summer. Duh! It is funky and you can wear as much as you can without letting the heat get you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T02:46:20.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
