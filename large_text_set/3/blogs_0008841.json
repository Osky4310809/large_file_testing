Philstar.com/Efigenio Toledo IV \nMANILA, Philippines - The Commission on Elections (Comelec) is unlikely to extend the ongoing voter registration for the coming barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) elections. \nComelec spokesman James Jimenez over the weekend said the commission sees no valid reason at this time to extend the registration beyond the April 29 deadline, adding that an extension would adversely affect the poll preparations. \n“Although there has yet to be a formal request for an extension of the voter registration, current prevailing events make it unlikely,” he said, noting that the period is already the “second round” of the one conducted from July 15 to 30 last year. \nA registration was conducted prior to the postponement of the barangay and SK elections, which were to be held on Oct. 31, 2016. \nThe law prohibits registration to be conducted 120 days before a regular election and 90 days before a special election. \n“The registration process also includes sending it to the Election Registration Boards and setting for hearing, among others… Therefore, the filing of applications must end earlier in order to make room for the other processes of registration,” Jimenez said.
