Goldberg will face Kevin Owens this Sunday at WWE Fastlane in a one-on-one match for the Universal Championship, his first title shot in WWE in nearly 5,000 days (His last? Armageddon, 2003). \nGoldberg told GQ that he’s always had a fast metabolism, and in order to maintain his weight and get in shape for events like Fastlane or WrestleMania 33 – where he’ll face Brock Lesnar – he had to eat an “unfathomable” amount of food. \nVia GQ : “The first breakfast I had today, I had six servings of oatmeal, 20 blueberries, and a couple tablespoons of honey on it. Then I trained. Afterwards, I had twelve eggs with two yolks, six pieces of bacon, four pieces of gluten-free toast with avocado. Then a shake. After that I had two gluten-free pizzas with loads and loads of hamburger meat for protein on top of it. Then another shake. My son and I are about to go to Muay Thai, but on the way we’re going to have some pho. Some soup and noodles, some shrimp. Then I’ll do some training at Muay Thai and on the way home we’ll get some pho again for dinner, because the wife hasn’t eaten it yet today. Then I’ll do the family thing, and then I’ll eat again. I don’t know what I’ll have this evening. Probably… I don’t know. I do this meal service called Regiment Meals, and they’ve helped me out tremendously because one of the biggest issues is food preparation. … Tonight I’ll probably do some beef tips and sweet potato fries and an avocado and probably another shake. Then I’ll go workout again, and I’ll have another shake after that, and I’ll do my cheat, which is popcorn.” \nAnd that’s just an average day for Goldberg, who says he stays in his gym at home training until midnight six days a week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:18:09.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
