(Anthony Anex / European Pressphoto Agency) Yvonne Villarreal in the jazz and pop vocal categories.\nNot one to fit into a mold, Jarreau dabbled with rock and reggae and recorded the theme song for the TV series “Moonlighting” as the ’80s carried on. His 1992 album, “Heaven and Earth,” won a Grammy for best R&B vocal performance, giving the artist Grammys in three categories. \nDespite his many TV appearances and touring schedule, Jarreau often lamented the recording business. \n\"I'm this strange kind of fusion of jazz, pop and R&B,\" Jarreau told The Times in 1991. \"Since the beginning of my recording career in 1975, I have had a little difficulty because the pop stations think I'm a jazzer who doesn't have a feeling for pop, so it's hard to get my records played. Similarly, black urban radio doesn't understand that with my R&B roots, I am more than a jazz singer. So I get pigeonholed.\" \nJarreau stretched his talents in other ways, performing with symphony orchestras and acting on Broadway in 1996 in the role of Teen Angel in “Grease.” \nHe eventually came full-circle in 2004 and recorded a straight-ahead jazz album, “Accentuate the Positive.” \nHe picked up two more Grammys in 2007 for a recording made with guitarist George Benson, “Givin’ It Up.” He remained an active performer until his death, playing about 50 concerts last year. \n\"He used to refer to himself as an old geezer,” Reeves said. “But the music kept him young.\" \nA private service will be held for immediate family. No public service is planned at this time, Jarreau’s website said. \nJarreau is survived by his wife, Susan, and son, Ryan. The family requested that contributions be made to the Wisconsin Foundation for School Music, a scholarship fund that Jarreau established. \nThe most-read Entertainment stories this hour »   \nUPDATES: \n4:45 p.m.: This article was updated to include additional comments from Dianne Reeves. \n12:50 p.m.: This article was updated to include more biographical information and details from the artists’ representatives. \nThis article originally published at 11:05 a.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:02:46.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
