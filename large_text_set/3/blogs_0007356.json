However, a statement from the Saudi interior ministry early on Tuesday said the reports were “totally wrong and nobody was tortured ”.\n...\nSaudi media reported last week that police had arrested around 35 people after they raided a party where men were dressed as women and were wearing make-up. The Saudi outlets did not use the word transgender, nor say anyone had been killed.\nIn Pakistan, transgender activist Farzana Riaz told a news conference on Monday that sources in the transgender community in Saudi Arabia had told her the two Pakistanis were beaten to death with sticks.\nSaudi officials claim one person died of a heart attack -- hmm -- but deny any torture took place.\nEven without the apparent murders, keep something in mind here: the Saudi government arrested people simply for wearing women's clothing and acting like women. That's it.\nHere in America, land of liberty, no one at all is even considering laws that prevent people from acting like the opposite gender. At least, no one considered sane.\nWhile trans people do have problems in this country -- while rare, there have been incidents of violence against them -- the LGBT community faces the death penalty in much of the Middle East.\nCan the social justice warriors stop pretending that life in the United States is just unbearably awful? You can acknowledge that things are comparably wonderful here without having to negate your efforts to make it just a bit better.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/07/saudi-government-allegedly-tortures-two-trans-activists-to-death/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/transgender", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-transgender-activists-pakistan-torture-death-police-custody-denial-a7615336.html", "http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Pakistan", "http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SaudiArabia", "http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/torture"], "published": "2017-03-07T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:39:34.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
