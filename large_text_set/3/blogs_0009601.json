Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA young mother has hailed her survival as miraculous after she lost nearly all of the blood in her body after giving birth . \nHeather Armstrong haemorrhaged a massive amount of blood following the delivery of her daughter Ava last December. \nDoctors removed the 24-year-old's placenta manually and found that her uterus was collapsing, but by then she had lost two litres of blood. \nHeather eventually lost nearly four litres of blood during the emergency - with the average adult having 4.7-5.5 litres in their body - and credits hospital staff with saving her life. Heather says she has only just got back to feeling normal again (Photo: Plymouth Herald/SWNS) \nThe young mother was rushed to theatre for an emergency operation where a balloon was inflated and her womb packed to stem the blood.

(Photo: Plymouth Herald/SWNS) \n\"I was on the high dependency unit for five days as my iron levels were not staying high enough and I was at risk of cardiac arrest. \n\"Kieron looked after the baby - I didn't get a chance to care for her - the midwives and nurses were great with Ava. \n\"I was given 10 units of blood, which equated to four litres.\" \nThe mum-of-two has been in and out of hospital since for iron transfusions and blood tests. \nShe said she has only just got back to feeling like herself again after a long and painful recovery after Ava was born - initially without any complications - on December 12. \nHeather added that fortunately, Ava was overdue and needed to be induced in hospital.
