Lacy Clay’s office awarded the display in an art collection last summer, and the placement at the Capitol was as part of the prize. \n“I was angry,” Hunter told Fox News. “I’ve seen the press (reporting) on this for about a week or so. I’m in the Marine Corps. If you want it done, just call us.” \n“There’s nothing appropriate about a painting that depicts police officers at pigs,” Joe Kasper, chief of staff for Rep. Duncan Hunter, told the Washington Examiner . “Rep. Hunter removed the painting and returned it, but as easy as it came down — it can go back up.”   \nThat may be so, but that won’t be he end of it. Hunter, who served two tours in Iraq and one tour in Afghanistan told Fox, “Lacy can put it back up, I guess, if he wants to … but I’m allowed to take it down.” \nFox reported the piece, “Untitled,” was created by David Pulpous, and was reportedly inspired by the 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri. The painting depicts a pig in a police uniform aiming a gun at African-American protesters. This was the painting that Duncan Hunter removed. pic.twitter.com/GxCEEOQ6qP \n— Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) January 6, 2017 \nFox reported that more than 27,000 law enforcement professionals protested the display, and it’s easy to understand why. To put it simply, our officers deserve much more respect than that.
