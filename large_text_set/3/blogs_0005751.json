He’s an incredible player.” \nBale, who had been sidelined through injury since November, scored on his La Liga return at the end of February and played in three internationals with former Manchester United star Giggs. \nThe Welshman, who should make his Champions League return against Napoli in round of 16 second-leg on March 7, also picked out two other legends of the modern era. \n“Ronaldinho, I think, for sheer flair and ability. He was incredible when I played for Wales against Brazil. \n“And I think Andrea Pirlo, one of the masters of the game; controls the field and controls the tempo of the game.” \nWith Real 3-1 up in the match with Napoli, more excitement is promised in the second leg.
