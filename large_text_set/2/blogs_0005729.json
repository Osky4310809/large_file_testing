A. Super Bowl. \nThe Patriots needed a two-point conversion to complete a 21-point comeback and force overtime in Super Bowl 51, with 57 seconds left on the clock. They got it, thanks to a pass from Tom Brady to Danny Amendola. \nAtlanta led 21-0 in the first half and still had control of the game at the start of the fourth quarter, having gone up by 25 at one point. \nBut the Patriots pushed back with three consecutive scores, starting with about two minutes left in the third. A Matt Ryan fumble led to a Danny Amendola touchdown and New England two-point conversion that set the Patriots up with a 28-20 deficit — a one-score game — with more than three minutes to play.\nIt was always unlikely that a Tom Brady-Bill Belichick Patriots team was going to retreat without a fight, even though their most famous fan did . And Patriots didn’t, charging back to give us the kind of thriller that’s become typical of Patriots Super Bowls. This was extremely dramatic, long after it looked like it could never be. \nThe play followed an impossible catch by Patriots receiver Julian Edelman. Despite a slow start, Brady got to 416 passing yards on the New England drive, a Super Bowl record.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:14:12.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
