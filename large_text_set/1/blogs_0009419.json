It appears that whatever rift between the gentlemen has been handled, although West and Kardashian’s little ones were not to be found at the gathering, according to celebrity gossip site X17 . \nBlue Ivy’s 5th birthday jam was at the Carters’ spot in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, with West and Kardashian appearing at the party in understated looks. Kardashian kept things low-key with an oversized plaid button-down and baggy gray sweats. West was equally dressed down in a gray baggy hoody and camouflage pants. \n— X17online.com (@x17online) January 7, 2017 \nTheir appearance at the party was a bit of a head-turning moment, considering that West essentially blasted his Watch The Throne co-collaborator for not checking in on his wife’s predicament during the robbery back in November. \nHe also added that he was “hurt” by alleged comments from Beyoncé regarding 2016’s MTV Video Music Awards and the singer winning the Video Of The Year award over West and Drake. \nUnnamed sources have been spilling the beans about alleged issues between the two couples, even claiming that Jay Z can’t stand “nut job” Kanye West.
