Aiken/Getty Images Mike Chiari Featured Columnist March 7, 2017 New York Jets wide receiver Jalin Marshall is reportedly facing a four-game suspension to begin the 2017 NFL regular season after violating the NFL's policy against performance-enhancing drugs. According to Manish Mehta of the New York Daily News , Marshall tested positive for Adderall. Rich Cimini of ESPN confirmed the report. The 21-year-old wideout joined the Jets as an undrafted free agent out of Ohio State in 2016 and contributed to the tune of 14 receptions for 162 yards and two touchdowns. He was also New York's primary kick and punt returner. Marshall was expected to see increased playing time on offense in 2017 following the recent release of veteran receiver Brandon Marshall . Also, Eric Decker is coming off a torn rotator cuff , which makes depth at the position even more important for the Jets. Provided Marshall misses the first four games of the season, Quincy Enunwa, Robby Anderson, Charone Peake and Devin Smith are the top candidates to step up. New York could also address the position in free agency or the draft, but it isn't yet clear who will be under center. With Ryan Fitzpatrick and Geno Smith almost certain to leave in free agency, Bryce Petty and Christian Hackenberg are the in-house options to start. Regardless of who New York's No. 1 signal-caller is in 2017, that quarterback will be working with a depleted receiving corps in comparison to 2016 due in part to Marshall's suspension.
