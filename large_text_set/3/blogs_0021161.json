For the Broncos and Texans, the key timeframe is early April, when offseason workouts begin. (They can begin as soon as April 3 for Denver because it has a new head coach in Vance Joseph . Teams with returning head coaches, like Houston, can start April 17.) \nRomo has three years remaining on his contract, each with cap charges that average around $24.5 million. But he has a “dead money” value, or cap space allocated to him if he’s cut, of $19.6 million for 2017. If the Cowboys cut or trade him, that $19.6 million counts against their salary cap. If Romo is designated a post-June 1 release, they can spread that amount over two seasons: $10.7 million in 2017 and $8.9 million in 2018, for an even greater cap savings this year — after June 1. Until then, they carry his full salary cap charge of $24.7 million for 2017 season. \nWhile Jones weighs his options — and Romo does, too — the Cowboys re-signed quarterback Kellen Moore to a one-year, $775,000 deal Monday, giving them a third quarterback and Dak Prescott’s backup, should Romo leave. Dallas had met with Josh McCown earlier, but McCown signed a one-year contract with the Jets that includes at least $6 million in guarantees. Moore’s contract counts $615,000 against the cap, according to ESPN . \nAnd in the meantime, the Broncos carried on with its free-agency plan, signing four 300-pounders to beef up the offensive and defensive lines, including a former Romo teammate in guard Ronald Leary. Denver still has needs (left tackle, for one) and plenty of money to fill them, with nearly $21 million in cap according to the NFL Players Association’s records. \nThe Cowboys are in no rush to unload to Romo, and neither the Texans nor the Broncos are in haste to land him via trade. The Broncos, for one, have said repeatedly that they are happy with their two quarterbacks, Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch , and would like to see continued growth out of them. \n“It’s what John (Elway) said, he’s under contract,” Joseph said. “We’re comfortable with our two young guys. We really are. We haven’t met one time about that because we can’t. It’s a non-issue. He’s under contract. We’ve got two good young quarterbacks that we’re happy about. We’re going to put our focus there.” \nBut as team executives convene in Phoenix this weekend (March 26-29) for the annual league meeting, much will surely be discussed. Much can change. \nThe Romo standoff may finally, eventually end.
