But on a good note, we know he is coming to destroy and not to build. \n“Nobody is against Mohammed but let the right thing be done. Let all parties be carried along. Nothing should be done as if the country or TCN is now a secret cult.” \nMohammed suspends company’s accounts \nMeanwhile, Mohammed has placed temporary suspensions on payments, award of contracts and issuance of Local Purchase Orders, LPOs, in the company. \nAn internal memo dated February 3, 2017, and signed by Mr Mohammed, a copy of which was obtained by Vanguard , stated: “Sequel to my assumption of duty on appointment as Transitional Chief Executive Officer of TCN, and in view of effecting controls on our payment systems, repositioning the organisation for greater transparency and improved efficiency, you are hereby directed to suspend all payments in all TCN related accounts with immediate effect. \n“This comprises all payments of capital projects through GIFMIS account, REMITA payment platform, via Treasury Single Account, TSA, with CBN and payment via CBN foreign transaction accounts in HQ, except operational activities which must have the approval of the Transitional Chief Executive Officer, TCN.” \nAppointment of TCN boss not condition for AfDB loan —Fashola \nMeanwhile, Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr. Fashola, told the National Assembly in Abuja, yesterday, that Mohammed’s appointment was not a condition for the loan facility from the bank. \nSpeaking in Abuja when he appeared before the Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe-led Senate Committee on Power, Steel Development and Metallurgy and House of Representatives Joint Committee, led by Daniel Asuquo, Fashola explained that the replacement of Atiku Abubakar with Mohammed did not breach any law because the position had been vacant. \nThe minister, who noted that Muhammed’s appointment could not be reversed, against the backdrop that it was carried out in line in with a Presidential directive, said the President had the prerogative of making any political appointment. \nSpeaking further, Fashola explained that Mohammed had previously worked in the power sector for 17 and half years as head of Finance. \nHe also said there had been series of petitions and infighting among Manitoba, the managing consulting firm hired by Federal Government for TCN and previous management of TCN. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:56:35.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
