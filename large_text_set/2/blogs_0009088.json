LOUIS • A St. Louis man seen tossing aside an Uzi firearm as police searched a house in connection with a Florissant murder investigation now faces a federal firearm charge. \nDevon L. Guice, 26, was arrested at a home in the 3400 block of Pestalozzi Street last week after police found him with a round of .223-caliber ammunition in his pocket, which matches the caliber used in the Florissant case, charging documents claim. \nKilled in the Florissant shooting was Antwoine Robinson, 20 . He was found dead inside a home in the 1300 block of Stoneberry Court on Feb. 1. \nPolice had been led to the house in St. Louis after four or five men were seen running from the scene of the Florissant shooting, a Florissant police officer wrote in an affidavit supporting the charge against Guice. \nThe license plate of the car that the fleeing men used led to the home on Pestalozzi, the Florissant officer wrote, and officers later searched the house. They spotted Guice tossing the 9 mm Uzi before running into the basement, where they found him hiding under an air mattress, police said. \nIn his pocket was the .223-caliber ammo, the affidavit says. Police also found what they believed to be heroin. \nGuice faces a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm and/or ammunition. \nIn court Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bird asked U.S. Magistrate Judge John Bodenhausen to hold Guice in jail until trial. Bird cited prior convictions for assault, unlawful use of a weapon and armed criminal action, as well as arrests without conviction for murder and other charges, and prior gang membership. \nLucille Liggett, a federal public defender, responded that Guice’s last conviction was almost seven years old, and that he has close ties to the St. Louis community, including his fiancee, who was present in court. \nBodenhausen said he would take the issue under advisement, but that he was leaning toward keeping Guice in jail. \nAuthorities asked anyone with information in Robinson’s death to contact the Florissant Police Department at 314-831-7000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:12:31.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
