Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nParents Emma and John Power already felt pretty special when they were blessed with not one, but two sets of twins. \nBut what makes it all the more remarkable is that neither were planned. \nEmma, 30, was using different types of contraception when both were conceived. \nThe odds of it happening are believe to be as high as one in three billion. \nEmma was using the Pill when she fell pregnant with sons Connor and Kyle who are now ten. \nShe said she was shocked because she'd been taking the Pill every day and hadn't been ill. \nAfter the boys were safely delivered, the couple, from York, decided to change contraception and Emma got an implant. \nIt's supposed to be 99 per cent effective but five years later Emma found herself pregnant again. \nAnd she was left even more astonished when her scan showed they were again expecting twins. \nAfter Jessica and Ruby, now aged four, were born, the couple are now taking no chances. \nShe has been sterilised and John has also had a vasectomy. \nEmma told the Daily Mail: \"The doctors said that I must be incredibly fertile. \n\"I do feel very lucky to have my two sets of twins â€“ even if they ... were a complete surprise.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:05:57.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
