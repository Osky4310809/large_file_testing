NASA estimates that “The Agency cannot support human missions greater than approximately 90 to 100 days beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) without developing shielding and/or biological countermeasures to remain below Permissible Exposure Limits.” It will take a lot of R&D to support missions beyond LEO for one year, let alone 600 in deep space. Our sun's magnetic activity could help to shield astronauts during a mission to Mars if the journey is timed correctly, but out in the deep dark space between galaxies, there may be no such protection. Faster than light travel isn't possible, so you'll die of old age in transit if the space rays don't get you \nMass Effect: Andromeda's take: The entire series is named after a useful science fiction conceit that allows Shepard, Ryder and chums to go on exciting space adventures without having to worry about the laws of physics. In Mass Effect's future humanity exploits the made-up Element Zero to manipulate the mass of objects. In Andromeda FTL drives reduce the mass of your ship, allowing it to greatly exceed light speed. \nThe reality: We can't do this. Without a Mass Effect drive we're doomed to travel the vast distances between galaxies. Even travelling at light speed you'll take 2.5 million years to get there. If we haven't cracked cryogenics, we'll need a generational ship capable of supporting 10,000 humans for millions of years. If you can build a ship capable of that, you don't need habitable planets anymore, you might as well build a massive ark and live on it. \nTo preserve the mission you need to design a society that will retain its values for a time longer than humans have so far existed. \nBut let's say you really want to see Andromeda, for its lovely black holes. Then to preserve the mission you need to design a society that will retain its values for a time longer than humans have so far existed. Over this sort of time period you might even see evolutionary development that selects a spacefaring existence. By the time humans reach the edge of Andromeda, would they even want to live on a planet? Perhaps they would prefer to scavenge resources, grow the ark and keep on trucking, living on as a nomadic offshoot of humanity that we would barely recognise. \nWhatever happens, you'll be long dead. What's more, Having enjoyed life with a horizon and solid ground underfoot, you will live out the rest of your days in a tin can. This is all that future generations will ever know, but at least they will be spared homesickness and the horrible possibility that a few years after launch, dreaming of oceans and cities, you might start to seriously regret your decision. \nAll things considered, it's better just to stay on Earth and fight the Reapers.
