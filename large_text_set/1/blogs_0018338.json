REUTERS/Piya Sinha-Roy 5435270 \nAn unnamed crying protester screamed “God loves everybody” when she came across a Christian attempting to speak to the crowd Saturday morning. \nA video obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation shows a young protester attempting to block the man as he recited passages from the Bible. \nWATCH: \nThe unnamed protester was attending the Women’s March on Washington near L’enfant Plaza in Southwest D.C. The man attempted to reason with the protester by asserting that he didn’t hate any of the protesters, he just wanted them to find Jesus. \nThe young woman said the man, “is telling me to come to Jesus Christ, someone who is against everything we stand for.” Several members of the crowd came over and accosted the man. \nWATCH: \nHe then screamed at the protester, to which she replied, “Where in the Bible does it say it’s OK to scream at people? Where did Jesus scream at people and accuse them?” \nHe didn’t respond to the statement, instead choosing to continue to quote scripture during the entirety of the exchange. The man quickly finishes with, “You’re going to hell, you’re full of Satan.” \nThe rest of the crowd chanted, “get your rosaries off my ovaries!” \nThe Women’s March On Washington is the culmination of three days of protesting on the weekend of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. So far, more than 200 protesters have been arrested after vandalizing a Starbucks, a Bank of America, and setting a limo on fire. Several fires were started across the city, mostly in the middle of busy streets like D.C.’s famous K Street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:57:33.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
