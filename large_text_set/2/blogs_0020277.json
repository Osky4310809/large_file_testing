While we’re super excited to see who wins and what shenanigans go down at the after parties, we’re really looking forward to the red carpet arrivals. There have been some truly sensational dresses worn in Oscar history , and in a year when designers everywhere are making political statements on the runway, we’re sure to see some head-turning gowns.\nIn honor of the magic that’s coming our way on February 26th, we put together a list of 10 of the best Oscars dresses ever (in our humble opinion). From the iconic to the unexpected, these gowns made us feel things . Read on for our picks, in particular order!\nPenelope Cruz, 2007 Stephen Shugerman/Getty Images Wearing a feathered, blush-colored Versace gown, Penelope Cruz positively stunned at the 2007 Oscars. Not only was her gown perfectly fitted, it danced along the red carpet behind her as she strolled.\nAudrey Hepburn, 1968 Ron Galella/WireImage/Getty Images Audrey Hepburn has always been a fashion icon, but her Givenchy gown at the 1968 Academy Awards was particularly stunning. Heavily embellished on top and flowing from the bust to the floor, the dress was mesmerizing.\nBeyoncé, 2009 Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images Looking like a glittering Oscar statue herself, Beyoncé’s 2009 Academy Awards dress was like no other. The best part? The gown was from her family’s own House of Dereon line. Talk about being a #girlboss.\nBjörk, 2001 SGranitz/WireImage/Getty Images This list would not be complete without singer Björk’s unforgettable swan dress. While mocked at the time she wore it, the dress was recently displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Take that, fashion bullies!\n\nAngelina Jolie, 2012 Bob Riha, Jr./Getty Images Who could forget Angie in this remarkable Versace gown? Everywhere she went, J olie planted her right foot proudly and showed off her strong thigh, owning the red carpet and the Oscars stage. It was an unforgettable sight!\nHillary Swank, 2005 Dan MacMedan/WireImage/Getty Images Wearing a back-baring navy blue gown by Guy Laroche, Hillary Swank was arguably the only star who mattered on the 2005 Oscars red carpet. And oh yeah, she won Best Actress for her role in Million Dollar Baby that year, too. NBD.\nGwyneth Paltrow, 1999 Ke.Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images The ’90s were admittedly not the best time in Oscars fashion history (you can understand why). But Gwyneth Paltrow’s epic pink taffeta gown by Ralph Lauren goes down in history as one of the award show’s best.\nElizabeth Taylor, 1961 Darlene Hammond/Hulton Archive/Getty Images It was the year she won Best Actress for Butterfield 8 — and the year she won our hearts in a flower garden-inspired dress by Christian Dior.\nHalle Berry, 2003 Kevin Winter/Getty Images Glittering in gold from head to toe, Halle Berry came to slay in this Elie Saab gown.\nSharon Stone, 1998 Mychal Watts/WireImage/Getty Images Last but certainly not least on this list is Sharon Stone in 1998. That year, the actress combined a Vera Wang skirt with a Gap blouse for an insanely chic — and steal-able! — high-low, menswear-inspired look.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:02:42.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
