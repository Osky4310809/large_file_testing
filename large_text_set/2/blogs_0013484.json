In the five years after the accident, he lost his job, family and home. \nKosikar has now turned his life around and is hoping to help other first responders suffering from PTSD. Story continues below \nKosikar is behind the “It’s not weak to speak – Not all wounds are visible ” campaign to destigmatize PTSD and bring awareness to Bill M203 , which aims to provide support for British Columbia’s first responders affected by PTSD sooner. \n“We need the help immediately,” said Kosikar. “We should not have to prove our PTSD happened at work. We are first repsonders and we take the trauma home with us daily. It affects not only us, but our families and our friends. It is unacceptable and our provincial government needs to make changes.” \nAfter Kosikar and his team reach the summit, they will have to flip the same tire for another 1,150 kilometres around B.C. to raise awareness about the campaign. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:49:16.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
