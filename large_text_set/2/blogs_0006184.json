Courtesy of Halima Satol, City Information Office \nCOTABATO CITY, Philippines - Local traders welcomed positively the three-day visit here of technocrats from China to disseminate the viability of renewable energy for street lighting and other industrial needs. \nChinese engineers on Tuesday installed on three selected spots here streetlights designed to operate only with solar energy using sunlight panels and electricity generated by individual mini wind turbines. \n“Their coming over is something very positive. It will disprove the perception of outsiders that foreign entrepreneurs and capitalists are not safe here in the city,” Sandra Siang, president of the Kutawato Muslim Business Chamber said on Wednesday. \nThe Chinese technocrats representing the engineering firms Beijing You Sheng, the Shanghai Dianou Industrial Company and the Sheng Corai Power erected here samples of the streetlights they can produce on large-scale basis for a contract. \nRepresentatives of the three engineering firms arrived here early this week to proceed with their product experiment along with the city government after preliminary discussions with Mayor Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi during an official mission to China last year. \nGuiani-Sayadi, who is of mixed Maguindanaon-Chinese heritage, was still an appointed city administrator at that time.
