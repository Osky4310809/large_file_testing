Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGary Neville defended Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's team selection in their shock FA Cup fourth-round defeat to Wolves. \nThe Reds succumbed to their third home defeat in a week as Paul Lambert's side ensured a continuation to their miserable start to 2017. \nLiverpool have just once in eight games since the turn of the year - a run which has all but ended their hopes of silverware this season. \nKlopp named a much-changed starting line-up to the one that was knocked out of the EFL Cup by Southampton on Wednesday night, with Ben Woodburn, Connor Randall, Ovie Ejaria and Joe Gomez among nine alterations made by the German for Wolves' visit. \nAfter Lambert's men raced into a two-goal lead at Anfield, Klopp was accused of showing a lack of respect to the FA Cup by Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker.

It's how I was given the chance to be a player. Getting a run out in cup games!!\". \nLiverpool host Chelsea next at Anfield on Tuesday with a chance to reduce the Premier League leaders' 10-point gap at the top of the table.
