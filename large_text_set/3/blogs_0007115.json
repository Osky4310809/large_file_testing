Science Urine levels in swimming pools revealed by study \nOne pool had 75 litres – 132 pints – of urine, which can react with disinfectant to cause asthma and eye irritation  16   Online Public health officials in Canada say they'll be investigating Kevork Djansezian/Getty \nIt is the question most people going swimming really don't want to think about: just how much pee is in this pool? \nHowever, despite this, a team of academics helpfully set out to provide a scientific answer for the edification of humanity, taking more than 250 samples from 31 different pools and hot-tubs. \nAnd the results make alarming reading. \nOne swimming pool, which was about a third the size of an Olympic-sized one, had an astonishing 75 litres – 132 pints – of urine, while a smaller pool had 30 litres. Multivitamins just create 'very expensive urine', medical chief warns \nThe study was carried out in two unidentified cities in Canada, but it seems likely pool-peeing habits are similar in the rest of the world. \n“Even though no one would admit to peeing in a pool, obviously somebody has to be doing it,” said one of the researchers, Lindsay Blackstock, a PhD student of analytical and environmental toxicology at Alberta University. \nWhile some people swear by the health benefits of drinking urine, which is sterile, taking a gulp of the stuff in a swimming pool is not a good idea. \nThis is because it can become harmful – potentially causing asthma and eye irritation – after mixing with chemicals in the water. Read more \nThe researchers actually tested the water for an artificial sweetener called acesulfame-K, commonly found in processed foods and fizzy drinks. \nThis is commonly found in urine because it passes straight through the body undigested. \nWriting in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letter s , the researchers said the “overnight colour change of the water from blue to green in the 2016 Rio Olympic pools” had highlighted “the need to monitor water quality in swimming pools”. \n“Urine contains many nitrogenous compounds such as urea, ammonia, amino acids, and creatinine,” they said. \n“These compounds can react with disinfectants (e.g., chlorine) in swimming pools to form disinfection byproducts (DBPs). \n“Exposure to volatile DBPs, specifically trichloramine, in indoor swimming facilities can lead to eye and respiratory irritation and has been linked to occupational asthma. \n“Although considered a taboo, 19 per cent of adults have admitted to having urinated in a swimming pool at least once.” World news in pictures World news in pictures 1/29 28 February 2017 \nAn Israeli youth supporter of settlements cries as Israeli police forces move protestors away from a house which is due to be emptied and demolished in the settlement of Ofra in the occupied West Bank, during an operation by Israeli forces.
