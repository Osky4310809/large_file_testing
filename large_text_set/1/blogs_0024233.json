ID: 10406459 1. First, we REALLY don’t care whether you shave your legs or not. View this image ›\nUniversal Pictures / Via popkey.co ID: 10387118 2. Or if you’ve groomed down there. View this image ›\nMTV / Via mtvgirlcode.tumblr.com Actually, pubic hair can help prevent infections and we’d rather you be careful down there and not risk cutting yourself.\nID: 10392056 3. When we make small talk, we’re just trying to help you relax so we can make the exam as quick and painless as possible. View this image ›\ninstagram.com / Via Instagram: @ohsewresinating We’ve found that most of the time, people will relax their muscles as soon as they talk about something comfortable and familiar. That’s why we tend to ask them simple questions about themselves while we’re doing parts of the exam that may feel uncomfortable.\nID: 10392113 4. We’ve been vomited on, peed on, pooped on; there’s not really a bodily fluid we haven’t encountered. View this image ›\ntenor.co Let’s just say it’s extremely hard to gross us out.\nID: 10392175 5. We may see up to 100 vaginas a week, so looking at yours is just a normal day at the job. View this image ›\nHULU In other words, there’s no need to be uncomfortable.\nID: 10389085 6. Everyone tells us they’re self-conscious about what their vagina or vulva looks and smells like, BUT everyone is different. View this image ›\ninstagram.com / Via Instagram: @suzanna_scott No vulva is the same as another, and therefore there is no “normal vulva.” Some vulvas have larger labias, some have smaller labias. The look, smell, size, and color varies, and we’d love for women to embrace that instead of buying products and trying to shove things up there that could put them at risk for infections.\nID: 10392066 7. But when we’re at social gatherings, we don’t really want to be asked about all the different types of vulvas and vaginas we get to see. View this image ›\nLogoTV / Via logotv.com There’s a place and a time. Obviously, that’s not why we chose to go to school for 8+ years to become an OB-GYN.\nID: 10392019 8. By the way, all of us are FULLY TRAINED surgeons. We don’t just give annual exams. View this image ›\nABC / Via seasonofbloom.wordpress.com Our job doesn’t just consist of Pap smear tests and prescribing birth control. As gynecologists, some of us actually get to operate a bit, performing two of the most common surgeries: C-sections and hysterectomies.\nID: 10392024 9. We’re really good at holding our pee. View this image ›\nNBC / Via tenor.co You don’t get too many opportunities to make it to the bathroom when you’re in surgery or helping deliver a baby.\nID: 10392183 10. And a lot of the time we don’t know when our next meal is going to be. View this image ›\nABC You can try to plan out your day. But the truth is, babies rarely ever come on schedule. So sometimes you’ll go an entire shift without eating, or you’ll try to wolf down a meal as fast as you can in between appointments or surgeries because you never know when you’re going to eat next.\nID: 10399371 11. We get really excited about the weird stuff that happens, like finding teeth and hair in tumors. View this image ›\nABC Yes, sometimes hair and teeth, along with a lot of other stuff, can grow in ovarian tumors.\nID: 10392229 12. And we usually have photos or videos of tumors, bacteria, huge cysts, or uteruses on our phone. View this image ›\nParamount Pictures / Via imgur.com These are usually to show patients what we took out of them after the surgery is over. As long as there’s no patient identification, it’s okay. And we might have videos of microscope slides showing bacteria swimming around from a vaginal swab to show patients what the bacteria looks like.\nID: 10398434 13. And yes, some of us are men. View this image ›\nABC / Via wifflegif.com Men who you can also be comfortable with, who are great at their jobs, and who we’d send our own family members to.\nID: 10387037 14. We’re not here to judge your sexual history or preferences; we just want you to be honest with us so we can help you be safe. View this image ›\ninstagram.com / Via Instagram: @bustle Trust us, we hear it all. So there’s not much that phases us. All we want is for you to tell us as much as possible so that we can help keep you healthy.\nID: 10389079 15. We live at a baseline of exhaustion, AKA we are always tired. View this image ›\nFOX There’s no restriction on how many hours that we work or when we have to work them. Some shifts can be extremely long because you can’t predict how things are going to go.\nID: 10392225 16. It’s not that we don’t care, we just really don’t know whether or not your STI means your partner cheated on you. View this image ›\nUSA Network / Via reactiongifs.com When you get test results back that are positive for an STI, we know it’s upsetting and we want to be there for you. But we don’t really want to talk about whether or not your partner cheated on you because there’s no way for us to give you that answer. We just really want you (and your partner) to take the medication.\nID: 10392305 17. It’s really frustrating when patients come in and tell us the diagnosis they got from the internet. View this image ›\nComedy Central / Via comedycentral.tumblr.com We went to school and trained for a long time in order to be able to exam you and diagnose you. Please, don’t come in telling us that you already know the source of the issue because of something you read online and that you just want the treatment for it. We need to give you an exam and look over the results to make sure we know exactly what’s going on.\nID: 10392177 18. We find lots of random, sometimes odd, objects in vaginas. View this image ›\nyoutube.com / Via tenor.co We call them “retained foreign bodies.” Please, please be careful about what you’re sticking up there. Usually we find forgotten tampons and used condoms. But every now and then we’ll find something else like marbles, Legos, keys, etc.\nID: 10392172 19. Our schedules can be incredibly demanding and we often have to work through weekends and holidays. View this image ›\ninstagram.com / Via Instagram: @cinthiaacorreia ID: 10392216 20. So our coworkers tend to become family because of how much time we spend together. View this image ›\ninstagram.com / Via Instagram: @juanito73 It does differ from practice to practice, but there’s a huge sense of camaraderie. We probably see them more than we see our own families.\nID: 10392188 21. We get a lot of middle-of-the-night phone calls, because we’re basically on-call always. View this image ›\ninstagram.com There’s a lot about the job that you can’t predict or plan for. We’ll get calls from patients at any hour asking what their symptoms mean or saying they think they their water broke. But even if we’re up all night, we still have to make our morning appointments as scheduled.\nID: 10392220 22. And our days can sometimes be a mix of check-ups, surgeries, and deliveries. View this image ›\nUniversal Pictures / Via giphy.com Our schedule is different every single day. We can have a surgery scheduled for the morning and then be back in the office that afternoon to give patients their exams or go over test results with them.\nID: 10392237 23. We really want people to understand that pelvic exams are not the same as Pap smears. View this image ›\nHBO So even if you’re not due for a Pap smear, you should still go in to see a gyno for a check-up and a pelvic exam once a year.\n(Recommendations may vary by age and medical history, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends annual pelvic exams for anyone 21 and older.)\nID: 10387130 24. It’s impossible for us to not to be affected by our jobs. View this image ›\ninstagram.com / Via Instagram: @berkemokten Many of us go into this field because we want to take care of women. We get incredibly invested in our patients and love seeing them thrive and raise their families. So yes, sometimes we get emotional after seeing patients. We cry from being happy and we cry from being heartbroken. We just find our own time to do it.\nID: 10392169 25. And it never gets easier to give bad news. View this image ›\ninstagram.com / Via Instagram: @vangyknits Like when you have to tell a patient that you can no longer find a heartbeat on the ultrasound.\nID: 10387087 26. But we also never really get over the fact that we’re helping bring life into this world. View this image ›\nUniversal Pictures Although we may get over being up at 3 a.m.\nID: 10389072 27. And honestly, we really want to see you at least once a year. View this image ›\ninstagram.com / Via Instagram: @plannedparenthood You can’t tell how healthy you are down there from the outside, and sometimes getting your annual exams can be life-saving. We want to answer your questions if something seems off, provide you with birth control and information on how to use it if you need it, and make sure that everything is in tip-top shape down there. It’s only a little bit of your time but it will always be worth it.\nID: 10392068 ", "external_links": ["https://www.tenor.co/view/telephone-beyonce-oops-cute-imessedup-gif-4005225", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPUAnR1BP3h/", "https://www.instagram.com/cinthiaacorreia/", "http://comedycentral.tumblr.com/post/74323727538/turn-your-head-cough-and-click-the-gif-to-watch", "https://www.tenor.co/view/peepants-parksandrec-gif-5381422", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BCs8DVSJo8M/", "http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Well-Woman-Visit", "https://www.instagram.com/p/4PukJKSVwI/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BMrQ5caDgK1/", "http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls-drag-race", "https://www.instagram.com/berkemokten/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVBsypHzF3U", "http://giphy.com/gifs/bored-despicable-me-ballet-Pyt59afq2ewdG", "https://www.instagram.com/plannedparenthood/", "http://popkey.co/m/xMDQX-bridesmaids-prickly-leg-hair", "http://www.reactiongifs.com/house-shrug/", "https://www.tenor.co/view/dave-franco-gif-7288879", "https://www.instagram.com/vangyknits/", "https://www.instagram.com/ohsewresinating/", "http://imgur.com/gallery/3jhWOnf", "https://www.instagram.com/bustle/", "https://seasonofbloom.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/greys-anatomy-s12xep13-all-eyez-on-me/", "http://drdweck.com/", "https://www.instagram.com/suzanna_scott/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/z5tzoMgZww/", "http://wifflegif.com/gifs/339911-justin-chambers-greys-anatomy-gif", "https://www.instagram.com/p/6VSnxFAMOZ/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BObHMushJZd/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPkj3U6huBq/", "https://www.instagram.com/juanito73/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/poj31Zxw9r/"], "published": "2017-01-29T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T16:07:12.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
