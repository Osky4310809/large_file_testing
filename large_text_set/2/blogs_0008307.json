Currently, the show is running it's second season. Although the first season did fantastic on viewership, the second season is struggling with TRPs, from what we hear. The Cancel Bear, which is a TV ratings tracking system, has classified Quantico into the 'likey to be cancelled' category. Which means that the show might soon go off air. This comes as a sad news for all Quantico fans. \nThe show has a rating of 0.76, which is considerably low. It was moved to the Monday slots in hopes to get better viewership, but that didn't change much. Hence the show is on the verge of getting canceled, as per the Cancel Bear. \nThe office quotes, \" Quantico probably won't move much higher than its current ratings, this season. It is what it is at this point, and that's a show ABC should cut ties with at season's end.\" \nThis is so sad!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:35:07.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
