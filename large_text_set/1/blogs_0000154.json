I actually think this is gonna work out just fine for that lovely couple (provided that she said ‘yes’ after she pulled herself up off the ground). All any girl every wants is a splashy, memorable proposal and that’s exactly what she got. For sure memorable. One, it was at an EDM concert which is just fucking weird. I don’t mind some EDM music but there is a 400% chance we all look back at the EDM music era and go,”What the fuck was going on there?” It’s by far the music of this generation that everyone in the future will be confused about. I’m kinda confused about it right now and I’m living in the era. And two, the part where she went tumbling off the stage immediately after being proposed to will be the most memorable part. Especially since she can bounce her grand kids on her knee and show them the YouTube video of it. Hell, maybe she’ll even Google it and this blog will pop up. In that case, hey there pretty lady. You’re old and wrinkled now and are showing your grand kids this. That’s cool. You had a great ass once-upon-a-time. Nice job.
