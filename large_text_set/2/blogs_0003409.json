It depicted a day night cycle over rolling green fields with an outpost to the side of the frame. If one didn't know any better, it looked like it would fit right in with a Mass Effect title (granted it was teased at the end of a Mass Effect: Andromeda presentation). \nWhile details surrounding the title are slim, we know that Dragon Age lead writer David Gaider is on board , so RPG or not, expect some flavourful dialogue.
