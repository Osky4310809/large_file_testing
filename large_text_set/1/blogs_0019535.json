I’ve been in and out of the team and I need to keep trying to perform and score to stay in the team.” Mourinho has other ideas, though \nJose Mourinho won’t stand in Wayne Rooney's way if he wants a big-money move to China, writes David Anderson. \nChinese champions Guangzhou Evergrande and Super League rivals Beijing Guoan are prepared to fork out a staggering £700,000-a-week to lure record-breaking Rooney away from Manchester United this summer.

It’s their life, it’s their organisation of their life, their organisation of their career. \n“The money is huge. The experience can also be interesting. \n“I know some of my colleagues think they are more important than they are and think they can interfere in the lives of other people, but I’m not that sort of guy.\" United stars facing pay cut if Champions League qualification fails them \nManchester United stars will reportedly lose a chunk of their wages if the Red Devils fail to qualify for the Champions League again this season, writes James Whaling. \nPlayers face losing up to 25 per cent of their pay packet should United miss out on the top four, report The Sun.
