The bag, inspired by Donald Trump calling Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman” back during the last presidential debate of 2016, is one you’re gonna want to get your hands on — and your arms through.\nAccording to her February 13th post, Roberts is acting alongside Patrick Gibson in a new movie. It’s from Sam Boyd, who is best known for creating the short film In a Relationship with Dakota Johnson. (Actually, based on Roberts’ post, she might even be in a continuation of the 19-minute movie.)\nEither way, while on set for the new movie, Roberts sported a tote that says, “The United States of Nasty Women” and it’s pretty awesome. Oh the joys #inarelationship #newmovie @aboutaboyd : @kpreiss \nA photo posted by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Feb 13, 2017 at 9:38am PST \nIf you love the pro-Clinton message and inclusivity of Roberts’ tote bag , then you’ll be incredibly happy to find out that it’s available on Etsy . And to top it all off, it’s only $18 \nKimothy Joy / www.etsy.com From Etsy shop owner Kimothy Joy, this tote is made of heavy canvas and 20% of the proceeds from the bag go to Planned Parenthood .\nIf you don’t want to exactly match Roberts’ character, there are also variations of this design. You can get it on a T-shirt for $30 or have the faces of the diverse group of women on a bag that says: “The Future Is Female” instead.\nKimothy Joy / www.etsy.com The downside is that the products all have limited supplies and were listed as pre-orders. Yet, as of February 13th, you could add the tote bag to your Etsy cart, so it looks like it’s still available.\nWhile Roberts might be rocking the Nasty Woman tote for a character she is portraying, the Scream Queens actress has been a vocal supporter of Clinton . So, if you’re looking for a way to display your feminism even during President Trump’s presidency, you should channel Roberts and get this tote around your arm.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:06:04.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
