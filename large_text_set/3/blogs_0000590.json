That ruling will now allow Kang to join the Pirates at Spring Training.\n#Pirates 3B Jung Ho Kang received an 8-month sentence suspended for 2 years over DUI charges. He's now free to join Buccos' camp.\n— Jeeho Yoo (@Jeeho_1) March 3, 2017 \n\"Suspended\" sentence isn't unique to Korea, I don't think. Kang doesn't have to serve if he keeps his record clean for 2 years.\n— Jeeho Yoo (@Jeeho_1) March 3, 2017 \nThe Yonhap News Agency reports that prosecutors in the case were seeking a fine equal to more than $13,000 U.S. dollars; but, the South Korean court determined the case was serious enough that they wanted it to go to trial.\nPolice say Kang was drunk last December when he wrecked his car in Seoul. It was his third DUI arrest in South Korea since 2009.\nA friend of Kang also attended the court hearing last month after being charged for falsely telling police that he, not Kang, was driving the vehicle.\nAfter the hearing, Kang said, “I deeply regret what I have done. If I can get one last chance, I will become an exemplary player to earn respect from everyone.”\nKang hit 21 home runs and 62 RBIs in 108 games in 2016 in his second season in the majors.\nJoin The Conversation On The KDKA Facebook Page \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \n(© Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
