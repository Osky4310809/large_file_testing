You can use either the standard version of Raspbian or the Lite version, as you’ll only be using the command line for this guide. Follow our guide here to set up Raspbian (be sure to change your default password during this process) and this guide to enable SSH if you want to talk to your Raspberry Pi from any computer on your home network. Once you’ve gathered everything together, make sure your Raspberry Pi is connected directly to your router with an ethernet cable, then go ahead and plug it in. Step One: Install the Necessary Software \nThe first thing we’ll need to do is make the Raspberry Pi 3’s Wi-Fi capable of acting like an access point. This turns it into a hotspot so you’ll be able to connect to it from your main computer just like you would any wireless network. We’ll be doing all this from the Raspberry Pi’s command line: Advertisement Type in sudo apt-get update and press Enter. Type in sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent git Select Yes and press Enter the two times you’re prompted to. \nNow that everything’s been downloaded and installed, it’s time to set it up. Step Two: Turn Your Raspberry Pi Into An Access Point \nThe process for turning a Raspberry Pi into an access point is a bit complicated, but thankfully GitHub user harryallerston created a script that automates the whole process. Type in git clone https://github.com/unixabg/RPI-Wireless-Hotspot.git and press Enter. Type in cd RPI-Wireless-Hotspot and press Enter. Type in sudo ./install and press Enter. This starts the installation process. Press Y to agree to the terms, Y to use preconfigured DNS server, N to using Unblock-Us servers, Y to using OpenDNS, then N for the Wi-Fi defaults. When prompted after the default question, enter a new password. This is the password to connect to your Pi-powered network. When prompted, enter a new SSID, this is the name of your network. Enter a channel number. 6 is fine, unless you know you need something else. Enter N for the rest of the questions. \nOnce it’s complete, your Raspberry Pi will reboot and should now work as an access point. You can test this out by heading to another computer or phone, selecting your Raspberry Pi from the Wi-Fi network list, and seeing if the internet works. If for some reason it does not, Adafruit has a guide for doing this all manually. Otherwise, continue on and install the Tor proxy software. Step Five: Install TOR \nTor has a pretty straight-forward set up process, but you’ll still need to tweak a few things to get it working.
