You ask. Well the above video should explain. \nThe clip shows the Italian speaking ahead of the Blues' Premier League clash at Turf Moor when he is asked about his side's opposition. Who are ya? (Photo: PA) \nWell in particularly he is asked whether he is aware of the one and only Barton. \nAnd well, he isn't. \nLooking to his assistant for help, a completely baffled Conte can be seen asking: \"Who is Joey Barton?\" \nIt's pretty awkward, and perhaps the answer he receives only makes it worse. Here you go Conte, this is Joey Barton (Photo: PA) \nInstead of trying to explain who Barton is - which probably would have been hilarious - his assistant simplifies the question somewhat. \n\"Are you familiar with the Burnley players, or any of the Burnley players in particular?\" \nWe're guessing he isn't... but it's just a guess mind you.
