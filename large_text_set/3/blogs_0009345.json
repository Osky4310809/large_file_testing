The self-described Romanian hacktivist claimed in a June 15 blog post that he had compromised the DNC — not Russian hackers, as experts had indicated — and said he had supplied WikiLeaks with a trove of documents ultimately published by the antisecrecy website the following month. \nStone wrote an article pointing to Guccifer 2.0 in order to exonerate the Russian government from the accusation by experts that they had hacked the DNC. \nThe hacker contacted Stone, calling him a “great man,” for writing about him, and offered, “please tell me if i can help u anyhow. it would be a great pleasure to me.” \nCritics of Trump have taken this interaction to be proof that the Trump administration was somehow colluding to hack the DNC and use the information spread by WikiLeaks to damage Democrats in the election. Even Hillary Clinton herself admitted that she believed Russians influenced the election to tilt towards Trump. DT advisor Roger Stone in direct contact with Russian hacker Guccifer 2.0. The smoke is starting to become fire. #TrumpRussia \n— Rob Reiner (@robreiner) March 9, 2017 In coming days, expect to hear about communications between Roger Stone (Trump advisor) and Guccifer 2.0 (Russian hackers who hit the DNC). \n— George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) March 9, 2017 1/ Now we know Roger Stone communicated with GRU agent(s) posing as Guccifer 2.0 who interfered in the US election to elect Donald Trump. \n— Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 11, 2017 \nBut Stone waves off these accusations, saying that the timeline of events doesn’t support the speculation of collusion with the Trump campaign. \n“Even if [Guccifer 2.0] is/was a Russian asset, my brief Aug. 14 correspondence with him on twitter comes AFTER I wrote about his role in the DNC hacks (Aug 5) and AFTER Wikileaks released the DNC material,” Mr. Stone clarified on Friday. “How does one collaborate on a matter after the fact?” \nGuccifer 2.0 is now believed to be a persona used by Russian state actors to spread the information hacked from the DNC, according to U.S. intelligence authorities.
