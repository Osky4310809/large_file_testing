That’s like killing a unicorn!” These have become cultural touchstones for our generation, and elevated the comedic timing of humans around the globe. \nAs we anxiously await for Archer’s 8th season, Archer: Dreamland , we want to see your phrasing – put yourself in Sterling Archer’s shoes and caption this photo ! \nWinner and runner-up gets the sweet Chivery prize packages shown below.
