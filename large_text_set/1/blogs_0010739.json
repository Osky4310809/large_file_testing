While the trend was kicked off by the Silisponge, the latest hype for this new kind of makeup applicator comes courtesy of the Evie Blender , a glittery, squishy makeup sponge made from medical grade silicone.\nEvie Blender’s creator, Angie Johnson, is a makeup artist who wanted to create a makeup tool that wouldn’t waste product like other sponges tend to do. While regular makeup sponges are made from foam and absorb extra makeup, the Evie Blender only picks up the product you need . This is great news because it means we save money…only to spend on more beauty products!\nWhen we first heard about the Evie Blender, it had just launched its Kickstarter . They have since surpassed their goal of $28K by more than $16K, in less than a week. Right now you can get either holographic silver glitter or purple glitter, but they plan on adding more colors later.\nWe were able to get our hands on the Evie Blender to try it ourselves. Jordan McKittrick / www.facebook.com We love how it doesn’t waste makeup. Jordan McKittrick / www.facebook.com It won’t hold on to old makeup residue, which means it is safer for your skin.\nAnd it’s so easy to clean. Use a makeup wipe in a pinch. Jordan McKittrick / www.facebook.com The Evie Blender can last more than a year if cared for properly.\nPlus, it’s SO cute! Jordan McKittrick / www.facebook.com Watch the entire video here:\n\nJohnson told HelloGiggles that she came up with the name Evie because it is kind of a nickname for her parent company, Evolution Beauty LLC.\nJohnson adds: “My goal is for it to be an innovative beauty tech company that is also environmentally and socially conscious.” \nHow do you guys feel about this new #purple #glitter #EvieBlender? I'm adding it today as an option to the #kickstarter because of all the love we've been getting Help us out and keep sharing so we can make our goal! #11daystogo \nA photo posted by Evie Blender (@evieblender) on Jan 8, 2017 at 11:25am PST \nDue to the success of the Evie Blender, Johnson is currently talking to a distributor and manufacturer to help with the orders. “I’m excited about it because it’s all female-owned and operated in the US,” she explained to us. Once the Evie officially launches, she also plans to have a portion of the proceeds to go to an environmental conservation charity. How cool is that?\nTHANK YOU! We did it. Goal reached! You will all be getting your Evie Blenders in March! To celebrate I dressed her up a bit ✨Stay tuned. I sent out samples to some amazing magazines and beauty bloggers. I'll regram them here #evieblender #grateful \nA photo posted by Evie Blender (@evieblender) on Jan 10, 2017 at 10:25pm PST \nThere’s still six days left on the Kickstarter, so you can order your own Evie Blender, here !
