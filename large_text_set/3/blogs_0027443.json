Representational image. Reuters \n\"There were 228 ceasefire violations at the LoC in 2016 and 221 at the IB (International Border). However, till February 2017, there have only been 22 ceasefire violations till now and six on the IB,\" he said while replying to the supplementaries in the Rajya Sabha. \nLeader of opposition and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad criticised the minister for not giving a proper reply and said he had never \"witnessed butchering\" of such an important issue during his 36 years of his Parliamentary career. \nHowever, Home Minister Rajnath Singh came to the rescue of his junior minister and rejected the charges of Azad saying that appropriate answer had been given to the question. \nHe read out a statement which was similar to a written reply given by Ahir in Lok Sabha on Wednesday which showed that terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir have come down after the surgical strikes were carried out by the Indian Army on terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. \nIn his reply, Ahir said that during the three months prior to the 29 September surgical strikes, there were 110 terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir in which 34 security personnel and seven civilians were killed. \nBut during three months, post-surgical strikes, there were 87 terror incidents in the state in which 19 security personnel and six civilians were killed, he said. \nThe surgical strikes were carried out by the army after the terror attack at in North Kashmir on 18 September last year in which 19 soldiers were killed. \nThe government had said that during the strikes, many terror launch pads were destroyed and several militants killed in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. \n\"The government has continuously encouraged to mainstream the youth, including providing employment opportunities to wean them away from militancy,\" Ahir said. \n 49  49 am Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:34:37.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
