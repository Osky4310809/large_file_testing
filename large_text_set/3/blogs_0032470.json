(You can scroll down for that explanation). \nIs nothing sacred anymore?! \nIn case you missed it: Krispy Kreme announced yesterday that they are changing their name to 'Krispy Cream' in the UK because Brits have trouble saying it. \nBut, alas, they're not. It was all a joke. The brand went as far as changing its logo and name on Twitter and its website - and bagging the www.krispyCream.co.uk domain to redirect to its site. \nIn a statement to Mirror Online, a spokesperon said: \"As you may have guessed by now, it was an April Foolâ€™s Day story and we will remain as Krispy Kreme within the UK. \n\"The idea behind the story was to draw attention to the confusion around pronunciation and spelling of the brand in a humorous, irreverent way. \n\"We know doughnuts are not a hot political issue at the moment, but we care about them a lot (!) and wanted to find an entertaining way of addressing the issue.
