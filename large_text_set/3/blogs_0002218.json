Yes, a bull rider. Now, that’s something new! \nFind the complete lineup of celebrity dancers and their pro dance partners below. \n— Official DWTS (@DancingABC) March 1, 2017 \nIn the days leading up to Wednesday’s big reveal, Buddy TV confirmed eight of the twelve couples who will be dancing this season and their prediction was 100 percent accurate. However, ABC managed to keep a few names under wraps and judging from the reaction on Twitter , Dancing with the Stars fans are excited about the lineup. \nHere’s the official Dancing with the Stars Season 24 cast lineup per Good Morning America , including the names of the pro that the celebrity will be dancing with. Bachelor Nation, are you ready to see @viallnicholas28 embark on a new journey with @PetaMurgatroyd to win the Mirrorball Trophy? \n— Official DWTS (@DancingABC) March 1, 2017 Bachelor star Nick Viall and pro Peta Murgatroyd (introduced from Los Angeles — Nick did not appear live on the show) Major League baseball player David Ross and pro Lindsay Arnold Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Erika Gerardi and pro Gleb Savchenko Saturday Night Live comedian Chris Kattan and pro Witney Carson Olympic gymnast Simone Biles and pro Sasha Farber Former Glee star Heather Morris and pro Maks Chmerkovskiy Actor and former wrestler Mr. T and pro Kym Johnson Professional bull rider Bonner Bolton and pro Sharna Burgess Music artist (Fifth Harmony) Normandi Kordei and pro Val Chmerkovskiy Former Jacksonville Jaguars running back Rashad Jennings and pro Emma Slater Actor, comedian, and guitarist Charo and pro Keo Motsepe Olympic skater Nancy Kerrigan and pro Artem Chigvintsev \nThere have been a number of negative tweets about Nick Viall, the Bachelor star who is just finishing up his fourth round of trying to find love on TV. And leave it to Nick, who follows in the footsteps of former Bachelor stars Chris Soules, Sean Lowe, and Jake Pavelka, to bring drama to what is normally a non-dramatic show. \nRadar Online reports that the 36-year-old former software salesman is being a bit of a diva on the Dancing with the Stars set. \n“The producers and other people on staff for DWTS are saying that Nick is one of the most arrogant and self-entitled people that they have ever had on the show. He was trying to negotiate a higher salary than anyone else since he also appears on The Bachelor .” \nHopefully, Nick’s rumored “nightmarish behavior” will stay behind the scenes. After all, most people tune in to watch DWTS because it is a positive and fun show to watch. \n— Good Morning America (@GMA) March 1, 2017 \nIn addition to Derek Hough, several pros are not returning to the dance floor this season including Cheryl Burke, Jenna Johnson, and Allison Holker who posted a long message on her Instagram account informing her fans that she will be “watching and voting for her favorites” and will keep everyone up to date on some “new ventures” she’s involved with. \nA post shared by Allison Holker (@allisonholker) on Feb 28, 2017 at 1:30pm PST \nJudges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli, and Carrie Ann Inaba will return to the show this season and fans can expect to see several celebrities serve as guest judges. \nWhat do you think about this season’s cast lineup? Sound off in the comments about your favorite dance partners. \nWatch the upcoming season of Dancing with the Stars starting with the March 20 premiere at 8 p.m. on ABC. \n[Featured Image by ABC Television Network]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T16:06:32.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
