The device is expected to be a modern take on the original, but it will remain a feature phone — not an Android-powered smartphone as some reports have recently suggested.\nReliable tipster Evan Blass first confirmed the Nokia 3310 was making a comeback, and he reported earlier this month that it would cost just €59 (approx. $63) in Europe. At that price, it was always highly unlikely that fans would be getting a big smartphone upgrade. Now a report out of China has confirmed it will remain a feature phone.\nThere will be some changes and improvements that make the Nokia 3310 a bit more modern, however. Sources for VTech claim the new handset will be thinner and lighter than its predecessor, while the size of its keys will be adjusted to make them even easier to use. It is also expected to get a larger color display, though the resolution won’t change much.\nIt’s thought Nokia and HMD want to focus on what made the original Nokia 3310 so popular — its durability and incredible battery life. Of course, no one is going to swap their iPhone or Android for the new 3310, so the new model at just $63 is designed to be a second phone that users can carry around or keep in their car to be used in emergencies.\nThe new 3310 is expected to come in black, blue, gray, red, green, and yellow. It’s not yet clear when it will go on sale, or which markets will get it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:15:34.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
