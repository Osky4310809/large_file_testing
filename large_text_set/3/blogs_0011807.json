Visit uno tomorrow ! Rams ? ü§îüò´üòÜüòè pic.twitter.com/kROKujKyJ0 \nLater that night, Hekker told Rams fans to show Webster some love. Then, this is what Hekker tweeted on Sunday night: \n‚ÄúGreat things about LA -the weather (went to the beach Christmas Day) -the food -the chance to play under Wade Phillips Boom!!‚Äù \nIt would make sense for the Rams to have expressed interest in Webster. They‚Äôre thin at cornerback and he played under Phillips in Denver last season. \nWebster was also captain of the special teams unit for the Broncos so it would make sense as to why Hekker would want him in Los Angeles. @kayvonwebster @sonofbum Gonna sell ketchup popsicles to people in white gloves. Haha enjoy the visit man. \n‚Äî Johnny Hekker (@JHekker) March 13, 2017 \nThe free agent noticed the pitch from Hekker and told him that he should be a ‚Äúsalesman‚Äù when he retires from being an NFL punter. \nHekker, in response, wished Webster well and told him about obscure plans for what he plans to sell ‚Äî which seems to be a more difficult pitch than the Rams.
