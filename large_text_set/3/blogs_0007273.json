We still have an amicable relationship with Top Rank. We're free to come back at anytime,” she continued. \nDonaire’s decision to leave the promotional company stemmed from the latter’s plan to pit the boxer against undefeated WBO featherweight champion Oscar Valdez in March. \nRachel said the date is too soon, but that they’re not completely shutting the door on the opportunity.   \n“Of course with (Oscar) Valdez there that's certainly an option, especially when Nonito tests the waters again at 126. As everyone knows Nonito couldn't make the March fight that Top Rank wanted to with Valdez. It was too close, we were told in January about that fight,\" she explained. \n“So what we ended up doing is telling them is, 'Hey, maybe let’s re-visit this later on down the road,'” added Rachel. \nDonaire hasn’t fought since losing his WBO junior featherweight title to Jessie Magdaleno in November last year. – Dino Maragay  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T09:58:37.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
