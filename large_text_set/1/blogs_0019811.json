The guy cut the best promo of the year — possibly of the last five years — and delivered the most consistently entertaining matches of anyone in the company not named “AJ Styles.” And of course, he also debuted the official Miz Participation Award , which he has bestowed upon pretty much everyone from Dean Ambrose on down to referees who are bad at fantasy football . \nWWE has proven over the past decade that if there’s anything you see on TV that you want, they’ll find a way to sell it to you. From WORLD’S GREATEST DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS mugs to asshole-themed cereal that you can eat with your real human mouth, they’re like a real-life and way less aggressive version of “ X Gon’ Give It To Ya .” So thanks to the WWE.com website , you can now have your very own Miz Participation Award. For free! Because you can download and print out as many as you want.\nWWE.com\nYou can find the high-resolution PDF of the Participation Award right here , suitable for printing, framing, making your desktop background, or just handing out to your friends and family as a way of making them laugh, angering them, and/or filling them with shame and regret for having made an effort.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T17:52:16.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
