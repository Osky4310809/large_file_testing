In the home office, you get to pick your office mates, and that’s a pretty sweet perk. That’s the situation that Michael Reegs found himself in. \nMichael runs the Accuride International Inc.’s Southeastern Sales Center, and he’s got two other teammates; Meeka and Kya. They’re the family dogs. 2 \nWorking remotely for the drawer slide manufacturer, Reeg relies on his dogs to keep him sane and to bounce ideas off of. This is why Meeka’s been the employee of the quarter, four times running. \nWhen he comes across a problem or needs to work on a sales pitch, he’ll try it out on Meeka and it’s her feedback that helps him determine which direction he should go in. \nTrue story. 3 \nIt might sound cheesy, but he looks forward to his work day because of the dogs, especially Meeka. It’s not easy to transition from working in a busy office, to getting yourself motivated to work in your quiet home. Meeka makes the workday more fun. \nEven if there’s a day he’s not in the office and is on the road instead, she’ll come into the office anyways. If the door is closed, she camps out in front of the door, just in case he’s really inside. \nIt’s this behaviour that made Michael decide to liven up his home office with some “Employee of the Quarter” signs. 4 \nWhen it comes to getting your ass in gear after waking up and walking 5 feet to the next room to get game face on and do your job, it really helps to have something to work for, to keep you sane. Which is why Meeka’s won the “Employee of the Quarter” award over Michael. 5 \nThe funny thing is that he’s actually shared these awards with his superiors at the corporate office of Accuride, and they fully support Reeg’s decision to give Meeka this honour. \nI mean, sure, it might be a joke and a way for a guy working from home to keep his sanity intact, but you can’t really understate the effect that a dog has on your well-being and mental health, especially when you’ve got a high stress job like corporate sales.
