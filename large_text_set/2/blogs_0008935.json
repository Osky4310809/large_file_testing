We should expect to see the next egg in 2-3 days. It will be exciting to watch the season in HD this year.” \nWATCH THE EAGLE CAMS: Harmar Eagle Cam \nOf course, this isn’t the first egg for the nesting pair in Hays. \nLast year, the eagles successfully raised two eaglets, which hatched in March and fledged in June . A third egg was not viable and never hatched. \nIn 2015, the eagles laid three eggs but none hatched. But, in 2014, the pair successfully raised three eaglets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:38:08.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
