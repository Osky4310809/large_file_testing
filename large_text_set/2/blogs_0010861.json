Zlatan is a beast, a machine – but he was next to another, smaller machine. \n“Ibrahimovic was too static, Messi needed more space. Zlatan took up too much of it. \n“There was a bit of friction, I think.” \nIbrahimovic left Barca to return to Italy with AC Milan, where he would spend two seasons before joining the ambitious project being pieced together at Paris Saint-Germain.
