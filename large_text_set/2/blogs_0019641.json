Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTottenham are set to move for Isco this summer with the Real Madrid playmaker finally ready to quit the Spanish giants. \nIsco, 24, laid on two assists last Saturday as Real beat Espanyol 2-0 at home. But he is considering his options at the Bernabeu as he is concerned at not starting enough games. \nIsco’s deal expires next year which means Real will have to sell him this summer - if he does not commit himself to a contract he has been offered - or risk losing him on a free transfer. \nEarlier this week Isco admitted he is weighing up his future. He said: “I’m calm. What worries me is to have minutes. A player’s career is small. \n“I’m happy here and would stay many more years. From now until the end of the season, we will make a decision. It is my future at stake.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:44:36.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
