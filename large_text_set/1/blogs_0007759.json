The feel-good romance, set in Los Angeles, succeeds both as a modern musical and as an affectionate tribute to Hollywood’s Fred ‘n’ Ginger-style classics. \nDoes the film’s success at one awards show foreshadow a similar haul at the Oscars? The Golden Globes split their awards into two categories, drama and comedy/musical. Prizes for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Actress are handed out in both groups. During the heyday of movie musicals in the 1960s, Golden Globe-winning films in the latter category regularly went on to triumph at the Academy Awards. But their popularity has waned, and in recent years few musical- or comedy-winners have been Best Picture contenders at the Oscars. In the current millennium, only “Chicago” and “The Artist”—itself a love-letter to another golden age of cinema, the silent movie—have won Best Picture for both the comedy/musical Golden Globe category and the Oscars. Surprisingly, although the Academy deemed “Birdman” the best film of 2014, it failed to win the corresponding Golden Globe in comedy/musical. \nOn the drama side, however, the two awards have been much more closely aligned of late. This is particularly true regarding acting performances: during the past six years, every single Oscar winner for both Best Actor and Best Actress also secured a Golden Globe (for drama in ten of the 12 cases). For Best Picture and Best Director, the Academy has opted for candidates that failed to win a Golden Globe about half the time. The only time an Oscar for Best Director has gone to the same Golden Globe victor for a musical (or comedy) was in 1965, when George Cukor won for “My Fair Lady”. Damien Chazelle will be hoping that the song and dance about “La La Land” is borne out on February 26th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:08:34.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
