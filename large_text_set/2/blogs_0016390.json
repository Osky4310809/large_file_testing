(Romain Maurice/Getty Images for /sedmak/iStock/Getty)  37 PM \nSammy Sosa still believes he’s a savior. \nThe disgraced baseball icon continues to deny he took performance-enhancing drugs during his MLB career, suggesting he was wrongly targeted, like Jesus was. \n“It's like Jesus Christ when he came to Jerusalem. Everybody thought Jesus Christ was a witch, and he was our savior,” Sosa laughingly told former Cubs media relations employee Chuck Wasserstrom for his blog . “So if they talk s--t about Jesus Christ, what about me? Are you kidding me?” \nSosa never walked on water, but he did crush a ton of baseballs during his 18-year career which he spent mostly in Chicago. \nJose Canseco is right: Induct all, or none, into Hall of Fame \nThe slugger was traded by the Cubs after the 2004 season. Sosa said he never wanted to leave and claimed he was responsible for the Cubs' popularity. \n“I have my pride, and I know I had a tremendous career in Chicago,” Sosa said. “When nobody knew who Chicago was, I put Chicago on the map. Like you said, if I could have done it again, I would have done it differently.” Sammy Sosa spent 13 years of his career with the Chicago Cubs, where he was one of the best sluggers in the game. (JACK DEMPSEY/Associated Press) \nIf asked back by the Cubs, Sosa would “never say no,” he said. He feels he owes the people of Chicago, but it’s going to take the reigning World Series champs to reach out to him because he has “too much pride” to extend an olive branch. \nAs for the ongoing steroid allegations, Sosa says there’s no concrete evidence. \nJeff Bagwell dances around PED issue after being voted into Hall \n“A lot of people say so many things, but I'm telling you — they have nothing on me,” Sosa said. “I'm not going to go out there begging, because they have no case. They had the Mitchell report trying to find something, but they had nothing on Mr. Sosa.” \nIn the late ‘90s and early 2000s, Sosa was one of the best hitters in the game. He belted over 60 home runs in three out of four seasons from 1998-2001 and finished his career with 609 dingers. \nHowever, his career was forever tarnished due to rumors about steroid use. He was also caught using a corked bat in 2003. Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:13:28.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
