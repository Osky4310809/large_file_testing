Mata breaks the deadlock (Photo: Matthew Peters) \nUnited huffed and puffed at Rostov’s massed yellow ranks and went close when Marcos Rojo got his head to Blind’s corner, forcing Nikita Medvedev into a decent save. \nThe Rostov keeper parried Rojo’s header and Zlatan Ibrahimovic hit the post from the rebound. \nMedvedev caused panic in the Rostov defence when he rushed out to challenge Ibrahimovic and the Swede rounded him, only to loft his effort over the bar from a narrow angle. The erratic Medvedev was fortunate not to concede a penalty when he pushed Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the back challenging for a high ball. \nUnited were getting closer and Ibrahimovic cut inside before hitting a right-foot shot against the post with Medvedev beaten. Somehow Rostov managed to withstand this siege.

Pogba had been quiet, but came to life just before half-time when he hit a left-foot curler, which was saved by Medvedev. \nBut he was forced off with a suspected pull to his right hamstring. \nRostov’s game plan was to defend in numbers and hit United on the break. \nAnd it nearly brought them the opening goal when Sardar Azmoun, dubbed the ‘Iranian Messi’, cut inside Rojo and hit a left-foot shot, which Romero pushed away. \nRomero also saved from Christian Noboa and Rostov grew in confidence.
