Close share panel Media caption Kim Leadbeater, Jo Cox's sister, tells Radio 4â€™s Today about how she wants to 'eradicate' loneliness Colleagues and family members of the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox have launched a campaign to tackle loneliness . \nMrs Cox had started work on the cross-party campaign before she was killed in her constituency last year. \nThe commission, in her memory, will work with 13 charities including Age UK and Action for Children to come up with ideas for change. \nThey will provide findings as part of monthly campaigns on people such as new mums, carers and the elderly. \n'Sociable but lonely' - how it feels when loneliness strikes \nThe campaigners will put together a manifesto of the charities' findings and ask the government to look into ways of reducing the problem. \nResearch by the partners shows over nine million people say they are \"always or often lonely\", but two-thirds of those would not talk about it in public. 'Real difference' \nMPs want the report to be a call to action to encourage people to chat and start conversations. The commission is asking people to do more, for example knocking on a door or picking up a phone. \nMrs Cox's sister, Kim Leadbeater, said she wanted to continue the MP's legacy \"by ridding society of loneliness one conversation at a time.\" \nThe Labour MP suffered from loneliness when she went to university and was split up from her sister. \n\"It was one of those issues where she felt she could make a real difference,\" she told the BBC News Channel. \n\"I can't go back to normality because there is no normality without Jo, but what I can do is try and work to continue the good stuff that she did and try and make her proud.\" \nDespite the family's \"dark days\", Ms Leadbeater said she would not be beaten by what had happened and that she would \"come out fighting\". \n\"I'm going to try and make some of the change and difference Jo can't make for herself anymore\", she added. \nThe co-chairwoman of the campaign, Conservative MP Seema Kennedy, said loneliness could be \"profoundly detrimental\" on mental and physical health. \n\"If you are chronically lonely, it is as bad as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. You might have an increased risk of high blood pressure.\" \nMrs Cox was determined to shine a spotlight on how loneliness affects people of ages, Ms Kennedy said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T14:30:55.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
