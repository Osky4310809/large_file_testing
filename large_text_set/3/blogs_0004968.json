Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFirms humiliated by the government for not paying minimum wage secretly underpaid more than 30,000 workers by a further £1.8m. \nThe figures have been revealed after Tory ministers \"named and shamed\" 556 firms for paying their employees less than the legal rate. \nAt the time the government trumped how the firms had collectively owed £1.4million to more than 17,000 workers. \nNow it admits 82 of those \"named and shamed\" firms underpaid a further £1.8million to 32,070 employees. \nBut ministers are refusing to say who the firms were - despite claiming the naming scheme ensures \"abuses will not go unpunished\".

Green co-leader Caroline Lucas said the new tally was \"utterly unacceptable\" (Photo: Getty) \nThe first tranche of 197 firms were named for underpaying more than 1,600 workers to the tune of £465,291 - you can see the full list here. \nMinisters now say 22 of them repaid a further £410,967 in \"self-correction\" arrears to 1,574 workers. \nThe second tranche of 359 firms were named for underpaying 15,520 workers to the tune of £995,233 - you can see the full list here. \nMinisters now say 60 of them repaid a further £1,435,419 in \"self-correction\" arrears to 30,946 workers. \nSince 2013 the government has named and shamed nearly all firms issued with a formal Notice of Underpayment (NOU), which carries penalties worth twice the unpaid wages up to £20,000 per worker. \nBut government policy says firms can avoid receiving a NOU for wages that they \"self-correct\" through their own systems. \nIn some cases a NOU may be issued for a small portion of underpaid wages, and a firm is then expected to \"self-correct\" the rest. \n\"In all cases of self-correction HMRC ensures that the workers receive the money they are due,\" the policy document says. \nIn January the Mirror revealed how not one of 700 firms named and shamed between 2013 and 2016 had been prosecuted. \nLabour peer Lord Beecham said at the time: \"What a contrast between the approach to employers breaking the law and exploiting their workers and the sanctions regime applied ruthlessly to benefit claimants.\" \nMs Lucas said \"the worst offenders should certainly face criminal prosecution\", but added: \"The key is getting workers the money they deserve\".

The Government is committed to making sure our economy works for everyone and that is why we are determined to further clamp down on bosses who short-change their workers. \n\"In all cases of self-correction HMRC will take action to ensure that workers receive the money they are legally entitled to.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T11:11:25.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
