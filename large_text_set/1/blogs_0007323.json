Most babies should start eating peanut-containing foods well before their first birthday, say guidelines released Thursday that aim to protect high-risk tots and other youngsters, too, from developing the dangerous food allergy. The new guidelines from the National Institutes of Health mark a shift in dietary advice, based on landmark research that found early exposure dramatically lowers a baby's chances of becoming allergic. (Carrie Stevenson via AP) \nNew guidelines say babies at high risk of developing a peanut allergy should be given peanuts around 6 months of age – a departure from the idea that they should be kept away from peanuts until they are 3 years old. \nThe guidelines were released Thursday by an expert panel convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The panel reviewed dozens of studies as well as the findings of a landmark clinical trial released in 2015 where researchers followed more than 600 infants at high risk for developing a peanut allergy. \nAfter five years, the researchers found, infants who regularly consumed peanut-containing foods early in life had reduced the risk of developing an allergy by 81 percent. \n“The magnitude of the benefit and the scientific strength of the study raised the need to operationalize these findings by developing clinical recommendations focused on peanut allergy prevention,” said Dr. Daniel Rotrosen, director of the institute’s allergy and immunology division. \nThe guidelines instruct health care providers how to introduce peanuts to infants at low, moderate and high risk of developing a peanut allergy. The risk levels are determined by a child’s eczema severity or egg allergy. Family history or a sibling with an allergy are not considered risk factors. \nParents should consult a health care provider such as a pediatrician or allergist about their risk level before including peanuts in a child’s diet. Whole peanuts should never be given to infants because of the risk of choking, and other solid food should be introduced first. \nGiving some babies peanuts may seem scary, but living with a peanut allergy is scarier. \nPeanut allergies can persist through adulthood. Reactions can range from mild to life-threatening. With peanut products in many foods, people with an allergy must be constantly aware of the contents in their food and environment, which can be extremely stressful for families. \n“Living with a peanut allergy requires constant vigilance. Preventing the development of peanut allergy will improve and save lives and lower health care costs,” said institute director Dr. Anthony Fauci. “We expect that widespread implementation of these guidelines by health providers will prevent the development of peanut allergy in many susceptible children and ultimately reduce the prevalence of peanut allergy in the U.S.” \nLila Kertz, a pediatric nurse practitioner at St. Louis Children’s Hospital, said the recommendation to delay the introduction of peanuts until the age of 3 dates to 2000, when experts thought that waiting would prevent the development of allergies. \nInstead, the prevalence of peanut allergies more than doubled. In 1999, 0.4 percent of children in the U.S. were affected by peanut allergies. By 2010, it was 2 percent, national surveys showed. \nIn 2008, the recommendation to wait until age 3 was dropped. The latest guidelines instruct providers on when to intentionally expose infants to peanuts to prevent an allergy. \n“It’s completely changed the way we are thinking about this,” Kertz said. “Studies have shown we were wrong for many years.” \nIntroducing peanuts to babies early and continuing regular exposure trains their immune systems to not dangerously overreact, she said. \nInfants are considered at high risk of developing a peanut allergy if they have severe eczema, an egg allergy or both. These babies should have peanut-containing foods as early as 4 to 6 months of age. A health care provider may want an allergy blood test or a skin prick test first. Depending on the results, the provider may recommend introducing peanuts at a doctor’s office or at home, watching for reactions such as vomiting, skin rashes or trouble breathing. \nModerate-risk babies with mild to moderate eczema may have peanut-containing food introduced around 6 months, but it is not necessary to introduce peanuts early. A health care provider can diagnose whether eczema is mild to moderate. \nFor low-risk infants with no eczema or any food allergy, parents can freely introduce foods containing peanuts into their child’s diet. \nKertz recommended Bamba, a corn puff made with peanuts, as a safe snack for infants and toddlers. \nMichele Munz • 314-340-8263", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T17:04:19.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
