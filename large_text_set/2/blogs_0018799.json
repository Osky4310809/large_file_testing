The star, who has the largest celebrity following on Instagram, recently shared some pretty cool news with her fans there and we love it. Pop star Selena Gomez had a paint color named after her , and the shade totally does her justice.\nIt’s no surprise to see celebs share their favorite products and companies on their social media, sometimes sponsored and sometimes just out of love, like Selena Gomez’s latest shout-out . We’re used to seeing makeup shout-outs, body and diet products, but not so sure we’ve seen a paint company given the stamp of celeb approval before. But Gomez’s nod makes total sense.\nA post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Feb 7, 2017 at 5:08pm PST \nPortola Paints & Glazes, an LA-based eco-friendly paint company, shared a photo of a brand-new color they have available being mixed up on Instagram named Revival, an homage to the 24-year-old pop star’s latest album.\nA post shared by Portola Paints & Glazes (@portolapaints) on Feb 15, 2017 at 12:14pm PST \n““Holler at my girl @selenagomez cause our new color Revival is lit,” they captioned the picture. Gomez likely gets so many mentions on social media without having time to reply or respond, but she did this time. The one of the co-founders of the paint company, Jamie Davis, is married to Gomez’s trainer, Amy Rossoff Davis, and she keeps her squad close.\nShe shared a photo to her ultra-popular Instagram page of showing Jamie hard at work with the caption, “Proud of my trainers husband cause he’s goals for real @amyrosoffdavis @portolapaints,” she captioned the photo.\nA post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Feb 15, 2017 at 12:25pm PST \nAccording to People , she’s not the only celeb to have endorsed the eco-friendly paint. The company confirmed to the magazine that Catt Sadler and Julianne Hough are official endorsers of the company, but we love they went the extra step for Gomez, because yes, that color is LIT!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:13:34.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
