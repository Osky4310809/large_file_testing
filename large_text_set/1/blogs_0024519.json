Jan 28th 2017 8:03PM \nBy David Ingram and Mica Rosenberg \nNEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - An initial volley in a potential barrage of legal challenges to President Donald Trump's new restrictions on immigration came on Saturday on behalf of two Iraqis with ties to U.S. security forces who were detained at New York's JFK Airport. \nIn a lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the men are challenging the directive on constitutional grounds. The suit says their connections to the American forces made them targets in their home country and the pair had valid visas to enter the United States. \nSee images from JFK Airport: 15 PHOTOS Scenes from JFK Airport after Trump ban See Gallery Scenes from JFK Airport after Trump ban Hossein Khoshbakhty wipes tears from his eyes while speaking during an interview about his Iranian brother, a U.S. Green Card holder effected by the travel ban at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 28, 2017.
