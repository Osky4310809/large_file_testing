The public outrage over what was seen as a botched rescue job by the government contributed to the recent ouster of Park Geun-hye as president. The sunken Sewol ferry is raised during its salvage operations on the sea off Jindo, South Korea, on March 23, 2017. Yonhap via Reuters \nWorkers on two barges began the salvaging operation Wednesday night, rolling up 66 cables connected to a frame of metal beams divers spent months putting beneath the ferry, which had been lying on its left side in about 40 meters (130 feet) of water. \nBy 3:45 a.m., Sewol's stabilizer surfaced from the water. About an hour later, the blue-and-white right side of ferry, rusty and scratched and its name \"SEWOL\" no longer visible from where it was, emerged for the first time in more than 1,000 days. \nBy about 7 a.m., the ferry had been raised enough for workers to climb on it and further fasten it to the barges.

The loading process, including emptying the ferry of water and fuel, is expected to take days. \nThe bodies of 295 passengers were recovered after the sinking on April 16, 2014, but nine are still missing . Relatives, some of whom who are watching from two fishing boats just outside the operation area, are hoping that those remains will be found inside the ferry. \n\"I can see it. I can see where my daughter is,\" Park Eun-mi, the mother of a missing 17-year-old girl, told a television crew as her boat approached the salvaging site on Wednesday. Lee Geum-hee, the mother of another missing student, said, \"We just want one thing — for the ship to be pulled up so that we can take our children home.\" The sunken Sewol ferry is raised during its salvage operations at the sea off Jindo, South Korea on March 23, 2017. News1 via Reuters \nOnce the ferry reaches a port 90 kilometers (55 miles) away in the city of Mokpo, in about two weeks, workers will begin clearing the mud and debris and search for the remains of the missing victims. An investigation committee will also be formed to search for clues that could further explain the cause of the sinking, which has been blamed on overloaded cargo, improper storage and other negligence. \nThe ferry's captain survived and is serving a life sentence after a court found him guilty of committing homicide through \"willful negligence\" because he fled the ship without issuing an evacuation order. \nPark was forced to defend herself against accusations that she was out of contact for several hours on the day of the sinking. The allegations were included in an impeachment bill lawmakers passed against Park in December, amid broader corruption suspicions.
