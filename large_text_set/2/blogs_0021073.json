This year, given that one of the movie’s nominated for Best Picture was a musical, there was also a chance to see some of our favorite musical movie moments brought to life on stage.\nKicking things off for the night was Justin Timberlake, who performed a mashup of his hit song “Can’t Stop The Feeling” from the Trolls movie soundtrack and Bill Withers’ “Lovely Day.”\nDuring his performance, Timberlake gave a shout out to Denzel Washington, and patted his former Mouseketeer buddy Ryan Gosling on the shoulder.\n#Oscars : @JTimberlake opens the show with 'Can't Stop the Feeling.' pic.twitter.com/Y3tOKUYZkh \n— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017 Introducing John Legend’s stunning medley of songs from La La Land were Legend’s cast mates, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.
