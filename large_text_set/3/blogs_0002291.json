The Lightning port itself will remain on the iPhone. \nA misinterpreted Wall Street Journal report suggested that Apple will ditch the Lightning port for USB-C, but as we pointed out , such a move, while welcome, would make little sense from Apple’s perspective. Lightning is slimmer than USB-C, Apple’s Lightning headphones and accessories will become redundant and Apple will lose the revenue it gets from licensing the port. \nIt does make sense that Apple replaces the older USB-A to Lightning cables for USB-C to Lightning ones. While faster than USB-A, USB-C’s main advantage is its enhanced power handling capabilities. \nApple has also ditched the USB-A ports on its refreshed MacBook lineup and left dedicated Apple users with no option but to purchase USB-C to USB-A adapters. \nThe iPhone maker is expected to ship three new phones later this year.\nNew iPads and a slightly refreshed Mac lineup is expected later this month.\nObviously, we would much prefer it if Apple did indeed adopt USB-C universally. Imagine a world where you only need one cable and one charger. That would be bliss. \nBut Apple will never have the courage to do something like that. \nThe post Apple’s Lightning port is here to stay, says analyst; new iPhones to support USB-C charging appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T06:25:04.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
