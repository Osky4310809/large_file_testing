It may be because of an abnormality in the emotional control mechanism which causes the brain to go into overdrive on hearing such trigger sounds, say researchers led by one of Indian-origin. \nThe findings showed that the brains of people with such condition -- known as misophonia or hatred of trigger sounds -- showed a physical difference in the frontal lobe between the cerebral hemispheres -- with higher myelination in the grey matter of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). “For many people with misophonia...for the first time we have demonstrated a difference in brain structure and function in sufferers,” said Sukhbinder Kumar at Newcastle University in Britain. Further, the study, published in the journal Current Biology, also showed abnormal connections between this frontal-lobe area and an area called the anterior insular cortex (AIC) -- known to be involved in processing emotions and integrating signals both from the body and outside world.

This will suggest therapeutic manipulations and encourage a search for similar mechanisms in other conditions associated with abnormal emotional reactions,” added Tim Griffiths, professor at Newcastle University. \nThe trigger sound was also found to evoke a heightened physiological response with increased heart rate and sweating in people with misophonia, the researchers noted. \nWatch: Why Do Some Noises Drive You Crazy? \nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:29:15.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
