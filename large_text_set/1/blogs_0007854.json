A few years ago, Kramer’s route took him past a house on Bluebell Avenue in Boulder for the first time and out came Tashi. \n“As fast as he could — which was not very fast — he ran up to me tail wagging, first day I met him,” Kramer said. “He’s just a really friendly dog. And I am a dog person, and they can tell.” \nA bond was formed and every day on his route, Kramer makes sure to stop and say hi to Tashi. \n“He would just come by every day and pet him,” said Tashi’s owner, Karen Dimetrosky. “Tashi would hang outside and would always get so excited when Jeff came. He would always try to pull me towards the mail truck.” \nBut at 14 years old, earlier this year Tashi became unable to walk up and down the steps of the porch. \n“We were literally carrying him up and down the stairs,” Dimetrosky said. “And he weighs about 70 pounds.” \nSo Kramer went from mailman to handyman a few months ago and built a ramp for that now allows Tashi to go in and out of the house at his own leisure. \n“It’s incredible,” Dimetrosky said. “I can’t imagine not having the ramp now. It’s the only way he gets in and out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T00:43:18.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
