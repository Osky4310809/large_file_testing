He jokingly said, “I’m here to receive your signature. I got caught on the way here by reporters.” It seems that he was also embarrassed though, as he quickly ran away after completing his event. \nWatch the adorable scene below (and try not to squeal)!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T15:46:41.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
