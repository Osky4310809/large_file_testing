According to Mr. Wheeler’s cached biography on the website of his former law firm, he has extensive experience defending schools and municipalities against employment discrimination lawsuits. The other deputy, John M. Gore, helped with his law firm’s defense of several states’ redistricting plans , and was among the lawyers who represented Florida when it was sued over a disputed attempt to purge its voter rolls close to an election. He also sought to get the University of North Carolina dropped from a lawsuit challenging a state law barring transgender students from using bathrooms that correspond with their gender identities. Ms. Clarke expressed “concerns” about both men and sought to link the delayed hearings to Mr. Trump’s baseless claim at a meeting on Monday with congressional leaders that millions of unauthorized immigrants illegally voted for Hillary Clinton in November’s election. She called that claim “an invitation for voter suppression tactics to be put on the books.” \n  Her attack came as Democrats forced a one-week delay on a Senate Judiciary Committee vote on Mr. Sessions’s confirmation. Ultimately, Mr. Sessions appears almost certain to be confirmed by the Senate, where he has served as a Republican from Alabama since 1997. Democrats have made Mr. Sessions’s civil rights record in Alabama and Washington one of their main points of attack , reviving questions that have dogged him for 30 years about his racial attitudes and his handling of civil rights litigation. Mr. Sessions, in hundreds of pages of written answers released this week by the Judiciary Committee, often gave measured and carefully worded statements about his views on civil rights and revealed few details about the course he would take as attorney general. Over and over, Mr. Sessions wrote that he would be “vigilant in the full enforcement of all federal laws” — including hate crime measures and civil rights legislation that he opposed in the Senate. Mr. Sessions broke with Mr. Trump over the president’s recent Twitter attack on Representative John Lewis , a Georgia Democrat, after Mr. Lewis said he did not consider him a legitimate president. Asked whether he agreed with Mr. Trump that the congressman was “all talk, talk, talk,” Mr. Sessions wrote that Mr. Lewis “was a key figure in the civil rights movement and has my utmost respect.” Mr. Sessions paid homage to the civil rights movement in his home state and said the Justice Department has “a clear role to play in remedying” inequality that persists in how laws are enforced. He is also attracting support from a Republican organization that is airing television ads in the Washington area calling him a “civil rights champion” and urging people to back his nomination. (One photo features him with Mr. Lewis.) The ads are sponsored by 45Committee, a tax-exempt group that can accept unlimited contributions without disclosing donors. The committee is linked to Todd Ricketts , a co-owner of the Chicago Cubs and Mr. Trump’s pick for deputy commerce secretary. \nGet politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .
