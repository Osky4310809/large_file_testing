Alongside compatriot Kante, he could help give Chelsea perhaps the most robust midfield pairing in the Premier League, but Monaco's resistance to losing all of their best players could prevent the deal happening in the immediate future. Nigel Roddis/Getty Images Meanwhile, per Metro 's Tom Olver , Burnley defender Michael Keane is concentrating on the remainder of the season with the Clarets rather than a possible move to Chelsea or Liverpool in the summer: \nIt’s flattering [to be linked], but I'm focused on Burnley. \nWe've got nine games left in the season and we need to make sure we remain in the league.

Chelsea's defence is already the meanest in the top flight alongside Tottenham Hotspur , but Keane could make for a strong long-term replacement for Gary Cahill.
