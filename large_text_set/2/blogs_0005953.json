When the word is \" derivatives ,\" most people are lucky if they can conjure up anything but an indistinct fog. \nDerivatives are generally placed in the realm of advanced or technical investing, but there is no reason why they should remain a mystery to common investors. This article will use a simple story of a fictional farm to explore the mechanics of derivatives . The Definition \nDerivatives are financial products with value that stems from an underlying asset or set of assets. These can be stocks, debt issues or almost anything. A derivative's value is based on an asset , but ownership of a derivative doesn't mean ownership of the asset. We will look at some examples. The Future of Healthy Hen Farms \nGail, the owner of Healthy Hen Farms, is worried about the volatility of the chicken market, with all the sporadic reports of bird flu coming out of the east. Gail wants a way to protect her business against another spell of bad news. Gail meets with an investor who enters into a futures contract with her. \nThe investor agrees to pay $30 per bird when the birds are ready for slaughter in six months' time, regardless of the market price . If, at that time, the price is above $30, the investor will get the benefit as he or she will be able to buy the birds for less than market cost and sell them on the market at a higher price for a gain. \nIf the price goes below $30, then Gail will get the benefit because she will be able to sell her birds for more than the current market price, or more than what she would get for the birds in the open market . \nBy entering into a futures contract , Gail is protected from price changes in the market, as she has locked in a price of $30 per bird. She may lose out if the price flies up to $50 per bird on a mad cow scare, but she will be protected if the price falls to $10 on news of a bird flu outbreak. \nBy hedging with a futures contract , Gail is able to focus on her business and limit her worry about price fluctuations. Swapping \nGail has decided that it's time to take Healthy Hen Farms to the next level. She has already acquired all the smaller farms near her and is looking at opening her own processing plant. She tries to get more financing, but the lender , Lenny, rejects her. \nThe reason is that Gail financed her takeovers of the other farms through a massive variable-rate loan, and Lenny is worried that if interest rates rise, Gail won't be able to pay her debts. He tells Gail that he will only lend to her if she can convert the loan to a fixed-rate . Unfortunately, her other lenders refuse to change her current loan terms because they are hoping interest rates will increase too. \nGail gets a lucky break when she meets Sam, the owner of a chain of restaurants. Sam has a fixed-rate loan about the same size as Gail's and he wants to convert it to a variable-rate loan because he hopes interest rates will decline in the future. \nFor similar reasons, Sam's lenders won't change the terms of the loan. Gail and Sam decide to swap loans. They work out a deal in which Gail's payments go toward Sam's loan and his payments go toward Gail's loan. Although the names on the loans haven't changed, their contract allows them both to get the type of loan they want . \nThis is a bit risky for both of them because if one of them defaults or goes bankrupt, the other will be snapped back into his or her old loan, which may require a payment for which either Gail of Sam may be unprepared. However, it allows them to modify their loans to meet their individual needs. Buying Debt \nLenny, Gail's financier, ponies up the additional capital at a favorable interest rate and Gail goes away happy. Lenny is pleased as well, because his money is out there getting a return, but he is also a little worried that Sam or Gail may fail in their business. \nTo make matters worse, Lenny's friend Dale comes to him asking for money to start his own film company. Lenny knows Dale has a lot of collateral and that the loan would be at a higher interest rate because of the more volatile nature of the movie industry, so he's kicking himself for loaning all of his capital to Gail. \nFortunately for Lenny, derivatives offer another solution. Lenny spins Gail's loan into a credit derivative and sells it to a speculator at a discount to the true value. Although Lenny doesn't see the full return on the loan, he gets his capital back and can issue it out again to his friend Dale. \nLenny likes this system so much that he continues to spin out his loans as credit derivatives, taking modest returns in exchange for less risk of default and more liquidity . Options \nYears later, Healthy Hen Farms is a publicly-traded corporation (the ticker symbol is obviously HEN) and is America's largest poultry producer. Gail and Sam are both looking forward to retirement. \nOver the years, Sam bought quite a few shares of HEN. In fact, he has more than $100,000 invested in the company. Sam is getting nervous because he is worried that another shock, perhaps another case of bird flu, might wipe out a huge chunk of his retirement money. Sam starts looking for someone to take the risk off his shoulders. Lenny, financier extraordinaire and an active writer of options, agrees to give him a hand. \nLenny outlines a deal in which Sam pays Lenny a fee for the right (but not the obligation) to sell Lenny the HEN shares in a year's time at their current price of $25 per share. If the share prices plummet, Lenny protects Sam from the loss of his retirement savings. \nLenny is OK because he has been collecting the fees and can handle the risk. This is called a put option , but it can be done in reverse by someone agreeing to buy a stock in the future at a fixed price (called a call option ). The Bottom Line \nHealthy Hen Farms remains stable until Sam and Gail have both pulled their money out for retirement. Lenny profits from the fees and his booming trade as a financier. \nIn this ideal tale, you can see how derivatives can move risk (and the accompanying rewards) from the risk averse to the risk seekers . Although Warren Buffett once called derivatives \"financial weapons of mass destruction,\" derivatives can be very useful tools, provided they are used properly. Like all other financial instruments , derivatives have their own set of pros and cons, but they also hold unique potential to enhance the functionality of the overall financial system .
