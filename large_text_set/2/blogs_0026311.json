But how often do job resignation letters go viral? Hardly ever! \nHowever, one fed up ex-employee out there is looking to change that or so it seems. Redditor Girlofgodsbadday shared a hilarious photo of her husband’s resignation letter after he quit his job. \nLet’s just say he might as well have just thrown a fucking printer at his boss. Giphy \nOnly, this wasn’t your average two weeks notice. This particular letter was written on a sheet of toilet paper. I guess he had a pretty crappy job! The letter reads, \nI have chosen this type of paper for my 2-week resignation as a symbol of how I feel this company has treated me, and ironically, how it is disposed of is where I feel the company is going. \nWell, DAMN. That tells us everything we need to know about how he really felt about his job. It seems like his employment there must have been a stinky situation. \nThe man ends the sentence-long resignation letter with a drawing of a toilet next to his signature. Behold the man’s two-week notice resignation letter written on a sheet of toilet paper. Take notes! Imgur \nThere you have it, folks. This guy firmly believes his ex-company is going straight down the drain. And if he’s bold enough to use two-ply toilet paper for his two-week notice, it probably is. \nSo far, the letter has been viewed over 500,000 times. I would advise all employers to tread lightly when treating employees like shit. Plenty of people now have this genius idea engraved in their memory FOREVER. \nSide note: Will someone please frame this at the MoMA?!
