(Photo: Getty Images) More Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump, according to Donald Trump . But as with many of the things that come out of his mouth, there are some people who aren’t buying it. And Wednesday’s press conference, the first major one the president-elect has held in 167 days , confirmed that to many in the anti-Trump camp. Trump held the presser to discuss how he plans to avoid conflicts of interest with his businesses and to field questions from reporters. But some people on social media were not pleased with the tone he used when speaking to some of the women who asked questions, and accused the president-elect of mansplaining. Of course Trump is berating and mansplaining and degrading a female reporter. \nWHY IS TRUMP SO CONDESCENDING TO THE WOMEN REPORTERS \nI HAVE AN IDEA \n— Tyler McCall (@eiffeltyler) January 11, 2017 \nStop #Mansplaining Trump- we understood what the papers were for, she did a great job explaining. \n— Megan Walters (@megwalters21) January 11, 2017 \nWomen, is this what Mansplaining feels like? \nI am SO sorry. \n— future ???? tense (@BlitzandGiggles) January 11, 2017 \nI believe this is the textbook definition of mansplaining. https://t.co/7EaPzm1hc0 \n— Lex Sant (@lexsant) January 11, 2017 Some also felt Trump unnecessarily mansplained attorney Sherri Dillon’s explanation on the papers Trump displayed onstage — papers he claimed are “just some of the many documents that I have signed turning over complete and total control [of my businesses] to my sons.” Dillon is the lawyer handling Trump’s conflict-of-interest matters, and she took the stage once the reporters began pelting the president-elect with questions. In her speech, she explained in depth how Trump plans to avoid such conflicts of interest. Later, when he returned to the stage to field more questions, Trump took the time to once again discuss the papers, saying that he was “not sure that was explained properly” by Dillon. As he re-explained it, “these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons.” Which caused more accusations of mansplaining. \nStop #Mansplaining Trump- we understood what the papers were for, she did a great job explaining. \n— Megan Walters (@megwalters21) January 11, 2017 One person joked that Trump’s explanation was unnecessary, as Dillon had already done the dirty work of informing the press about his plans. \nIs this lady proxy mansplaining for Trump? \n— Sarah Wingo (@SgWingo) January 11, 2017 Trump’s attitudes toward women have been a hot-button topic since the start of his campaign and may well continue throughout his presidency. He famously taunted Megyn Kelly after the GOP debate in August, came under fire after former Miss Universe Alicia Machado alleged that the now president-elect had disparaged her for her weight , and was accused by a Washington Post journalist of commenting on her appearance during an interview with the paper’s editorial board. Clearly, there are those who take issue with the way the future president interacts with women — something he might do well to consider in the future so as to avoid sparking even more controversy. What do you think? Is Trump guilty of mansplaining?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:12:15.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
