The two minute trailer has more meat and hoopla than the first trailer that was a launched a few months back. However, if you think you’ll get to see Priyanka Chopra in more screen time this time around you’ll surely be disappointed. Priyanka Chopra gets a dialogue and an introductory sentence from Dwayne Johnson but she appears so fleetingly in the trailer that you might just miss her if you blink. The entire trailer only features Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Zac Efron in either funny situation or doing some actions. \nThe film looks like a commercial potboiler. It has some drugs trafficking, some real estate scams, lots of skin and abs-showing scenes peppered with humour. Zac Efron seems to be playing the role of the handsome but funny sidekick whereas Dwayne Johnson is the man with a purpose and the action star. He projects a serious demeanor and opens the trailer with the line, “Welcome to Baywatch! Our team is the elite of the elite”. However, it is the miniscule screen time that Priyanka Chopra gets is the dampener here. Bollywood buffs were hoping that this second trailer would throw more light on her character of the main antagonist of the movie Victoria Leeds but the trailer disappoints once again. Whether it is a clearly though out strategy or she literally has a very small role in the movie that remains to be seen. \nThe trailer is funny with lots of situational jokes and Zac Efron is the one who is trying everyone to crack up with laughter. He even appears in drag in one of the scenes when Dwayne Johnson and he go undercover. The trailer is interesting and we hope that the movie lives up to the hype. \nWatch trailer here: \nThe movie Baywatch is based on the hugely successful television series of the same name that starred David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson . In this movie Dwayne Johnson plays devoted lifeguard Mitch Buchannon who has to keep aside his differences with a fresh recruit Matt Brody (played by Zac Efron) to stop a criminal plot. The film also stars Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach and is directed by Seth Gordon. Baywatch releases on May 26, 2017.
