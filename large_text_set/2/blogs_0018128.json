California State University wants students to participate in opportunities that support and further their academic success and the university will follow the law. CSU will encourage students to seek opportunities in states where travel is not prohibited,” California State University told TheDC. \nThe new law’s effects were felt by students at UC Davis, who planned on attending an undergraduate research conference in Tennessee. The new law prevented the students from attending because UC Davis was going to pay for them to go. \nMore than 100 Californians were chosen to be a part of the Council on Undergraduate Research Conference at the University of Memphis in April, but those who attend public universities will not receive funding to go. \nUC Davis students who were supposed to attend the conference responded to the new law. \n“I don’t want any funding on my behalf from the state, my parents or grandparents to go to a state like Tennessee that discriminates against LGBT people,” senior Acacia Keith told the Los Angeles Times. \nSenior Mark Rivera offered a different take on the situation. \n“Instead of discouraging travel to supposedly backward places, we should encourage travel; otherwise, campuses will become more insular and make the problem worse,” Rivera told the Los Angeles Times. \nThere are exceptions to the law however, which allow travel to these states if it was contracted before Jan. 1. \nUCLA’s football team is scheduled to play Memphis in September and Cal State Long Beach baseball will play North Carolina in March. After these visits, the universities will no longer be able to play games in these states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:42:04.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
