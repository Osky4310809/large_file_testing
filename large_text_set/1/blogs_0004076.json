For centuries artists have tried to capture the image of angels on canvas. \nSo what do angels look like? It may surprise you to know that the Bible describes angels nothing at all like they are typically depicted (you know, those cute little chubby babies with wings). This passage in Ezekiel 1:1-28 gives a brilliant description of four winged creatures. In Ezekiel 10:20 , we are told these angels are cherubim. \nMost angels in the Bible have the appearance and form of a man. Many of them have wings, but not all. Some are larger than life. Others have multiple faces that appear like a man from one angle, and a lion, ox, or eagle from another angle. Some angels are bright, shining, and fiery while others look like ordinary humans. Some angels are invisible, yet their presence is felt, and their voice is heard. 35 Facts About Angels in the Bible \nAngels are mentioned 273 times in the Bible.
