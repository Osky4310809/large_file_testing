Since we’re already so far into the season, we’ve capped prices at $100 — if you want to throw down a ton of money on investing in a new heavy jacket, best to do it at the beginning of the season so you can get the most out of it.\nInstead, these jackets will keep you warm enough in the coming days and serve you well through the beginning of spring. Take a look below and see if there’s anything you think would look good hanging in your closet.\nView As: One Page Slides REI REI REI made an affordable down jacket that can suit most warmth-related needs. It comes in a ton of different colors, so you can be as bright or as subdued with your look as you like.\nREI Co-op Down Jacket, $99.50, available at REI\nThe North Face Backcountry When it comes to keeping people warm, few brands are as trusted as The North Face. This zip-up fleece is a classic look that is finished with water-repellent coating to keep you both dry and comfortable.\nThe North Face Canyonwall Full-Zip Fleece Jacket, $98.95, available at Backcountry\nMountain Hardwear Backcountry A wind-resistant, soft-shell jacket, this look from Mountain Hardwear might be better suited for the spring weather, but if you’re worried about the freezing rain, this paired with some warm layering underneath will serve you well through March.\nMountain Hardwear Android II Softshell Jacket, $97.47, available at Backcountry\nColumbia Amazon This synthetic down puffer jacket from Columbia is a solid value for the price.\nColumbia Men's Frost-Fighter Puffer Jacket, $99.99, available at Amazon\nHippy Tree Backcountry This jacket from Hippy Tree might be my favorite on this list. I loved lined clothing, and the style is the type to make me feel like a true outdoorsman, even if I’ve only been in the woods twice in the past eight months.\nHippy Tree Pilsner Jacket, $76.96, available at Backcountry\nKUHL REI Another great rugged look, this jacket from KUHL is simple in its design, but big on comfort.\nKUHL Burr Jacket, $88.93, available at REI\nCarhartt Amazon Carhartt makes tough gear that I’ve come to believe can withstand almost any weather. This flannel-lined jacket provides enough insulation to keep you warm when the wind kicks in and is a great outer layer for when you know the night will be colder than the day.\nCarhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Sandstone Active Jacket, $86.09, available at Amazon\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
