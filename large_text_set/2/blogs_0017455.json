Carousel encourages users to provide their friends with a more complete picture of a particular experience by uploading up to 10 photos or videos in a single post that followers can in turn swipe through. The feature somewhat acts as an album of sorts, organizing various photos or videos around a given theme or occasion.\n“You no longer have to choose the single best photo or video from an experience you want to remember” Instagram insists, as the motive behind the update is to be more than a place where you “only get to see the highlights.”\nNow when posting, you can simply utilize a button that allows you to select more than one photo or video, as you can then edit each entry, choose the order of appearance, and still tag friends. One caption and location, in addition to the comments, will apply to the entire post.\nUpon sharing, your friends will be notified of a carousel post by a series of blue dots, alerting that it is indeed a carousel.\n“Share your favorite moments of your best friend’s surprise birthday party, from setting up to when they walk through the door. Or create a step-by-step cake recipe that people can always find on your profile,” says Instagram.\nThe feature will begin rolling out globally for both iOS and Android users over the next few weeks.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:22:27.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
