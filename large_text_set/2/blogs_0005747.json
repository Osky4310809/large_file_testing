King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 13 hours ago 8 \nGojira frontman Joe Duplantier said the band had outgrown its early death metal roots, stressing he can't understand what the big deal is, especially since the boys are still following their hearts. \nHe told Aggressive Tendencies : \"Yesterday at the show, a fan told me, 'Can I tell you something? I really love your band, but a lot of people think that you went mainstream.' \n\"And I wasn't sure what that meant, really. Did he mean, 'You're trying to make money, and you betrayed your fans,' or 'The music that you do organically is closer to a mainstream vibe.'? But I told him, 'I'm sorry for your friends that they're losing us like that, but we're just being ourselves and doing our thing, and it happens to attract more people, which is good for us.'\" \nFocusing on those death metal roots, Joe noted later during the chat: \"It's exactly like a friendship. You have a friend when you're a kid, and it's a friend that matters for life. You will always remember that friend, you still love that friend, but you moved to another city with your parents, so you don't see that friend anymore, but it's still part of your story, your structure, and without that friend you wouldn't be the same person. \n\"We still love death metal - it's part of us - and we don't feel like we turned our back on what we were. Our life was filled with death metal and that was our excitement at the time, and then we discovered new things and then we changed and then we grew up. Some elements are still there, but yeah, the music changed with us, and that's the beauty of doing this. Being a musician, it's like you're exploring.\" \nDiscussing extreme fan reactions to this state of affairs, the musician added: \"I never really quite understand why it's such a big deal to people when singers start to sing or when bands do different things. I can't understand it.\"All these conversations and discussions and questions, I'm like, 'What's the big deal?' We're rock bands. That's what we do. We do whatever the fuck we want, and people write about it like, 'Oh my God, they did that! And they never did it before!' For me, the essence of being in a rock band is to explore and do unexpected things and to be mean or to be super-sensitive or to be this or to be that - just be who you are. It's cool if people don't get it or are mad, but it's just such a great feeling to be able to interact with the world in this way. It's great.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:11:14.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
