The next step is function. \n\"If you understand the function you can identify abnormal function, then you have disease. \n\"Put them all together and you have the field of mesenteric science.\" Image copyright The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Coffey, J Image caption A digital representation of the small and large intestines and the mesentery \nHe said the mesentery should be now be investigated to the same degree as other organs and systems in the human body. \nAnd it could have a role to play in diseases such as colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and obesity. \nThe mesentery is a double fold of the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity, which attaches the stomach, small intestine, colon and other organs to the abdomen. \n\"When we approach it like every other organ, we can categorise abdominal disease in terms of this organ,\" Prof Coffey said.
