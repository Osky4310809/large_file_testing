Manigault was scheduled to speak about her role on the TLC reality show Say Yes to the Dress. According to the comedian, Manigault bailed at the last minute because the White House said her appearance could overshadow “the news of the day.” \nNoah said he was skeptical of Manigault’s explanation given that the news of the day was largely unfavorable to the Trump administration. He then proceeded to play a montage of footage from FBI Director James Comey’s testimony to the House Intelligence Committee. During the hearing, Comey confirmed that an FBI investigation of Trump’s Russian connections was ongoing and that the president’s wiretapping claims were spurious . \n“Wow, I did not see that coming,” Noah said sarcastically. “Is there like a thing for reverse mind blown?” \nNoah then mocked the president’s team, which began cherrypicking and tweeting out favorable clips from the hearing in real time. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:07:49.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
