Netflix confirmed the move in a statement Tuesday.\nUnder the new deal, Seinfeld will film two new stand-up specials exclusively for the streaming service, and will help develop scripted and unscripted comedy programming.\nHis show Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee , which launched in 2012 on Crackle, will also move to Netflix. Representatives for Crackle had no comment on the news.\nNetflix said 24 brand new episodes of the comedy series will premiere in installments globally on Netflix starting in 2017, with subsequent installments following in 2018 and beyond. Prior seasons of the series (59 existing episodes) will also become available exclusively on Netflix at the same time. \nSEE ALSO: Watch Rupert Grint, Ed Westwick in new trailer for Crackle's 'Snatch' \nGuests on the popular web series have included everyone from President Barack Obama to YouTube comedian Miranda Sings. \n\n\"When I first started thinking about Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee , the entire Netflix business model consisted of mailing out DVDs in envelopes. I love that we are now joining together, both at very different points,” Seinfeld said in a statement. “I am also very excited to be working with Ted Sarandos at Netflix, a guy and a place that not only have the same enthusiasm for the art of stand up comedy as I do, but the most amazing technology platform to deliver it in a way that has never existed before. I am really quite charged up to be moving there.\" \nThis is a big loss for Sony Pictures Television's free streaming service Crackle. Sony has spent the last year upping its slate for the service with a handful of originals including StartUp, which stars Martin Freeman and Adam Brody. \nComedians in Cars Getting Coffee has so far been the only one with notable critical acclaim. It was nominated for outstanding variety talk series at the Emmys, and the first six seasons garnered more than 100 million views.\nSeinfeld is now the latest comedian to be wooed by Netflix. \nLast year, Netflix announced that after an eight-year absence from doing stand-up, Chris Rock will tape two new specials that will debut on Netflix worldwide. \nThe streaming giant reportedly outbid HBO by dishing out a whopping $40 million to the comedian for the two specials.\nAmy Schumer will also debut her latest comedy special on Netflix March 7.\n“Jerry is known the world over as both a great TV innovator and beloved comic voice,” said Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer at Netflix, in a statement. “We are incredibly proud to welcome him to the Netflix comedy family.” \nBONUS: 'Seinfeld' with hamsters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:46:33.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
