Bournemouth’s Harry Arter thanks Pep Guardiola for ‘unbelievable’ gesture Read more \nThe club have not confirmed how long the player will be sidelined but there are fears he could be out for up to three months. \nA statement from the club read: “Manchester City can confirm Gabriel Jesus suffered a fractured metatarsal during the 2-0 win over Bournemouth on Monday night. He will undergo further examinations in the coming days to establish the extent of his lay-off.” \nThe news is a blow for City, who face Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday before resuming their Champions League campaign against Monaco. The Ligue 1 leaders visit the Etihad Stadium for the first leg of their last-16 tie on 21 February. \nJesus has made an immediate impact at City after joining the club in a £27m deal from Palmeiras in January. Leroy Sané sparkles for Manchester City as attacking trident shows menace | Ben Fisher Read more \nHe has scored three goals in his five appearances, including an injury-time winner against Swansea , and so impressive were his performances he was being selected ahead of top scorer Sergio Agüero. That situation had sparked fresh speculation over the future of Agüero, who has scored 154 goals for City since joining the club in 2011. \nAgüero replaced Jesus at the Vitality Stadium and forced the Tyrone Mings own goal which saw City complete their 2-0 victory and move to second in the Premier League. The Argentina international is now likely to continue leading the line, although City are not in Premier League action again until 5 March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:12:36.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
