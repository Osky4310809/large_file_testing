It's actually formed by a tequila-based mist held together by a plastic container to help it keep its fluffy cloud shape. According to The Huffington Post , the LAPIZ team used ultrasonic humidifiers to \"vibrate\" the tequila at a rate that turns the alcohol into a visible mist that is filtered into the container.\n#tequilacloud Serving free shots of delicious Silver Tequila since 2016.

It was also synched with the local weather patterns so when it rained in Berlin, the tequila poured down, too.\nDrinkers can hold their glasses under the cloud for an alcoholic rain shower shot. If that seems like too much work to get your buzz, there is a spout beneath the cloud for anyone who doesn't want to wait for the storm.\nA post shared by p√∏j p√∏j (@pojpojberlin) on Mar 8, 2017 at 9:07am PST\nA post shared by Cristina Zambet (@cristinazambet) on Mar 11, 2017 at 1:17pm PST\nWe predict that we'll see this cool cloud trick tried by amateur bartenders everywhere before your next crawl.\nIt's 5 o'clock somewhere and it might just be in the clouds.\n[H/T: The Huffington Post ]\nWATCH: The Raindrop Cake is back and this time it's a bright shade of purple", "external_links": ["http://www.urbanspree.com/event/tequila-cloud/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRdnVw3j2bD/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cloud-that-rains-tequila_us_58d1e2cae4b02d33b746c510", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9oV3N9PXvt9J6alfTzG832q1cFg=/http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fthumbs%2FfMCOLCQA.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRa17gCjyiW/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/fMCOLCQA.m3u8", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRYoqbojgU0/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRgzv6aA7WY/"], "published": "2017-03-29T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:22:26.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
