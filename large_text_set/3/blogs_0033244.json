Sakshi took to twitter to draw Prasad’s attention after a volunteer of the Common Service Centre involved in Aadhaar implementation tweeted his picture with Dhoni along with a screenshot of the cricketer’s Aadhaar page.\n“Dhoni is not just big cricketer but an equally big national hero. I admire him for getting his Aadhaar through Common Service Centre (CSC). I came to know that the volunteer was overawed by Dhoni’s presence and out of excitement he tweeted the picture. But no personal details have been revealed,” Prasad told media persons here. “I have asked the CSC to ensure such things are not repeated. I assure all that Aadhaar is safe and secure. No personal details will be be revealed,” added Prasad.\nIn a series of tweets, Sakshi had expressed her displeasure over the personal information being made “public property” and wondered “Is there any privacy left”. Replying to Sakshi’s Tuesday tweets, Prasad had promised action in the matter. “Thanks for bringing this to my notice. Sharing personal information is illegal. Serious action will be taken against this,” he had tweeted.\n \nThe post Aadhaar is secure says IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad after MS Dhoni’s card details leak on Twitter appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:39:11.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
