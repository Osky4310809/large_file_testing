Williams reached a buyout agreement with the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday and cleared waivers Saturday. The free agent considered joining the Cavaliers and Utah Jazz in recent days, but committed to Cleveland on Saturday, league sources said. \nThe Utah Jazz selected Williams with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2005 Draft. For a few years, he was considered on the same level as the likes of Chris Paul and Tony Parker. A falling out in Utah led to a trade to the Nets, and Williams never reached that same level again. \nThe Cavaliers wouldn’t expect the 32-year-old Williams to lead them to the Finals, though. They simply need someone to take some of the playmaking burden away from LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, and Williams is perfect for that role. \nCleveland also hopes to add 2015 NBA champion Andrew Bogut after the Mavericks traded the big man to the Philadelphia 76ers ahead of Thursday’s deadline. The Sixers are expected to buy out his contract this week. \nAdding Williams and Bogut could pull the Cavaliers even with the Warriors, as FOX Sports NBA analyst Chris Broussard argued on Friday’s episode of FS1’s “Undisputed .” While Golden State is still the more talented team, Cleveland’s depth will be an issue for the Warriors. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:10:27.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
