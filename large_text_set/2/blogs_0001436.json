Jon came out with a ridiculously long tie and a dead animal on his head. When Stephen asked him why he was wearing those things, Jon said, “The president sets men’s fashion, and I saw the inauguration… super-long tie, dead animal on head, boom!” Although, Jon wasn’t just there to show off his new fashion choices, he also claimed that he had the next executive orders that President Trump was preparing to sign. The first one Jon read was, “I, Donald J. Jonah Jameson Trump, hereby direct that, to secure our border, China shall immediately, and without hesitation, send us their wall. Done!” Jon went on a read a few more orders, and by the end of it he was exhausted. Jon said, “The presidency is supposed to age the president, not the public!” The Late Show With Stephen Colbert airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. on CBS.
