She was last seen in Himesh Reshammiya ‘s song Trippy , and her look garnered her much appreciation and love. Following which, she was contacted by a slimming pills company to endorse them for a ginormous amount. \nWalsucha, who believes in fitness and living holistically declined the offer without thinking twice. She believes there’s no shortcut to handwork and also added, \nI don’t believe in or encourage fad diets or pills for weight loss. In fact I don’t even believe in protein shakes or supplements. I stay away from anything processed.
