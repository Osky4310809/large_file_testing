However, Jung says it all started when the vehicle came up behind him at the stop light. \n\"He pushes on the gas and drives into my legs, and I go, 'Are you crazy?'\" Jung told CTV Ottawa on Monday. \"And then he does it again. He drives into me, and I'm shocked, and he continues doing it again and again, as the video shows.\" \nJung says the driver eventually got out and threw his bike to the curb. Witnesses told CTV Ottawa the same thing, although that moment was not captured on camera. \nJung claims the driver approached him a second time after throwing the bike, to demand that he move. \"I said, 'No, no, you need to stay here,' and he slapped me across the face,\" Jung said. \nPolice were called to the scene but opted not to press any charges. \nOttawa police Const. Chuck Benoit called the incident a verbal argument. \n\"There's discretion not to charge because it's two consenting adults in a wrong situation,\" he told CTV Ottawa. \nWith files from CTV Ottawa Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T15:28:35.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
