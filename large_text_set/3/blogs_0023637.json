The Mancunian withstood spiteful combinations from Linares \nCrolla bravely edged forward, trying to slow Linares with body shots, but the Venezuelan countered him with spiteful combinations. \nThese slashing punches from Linares soon took their toll on Crolla, who sustained a cut over his left eye after a big right hand in the sixth. \nLinares took full advantage of his injured foe in the seventh, uncorking an uppercut which Crolla failed to see until he crumpled to the canvas. Crolla bravely fought back after being knocked down in the seventh round \nBut the Manchester man clambered to his feet and staged a determined response in the eighth to spark roars of approval from his fans. \nAs his name was chorused, Crolla courageously fired back with right hands in the ninth, but his trainer Joe Gallagher appeared ready to call off this gallant effort after Linares landed his hurtful uppercut again in the 11th. \nCrolla did come out for the final round and deservedly heard the last bell, although Linares would celebrate a dominant win.
