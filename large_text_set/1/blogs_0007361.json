She said she is concerned that whoever released the video did it to make money.\nTMZ.com frame of Esteban Santiago TMZ.com / Sun Sentinel A frame from a video obtained by TMZ.com that appears to show alleged gunman Esteban Santiago opening fire at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport -- and Broward officials want to know who leaked it.

Photo via TMZ.com (TMZ.com / Sun Sentinel) \"Nobody gives TMZ a video for free. You ever heard of that?\" Sharief said.\nA February expose by the New Yorker magazine revealed how TMZ pays thousands of dollars to land exclusives, going as high as $80,000 for footage of a 15-year-old Justin Bieber using the N-word while singing “One Less Lonely Girl\" a cappella.\nThe Sun Sentinel and other traditional journalism sites do not pay sources for video or information.\nSharief said it's a crime to copy the airport video without authorization and she expects the investigation to wrap up in the near future.\n\"What we were trying to prevent by not releasing that video was copycats,\" Sharief said. Baggage claim areas are not \"the most heavily guarded areas\" and officials don't want to give ideas to anyone else who might want to do harm, she said.\nBroward Sheriff Scott Israel told the Sun Sentinel on Sunday that he had no comment on the TMZ video.\nIsrael said the FBI is leading the investigation. \"Anything that’s released or not released will be up to the FBI,\" Israel said.\nFBI officials said they were aware of the video but were not prepared to confirm or deny its authenticity.\nTMZ posted the video but did not respond to an email from the Sun Sentinel about how it obtained it.\nlbarszewski@sun-sentinel.com or 954-356-4556\n Esteban Santiago Fort Lauderdale Airport Shooting", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-587282f7/turbine/sfl-tmz-video-footage-fort-lauderdale-airport-20170108", "http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/inside-harvey-levins-tmz", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58709d2b/turbine/sfl-shots-fired-at-fort-lauderdale-international-airport-pictures-20170106", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5872ccac/turbine/sfl-sfl-tmz-video-footage-photo-fl0045921957-20170108", "http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/08/ft-lauderdale-shooting-first-shots-video/"], "published": "2017-01-09T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T09:17:12.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
