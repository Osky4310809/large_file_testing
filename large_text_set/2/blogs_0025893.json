Now that a market leader such as Coca-Cola has come to this understanding, others will follow.” \nCoca-Cola’s announcement surprised many, coming after reports that the company was trying to fight proposals for a recycling trial in Scotland. But the firm could be responding to public feeling on the issue, and continental trends. Estonia’s recycling success \nEuropean countries like Estonia – which started a bottle deposit scheme in 2005 – have reported dramatic results. \nThe Baltic state has a population of only 1.3 million people but collected and recycled 3.2bn “deposit packages” in the last 12 years. Last year, the return rate was 75% for cans, and 87% for both PET bottles and one-way glass.

Refilling systems leave the smallest environmental footprint, allowing shoppers to return robust bottles and cans to the manufacturer, usually for a deposit, so that each can be cleaned, refilled and reused up to 50 times. \nOne-way deposit schemes are similar but target single-use drinks containers, which the manufacturer can process, recycle and resell as new bottles, albeit after an energy intensive production process. \nSome initiatives use no deposit and operate on a voluntary basis only, but experts say they offer little incentive for recycling. \n“With so little environmental impact, reuse is definitely the best bet,” Barczak said. “It keeps bottles and cans out of tips and incinerators, saving energy and valuable resources.” \nAfter Germany introduced a deposit return scheme in 2003, the rate of single-use bottle returns rose to 98.5%, the highest in the world. In Sweden too, around 90% of the 1bn cans sold annually are handed in for recycling. \nIn the UK, the figure reached 57% in 2015, but according to leaked government documents obtained by Greenpeace the target fell to 49% in 2016, and is due to increase by 2% a year. Taxing coffee cups is not the answer: here's why Read more The waste problem \nDavid Palmer-Jones, CEO of the waste and recycling company Suez, said that businesses were increasingly filling the void left by “an absence of government direction at a UK national level”. \nNorway, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands have all rolled out highly effective deposit return schemes, while states in the US and Australia report positive results, with expansions planned. \nBut Coca-Cola’s announced support for trials of a bottle deposit return service in Scotland has shone a spotlight back on the private sector. \nCosta Coffee also recently launched a takeaway coffee cup recycling scheme , encouraging drinkers to hand in their cups for polymer-stripping, paper pulping and recycling. \nAt present only one in 400 takeaway coffee cups in the UK are recycled. \nProposals currently winding their way through the EU’s law-making process would force all EU countries to increase their recycling of packaging waste to 75% by 2030 . \nPlastic makes up about 80% of all litter in the world’s oceans, with more than 8m tonnes of the substance dumped in waterways each year. \nWithout drastic action, there will be more plastic than fish in the world’s oceans by 2050 by some estimates, and an estimated 99% of seabirds will have ingested plastics. \nSign up to be a Guardian Sustainable Business member and get more stories like this direct to your inbox every week.
