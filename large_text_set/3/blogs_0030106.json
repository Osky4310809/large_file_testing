Published: Wednesday, March 29, 2017, 7:06 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News \nIs the JD(U) led by Nitish Kumar getting back to the NDA. Work is on behind the scenes to mend ways in a bid to pave the return of the JD(U) into the NDA fold, sources tell OneIndia. Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar \nThe Nitish Kumar led JD(U) was part of the NDA for 17 years. He however walked out of the NDA after Narendra Modi was declared as the NDA's prime ministerial candidate in 2013. \nOne got to see the ice melt when Nitish Kumar praised the decision on demonetisation. In fact Nitish was the only leader in the opposition to repeatedly praise the decision while the rest criticised it. He had said that the opposition including the Congress should not have criticised the decision especially when the common man was supportive of the decision. \nThe reason for a change in heart is because Nitish is unhappy with the RLD's Laloo Prasad Yadav who is part of his government in Bihar. Nitish feels that if the alliance with the RLD continues, his image would take a beating. The two had come together and formed a grand alliance in Bihar. \nBJP sources confirmed that there is backroom talk with the JD(U) which has expressed interest to come back to the NDA. If the talks work out, then it would be a shot in the arm for the NDA too. The NDA which falls shot in numbers in the Rajya Sabha would have nine additional MPs. \nThere are 16 Rajya Sabha MPs from Bihar. Out of this nine are from the JD(U) while 5 are from BJP. The remaining two are from the Rashtriya Lok Dal. BJP sources also say that so far the talks seem to be on the right track. Both parties are hopeful that they would be fruitful, the leader also said. \nOneIndia News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:15:39.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
