Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJ.K. Rowling has fired back at Piers Morgan after he appeared to blame her and her supporters for both Brexit and Hillary Clinton losing the US presidential election. \nPiers, who found himself trending on Twitter today after comedian Jim Jefferies told him to \"f**k off\" during Real Time With Bill Maher, had dashed off a tweet @-ing in the Harry Potter author earlier today - and she wasn't going to take it lying down. \n\"This is why I've never read a single word of Harry Potter,\" he wrote after she shared a clip of the four-lettered rant. \n\"Because you had a premonition that one day the author would roar with laughter at seeing you called out for your bullshit on live TV?\" she snapped back. (Photo: ITV) \n\"Everything I said was factual. If you think screaming 'F**K OFF!!!' at me changes that, then you're mistaken,\" he replied. \n\"Would you like a couple of hours to mock up some pictures of refugees carrying explosives to substantiate your position?\" she quipped. \n\"The superior, dismissive arrogance of rabid Remain/Clinton supporters like @jk_rowling is, of course, precisely why both campaigns lost,\" he then posted. \nIn response, she shot back: \"The fact-free, amoral, bigotry-apologism of celebrity toady Piers Morgan is, of course, why it's so delicious to see him told to f**k off.\" JK Rowling (Photo: Copyright unknown) \nHer fans were delighted with her comeback, with one tweeting: \"He set himself on fire and hoped jk would die of smoke inhalation.\" \nAnother wrote: \"If you could compare him to an STD, which would one choose?\" \nAnd a third compared the Good Morning Britain presenter to one of Rowling's less favoured characters. posting: \"Piers is so Gilderoy Lockhart.\" \nIt's not even the first time this week that JK has had to whip out her one-liners on Twitter. (Photo: Twitter) \n\"@Jk_rowling glad I caught this article on yahoo. I will now burn your books and movies too,\" one tweeted her earlier. \nAnd she soon fired back with: \"Well, the fumes from the DVDs might be toxic and I've still got your money, so by all means borrow my lighter.\" \nAnd her sassy responses didn't stop there.

Stone was one of the first books I EVER read. I'm upset it has to be that way... You embarrassed me, disgusted me, and I will never read your work again.\" \n\"Guess it's true what they say: you can lead a girl to books about the rise and fall of an autocrat, but you still can't make her think,\" Rowling responded. \nA third Twitter user then told her to \"stay out of politics\". JK Rowling (Photo: Getty) \nHe wrote: \"You're a grown woman whose entire career is based on stories about a nerd who turns people into frogs. Stay out of politics.\" \nBut once again, she replied with a witty comeback, writing: \"In - Free - Countries - Anyone - Can - Talk - About - Politics,' she responded. \"Try sounding out the syllables aloud, or ask a fluent reader to help.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T15:56:49.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
