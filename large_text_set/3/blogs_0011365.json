you could’ve ever thought possible – ACB 54 delivered one of the most action-packed nights of MMA ever held on British soil and will live long in the memory of all those in attendance and watching around the world.\nThe main event of the evening saw two of Europe’s finest middleweight fighters in action with Poland’s king Mamed Khalidov taking on British fighter, Luke Barnatt.\nThe fight had been talked up for weeks as one of biggest fights in European MMA history, but when it went down only 21 seconds were needed.\nBoth Barnatt and Khalidov wasted little time from the outset and the stood in the pocket trading strikes.\nWith barely eighteen seconds on the clock, the critical strike landed as Khalidov connected with a huge overhand right to send Barnatt staggering back against the cage.\nIncredible by Mamed Khalidov! Wasted no time to claim victory in the main event of #ACB54 ! https://t.co/NsdDUUkp6c \n— ACB fighting league (@acb_league) March 11, 2017 \nThe Polish fighter then swarmed him, landing a few more strikes before dropping him to the mat.\nReferee Herb Dean stepped in to call the fight in what was a well-timed stoppage despite Barnatt contesting the decision when he was back on his feet.\nThe crowd, who were heavily populated by Polish fans, cheered to the rafters as the rightful king of Polish MMA celebrated in the cage after.\nLoughnane smashes through Wilkinson In the co-main event of the evening, two British featherweights rekindled an old rivalry as Brendan Loughnane and Mike Wilkinson went toe-to-toe.\nThe fight went only two minutes and thirty seconds and the whole time only one man looked like he’d win it.\nLoughnane dominated from the outset and used leg kicks to get into range to unload strikes.\nMidway through the first round, Loughnane landed a huge knee and Wilkinson hit the deck.\n#ACB54 – Brendan Loughnane KO’s Mike Wilkinson in 1R. The knee at the end ! pic.twitter.com/EAC2TzRU36 \n— Jolassanda (@Jolassanda) March 11, 2017 \nWilkinson tried to get to his feet, but Loughnane swarmed him with strikes and the referee called the fight off at exactly two minutes and thirty seconds.\nIt was a stunning performance by Loughnane.\nYousaf lights up Manchester IMMAF world championship gold medalist Shoaib Yousaf took his professional record to 2-0 with a clinical win over Javonne Morrison.\nYousaf dealt with Morrison’s early onslaught well and when his opportunity came he finished the fight with a stunning head kick and strikes combination.\nACB 54 – Shoaib Yousaf 1R TKO (head kick + punches) (vs. Javonne Morrison ) Morrison is not happy with this stoppage pic.twitter.com/KfPT0dRrIX \n— Jolassanda (@Jolassanda) March 11, 2017 \nThe youngster’s traveling fans, ‘The Yousaf Army’, went crazy in the stands as he simply walked around the cage as if he’d barely been for a Sunday night.\nWhiteford steamrolls Phan and calls for UFC return Robert Whiteford is targeting a return to the UFC (Picture: Getty) Another man making a big statement was last evening was the Scotsman, Robert Whiteford.\nThe former UFC man was released by the company in the middle of 2016, but with last evening’s performance, he could well find himself back in the UFC Octagon soon.\nWhiteford wasted little time dealing with a tricky opponent and fellow former UFC man, Nam Phan.\nThe Scotsman blitzed Phan early, caught him with an uppercut and then pushed him up against the cage.\nRob Whiteford chokes out Nam Phan in 21 seconds – #ACB54 . Welp. pic.twitter.com/YJyV0HVq7r \n— caposa (@Grabaka_Hitman) March 11, 2017 \nFrom there Whiteford applied a standing guillotine choke and Phan was rendered unconscious with just 21 seconds on the clock.\nIt was a stunning win and Whiteford took the time to tell Metro.co.uk afterward that he felt he’d done more than enough to get a recall back to the UFC for the upcoming UFC Glasgow show on July 16.\nMassive upset as Rogers defeated Home favourite Saul Rogers was stunned by his late replacement opponent (Picture: Getty) Former The Ultimate Fighter contestant Saul Rogers was also in action last evening as he faced last minute replacement, Aurel Pirtea.\nThe odds were heavily stacked in the favor of the British fighter with the Romanian getting the call up on just 48-hours notice and Rogers looked in control after a dominant round one.\nIn round two though everything got turned on it’s head.\nWhat an upset! Aurel Pirtea defeats local favourite Saul Rogers! #ACB54 https://t.co/qguXtqn1Jv \n— ACB fighting league (@acb_league) March 11, 2017 \nRogers dove in for a takedown, but Pirtea read it and quickly put him in a deep guillotine choke.\nThe British fighter simply had nowhere to go and after 30 seconds of struggling, he was left limp and unconscious.\nIt was arguably the biggest upset of the night and Rogers left the cage looking dejected and understandably disappointed to have suffered the second loss of his career.\nBest of the rest On a breathless night of 23 fights, there were also big wins for British fighters Dean Garnett, Azi Thomas and Kane Mousah.\nSpinning back kick KO by Dean Garnett. Liver shot. #ACB54 pic.twitter.com/UQEAzAOwPm \n— caposa (@Grabaka_Hitman) March 11, 2017 \nGarnett’s finish especially was one to be remembered as he dominated his previously undefeated opponent Michael Tobin in every exchange on the feet before finishing him in the second round with a crazy spinning back kick.\nACB 54 Full Results \nMamed Khalidov def.
