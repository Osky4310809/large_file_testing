Long Story \nThere was devastation across the seven kingdoms (continents) when Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss said that the show will only be around for two more shortened seasons . Sadly, just two 7/8-episode seasons would remain for Jon Snow, Dany and the White Walkers, the showrunners said last July. \nBut you can wipe those tears because there might be hope for more. \nHBO Programming President Casey Bloys told Entertainment Weekly that the network hasn't made a final decision about how much GoT will remain. \n“They’re still figuring out the shape of the season, what they want to do,” Bloys said of Benioff and Weiss. “I’ll take as many as they want to do. If they give me eight, I’ll want 10. But it’s really up to them. They’ll let me know.” \nvia GIPHY \nSpeaking like a true businessman. \nBloys also discussed the possibility of a sequel or prequel, something the showrunners haven't been too hot about . \n“It’s such a big property we would be foolish not to explore it, but it’s a pretty high bar,” he said. “We’ll take some shots at it. I’m not going to do it just to do it. It has to feel very special. I would rather have no sequel and leave it as-is then have something we rushed out.” \nMore GoT would obviously be great, but there's nothing worse than a show going on longer than it should. Plus, with no George R.R. Martin book to draw from (he said Winds of Winter might be out in 2017 , but we'll believe it when we see it), that's putting a lot of faith in HBO to maintain the show's excellent plot . \nYou'll be able to see Season 7, however long it is, this summer. Own The Conversation Ask The Big Question \nShould HBO make a prequel or sequel even if none of the current showrunners, nor Martin, are involved? Drop This Fact \nGame of Thrones usually premieres in the spring, but it will debut later this year due to weather conditions in Spain and Iceland where the show is being filmed.
