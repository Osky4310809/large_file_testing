Some fans have been excitedly waiting for signs of Ann Mitchell’s return as Cora as it was hinted at the time when she left that it wasn’t the last we would see from Cora.\nWith Denise recently quitting her job at Minute Mart – in scenes that saw the return of Yolande Trueman – she will soon find herself signing on at the Job Centre. Denise looks hopeless in the pictures snapped from filming – but the photos confirmed that she would come face to face with Cora.\n(Picture: ISO Images) It remains to be seen whether Cora has got her life together since we last saw her and EastEnders are not commenting on her return at this stage, meaning that we can’t be sure whether this is a one off episode or a longer term comeback for the long suffering character.\nEither way, there are bound to be some excited Cora fans out there!\nMORE: EastEnders boss Sean O’Connor disccuses community storylines and Ronnie and Roxy Mitchell’s deaths \nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Will Lauren Branning cheat – and can Josh actually be trusted?
