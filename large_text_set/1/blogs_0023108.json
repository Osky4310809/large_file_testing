The impressive Sone Aluko shone for Fulham against his former club \nEvandro did pull one back with a stooping header from Andrew Robertson's left-wing cross early in the second half but the goal only sparked Fulham into life once more. \nGood work by Sessegnon saw them restore their lead soon after as he unselfishly passed the ball when clean through for Martin to score his fourth goal in five games for the club. \nMartin, booed by sections of the crowd having refused to play for Fulham earlier in the month, then returned the favour to allow Sessegnon to double the lead. \nJohansen's deflected effort beat Eldin Jakupovic in the 78th minute to underline their dominance and make up for an early close-range miss. \nFulham themselves have missed seven of their last nine penalties but it was Hull in wasteful mood in the final moments with Hernandez the culprit. Evandro provided the only bright spot for Hull in their 4-1 defeat at Fulham \nHaving already gone close three times before the break, the Uruguayan first failed to beat Bettinelli after Kalas fouled Robertson before squandering another chance after being fouled by the goalkeeper himself in the resulting melee. \nThe unfortunate Hull, who included Liverpool loanee Lazar Markovic in the starting line-up for the first time, were not helped by the loss of Curtis Davies early on. \nAt least Marco Silva's men can now concentrate on securing Premier League survival. For Fulham, the FA Cup dream is alive and well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T16:48:31.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
