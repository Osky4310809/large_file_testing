But with new changes come new problems. From Kickstarter backer reviews no longer counting towards a game's average score, to the continued confusion of just what Early Access means, Steam has a lot of room left for improvement. With over 4000 games released on Steam last year alone, and 2017 shaping up to be even more hectic, we picked the brains of a handful of developers for ideas on how Steam can improve in the year ahead. Review the review system \nBig changes hit Steam's review system in 2016. Prime among them was the separation of reviews tied to Steam purchases, and those tied to Steam keys bought from external sources or provided by developers for free, with only the former counting towards a game's average score. This has been especially hard on games funded through Kickstarter, since Steam now effectively ignores the opinions of a significant portion of their player base. For Megan Fox of Glass Bottom Games, the studio behind Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore a Fedora , this change has been a tough pill to swallow, but she remains hopeful things will improve in 2017. \"It's very much a double-edged sword,\" she says. \"Given how exploited keys were getting, I don't know if [Valve] had an immediately better option. Hopefully, they're working on a fix or workaround.\" Tyler Glaiel, the programmer behind Closure and Bombernauts, appreciates that the filtering of reviews makes it tougher for dodgy developers to abuse the system by buying positive reviews. Better yet, it makes selling games outside Steam more viable. \"[It] makes it slightly safer to put your game in a Humble Bundle without worrying too much about the influx of negative reviews from people who didn't really care about your game in the first place.\" \nOnline mobs can really hurt a gameâ€™s standing, so ways to mitigate that seems like they would be worth pursuing. Forrest Downling, Designer \nAt the same time, smaller games often suffer from a lack of reviews, with their average scores skewed by a handful of effusive fans or a few jaded players. James Buckle, the indie developer behind the recent Captain Kaon , feels Steam could do more to encourage people to write reviews and even out such anomalies. \"In the same way they do for Steam sales, they could have Steam review trading cards,\" he suggests. \"They have all the mechanisms in place to do that, and that would encourage people to go and write Steam reviews for games they like.\" By rewarding high-quality user reviews and continuing to weed out the jokey and disingenuous ones, Steam reviews might actually become a viable means of judging a game's quality, instead of a home for all-caps memes and armchair game design. \n2016 also saw Steam introduce the 'Last 30 Days' review score.
