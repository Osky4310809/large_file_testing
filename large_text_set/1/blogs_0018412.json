The event officially referred to as “Voices of Hope and Resistance,” was the third gathering of its kind since 2009. \nOrganizer Andy Shallal explained to NPR earlier this week that it is intended as a “gathering of artists and activists and progressives to sort of take a moment and pause and assess all the successes we’ve had for the past few years – successes around the environment, around marriage equality, around women’s rights… Sometimes in very difficult times, we forget to stop and celebrate and take that pause.” \nIn addition to Solange and Spalding, the party featured a number of activists, politicians and journalists, including scholar/activist Angela Davis, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, author Alice Walker, actors Ashley Judd and Danny Glover and journalists/commentators Van Jones and Melissa Harris-Perry, according to New York magazine. \nSolange did a short set of songs from A Seat at the Table , including “Don’t Touch My Hair,”“Cranes in the Sky” and “Weary.” \nCheck out some footage of the event: TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T15:50:37.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
