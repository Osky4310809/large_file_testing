Rajamouli’s blockbuster Baahubali: The Beginning, could prove to be the litmus test for the film industry lobby that is batting for dubbing of other language films into Kannada. \nWhile social media is abuzz with arguments for and against dubbing, the Kannada Film Chamber of Commerce (KAFCC), a parallel forum of the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC), that is opposed to dubbing, is now trying to ensure that the film is dubbed and released in Kannada. \nKrishne Gowda, president, KAFCC, said he had approached K.V. Vijayendra Prasad, the script writer and Mr. Rajamouli’s father, to release the film in Kannada. “Mr. Prasad has promised to consider the proposal,” he said. Members of the Kannada Grahakara Okkoota have appealed to people on social media to support their demand of having the dubbed version of the sequel. Sources say the film is likely to hit theatres in April. It is because of the long legal battle fought by KGO that hurdles in dubbing other language films in to Kannada have been cleared recently. Meanwhile, the Karnataka Dubbing Film Chamber of Commerce, is heading the pro-dubbing movement. \nMr. Gowda said that Naanu Nanna Preethi, a dubbed version of a Hindi film , has been released in 37 screens. \nSatyadev IPS, a dubbed version of the Tamil film Yennai Arindhaal , is ready and will be released shortly. A dubbed version of Arrambam, another Tamil film, is also ready under the title Ranadheera . Mr. Gowda said over 40 films from other languages are in the process of getting dubbed and released in Karnataka.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:35:57.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
