Though OPS is leading the revolt against Sasikala, most AIADMK MLAs still seem to be supporting the newly anointed and powerful general secretary. If the standoff continues for long, the constitutional crisis could possibly even pave the way for President’s rule in the state.\nAIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala and Chief Minister O Panneerselvam at MGR’s Ramavaram residence in Chennai. Photo.C Suresh Kumar\nThough OPS has got backing from AIADMK’s point person in Delhi and Rajya Sabha member, V Maitreyan, yet he only has eight MLAs by his side so far. Even if the Governor were to give him time to prove his majority on the floor of the House, he would still need to win another 110 MLAs to reach the magical figure of 118 in the 234 member assembly. Most MLAs are playing safe and are in a wait-and-watch mode. This was evident when Sasikala claimed that over 100 MLAs were present at her Poes Garden residence on Wednesday afternoon.\nAfter 40 minutes of silence at Jaya memorial, O Panneerselvam shatters Sasikala's peace https://t.co/BYpbxL5aWw pic.twitter.com/4cXqwdDMWq\n— Times of India (@timesofindia) February 8, 2017\nThe role of the Centre could be the differentiator between OPS and Sasikala in this power struggle. Election Commission has already asked AIADMK to explain if Sasikala’s ascension to the post of general secretary violated party bye-laws. The Governor too seems to be missing in action at this crucial juncture which has delayed Sasikala’s plans to take over as chief minister. This lends credence to reports that OPS has the backing of the Narendra Modi led NDA government.\nDA case: Supreme Court verdict may hit Sasikala's plans – The Times of India https://t.co/6wlVg1DEO4 via @timesofindia Oath postponed\n— Ram Datt Sharma (@RDATT26) February 7, 2017\nAll eyes will be on the Supreme Court which could pronounce a judgement in the disproportionate assets case next week. The case relates to Sasikala and her two relatives in connection with disproportionate assets worth Rs 66.65 crore. As per the law, if the jail sentence in a conviction is more than two years, then that person is disqualified from holding an elected office for a period of six years. An adverse decision will send the entire flock of AIADMK MLAs running towards OPS.\nSasikala sees DMK hand behind outburst, swearing-in uncertain https://t.co/y1fZgEWI4W via @TOIChennai pic.twitter.com/RcwDlMX6T0\n— Times of India (@timesofindia) February 8, 2017\nOn the other hand, if Sasikala comes out clean and is invited to form the government, then OPS – who may not have the numbers to form the government himself – but would only need only 15 more MLAs to vote against Sasikala to bring down the government. Sasikala need 118 MLAs on her side to survive in a house of 234 MLAs where AIADMK has 134 MLAs while DMK, Congress and IUML have 89, 8 and 1 member respectively. With both sides claiming support of majority of MLAs, the possibility of a short stint of President’s rule if the crisis goes out of script for long cannot be ruled out at this moment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/timesofindia", "https://t.co/6wlVg1DEO4", "https://t.co/4cXqwdDMWq", "https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/829175520742998016", "https://t.co/y1fZgEWI4W", "https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/829130174868418560", "https://twitter.com/TOIChennai", "https://t.co/RcwDlMX6T0", "https://twitter.com/RDATT26/status/828829181370834944", "https://t.co/BYpbxL5aWw"], "published": "2017-02-08T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:16:42.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
