He deserves it. \n“In the first part of the season Yaya wasn’t in the squad because of physical reasons - and we all know the second part why he didn’t play. \n“But, of course, he now deserves to be in the Champions League squad in the next round.” \nToure’s future at City looked bleak when Guardiola omitted him from his European squad at the end of August because he wasn’t deemed fit enough.
