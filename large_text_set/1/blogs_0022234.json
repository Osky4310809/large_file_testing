Why, for example, were Ms. Brjansdottir’s black Doc Martens found on the docks of a harbor about 25 miles from the beach where her body was found? Why was there snow on their soles on a snowless day? How did traces of her blood get splattered on the seat of a red Kia Rio sedan? And was she sexually assaulted before her death? \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The national mystery began on Jan. 14 when Ms. Brjansdottir’s mother phoned the police in a panic after her daughter failed to return home from a bar crawl in downtown Reykjavik on a foggy night. Surveillance video, released by the police, showed Ms. Brjansdottir walking unsteadily by herself down a deserted street at around 5 a.m. At one point, the police said, she could be seen near a red Kia. It was the last time she was seen alive. Continue reading the main story ReykjavIk Metropolitan Police released footage of Ms. Brjansdottir from the night of her disappearance. As the disappearance dominated news bulletins across the country, about 775 rescue workers volunteered to search for the missing woman, who had distinctive red hair. Icelandic newspapers and television reported that in her last post on Facebook on Jan. 12, she lamented that it was “two minutes until the worst day of the year,” because “Kiss a Ginger Day” — a day of empowerment for redheads — was nearly over and no one had kissed her. A few days later, after frantically scouring the Icelandic capital and its surrounding areas for clues, the police found her Doc Martens on a dock at Hafnarfjordur, a sleepy town on the outskirts of Reykjavik known for its annual Viking festival , its local rock ’n’ roll bands and its picturesque lava fields. After reviewing video from the scene, they noticed something else: A fishing trawler from Greenland, the Polar Nanoq, moored to a nearby dock. Not far from it they spotted a small red car. It was parked there at 6:30 a.m., the surveillance video showed, and it was the same model as the vehicle seen next to Ms. Brjansdottir before she vanished. Tracing the license plate, the police learned that the car had been rented by two men from the trawler.

Credit Reykjavik Metropolitan Police There was just one problem. The men who were now the prime suspects in Ms. Brjansdottir’s death could be on the ship, but the Polar Nanoq had set off for Greenland days earlier. Fearful that the suspects would get beyond their reach, the Icelandic Coast Guard sent a helicopter with a squad of six special forces officers, known as the Viking Swat Team, to intercept the vessel , a spokesman for the Icelandic Coast Guard, Sveinn Gudmarsson, said. About 90 minutes later, Mr. Gudmarsson said, the squad — part of the only armed police force in Iceland — rappelled onto the trawler and arrested the two fishermen, who did not resist. He said that the ship was aware “the Vikings” were pursuing them and had already altered course to return to Reykjavik. “The weather was bad and there were eight-meter-high waves,” he said. “The crew cooperated.” Helgi Gunnlaugsson, a sociology professor at the University of Iceland, said the case had captivated and shocked Icelanders not only because killings were so unusual in Iceland — in 2012 it had the third-lowest murder rate in the world after Liechtenstein and Singapore — but because the suspects were foreigners and the case had seemed such a mystery at first.
