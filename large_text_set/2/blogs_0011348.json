The timing means that the U.K. will likely be fully withdrawn from the EU by summer 2019. \nThe royal visit is likely a way of extending an olive branch to France and signaling that the U.K. wishes to maintain a strong alliance, despite the fact that they are leaving the union. However, according to Express , the trip is not meant to be “overtly political.” \n\"We have a very strong relationship with France and the French people and this visit will celebrate those close ties,” a senior royal aide told the newspaper . \nThe visit also comes just before the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death in Paris. However the royal couple is expected to avoid the Pont d’Alma tunnel where Princess Diana died in a car crash in August 1997.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:57:29.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
