Photo from Valdez’s Instagram account. Alyssa Valdez has had one of the most successful volleyball careers in the Philippines winning three straight UAAP MVPs, two UAAP titles and several more awards in other leagues. And after leaving Ateneo, Valdez is starting her international career in the Thailand League where her first opponent would be Pleumjit Thinkaow and the powerhouse Bangkok Glass. READ: Valdez to make Thai League debut against Bangkok Glass ADVERTISEMENT Bangkok Glass has been to the Philippines for two international competitions, the AVC Asian Women’s Club Championship and the FIVB Women’s Club World Championship, but Valdez was not able to compete against them. This time, however, Valdez will be making her debut against the Thai club and the prospect of facing Thinkaow is something the former Ateneo Lady Eagle is looking forward to. “Playing against and with the veterans and superstars here in Thailand is something that inspires me to be a better volleyball player and reminds me that there are a lot of things to improve on,” Valdez told INQUIRER.net Wednesday. Against Bangkok Glass, Valdez teams up with 3BB Nakornnont captain Tichaya Boonlert, the PSL-F2 Manila’s import during the world championships. Boonlert was PSL-F2 Manila’s Thai reinforcement that shared the playmaking responsibilities with Kim Fajardo. “I hope this experience will help me mature and grow not only as a player but as an individual as well,” said Valdez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:23:17.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
