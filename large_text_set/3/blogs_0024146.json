Their article, ‘Becoming Duterte: The Making of a Philippine Strongman,’ sounds like a well-paid hack job for well-heeled clients with shady motives,” Abella said. \nIn the NYT article datelined Davao City, Duterte was described as a privileged child-turned-populist politician and an anti-drug crusader who has struggled with drug abuse. \nDuterte was also portrayed as “obsessed with death” who turned “his violent vision into national policy.”   \nAbella said Duterte should be cited instead for not bowing to Western influence or pressure in leading the country to the path of progress and development. \nHe lamented that his critics would rather focus on the more than 7,000 deaths in his war against drugs than on his initiatives like talking peace with Muslim and communist rebels and fighting graft and corruption. \n“He is a rough hewn outsider who vowed to reduce poverty; restore trust in the government by addressing crime, corruption and illegal drugs; and reinforce peace agreements with ethnic Moros who experienced historic injustice, and the CPP/ NPA/ NDF who have been fighting for social justice for decades,” Abella pointed out. \nHe said the NYT article “cynically and unfairly narrates the President’s rise to power in the context of violence.” \n“It deliberately fails to mention the many initiatives the President made when he was Davao City mayor,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T09:23:56.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
