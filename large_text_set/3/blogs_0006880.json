In case you haven’t experienced “Illuminations,” the story of the show is told in three parts: the Earth’s fiery birth, which includes flames and fireworks. Second is the “Triumph of Life” scene, in which a globe reveals the history of human achievements over time. Lastly, the “Hope for the Future” scene sends light into the sky as the globe blossoms like a lotus flower.\nLearn more about “Illuminations” here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:02:39.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
