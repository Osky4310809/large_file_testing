Trust serves as the foundation to a life you build together. \nThat is unless your wife won’t let you keep some kittens, in which case, eff her. You can totally lie about what you’re doing behind her back, which is, of course, raising said kittens. \nJimmy is an 85-year-old man living in Puerto Rico with his wife. It isn’t unusual for his neighborhood to serve as a home for stray cats. Twitter \nWhile his wife doesn’t want the cat near the house, Jimmy is a bit more tenderhearted. His granddaughter Syl told The Dodo , \nMy grandpa felt for the stray cats and would leave food in the back of the house near his tool shed, a spot where my grandma doesn’t go. This particular cat was especially friendly and got attached to my grandpa. \nThis extremely friendly cat was pregnant, which made her grandfather fall for her charms even harder. my grandpa let a stray cat have her kittens in his tool shed and now he's raising a bunch of cats behind my grandmas back bc she said no \nJimmy’s wife didn’t want her husband to tend to the pregnant mother cat and her babies that were on the way. So, he went behind her back and housed them in his shed. \nThis is the only kind of betrayal I can condone. \nThe kittens were born and Jimmy knew he made the right choice. However, his wife didn’t know the cats were there. Twitter \nSyl said, \nMy grandpa is really kind and has always loved animals. So it’s not really that surprising. \nBut it’s difficult to keep a second family a secret, even if that family is cats. Jimmy’s wife finally found out about the other woman and her children three weeks after the kittens were born. Twitter \nThankfully, once she saw the cats, she was more understanding. Syl added, \nShe’s OK with them staying there until they’re old enough to have new homes. Twitter \nJimmy is taking care of the mama cat and her kittens, but plenty of other strays could use your help.
