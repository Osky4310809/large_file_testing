Rick managed to calm Daryl down enough for Rosita to explain that Dwight had said he wanted to help them. But it seemed Rick wasn’t interested in joining forces with one of Negan’s people.\n“That true? You want to help?,” Rick asked before pulling out his gun. “Ok, get on your knees.”\nBack at the Sanctuary, Sasha was locked in a cell of her own after infiltrating the compound in “The Other Side.” However, Negan—who showed up just in time to rescue her from a rogue Savior intent on raping her—was quick to offer her the same deal he had made with Eugene (i.e., join the cause in order to reap the rewards).\nHowever, Sasha couldn’t reconcile with the idea of becoming a Savior and instead begged Eugene to help her commit suicide. He complied with this request by bringing her the poison he had refused to give to Negan’s two wives earlier in the season.\n“The First Day of the Rest of Your Life,” the final episode of Walking Dead ‘s seventh season, will air April 2 at 9 p.m. on AMC.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:08:10.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
