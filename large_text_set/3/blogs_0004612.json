The recently-concluded MWC was no different. While only time will tell if all the tech trends we saw would translate into reality, but they do make us feel excited nonetheless. So let’s take a look at the top tech trends from MWC 2017. Smartphone displays get more immersive \nOver the years, displays on our smartphones have remained largely the same, apart from of course, the changes in their sizes or the bump in the resolution. At this year’s MWC however, we saw the next revolution in phone displays. The Korean giant LG is betting big on the unconventional aspect ratio of 18:9 available on its latest G6 flagship ( first impressions ), which it’s dubbing as a FullVision display. This resolution offers more room for content in comparison to the usual 16:9 ratio. Since it’s effectively the same as a 2:1 ratio, you can open two apps simultaneously in perfect squares. The brand is also offering the ability to play HDR videos on the G6, as it’s compatible with both HDR10 and DolbyVision standards. In fact, the LG G6 is the world’s first smartphone with support for DolbyVision. \nSony on the other hand, is leading the resolution game with its latest flagship, the Xperia XZ Premium ( first impressions ). The device offers 4k resolution along with support for HDR videos. \nWhile we aren’t sure if the unconventional resolution opted by LG would kick off a new era of phone displays, we’re quite sure that HDR video-toting displays are the next big thing. Of course, compatible content needs to be there for both of these things to flourish, but with streaming services like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix already offering the same, it’s only a matter of time when more and more videos are available with this capability to offer better colours and contrast levels. The 5G era begins \nWhile India might be in the middle of a 4G revolution, it seems that telecom operators are gearing up for 5G, which is supposedly 10 times faster than LTE connections. The latest upstart in the industry, Reliance Jio, made the biggest waves by making a global announcement of its partnership with Samsung for 5G networks . Back in India, Airtel and BSNL also made similar announcements and joined hands with Nokia Networks. Not just Indian companies, all the global giants, be it telcos or equipment manufacturers or even device makers, are envisioning a future powered by 5G. In fact, ZTE’s Gigabit phone became the world’s first smartphone to offer Gigabit-class speeds with support for 5G. Sony’s latest flagship, the Xperia XZ Premium also boasts similar capabilities thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC ticking inside. \n5G goes beyond impressive upload and download speeds. It will also be the backbone of many other upcoming revolutions such as Internet of Things, self-driving cars and Virtual Reality and much more. While it’s not available right now, companies promise that 5G would come as soon as 2019. Camera capabilities getting upgraded \nWhile we might not have witnessed a revolutionary change in the camera aspect of smartphones, we did see some really interesting features when it comes to imaging in recent smartphones. First one, of course, is the dual-camera setup becoming a norm rather than an exception. Huawei’s P10 ( first impressions ) offers two cameras consisting of 20MP + 12MP sensors, with the similar capabilities as the P9 ( review ) – the primary camera captures RGB images while the secondary one shoots in grayscale. The Huawei P10 also gets a portrait mode ala the Apple iPhone 7 Plus ( review ), letting you focus on the subject and blurring the background. LG’s latest, the G6 also boasts of twin cameras, but unlike the G5, they both are of the same resolution – 13MP. This time around, you can not only get the wider frame, but you can also control the wide angle to get the required scene in one shot. Even brands like Gionee and ZTE are joining the dual-camera bandwagon with the A1   and Blade V8 Mini respectively. \nSony’s Xperia XZ Premium gets a mention here as well, as the device comes with super slow motion recording that allows you to capture 20-second videos in 960fps. This feature is also available on the Xperia XZs ( first impressions ). The devices boast predictive capture functionality that ensures that you never miss out on action shots. The ISP in the smartphones can detect motion in advance and is able to capture even before you click the shutter button. \nThen there’s OPPO which might not have released a device, but did give us a peek at the impressive camera tech it’s working on. With the intelligent use of two camera sensors, the company promises an optically-stabilised zoom of up to 5x. For reference, Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus offers 2x optical zoom. While the tech is surely amazing, it’s tough to get really excited about it, considering OPPO is yet to bring the two technologies it showcased at last year’s MWC into its phones. Focus on experience instead of specs \nThe fastest processor in town, the amount of RAM, the number of megapixels and what-not – there’s no end to the specs race, and it seems manufacturers are now ready to rise above all that. Instead of competing on the specs front, they’re now trying to focus on providing a seamless real-life experience. The LG G6 is the prime example. As a flagship, it features last year’s SoC, the Snapdragon 821, which is surprising considering that the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 is just around the corner. However, we believe that LG is taken a strategic decision to opt for the SD821. While the SD835 seems to be in low supply till the time Samsung Galaxy S8 (related read: what to expect from the Samsung Galaxy S8 ) ships, the LG G6 will have an advantage of being available in market sooner. Even in terms of RAM, LG has continued with 4GB of capacity. While it might not stroke the spec nerd’s dreams, the device should be able to handle everything thrown at it with ease. \nNokia also seems to be going the same route with its comeback under HMD Global. Its trio of Android offerings – the Nokia 3 ( first impressions ), Nokia 5 ( first impressions ), and Nokia 6 ( first impressions ) – give weightage to the user experience with the pure and latest iteration of Android. In fact, this philosophy seems to be inspired from Moto, and we aren’t complaining. Of course, we need to test out the capabilities of these smartphones, but if Nokia can deliver a smooth performance, we couldn’t care less if it’s not running the best SoC or packing in 4 gigs of RAM. The brand is also promising regular Android updates, which could be a big draw to potential consumers. \nWe’re surely hoping that these trends would make for tech that change our lives for the better.
