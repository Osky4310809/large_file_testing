Moments later, Busch and Logano tangled, with crew members pulling Busch away as blood ran down his forehead.\n“There wasn’t much talking, just a lot of swinging,” Logano said. “I was racing hard there at end.”\nBusch was pulled up off the ground by crew members and taken to the infield care center to get his forehead looked at. He was quickly treated and released.\n“I got dumped. He flat out just drove straight in the corner and wrecked me,” Busch said. “That’s how Joey races, so he’s going to get it.”\nThe fight overshadowed a tough-luck finish for Keselowski, who appeared to be pulling away on a restart and on his way to his second win in as many weeks when he ran into mechanical problems.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T01:50:13.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
