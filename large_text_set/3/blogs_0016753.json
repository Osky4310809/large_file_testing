Actual facts.\nIn the world of business advice, we believe that the only ideas worth sharing are ideas based on evidence. Our mission is to improve the practice of business by identifying the most important new ideas in management, vetting them for rigor, shaping them into practical wisdom for executives, and delivering them in ways that are convenient and, we hope, enjoyable to consume.\nFor two days, we aim to demonstrate the worth of our mission as broadly as possible.\nWe believe MIT SMR can play a central role in helping you navigate the challenges of your world. I invite you to dig in and test our claims. We will let the evidence speak for itself.\nWhy not begin here ?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:32:00.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
