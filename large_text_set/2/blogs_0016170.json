What to drink \nWin the “best drinks” category by mixing up some Oscars-themed cocktails for you and your friends. \nInspired by La La Land , The Clase Azul “Sebastian” is one of the official cocktails of Elton John’s Academy Awards Viewing and Post Party in West Hollywood. Here’s how you can make it at home: \nIngredients: \n1 oz pomegranate lime juice \n1/2 oz organic raw honey \nTop with sparkling water \nOrange garnish \nDirections: \nIn a large shaker filled with ice, pour in Clase Azul Plata, then add fresh grapefruit and pomegranate lime juice together. Top with organic raw honey on the finish. Shake and strain into a glass. Top with sparkling water, add a fresh orange garnish, and serve it on the rocks or straight up. \nThe Clase Azul 'Sebastian' cocktail (Photo: Photo courtesy of Jose Martinez) What to eat \nWhat better to go with some Oscars-themed drinks than some Oscars-themed snacks? \nAlthough you can’t go wrong with a movie-watching classic like popcorn while watching your favorite film stars, if you’re looking for appetizers that pack a bigger punch, the St. Cloud Times has a list of recipes inspired by this year's nominees, like Moana- themed coconut pork and pineapple skewers. Here's how to make them: \nIngredients: \n2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into cubes \n1 large fresh pineapple, cut into chunks \n1 14-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk \n⅓ cup sweetened condensed milk \n2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce \n2 tablespoons soy sauce \n2 tablespoons fresh lime juice \n1 teaspoon salt \n1 teaspoon ground black pepper \n6-inch wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes \nDirections: \nIn a saucepan, combine the coconut milk, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, lime juice, salt and pepper over medium heat. Whisk until sugar is completely dissolved, about five minutes. Pour the marinade into a large bowl and allow to cool completely. \nOnce cool, whisk the sweetened condensed milk into the marinade. Mix in the pork chunks, tossing to coat completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour, or up to four hours. \nHeat a grill pan over high heat. Thread marinated pork chunks and pineapple onto skewers, repeating until all ingredients and skewers have been used. Grill skewers over high heat, turning occasionally until pork is well browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Serve warm. \nLooking for something a bit sweeter? Try a Zootopia inspired ice-cream and more . \nEat like 'Moana' this Oscars Sunday. (Photo: Disney, AP) What to wear \nWant to look just as good as your favorite films make you feel? Try dressing up as your favorite character! \nIf you're looking for something simple yet snazzy, add a little la-la-love to your look by going for a vintage, La La Land inspired outfit. \nBright dresses like the ones Emma Stone wears as Mia in the movie can be found in the double-digit price range on clothing sites such as Modcloth and Topshop .
