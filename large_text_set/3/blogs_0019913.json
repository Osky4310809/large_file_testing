Mrs Walker said afterwards: \"He was very easy to speak to. We talked about how it used to be; how awful it was. \n\"It was something nobody liked to talk about. I think he's great. Princess Diana wanted to know all about it when she visited too. \"It shows he's got a good heart, like his mum.\" \nA fter lunch, Prince Harry unveiled a plaque commemorating his visit to LASS and the centre's 30th birthday, before being entertained by a short burst of African drumming as he left the site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:43:49.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
