His current deal is set to expire in June 2018.. \nBarca have recently given new contracts to Neymar, Sergio Busquets and Javier Mascherano, but the club haven’t been able to reach an agreement with Messi. \nAfter the win over PSG, Neymar said: “Leo will renew. That is for sure.” \nBut the Champions League victory hasn’t changed coach Luis Enrique’s mind about leaving the Catalan giant at the end of the season. \nHe said: “Nothing has changed [regarding my future]. It would be a bit daft to change something based on what happens in 90 minutes… or 95.” Deportivo La Coruna's midfielder Alex Bergantinos (L) vies with Barcelona's Argentinian forward Lionel Messi.

Arsene Wenger was also one of the main reasons why I joined Arsenal. \n“However, I also know that in football everything moves very quickly and a lot differently to what you had planned. Therefore, it would be wrong to say that my future is dependent on the coach. \n“Everything is still open. There have been talks with Arsenal but at the moment, I’m concentrating on the current season, just like the officials at Arsenal.” \nOzil is currently the club’s highest-paid player on £140,000 a week, while Sanchez takes home £10,000 less.

Source: AFP \nWright believes Wenger will be presented with a new two-year deal as owner Stan Kroenke is more concerned with Arsenal’s revenues than the amount of trophies they’ve won. \nWright told BT Sport: “We found out there’s a two-year contract on the table a month or two months ago. \n“He always sees his contracts out and signs a new one and I can’t see what will be different this time. \n“Why would Kroenke sack a person who can double his money? \n“It doesn’t seem like they’re worried about if Wenger wins the Champions League as long as he qualifies… if he wins the league as long as he’s in the top four.” Anti-Wenger 'Wexit' protest 0:23 \nA RSENAL STRIKER BLOWS \nNew striker Lucas Perez is ready to quit the club after struggling to break into the first-team, according to Goal. \nThe 29-year-old has impressed in the limited performances he’s made, but reportedly wants to move clubs to press his claim for a spot in Spain’s 2018 World Cup squad. \nThis comes as former Gunners target Alexandre Lacazette is attracting interest from Atletico Madrid, according to Marca. \nThe 25-year-old has long been tipped for a move away from Lyon, but the Spanish club could face competition from Liverpool and Juventus, who have also been linked with the forward. Lyon's Goal of the Year entry 0:32 \nHowever, the Reds may be more concerned with securing the signature of Fulham 16-year-old sensation Ryan Sessegnon with the club confident of signing him for £10m, according to The Sun. \nMeanwhile, Jack Wilshere says he has no idea if he will be at Arsenal or Bournemouth (where he’s on loan) next season, according to The Mail. \nThe 25-year-old midfielder said: “I’m not thinking about it.” \n“I’ve got a year left at Arsenal. As soon as the season ends, I’l sit down and I’ll think about it. \n“But my main concern at the moment is trying to keep Bournemouth in this league. \n“No matter what happens next year – if I’m here, if I’m not, if I’m at Arsenal, whatever – you know no-one wants a relegation next to their name. \n“You don’t want to be involved in a team that got relegated so that’s what we’ re doing now, trying to put Bournemouth in a good position. \n“At the end of the season I’ll have a think about it.” West Bromwich Albion's Jake Livermore, left, and AFC Bournemouth's Jack Wilshere battle for the ball.

It’s easy,” NYCFC manager Patrick Vieira said. New York City FC players Andrea Pirlo (L) and David Villa.

It’s just a question of time and to see what is going to happen. Leave the time to the time.” \n“I don’t know if it will be my last season. Now I think about playing and playing well for the club. When it will be the time, I’ll decide the future,” Pirlo said. \n“I don’t know. I think to play now. After I don’t know what will be my future. It’s important to play well. After this season, I decide if I continue to play or come back to Italy to retire.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
