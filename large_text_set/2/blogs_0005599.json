Researchers found a long list of items including smashed jars and a leather strap for binding and cloth for wrapping the scrolls, but they did not actually find an actual scroll.\n“The important discovery of another scroll cave attests to the fact that a lot of work remains to be done,” said Israel Hasson , director-gneral of the Israel Antiquities Authority, in a press release. “We are in a race against time.”\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls are a collection of ancient manuscripts thought to be among the oldest known surviving Judeo-Chrisitian texts.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:03:22.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
