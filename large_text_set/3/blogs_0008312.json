I have been running since 2008. Advertisement \nQuote of the Day, motivation, and inspiration — every morning rundown \nAdvice on training, nutrition, shoes, and more — every evening Keep this field blank \nPrivacy Policy | About Us \nWhat prompted you to start? In 2004, I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. Post-diagnosis, I struggled with my emotions even though I was grateful to have clear answers as to why I was so sick. After my fifth child was born, in 2007, I wanted to find something to help alleviate the symptoms and the side effects of the immune-suppressing drugs I was prescribed to treat Crohn’s. At the time, I was 40 pounds overweight and I felt awful. Thankfully, I met a personal trainer at a local gym who suggested I try running as a simple way to ease into better fitness. The rest is history. \nHow often do you run? I run six days a week and lift weights two days a week. \nWhat is your routine? On Monday, I do a pace run that is usually three to eight miles. My pace and distance varies depending on my time goals for my next race as well as what week I’m on in my training schedule. Tuesdays, I do an easy three to four mile recovery run with weights. On Wednesdays, I complete another pace run that ranges from around three to twelve miles. Then, on Thursday, an additional easy three to four mile recovery run. On Friday, I essentially repeat Tuesday and do an easy three to four miles with weights. My long runs are for Saturdays—I usually go about 10 to 20 miles depending on what distance I’m training for. Sundays are my rest day. \nDo you race? If so, how often, and what kind of races? Starting in April, I run a half marathon each month through December. I might also schedule a marathon this year, which will take the place of a half during one of those months. I typically average nine half marathons a year with other, smaller distances such as 10Ks and 5Ks , sprinkled throughout, that I run with my family in the summer months. \nDo you engage in other sports or activities? If so, what and how often? In addition to running I lift weights twice a week and also enjoy competing in triathlons over the summer. As a family of seven, with kids ages 9-18, we enjoy hiking, backpacking, and climbing mountains every summer. We have summited five peaks over 11,500 feet in several Western states such as Utah, Colorado, and Nevada. We also climbed Mount Whitney, which stands at 14,505 feet in Northern California. \nWhat’s the most rewarding part of running for you? I love how our bodies are designed to respond to exercise. If I am willing to be consistent and work hard, I’ve learned my body can accomplish amazing things. I enjoy hard work and running as fast as I can, for as far as I can, in the most efficient way possible. Because I haven’t always enjoyed good health, I really appreciate being able to run and exercise. Each day I am able to run and be active fills me with gratitude because I personally understand how so many others aren’t as blessed. \nPlease describe your weight loss journey, including your before and after weights. After I delivered my fifth child, I worried I might not be around to raise my children. I felt sick all of the time and longed to be able to have a strong body. At the time, I weighed 195 pounds. My trainer, Paul Hafen, quite literally helped me save my life. We took measurements and set up a regular exercise plan and discussed good nutrition that would work for me despite my health challenges and dietary restrictions. \nSoon we decided the time was right and I could sign up for my first 5K. So we set a time goal and a personal goal to run the entire race without walking. I finished my first race and was amazed at what I had accomplished. The following year he helped me move up to 10Ks, and then three years later I completed my first half. Eventually, Paul encouraged me to run my first marathon and was there supporting me when I placed third in my first race. Looking back, it still amazes me how far I’ve come. Now, I weigh 150 pounds. \nWhat is the secret to your weight loss success? My secret to success is consistency, hard work, dedication, and self-discipline. I took my health into my own hands and decided to do all that I could on my own instead of waiting for a doctor to tell me I needed to make healthier habits. While I can’t stop the progression of Crohn’s disease, I can choose what I do with the rest of my body and what I put into my mouth. Whole, raw, and healthy foods are the key to helping the body heal and work hard. It’s not enough to be dedicated and consistent with exercise if I’m going to fuel my body with poor nutrition. I have learned that when I feed my body appropriately for life, it will respond appropriately. The feeling of running and not being weary is better than any sofa, fast food, or sugar that I ever put in my mouth. \nRelated: 41 Superfoods: How They Can Help Your Running \nHow do you stay motivated? I’m pretty lucky that I have experienced poor health because it’s not hard to stay motivated when you remember how terrible it is to be sick. I also look into the faces of my husband and five children and remember I have a lot to live for. Beyond that, I am always trying to work hard and improve. I like to know what I can do better and I enjoy working on fixing it. I also love traveling to different places and running while I’m there. After nine years, it has just become a way of life. \nDo you have any favorite motivational quotes? “Be the change you want to see in the world.”—Ghandi \n“Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.”—Abraham Lincoln \n“Adversity introduces a man to himself.”—Albert Einstein \nWhat are your current short and long term goals? My short term goal is to place in a half marathon. My long term goal—like many runners— is to Bqualify for the Boston Marathon , or BQ. I also aspire to complete a half and full Ironman . \nRelated: I Was Terrified of Swimming—So I Signed up for an Ironman \nIs there anything else you’d like to tell us? Living with Crohn’s disease is really difficult. Some days I feel 100 percent, while other days I struggle with vomiting and diarrhea. I can do everything exactly the same (sleep, diet, and exercise), but when I wake up and to run a race, I still have to stop and use the bathroom. It can be very discouraging, but I’ve learned to be happy with even the smallest victories and keep moving forward. Before the last marathon I completed, I struggled with nausea and diarrhea five days before the race. I had trained to BQ, but I just didn’t feel well enough leading up to the race. I had never struggled so much with my gut before a race. \nThe morning of the marathon, I opted to back off my BQ pace so I could finish the race even though I knew it meant I wouldn’t qualify. After fighting severe nausea the entire race, at mile 21 I finally puked. I reached the point where I couldn’t take in any more fuel because I would just continue to vomit and dry heave, which makes it nearly impossible for me to run. I didn’t want a DNF, so simply finishing the race became the new goal. When I crossed the finish line, I was grateful I had made the right choice to back off my pace even though it meant going back on months of hard work. Many people run because it’s their lifestyle or to be skinny, but I literally run to save my life so I can raise my kids. It’s been quite a journey. \n* * * \nWe want to hear how running changed you!
