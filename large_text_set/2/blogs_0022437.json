Watch Victoria tell her story in the video above! \n\"I zoned in on the cellulite on the back of my arms. Yes, cellulite on your arms is a thing! I've had it since the beginning of my journey and while it's lightened up since then, it's still not totally gone... because I'm human,” the 28-year-old personal trainer wrote on the post, which has now been liked more than 36,000 times. \"So, do I love the look of my arms on the right?
