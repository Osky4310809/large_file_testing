He has a good mentality and works hard every day. \n“He has the qualities to be a very, very important player for Southampton and be a top player [for England]. He takes good corners and free-kicks. He sees things before others. He can play one-or-two touches and he can be dangerous in a good team. \n“We have a nice academy [to create players like Ward-Prowse] and a good training ground. Southampton have all the advantages to create good players, when you compare it to Serbia, Southampton has the better facilities. They can produce a player who is much more ready.” \nSouthampton have produced the likes of Gareth Bale, Theo Walcott and Luke Shaw from their academy, which has a decade of success in producing young talent. \nHowever, Manolo Gabbiadini has been stealing the headlines for Southampton with an impressive run of six goals in four games since his £14 million January arrival from Napoli, and Tadic says that he has enjoyed playing with his club’s newest signing. \n“He is a very nice guy. As a football player, he is a very good striker who knows how to score goals. He smells where the goal is. He knows how to play good football and so far to play with him is very, very nice,\" he added. \n\"We have a good connection and with time, it will get better and better. He finished very good chances. He has a very good left foot and knows how to score goals. Everything he shoots is a goal and for us that’s very good. \nTadic's Southampton side have had huge ups and downs this season and he believes his side are back to their best thanks to their EFL Cup run, in which they were unlucky to lose in the final to Manchester United. \n“We have had our ups and downs this season, this is normal because our team is young,” he continued. “I think in the last three games we have found our system and are playing in our best positions. \n“I think in the last four games we have played very well. We scored eight goals in two Premier League games and against Manchester United we played in the final and we deserved much more. \nNeymar drops huge Man Utd hint \n“We are happy with how things are going and expect, with time, that things will get better and better. I am happy, you have ups and downs, it depends how the team plays. If your team plays well, then I play well. \n“If not then it is harder for me. I think we are back to our best. I am in my best position in the middle of the 4-2-3-1. It is easier for me to play there and you can see with our statistics and goals that we are much more dangerous. It has been a joy to play in recently.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T10:31:10.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
