She previously worked as an associate at McKinsey & Company, and as an associate at Avenue Capital Group.\nExpedia expanded the size of its board to accommodate Clinton, boosting the size to 14 members.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:59:04.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
