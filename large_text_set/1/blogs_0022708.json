The Penguins never have won five in a row. \nMercy (3-11, 1-9) still leads the all-time series, 30-21, though IND now holds a 20-19 edge since 1979. \nThe game marked the first edition in four years that the teams hadn't played earlier in the season (in matchups that weren't counted in the official series record), and the unfamiliarity at times showed. Both offenses struggled early. \nIND, in fact, held Mercy without a field goal for the game's first 13:13. Miraculously, however, the Magic never trailed in the first half by more than five, staying in the game at the foul line. \nMercy's first basket, a 15-foot bank shot by freshman Charia Roberts (11 points), gave the Magic an 11-10 lead with 2:47 left in the half. Roberts, one of four freshman on a team with no seniors, scored seven points in the second quarter, leading her team on a 10-0 run as it took a 15-10 lead into halftime. \nIND was 1-for-14 from the field in the second quarter, often settling for low-percentage 3-point attempts. \nThe Magic, who at times played with three freshmen on the floor, extended their lead eight on Ada Clare Tempert's layup early in the third. \n\"We knew they were going to come out pressing us, so the last couple of practices we've just been working on our press,\" Mercy coach Steve Anderson said. \"We reviewed film, we went over the mistakes that we made last year and we made a conscious decision that we weren't going to make those same mistakes. The girls did a great job in the first half. In the second half, IND came out and was a little more aggressive, and we panicked.\" \nThe Penguins forced 14 turnovers after halftime, using an 11-2 run, capped by Williams' long jumper, to take a 22-21 lead late in the third quarter. \nArmstrong then helped give IND control early in the fourth, first completing a three-point play on a driving layup, then nailing a 3-pointer and finally scoring on a fast-break layup — all in quick succession. \n\"It was just the girls getting the nervousness out of their system and being ready to compete and play basketball,\" said IND coach Robert DuBose, whose team started 4-for-29 from the field. \"They talked to each other at halftime and said, 'Hey, let's go.'\" \nSaid Armstrong: \"My teammates knew that we had to come back out here and dominate from the start [of the second half]. We were all on the same page.\" \nThis night, however, was about far more than just basketball. \nAlumnae of both schools show up nearly two hours before tip-off to renew acquaintances and reminisce in what has become a basketball-themed reunion. For players at each of the all-girl Catholic schools, the night serves as an unofficial homecoming. \nFormer Mercy coach Pauline Smith launched the event — originally played against Seton — as a fundraiser for her program before Baltimore Bullets games at the Civic Center. IND took Seton's place in 1967, and \"The Game\" has since drawn huge crowds to venues including Loyola's Reitz Arena, UMBC's RAC Arena and — before its move to SECU Arena in 2014 — the Towson Center. \nGirls Basketball \n(at SECU Arena) \nIND 39, Mercy 26 \nIND - Armstrong 19, Williams 7, Gately 8, Ammons 1, DuBose 2, Isokpunwu 2. 12 12-23 39. \nMercy - Roberts 11, Curry 6, Edwards 4, Tempert 3, Krahl 2.
