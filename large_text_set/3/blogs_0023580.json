She has since become a well-known speaker and writer on human rights.\nIn her 2015 memoir , In Order to Live: A North Korean Girl’s Journey to Freedom, Park describes how she escaped with her family through a harrowing journey across the Gobi Desert. After surviving rape, hunger, and the imprisonment and death of her father, she made her way to South Korea and, eventually, to America, where she now studies economics at Columbia University.\n& Posted by Yeonmi Park on  Wednesday, March 8, 2017 In many of her speeches, she references the movie Titanic , which she watched illegally while living in North Korea. She said the love story, along with other movies, became her vision of a world outside North Korea, where people are forbidden to read or watch anything that does not support their government and “Dear Leader.”\n“Those movies did give me a taste of freedom and they showed me that there can be different life, there can be different ways of living, but that didn’t really give me a sense of what was really wrong about my country,” said Park, in a recent Facebook live video . She works with an organization called Flashdrives for Freedom , which sends USB drives across the border to reach the North Korean people. The flash drives are loaded with Hollywood movies and television shows, but also documentaries on subjects like democracy and communism as well as homemade videos of markets and everyday scenes from South Korea.\n\nShe believes the flash drives will help North Koreans understand more about how to attain the freedom they see in the movies.\n“I think why I advocate getting information is very important to free North Korea eventually is because people really ask me why North Korea, why people inside the country, don’t do anything about it, and I say that if you don’t know what you deserve, if you don’t know what you can have, how do you demand your rights?” said Park. \n& Posted by Yeonmi Park on  Wednesday, March 15, 2017 She encourages everyone to get involved with Flashdrives for Freedom and asks that the people of North Korea not be forgotten.\n“I never thought this day was going come,” she said. “I am free like this and go all around the world…but the people in North Korea, they have no idea what is possible. They don’t really know what is really possible in their lifetime, and that’s why I think it is really important we get information inside North Korea and tell them they can be like us. They can be free like us and can have this kind of lifestyle.” \nBut she also knows how dangerous it is for her to speak out, even now that she is living in America.\n“[Since the video went viral], a lot of people told me how much they really care about my story and how much they care about my people, but the greatest fear for me is being forgotten,” she said. “I hope that Kim Jong-un is not going to kill me and I will be free next year and the following year so I can keeping telling the story and keep going places to advocate freedom in my country. Even if something happens, I don’t think I will have any regrets because you have heard me. You have showed me how much you care.” \nTo learn more about Yeonmi and her efforts, you can follow her on Facebook .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:16:59.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
