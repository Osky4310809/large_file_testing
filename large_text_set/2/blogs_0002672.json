Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker each added 18 points for the Spurs. \nJamal Murray scored 20 points off the bench and Nikola Jokic had 11 in 15 minutes for Denver, which was playing the second game of a back-to-back and fourth in five nights. The arduous schedule seemed to catch up with the Nuggets in the second half. San Antonio opened the third quarter on a 21-7 run. \nGinobili and Parker have been part of 639 of Popovich's wins, and the veterans turned back the clock in the record-setting win. The 39-year-old Ginobili set a season high for points despite sitting out the entire second half, going 4 for 5 on 3-pointers. The only player older than Ginobili to score 18-plus points for the Spurs was Tim Duncan, the final member of the team's vaunted Big Three, who had 21 points against Denver on April 8, 2016. \nParker finished 8 for 8 from the field after scoring just one point in the team's previous game. The 16-year veteran had four straight points midway through the first quarter, including a layup ahead of Jokic after a steal against Jameer Nelson.   \nGinobili topped that with 10 points in four minutes and 16 of the team's 18 points in his initial seven minutes. \nTIP-INS \nNuggets: F Danilo Gallinari missed his second straight game with a strained left groin.
