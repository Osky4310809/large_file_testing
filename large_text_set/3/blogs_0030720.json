Photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym Good belly-slimming laugh – Laughter is not only the best medicine, it is the most effortless way to burn calories. Chuckling through a 15-minute stand-up comedy routine can burn between 10 and 40 calories. And this feel-good activity releases a feel-good hormone called serotonin that could reduce appetite. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym Lose the belly dance – Whether you love the disco or can only tolerate an occasional slow dance at weddings, dancing has major weight loss potential. Jamming out with friends at a party can burn between 450 and 600 calories depending on how vigorously you get down. Even swaying at a concert for an hour can counter the effects of that small 230-calorie order of McDonald's French fries you might be tempted to eat on the way home. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym Hot and less heavy – Sex is one of the best workouts outside the gym. For those who can make it last 30 minutes, intercourse can burn about 160 calories. The same amount of foreplay expends about 55 calories. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym Shop till you drop the pounds – When rifling through racks of clothes or bins of school supplies, know that an hour of shopping can burn about 180 calories. And if you go grocery shopping for that amount of time, all the heavy lifting can help you burn closer to 260 calories. Just make sure to avoid \"shopping and eating at the same time,\" Lofton said. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym Work it off – For overweight women and men, standing instead of sitting at the desk burns about two more calories a minute and can lead to a weight loss of 16 to 20 pounds a year, according to Mira Rasmussen, an exercise physiologist at the Obesity Action Coalition, an obesity advocacy group. You can also try pacing the office; a total of two hours a week can lead to a weight reduction of about 10 pounds a year, Rasmussen estimated. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym At the top of your lungs – Don't be shy about wailing along to your favorite tunes, at least in the privacy of your own home or car. Singing can burn about 136 calories. Bonus if you can also dance to your favorite tunes. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym Cut the fat – Cooking may seem like a hassle, but 30 minutes in the kitchen can burn about 100 calories. Sure, it would be much easier to pick up dinner on the way home, but \"you don't get the benefits of chopping and moving around,\" Lofton said. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym Shiver me thinner – You may hate the subzero temperatures in your office but that uncontrollable shivering is probably keeping you from gaining weight. A recent small study found that people burned 438 more calories in a room that was 60 degrees than in an 81-degree room. At that rate, you could burn about 18 calories in an hour just by being a tad chilly. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym Lean sweep – The house won't clean itself, so you might as well buckle down and burn some calories. For an average sized man, it takes about 110 calories to do a half hour's worth of sweeping or vacuuming. For an average-sized woman, it takes about 95 calories. Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym Mental burn – When you really put your mind to it, you can burn an additional 1.5 calories a minute. The brain, an energy suck compared to the rest of the body's organs, already uses up 20% of the calories you go through in a day. But demanding more of those already active neurons -- say by focusing on a crossword puzzle or Rubik's Cube -- can ramp up the amount of energy the brain burns through. Hide Caption Two and a half hours a week of moderate intensity exercise is recommended The ideal form of exercise is something that you'll actually do (CNN) Between work commitments, family responsibilities, and the stress of everyday life, we have legitimate reasons to fall short of our fitness goals. That's why, for many, the pre-goal should be maximizing the efficiency of your workout regimen. Interval training exercise could be a fountain of youth Two and half hours a week of moderate intensity exercise is what is recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association. Ideally, this means 30 minutes, five times per week, of activities such as jogging, ballroom dancing, biking or swimming. Moderate intensity means you're working in the intermediate zone. If you're able to hold a conversation with the person next to you while doing that activity, you're in the zone. If you don't have time for five workouts per week, recent evidence in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that cramming 150 minutes into the weekend, the so-called \"weekend warrior\" model, transfers similar health benefits to spreading out fitness across the week. The only risk here is overuse injury, such as a case of Achilles tendinitis from running 10 miles on a Saturday after not doing any exercise all week. If you're time crunched, intensity matters Maybe that workout can wait till the weekend? Newer evidence about high intensity workouts known as HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training), shows that intensity minutes reduce required exercise time by almost half . This means if you'd like 30 minutes of exercise but you only have 15 to spare, you're in luck. As I've outlined in my book \" The Workout Prescription ,\" ramping up intensity minutes reduces time requirements, and is safe for anyone. Read More Unlike moderate intensity, high intensity exercise means you're huffing and puffing and conversation is difficult. Although they're tough, HIIT workouts don't have to be fancy. They can be set up anywhere, a living room, a garage, or a basement. All that's needed is an open space, a light set of dumbbells, and a strong dose of motivation. HIIT programs are generally safe for all ages but we generally recommend touching base with your physician if you're over 40 and haven't been previously active before starting this type of program. Why it matters so much How to keep your New Year's fitness resolution from failing There are obvious benefits to exercise. People feel better, they look better, and they perform better in all aspects of their lives when they exercise regularly. Seen through the prism of the medical community, the medicine of exercise has strong scientific benefits that go far beyond the desire to fit into that new suit or pair of yoga pants. Across the spectrum of the human body, irrefutable evidence shows that exercise isn't just about getting a good workout, it's about staying healthy in a broader sense. Exercise can treat depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances. For your heart, it lowers blood pressure, cholesterol levels, the risk of heart attack and stroke. Exercise reduces the risk of inflammatory bowel disease and both prevents and treats type 2 diabetes, the most expensive health problem in the United States with annual costs over $100 billion. Regular exercise has even been shown to reduce the frequency of 13 types of cancer including breast, colon, ovarian and endometrial in a large, recent study of 1.44 million subjects. Bad heart? Time to hit the gym The major health benefits of exercise kick in at 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity, or at 75 minutes per week of high intensity work. Exercise is the most efficacious drug known to humankind, works for everyone who takes it, has no side effects, and is free. That's why there's a push to include exercise, as determined through a fitness tracker, as a fifth vital sign along with height, weight, pulse and blood pressure. Movement promotes health and wellness, so why not start tracking it? The best exercise for you The ideal form of exercise for you is ... something that you'll actually do! As I discussed in my previous column , smiling and fun promote exercise compliance. If you're smiling, keep doing exactly what you're doing. Join the conversation \nSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter . In terms of body maintenance, most exercise recommendations involve a combination of endurance training such as walking or swimming, flexibility training such as yoga, and strength training. Although there's no exact science here, finding the correct formula usually means picking some of each of these activities. This might mean jogging twice per week, trying a HIIT workout once or twice per week, and taking a yoga class. There's no exact answer, the key is to find what works for you, smile and work hard. Do as much exercise as you can, there's no upper limit. When possible, try and keep your total above the recommended weekly \"dose\" and you'll be more likely to stay out of the doctor's office and on your field of choice. Dr. Jordan D.
