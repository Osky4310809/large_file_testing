Toni Erdmann tells the story of an elderly man with a penchant for pranks and wearing disguises, who attempts to reconnect with his daughter, an aspiring, no-nonsense corporate consultant. \nA writer and director for the English-language adaptation of Toni Erdmann have yet to be announced, though Adam McKay and Will Ferrell are attached as producers. \nPer Variety , Nicholson was reportedly a fan of Ade's film and approached Paramount about securing the rights for a remake. The role marks the actor's first since he appeared in James L. Brooks' 2010 film How Do You Know , and only his sixth movie since his Oscar-nominated performance in 2002's About Schmidt . His other films since then are Anger Management , Something's Gotta Give , The Departed and The Bucket List , plus a cameo as himself in Joaquin Phoenix's I'm Still Here . \nMeanwhile, Wiig remains busy with a variety of projects slated for 2017, including Downsizing – a sci-fi comedy co-starring Matt Damon – and Despicable Me 3 . Last year, she starred in the Ghostbusters reboot, Zoolander 2 , Masterminds and Sausage Party .
