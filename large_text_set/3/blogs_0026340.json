The campaign encourages pet owners to upload photos and videos to their favorite social-media platform with the hashtag #DorisBirthdayWish, and tag the Doris Day Animal Foundation (@ddaf_org).\nIn honor of her birthday, the star and the foundation will choose the top 93 entries, which will be presented to the star as a special digital birthday card, and which will be featured on the DDAF website and on PEOPLE.com .\n“We’ll show her the photos on her iPad, which she’ll review,” says her manager Bob Bashara. “She loves seeing what the foundation is doing and hearing all the success stories of pets they have helped.”\nFrom Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous \n \nMeanwhile, her devoted fans will gather in her adopted hometown of Carmel to celebrate her movies and her music at the Cypress Inn , which will host a two-day celebration to benefit the foundation, including a Q&A with Peter Baldwin (who played a small role in the 1958 movie Teacher’s Pet , alongside Day and Clark Gable) and a live auction of memorabilia, such as a Romance on the High Seas poster from Day’s film, signed by the star.\nThe hotel bar has also created a new cocktail in her honor called, appropriately, “Romance on the High Seas.”\nCourtesy Cypress Inn  \n“We wanted to make a sparkling champagne cocktail in her honor,” says Cypress Inn general manager Peter Radler. “We started with chilled French sparkling wine, and added a dash of whiskey, sugar and bitters, along with a sweet lemon twist for a little punch.”\nAll the proceeds will go to Day’s animal foundation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:58:53.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
