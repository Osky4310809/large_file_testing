The Ravens will sign the veteran running back when free agency officially begins Thursday, NFL Network reported Wednesday. Source: The #Ravens are signing former #Chargers RB Danny Woodhead. He’s fully healthy after ACL surgery in 2016. Big pickup. \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 9, 2017 \nWoodhead’s season was cut short last year after suffering an ACL injury in Week 2. The 32-year-old spent the past four years in San Diego, where he was a threat coming out of the backfield. \nIn 2015, he had 80 catches for 755 yards and six touchdowns in the passing game. The Ravens could use a boost at running back after finishing 28th in the league in rushing yards last season. \nWoodhead, who will be joining his fourth team, first made a name for himself with the Patriots, spending two-plus years in New England.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:19:19.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
