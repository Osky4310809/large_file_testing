He has gone into hiding and we are appealing to people to avail us of information. I am in touch with the Inspector General of Police, the Chief of Army Staff, the Commandant of Civil Defence, the DSS Director General and security men and equipment have been provided for Benue State. Gov Samuel Ortom \n“We are going to apprehend him. We are on top of the situation. The security agents in Benue State have done very well. We are proactive. \n”I can assure you that this renewed spate of attacks are not from herdsmen, but from Gana who is killing people and because he is being sponsored by some people. We are going after him. \n”The police, NSCDC, Army and the DSS are working with me because we believe in the rule of law and due process. I don’t need to take laws into my hands when the conventional security apparatus of the state are there. I am in touch with the President. We are all working together to ensure we achieve this.” \nWhen asked to mention the names of the alleged sponsors of the militant leader, the governor said, “No, it is not every security matter that you say or discuss in public. Some are classified and I won’t say that for now.” Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:42:47.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
