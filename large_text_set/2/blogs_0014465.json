EJ Tackett earned the No. 1 seed, followed by Tommy Jones, Dom Barrett, Tom Smallwood and Weber. \nThe TOC is the second of three consecutive PBA majors that will air live on ESPN in February. The TOC finals will be the only finals in 2017 held in an arena setting. The ESPN telecast begins at noon local time (1 p.m. ET) on Sunday. \nTOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS LIVE SCORING \nThe nine-day TOC tournament program began last weekend with the Grand Casino Hotel & Resort Winter Open, a PBA Southwest Regional tournament, which also is a qualifying event for PBA Regional, PBA Women's Series and PBA50 Tour title winners who sought berths in the 96-player TOC field. \nOn Monday night, the PBA inducted former PBA Commissioner Mark Gerberich and three players -- Bryan Goebel of Shawnee, Kan.; Steve Hoskins of Tarpon Springs, Fla., and Mike Scroggins of Amarillo, Texas -- into the PBA Hall of Fame during ceremonies at the Grand Casino. \nThe PBA revised its TOC schedule because of a logistical problem that delayed the arrival of one of the PBA's semi-trailers transporting bowling ball inventory and equipment from last week's Barbasol PBA Players Championship in Columbus, Ohio. \nThe official practice session was moved to Tuesday and the TOC officially begins today, a day later than planned. The TOC will be completed as planned, with only a minor adjustment in the format in order to complete the event in time for the televised finals. \nOriginally consisting of 40 qualifying games, the schedule was revised by reducing the third qualifying round from eight games to seven on Friday to accommodate an earlier start time. The Round of 24 will take place Friday evening. The final eight games of qualifying to determine the five stepladder finalists will begin Saturday morning. \nAmong those who competed were former TOC winners Jason Belmonte, Weber, Sean Rash, Kelly Kulick, Patrick Allen, Tommy Jones, Chris Barnes, Goebel, Norm Duke and defending champion Jesper Svensson. Kulick is the only woman ever with a PBA Tour title. \nPBA Hall of Famers in the field included Weber, Duke, Goebel, Scroggins, Parker Bohn III and 57-year-old Walter Ray Williams Jr., who needs a TOC title to complete the PBA Triple Crown and Grand Slam. \nAll qualifying rounds of the TOC were covered on PBA's live streaming service, Xtra Frame (visit xtraframe.tv for subscription information). The live ESPN stepladder finals also will be live streamed on ESPN3 and the WatchESPN mobile app. \nFIRELAKE PBA TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS \nREMAINING SCHEDULE \n(all times are local/CST; Eastern Time is 1 hour ahead) \nToday (Feb. 18) 9 a.m. - Top 16, 8 qualifying games Top five after 39 games advance to ESPN stepladder finals 3 p.m. - PBA TOC Experience Pro-Am Sunday, Feb. 19, FireLake Arena Noon (1 p.m. EST) - Live ESPN stepladder finals.
