Back at STAR Labs, it's revealed that the trio is in a training session trying to get Wally's speed fast enough to stop Savitar from killing Iris. \nThe group assembles in the basement of STAR Labs, and Wally and Iris decide to break the news that they've become engaged. The majority of the group is pleased with the news, Joe takes Barry aside and asks why Barry didn't ask for his permission. Before Barry has a chance to answer, Cisco tells them a fire is in progress and his help is needed elsewhere. \nUp Next: The Flash/Supergirl Musical Crossover Photos Released \nOn the way to the fire, Wally is sideswiped by Savitar and thrown into a car. Barry looks back and notices Wally by car, but doesn't know that Savitar was there until Wally reveals that's who attacked. \nAt Team Flash HQ, an upset Barry lashes out at Wally for keeping the Savitar visions a secret for over a week. Barry gets upset enough to the point where he removes Wally from the team until they figure out what's going on. \nThe group wants to use the same equipment on Julian that they previously used on Joe to connect with Grodd's mind and a hesitant Julian finally agrees after some persuasion from Caitlin and the two share a kiss. \nThe crew hooks Julian up to the machine and Savitar begins speaking through Julian and it's revealed that either Savitar or Iris can live — not both. A visibly shaken Barry walks to Julian and unhooks the machine. \nThe group captures satellite imagery of a possible Savitar sighting and when Barry rushes out to the location, he sees a cult-like group worshiping a statue of Savitar. Barry sees the box they previously trapped the Philosopher's Stone in, he realizes neither the stone or Savitar are trapped in the box. \nBarry takes the box back to STAR Labs for Cisco to test and HR can be seen training Wally to make him ever faster. HR and Wally approach Cisco about vibing them to the future so that Wally can see the situation in which Savitar kills Iris. When Wally leaves the vibe, he speeds into where Barry and Iris are sitting and yells at Barry to tell him the truth about why he proposed to Iris. \nBarry reveals that he proposed to Iris because in the future where the latter is murdered, she isn't wearing an engagement ring. An understandably upset Iris leaves the room and informs Barry that she has to think about their future. \nWhen the rest of the group leaves the room, Caitlin reveals to Julian that she kept part of the Philosopher's Stone and Julian breaks the news to the rest of the group. When they realize that it's entirely plausible that Savitar can be back on Earth, as part of the Philosopher's Stone is located there, Barry persuades Julian to allow the team to summon Savitar through him once again. \nBarry begins baiting Savitar enough to the point that the Cisco is able to get a location of Savitar — he's somewhere in Central City. \nAt the West household, Jesse and Wally have a heart to heart in which Wally reveals he feels different because he was put into a cocoon while Jesse simply got her powers. As Jesse goes to embrace Wally, Wally see his mother sitting on the steps leading upstairs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:02:32.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
