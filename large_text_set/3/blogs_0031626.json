Cat \nThe study took both domestic and sheltered cats and gave them different choices of stimuli. The cats could choose between food, toys, scent or humans. In a surprising twist to most, the cats chose that human interaction over food. Though food came in second. \n“Increasingly cat cognition research is providing evidence of their complex socio-cognitive and problem solving abilities,” the study read, which was led by Kristyn R. Vitale Shreve. “Nonetheless, it is still common belief that cats are not especially sociable or trainable.” \nThe study defended cats, saying that the public perception is incorrect due to a ‘lack of knowledge.’ \n“This disconnect may be due, in part, to a lack of knowledge of what stimuli cats prefer, and thus may be most motivated to work for,” the study read. “The current study investigated domestic cat preferences at the individual and population level using a free operant preference assessment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:50:56.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
