He spoke the jargon and acted just like a cop.”\nSmith, 49, who also goes by the name Hakeem Sessions, was busted with two phony Diplomatic Security Service IDs — worn by counter-terrorism and counterintelligence agents abroad — and a fake NYPD lieutenant’s badge in Jamaica Sunday, law enforcement sources said.\nCops soon discovered he had been arrested in 1998 for drug trafficking and escaped from Davidson Correction Facility in Lexington, North Carolina after just three months behind bars, cops said.\nCops also found his acting business card and a gun, police said.\nSmith later told police he had scored work as an extra on several TV shows and had appeared on “Law & Order SVU.”\nHe griped that he was forced to miss a filming of “Blue Bloods” Tuesday — because he was a real-life slammer, police sources said.\nSmith was being held as a fugitive at the Vernon C. Bain correction center in the Bronx Tuesday, according to court papers.\nNorth Carolina cops now want him extradited back to them, police sources said.\nSmith is also wanted for a 1988 kidnapping in New Haven, Conn, according to the sources.\nAs a 17-year-old, he was arrested on a gun possession charge in New York, cops said.\nThe NYPD’s Strategic Response Group arrested Smith and charged him with impersonating an officer and criminal possession of forged items, weapons and stolen property. He was remanded on a $75,000 cash bond Monday.\nPublicists for “Quantico,” “Blue Bloods” and “Law & Order: SVU” didn’t respond to request for comment Tuesday.\nAdditional reporting by Daniel Prendergast and Shari Logan \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:13:29.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
