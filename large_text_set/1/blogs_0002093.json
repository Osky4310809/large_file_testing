Best and worst beaches in NSW: Coogee and Botany Bay rate poorly for pollution Read more \n“We have indicators we look for [in water tests], which is an indicator of faecal contamination, which is a really nice way of saying poo,” Boxshall told ABC News 24 on Monday. \n“It’s bird poo, it’s horse poo, it’s cow poo and it’s people poo. It is everything that washes in from the streets, and everything that comes out through the storm water system.” \nSwimmers who ingest contaminated water have a higher risk of getting gastroenteritis and other illnesses, particularly the elderly and children. \nBeaches on the Mornington Peninsula south of Frankston were still suitable for swimming. Boxshall said the water should clear up in 24-48 hours if it didn’t continue to rain. \nMore tests will be conducted this week and results posted on the EPA website. The Bureau of Meteorology forecast a maximum of 19C on Monday, with light drizzle in the morning and evening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T09:41:59.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
