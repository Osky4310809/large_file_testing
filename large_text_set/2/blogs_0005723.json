For example, not only is Facebook home to 1.23 billion daily active users on average, but those users come from all over the world -- with 85.2% residing outside of the U.S. and Canada. That's a crazy level of connectivity.\nAs I put together the post, it became obvious just how fast these networks were growing -- and I thought a lot about how hard is it to keep up with all of these changes, especially for marketers. To make things a little easier to wrap your head around, I put together a simplified list of some standout statistics for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instragram, and Pinterest. Check them out below if you're looking for some guidance for your social media strategy this year.\n34 Stats to Help You Plan Your Social Media Strategy on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & More Facebook Organic reach of Facebook Page post is 2% .
