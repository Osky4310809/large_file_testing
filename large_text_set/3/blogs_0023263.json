Dahnan Saminath, who appears in the infamous cell-phone video of Garner’s deadly takedown, was also forced to testify Wednesday, sources said.\nThe feds plan to continue questioning witnesses before the grand jury at least through next month, sources said.\nLast year, civil-rights prosecutors from “Main Justice” in Washington took control of the long-running investigation into Garner’s death following a clash with local feds who opposed filing charges in the case.\nNeither the DOJ nor Pantaleo’s lawyer would comment on the latest development.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:19:55.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
