Liverpool Lineups and Stats \nKlopp has urged supporters and his players to remain optimistic as Liverpool look to react from Monday night's 3-1 defeat at Leicester City . \n\"I think we showed this season what we are capable of,\" the Reds boss said . \"\"Because of your experience you all think: 'Yeah, but it's similar to this year.' \n\"Of course we have to learn from what has happened so far and use the good things and the bad things. The base of the squad is really good. \n\"At the moment it feels like when it is not only going in this direction [points upwards] but it becomes a little bit harder, a lot of people lose belief immediately. They think: 'Ah yes, we were waiting for it and now it has happened, again.' \n\"I am different. I do not have the same experiences. There is still a lot to go for. Let's try. Just because we didn't finish in the top four a lot of years, it does not have to be like that this year again. Jurgen Klopp doesn't agree with the way some people portray his character. \n\"We have to fight for it, 100 percent. A few things we have influence on, a few things we don't have influence on. We learned already and we will still learn. In this season there is really a lot to go for but to do this we need consistency. I think it makes sense that we try to bring it in immediately.\" \nAfter an initial push for the title, Liverpool now face the tough test of securing Champions League football for next season. \nKlopp attributes his team's poor form since the turn of year to injuries and a number of key players losing the excellent form they had at the start of the campaign. \n\"They have all shown how good they are,\" he added. \"It's my job to keep them like that so long as they are fit. If they are not fit, I take what I get. \n\"For example, look at Phil Coutinho, before and after his injury. Do I have a key, put it in and turn it and we are back again? No. \n\"We have the same with Joel Matip, before injury and after injury. It's not always big things. \n\"For example, Roberto Firmino. He was at the highest level and then at Leicester it was like: 'Boom!' It was really interesting to see. I had never seen him like this. \n\"Sadio Mane? Very good against Tottenham, struggled like all of them against Leicester. Things like this happen. [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang was at the Africa Cup. [Riyad] Mahrez comes back and struggles. \n\"So long as I can see the player really wants to get back to his best, I am with him. You are not allowed just to accept it and sit back and think: 'My God, let's just wait and it will come back.' That will not happen.\" \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
