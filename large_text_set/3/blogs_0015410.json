By: IANS | Mumbai | Published: March 17, 2017 1:47 PM Asked if India was turning into a saffron state, Fadnavis said: “When we talk about politics, we also talk about democracy. (Twitter) \nChief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Friday that he can transform Maharashtra in the next few years but will join the union cabinet if he is asked to. “I don’t think that a Chief Minister has more power than a union minister. Right now, I am a CM, and I have a huge agenda before me,” Fadnavis said at the India Today Conclave 2017 here. \n“In the next two-three years, I can transform Maharashtra but I am a true soldier of the party and whatever the party says, I will follow that,” he said when asked about joining the cabinet. \nAsked if India was turning into a saffron state, Fadnavis said: “When we talk about politics, we also talk about democracy. Political parties don’t wipe out other parties, it’s the citizens of the country who decide that for them. \nWatch this also: \n“ Narendra Modi has set big standards. Either other parties will have to break or match those standards,” he added. Fadnavis praised the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill and said that every state would gain from it. \n“I think that GST will be a success, but if there’s a political motive to derail it then I cannot say anything. It will roll out by July,” he said. \nHe added: “In the competitive federalism we are creating barriers, which are not benefitting anyone. GST regime will enable to have a common market. States will be benefited directly.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:30:10.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
