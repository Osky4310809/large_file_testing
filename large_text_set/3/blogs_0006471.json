ESPN's Ed Werder first reported on Feb. 27 there was \"mutual interest\" between McCown and the Cowboys. McCown, 37, spent the past two seasons with the Cleveland Browns, compiling a 1-12 record in games he played. He threw for 3,209 yards, 18 touchdowns and 10 interceptions during his Browns tenure. Injuries have been an issue for McCown in recent years; he's dealt with head, hand, ankle, rib, shoulder and clavicle ailments in 2015 and 2016. The third-round pick in the 2002 draft has largely been a journeyman backup during his NFL career. His best season came in 2013 with the Chicago Bears, when he threw for 1,829 yards, 13 touchdowns and one interception in eight appearances and five starts. It is expected the Cowboys will release or trade current backup Tony Romo, and with both Mark Sanchez and Kellen Moore also set to hit free agency, it leaves a void behind Prescott.
