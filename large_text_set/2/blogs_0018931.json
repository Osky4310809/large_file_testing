They stood an empty suit at the front of the Resurrection Life Community Church in Allentown, Pa. By Tom Shortell / The (Allentown) Morning Call \nU.S. Sen. Pat Toomey was a no-show for the town hall meeting the Tuesdays with Toomey organization set up Tuesday night, but the protest group came prepared. \nThey stood an empty suit at the front of the Resurrected Life Community Church in Allentown. \nFor two months, the grassroots organization has picketed Toomey's offices across the state, demanding he speak to his constituents and explain how he would stand up to some of President Donald Trump's actions. Toomey, who held off endorsing Trump until after polls closed on Election Day, campaigned as an independent check on whoever won the White House. \nTo date, Toomey has backed every one of Trump's Cabinet nominees and initiatives in the Senate. Angry voters have inundated his offices with phone calls and letters demanding an explanation or action. With little feedback from Toomey, protesters scheduled the town hall session during a congressional recess and invited the Upper Milford Township resident to attend. \nOrganizers insisted their main goal is to discuss the issues with Toomey and make sure he is representing them in Congress. The Pennsylvania Health Access Network, which co-hosted the event with Tuesdays with Toomey, wants to ensure people will have high-quality, affordable health care if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. Toomey, however, has ducked questions concerning people with pre-existing conditions or those covered under the expansion of Medicaid. \n\"Folks are out there looking for a dialogue about what the Affordable Care Act means to their lives,\" said Antoinette Kraus, the network's executive director. \"There's been no dialogue with the people who are really impacted by this.\" \nA call to E.R. Anderson, Toomey's communication director, was not returned Tuesday night. The senator held a telephone town hall Thursday afternoon, in which he addressed his support of Betsy DeVos, Trump's secretary of education, and the long response times his office has had due to the volume of calls. \nFor Carrie Santoro, the organizer of the Lehigh Valley chapter of Tuesdays with Toomey, the telephone call left much to be desired. Toomey gave only a 90-minute notice of the call, and the setup allowed him to cherry-pick questions during the 45-minute conversation, she said. \n\"I want to remain optimistic that he will eventually come around and hear what we're saying and engage,\" she said. \"I don't know what more motivation he needs.\" \nBut political change doesn't arrive overnight. Scot Rosenzweig, an Allentown man whose fiancee died in 2013 before the full rollout of the Affordable Care Act, reminded those in attendance that they would need to remain active if they wanted to bring about change. \n\"We need to put pressure on our elected officials to have a plan,\" he said. \"We don't want to fill pages with rhetoric. These are real issues, real people, real lives.\" \nThe crowd appeared to be up to the task even though many said this was their first time getting involved politically. While waiting to get into the church, Elizabeth Moyer said she was disgusted by Toomey's support for DeVos and would not rest until she was heard. \n\"I'm not going away. I care more about my kids than I care about my free time,\" she said. \nOther groups hoped to funnel that political anger into action. The Northampton County chapter of Indivisible, a national organization that has called on Democrats to adopt the obstruction tactics used by the tea party during the Obama administration, offered its support and sought membership at the event. Planned Parenthood will hold its own protest outside Toomey's Salisbury Township office Wednesday, demanding Toomey meet face-to-face with constituents. \nWithout Toomey in attendance Tuesday, the evening was ripe for political theater. One speaker stuck one of the pink hats adopted as a symbol for the January Women's March on Washington on the suit stand-in. Another \"accidentally\" bumped it over. One woman carried a sign that painted Toomey as Waldo of the \"Where's Waldo?\" children's books. \nAshleigh Strange of Northampton nearly turned her address into a stand-up routine. The 29-year-old said she worked two part-time jobs to make ends meet but still didn't have health care. Then she missed the deadline to register under the Affordable Care Act. \n\"They told me, don't get hit by a bus until November [when she could register]. So I became a bus driver,\" Strange said as the crowd roared in laughter. \"I figured being behind the wheel was the safest place.\" \nShe turned serious when she said the ACA allowed her to get medication for her anxiety and depression. She then turned to the suit and asked the Toomey stand-in how he planned to help those with mental health issues get the care they need to function. Every speaker for the rest of the night followed her lead and addressed their questions to the suit.
