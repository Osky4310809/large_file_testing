(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017\nVia the tweet above, President Trump has ended weeks of speculation about the feast of media self-importance that goes down each spring in Washington. It’s the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner, an event that started out modestly in 1921 and got only more obscene and absurd every year — especially in its recent celebrity-filled decades.\nThese events have a knack of being awkward. Think back to 2006, when comedian Stephen Colbert ripped the administration of George W. Bush as well as the assembled media. It was a bloodbath that provoked angst among guests and plaudits from those watching remotely.\nA dinner with Trump seated front and center promised great discomfort. Much of the president’s 2016 was premised on media-bashing, which he indulged with strident rhetoric — reporters were described routinely as “dishonest” and “disgusting” — and often very personal denunciations. News organizations were forced to hire extra security for staffers covering the campaign. Since assuming the presidency, Trump and his aides have only amped up the attacks. Adviser Stephen K. Bannon called the media the “opposition party” and suggested they keep their “mouths shut” and listen more closely to the sentiments of their fellow citizens. The president himself tweeted that “fake news” purveyors, defined as a swath of mainstream media outlets, were the “enemy” of the American people. And just Friday, the White House excluded several media organizations — including CNN and the New York Times, both of which have broken key stories on the White House — from a briefing with press secretary Sean Spicer.\nThe tweet from Trump at least brings a touch of certainty to the April 29 event. Given the lamentable state of relations between the White House and the media, major party-throwing organizations announced they wouldn’t be doing their fetes this year , and comedian Samantha Bee announced her own counter-WHCA affair.\nPatrick Gavin, a former Politico reporter who produced a documentary on the dinner, laments the end of a tradition — Ronald Reagan 1981 was the last president to skip the event, only because he’d recently suffered an assassination attempt. On the plus side, though, Gavin cites the “increasing liberation of the White House press corps: Be it this or the Spicer-briefing-[blockage] from earlier this week or threats about moving the briefing out of the White House, etc., reporters are slowly learning that they’re just better off not being dependent on anyone to do their jobs. And whining about access just doesn’t resonate with Americans back home. It just comes off as, well, whining.”\nAsked earlier this week about uncertainties surrounding the event, WHCA President Jeff Mason told the Erik Wemple Blog that the group was plowing ahead. “We will be having that dinner. It’s an opportunity to celebrate the First Amendment and celebrate the work of members and highlight scholarship winners,” he said.\nNow that celebration of the First Amendment will have to go forward without President Donald Trump. How utterly appropriate: The last thing this country needs, after all, is an event designed to air the views of our commander in chief on the media. He does that every time he gets in front of a microphone anyhow.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/2X93u3anTco?feature=oembed", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/01/30/brief-history-white-house-correspondents-dinner/Hsbm4O8ug3D3E9DBvxNNqI/story.html", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/835608648625836032", "https://twitter.com/@ErikWemple"], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:24:46.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
