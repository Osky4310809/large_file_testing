The humidity, the temperature of water, so there’s a lot of science behind it,” said Paul Ridder, president of Tastykake. \nTo find out how they do it, CBS’s Jessica Dean suited up, hairnet and all, for special access to the Tastykake bakery in South Philadelphia. \nThe bakery is in production five to six days a week, with three shifts around the clock. \nRidder acted as the guide, Peanut Butter Kandy Kakes were the goal. \nIt all starts with the cake batter. \n“We’re able to, with our oven, as the cake travels up and down through it, to exactly control the temperature and the way it bakes to get just the right amount of air in it,” say Ridder. \nBakers test the volume and weight of the batter every 15 minutes to make sure it’s just right. \nOnce the cakes cool, it’s time for the good stuff. \n“We use enough peanut butter to make about eight million peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a year,” said Ridder. \nThat peanut butter is made from a special recipe just for Tastykake. \nFrom there, the kakes head under a chocolate waterfall. \nRidder says, “We essentially bathe them in chocolate. We cover the top and actually puddle the bottom.” \nCovered in warm chocolate, the kake goes through a long cooling tunnel which dips down to 40 degrees, making them crunchy. \nThroughout the process a series of electronic eyes keeps watch over the kakes. \n“If it doesn’t identify two tastykakes in perfectly right with the seal, it’ll kick it off” \nThe good ones continue down the line and into boxes. \nNext stop: the store shelves. \n“It takes about a half hour from the time we deposit to the time they’re ready to be sold,” said Ridder. \nBetween the chocolate and the peanut butter, there’s a lot of history sandwiched in these treats. \n“Our customers are fanatical about our product and they don’t ever want it to change. So we’ve got to balance that ‘don’t do anything different’ with ‘do something new’ at the same time to keep them interested, to keep them excited,” Ridder said. \nAnd to keep them coming back for more.
