There was no response to the radio calls.” There were also no reports of any vessel being hit or anyone being hurt. \nThis tense encounter at sea is the latest involving military craft of the two countries in recent months. These incidents have included Iranian rockets being launched, drones flying over U.S. vessels and the capture of American sailors held for several days by Iran.

Fox News reports it would amount to the “biggest shipbuilding boom since the end of the Cold War to meet threats from a resurgent Russia and saber-rattling China.” \nAccording to Fox News, the U.S. Navy currently has 274 ships that can be deployed as battle force vessels. The goal of the expansion, which must be funded, of course, is a 355-ship fleet. \nThe Navy’s revised Force Structure Assessment calls for adding another 47 ships including an aircraft carrier built in Virginia, 16 large surface warships built in Maine and Mississippi, and 18 attack submarines built in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Virginia. It also calls for more amphibious assault ships, expeditionary transfer docks and support ships. \nIf there’s any significant effect of the weekend encounter between U.S. and Iranian vessels near the Strait of Hormuz — a major route of passage for the transport of Middle East oil — it may well be a boost for the additional spending required for the shipbuilding initiative. \nAccording to an estimate by naval analyst Ronald O’Rourke at the Congressional Research Service , meeting the 355-ship goal could require as much as an additional $5.5 billion in annual spending in the Navy’s 30-year projection.
