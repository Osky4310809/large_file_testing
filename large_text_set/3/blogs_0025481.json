Soon after, Simeone was approached by another European club — believed to be Paris Saint-Germain — about taking charge. \nIn the end, his affinity to the club persuaded him to remain at the Vicente Calderon, and he has no regrets. \nSpeaking about last May's defeat, he told AS: \"I got to the press room and had to go through the area where Real Madrid were celebrating and I felt a lot of pain, and I started to think that this was going to be a difficult year and it would be hard to motivate my players again.

You have to remember if I wanted to go to another team I would have had 35 million reasons. 35 million! But I didn't leave because I didn't want to.\" \nDomestically, Atletio have had a disappointing season. They are fourth in La Liga, 10 points behind leaders Real Madrid. They are, however, through to the Champions league quarter-finals, where they will face Leicester, and Simeone believes the club is on an upward trajectory.
