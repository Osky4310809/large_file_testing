Stories like, what was your body’s reaction when your throat first tasted an alcoholic beverage.. \nTell me your bad dreams, beautiful nightmares, your lucid dreams, and the things you imagine even when you are wide awake. \nTell me about the simplest things you own: a pair of your old untidy socks that your grandmother bought when you’re seven, when was the last time you wore that blue-collared polo of yours, and who bought your red Fila running shoes, and how it is valuable to you. Tell me, the parts of your body that you hated the most, and which part is the one you can call your asset. Your first kiss, and how does it feel? How does it tasted? Did you felt those butterflies like the ones I feel evey time our lips meet? How about your first hug? How long did it lasted? \nTell me the things you are afraid of. The horror stories, the dark corner of the street you hate at 12 midnight, when there’s no food in the fridge, and how are you afraid and tired to fall in love again.. Tell me.. \nTell me, and I’ll tell you, \nI would tell you how I don’t like to drink coffee at mornings, and how I love to eat pancakes simply because they’re too fluffy and to basic to eat specially when you’re not a morning person and too lazy to cook.. \nHow I love to stargaze and stare at the skies for hours and let the stars blink at me as I wink back my eyes on them.. \nI would tell you my secrets, and hidden stories that no other people know except me and the Guy up there.. \nYou would know how I love to dance at the rain yet too afraid of those big thunder and lightning.. \nI’ll tell you how I cried when my favorite actor died on my favorite movie and how happy I was when I realized he’s still rocking the real world. \nYou would see, \nHow I can be amazed by so simple things and how I could appreciate every detail of every being I love. \nTell me.. \nBecause I would love to hear all of those. I would willingly listen to all stories, fiction or non, facts, romantic happenings and as well as the tragic parts of your great life. I would gladly want to see your lips moves, smirks, and frown to every word you would spit. One at the time. Let me know you. Like I would let you know my all. \nTell me, how your past went so tragically beautiful, how your present is too complicated yet thrilling, and how you see your future. And I hope I’m still there. On the same page, and at the same book with you. \nTell me. For I would listen to you. Detailed. All of your letters, words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and even punctuations. I would save on my mind and memory, how you laugh and be frustrated by all your stories. \nTell me yours. \nI wanna see how your eyes light up when you are talking. I wanna see your lips slowly forming a smile. My favorite smile. \nLet’s see how the stories of our lives would perfectly fit for each other. \nTell me everything, the beautiful and the terrible ones, and let me love you anyway.
