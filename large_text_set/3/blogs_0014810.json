Taught by Jacqueline Gargus at Ohio State , the course features 39 video lectures that collectively offer a classic survey of Western architecture. We begin in Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome, laying the conceptual foundations for what’s to come. Then we dive headlong into Islamic, Byzantine and Medieval architecture, before spending a good deal of time with Renaissance, Baroque, and Rococo styles. Of course, we encounter many great landmarks along the way: the pyramids of Egypt, the temples of Ancient Greece, the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, Chartres in France, Brunelleschi’s Duomo of Florence, and the list goes on. \nFollow Open Culture on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Google Plus , and Flipboard and share intelligent media with your friends.
