Lustig, who came up against Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League earlier this season, didn’t hold back in his assessment of the winger. \"He always falls very light, you can barely touch him,\" he said, per Expressen (h/t Goal ) . \"Neymar is the greatest actor in football.\" Bleacher Report UK @br_uk 3/22/2017, 9:49:31 AM Neymar has been punished for simulation previously. In the Copa del Rey match against Real Sociedad earlier in the campaign he picked up a yellow card for going down too easily, while in the final of the same competition last season, he was also cautioned for taking a dive against Sevilla . He has history with Celtic. In 2013, the Scottish champions’ former manager Neil Lennon accused the Brazilian of getting Scott Brown sent off by play-acting. Neymar has had his run-ins with Celtic before. AFP/Getty Images \"Our fans are respectful of great players, but it tells you everything that (Andres) Iniesta comes off to an ovation and Neymar is booed,\" said Lennon of the incident, per Pete Jenson of the MailOnline. \"Neymar does not do himself any favours.\" Indeed, as noted by Kieran Canning of Agence France-Presse, the Celtic supporters have not forgotten what they deemed to be foul play from Neymar in 2013: Kieran Canning @KieranCanning Funny that Celtic fans booing Neymar for dive 3 years ago when McGregor & Armstrong have thrown themselves down multiple times so far 11/23/2016, 8:24:46 PM Even as he’s matured during his time at Barcelona, Neymar's build is not the stockiest and while there are undoubtedly times when he does accentuate a touch from a defender, the speed and agility with which he operates means a nudge can send him tumbling. Neymar is regularly on the end of rough treatment from defenders. CHRISTOPHE SIMON/Getty Images As these numbers from Squawka Football prove, opposition defenders regularly try to take a questionable approach in their efforts to stem his influence: Squawka Football @Squawka Most fouled players in Europe’s top 5 leagues 2016/17: Neymar (99) D. Lezcano (92) A. Belotti (86) A. Gomez (84) @Behankey_ #AskSquawka 3/15/2017, 4:16:39 PM With that in mind, Lustig’s assessment of Neymar is arguably a little harsh and perhaps there’s still some frustration simmering from the spat between the Brazilian and Celtic from 2013. \"Neymar is better than me, so to compete you try to be close and sometimes you need to do tricks and get into his head to guess what he will do,\" he admitted. Anyway, Neymar is unlikely to change, as he continues to be brash in possession. The Barcelona man will understand that occasionally he will take a kicking from defenders looking to level the playing field.
