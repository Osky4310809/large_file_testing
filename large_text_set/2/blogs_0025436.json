(credit: CBS 3) \nCAMDEN, N.J. (CBS)— The owners of the popular Ocean City restaurant chain Manco & Manco learned their fate on Friday after pleading guilty to tax evasion charges in 2015. \nThe judge sentenced 55-year-old Charles Bangle, of Somers Point, to 15 months in prison, and three years supervised release. \nHis wife, 54-year-old Mary Bangle, was sentenced to three years probation for lying to the IRS. \nMore than 100 family and friends came from several states to support the couple. \n“I’ve never met anybody with that kind of energy, somebody that puts as much into their hour-to-hour, day-to-day life as he does.Members of law enforcement even showed up to beg the judge for mercy,” said Les Cahn. \nAccording to the indictment, by only reporting $127,955 in 2010 and omitting an additional $263,113 in taxable income, Charles Bangle avoided $91,577 in taxes. He also admitted to making cash deposits into his TD Bank account in February 2011 in increments of less than $10,000 in order to prevent TD Bank from filing a Currency Transaction Report with the U.S. Department of Treasury. \n“There was also no doubt that he engaged in criminal account by failing to report all of his income on his tax returns,” said IRS Agent Jonathan Larsen. \nOwners of Manco & Manco Pizza in Ocean City Charged with Tax Evasion \nMary Bangle admitted that she was interviewed by IRS special agents on May 30, 2012, at which time she was asked questions about her personal bank account. She falsely stated that, when cash receipts came into the business, she only retained enough to pay that week’s payroll and some bills, when in fact she retained cash receipts for her personal use. \nAuthorities say Mary Bangle also lied to agents about the amount of cash deposited into her personal banking account, which was substantially more that the net pay listed on her W-2 forms issued by Manco & Manco Pizza. \nCharles Bangle will report to prison in September. The couple also need to pay nearly $250,000 in restitution to the IRS. \nThe Bangles were set to be sentenced on Oct. 8, 2015, but the date was been delayed six times. \nThere are multiple Manco & Manco Pizza establishments on the Ocean City Boardwalk and one store in Somers Point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:47:08.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
