Maxine Waters (Calif.) joined protesters at Los Angeles International Airport on Sunday opposing President Trump's executive order halting refugees from seven countries from coming to the United States. While at the airport, Waters spoke to TMZ about the president's recent executive action, which he signed on Friday.\n\"People are not gonna take this new president who thinks he's a dictator,\" Waters said. \"And doing these executive orders, and basically having a travel ban that is unconstitutional.\"\n\nWaters quickly shifted her tone, praising the protesters outside the airport.\n\"Let me tell you something: this is what democracy is all about,\" she said. \"Your government trying to take away your constitutional rights? Hit the streets, hit the streets, organize, protest, push 'em back and you'll win.\"\nPointing at the protesters, Waters continued explaining her opposition to President Trump's plans for the country and what she believes needs to be done.\n\"This is what's going to create change. We can't wait on Donald Trump to do it. This is a man who thinks he is gonna take this country in a different direction,\" Waters said. \"If he doesn't like his own country, he's making up lies about 'em, go live with Putin in the Kremlin in Russia, okay? Alright? Get outta here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T18:11:37.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
