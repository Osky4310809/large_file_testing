Tukur Buratai disclosed this when he appeared before the House Committee on Army yesterday. \nHe explained that this development had overstretched the army, which had made it mandatory to recruit 12,000 able-bodied young men. \nThe COAS noted that timely and complete implementation of 2017 budget will enhance the fulfilment of the mandate. Buratai \nHe further said that in the past eight years, the country had been grappling with various security challenges that had continued to stretch the development of Army’s assets. \n“Currently, the Nigerian Army is deployed in about 32 states fighting to eradicate terrorism, cattle rustling, kidnapping, pipeline vandalism, armed banditry and communal clashes among others,” he disclosed. \nBuratai, giving the breakdown of the 2016 budget before the House committee on Army chaired by Kwewum Shawulu, Buratai said the percentage performance of Nigeria Army budget was 100 per cent. \nHe said 62.01 per cent of the budget was for personnel emolument and 39.39 per cent for overhead capital budget. \nHe expressed concern that the limited funds released to the Nigeria Army had continued to jeopardize welfare efforts with attendant dampening of personnel morale.
