You can make your hero as muscular or as scrawny as you like. Style them with a hairdo from any decade. And even upload a picture of your face. \nHowever, I can’ t help but feel like something’s been missing. A personal touch that games have never been able to capture. But what? What can developers allow you to customize to even further bridge the gap between game and reality ? \nDong size. It’s dong size. \nLuckily, Conan Exiles is here to fill that hole. \nChris Livingston of PC Gamer got his hands on an early access demo of the upcoming open world survival game, as well as its fully fleshed out penis customization feature and hyper realistic dong physics. \nAnd Livingston spent his time doing what any self-respecting games critic would do: moving the dick slider back and forth repeatedly. NSFW but Conan Exiles has an endowment slider.
