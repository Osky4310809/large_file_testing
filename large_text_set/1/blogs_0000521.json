In addition to the acid-washed denim, the black and white pattern is intended to represent unity in today’s divisive society. The red detailing symbolizes the intensity and heart the Compton MC puts into his music. The letters “k” and “o” in the Reebok logo are also highlighted to reference Kendrick’s “KDot” nickname. \n“Now more than ever it is important for individuals to come together as one,” KDot said in a statement. “This sneaker represents that call for unity and equality, while also pushing people to look beneath the surface and uncover the hidden messages. This is something I try to do with my music, and now here with the Club C.” \nThe Club C model marks KDot’s third Reebok sneaker and follows the Ventilators , which promoted peace among rival gangs, and the Classic Leather model, “Perfect Split.” The shoe retails for $109.99 and will be available at Footaction, Sneaker Villa, Shiekh Shoes, Jimmy Jazz, Shoe Palace and Reebok.com.
