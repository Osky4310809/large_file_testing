It is the writer’s independent opinion. \nIf you’ve seen the latest Air Wick ad for their new product V.I.Poo , a little spray you can squirt before using the toilet to minimise any possible smell, you’ll agree it’s a rather memorable one. \nWhy you need to stop feeling guilty about putting your happiness first For some, it’s an ad that’ll at least give you a giggle – it’s not every day a company refers to donut-shaped poo as ‘the devil’s dumplings’ – for others, it’ll prove to be rather helpful, but for some, it’s the worst thing in the world.\nOne article I came across totally slammed Air Wick for even using the word ‘poo’, suggesting its inclusion was more of a marketing ploy.\nWorks a treat #poo #vipoo #myshitsmellsgood \nA post shared by Scott Christie (@pictures_by_scott) on Mar 18, 2017 at 5:18am PDT \nAnd all I have to say to this, is get off your high horse. Seriously.\nWhile many are having trouble attempting to comprehend the word ‘poo’ – a word which, in my opinion, is really not all that offensive and kids from the ages of three and upwards can say, this product is helping so many people – especially those with Inflammatory bowel disease.\nInflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic conditions that affect the digestive system. They can both result in a long-term need for medication or even surgery.\nI had to have major surgery to remove my large intestine after a bout of ulcerative colitis left it close to perforating. I was given a stoma bag for 10 months before having it reversed, where my small intestine was stretched to my rectum to help me be able to poo (sorry) normally again.\n(Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler/ Metro) And you know what? As someone who lives with no large bowel and therefore uses the toilet up to 8 times a day (sometimes more), products like V.I.Poo are incredibly helpful.\nSince having my reversal, I have developed anxiety around going to the toilet.\nThis is because while I could use the disabled toilets, I o ften worry about looking physically-abled and so will use the public toilets instead. \nI tend to spend a long time in the cubicle which makes me even more paranoid. I struggle to go at all, even when I desperately need to because I am so conscious of the people around me and what they’re thinking.\nBut ever since carrying around a bottle of V.I.Poo, some of my worries have been eased.\nWhy do you need a spray, why not just use a candle? Good point, but I must admit, I’d feel a bit weird lighting a candle in a public bathroom every time I went for a poo.\nWhile I’m sure negative comments about the product are nothing more than light-hearted, it goes to show how uneducated and embarrassed people when it comes to things surrounding the bowel.\nYour poo is actually really important. Different types of poo can indicate different warning signs. It’s something we all need to talking about because I’m telling you from experince, you sh*ts are important.\nThis is a PC version of the Bristol Stool Chart If you are asking What Should My Stools Look Like, here is some bedtime reading see https://www.continence.org.au/pages/bristol-stool-chart.html #bristolstoolchart #bowel #ibs #ibd #healthy #cleaneating #sorrynotsorry #insideandout \nA post shared by Hannah (@hannah_lives_her_best_life) on Feb 15, 2017 at 2:20am PST \nPeople feel too ashamed to talk about it. And it’s ridiculous.Comments that suggest these potentially helpful products are nothing more than gags are both unhelpful and stigmatizing. Many people’s lives, including my own, are very much controlled my toilet habits.\nComments that suggest these potentially helpful products are nothing more than gags are both unhelpful and stigmatizing. Many people’s lives, including my own, are very much controlled my toilet habits.\nBut we often feel as though we can’t speak up about it or seek help because we’re too damn embarrassed. We’re too scared of what others will say. And that’s just got to change.\nThere is nothing embarrassing about using products with the word ‘poo’ in the title. I’m sorry, but we’re all adults here.\nHow about, we just get over that three-letter-word and admit it’s something we all do. We all go to the toilet. We all poo.\nI'm sorry I had to do it curiosity got the better of me!!
