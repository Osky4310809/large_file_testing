It was astonishing that people actually put stamps on those diatribes. \n“There were plaintive messages from UK citizens living in Europe who now feel completely abandoned, but there were many more, branding me ‘slut’, ‘whore’, ‘harlot’, ‘scum’ and much, much worse. \n“Encouraged, no doubt, by various, more vicious parts of the media.” \nBut she told the Lords those who believed leaving the EU would be bad for the UK must “not be intimidated by the bullies” as she said she would vote against the Bill. Theresa May shocks Lords by turning up at Brexit debate \nShe called on there to be a second referendum on the final deal reached by Ms May and her EU counterparts. \nBaroness Wheatcroft’s speech came as Ms May took the unprecedented step of personally sitting in the Lords as the debate got underway. \nHer presence has been read as a visual warning to peers seeking to amend or vote against the legislation. \nThe Bill was passed unamended by a majority of 372 MPs earlier this month.
