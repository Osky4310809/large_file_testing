That's the idea behind Project Valerie, a bonkers concept design unveiled at CES 2017 from the mad scientists at Razer.\nThe base of Project Valerie is the current top-end Razer Blade Pro, for all intents and purposes. It has the same 6th-generation Intel Core i7 Skylake processor, the same high-powered NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU, the same custom vapor chamber heat management system, and the same ultra-low-profile mechanical keyboard with Chroma RGB lighting that we fell in love with. All of this is wrapped in a black aluminum unibody chassis â€” it just happens to have three 17.3-inch 4K displays attached.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T16:19:23.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
