But what is a beautiful saree with an ill-fitting or a mismatched blouse? And this saree essential is no more a mere accessory; it can actually make or break the look that you have so carefully put together! And it’s very important to pick a blouse design that suits your body type. So, here is a list of blouse designs that work wonders for every body type. Let’s take a look! \n1. Heavier up there (Apple shaped women) \nQuite a struggle for most Indian women out there! While we love our assets, we don’t really want to go overboard with an itsy bitsy blouse. On the other side, we don’t want to look like a frumpy aunty in a blouse either! So here’s what you do. The logic here is to avoid drawing attention to your bust and shift the focus to other parts of the body. One of the smartest way to do this is to wear single colour blouses. Avoid blouse designs with heavy embellishment and embroidery. If you are conscious about your flabby arms, you can always opt for a blouse with 3/4th sleeves. Pick light fabrics like georgette and chiffon that flow easily. Deep necklines are an absolute no-no, but if you really want to flaunt that style, go for a v neck or a round neck that’s not too deep. \nShop for party wear sarees . \n2. Petite beauty \nWomen blessed with this type are not heavy on the top, and can carry almost any blouse design with panache. In case, you want to add some volume to your bust, blouses with extra padding are available. If you are not comfortable with the padding, you can opt for a heavily embroidered blouse which adds mass to the top half instantly. Colours and patterns aren’t exactly a huge concern for you, but you should opt for saree fabrics like tussar silk or velvet. \nShop for silk sarees . \n3. Broad shoulders \nDon’t chain yourself to the conventional ideas of beauty. Embrace those strong, amazingly sculpted shoulders and flaunt them with the right blouse design. Avoid making wrong fashion choices like noodle straps and excessively padded blouses. The idea here is to make the body look proportionate while highlighting your assets. So, opt for blouses that have short sleeves and broad necklines. You can bare it at the back for all its worth! \nShop for Chanderi sarees . \n4. Pear shaped body \nA pear shaped woman is heavier at the bottom than on the top. To create equal proportions, you can try tricks to make your bust look heavier than it is. Go in for embellished work with three-quarter sleeves and backless blouses. Blouses of a longer length can also create the illusion of a heavier and longer torso. Avoid skimpy, corset style blouses that stick to your upper body and make it look smaller. Additional embellishments like frills, puffed sleeves and collars also give the upper body more weightage. \nShop for embroidered sarees . \n5. Hour glass \nThe hourglass is the sexiest body type for a saree . The fuller body proportions look ravishing in broad neck, full or three quarter sleeved blouses which may or may not be deep at the back. Balance out the colour palette and avoid excessive attention to one area, either the top or bottom. Thin straps and padding aren’t meant for you, so just steer clear of them. Use light fabrics that show off your beautiful curves without clinging to your body. \nShop for designer sarees . \n6. Athletic body \nA designer’s dream, the athletic body can carry any blouse design. Be it a halter neck, corset style, long sleeved, noodle strap or anything, you really don’t have a lot of problem areas to take care of, and will look drop dead gorgeous in just about anything! The best blouse designs for a slim athletic body in the modern context are corsets, crop and shirt blouses. \nShop for cotton sarees . \n7. Long neck \nTall and svelte women are blessed with a long, sculpted neck which work very well with high collared and Chinese collared blouses. These can be paired with a keyhole opening at the back or something equally interesting. Women with a long neck look great in blouses that are heavily embellished. \nShop for Bollywood sarees . \n8. Short neck \nShorter women generally have a short neck. So, the idea here is to create an illusion of a longer neck. You can opt for deeper necklines with a round or v back which seems to lengthen the neck. \n9. Flabby central \nWhile we have been meaning to hit the gym and get rid of all the mush, it somehow doesn’t happen! So, the only other thing to do is to make smart clothing choices. The blouses you design should be longer in length to cover as much surface area as possible. You can have a t-shirt style blouse of slightly heavier material like brocade which tucks in the flab. Corsets can also work well to confine the extra inches while giving your body the desired hourglass shape. Hide your flabby arms with sheer or ¾ sleeves, and you are good to go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T13:04:09.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
