Spicer says quotation marks justify Trump's unverified wiretapping claims Read more \nThe committee has asked that the justice department provide information by 20 March. \nThe California representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the committee, called Trump’s allegation “patently untrue” and urged the president to either clarify or retract his allegation. \n“I would hope if we get to March 20 and if we have the testimony that I think we all expect from the [FBI] director that there was no substance to the accusation that Barack Obama illegally wiretapped Trump Tower, that the president explain himself,” Schiff said during a press conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. “You can’t level an accusation of that type without retracting it or explaining just why it was done.” Spicer: Trump ‘wiretapping’ claims about general surveillance \nNunes said the veracity of Trump’s statement depended on whether the president’s tweets were taken literally. \n“Are you going to take the tweets literally?” Nunes said. “If you are, then clearly the president was wrong.” \nTrump made the accusation against his predecessor in a series of tweets two weekends ago, and offered no evidence to substantiate the claims. \nThe press conference comes one day after the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said Trump was “extremely confident” that the justice department would produce evidence to the House committee that supported the president’s accusation.
