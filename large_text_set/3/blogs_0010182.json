It Is Now \"Blatant Racism\" To Wear Red, White, And Blue Mar 13, 2017 7:25 PM 0 \nAuthored by Mac Slavo via SHTFplan.com, \nIn today’s hypersensitive bizarro environment, where people are quite literally having mental breakdowns following the election of President Donald Trump, everything that used to be normal appears to now elicit howls of racism, xenophobia and sexism. \nIn the latest example we turn to Iowa, where students from Valley High School attended a basketball game in traditional red, white and blue attire they reportedly wear to big games. One would think that showing support for their team wearing the colors of the U.S. flag wouldn’t even raise an eyebrow, but you’d be wrong. \nFirst, for some context, here is a picture of the offensive clothing worn by Valley High School fans at the game: \nAt first glance it certainly doesn’t look like these folks are engaging in any racist activity, but then, what do we know? \n“This is an example of BLATANT racism,” said Ty Leggett, a Valley High School alum, on the Valley High School – WDMCS Facebook page. “ ALL participating should have been pulled and banned from ALL VHS extracurricular events for the remainder of the year! As a parent, I’d be mortified that my son or daughter thought this way, acted in this fashion and refrained from taking a stand against this 21st century inexcusable behavior!” \n\nErin Ness Carter, a mother living in the Iowan district, remarked that “ for the supporters of one team from a primarily white part of town to paint themselves as the ‘team of the USA’ it strongly implies that the other team, the less white team, is less American. ” \n\n… \n\nOne Valley High School student, Dayna Dunnwald, noted that the school’s students had dressed with a USA-theme instead of their black and orange school colors “many times in the past.” \n\n\"A lot of people were very upset about it,” explained DeNasja Spencer, a sophomore at Des Moines North, to KCCI . “Even if that was their theme for the game, I feel like they should have switched that because everyone knows North is a more diverse school.” \nValley High students were forced to issue a statement in response to the allegations of racism: \n“We are deeply sorry if we have offended anyone in any way,” reads the statement, in part. \n\n“We have traditionally dressed in such a fashion for great games such as the one last night. Everyone here at Valley has immense respect not only for your team and players but for your community as a whole. Please know that our intent was in no way to offend or demean—just to support our own team in a way we have done before.” \nThat Valley High students were essentially forced to say they are “deeply sorry” for the incident is a travesty in and of itself. \nDo we now live in a country where wearing the colors of the Star Spangled Banner can be construed as racist because they are somehow insensitive to diverse groups of people? \nLast time we checked, and calls us crazy, we’re living in America, where our national colors happen to be… red… white… and blue. \nNext we’ll be told that a woman wearing a white dress or someone wearing a Gadsden flag t-shirt is also racist. Oh, wait. Too late.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:46:24.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
