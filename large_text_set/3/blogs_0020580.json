Ours too. Kaytranada took to Twitter last night to announce their fresh sonic alliance.\nBrand new @LoU_pHELPS https://t.co/t0doG3wKej pic.twitter.com/P366vrmH9b \n— KAYTRANADA (@KAYTRANADA) March 22, 2017 \n\nThe rising producer shows no signs of repeating old patterns or slowing down anytime soon. Since last year’s insanely dope album 99.9% , he’s been working with big names like Alicia Keys and André 3000 , but also keeping it local with Canadian homies like Cadence Weapon – providing beats for his track “My Crew (Wooo),” which was one of our best tracks of February . Check out “My Forte” with its warm, soul-infused vocal sample and signature Kaytra beats that are unquestionably sick below.\n\nRevisit Kaytranada’s “You’re the One” ft. SYD below.\n\nIn other music happenings, Night Lovell rolled through COLORS Berlin to perform his track “Boy Red” in their studio. Peep that right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T11:52:35.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
