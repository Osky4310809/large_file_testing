Gradually, you accumulate the parts of her that are gone. Just when the day comes — when there’s a particular missing part that overwhelms you with the feeling that she’s gone, forever — there comes another day, and another specifically missing part.” \n–John Irving, A Prayer for Owen Meany \n“What we have once enjoyed deeply we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us.” \n–Helen Keller \n“The risk of love is loss, and the price of loss is grief – But the pain of grief is only a shadow when compared with the pain of never risking love.” \n–Hilary Stanton Zunin \n“I don’t think of all the misery, but of all the beauty that remains.” \n–Anne Frank \n“You will lose someone you can’t live without, and your heart will be badly broken, and the bad news is that you never completely get over the loss of your beloved. But this is also the good news. They live forever in your broken heart that doesn’t seal back up. And you come through. It’s like having a broken leg that never heals perfectly – that still hurts when the weather gets cold, but you learn to dance with the limp.” \n–Anne Lamott \n“I should know enough about loss to realize that you never really stop missing someone-you just learn to live around the huge gaping hole of their absence.” \n–Alyson Noel, Evermore \n“There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.” \n–Washington Irving \n“… And here am I, budding among the ruins with only sorrow to bite on, as if weeping were a seed and I the earth’s only furrow.” \n–Pablo Neruda, “Lightless Suburb” \n“There are no happy endings. Endings are the saddest part, So just give me a happy middle And a very happy start.” \n–Shel Silverstein, A Light in the Attic \n“Believe me, every heart has its secret sorrows, which the world knows not, and oftentimes we call a man cold, when he is only sad.” \n–Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Hyperion \n“My life closed twice before its close; It yet remains to see If Immortality unveil A third event to me, So huge, so hopeless to conceive, As these that twice befell. Parting is all we know of heaven, And all we need of hell.” \n–Emily Dickinson \n“While grief is fresh, every attempt to divert only irritates. You must wait till it be digested, and then amusement will dissipate the remains of it.” \n–Samuel Johnson \n“Sometimes, only one person is missing, and the whole world seems depopulated.” \n–Alphonse de Lamartine, Méditations Poétiques \n“The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen nor even touched, but just felt in the heart.” \n–Helen Keller", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:21:19.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
