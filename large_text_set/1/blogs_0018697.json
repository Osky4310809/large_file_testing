Additionally, the snippet the rapper posted to break the news truly put listeners in a trance as he spits gripping bars from the very intro of the track. \nAnd as promised, Joey has released the single \"Land Of The Free\" and it is as legendary and important as we thought it would be. The Pro Era spitta ethers the whole track and delivers bars that leave you questioning the validity of social constructs and to an extent, your own identity. \nThis release serves as the first single from his upcoming album AABA and while there is no release date for the project, this track should definitely hold us over until more details emerge. \nCheck out the new track here and grab a download of the track here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T06:36:05.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
