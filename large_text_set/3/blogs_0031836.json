I think his comments are over the top.”\nOn O’Leary’s threats to provinces, Kenney said: “I don’t actually understand what it is he’s proposing to do.”\n“If he’s trying to tie totally extraneous issues into . . . health and social transfers, that doesn’t make much sense to me.”\nKenney, an MP between 1997 and 2016 who was a key player in Harper’s cabinets, said he would not endorse any of the 14 candidates running for the Conservative leadership. Tuesday is the deadline for holding a party membership to be able to vote in the May contest.\nRelated Kevin O’Leary says he would ‘coerce’ provinces to adopt his economic policies Paula Simons: O’Leary’s ‘vicious poisonous toxic’ attack on Alberta self-determination should offend us all Don Braid: Jason Kenney wins Alberta PC leadership with promise to unite the right— now comes the hard part ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:25:22.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
