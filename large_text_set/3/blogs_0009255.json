The investigation in Britain seems to be grinding to a halt and they want to rule him out of the case if not rule him in. \n“Then detectives know they have done everything in their power to try to solve the case.

That will extend the search for ­Madeleine until September. \nHer doctor parents Kate and Gerry McCann , of Rothley, Leics, have always believed their daughter is still alive.

But they are taking the new lead so seriously that top Whitehall ­officials are being briefed on its progress, it is ­understood. \nThe £13million hunt for Madeleine was due to end within weeks. But the extra cash came after a“special grant funding” appeal from the Met when the new lead came to light. Scotland Yard said: “Inquiries are ongoing.” The Ocean Club would not comment last night.
