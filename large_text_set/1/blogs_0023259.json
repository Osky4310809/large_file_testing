The order also freezes refugee admissions for 120 days. \n\"There is no evidence that refugees—the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation—are a threat to national security,\" CAIR national litigation director Lena Masri said in a release. The group says it will announce details of the lawsuit Monday.
