He hurdled a lunging tackle from Lejeune to win a free-kick and force Yoel to push his bouncing strike to safety. \nAt the end of a wonderful 31st-minute move, Messi had a shot blocked but Denis Suarez was on hand to drill superbly into the bottom-left corner from 20 yards. \nNeymar and Arda Turan saw close-range efforts blocked by Yoel, with Messi the provider on both occasions. \nMessi predictably took centre stage five minutes into the second period as he drove forward from midfield and found Luis Suarez on the right. \nYoel darted out towards the Uruguay's curling ball to the far post but Messi was unruffled and slotted a half-volley nonchalantly home. \nLuis Suarez then capitalised on a dreadful error from Florian Lejeune to make it 19 for the campaign. \nNeymar has not been as prolific as his illustrious attacking colleagues this term but scored for the first time in LaLiga since October when Eibar were picked apart on the break in stoppage time. \nBarca remain third in La Liga but are back to within two points of rivals Real Madrid at the summit and one behind Sevilla in second. \n\"We have been looking to kick off a run of positive results and let's hope this is the start,\" Luis Enrique said afterwards. And he added: \"Busquets' injury doesn't look as bad as we first thought.\" \nIf that is true, it is good news for Barca, with some big games ahead in the coming weeks, including the Champions League last-16, first-leg clash away to Paris Saint-Germain on February 14. \nMessi is almost always a guarantee in such fixtures, but Busquets is essential for Barca and even though Rakitic did well in the role of 'pivot' on Sunday. \nLuis Enrique will be crossing his fingers that the Spain midfielder returns sooner rather than later.
