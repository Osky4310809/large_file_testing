The film uses both the original Judas Contract storyline and a story from the same run of comics to bring both Brother Blood and Deathstroke to fight against the Teen Titans in one film. \nPrior to direct home distribution of the film, Warner Brothers will be hosting two showings of the movie at WonderCon — one showing on Friday, March 31 and a matinee showing on Sunday, April 2. \nChristina Ricci ( Zelda, Sleepy Hollow, The Addams Family ) and the late Miguel Ferrer ( NCIS: Los Angeles, RoboCop, Crossing Jordan ) join the already established Teen Titans voice cast as Terra and Deathstroke, respectively. Returning Titans actors include Sean Maher ( Firefly/Serenity, Batman: Bad Blood ) as Nightwing, Taissa Farmiga ( American Horror Story ) as Raven, Jake T. Austin ( Wizards of Waverly Place, The Fosters ) as Blue Beetle, Brandon Soo Hoo ( Tropic Thunder, From Dusk Til Dawn: The Series ) as Beast Boy, Kari Wahlgren ( Phineas and Ferb, Legion of Superheroes ) as Starfire, and Stuart Allan ( Batman vs. Robin, Batman: Bad Blood ) as Robin/Damian. Gregg Henry ( Scandal, The Killing, Payback ) voices the villainous Brother Blood. \nOther actors and characters joining the cast include Meg Foster as Mother Mayhem, Crispin Freeman as Speedy, Masasa Moyo as Bumblebee, and Jason Spisak as Kid Flash, returning to the role he performed in the fan-favorite Young Justice series. \nTeen Titans: The Judas Contract is directed by Sam Liu, written by Ernie Altbacker, and produced by EP Sam Register, Supervising Producer James Tucker, and co-Producer Alan Burnett. The full list of special features, which include a first look at the next film Batman and Harley Quinn , a look back at Wolfman and Perez's acclaimed run on the comic, and a featurette on Deathstroke, follows. \nAre you excited for Warner Bros. next foray into the DC Animated Universe?
