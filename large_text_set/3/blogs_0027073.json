Advertisement \nA good photo is a properly exposed photo, and all that means is the right amount of light hits the photo in all the right places. I always had a vague understanding of my camera’s exposure settings. I knew they had something to do with the lighting situation. But when I bothered to learn how exposure actually works, my photos went from “that’s cute” to “wow, that actually doesn’t suck.” \nExposure depends on three factors: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO speed , which is also referred to as the “exposure triangle.” Advertisement \nNot all cameras will allow you to change these settings, but if you’re at all interested in taking photos that don’t completely suck, it’s worth learning how they work nonetheless. Aperture \nAperture is measured in f-stops and it’s basically the amount of light your lens lets in. A wide aperture lets in more light, and the wider the aperture, the lower the f-stop (f/1.0 is pretty wide). So what’s with the f? \nThe f/stop is a ratio. As photographer Matt Cole explains, it’s the ratio between the diameter of the aperture in the lens and the lens’s focal length. He further explains : Sponsored \nThe focal length is generally measured in millimeters, so we’ll stick with those as our unit of measure. On a 50mm lens, f/2 is saying that the diameter of the aperture is 25mm. The ratio is: 50/25 = 2. \nIt gets a little more complicated than that, but for photography neophytes like me, all you really need to know is that the f/stop measures how much light your camera allows in. Wide apertures will have a lower number, letting in a lot of light, and narrow apertures will have a higher number, letting in less light. When you shoot something super bright, like the moon, you want a narrow aperture. It’s sort of like a window on a bright day—you don’t need to open the curtains very wide before light floods the room. On a rainy day, though, you might need to open them as wide as possible to get any light in the room at all. Shutter Speed \nWhile aperture measures dimension, shutter speed measures time: how long your camera’s shutter is open to let in the light. The faster the shutter opens and closes, the less light can get in. If it’s open for a long time, it will let in quite a bit of light. When you shoot photos of the night sky and want to capture the stars, you’ll have a long shutter speed because you need all the light you can get at night (unless you’re shooting the moon, which is already bright). Advertisement \nIf you let in too much light, your photos can look blurry. This can happen if you move the camera, too. Going back to the night sky example, this is why it’s important to keep your camera extremely stable—otherwise, you can get blurry stars or light trails (on the other hand, if you know what you’re doing, this is kind of a cool trick) . When you’re trying to take a photo of a hummingbird or something else in action, though, you want a super quick shutter speed. This way, you get just enough light to capture one flap of the bird’s wings, as opposed to keeping it open longer and capturing a few flaps which then translate to a blurry bird. \nShutter speeds are measured in mere fractions of a second. An action shot might call for a shutter speed of 1/1200 seconds. But this varies depending on the image. If you’re taking a night sky photo or trying to get cool light trails, you might want to keep the shutter open for up to 30 seconds. Your settings depend on the image you’re trying to get, the lighting, and your other two exposure settings. ISO Speed \nISO is the third part of the triangle. It stands for International Standards Organization , as it’s a standardized scale for measuring sensitivity to light. Advertisement \nIn film photography, ISO tells you how sensitive film is to incoming light. In digital photography, your camera has its own sensor with its own ISO settings. The lower the ISO number, the less sensitive your camera is to light and the darker your photo will be. You can take a brighter picture without flash by adjusting the ISO upward . The problem is, a too-high ISO can take all the detail out of your photo. The Bastard’s Book of Photography puts it this way : \nFirst of all, you want to keep ISO as low as possible. Unlike with shutter speed and aperture, there really isn’t a good reason to have higher-than-needed ISO. Because no one really wants the effect that high ISO creates...It creates noise, random pixelation that can smudge the fine detail in an image. I suppose that some photographers do enjoy this look when it evokes the “grain” texture that sensitive film has. But as colored pixels, it’s not usually flattering. \nIn auto mode, your camera should try to pick the lowest ISO setting possible for the scene. However, you can dig into the setting in manual mode to adjust for night shots or any other situations when the lighting is less than ideal. The Exposure Settings for Five Types of Photos \nI won’t pretend to be a professional or even a good photographer, but once I learned the exposure triangle and how each factor works together, I was surprised at how much better my photos came out. Here are a few examples and the exposure settings I used. The Moon \nMoon photographers follow something called the Looney 11 Rule. The “11” refers to the f-stop, which seems to be the most important exposure setting here. Here’s what the rule calls for specifically , depending on the moon: Advertisement Full moon: Shutter speed at 1/125, aperture at f/11, and ISO 250 Quarter moon: Shutter speed at 1/60, aperture at f/11, and ISO 250 Thin crescent moon: Shutter speed at 1/15, aperture at f/2.8, and ISO 250 \nThese settings will get you in the ballpark, but when you shoot your own moon photo, play around with the settings a bit to see what yields the best results. \nThe above photo isn’t the best picture of the moon that’s ever been taken, but it beats the glowing bulb photos I used to take of the moon, where it was indistinguishable from a street lamp. Advertisement \nThe settings I used for the above photo: Aperture: f/11 Shutter speed: 1/320 ISO250 \nNot any lens will do with moon photos, though . You’ll need a telephoto lens with a focal length of at least 300mm. Also, use a tripod to make sure your camera is stabilized, because even a small move can make your photo blurry and ruin it. I took about twenty pictures of a blurry moon before I got the one above, and I also used the camera’s timer to make sure there was no movement. Street Photography \nWhen you’re out with your camera on the street, you often have to be pretty fast to get the shot you want.
