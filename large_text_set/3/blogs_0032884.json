New York Times Bestseller * Los Angeles Times Bestseller * Washington Post Bestseller * San Francisco Chronicle Bestseller * Chicago Tribune Bestseller \"A story to make you believe in the soul-sustaining power of fiction.\"— Los Angeles Times Book Review After the sinking of a cargo ship, a solitary lifeboat remains bobbing on the wild blue Pacific. The only survivors from the wreck are a sixteen-year-old boy named Pi, a hyena, a wounded zebra, an orangutan—and a 450-pound royal bengal tiger. The scene is set for one of the most extraordinary and beloved works of fiction in recent years. Universally acclaimed upon publication, Life of Pi is a modern classic. From Publishers Weekly Apr 08, 2002 – A tinted review in adult Forecasts indicates a book that's of exceptional importance to our readers, but hasn't received a starred or boxed review.LIFE OF PIYann Martel. Harcourt, $25 (336p) A fabulous romp through an imagination by turns ecstatic, cunning, despairing and resilient, this novel is an impressive achievement \"a story that will make you believe in God,\" as one character says. The peripatetic Pi (n the much-taunted Piscine) Patel spends a beguiling boyhood in Pondicherry, India, as the son of a zookeeper. Growing up beside the wild beasts, Pi gathers an encyclopedic knowledge of the animal world. His curious mind also makes the leap from his native Hinduism to Christianity and Islam, all three of which he practices with joyous abandon. In his 16th year, Pi sets sail with his family and some of their menagerie to start a new life in Canada. Halfway to Midway Island, the ship sinks into the Pacific, leaving Pi stranded on a life raft with a hyena, an orangutan, an injured zebra and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. After the beast dispatches the others, Pi is left to survive for 227 days with his large feline companion on the 26-foot-long raft, using all his knowledge, wits and faith to keep himself alive. The scenes flow together effortlessly, and the sharp observations of the young narrator keep the tale brisk and engaging. Martel's potentially unbelievable plot line soon demolishes the reader's defenses, cleverly set up by events of young Pi's life that almost naturally lead to his biggest ordeal. This richly patterned work, Martel's second novel, won Canada's 2001 Hugh MacLennan Prize for Fiction. In it, Martel displays the clever voice and tremendous storytelling skills of an emerging master. FYI:Booksellers would be wise to advise readers to browse through Martel's introductory note. His captivating honesty about the genesis of his story is almost worth the price of the book itself. © Publishers Weekly Great book but bad ebook copy. Purchase somewhere else. by AnActor1 I love this book and read it a few years ago in hard copy. Now reading a lot of things on my iPad, I decided to buy it on iBooks.However, when I came to the final chapters, not only does there appear to be a super confusing typo (talking about mixing up two towns with similar names, both are typed in this ebook identically, ruining the point of the chapter and making it highly confusing), but also, the entire final chapter is prefaced by saying that the writer is representing multiple languages with differing fonts. Every word is in exactly the same font. Once again the ebook takes out the creativity of the author and the point of much of that chapter.I definitely recommend the book but would suggest either purchasing it in paper form, or on a competing app if there is a better copy on kindle, etc.If someone from apple corrects this, please let me know and I'll change my review... Don't give up if you're Christian. by Meanngirl When I read the reviews saying \"don't read if you're Christian\" -- It upsets me that that is the only content people can take away from this book. I'm a Christian and read the whole book, and was not offended. In no part does he out rightly reject God. In fact, the whole book is him praying to God and trusting in him. I think this book actually helped me understand the views of different people and could help me connect with more people and bring up God and beliefs. I benefited. I don't think you should just give up on a book because the main character is Islam or Hindu. (In several parts he takes on Christian practices). It's true there are people with different religions than just Christianity. Besides from the deep religious undertones, I loved this book. Quite a turning plot twist at the end. It took me a while to read -- but I'm glad I stuck with it. If you're into somewhat philosophical themes you'll love this book. It is a bit gory so if you don't like graphic content such as detailed descriptions of death-- maybe not for you. Overall a great book. And I can't wait to see how it is portrayed in the upcoming movie. My Favorite Book Ever! by KaylaGuadagnolo I read this when I was in 8th grade, and thorougly enjoyed it! The power of the symbolism that is used in this book ranks up there with Lord of the Flies, and I really suggest reading it! :) Customers Also Bought", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:37:26.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
