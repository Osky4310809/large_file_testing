Samsung Galaxy J7 (2017) spotted on GFXBench, 5.5-inch HD display and Nougat in tow By - February 2, 2017 “The Galaxy J7 (2017) will offer an octa-core SoC, 2GB RAM, 16GB storage and 8MP/5MP cameras” \nA couple of weeks ago, the upcoming Samsung Galaxy J7 (2017) was spotted on Geekbench , revealing a couple of its specifications. 91mobiles had exclusively covered the leaked renders and 360-degree video of the phone earlier. Now, ahead of the unveiling, the Galaxy J7 (2017) has popped up on the interwebs once again. \nThe Galaxy J7 (2017) has been spotted on GFXBench benchmarking website. As per the listing, the phone will sport a 5.5-inch HD display, and boot Android Nougat out of the box. It will be powered by a 1.5GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7870 processor, mated to Mali T830 graphics and 2GB of RAM. The device will come with 16GB of internal memory, an 8MP rear snapper and a 5MP selfie shooter. \nIt’s worth mentioning that last month’s Galaxy J7 (2017) listing on Geekbench had suggested that it would be powered by a Snapdragon 625 SoC. So, it’s likely that the brand will launch the device in a couple of variants depending on the region. The phone is expected to be out in the coming weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:34:20.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
