Many civil complaints were submitted especially after the February 5 and 12 broadcast.” \nDuring the specific episodes, the 11-year-old contestant Han Byul came out wearing a school uniform and performed Britney Spears’“Oops! I Did It Again.” When it aired, viewers criticized the show, saying, “It was uncomfortable to watch a child perform such a sexual song while wearing a school uniform.” \nA source from the Korea Communications Standards Commission also added, “The show will be reevaluated for making minors perform songs with such provocative lyrics, which violates section 45 article 6 of the broadcasting review regulations.” The Korea Communications Standards Commission will be reviewing the show on March 15 at 3 p.m. KST. \nCheck out the latest episode of “K-Pop Star 6” below: \nWhat are your thoughts on this issue?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T13:13:01.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
