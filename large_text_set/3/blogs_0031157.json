It was a well kept secret and only Gauri Khan , Manish Malhotra and Kareena Kapoor knew about it. The twins are unfortunately still in the hospital as they were born prematurely but Karan goes and visits them ever so often. Yesterday, he took his close friend and director Ayan Mukherjee to meet the babies, making him the first to visit them at the hospital. Aww! \nWe hope they get home soon. :) 19", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:12:02.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
