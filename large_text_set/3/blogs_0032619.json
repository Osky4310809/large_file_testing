From the way your marriage progresses, to the way you deal with the ups and downs, here's a zodiac prediction of what your married life is going to look like. Aries (March 21 - April 19) \nA spring wedding means that you both enjoy adventure, spontaneity and independence. Your romance will have a lot of unexpected surprises, romantic dinners, and a wide sense of space that you both love and respect. Taurus (April 20 - May 20) \nYou and your hubby believe in living life king sized. You love the fancy things in life, and you will always strive to do things perfectly. While that might cause some trouble, your marriage will also always serve as the big constant in your life. No matter what happens, you can always go back to this person and begin again. Gemini (May 21 - June 20) \nYou love to talk thing out so, miscommunication in this marriage will be at a minimum. However you will also get bored easily of the monotonous way of life, so you have to constantly strive to shake things up. Cancer (June 21 - July 22) \nYou are the perfect homebodies. You'd any day pick a night on the couch with pizza over a romantic dinner, and you don't care what people think. However, danger lies in the fact that because you are so caught up in your own world you might sometimes lose track of the other people in your lives. Leo (July 23 - August 22) \nLeo couples live life with a lot of passion. While your love for drama might sometimes create unnecessary complications in the marriage, you both will always forgive each other because you believe in forgiving and forgetting. Virgo (August 23 - September 22) \nYou both love the little things in life as much as you love the bigger gestures, so it doesn't take much for you to be happy. You both are going to be each other's biggest support and no matter how much other people try to interfere, you'll always work things around. Libra (September 23 - October 22) \nOctober is pretty much the start of the marriage month, and there is a very big reason for it too. Libra is known to be the sign that defines marriage, with the two partners balancing each other out perfectly. Your marriage is number one priority for both of you, and that helps you deal with most things with ease. Scorpio (October 23 - November 21) \nScorpion couples are very intimate, and they always strive to keep the romance alive in a marriage more than anything else. And because you both are so passionate and connected, you are also bound to get a tad too worked up when a third person (be it a friend or a family member) tries to get between your equation. Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21) \nThe Saggi couple is always taking risks in the hopes of making things better in the future. While that's great, you also need to focus on the present and enjoy life the way it is right now. Capricorn (December 22 - January 19) \nIf you've had a winter wedding, it means that you also love doing things the traditional way. You always compare your marriage to your parents', as you believe that the older way of life was better than it is now. While other people might not always agree with your way of life, you both don't really care. Aquarius (January 20 - February 18) \nJust like the Aquarian sign, you love doing things in an unconventional way. You also love to be surrounded by people, which means that your home will always be filled with family and friends. However, you do have to work towards scheduling some us-time and being alone with each other. Pisces (February 19 - March 20) \nPisceans are known to be imaginative, creative, and living in their own sweet world. You and your hubby have your own set of rules in the marriage, and you believe in giving each other the space to grow as individuals first.
