Maybe websites are not loading, are slower than usual or some links are outright broken. \nWell, before you blame your router or your internet service provider, you ought to know that there is a massive internet outage happening right now. \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is apparently having issues with portions of its S3 storage system and is currently affecting multiple sites across the United States, particularly the ones located on the East Coast. \nAccording to an AWS tweet earlier today, the company was experiencing \"high error rates\" on the S3 system. S3 is experiencing high error rates. We are working hard on recovering. \n— Amazon Web Services (@awscloud) February 28, 2017 \nThe outage is reported to have begun at 12:45 p.m. Eastern Time (9:45 AM Pacific Time) and has brought down or at least partially affected multiple websites. \nSome of the websites affected are as follows: Airbnb, Down Detector, Freshdesk, Pinterest, SendGrid, Snapchat's Bitmoji, Time, Buffer, Business Insider, Chef, Citrix, CNBC, Codecademy, Coursera, Cracked, Docker, Expedia, Expensify, Giphy, Heroku, Home Chef, iFixit, IFTTT, isitdownrightnow.com, Lonely Planet, Mailchimp, Medium, Microsoft's HockeyApp, News Corp, Quora, Razer, Slack, Sprout Social, Travis CI, Trello, Twilio, Unbounce, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Zendesk. \nWe at Komando.com experienced similar issues with our ad partner, PowerInbox. If you received one of our newsletters and some of the spots and links are broken, this is most certainly a direct effect of the current AWS outage. \nAmazon has not specified the reason nor divulged any details concerning the cause of the S3 storage system issue but it stated in a later AWS tweet that they \"believe they understand the root cause and are working hard at repairing.\" For S3, we believe we understand root cause and are working hard at repairing. Future updates across all services will be on dashboard. \n— Amazon Web Services (@awscloud) February 28, 2017 \nUntil then we can only hope that the outage was not caused by an attack similar to the Dyn DNS server denial-of-service outage that occurred last year. \nWe'll be following this developing story as it happens so make sure you check back on komando.com for updates. \nPlease share this information with everyone.
