Check Your Reservations to Save Money/Points! \nThe real benefit of these sales is for you to check your existing Southwest reservation and see if the fare is any cheaper right now. This is very common because many people will book as far out as they can when the schedule opens to ensure they have the flight. Then, with Southwest‚Äôs generous cancellation/change policy, you can make changes to the reservation and always make sure you are booked at the lowest price. \nCancellation and Change Policy \nIf you have already booked your tickets in the past, you can still take advantage of the sale. Southwest has the best cancellation/rebooking policy of the US airlines. Basically, as long as you cancel by 10 minutes before the flight, you get the points back in your account for free and with no penalty. That means you are free to make any changes you want without any problems or loss of points or cash! \nCheck Your Already-Booked Reservations For Price Difference \nSo, now is the time to search for your tickets within this sale and see if you have a better price available now than when you had booked it. If the price has dropped, you simply select to change the flight and look at the same dates and flights again. Once you go through and confirm, you will receive a refund of the difference in miles and the cash for the taxes will be transferred for the new ticket. \nIn 1 Minute, You Can Have Your Points Back! \nThe whole process takes less than 60 seconds and you could save a lot of money or points! If you had booked your ticket in the past using cash, you will receive a refund in the form of a credit that is usable for 1 year from the time you originally booked the ticket. If you booked it with points, you will receive the points back in your account for the difference. Summary \nIt is a great time to lock in reservations now and then you can always change later ( for free ) if the dates or travel no longer suits you. If you booked a while ago, you will have a decent shot at getting some money/points back with this sale. That is always a good thing and a great reason to shop with Southwest. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:32:23.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
