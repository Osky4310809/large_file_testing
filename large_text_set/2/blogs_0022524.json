UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 2 hours ago 4 \nIt would seem that having three drummers wasn't enough for King Crimson, as the prog fathers have added another skin basher to their lineup - Mr. Bill Rieflin, who has returned from his KC sabbatical and will now join the four-headed drumming brigade alongside Gavin Harrison, Pat Mastelotto, and Jeremy Stacey. \nMastermind Robert Fripp stated : \"Existing repertoire will be re-calibrated for the about-to-be-becoming King Crimson Double Quartet Formation. King Crimson is the first group of which Jeremy has been a full-member. Jeremy became a full-contributor to the Seven-Headed Beast during the 2017 EuroTour, a remarkable achievement for Jezza to adopt the entire repertoire on both drums and keyboards. Bill is presently returning from his Sabbatical, and now The Beast has Eight Heads. Jeremy and Bill are both multi-instrumental, so King Crimson is likely to be making a lot more noise than before. Even.\" \nAdditionally, the almighty Bob announced that the eight-headed beast is set to tour North America this year, also revealing that the current hot KC topics include \"Spotify, KC touring in 2017 and 2018.\" \nAlso, \"a King Crimson 12-inch single is being planned for April: a stomper IMO. It's a Number One!\" \nExciting times.
