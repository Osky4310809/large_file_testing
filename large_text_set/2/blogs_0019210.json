And bonus points for the device being powered on.\nNow, it’s difficult to say how authentic these pictures are. But they line up pretty well with what we’ve heard. Which is, the phone will sport an edge-to-edge display and the same terrific features carried over from previous Galaxy devices.\nAnd, as one of the photos shows, the phone will support onscreen navigation buttons, seemingly confirming Samsung is done with capacitive buttons for good. Finally.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com In addition to getting a glimpse of the S8’s onscreen buttons, the photos also appear to show the device will support always-on display technology, a feature that was widely adopted last year.\nBased on the rest of the photos, it’s tough to tell what else is new. There sure are a lot of sensors on the front, one of which is no doubt for an improved front-facing camera. Outside of that, the Galaxy S8 is expected to sport an iris scanner, so chances are one of those sensors is dedicated to that as well.\nIt looks like a more advanced Galaxy S7 Edge Assuming these photos are real, we’re big fans of the direction the Galaxy S8 is headed. Although, it must be noted, that the phone’s alleged placement of the fingerprint sensor (right next to the rear-facing camera) is odd.\nBy now, we know virtually all there is to know about the Galaxy S8. We should get official word from Samsung sometime next month, followed by an alleged April release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:14:55.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
