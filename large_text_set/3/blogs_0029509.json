We didn't choose this day to hurt the other people who are concerned,” Lubitz said. “We chose this day because we would get the most attention for our message. Attention for the message that at the moment of the crash our son was not depressive.” #Lubitz final confession: Germanwings co-pilot was losing sight & suffered from insomnia https://t.co/z6JrArWdOD pic.twitter.com/xQzMjFIX4D — RT (@RT_com) March 5, 2016 \nChristoph Kumpa, the Düsseldorf prosecutor who led the investigation, said Friday that Lubitz had “suffered for months from insomnia, was anxious about his eyesight, and was suffering doubt,\" while also asserting that prosecutors, “never claimed that [Lubitz] was depressive,” reports The Local . \n\"It was already clear [for the investigators], that it was the pilot, so all other possibilities can be ignored. It has to be the pilot. And that is dangerous, because then things are suddenly blended out which possibly could have been related,\" van Beveren told the press. \n“We all have presumptions, but presumptions are not evidence. And media are reporters, not judges.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T05:59:58.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
