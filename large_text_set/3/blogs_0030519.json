It was the first time he was away from his family for two months, and not surprisingly, his doting sister wrote a long message of how she missed him and wanted to see him back soon. But all she got in return was a 'thumbs up' emoji. His father had it slightly better, when he sent him a long congratulatory message just after Shreyas had stroked his maiden first-class double ton. \"I got two thumbs up,\" his father proudly expressed. Words, in Shreyas's world, are a useless virtue to possess. \nHe is half Tamilian, half Mangalorian, but can't speak either of the languages. His flow with Marathi is better, but it is best used to say 'Zaanaar to ata' (He will get dismissed now). \nThere was a brief call he made to his father on the evening of March 23, conversation of which went like this: \nShreyas Iyer (in Delhi): Daddy, I've got a call up, I'm leaving tomorrow \nSantosh Iyer (Shreyas's Father): Ya, Vizag right? \nShreyas : No, Dharamsala. \nSantosh : Dharamsala for what? \nShreyas : They have asked me to join the Indian team. \nMoments after the call was disconnected, the most awaited news of Adarsh Nagar had finally arrived. Shreyas was selected as cover for Virat Kohli for the fourth Test against Australia. The elation in the family was obvious, but for the entire society where not just Shreyas was born and brought up but even his father grew up, it seemed to be as personal. The celebrations kicked off, Shreyas's friends came home and the laddoos too, were in, in time. All of it must have been rehearsed so many times over in their dreams, but this Thursday saw it coming to light. Shreyas's parents, who had avoided sweets for so many years, had their share of ladoos too. While the phones in the house never stopped buzzing, as if in some parallel world, Shreyas had once again switched off, much like he had done in the past. \nFor a reserved person that he is off the field, he finds his expression through sports. And like so many others, he brings a bit of his personality into his game: Uncluttered and uncomplicated. It was his answer 'I am blank' to the question of 'what are you thinking when the bowler comes on to bowl' that impressed the selectors at the Under-16 level. \nBut, over the years, exposure in England, couple of IPL seasons, travelling with the A side and the Mumbai team has helped him grow as an individual as much as it has aided him evolve as a cricketer. Today, he is a confident and witty individual while facing the press. In many ways, his journey has been far smoother after making his first-class debut than it was while growing through the ranks of Mumbai cricket. \nFor as talented as you are, you are never the most talented cricketer in Mumbai. Even Sachin Tendulkar wasn't. There is a hustle to find the best coaches, who are coaching the best players in the city. And if the best coaches don't train close by, it isn't odd to find players travelling 50-odd kilometeres in crowded trains with heavy kit bags everyday. Shreyas, too had to go beyond the boundaries of Worli to find a good coach. In Shivaji Park Gymkhana, he found his first club, and coaches - Pravin Amre and Padmakar Shivalkar. \nHe changed his school, took his football and academics a little less seriously as everything started centreing around cricket through the teens. His progress through age-group went unnoticed with the likes of Sarfaraz Khan, Armaan Jaffer and Prithvi Shaw hogging the attention in the Mumbai maidans. For a long time, the trio was expected to carry forward the legacy of Mumbai's school of batting, be the next Mumbaikar to represent India. \nFor a batting culture that is built around not throwing away your wicket, Shreyas has been a misfit. He violates the most basic priciple of Mumbai batting. And thus, growing through the ranks was an arduous task, as much for him as his coaches who believed in his potential. \nHe credits his turnaround to Vinod Raghavan, his Under-16 coach. When Shreyas was struggling with form and missed out on a couple of seasons for Mumbai age-group teams, it was Raghavan who spotted that there was 'something special about him'. \"He was getting out for 30s and 40s and not getting the big scores. But I noticed that he was an excellent player of spin when he clobbered the Gujarat spinners on a track that was turning square. It was a bit tough to convince the selectors, but once he scored a century in a trial match, they were convinced,\" Raghavan recounts. \nEven after Shreyas was selected to the national side at Under-19 level, Raghavan's advice over the phone was simple: \"It is this cricket that has brought you till here, continue playing in a similar fashion.\" \nHe progessed fine from thereon to go on to play for India in the 2014 Under-19 World Cup. Despite being one of the consistent scorers before the tournament and during the World Cup, he didn't find a regular place in the starting XI. Never earlier or never later was he more uncomfortable channelising his disappointment. But soon enough, he got the offer to play club cricket in England, a stint that happened to change him as a person. \n\"There were so many things that I had to do living on my own. I wasn't used to it. The experience there changed me as an individual.\" He finished among the top five run-getters and wicket-takers. For all his credentials as a batsman, it is bowling leagbreaks that gives him most joy. \nHis maiden first-class season began on a poor note. But Amre, the then Mumbai coach and his childhood coach, promoted him to Number 3 after he stroked a match-winning 75 at No 7, bailing his side out from a precarious situation against Uttar Pradesh. What followed was a season to remember - when he amassed 809 runs, remaining a shining light in an otherwise forgetable campaign for the side. \nBefore the season could end, he was picked by Delhi Daredevils for INR 2.6 crore - the highest for an uncapped player in the 2015 auction. It was Abhishek Nayar who broke the news about the intense bidding Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils got into to have his services. \"Initially, I thought they were joking. I realised it only when I saw a lot of messages on my phone after returning to the hotel room,\" Iyer recounted. \n\"The price tag also brings in a lot of burden,\" Amre, who was also Delhi Daredevils' batting coach, said. With no place in the middle order, Amre convinced head coach Gary Kirsten to try him out as an opener. \"But he proved himself.\" Iyer finished the season with 439 runs - highest for his franchise and eighth highest in the tournament to bag the Emerging Player of the Tournament. \nHe was drafted into the A side, where his returns were decent, if not exceptional. A question, however, kept doing the rounds - Was he just a one-season wonder or was there more to him? \nAll doubts were put to rest in the following season where he decimated attacks across the country in all forms of the game. In Ranji Trophy, he smashed 1321 runs at a strike rate of more than 90 to help Mumbai bag the title for the 41st time. The season was enough evidence that he belonged to a league far higher than India's domestic cricket. While the authoritative manner in which he scored runs was a pleasing sight, the way he would throw his wicket away was often cringeworthy. \nHis following season with India A and Delhi Daredevils weren't as good. Maybe it has to do with Rahul Dravid's coaching style, which is experimental in nature. Iyer has thrived when he is assured of his place in the team. A few more niggles and injuries further dented his Ranji Trophy campaign in 2016-17. Yet, he finished as Mumbai's highest run-getter for third successive season as his team reached the final. \nHe grew in confidence and matured as a player. If not in the short term, maybe his time under Dravid aided his game in the longer run. In the three years since making his first-class debut, he has been the highest run-getter in Indian domestic cricket. In the last two matches against international sides, his scores were 100 retd out (vs Bangladesh) and 202* off 210 balls (vs Australia in a match where the other 10 batsmen combined to score only 189 runs). He has done everything within his means to get the national call-up. \nAs the match day closes in, there is one general enquiry by his close ones - \"What's the update on Virat's injury?\" \nWhether or not Shreyas gets to play tomorrow, he is surely India's man for tomorrow . © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:06:38.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
