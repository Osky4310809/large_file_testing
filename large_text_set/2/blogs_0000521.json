I'm not happy with the result. I don't criticise the opponents. The opponent is fighting for their life. Every point is gold. \n\"They have to fight with everything they have and they tried to see what they would be allowed to do, the referee gave the feedback and then they were comfortable doing what they did for 90 minutes. \n\"I am not critical of them because if i was in their position, fighting for life, fighting for the point that can mean a lot for them in the end. I'm not critical of them at all.\" Mourinho's Manchester United drew 0-0 with Hull City (Photo: Getty) Read More Manchester United are hard to beat but draws just won't do for Jose Mourinho if they're to climb the table \nDo you think Oumar Niasse should have been sent off? \n\"I really don't understand why you ask me these questions since the beginning of the season. Because we would be much more, I don't know if professional is the word. \n\"If I was in your place I would not ask the manager, if I was in your place I would just say and write what I see, what I think, what is my opinion. \n\"If I was on your side I would not be asking the Manchester United manager. I would just, game after game, I would just write what is happening every game with us, if not every game, almost every game, because if I speak I am punished. I don't want to be punished.\" Mourinho cannot believe his side's inability to get the breakthrough (Photo: Julian Finney) \nOn his side's sluggish first half performance \n\"You know very slow start but big chances, big saves, total control. And then in the first half the opponents start doing what they made even more in the second half, the referees start allowing them to do in the first half and then I don't want to speak more about refereeing decisions because I repeat, if I was in your place, because I don't know, maybe it's changed, maybe your industry is going in another direction. \n\"For me, make journalism is to say the truth. You simply have to tell the truth. If you go game after game with Manchester United, and you see what happened with Manchester City what happened here with Burnley, West Ham, what happened with Stoke, almost everywhere. \n\"You do your job, you do a public service. Tell the truth, it's as simple as that. If the truth is that Manchester United in the first half didn't play well, so be it. We should play better in the first half than we did. Make journalism true. Don't ask me questions I cannot answer. \n\"You know clearly that I am different. I am different, the rules for me are different I am different in every thing. I watch my team in the hotel, I was forbidden to go to the stadium. My assistant had a six matches stadium ban, I didn't touch anyone. Yesterday one fourth official told to a manager, 'I very much enjoy your passion, so do what you want to do.' Today I was told sit down or I will send you to the stands. \n\"So everything is different for me, so don't ask me questions that will put me in a difficult situation. \n\"So to end the story, I just want to say simple: 0-0, great point for them, congratulations, bad point for us, we have to keep going. We have another game at the weekend.\" poll loading Is Jose Mourinho unfairly treated by referees? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T10:51:02.833+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
