Lucky for brides-to-be, Randy is getting back in the game with the introduction of his own bridal line that’s launching in April, Randy Fenoli Bridal. \nAs the former fashion director of Kleinfeld Bridal in NYC (where he’ll be showing his pieces come April 20) and a fashion designer himself, Fenoli has plenty of experience when it comes to outfitting brides for the big day that extends far beyond his well-known hosting duties. \nComprised of 25 debut pieces, Fenoli’s line will be priced between $1,500 to$3000 and will reportedly feature plenty of tonal beading and soft layers. As he told The Knot , “A wedding gown is the most important piece of clothing a woman will ever wear, so to be able to create something she loves is the most rewarding feeling for me.” He also went on to say how his hosting gig has actually helped to inspire his new collection, noting, “My deep connection to brides inspired each piece in my premiere collection and I am truly honored to be a part of making a women feel her most beautiful.” \nWe, for once, cannot wait to see the finished products: Just take a peek at this sketch he did in 1993 as part of The Diamond Collection. Gorgeous. \nHe also offered up another throwback via Instagram last month, writing, #sayyestothedress #ballgown.” Wowza! If his new designs are half as beautiful as these sketches, we’re already completely sold. \nWhat’s your favorite bridal line?
