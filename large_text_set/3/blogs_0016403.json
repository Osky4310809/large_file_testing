After all, the seemingly universally flattering metallic finish can't be popular forever, can it ? 1. Sunny Yellow \nA buttery yellow stove and hood is a sweet touch in this family ready cook space. We love how A3 Architects, Inc. worked the color into the countertop stools as well, resulting in a playful yet refined sunny spot. \nSee the rest of the house: Net Zero Scituate House at A3 Architects, Inc.

The teal covering adds the right dose of retro charm to her pastel-accented kitchen. (Image credit: Shoko Design ) 4. Mint Green \nSweet mint takes on an edgy attitude when paired with black cabinetry, butcher block countertops, and a matte black hood and oven combo in this kitchen by Shoko Design . Patterned tiles finish off the perfectly balanced look. (Image credit: Julia Steele ) 5. All White \nThere was once a time when white appliances elicited an ugh across the board from homeowners. Now, though, the right design results in a look that feels crisp and clean — even if the appliances aren't out-of-the-box new. (Image credit: That Nordic Feeling ) 5. Cherry Red \nThe quintessential retro red is so fun in this sunny Copenhagen kitchen from That Nordic Feeling . It looks especially clean and fresh against an all-white and light wood palette. \nSee more pics: Updated Kitchen at That Nordic Feeling (Image credit: The Room Edit ) 6. Royal Blue \nStriking blue reigns supreme in this victorian home at The Room Edit . A lighter shade of cabinetry pairs perfectly with a multi-colored fish scale backsplash and gorgeous blue range. \nTake a tour of the entire space: Striking Victorian House in Kent at The Room Edit (Image credit: Artichoke Design ) 7. Cool Copper \nReinvent metallics by swapping stainless steel for high-impact copper just like this kitchen from Artichoke Design . The additional pops of copper (pots, glassware, and edging around the hood) build onto the cohesive look. (Image credit: A+B Kasha ) 8. Inky Black \nBlack appliances are infinitely stylish, oui? This stunning Parisian spot by A+B Kasha is made more dramatic by pairing a black stove and hood with a bold \"backsplash\" of black paint. Très, très chic. \nTake a tour: St. Germain 3 at A+B Kasha More posts in The Smart Appliance Shopper", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:10:14.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
