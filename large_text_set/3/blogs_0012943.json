City, as they were back then, are third leading into Sunday’s fixture and Liverpool – ninth when they handed out that beating – sit fourth. Whether much else has really changed in the interim is moot but one unhappy development for Klopp has been the tailing-off of Philippe Coutinho’s form. Coutinho was one of the driving forces behind that win last season but, since returning in January from the ankle injury that laid him low for six weeks, has been nowhere near his devastating best. That has been one reason for Liverpool’s inconsistency and it was a sign of his malaise that Ben Woodburn was summoned from the bench to replace him last weekend as they struggled to break down Burnley. It is hard to see Coutinho dropping out of the starting lineup to face City – this looks a fine opportunity for Klopp’s team, who are reliably switched-on against top opposition and can capitalise on any post-Monaco dejection – but if Liverpool are to rediscover the magic of that carefree evening 16 months ago they will need him to find form quickly. NA Guardiola set for City clearout with 18 players at risk 3) A crucial moment in Wilshere’s career \nIf suggestions that Bournemouth are cooling on the idea of signing Jack Wilshere permanently this summer do not tell the former future of English football that he is in serious danger of squandering his serious talent, then it is tempting to conclude that nothing will. It is strange to think that Wilshere turned 25 in January – some players, such as Joe Cole or Shaun Wright-Phillips, aren’t meant to grow old – and even more perplexing that a player of his obvious class might not have a future at either Arsenal or Bournemouth. Injuries have played their part, of course, and the midfielder has endured some rotten luck during his stop-start career, but there have also been times when his attitude has been called into question. The sad thing is that Santi Cazorla’s absence means that Arsenal probably could have done with Wilshere recently; instead he has started on the bench in Bournemouth’s previous two matches. An unused substitute in the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford a fortnight ago , he did come on in the 85th minute against West Ham United last Saturday and had a hand in Josh King’s winner, sparking an attack with one of those little bursts through the middle. But Eddie Howe is no fool. He has praised Wilshere’s reaction to being dropped and explained it in tactical terms, saying that he wanted to pair King with another striker and play four in midfield. With Dan Gosling and Harry Arter playing well against West Ham, however, and Andrew Surman available for the visit of Swansea City after serving a one-match ban, Wilshere will have to work hard to regain his place.

Photograph: South/Si/Rex/Shutterstock 4) Boro to cut loose after losing Karanka? \nThere were always doubts, even in the Championship, over Aitor Karanka’s ability to configure a side with the right attacking balance. It seems he has always found it difficult to place full trust in offensive players and that inherent conservatism manifested itself in performances during a dour Premier League campaign in which Middlesbrough have rarely cut loose. Now that manager and club have parted company with slightly curious timing, is Manchester United’s visit an opportunity for a side that have not scored in their last four top-flight games to release the shackles? Perhaps. For one thing, Boro’s opponents lack Zlatan Ibrahimovic and will have played two high-intensity fixtures since the home team’s last game; for another, players such as Stewart Downing and the re-signed but barely used Patrick Bamford may be cleansed of any grievances against their ex-manager and ready to prove a point; for another, Craig Shakespeare has inspired a ferocious turnaround at Leicester City so why should another promotion from within, Steve Agnew, not mastermind something similar? Things are a little more complicated than that in reality but Karanka had been a brooding presence for too long and it will be interesting to see if his former charges play like men unburdened. They need the points desperately. NA Mourinho blames Pogba injury on crowded schedule 5) Son set to shine in Kane’s absence \nWith Harry Kane facing another spell on the sidelines, you could be forgiven for thinking that Vincent Janssen picked a good moment to open his account in open play for Tottenham Hotspur in last Sunday’s FA Cup thrashing of Millwall. But the Dutch forward has often been overlooked in recent weeks and while the 22-year-old could yet become a potent force if Mauricio Pochettino gives him time to adapt to the demands of the Premier League, there is precious little evidence at the moment that he is capable of standing in for a player who has scored 24 goals this season. What a cruel blow it is for Tottenham to lose Kane now. Bearing in mind how Tottenham struggled without him during the autumn months, his ankle injury could easily derail their hopes of finishing in the top four, unless Pochettino finds a way to reconfigure his attack. Plan A is unlikely to involve Janssen, who does not look mobile enough to start for a top Premier League side yet, and instead the responsibility of filling in for Kane will probably fall to Son Heung-min, who impressed up front in the win over Manchester City in October. Yet while the South Korean is nimble, inventive and capable of chipping in with important goals, he is comfortable starting in deeper positions and did not convince as a No9 during Kane’s earlier absence. Yes, Son scored a hat-trick in his last match, but Southampton’s defence is slightly better than Millwall’s. Tottenham could be in for a frustrating afternoon against Claude Puel’s side on Sunday.
