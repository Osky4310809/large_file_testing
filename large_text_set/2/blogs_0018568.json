Advertisement \nA statement from Harvard Foundation director S. Allen Counter lays out her philanthropic achievements thusly: \n“Rihanna has charitably built a state-of- the-art center for oncology and nuclear medicine to diagnose and treat breast cancer at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown, Barbados. \nShe has also created the Clara and Lionel Foundation Scholarship Program [named for her grandmother and grandfather] for students attending college in the U.S. from Caribbean countries, and supports the Global Partnership for Education and Global Citizen Project, a multiyear campaign that will provide children with access to education in over 60 developing countries, giving priority to girls and those affected by lack of access to education in the world today.” \nThose are all fantastic achievements and excellent uses of her time and her resources.

Another less notable but still significant achievement is this close-up of her nail game at the Grammys, which has made me seriously reconsider a square nail with a subtle French manicure. \nOther recipients of the Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian Award include James Earl Jones, U.N. Secretary Kofi Anan, tennis player Arthur Ashe and Malala. She’s in great company! Congratulations Rihanna!!
