Balang revealed that he was given an honorary license to teach Zumba in the Philippines. \nWhen asked whether he still used the exercise bike DeGeneres gifted him, Balang gagged, “Yes. Tapos, sabi ko kay mama, ‘Mama, pumayat na ba ko?’ Sabi ni mama, ‘no pa. Sige pa patuloy mo pa ‘yan (Yes, then I asked my mother, ‘Mama, am I losing weight?’ Mama replied, ‘Not yet, continue using it).” \nThis was Balang’s fourth guesting on the popular American talk show. He was first invited to the show in 2015 and appeared twice last year. \nHe previously co-hosted GMA reality show “Like” with Tom Rodriguez.
