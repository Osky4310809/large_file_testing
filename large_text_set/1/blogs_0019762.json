Photo by Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net \nSan Sebastian’s quest for an immaculate record is nearly finished as it dropped Lyceum, 25-21, 25-19, 25-17, in its penultimate game in the elimination round of the NCAA Season 92 women’s volleyball tournament Monday at San Juan Arena. \nGrethcel Soltones eased the Lady Stags’ into the victory when her final service was ruled an ace. \nIt’s now an 8-0 slate for the Lady Stags, a win away from completing the sweep, while the Lady Pirates walked off the Final Four picture as they slipped to a 5-4 record behind fifth seed Perpetual Help. ADVERTISEMENT \nLady Stags head coach Roger Gorayeb was pleased with how his offense got balanced out with Joyce Sta. Rita and Katherine Villegas complementing the scoring of Soltones. \n“Not all of the offense went through Grethcel, usually around 80 percent of our offense revolved around her now it’s around 65,” said Gorayeb. \nSta. Rita’s 13 points equaled Soltones’ output while Villegas added nine. \nHe added defense wasn’t his problem with diminutive libero Alyssa Eroa serving as their anchor. \n“I really don’t have much problems on defense because Eroa’s in there.” \nChristine Millares led the Lady Pirates with seven points while Cherilyn Sindayen and Czarina Orros had six apiece.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T14:03:15.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
