It was not a result we wanted before the game but at 3-0 down we’d have signed for 3-3. We were unlucky in some decisions.” Sanchez seemingly can't believe what he is seeing with time left to win the match \nSanchez, whose contract expires in 2018, has been offered a new deal worth £180,000-a-week to stay but has also had a interest from China worth more than double that amount. \nThe 28-year-old has stalled on signing and made it plain he wants success as well as improved terms, leaving some of his team-mates believing he does already have an offer from another club lined up. poll loading Will Alexis Sanchez sign a new deal at Arsenal? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:45:40.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
