Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible.\" \nBut no terror attack happened in Sweden on Friday night. \nIn fact, the only recent terror incident in Sweden led to the January arrest of three men who targeted a Gothernberg Asylum centre for a homemade bomb attack which seriously injured one man. \nThe three men were part of the neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement, which openly promotes racist, anti-immigration and anti-Semitic views. \nThe billionaire's baffling comments spawned the spoof hashtags #JeSuisIKEA and #IStandWithSweden while users checked on the safety of ABBA.

Terror attack? What has he been smoking?” \nLast night, Trump claimed his comments referred to a feature broadcast on Fox News on Friday night about Sweden, claiming the Swedish government was trying to cover up an increase in crimes, including rape, brought on by the country’s policy of welcoming refugees. \nThis is untrue. There is no evidence of an increase in crime in Sweden after the refugee crisis. The most recent Swedish crime survey found crime rates have changed little over the last 10 years. While there were 13% more reported rapes in 2016 than 2015, the total was still lower than 2014. In 2005, Sweden introduced a much more expansive definition of rape compared other western nations. Many crimes recorded as rape in Swedish law would be recorded as other crimes elsewhere.
