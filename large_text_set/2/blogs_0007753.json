We want to close the gender gap in national politics by increasing the number of women running at local and state-levels across the country. We’re going to do it by using data-driven organizing, teaming up with allied organizations, and building pipelines to ensure the success of our future progressive leaders. How We Started Nearly three months ago, we lost a big election. Since then, we’ve marched and resisted. We’ve gone back to the drawing board. We’ve brainstormed how to sustain the energy from the Women’s March and immigration rallies. We’ve circled around and around one clear reality: we need an infusion of diverse, creative and pragmatic people to run for all levels of office. We need women. The United States is 97th in the world for representation of women in national legislature — coming in behind nearly all developed nations. Unsurprisingly, the stats for women of color are even worse, chalking up to roughly 5% of all state legislators. We know that women make strong and capable lawmakers, who are historically apt at bipartisan coalition-building. But there’s a problem: women need to be recruited, and it isn’t happening. Nationally, only 26% of female state legislators report that they sought office of their own accord, compared to nearly half of their male counterparts. Women are half as likely to feel prepared, significantly more likely to be discouraged from running, and typically need to be asked multiple times before they say yes. The bottom line: there has to be a nationalized recruitment effort to get women into office, starting at the local and state levels. When we realized all of this, we put everything else on hold to work on it. Now, we need your help . What We Believe All politics is local. First Ask will support the progressive movement by bringing resources to the ground and working within communities to identify future leaders and representatives. Equality comes from equal representation. Supporting women is both ethical and pragmatic — women are both radically underrepresented and historically better at bipartisan coalition-building. In an era of intense polarization, we need people who will reach across the aisle and push the country forward. We’re stronger when we work together. So we will partner with allied organizations, challenge the status quo, resist complacency, and above all — push for change. Where We’re Heading In 2017, we’re focusing on a handful of competitive State House races in Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina. We’re developing data-driven candidate identification models that also rely on localized knowledge and community input. At the end of the day, we’re organizers. Our approach will be in-person and community specific. With that in mind (and in the image of North Carolina’s fantastic Lillian’s List) , we’re developing a national network of talent scouts to help us identify new progressive leaders across the country. These scouts will be everyone from grocery store cashiers to teachers to faith leaders. First Ask will train everyone wanting to help find new leaders who will drive change. In 2017, we’ll test our models, adjust them, and expand. We’ll also coordinate with training, fundraising, and management organizations that support progressive activists and candidates. We’ll build an infrastructure pipeline by keeping open channels of communication with those partners, and fostering smooth transitions between stages of leadership. In 2018 and beyond, we’ll expand on our 2017 models to include both State Senate and local races in key districts. We’ll work with groups like EMILY’s List, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, and Democratic Governor’s Association to identify states that will be most helpful to 2020 progressive redistricting goals. Who’s Helping Us Get There Partners . As of today, First Ask is officially allied with Deck Apps, Emerge America, and Code Blue. Our list of partners is growing rapidly, and we’re excited about it. Board of Advisors. We’re lucky to have an expanding group of people who have signed on to guide First Ask’s founding and first year. They include: Chris Wyant, Ohio State Director, Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign A’Shanti Gholar, Political Director of Emerge America Max Wood, Founder of Deck Apps Helen Milby, Founder and President of the NewDEAL How It’s Going to Happen Identify State House districts in Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina . Our data partner, Deck Apps, is working with us to gauge districts that are historically friendly to progressives — and ones that aren’t, but where there might be some wiggle room. Get to know those districts. We’ll reach out to the hundreds of volunteer leaders and community groups who poured themselves into Hillary’s 2016 campaign. We’ll develop and utilize our national scouting program. We’ll learn about the districts — and the kind of leaders they want and need — from the people who live in them. Identification of leaders and recruiters. We’ll work with county chairs, school boards, and mayor’s offices to develop basic issue and key constituency frameworks. Then, we’ll work with those groups, as well as our scouts, to look high and low for leaders — paying special attention to those who traditional talent recruitment efforts might miss. Finally, we’ll ask existing leaders to recruit new ones. We believe that the best messengers and recruiters will always come from the community itself. Connection of candidates to one another and the rest of the pipeline infrastructure. This final step correlates directly to our third project goal — partnership. We’ll connect our candidates with one another, so that they can share best practices and form community. And we’ll partner with groups working on both the candidacy of women and/or support of down-ballot candidates. The Nitty Gritty Legal status. We’re filed as 501(c)4, recruiting both community activists and candidates. Location. We’re incorporated and based in Washington, D.C.
