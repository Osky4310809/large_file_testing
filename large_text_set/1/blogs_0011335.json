Credit: SWNS/SWNS 13 January 2017 â€¢ 1:34pm \nF at squirrels have been attacking children for food after overindulging themselves over Christmas. \nThe greedy animals have seen their waists balloon due to a mild winter that has seen them feasting on an abundance of snacks and food left on the frost-free ground. \nBut their increased appetites has led to them nipping and attacking people visiting Tehidy Country Park in Cornwall in a bid to get hold of food they might be carrying. Squirrels have become overweight due to the warm winter.

I don't want other children to go down there and get bitten,\" she said. \n\"A girl I used to go to school with messaged me on Facebook and said they'd tried to bite her little girl as well.\" Finley, three, had his hand bitten by hungry squirrels at a country park. Credit: SWNS/SWNS \nW ildlife expert and TV presenter Iolo Williams admitted that squirrels do normally look bigger at this time of year - but the extra food that's been available this winter has made them unusually large. \nMr Williams said: \"Because of the mild wet weather there has been an abundance of food for squirrels. \n\"There has been no shortage of nuts, seeds and fungi for them to eat and store. \n\"With the extra layers of fat and thicker winter coat this can make them look much bigger.\" Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T15:46:40.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
