249-253) English Voice Image Gallery \nLevy McGarden (レビィ・マクガーデン Rebī Makugāden ) is a Mage of the Fairy Tail Guild. She is the leader of Shadow Gear . [1] She was a member of Magic Council 's Custody Enforcement Unit, but after the defeat of Avatar , left to rejoin Fairy Tail. Contents Appearance Levy's appearance \nLevy is a rather young, petite teenage girl of a slender build who stands at a rather below-average height for her age. Her shoulder-length blue hair, which has eyebrow-length bangs, is normally tied up with a colorful bandana around her head. While initially portrayed as having rather straight hair, her hair has slowly gained a more wavy, wild look, with more locks hanging down the sides of her face. Levy has a variety of outfits, but her most preferred type of attire appears to be dresses and tank tops, both of which reveal the guild mark on her left scapula. [4] When performing tasks such as researching, she wears a pair of Gale-Force Reading Glasses and tends to tie up her hair to keep it out of her face. Personality Levy shies away from the battle \nLevy has a cheerful and upbeat personality, and as such she is, rather easily, able to get along quite well with her guildmates. Her kind spirit is shown through her reluctance to get involved in the many brawls the guild has together, as she is too nice to fight \"just for fun.\" She is also a very forgiving person, as she reconciled with Gajeel Redfox for torturing her and her teammates before the start of the Fairy Tail-Phantom Lord war , and later allowed him to become her partner for the S-Class Promotion Trial (albeit Gajeel more or less declared himself her partner). [5] Levy's annoyance towards Gajeel \nLevy is characterized by her love for reading, which is how she and Lucy Heartfilia quickly became friends: through their mutual love of books. [6] Levy has also been the only person to read Lucy's novel with her consent, showing their level of trust in each other. At times, however, Levy can be rather competitive: before the start of the S-Class Promotion Trial, she rewrote Freed Justine 's runes seemingly for the whole boat, though she quickly revealed that she merely rewrote them for Gajeel and herself. [7] Levy is also one of the more mature members of the guild, as she was the first to abandon the S-Class Promotion Trial in favor of unifying the guild members, [8] whereas some did not want to stop the trial at all. History Young Levy in Fairy Tail \nAside from having been at the guild since at least the age of 11, not much is known about Levy's past, but it is known that her fellow Shadow Gear members, Jet and Droy , have both asked her out at some point. Both, however, were rejected by her in a matter of seconds. [9] [10] She was also present to welcome Mirajane , Elfman , and Lisanna into the guild, happily speaking with the latter two siblings. [10] [11] Synopsis Daybreak arc \nLevy ventures to the request board, intent on accepting the mission to retrieve the book Daybreak from Everlue 's mansion, though Mirajane tells her that Natsu and Lucy had already taken it, She is then further deterred by Makarov , who advises her not to bother with it as the quest is likely to become rather complicated. [12] Lullaby arc \nLevy and the rest of Shadow Gear can be seen amongst the crowd when Natsu and Erza are fighting each other; Levy agrees that Erza is the most powerful female Mage in Fairy Tail, though Jet points out that the strongest men in Fairy Tail are Laxus , Mystogan and Gildarts . Levy and Shadow Gear are then later shocked to witness a messenger from the Magic Council arrive, intent on arresting Erza. [13] Phantom Lord arc Levy, Jet and Droy after Gajeel's attack \nLevy, along with Jet and Droy, are attacked by Phantom Lord 's Gajeel Redfox, and after being badly beaten, are chained to a tree in a crucifixion-esque style; Levy is humiliatingly branded with the mark of Phantom Lord. After being found, the state of her and her teammates triggers the start of the Fairy Tail-Phantom Lord war. [14] During the events that transpire, Levy remains in the guild, recovering. [15] Later, after being fully healed, Levy celebrates their victory over Phantom Lord with the rest of her guildmates. [16] Battle of Fairy Tail arc Levy is saved from Laxus by Gajeel \nLevy is seen together with Jet and Droy swimming in the guild's new indoor swimming pool. [17] After Makarov introduces Gajeel as a new Fairy Tail member, Levy is seen saying to Lucy, despite her bodily tremors, that Gajeel's presence is not bothering her. [18] Levy then witnesses, and admires, Lucy's bravery at insulting Gajeel for his blatant rudeness. [19] As Jet and Droy venture out to pay Gajeel back for his harming of them during the Fairy Tail-Phantom Lord war, Levy tries to stop them. However, Laxus arrives and begins to attack them as well, after which Levy realizes that Gajeel wasn't fighting back on purpose, as he wants them to recognize him as their guildmate rather than an enemy. As Levy tries to stop Laxus, he attacks her with a bolt of lightning , though Gajeel intercepts the attack, much to her surprise. [20] She is next seen participating in the Miss Fairy Tail contest where she uses her Magic to make fancy texts appear in midair, impressing Jet and Droy. [21] After her turn ends, she, along with the other contestants, is turned into stone by Evergreen and is used as a hostage for Laxus' scheme. [22] Levy works hard to free Gajeel and Natsu \nWhen Erza defeats Evergreen, Levy and the other petrified girls are returned to their normal states. [23] While Makarov informs them of Laxus and the Thunder God Tribe 's actions, Laxus invokes his Thunder Palace , which leaves the entire town at his mercy. She then notices that Freed 's restrictions are a form of rune-based Magic and informs the others that she'll undo the restrictions so that Natsu and Gajeel can leave, as she believes them to be capable of defeating Laxus. [24] While working, Levy notices Gajeel staring at her and informs him that he must defeat Laxus. [25] \nAfter Lucy defeats Bickslow , Levy states that such a thing is to be expected, before resolving to do her best as well. She then manages to rewrite Freed's runes, allowing Natsu and Gajeel to finally exit the guild and fight. [26] Before they leave, she tells them to stay away from one another as Freed's enchantments are still active in the surrounding area and that if they were both caught in one, everything would be over. [27] Levy tries to stop Laxus \nWith ten minutes left until Thunder Palace rains down on Magnolia, Porlyusica arrives to help the extremely sickened Makarov. After Levy escorts Porlyusica to Makarov, she is told, after having the man examined, to bring Laxus to the guild, as Makarov may not have much time left. [28] Levy eventually makes her way to the Kardia Cathedral, where she finds Laxus preparing to cast Fairy Law ; she informs him that Makarov is dying and begs him to stop and visit him. Laxus, however, ignores her and casts Fairy Law, seeing his grandfather's state as a way for him to become Master. Laxus' attempt, however, fails, and Levy and the rest of Magnolia emerge unharmed. [29] \nAfter Laxus is defeated, Levy participates in the Fantasia Parade together with the other Miss Fairy Tail contestants. She is later seen raising her hand, along the rest of the guild, signaling to the departing Laxus that they will be always watching over him. [30] Daphne arc \nNote: Events in this arc occur only in the anime and do not constitute canon material . Click \"show\" to read the plot arc. Levy tells Wendy to come with Shadow Gear \nLevy sees Wendy at the request board and tries to convince her to go on her first mission with Shadow Gear , however, Lucy recommends that she go with Team Natsu instead. They never get an answer though, for as soon as Wendy hears the news that somebody has spotted a Dragon, she leaves the guild with Natsu. [31] Later, after Fairy Tail sends Macao , Elfman , and Wakaba to battle the new enemies , Levy watches them return; she then informs Mirajane about their conditions. [32] Levy helps Natsu with her fire \nAfter Gray comes back after talking with Makarov, he explains to everyone the truth behind his actions and how he just wanted Natsu to remember a promise he made with the people of the City Without Sound . Eventually, Natsu is somewhat able to communicate through the Dragonoid and everyone encourages him to fight against it by making him angry so as to force him to invoke his Flame of Emotion. Natsu is soon freed by the efforts of Gajeel, who later tells the guild to send as much fire towards Natsu as possible. Levy helps out in the task, and with this, Natsu is able to defeat Daphne, after which Levy then celebrates with the guild. [33] Edolas arc \nLevy happily welcomes back Lucy together with Jet and Droy [34] and she is later seen at Wendy and Carla 's welcoming party where she is shown visibly surprised when Gildarts says he failed to complete his 100-year quest. [35] [36] Levy is later sucked through the Anima , alongside the rest of the guild and the Magnolia, [37] and is turned into a giant Lacrima . [38] However, they are freed thanks to the efforts of Mystogan, who returns everyone back to Earth Land (excluding Gray, Natsu, Lucy, Wendy, Erza, Gajeel, Carla, and Happy), through the Reverse Anima Process. She, like her guildmates and the town's inhabitants, remains unaware of the happenings in Edolas . [39] Tenrou Island arc Levy blushes at Gajeel's offer of help \nWith the events revolving around Edolas over, Levy is named as a candidate for the S-Class Mage Promotion Trial, leaving her surprised, wondering if Makarov actually called her name; Jet and Droy are delighted to hear her nomination. [40] Jet and Droy then start arguing about who's going to be her partner whilst Levy begins to lose heart at the idea due to her lack of strength. Gajeel, however, comes up to her and states that if she wants to be an S-Class Mage, he'll be her trial partner. Though she still remains pessimistic about her chances of even lasting long, Gajeel gives her words of encouragement, saying that he'll make her bigger, causing her to blush. [5] \nAs the participants head towards Tenrou Island on a boat, Levy becomes dizzy due to the extreme heat. Shortly thereafter, Makarov appears and explains the rules of the first portion of the trial. When the first trial starts, Freed places a rune on the boat, preventing everyone from leaving for five minutes. However, Levy manages to rewrite the rune rather quickly, allowing only her and Gajeel to leave. Before jumping off the boat, Levy mockingly apologizes to Lucy. [41] Upon arriving, Levy and Gajeel pick the \"quiet\" path, granting them an easy road with no battles. [42] Levy saved by Gajeel \nIn the second part of the trial, Levy and Gajeel start a search for the First Guild Master 's grave. Along the way, Gajeel complains about how he didn't get to fight anyone, namely Natsu and Erza, prompting Levy to become angered at the fact that he doesn't \"look at [her];\" she then runs away. However, Levy is very quickly surrounded by two members of Grimoire Heart . Taken completely by surprise, Levy is almost instantaneously defeated. Before they can manage to kill her, however, Gajeel arrives and takes the attack, causing Levy to blush. [43] \nAfter Levy and Gajeel find out that their plan is to eradicate Fairy Tail, Yomazu uses Gō , which creates a painfully deafening sound. Kawazu then makes his move, though Levy pushes Gajeel out of the way so as to prevent him from taking damage. However, the Dark Mage then follows up by releasing his Egg Buster , cascading Gajeel and Levy with a superfluous amount of eggs. Levy then proceeds to use Solid Script: Silent to cancel out Yomazu's Gō and Solid Script: Fire to boil the eggs that Kawazu had produced, however Kawazu simply releases more eggs, breaking the fire apart. When Gajeel is hit by Narukami —which slices right through his body—Levy bursts into tears. When Gajeel tells her to escape and let everyone know what is happening on the island, Levy uses Solid Script: Iron to create iron for Gajeel. Telling him not to die, she then runs off. [44] Levy tells Erza about the situation \nAs she looks for the other members of Fairy Tail, she frantically ponders what could be the reason for Grimoire Heart's impending invasion of Tenrou Island before remembering that she must warn every Fairy Tail Mage present on the island before something catastrophic happens. Not watching where she was going, Levy accidentally trips and knocks herself out. When she comes to, she finds herself in front of Erza and Juvia, who ask her what happened. [45] Informing them of the perils to come, the three women run back towards the site of Gajeel's battle, where they find Gajeel falling to the ground, heavily wounded, in victory. Frantically running towards the Iron Dragon Slayer, Levy begs Gajeel to \"hang in there\" whilst leaning over his battered body, shaking in anxiety. [46] \nMoments later, as Erza begins to interrogate Yomazu, Levy announces that she'll take Gajeel to the camp. [47] She is later seen being surrounded with the Mages deployed by Grimoire Heart with a still-unconscious Gajeel hanging from her shoulder. [48] Levy is eventually able to escape and reaches the camp, crying over Gajeel and Mirajane's bodies. Levy cries for Fairy Tail to unite \nSuddenly, Elfman arrives at the camp carrying an unconscious Evergreen, where he unwillingly admits that the enemy is strong and that they just can't win. Although Levy is also troubled by this fact, she stands up and states the enemy is indeed strong, however, that simply means that Fairy Tail needs to unite to match their strength. She states that the exam made everyone go their separate ways, but the situation now calls for everyone to unite; she cries out for everyone to unite their feelings and fight back. [49] Levy and Lisanna vs. Rustyrose \nLevy is then seen watching over Gajeel, Mirajane, Elfman and Lisanna when Panther Lily arrives and tells her that Natsu and the others are on their way. Soon after, Rustyrose shows up and challenges her, Panther Lily and Lisanna to battle. [50] During the course of the battle, she notices Bluenote Stinger 's Magic. [51] Later, when Freed and Bickslow arrive, she is both shocked and happy to see them and marvels at the true power of the Thunder God Tribe. [52] Levy, along with Panther Lily and Lisanna, then proceeds to warn Freed and Bickslow to be careful when Rustyrose attacks them with his Ghosts of Brittia , [53] however, when Azuma uproots the Tenrou Tree, which gives protection and power to all those with the Mark of Fairy Tail, Levy and others collapse. [54] After Rustyrose is defeated, Natsu and the others arrive at the camp, where Panther Lily suggests splitting into two teams, to which Levy agrees; she wishes for them to divide into attack and defense teams. [55] When Natsu gets up to go battle Hades, Levy says she will stay with Bickslow and Freed and help with the defense. Before the attack group leaves, Levy wishes Lucy good luck. [56] \nNote: The following events occur only in the anime and do not constitute canon material. Click \"show\" to read the summary. Levy guards against Kain \nIn their guild's camp, while Lisanna treats Elfman's wounds, Freed and Levy set up their defensive runes; in response, Bickslow sends Rustyrose floating down the river, thinking that he may carry an Organic Link Magic that would lead the enemy towards their location. Suddenly, however, Bickslow is attacked from behind by a Kan spell. The attacker reveals himself to be Yomazu, accompanied by Kawazu, who then attacks the group with Heavy Egg Rain ; Levy manages to block the spell with Solid Script: Guard . Yomazu then uses his knowledge of runes to dispel the ones surrounding the camp just as Kain Hikaru arrives and attacks Elfman with Shining Dodoskoi . He then begins to battle Lisanna. [57] Levy ready to fight Kain \nKain is then attacked by Levy's Solid Script: Iron; Levy believes that she, Lisanna and Cana will be able to defeat the Dark Mage if they combine forces. Kain then begins to charge at them but Levy causes him to fall into a pitfall . The girls then launch a combination attack, however, they soon discover that Elfman was the one that was attacked. The group then sees Kain charging towards them, his body turned into mist, as he explains that he can change positions with Elfman, whose hair is still on Mr. Cursey . [57] Triple Unison Explosion \nHowever, as Kain approaches the group, he triggers a rune trap and becomes unable to use Magic; Levy reveals that a sneak attack was something that she and Freed took into account. She then uses Solid Script: Storm as Cana throws the Death and Fire cards. Lisanna, having gained wings with Animal Soul: Wings , catches the two attacks and combines them together, attacking Kain with Triple Unison Explosion , defeating the Dark Mage. [57] Lisanna, Levy and Cana stunned at Elfman \nWhile Freed and Bickslow are battling the Dark Mages , Levy, Lisanna and Cana are trying to free Elfman, who is half-buried in the ground. Once Elfman is freed, the three girls debate on whether to join in the fight, noting that they're out of Magic Power. Elfman then wakes up and eats Kawazu's Egg Wall before subsequently joining the fight. [58] Levy and the others come to help \nAfter the war with Grimoire Heart ends, Levy goes to rest at the camp. While there, Levy tells Wendy to take a rest because she has used too much Magic Power, to which she is met with the reply that she is fine. [59] However, the pleasantries end when Acnologia , the infamous Black Dragon, lands on Tenrou Island and starts rampaging, prompting the Fairy Tail members to begin running towards the ship. Makarov then enters Full- Giant mode and grabs Acnologia, holding it off from attacking the guild members. Levy and the others express their desire to help Makarov, but he shouts for them to not disobey his final order. [60] When Makarov is overwhelmed by Acnologia, all of them return and attack the Dragon, though Acnologia shrugs off the combined assault.

After said cheer, she converses with Wendy until Sabertooth 's Frosch strays away from Rogue and enters their vicinity. She witnesses as Gray cuddles the Exceed, and then joins her friends in giving the Exceed much attention. [178] \nRegrouping after defeating Avatar, Levy tells the group that she, Gajeel and Panther Lily will go to Magnolia when they are done there. [179] Later at Magnolia, Levy reunites with Jet and Droy and states she has left the Council, after which she smiles at seeing Lucy's tears of joy at seeing everyone in the guild come back together. [180] Alvarez Empire arc Levy finishing the guild's registration \nWith the other returned members of the old Fairy Tail vowing to recreate the guild, Levy sets about doing all of the formal paperwork required to get the guild legalized by the Magic Council . She is stumped with who to list as the guild master, as no one really seems to be able to handle the rambunctious group; however, after seeing Erza silence everyone with a single glare, Levy declares the armored Mage to be the seventh guild master. [181] \nLevy visits the Magic Council to give Fairy Tail's revival paperwork to Jura Neekis . The two make small talk before Warrod Sequen arrives, followed shortly by Wolfheim , his appearance greatly shocking Levy. Wolfheim loses his temper over Warrod's jokes and enters into a beastly state. At that moment, Hyberion enters, something which terrifies both Levy and Jura, and scolds Wolfheim and Warrod for fighting. Wolfheim returns to his normal form and Levy and the others listen as Hyberion tells them that they need to find a way to deal with the Alvarez Empire peacefully. When Levy mentions God Serena 's absence, the three Gods of Ishgar look forlorn and Hyberion tells her that God Serena abandoned them to join Alvarez, and is now a member of Emperor Spriggan 's protection squad: the Spriggan 12 ; this piece of information greatly astounding Levy. [182] Gajeel landing on Levy \nLater, Levy follows Gajeel and the rest of his B-Team, interrupting their conversation and stating that they need separate teams to raise their chance of success. She then angrily asks how they could leave her behind, and Gajeel goes on to mock her for her size. Setting aside the jokes, she tells the team that confronting the Alvarez Empire head-on is a mistake they can't afford to make. [183] After this, they all head to the Pegasus Village hot springs to relax. While there, they meet up with Ichiya , who tells them that Laxus and the Thunder God Tribe have joined Blue Pegasus , something which shocks Levy. When Gajeel is knocked over to the women's side of the hot springs and lands on top of Levy, she is visibly embarrassed and thus hits him. [184] Later, the team boards Ichiya's Christina to rescue Makarov; and after finding him along with Team Natsu and Mest Gryder , Levy takes to the loudspeaker to harken the group aboard. After they have all been successfully rescued, Levy happily watches alongside her comrades as Makarov bursts into tears over having such a great family in Fairy Tail. [185] At the guild following Makarov's return, Lucy comments that everyone is so noisy, but Levy says that at least everything is back to normal. [186] Levy notices Christina's arrival \nAfter Mavis finishes her story, Levy is shocked to learn that Fairy Heart is an infinite supply of Magic Power. The First Master then gets upset over dragging everyone into battle, but everyone agrees that it's not her fault. Afterwards, the topic of Zeref's immortality is brought up, [187] and Natsu mentions that his right arm is something that can do the job, but he refuses to tell what it is. Shortly after, when Makarov goes over all the information he gathered about the Alvarez Empire, Levy is distressed over the fact that the first Wizard Saint will be their opponent. [188] Some time later, the sounds of Alvarez mounting their attack awaken Levy from her sleep. [189] As the Spriggan invasion begins to overwhelm Fairy Tail's forces, Levy begins to sweat as she states they didn't expect them to corner them like this. [190] After hope seems lost, Max berates Warren about giving up, which causes Levy to gain a confident smile across her face. [191] Having regained their hope, the Mages of Fairy Tail manage to defeat Alvarez's invading forces; although victory is short-lived, as an enormous energy blast fired by the Shield of Spriggan, Wahl Icht, approaches the guild house at neck-breaking speed, leaving Levy and the others at a loss of what to do to protect themselves. However, as all hope seems lost, Levy hears a voice in the distance, recognizing the speaker, as Ichiya arrives aboard Christina, rescuing the guild by using the Magic Bomber as a shield. [192] Levy comforted by Gajeel's words \nA day after Alvarez's initial assault, Levy is assigned by Mavis to meet up with Sabertooth and Blue Pegasus in the north and smirks lightly with confidence. [193] After Mavis readjusts the plan after Natsu took off on his own, Levy listens on intently. [194] The night before the battle is to begin, Levy sees Gajeel sitting out late at night and asks if he is going to rest up, to which he responds she is one to talk. Levy states that she is scared as the enemy is the most powerful they have ever faced and her Magic just doesn't compare. Suddenly, Gajeel surrounds her in iron clubs, stating he is going to arrest her for complaining. She pouts slightly before he says he is going to arrest her and lock her up in the guild's prisons, causing her to then smile. [195] Arriving at the northern front, Levy says she hopes the members of Saber and Blue Pegasus are safe. As they spot the enemy forces though, they prepare for battle, but are caught off guard when the defeated members of Sabertooth and Blue Pegasus are paraded before them on crosses. [196] They then rush at the battlefield, managing to rescue the Mages of Sabertooth and Blue Pegasus. [197] The group prepare for a great battle ahead of them, with Levy doubting the power her abilities to achieve much success in the situation. [198] Levy saves Gajeel from Bloodman \nGajeel very quickly begins a battle against Bloodman , where Levy looks on in worry when Gajeel announces his readiness to die in the upcoming fight. [199] Then, when Gajeel is about to be killed by Bloodman, Levy vaporizes Bloodman's vortex of skulls with her Solid Script: Shine ; when Gajeel expresses worry about her being near Bloodman's Magical Barrier Particles , Levy reveals that she has a mask protecting her. She immediately proceeds to rebuke Gajeel for his comments about dying, proclaiming that she wants him to keep on living. [200] Levy then reassures Gajeel as to the integrity of her mask, but Bloodman releases his full power and reveals that he manipulates Curse Power, and by extension the Curses of Tartaros , of which he uses against them, including Torafuzar's Tenchi Kaimei, which Levy manages to disperse. She and Gajeel are then hit by Bloodman's Over Skelter ; she is saved from the torrent of skulls by Gajeel, but her mask comes off, leading Levy to reveal to Gajeel that the mask never had any effect to begin with an that she absorbed Magical Barrier Particles via her skin. She is immediately yelled at by Gajeel, who asks her why she came to the battle, and she responds by saying that it was to save him, before collapsing. She then watches as Gajeel struggles and then eventually defeats Bloodman by devouring the poisonous Magical Barrier Particles and entering Dragon Force , after which she smiles at him. Her happiness, however, is turned to immediate worry when a dying Bloodman turns his body into a vortex and tries to assimilate Gajeel. [201] Levy breaks down after losing Gajeel \nLevy gets up and tries to help him, but is warned repeatedly by Gajeel that if she touches him, she'll turn into Magical Barrier Particles as well, but she replies that she doesn't care, and that she wants him to go back to the guild with her at any cost. Her advance is halted by Gajeel, who creates iron shackles for her, but she easily breaks free and continues to go forward until Panther Lily arrives and grabs her. She immediately screams for him to let her go, as Gajeel is going to die very shortly; Gajeel, as he fades, pours his heart out to Levy, telling her that she taught him how to love and that he wanted to walk alongside her forever, but she refuses to accept that he is disappearing. When he does, Levy breaks down and screams Gajeel's name. [202] Levy reminding Gajeel of his promise \nSome time later, Levy is caught in the light of Irene Belserion 's Universe One , [203] and warped somewhere alongside Lily. In her new location, she hears the voice of Zera telepathically telling her and other Fairy Tail members to head towards the guild and protect Mavis. [204] Alongside the voice of Zera, Levy hears Gajeel's voice as well, his being alive bringing her to tears. [205] And some time later, the two finally reunite, with Levy reminding Gajeel of his promise to return her to the guild, initially angry, but coming to tears promptly after. Right thereafter, alongside few of her other comrades, Levy bears witness to Zera's ethereal essence explain that she will disappear once Mavis remembers her. [206] As she predicted, Zera soon disappears, with Levy and her group expressing gratitude for her help. [207] \nAs the battle continues to rage on, Levy hears Mavis' voice project itself from the sky in reply to Irene Belserion having done so just prior, with both her and Gajeel confused as to where it is coming from. [208] Though the battle continues, Levy and the others are caught in the light of Makarov's final Fairy Law , which leaves them confused following its subsiding.
