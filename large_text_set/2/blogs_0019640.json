Under this offer, Jio customers get unlimited 4G data — FUP of 1GB per day — unlimited free voice and video calls, 100 SMSes per day, access to Jio’s premium suite of apps including JioTV, JioCinema and JioMusic, among others. However, the Happy New Year Offer is set to get over on March 31st, 2017. This is where the Prime membership comes into the picture. Prime users will be able to extend the benefits of the Happy New Year Offer for another year, that is, till March 31st, 2018. The benefits of the Prime membership will remain exactly the same as the Happy New Offer. In addition, the company says there will be many other attractive deals and offers from both Jio and its partners, that the Jio Prime members will enjoy. However, the details of such offers are still unknown. Who is eligible for the membership? \nAll existing users of Reliance Jio are eligible for the membership program. Moreover, any new customer who joins Jio’s service on or before March 31st 2017 can avail the benefits of the program once they are signed up for the same. How much does the Prime membership cost? \nEligible users can enrol for the Prime membership program with a one-time enrolment fee of Rs 99. After this, the customer needs to pay Rs 303 per month from April 2017 in order to avail the benefits of the program. The effective cost for the plan translates to roughly Rs 10 per day, wherein you’d be able to enjoy unlimited benefits that were available in the Happy New Year Offer. How to sign up? Interested users must enrol in the program to avail the benefits. The enrolment window will be opened from March 1st, 2017 to March 31st, 2017, during which eligible customers can pay the one-time enrolment fee of Rs 99 to enter the program. Enrolment can be done using the MyJio app, through Jio’s website, or through any Jio or Jio partner store. Is it mandatory to sign up for the Prime membership? \nAbsolutely not. The Prime membership is an optional offer for existing users and those who join before March 31st, 2017. In case one doesn’t want to sign up for the Prime membership, he / she can opt for any regular Jio tariff plans which would also be available from April 1st, 2017.
