Mark Dayton on Friday made his first public appearance since his prostatectomy last week, signing legislation that will provide aid to the town of Madelia after a devastating fire last year and also fund wetlands replacement. Dayton has been recovering at his Summit Avenue residence from his March 2 prostate surgery. He's had one follow-up visit at Mayo Clinic since then and said he would travel to Rochester again Friday for another visit. \"I feel pretty good,\" Dayton said, adding that he is not taking any pain medication aside from Tylenol. \"I feel clear-headed and up to speed\" Dayton, 70, also reported a clean pathology report. Dayton said he plans to keep up his normal schedule. The governor said he would release his supplemental budget proposal next week. It will contain revised figures following the release of the state budget and economic forecast last month, which saw the projected budget surplus grow from $1.4 billion to $1.65 billion.
