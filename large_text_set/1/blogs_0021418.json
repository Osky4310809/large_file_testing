Please make sure you check before travelling.’\nNetwork Rail said the derailment happened shortly before 6am and that it had a team of engineers at the site by 6.15am.\nThere were no passengers aboard and no-one was injured in the incident.\nA Network Rail spokesman said: ‘Owing to a freight train derailment between Lewisham and Hither Green services are severely disrupted into and out of Charing Cross and Cannon Street.\n‘Passengers are advised to check their journey before they travel.’\nSoutheastern passengers vented their frustration on Twitter.\nOne user, Nicky W, said: ‘Another day another #southeastern disaster.

Because a freight train derailment at Lewisham that’s not even on that line?!’, while Emilie Murphy added: ‘Derailed freight train at Lewisham means Uber to Kings Cross. Think I’ll still miss my train – @virgineastcoast will you honour tickets?’\nThe derailment means trains cannot run between Dartford and Lewisham via Sidcup, with a shuttle service being arranged between Sidcup and Dartford.\nTrains are not running from Hastings towards London, while those from Ramsgate that normally run to Charing Cross are being diverted to London Victoria.\nServices starting and terminating at both Tunbridge Wells and Sevenoaks are also suspended, Southeastern said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T10:09:38.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
