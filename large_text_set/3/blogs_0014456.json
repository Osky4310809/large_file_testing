Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mum who went into labour on her wedding night and lost her baby has spoken of her tragedy for the first time. \nVictoria Holland had been excitedly planning for the arrival of her little boy when she started to feel achy and tired before her wedding day. \nAt 27 weeks pregnant she just put it down to being so busy. \nThe wedding, at Dudley Register Office, went beautifully but later that evening Victoria’s pains became significantly worse so she went to hospital to get checked out. \nWithin five minutes of arriving, she’d gone into labour.
