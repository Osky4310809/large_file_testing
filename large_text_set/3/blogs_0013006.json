A company partly owned by the Dallas Cowboys quarterback is trying yet again to hold a fan-centric fantasy football event that would feature Romo, Jason Witten and other NFL players. \nThe National Fantasy Football Convention was cancelled each of the past two summers due to the NFL taking legal action. Romo’s company – Fan Expo LLC – alleged that the NFL threatened players with suspensions if they attended the 2015 event in Southern California and claimed the league was interfering with sponsors last year. The company sued the NFL in 2015 for $1 million in damages, but the judge ruled in favor of the league. \n“Our main goal has always been to give the fans a chance to interact with the players during a truly unforgettable experience,” event CEO Andy Alberth said in a statement, via NBC 5 in Dallas . “And after three years of hard work, we’re unbelievably excited to see it all come together this summer in Dallas.” \nThis year’s event is scheduled for July 14-16 in Dallas, but Romo isn’t expected to be with the team by that time. The Cowboys reportedly have been shopping the 36-year old this offseason and are likely to release him if they can’t find a suitable trade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T04:15:43.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
