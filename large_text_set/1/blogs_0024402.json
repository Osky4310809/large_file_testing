He is mentally very strong, a winner who is never depressed. He thinks positively and has confidence in what he does. \" \nAncelotti has used Muller in a number of roles, including as a wide forward, and the Italian said the Germany international's versatility is key. \n“We expect a striker to have the best athletics, technique and creativity,” he said. \n“These are not the strengths of him, but he is tactically excellent, can play any position. \n“The press says, 'He is not a striker!' Really? I'm not an idiot! I know he is not a storm type like Robben or Costa. And I will not ask him to imitate them either. \" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T12:17:28.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
