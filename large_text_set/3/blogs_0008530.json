We would be jealous, but we’re too busy swooning over how incredible Emma Roberts’ new “Smoky Quartz” hair looks! Her hairstylist, Nikki Lee of Nine Zero One Salon, transformed her from her lovely reddish strawberry blonde to an absolutely incredible multi-faceted shade of brown that we have a feeling is gonna be all the rage this spring.\nWhat would be your go-to look if you could change your hair constantly? Would you take advantage and mix it up every time ? Go wild with every color of the rainbow? Or get some super high-maintenance highlights that would ordinarily be too expensive to maintain? We’d definitely try out Emma’s new look at some point!\nOn to the next role @emmaroberts #smokyquartz #NineZeroOne #901Girl \nA post shared by Nikki Lee | Hairstylist (@nikkilee901) on Mar 9, 2017 at 11:02pm PST \nHow pretty is that shade? It’s so much more than an ordinary brown, even though at first glance it looks relatively simple. The shade is rich, vibrant, and has a subtle glimmer. And yet it looks totally natural! That’s the work of a truly talented stylist!\nEmma posted the same snap on her Instagram , saying the look was for her next film role. Could this be for the upcoming psychological thriller Spinning Man , or the ensemble drama Four Seasons ?\nHere’s a look at the last shade that Nikki worked her magic on, “Cayenne Spice.”\nBecause last Sunday #CayenneSpice was on another level! @emmaroberts #VanityFair #901Girl \nA post shared by Nikki Lee | Hairstylist (@nikkilee901) on Mar 5, 2017 at 10:17am PST \nGirl is serving us some Veronica Lake realness and we are LIVING for it. Nikkie was also responsible for Emma’s gorgeous Oscars look.\n☁️Stairway to Heaven☁️#VintageDream @emmaroberts thank you for allowing me to be a part of this magical day!✨What an honor to work along side @ctilburymakeup @jennahipp and of course @elkin Love you girls!

We know what picture we’ll be taking to our stylist next time we hit the salon!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T20:04:51.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
