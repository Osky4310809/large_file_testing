Now some businesses are bringing back walls and doors. By Bryan Borzykowski 11 January 2017 \nFour years ago, Chris Nagele did what many other technology executives have done before — he moved his team into an open concept office. \nHis staff had been exclusively working from home, but he wanted everyone to be together, to bond and collaborate more easily. It quickly became clear, though, that Nagele had made a huge mistake. Everyone was distracted, productivity suffered and the nine employees were unhappy, not to mention Nagele himself.

Share your stories with us on Facebook. \nIn April 2015, about three years after moving into the open office, Nagele moved the company into a 10,000-square foot office where everyone now has their own space — complete with closing doors. \nWe’re 15% less productive, we have immense trouble concentrating and we’re twice as likely to get sick in open working spaces \nNumerous companies have embraced the open office — about 70% of US offices are open concept — and by most accounts, very few have moved back into traditional spaces with offices and doors. But research that we’re 15% less productive, we have immense trouble concentrating and we’re twice as likely to get sick in open working spaces, has contributed to a growing backlash against open offices .

The truth is, we can’t multitask and small distractions can cause us to lose focus for upwards of 20 minutes. \nWhat’s more, certain open spaces can negatively impact our memory. This is especially true for hotdesking, an extreme version of open plan working where people sit wherever they want in the work place, moving their equipment around with them.

It’s not so obvious to us each day, but we offload memories — often little details — into our surroundings, she says. \nWe retain more information when we sit in one spot \nThese details — which could be anything from a quick idea we wanted to share to a colour change on a brochure we’re working on — can only be recalled in that setting. \nWe don’t collaborate like we think \nFor many of us, it’s the noise that disturbs us the most. Professors at the University of Sydney found that nearly 50% of people with a completely open office floorplan, and nearly 60% of people in cubicles with low walls, are dissatisfied with their sound privacy. Only 16% of people in private offices said the same.

However, it’s well documented that we rarely brainstorm brilliant ideas when we’re just shooting the breeze in a crowd. Instead, as many of us know, we’re more likely to hear about the Christmas gift a colleague is buying for a family member, or problems with your deskmate’s spouse.

Think about it: if you work in an open office, you’ll book a meeting room to brainstorm. It’s still an act that requires some level of planning and privacy. \nAnd it turns out our best work is done when we have total focus, says Augustin. We can work in a busy space, but the final product won’t be as good as if we are in a quiet locale. \nIt’s a shame to waste people by not giving them a place that supports what they actually do \n“[It’s] inefficient,” she says. “It’s a shame to waste people by not giving them a place that supports what they actually do.” \nOf course, she says, it’s important for us to bond and to get to know each other. But there are plenty of ways to bond in closed offices. Nagele’s team, for instance, eats lunch together every day. A few ideas come out of lunch time chats, he says, but most are developed from more focused brainstorming sessions. \nFinding the right balance \nFor jobs that require focus, like writing, advertising, financial planning and computer programming, some companies that aren’t ready to ditch open plans are experimenting with quiet rooms and closed spaces. \nSome of us even feel that escaping to a quiet room is a sign of weakness \nThe trouble with that, is some of us don’t feel comfortable leaving the team to go off on our own—it can feel as if we’re not pulling our weight if we’re not present. That’s particularly true in high-pressure environments. Some of us even feel that escaping to a quiet room is a sign of weakness, Augustin says. \nOther companies are creating closed spaces for smaller teams. Ryan Mullenix, a partner with NBBJ, a global architecture firm ,has worked with tech firms that have built offices for between three and 16 people. View image of (Credit: Getty Images) \nThey can still collaborate, but they can also block out noise from other teams of people they don’t need to hear from. Technology can also help. Mullenix’s own office has sensors, placed 10 feet apart, that can track noise, temperature and population levels. Staff can log on to an app and can find the quietest spot in the room. \nPeople can now do focused work and they have more time to work Against the grain \nSome of us thrive in open offices. Those who do repetitive tasks represent one group. Another: more junior employees. For them, it’s easier to learn by watching how others work. If new-to-work staff get their own office from the start, they may lose focus and perform at a lower level, Augustin says. \nThe bad news for unhappy open-office dwellers: the concept isn’t going away any time soon. But, says Nagele, more companies should consider what he’s found. His employees are happier and more productive—and that helps not just the company, but the team. \n“People can now do focused work and they have more time to work,” he says. “That’s helped everyone’s mindset.” \nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter .
