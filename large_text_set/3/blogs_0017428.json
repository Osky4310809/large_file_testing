As such, it’s no wonder that the culinary component of the country’s biggest music festival has become more important every year. After selling out passes to the annual event, Coachella has finally unveiled its chef lineup for this year’s seated Outstanding in the Field spanning both weekends, and released more GA and VIP festival tickets in conjunction with the dinners. \nBasically it’s the only way to gain entry into the festival if you don’t already have tickets: buy a not-inexpensive dinner and tack on the general admission or VIP tickets. It’s probably easier than trying to get them after market.\nThis year, the four-course, family-style meal characterized by its snaking communal tables moves from the VIP Rose Garden to the shaded Hacienda Del Toro, with offerings from some of the best chefs in the country. Local headliners include Eggslut’s Alvin Cailan, Badmaash’s Nakul and Arjun Mahendro, Ricebar’s Charles Olalia, Union’s Bruce Kalman, and former Leona chef Nyesha Arrington.\nBeyond LA, Outstanding in the Field diners can sample dishes by Paul Kahan (avec, Blackbird, The Publican), Donnie Masterton (The Restaurant), Jamie Bissonette (Toro, Coppa), Ken Oringer (Toro, Coppa), and Jamie DeRosa (Tongue & Cheek, Izzy’s Fish and Oyster).\nThe dinner includes a welcome cocktail and beer and wine, and is priced at $225. Those without festival passes will have to add on GA admission for $399 or VIP for $899.
