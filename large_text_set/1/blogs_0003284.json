Sam Gradwell (fourth from left) and James Drake (ninth from left) at the WWE United Kingdom Championship press conference (Photo: Rex Features) \nYou are both stalwarts of the UK wrestling scene, the North West in particular, and both from Blackpool. What does it mean for WWE to be bringing this tournament to your hometown and better yet, for you to be taking part in it? \nGradwell: For this to be in our hometown is absolutely incredible. It's a dream come true. It's quite poetic really. I've wrestled in China, Hong Kong, Spain, Holland, the Isle of Man and up and down England, but it's always been my goal to wrestle for WWE, since I was about five-years-old. So for it to come full circle and for me to make my debut for them in my hometown, it's absolutely incredible.\" \nDrake: I'm very similar to Sam in that wrestling is my life and always has been my life. Growing up in Blackpool, the amount of times I've walked past the Empress Ballroom... not once did it occur to me that I would be making my WWE debut there! It's mental. I still don't believe it now. I've wrestled all over the UK in just under 600 matches to date and I've wrestled people from Mexico, Sweden, Finland, Italy, Germany, China and Japan. I've really got to get stuck in with a lot of different styles and a lot of different talents from around the world. At the age of 23 now I'm quite rich in experience and to get this opportunity at such a young age is an honour. It really is an honour. Sam and I really have grown up together in this business. The chance that we could face each other in our hometown, live on the WWE Network, in front of a sold-out audience and millions of people watching at home, it's baffling, it really is! WWE United Kingdom Championship star Sam Gradwell (Photo: © WWE) \nWere either of you lucky enough to see the acclaimed NXT show held at the venue in December 2015? \nGradwell: Yes, I was in attendance for that. I said then and there, that was the most mind-blowing, special atmosphere of any show I had ever been at. I remember being sat in that audience at NXT, looking around and making a little note to myself, I want to wrestle here, I want to be a part of this. Funnily enough I didn't know until Triple H said at the press conference that it was going to be in Blackpool, so being stood on that stage and learning I was going to be making my WWE debut in my hometown, that was pretty sweet! \nWhat was it like being stood on that stage at the 02 Arena in London with 16 of your peers, plus Triple H, Finn Balor, William Regal, Nigel McGuinness and co? \nGradwell: Those 16 people are very special. It was just surreal, it was one of those pinch yourself moments. Me and James have wrestled each other countless times up and down the UK, we've come up together. Pete Dunne, I've travelled to China with him, I know T-Bone very well. I had some very close friends on that stage and people I watch and admire and learn from on a regular basis. There are people on there who I have trained with, people who I have heard a lot about but haven't had the chance to see, and then you had childhood heroes on there, Triple H and William Regal. \nThat's what's special about those 16 people - they haven't just picked 16 people getting the most hype online and people haven't fallen into that tournament by accident. Every single one of us has been meticulously selected and scouted by William Regal and Triple H. There wasn't a single person on that stage who didn't deserve to be there. It made it all the sweeter stood there knowing that. To have Triple H there, William Regal, Finn Balor, who I respect and admire so much, was great. Also the reception we got from the press - I would be as bold to say the biggest reaction was when the 16 competitors walked out. The new WWE United Kingdom Championship (Photo: © WWE) \nDefinitely. I looked to see who I knew and immediately recognised both of you and T-Bone, who I have seen live countless times at shows across the North West. Having watched you compete in social clubs and sports halls, it was a very cool moment to see you take to this global stage. \nGradwell: Thank you very much for saying so. \nDrake: Thank you. When I was on that stage at that moment, when we got that round of applause, it felt right and I felt like I deserved that spot. We have performed at working men's clubs to Butlin's and Haven Holiday parks, you name it, we've been there. We've put the work in to get where we are and like Sam said every person has been selected by Mr Regal, by Triple H, it isn't just 16 random people. So when we got that round of applause, I felt that sense of accomplishment. It was a complete circle if you will. WWE United Kingdom Championship star James Drake (Photo: © WWE) \nFor those who aren't familiar with your work, how would you each describe your style to people who haven't see you in the ring before? \nDrake: I would never label myself as a high flyer or a technical wrestler or whatever. If you watch me, you're watching James Drake. You're watching the wrestler James Drake, not a high flying wrestler or a technical wrestler, you're watching James Drake. My individuality makes me stand out. When my match is on, people are watching. People aren't on their phones, there's no mumbling! People are invested emotionally. That's one thing I do take a lot of pride in. It's intense and it's as real as it gets. So as far as my style goes, it's James Drake. That's the style. \nGradwell: As I said earlier, I've wrestled all over the world, and I try and take a little bit from everywhere I've been. I try and learn something from everybody I wrestle and everybody I train with. My style is a real hybrid. I've been trained quite extensively by [British wrestling legends] Marty Jones and Johnny Saint, so there is a little bit of British technical wrestling in there. I can brawl, I can fly and when I'm in the ring, that guy sitting on the front row laughing and calling us fake, when I reach back and slam my forearm into your face, that guy sits up and that guy starts taking notice. That's the guy whose attention I like to get. There's four ways to win a match, knockout, pinfall, submission or count-out and I will take any one of them to get a victory.
