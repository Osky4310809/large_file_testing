Of course we have to improve the squad, that is clear.\" \nLiverpool were left weakened in the winter due to injuries and the loss of star forward Sadio Mane to the African Nations Cup. And Klopp is eyeing a heavy haul of reinforcements to replenish the team. Jurgen Klopp is ready to spend on reinforcements this summer. \n\"We could have done with one or two players in January, when we had injury problems and the Africa Cup, but the transfer window didn't give us any opportunity,\" Klopp said. \"We will be prepared for the summer window, for sure. We are working on it already -- we might need between two and six players.\" \nLiverpool broke even with their transfer spend last summer. Klopp says that they may not repeat the feat for a second straight year. \n\"We need to make the right transfers,\" Klopp said. \"It is not about money -- we can go for the players we want -- but at the very top level you might be competing with Barcelona or someone. Some players would rather live in London or Manchester instead of Liverpool, so we have to make a decision and try and make it happen. \n\"It might not be possible to break even again; that just happened last season, it was not a target. There will be a few new faces in summer, that is how it is always.\" \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:12:19.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
