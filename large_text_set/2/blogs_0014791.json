He had a great game and I'm not just looking at his two assists for the goals. He worked well from the start. \nIsco stars in Madrid victory \n\"It was difficult to get both goals. We attacked for the whole game but we didn't get the second goal to give us some breathing space [until late on]. \n\"We were patient in the game and that is what is important. I like to mix patience with a touch of speed.\" 2 - Isco Alarcón has assisted twice in a same game for Real Madrid for the first time this season (all competitions).
