The Associated Press \nDonald Trump wishes he could tell President Barack Obama \"You're fired,\" just like he gets to do on his reality series \"The Apprentice.\" \nThe Donald took to Twitter to complain after Obama won the 2012 presidential election, calling it \"a total sham and a travesty.\" In a series of angry tweets, he even advocated \"revolution,\" though posts using that word have since been removed. \"We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty,\" Trump wrote. \"Our nation is totally divided! Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! ... The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more years...stay strong and never give up! House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.\" \nTrump, who toyed with the idea of running for president himself, endorsed Republican candidate Mitt Romney earlier this year and repeatedly asked for Obama's birth certificate. The real estate mogul and reality star even tried to throw an \" October surprise \" into the race last month when he offered to donate $5 million to charity in exchange for Obama's college and passport records. \nDallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban responded by offering to pay $1 million to Hurricane Sandy relief efforts if Trump would shave his head, prompting a Twitter feud between the two billionaires. \nAfter his political social media rant Tuesday night, NBC News anchor Brian Williams slammed Trump -- whose \" Celebrity Apprentice \" returns to NBC in March -- for his \"irresponsible\" reaction to the election results. \"Donald Trump, who has driven well past the last exit to relevance and veered into something closer to irresponsible here, is tweeting tonight,\" Williams said on the air before reading some of The Donald's tweets. \"So there, you have that. That happened.\" \nCelebrities also responded to Trump online, including \"30 Rock\" star Alec Baldwin , who wrote: \"@realdonaldtrump. You trust the voters when they choose The Apprentice. But not now?\" \nHere's a sample of Trump's Twitter postings Tuesday night: \nWe can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012 \nAt the time of Trump's initial tweets, Romney had a narrow lead over Obama in the popular vote with some poll results still not in. By Wednesday morning, the GOP candidate had lost in both the popular vote and the Electoral College. \nTrump's comments on the House of Representatives were made after the Republican party renewed control of the House for 2 more years, while Democrats maintained a majority in the U.S. Senate .
