Photographer: Edwin Tuyay Photographer: Edwin Tuyay/Bloomberg Analyst Dan Fineman wrote:\nBased on public statements from the president and other officials, it appears that the government has four objectives of relevance to investors. First and foremost, Duterte wants to move to a federal system with devolvement of power to local governments. Other less emphatic statements indicate that he also hopes to change from a presidential to a parliamentary system. Of interest to investors, he has spoken of lowering foreign ownership limits. Lastly, Duterte has spoken of allowing the president to declare martial law without interference from Congress or the Supreme Court.\nThe rewriting process will be extended. First, the president will likely soon appoint a committee of experts to offer recommendations after six months. At some point, Congress and the government would need to decide whether Congress or a specially elected assembly will conduct the rewrite. If they decide on the former, the Supreme Court then needs to determine if the two houses of Congress sit jointly or together. After that, Congress would vote on a draft, and finally a referendum would be required. We do not expect completion until well into 2018 at the earliest.\nDistraction from infrastructure execution and tax reform is the biggest risk. Constitutional reform seems to be the president’s first or second priority along with the war on drugs, and it is possible that he and his legislative team will devote more attention to the rewrite than the tax bills. We see the risk as highest if Congress conducts the rewrite itself, as the process would require extensive time from legislators.\nHaving fallen only 1.6% in 2016, the PSE Index now trades at 19.5 times earnings. “Valuations, weak earnings growth and US rates remain our main concerns, but the constitutional rewrite poses a moderate mediumterm risk to the tax reform effort and a significant long-term risk to governance that we consider under-appreciated,” concludes Credit Suisse.\nIn 2016, the iShares MSCI Philippines ETF (EPHE) fell 3.2%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T08:27:54.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
