Henson came through with her SAG Awards look. \nLike, she really, REALLY came through, y’all. \nThe 46-year-old actress, known for her role as Cookie Lyon on the Fox drama “Empire,” was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in “Hidden Figures.” \nShe portrays the true story of Katherine Goble, a mathematician who calculated flight trajectories for Project Mercury and other missions at NASA while the organization was segregated. 20th Century Fox \nWhile I love her costume in the film, it’s a very different look than the look she had going on at the 2017 Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night. \nI’m talking about sheer, see-through material that makes her look like a sexy princess. I’m talking about a badass undercut that makes her look like she can, and will, beat up anyone in her path. \nTaraji brought all this and more, and I am very here for it. Like, look at this. Look at those perfect curves. Look at that perfect face. REX/Shutterstock This is ridiculous. How is she making ARMS so sexy right now?! REX/Shutterstock And don’t even get me started on that undercut. That undercut is healing my soul and body right now. REX/Shutterstock \nThat undercut is my new religion. I know I would never look this good in an undercut but like… should I get an undercut?! Look at the way she holds her dress when she walks! She is a literal princess! No, I will not stop shouting about it! REX/Shutterstock And by the way, her castmates Janelle Monáe and Octavia Spencer were looking pretty fine themselves. REX/Shutterstock \nCan I apply to be in this girl squad? References are available upon request and I’m happy to come in for an interview. \n(JK, I don’t belong in this girl squad. This girl squad is about black lady excellence. I don’t belong here. I’ll settle for Taylor Swift’s dumb white girl squad, I guess.) \nEven if Taraji doesn’t win her SAG tonight, she won the SAG of my heart. Which is meaningless to her, probably, but still. \nThank you Taraji, for bringing a little bit of light to a very bleak weekend. \n  Anna Menta Editor Anna Menta is a Entertainment Writer at Elite Daily.
