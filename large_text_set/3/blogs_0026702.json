Starting in April, travelers will get a pre-arrival Milk Bar cookie in a custom gift box. They’ll also get a Milk Bar green juice, and on redeye flights, they’ll get “bagel bombs” in Milk Bar-branded to-go bags, according to a press release .\nPastry chef and MasterChef judge Christina Tosi founded Milk Bar in 2008. She partnered with celebrity chef and restaurateur David Chang of the Momofuku restaurant group to develop both sweet and savory foods, including crack pie, cereal milk soft serve, and compost cookies.\n\"I spend a lot of time on airplanes lately,\" Tosi said in a statement. \"My secret travel trick when traveling to our Milk Bar stores and kitchens in NYC, DC, Las Vegas and beyond is to sneak a Milk Bar cookie on board to help me power through the flight. That’s why I was beyond pumped when JetBlue approached us with the opportunity to make their Mint experience a little sweeter.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:02:31.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
