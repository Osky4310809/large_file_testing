Will you love me? Who will love me?” he is heard yelling out in a sing-song voice in a nighttime video recorded by a resident.\nIn one recent performance witnessed by The Post, the trashy troubadour got even more intimate, if not downright gross, belting out in broad daylight, “I have a tiny d- -k!” in between slugs from a 22-ounce can of Coors stashed in a brown paper bag.\nThe NYPD identified the crooner as Damond Hood, 41, and said he had been busted 15 times since 1999, most recently in February for trespassing inside a nearby 7-Eleven store. He was also hauled off to the hospital for acting out on March 1 and March 8, cops said.\nResidents say Hood’s foulmouthed repertoire keeps them from getting any shut-eye and has left them at their wits’ end.\nOne young mother said she and her hubby even broke the lease on their third-floor apartment — where “we literally look at him all day” — to flee to Long Island with their little boy.\n“We both work here in the city, and our plan was to stay here for at least two years. [Hood] wakes our son up. He’s 11 months old. We are all suffering,” she fumed.\n“We work hard, and when we come home we want to enjoy our evenings and our weekends and we can’t, so we’re moving.”\nHood sits in the courtyard of 330 East 75th Street and sings all night. James Messerschmidt Another mom, who lives on the sixth floor, said: “I have a baby, and there’s been so many occasions where he’s woken up at 4 or 5 in the morning from this guy singing.\n“My husband and I have called the police several times, and they do nothing,” she added.\nThe baritone bum also routinely relieves himself in a corner of the outdoor plaza, within sight of a storefront that’s home to The Playroom NYC, a children’s amusement center.\nLongtime resident Andrea Nathanson — whose second-floor apartment is directly over Hood’s regular singing spot — said she’s ready to move after getting her first good night of sleep in months while on vacation in California last week.\n“I don’t care if he’s defecating, if he would just shut the f- -k up, I’d be happy,” said Nathanson, 63.\n“I have called the cops personally 10 times, and I have called down and asked the front desk to call the police over 40 times.”\n“The police are his buddies! They are always out here, yukking it up with him. They don’t want to arrest him because they know it’s useless paperwork. He’ll just be right back here,” she added.\nNathanson cut short her rant when a female neighbor interjected, “You’re going to lower our property values!”\nOnline listings show two apartments currently for sale — including a 16th-floor, two-bedroom in contract for $1.6 million-plus — and seven rentals ranging from $3,600 to $8,995 a month.\nThe NYPD said it had received 14 calls through 911 regarding a disorderly person matching Hood’s description since Jan. 1. City records show 40 complaints to 311 from building residents about homeless people, public drinking and “loud talking” on the street since September 2015.\nJames Messerschmidt Hood told The Post he had no plans to leave the area.\n“I have been here since 2008, and I don’t get along with people at shelters, so I would rather be here,” he said.\nHe admitted urinating “in the bushes” but denied doing anything worse.\nHood also claimed to suffer from paranoia, depression and panic attacks, and showed off a wristband from the nearby top-ranked New York Hospital.\n“I love when the police come because they know I don’t do s- -t, especially Officer Murphy from the 19th Precinct,” he said.\n“The worst thing they do is take me to a hospital for the night.”\nCity Hall referred questions to the NYPD, which said Hood “wasn’t happy with the housing” the Department of Homeless Services provided him in January, adding, “The NYPD is currently working with DHS to find him new housing.”\nDHS spokesman Isaac McGinn said: “It can take anywhere from one dozen to more than 200 contacts to bring street homeless New Yorkers indoors.”\nAdditional reporting by Shawn Cohen \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:04:23.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
