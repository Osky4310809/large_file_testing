Some women resent his assertions that they are weak, and liable to turn into “demons” when they take on jobs or activities traditionally reserved for men. Citizens of neighbouring Nepal may grimace at statements such as one on his website declaring that, for its own defence, India must preserve its smaller neighbour as a “Hindu Nation” by destroying “Muslim and Christian separatist forces working under the shield of Maoists”. (Muslims and Christians make up less than 6% of Nepal’s population.) India’s own 180m Muslims, in particular, find Mr Adityanath scary. Time and again he has warned of an alleged “love jihad ” to convert unwary Hindu girls to Islam, and of the existential threat from rising numbers of Muslims. He often denounces the imaginary flight of Hindus from Muslim persecution of some sort or another. Time and again in UP, such talk has helped turn ordinary scuffles into ugly sectarian clashes. Earlier this month India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, celebrated his party’s crushing triumph in UP state elections with a soothing speech on the need to unite for the common good. Yet shortly afterwards, he appointed Mr Adityanath to run the state. Some say that Mr Modi’s calculations are political. For the first half of his term he pandered mostly to better-off, better-educated city folk; the choice of a firebrand priest is meant to placate a different and restless demographic, his party’s rural Hindu-nationalist base. Others ascribe the move to ideology: Mr Modi’s big win in UP suggests there are few rivals to challenge his party in the next national election, in 2019, freeing it to carry out its religiously inspired mission. Mr Adityanath has already shut down slaughterhouses and butcher shops suspected of handling beef, and has set up an “anti-Romeo squad” to hunt love jihadists and other predators. But the best indication of his intentions will be Ayodhya. Hindu-nationalist “moderates” have long counselled patience regarding the building of the Ram temple; hardline groups say they want it to happen now. Which approach will Mr Adityanath take?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T09:29:21.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
