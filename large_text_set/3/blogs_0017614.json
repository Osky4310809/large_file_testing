So what is it we've been doing wrong? \nThe method the majority of us practise is to boil the potatoes , drain them and then add butter/milk/cheese before mashing it all together. This is where we've been going wrong \nNot only does this do the dish a disservice, but what's worse is it also means we've been eating tasteless mashed potato all this time without even realising. \nFood Network chef Tyler Florence spoke to Popsugar on the matter: \n\"Potatoes have a really delicate, beautiful minerality to their flavour profile, and when you cook potatoes in water and you pour that water down the drain, you've extracted all the flavour of the potato.\" Read More This method will ensure your mash is more flavoursome \nSo it's that first step which is where we're going wrong. \nInstead of boiling our spuds in water, Tyler advises cooking them IN the cream, milk and butter. \nSimply pop the chopped raw potatoes in a pot with all the dairy goodness you'd be adding later and let them all cook together, soaking up all those flavours.

I pour the potatoes through the colander, and the cream will collect on the bottom. \n\"Then I'll put the potatoes back into the pot and take the potato-infused garlic cream and fold that back into the potatoes, and itâ€™s the most incredible flavour profile.\" \nNot only have we learnt from this advice, but it's also made us incredibly hungry.
