As a star who is continuously tweaking his persona, Bieber frequently stumbles onto the newest craze, but fashion isn’t the only area where he’s ahead of the curve. Back in 2012 he discovered singer Madison Beer via her YouTube videos of cover songs. Even in those clips it was clear the telegenic teen had all the makings of a pop princess: She can belt out a ballad with the best of them and, much like Bieber himself, she had an affinity for athleisure style. \nOn Snapchat Beer posts previews from her debut album, due out later this year. Meanwhile, on Instagram, Beer is an appealing presence, too. She regularly updates her feed with outfits that connote a laid-back Hollywood vibe. Sporting Thrasher hoodies, ribbon chokers, and cropped tops with ripped jeans, she embodies fashion’s current obsession with all things sexy and ’90s-influenced. A love of It accessories led her to Chanel backpacks and miniature Céline bags worn with mirrored sunglasses and layered Cartier Love bracelets. She also happens to be a bona fide sneakerhead. With a collection of Yeezys, Nike high-tops, and Adidas Stan Smiths, Beer isn’t afraid of pairing Pumas with a minidress or going luxe with Valentino slip-ons. \nBetter still, Beer intersperses her outfit-of-the-day images with posts about body positivity and media scrutiny. After all, these days you can’t be a musician without also having a perspective on fashion. Whether that means diving headfirst into merch and designer collaborations or adopting a strong personal sense of style, pop stars use clothes as a means of defining themselves. For Beer, that means keeping her wardrobe fresh, while reminding her fans she’s about more than just a trend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:49:55.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
