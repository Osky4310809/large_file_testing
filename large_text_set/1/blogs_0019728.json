Rescuer. pic.twitter.com/ikcFzEj26H \n\"It was very good, intense, with goals on both sides,\" he told beIN Sports. \"The draw is fair given what we saw in the game. \n\"We always want to win. It's never good to drop two points. \n\"Given how the game was set, with us winning, we had control and we had chances to score one more goal. But we didn't take advantage of them and they equalised. \n\"In the end, a stroke of genius from Griezmann got us the draw.\" \nDe Marcos powered home a header early in the second half to cap his first start since November 6. \nThe 27-year-old was thrilled to be back following a foot injury but was disappointed not to hold on for the victory that would have taken them level with sixth-place Villarreal. \n\"I really wanted to help the team. It's been two months, a long time, and I'm not used to that,\" he said. \n\"It's a shame that we lost the points, the team was very good and we did enough to deserve to take all three. \n\"But they're a great team, they always run you close.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:44:01.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
