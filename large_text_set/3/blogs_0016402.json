But because DeFrange had directed the big bank that kept Winter Park funded, he understood the resort’s troubled financial condition. \n“I had to think about it,” DeFrange said. “I knew there were serious issues and I was giving up a 27-year career in banking.” \nAs soon as he took the job in 1997, the banking group that kept Winter Park viable announced it could not extend the debt-laden ski area any more credit. \nIn his first few months on the job, DeFrange realized there was a strong chance Winter Park could not stay open through the following summer. \nLuckily, his marketing team had an idea. They offered a friends-and-family four-pack ski pass for $800 and sold it in the spring — likely the first season pass offered half a year before the season even began. It also slashed nearly $500 off the price of a season pass. It was a resounding success, funneling summer cash into the ski area and sparking what would become an industry-shifting season pass war that today has moved the resort industry away from a reliance on real estate development. \nBut those four-pack passes alone weren’t enough to save Winter Park, which sent $2 million in rent a year to Denver, but got little back in reinvestment in the ski area. \nAfter a particularly lean snow year in the 1999-2000 season, when visitation fell by more than 80,000, DeFrange and Winter Park’s 25-person advisory board presented a scenario to then-Denver Mayor Wellington Webb: Quit taking the $2 million a year, or sell the ski area the city opened in 1939 as a crown jewel of its growing mountain park system. \nWebb didn’t want to be known as the mayor who sold Winter Park, so he found another option. \nAfter a bidding war, Webb secured a long-term lease with Intrawest. The then-goliath resort company promised to pay rent and immediately invest $50 million in the ski area in exchange for developing and selling base-area real estate. \nThe company has invested nearly $60 million, replacing aging lifts, expanding into new ski terrain and developing 40 miles of trails to become the nation’s largest downhill bike park and building the Lunch Rock restaurant atop Mary Jane. When it came time to recoup that investment, Intrawest’s first slope-side condos and a new resort village hit the market in the fall of 2008, just as the mountain real estate market collapsed into the national housing crisis that triggered the Great Recession. \n“That was a tough time for us,” DeFrange said. \nThe economic downturn hurt Intrawest, which today is a shadow of the company that secured the 76-year lease agreement with Denver 15 years ago. The hedge fund-owned company nearly disappeared in 2009, unable to service a massive debt. It jettisoned properties but, since 2002, Intrawest has kept up the rent and incentive payments to the city of Denver, which total about $3.5 million a year. \nAfter struggling buyers flooded the market with their Intrawest condos during the economic downturn, the resort operator held off building anything new. Only now is the company close to announcing new residential projects that could help buoy its investment. \nDeFrange has spent 20 years as Winter Park’s point man for the city of Denver, the community of the Fraser Valley and Intrawest. He is only the third resort boss at Winter Park since 1939, following Steve Bradley and Groswold. \n“He has built and preserved a culture that benefits the guest, it benefits his employees, it benefits the city and the Winter Park, Grand County communities in a very positive way,” said Bill Jensen, the ski industry veteran who once served as DeFrange’s boss as president of Intrawest and now co-owns and runs the Telluride ski area. “Gary is very even-keeled and an exceptional listener. I found him thoughtful in every decision he ever made and always kept his eye on the big picture.” \nDeFrange’s connections with the Denver and Fraser Valley communities eased not only the transition to Intrawest, but the resort industry’s more recent adjustment back to the ski experience. \n“I think Winter Park — both the town and resort — were really lucky having Gary come in as CEO when he did. He’s done a really good job of operating the ski area but he also had the community at heart,” said Nick Teverbaugh, who spent 26 years as Winter Park’s mayor before retiring in 2008. “There have been a lot of changes in the dynamics of the ski area and the community and it’s really helped to have someone like Gary in that position because he really cared about the community.” \nAnd the nearly decade-long break in building might be a good thing. The village model — with retail on the ground floor and several layers of condos up top, all coming online in sudden bursts — is not as popular as it once was, when Intrawest was the world’s top village-building ski area developer. Andy Cross, The Denver Post Winter Park Ski resort President and CEO Gary DeFrange, left, talks with competition skier Michael Murphy, center, and Scott Olson, head race coach for the National Sports Center for the Disabled on March 8, 2017 in Winter Park. \n“The model has clearly changed. Not just for us but for the entire industry, and it’s going to be interesting to watch that play out,” said DeFrange, who imagines new village development will include small clusters of ski area condos and homes, not the hundreds-at-a-time model of the late 1990s and early 2000s. “I’ve been involved in a lot of business when I was at the bank and I know business models change over time. The ski industry is in the process of going through that. We are lucky. We can rewrite the book.” \nDeFrange is quick to praise Intrawest. Without that initial investment, the resort would not be viable, especially not in an age when Vail Resorts funnels hundreds of millions into the ski experience to bolster the sale of its Epic Pass. \n“Had Intrawest not stepped in, this resort would not be what it is today. It was on the downhill slide and not because anyone did anything wrong,” he said. “But the model for writing a check for $2 million and not putting anything back into the resort just didn’t work.” \nDeFrange counts corralling Amtrak, Union-Pacific, the city of Denver and Intrawest into reviving ski train service between the resort and Denver’s Union Station among his victories. Launching in January, nearly every seat on the weekend trains is filled. Demand is well beyond expectations, he said. \nHe can’t help but go greet visitors on the new station Intrawest built at the base of the ski area. \n“I’ve had people stop me in the platform and say, ‘Man, this is great. We came in from Minneapolis and we didn’t have to rent a car or get in a van,’” he said. “People love taking the train.” \nIntrawest chief operating officer Sky Foulkes, a Colorado State University graduate and former ski patroller who ran Vermont’s Stratton Mountain ski area for seven years, will replace DeFrange. \nThe shift comes as Intrawest is reported to be pursuing a potential sale with its hedge-fund owner Fortress Investment Group working with investment banks. DeFrange, not surprisingly, has little to say about that. He said he hasn’t been entertaining any potential buyers and the city of Denver hasn’t reported any indication of a change in the city’s contract with Intrawest. \nDeFrange expects Foulkes will oversee a revitalized effort by Intrawest to finish the base village, possibly starting by replacing the aging Balcony House with a flagship hotel. \nThe resort has more than 900 acres of skiable terrain in its permit boundary in the under-utilized Vasquez Basin, an area ripe for new chairlifts and expanded skiing. And Intrawest has many parcels available for development at the base. \nBut that’s another leader’s job now. DeFrange plans to travel with his wife, Michelle, and do more than wax his collection of five Corvettes, a stable that includes a classic 1965 Nassau Blue convertible Stingray. He is going to work on his golf game. Maybe do some writing. If he skis, it will be for fun. It’s surprising how many executives in the resort industry admit they often are too busy to ski. \n“I’m not going to miss this,” he said, sliding a radio into his ski jacket before leaving his office for a few turns. \nHis departure follows Chris Diamond , who recently left the helm of Steamboat ski area after more than 40 years in the industry, and is emblematic of a changing guard in the industry. \n“It’s a loss of experience that our industry is dealing with right now, as we see years and years, decades if not centuries of experience living in this industry lost as people like Gary retire,” Mills said.
