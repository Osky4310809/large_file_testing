The bike was returned to the owner of the store. \n“We were able to develop a suspect description fairly quickly. That description was broadcasted to officers and a Zone 2 officer actually spotted a male matching the description and also pushing a bike at the Birmingham Bridge off-ramp and Forbes Avenue,” Schaffer said. \nPolice say McCoy had blood all over his hands and a cut on one of his fingers. While in custody, police say he became belligerent with officers. \nIn fact, he told one officer, “I’ll shoot you in the head when I get out and kill your family.” \nPolice say he then spit on an officer before he was taken to UPMC Mercy Hospital, was combative with the nursing staff there then transported to jail. \nAbout an hour earlier, police responded to the intersection of South 19th Street and Merriman Way for reports of a fight. When police got to the scene, they found a 25-year-old man with a stab wound to the leg. \n“Based on our investigation, we believe the 25-year-old male victim was sleeping in his car with his girlfriend, someone came up, a black male came up and asked for a cigarette,” Pittsburgh Police Spokeswoman Emily Schaffer said. \nSome type of argument took place and the victim was taken to UPMC Mercy Hospital in stable condition. \nIt’s unclear if McCoy is responsible for the stabbing. \nMeanwhile, he is currently being held in the Allegheny County Jail on charges of burglary, aggravated assault, theft and terroristic threats. \nStay With KDKA.com For More Details", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T01:15:54.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
