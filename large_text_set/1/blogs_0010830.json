Clowns bringing guns to school, clowns luring children into the woods, clowns threatening police officers, and clowns making concerning claims on Facebook. \nThis only exacerbated that natural and longstanding fear of clowns: the painted-on smile, the huge eyes that never blink — it hardly requires explanation. Clowns are terrifying.\nWhy not turn this terror into a fun vacay? \n\nIf you're feeling particularly daring — or if you're recommending travel options to your worst enemy — check out the Clown Motel in Tonopah, Nevada. A photo posted by Sharlynn Vee (@sv1) on Oct 20, 2016 at 12:50am PDT \n\nConveniently, it's hidden away in a tiny town with a population of fewer than 3,000 people — in the middle of the desert — so no one will hear your screams. \nA photo posted by Rachael (@rachaelnp) on Nov 10, 2016 at 8:16am PST \n\nSince the concept alone isn't creepy enough, the motel shares a lot with the former mining town's old cemetery which was operational until 1911.\nSo, you'll likely get a sweet view of headstones commemorating perished miners. \n\nThe nightmare-come-alive has been in operation for over twenty years — and won the distinction of \"America's Scariest Motel.\" A photo posted by DEATHstination™ with Laura (@deathstination) on Jun 14, 2016 at 8:27pm PDT \n\nThe motel has been remodeled recently to accommodate the influx tourists — who even have a choice between smoking and non-smoking rooms. Management has clearly put a lot of thought into the details, as evidenced by the 500 clowns decorating the lobby alone. \nA photo posted by Sergio Meza (@morningharvester) on Nov 5, 2016 at 10:01pm PDT \n\nWe're sure you'll sleep just fine tonight. \n\nNaturally, the (potentially homicidal) clown theme extends to the actual rooms. A photo posted by Bill Mandra (@wmandra) on Dec 26, 2016 at 2:05pm PST \n\nEach room welcomes you with a clown on the door and portraits of (in)famous clowns cover the walls. \nA photo posted by Tyler Monsein (@monsein) on Nov 9, 2016 at 5:30pm PST \n\nBut hey — you get free wifi and \"mini breakfast,\" pets are allowed, and guests seem to emerge from their rooms in the mornings. \n...Well, that we know of. \n\nSo, where will you be spending your next vacation? A photo posted by Mark (@februaryxvi) on Dec 23, 2016 at 3:28pm PST \n\nA single room is $39.50. Bozo is waiting for you.
