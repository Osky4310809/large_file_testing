Now the same source has posted another concept video of the Nokia P1 alongside the Nokia 8, which is expected to be a flagship offering. \nTalking about the Nokia 8 concept first, the video reveals that the phone will come with a heart rate sensor, which will be located beside the primary snapper. The device will get a dual-LED flash for the main camera. It will feature slim bezels and a glass back panel, and a physical home button that’s expected to hide a fingerprint sensor beneath. \nThe Nokia P1 concept video suggests that it will feature a triple-LED flash on the back. It will feature a metallic frame, slim bezels and a home button, which is also expected to double up as a fingerprint sensor. \nIt’s worth mentioning that the concept teaser videos of the Nokia P1 and Nokia 8 are based on preliminary leaks, so they aren’t representative of the final product. HMD Global is expected to unveil these devices at its pre-MWC event on February 26th in Barcelona.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:45:04.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
