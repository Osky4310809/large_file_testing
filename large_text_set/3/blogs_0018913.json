Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos will not benefit from the impeachment complaint he filed against Vice President Leni Robredo. Philstar.com/Efigenio Toledo IV, File MANILA, Philippines â€” The lawyer behind the impeachment complaint filed against Vice President Leni Robredo said Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. would not benefit from it. Lawyer Oliver Lozano, chairman of the Marcos Loyalist Incorporated, earlier filed an impeachment complaint against the vice president for \"betrayal on public trust\" in sending a video message criticizing President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs. Lozano told GMA's \"News to Go\" on Wednesday that the Supreme Court (SC) holds exclusive control and jurisdiction on the electoral protest filed by Marcos. \"Wala kang magagawa para maimpluwensyahan ang Supreme Court,\" Lozano said. Last year, Marcos filed an electoral protest against Robredo before the high court acting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), accusing her of cheating in the 2016 elections. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, meanwhile, said on Monday that Marcos might not be next in line if Robredo is removed from her post. \"Under our law, it is the third highest official that shall immediately succeed the vacancy in the vice president post,\" Aguirre explained. READ: With Leni threatened, Bongbong to push protest According to Article VII Section 9 of the 1987 Constitution, whenever there is a vacancy in the Office of the Vice President, the president shall nominate a vice president from among the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives who shall assume office upon confirmation by a majority vote of all the members of both Houses of the Congress voting separately. Aguirre argued, however, that Marcos could claim the post if the PET favored the electoral protest he filed in its resolution. \"If the PET rules later on in favor of the protest, then Bongbong will take over the post,\" Aguirre said.
