He also signed a bill preventing \"cities, towns, and counties from enacting any local ordinances prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity and sexuality.\" Now, it appears that legacy is haunting McCrory. \nThe guy who made it legal to discriminate against LGBTQ people in North Carolina now says he's become a victim of prejudice—apparently, he can't find a job, the News & Observer reports . On an evangelical Christian podcast, the ex-governor said Monday that HB-2 \"has impacted me to this day, even after I left office. People are reluctant to hire me, because, 'Oh my gosh, he's a bigot'—which is the last thing I am.\" \nComplaining of left-leaning groups harming his reputation, McCrory continued, \"If you disagree with the politically correct thought police on this new definition of gender, you're a bigot, you're the worst of evil.\" \nThe News & Observer reported that in response the North Carolina Democratic Party spokesman Mike Gwin said, \"North Carolina has already lost hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity and thousands of jobs as a direct result of House Bill 2, but I guess we can start adding Governor McCrory's career to the total as well.\" \nIn the immortal words of DJ Khaled: \"You played yourself, Pat McCrory.\" \nFollow Eve Peyser on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:06:02.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
