Graham Inquirer Staff Writer \nKristen Graham has covered the Philadelphia School District since May 2008. A native Philadelphian – and a product of the district and Temple University – she has written about everything from crime and county government to education since joining the Inquirer in 2000. If asked politely, Kristen, who has also spent time as an online producer at Philly.com, will sing as much of “Hail Northeast,” her high school’s alma mater, as she remembers. She comes from a family of teachers and believes there is no more difficult or important job than that of an educator. \nKristen is a Pulitzer Prize winner, part of a team whose \"Assault on Learning\" series about violence in the Philadelphia schools won the 2012 prize for public service for the Inquirer. During the school year, you’ll frequently find her chatting live on Philly.com about the district. Please do pass along the scoop about what’s going on at your Philadelphia public school; Kristen welcomes tips, story ideas and witty banter at kgraham@phillynews.com or 215-854-5146. \nYou can also find her on Twitter here . More by Kristen A. Graham Arrow icon \nIt took teacher George Bezanis just five days to raise enough money to buy a billboard shaming Mayor Kenney and Philadelphia School District leaders for allowing teachers to go nearly four years without a contract and five without a raise. \nBeginning Feb. 27, the billboard proclaiming \"Welcome to Philadelphia, where we don't value our public school children, 5+ years without a raise for our teachers, with love, SRC, Mayor Kenney and superintendent\" will appear on 95 South between the Girard Avenue and Center City exits. \nBezanis needed $5,000, but has raised $5,255 through a GoFundMe page to date. He's going to continue accepting donations, however, with the goal of keeping the message up for as long as the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers has no contract — or as long as the donations last. \nBezanis, who teaches at Central High, dreamed up the idea out of frustration. \n\"As each month passes with no agreement in sight, Philadelphia loses more and more great educators to other surrounding districts,\" he wrote in his original fundraising plea. \"It is the over 100,000 children in the district, however, who suffer the most because of this lack of a stable workforce.\" \nA veteran educator of 10 years, Bezanis himself has lost $38,958 in promised pay increases, he said. \nHe's gratified and surprised by how quickly the campaign got funded, said Bezanis, who lives in the city and sends his children to public school. \nDonations poured in — $5 here, $25 there. One person offered $20 — \"school district teacher forced to work 2 jobs to take care of me and my family,\" she wrote. \nBezanis, who often speaks out at SRC meetings as highly critical of district leadership, is acting alone in the campaign — it is not endorsed by the PFT. \nBoth the mayor's office and the school district have said they are doing their best to get the teachers a fair contract. \nOtis Hackney, Kenney's chief education officer, has said the city is actively involved in trying to spur negotiations, and that given President Trump's administration's stance on public education, \"we appreciate the importance of resolving this contract as quickly as possible.\" \nLee Whack, spokesman for the school system, has said that the district wants a pact that treats teachers fairly \"but also retains the fiscal stability that the district has fought so hard for.\" More Coverage ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:22:22.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
