(Photo: Getty Images) More In an interview with Ainsley Earhardt on Fox & Friends on Wednesday, Donald Trump hit back at comments designer Tom Ford made regarding whether he would dress the president-elect’s wife, Melania Trump . Ford, the American designer who worked at top fashion houses Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent before starting his eponymous label, recently shared his feelings about dressing Melania Trump , saying, “She’s not necessarily my image. I was asked to dress her quite a few years ago. I declined.” However, Donald Trump denied that claim during Wednesday’s interview on Fox & Friends . The president-elect said his wife has “never asked Tom Ford, doesn’t like Tom Ford, doesn’t like his designs.” President-elect #DonaldTrump on #TomFord refusing to dress #MelaniaTrump : \"He was never asked to dress [Melania]… I’m not a fan of Tom Ford\" pic.twitter.com/1PmMPWs9zk \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 18, 2017 Trump added, “Tom Ford is an example. ‘I will not dress the first lady.’ He was never asked to dress… and Steve Wynn just called me, and he said he thought it was so terrible what Tom Ford said that he threw his clothing out of his Las Vegas hotel.” Wynn, a billionaire American real estate businessman and developer of resorts like the Mirage, Bellagio, and Wynn Las Vegas, has known the president-elect for a number of years and even attended Trump’s wedding to Melania in 2005. Wynn Las Vegas spokesman Michael Weaver confirmed the Las Vegas hotel removed the Tom Ford line of cosmetics and sunglasses from its stores over the weekend but declined to say why, according to the Associated Press . Although Wynn notably chose not to endorse a candidate during the 2016 presidential election, it seems as if the magnate and Trump will work together in the future, as the 74-year-old is a member of Trump’s Presidential Inaugural Committee . Many designers have chosen to speak out against dressing Melania Trump. This has brought increased interest regarding what she will wear to the inauguration on Friday, and many media outlets have speculated that iconic American designer Ralph Lauren will dress the future first lady.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:00:59.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
