We don’t know if all insured Americans will go back to paying a copay for birth control, which would likely make the highly effective LARC methods more expensive than other methods like the pill or ring. Already, birth control users are tweeting about getting the IUD and making appointments to get them put in now, just in case. “If there are fewer women with health insurance, or health insurance that doesn’t cover contraceptives, then women are not going to have the same capacity to prevent unplanned pregnancy,” says Jones.\nID: 10747493 9. What we do know is that low-income women have a higher rate of unplanned pregnancy, and factors like Title X and Medicaid expansion have been helping many of them access free or low-cost birth control, which can bring that rate down.

In case you’re unfamiliar with these: \nTitle X is a federal grant program that provides funding for family planning services for low-income or uninsured individuals. It was created in 1970, is administered by the US Department of Health & Human Services, and distributes funds to various clinics, hospitals, and non-profits. Title X funds may not be used for abortion, but they can be used for birth control and other important family planning services. Medicaid expansion refers to states where you can qualify for Medicaid based on income alone (making below 133% of the federal poverty level). Medicaid provides free or low-cost health insurance for low-income individuals. Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood and other federally qualified health centers mean that someone with Medicaid can go to these centers for free or low-cost family planning services, but the Hyde Amendment blocks any Medicaid funding for abortion services (except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is in danger). “To cut Medicaid expansion coverage or to reduce funding to Title X, anything you do like that reduces either the number of women who have coverage or the number of places they can go to use that coverage,” says Fey. “Both of those pieces would have a profound effect on the ability to continue making progress in terms of reducing unplanned pregnancy and abortion.”\nID: 10743245 10. And then there’s Planned Parenthood. “Defunding” Planned Parenthood — which Republicans in Congress want — would prohibit them from getting Medicaid reimbursements or Title X funds, which means they could no longer serve low-income patients that rely on those programs. View this image › \n@zoebuckman / Via instagram.com The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office also says that could drive unplanned pregnancies back up as it “would affect services that help women avert pregnancies” and would most significantly affect people in areas where there are no other clinics that serve low-income patients. They project that about 15% of these people would lose access to care. \nHere’s the clincher: “By CBO’s estimates, in the one-year period in which federal funds for Planned Parenthood would be prohibited under the legislation, the number of births in the Medicaid program would increase by several thousand, increasing direct spending for Medicaid by $21 million in 2017 and by $77 million over the 2017-2026 period.”\nID: 10747571 11. If birth control and family planning services remain accessible and affordable, Fey says we can anticipate more increases in the most effective birth control methods and further declines in unplanned pregnancies. “What you don’t want to do is go back.” ID: 10747731 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:02:53.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
