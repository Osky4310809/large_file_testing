Amby Burfoot Wednesday, March 22, 2017, 4:51 pm Leonard Korir earned his spot at the world cross-country championships in Uganda by winning the U.S. qualifying race on a muddy course in Bend, Oregon. Victor Sailer/Photo Run \nThe biennial IAAF World Cross-Country Championships return to the major-event calendar this weekend with five races scheduled for Sunday in Kampala, Uganda. The U.S. has sent five full teams, including senior men’s and women’s teams and two under-20 teams, with six runners on each team. \nIn addition, the U.S. has also entered a four-person mixed team (two men, two women) in a 4 x 2K relay race being contested for the first time at world cross country. The mixed race has drawn 13 international teams, and one athlete refugee team guided by former Kenyan marathon great Tegla Loroupe.

For example, one team might run: male-male-female-female, while another team might choose the opposite order. Members of the U.S. senior and under-20 teams selected themselves at the USATF Cross-Country Championships on February 4 in Bend, Oregon. In that competition, the winners were Leonard Korir (senior men), Aliphine Tuliamuk (senior women), Paul Roberts (junior men), and Michelle Magnani (junior women). All four are in Uganda to race. \nRelated: The U.S. Cross Country Championships Turn Into a Mud Run \nThe four members of the U.S. mixed team were chosen from the races in Bend (Marisa Howard, 16th) or from recent indoor track results. The top runner on the mixed team, Paul Chelimo, took the silver medal in 5,000 meters at the Rio Olympics last summer, and on March 4 he won the USATF indoor two-mile title in 8:28.53. \nVeteran coaches Ed Eyestone and Dena Evans will lead the U.S. teams. As an elite competitor in the 1980s, Eyestone placed third in the world cross-country junior race in 1980, and four times competed in the senior race, with a top finish of sixth in 1984. This is Evans’s fourth stint with a U.S. world cross-country team. “These are wonderful opportunities for coaches to support U.S. athletes at an international event and for post-collegiate athletes to be part of a team experience that means more when combined with the work of others,” Evans said. \nWorld cross country has been dominated in recent decades by Kenyan and Ethiopian runners. The two countries have won all senior men’s team titles since 1981 and all senior women’s titles since 1991. Some countries that used to enthusiastically participate at the world cross-country championships now send no team or limited teams. For example, Great Britain, famed for its cross-country history, will have a 16-member team in Kampala, but there will be no senior men. \nAt the height of its popularity 20 years ago, the world cross-country meet attracted more than 700 racers from around the globe. This year, the IAAF is hoping for about 550 runners, including about 60 in the new mixed race, which should attract some additional attention to the event. Next month’s World Relays in the Bahamas will also include a mixed race—a 4 x 400 meters, with two men and two women per team. \nRelated: Two Dramatic Photos Show What Can Happen in Cross Country \n“I’m thrilled to be competing in the inaugural mixed race,” said U.S. team member Marisa Howard. “No one knows what to expect, but I’m picturing all us relay-team members cheering each other on as we chase after one shared goal. I think the new race could bring some new viewers to the sport, as it has never been seen before.” \nThe last world cross-country championships were held two years ago in Guiyang, China, with Kenya’s Geoffrey Kipsang and Agnes Jibet winning the individual senior titles. Ethiopia won both senior team titles, with Kenya second in both. \nThe top individual U.S. finishers in China were Chris Derrick , 24th, and Sara Hall , 20th, while the U.S. senior men placed seventh and the women were fifth. The last Americans to finish in the individual top 10 were Ben True , who was sixth in 2013, and Shalane Flanagan , who was third in 2011. \nThe U.S. men’s team placed second in 2013, while the women were third in 2010 and 2011. After 2011, the world cross-country schedule switched over to its current every-other-year status. \nDespite the seemingly long odds for U.S. runners in Kampala, Evans has a positive outlook. “Anytime the U.S. competes on the international stage, we expect to be in the mix,” she said. “I think U.S. runners have made a case for that the last several years, particularly on the track, and I hope they’ve gained a confidence that spills over to their performances in Kampala.” \nSenior Women:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:25:28.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
