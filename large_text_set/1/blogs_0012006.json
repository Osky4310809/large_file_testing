While few details about this week’s episode of SmackDown LIVE had been released as of Sunday evening, Jerry Lawler did announce via Twitter that he would be hosting a new edition of The King’s Court , although he didn’t announce yet who his guest will be. And with only four superstars from the blue brand announced as competitors in the Royal Rumble Match, it seems likely that several SmackDown wrestlers will officially be added to the 30-man battle royal that officially begins the “Road to WrestleMania 34 .” That's right…The King's Court returns this Tuesday night on #SmackDownLive on @USA_Network pic.twitter.com/3Ih7Fwqluk \n— Jerry Lawler (@JerryLawler) January 14, 2017 \nWith the Monday Night Raw brand already responsible for the first-ever Women’s Championship Hell in a Cell Match, SmackDown LIVE will host the first-ever Women’s Championship Match inside a Steel Cage. This match was booked specifically to keep La Luchadora from interfering, while speculation continues about who is really under the mask. This will be a chance for Alexa Bliss and Becky Lynch to prove that they can headline their brand’s show just like Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks have done on Monday Night Raw . \nJerry Lawler, whose role on WWE programming has been severely cut back as of late, will return to SmackDown LIVE in his hometown of Memphis to host a new King’s Court segment, something the WWE Universe hasn’t seen since the Attitude Era. Undoubtedly, The King will bring up the Royal Rumble , but his actual guest has not yet been revealed. \nSo far, Dean Ambrose, Dolph Ziggler, Baron Corbin and The Miz are the only members of SmackDown LIVE that have officially announced their entry into the Royal Rumble Match . With both John Cena and AJ Styles competing in the WWE Championship Match, Shane McMahon and Daniel Bryan have to choose from what’s left on their roster. Big names like Randy Orton, Bray Wyatt and Kane will almost certainly be a part of the Royal Rumble Match, but who will make the official announcement on SmackDown this week? \nThe question still remains whether anyone from the red brand’s Cruiserweight Division — the stars of 205 Live — will participate in the 30-man battle royal at WWE’s January PPV. If they are, they will likely make that announcement on this week’s episode of WWE 205 Live , right after SmackDown LIVE . While no official preview had been posted by WWE as of Sunday evening, the drama between Neville and Rich Swann will likely escalate on this week’s episode, as will the Jack Gallagher/Ariya Daivari feud and the Cedric Alexander/Alicia Fox/Noam Dar love triangle. \nRELATED REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T02:17:12.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
