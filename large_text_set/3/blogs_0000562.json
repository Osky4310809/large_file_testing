By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 3, 2017 3:28 PM UP Elections 2017: Mayawati targeted the deometisation move and asked BJP to reveal the amount of money deposited in the banks. (Source: PTI) \nAs we head towards the final phase of voting in Uttar Pradesh, things are heating up in the political corridors of the state. On Friday afternoon, BSP Chief Mayawati attacked Bharatiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing a rally in Jaunpur district. She targeted the deometisation move and asked BJP to reveal the amount of money deposited in the banks. “BJP hid all black money before demonetisation. I ask them to tell how much money was deposited in the banks,” she said. \nTalking about the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister added BJP promised a lot of things to Indian farmers including those of Uttar Pradesh but haven’t delivered anything yet. “BJP is against dalits and adivasis. It is also against other backward classes,” Mayawati added. \nEven though there is a three-way race in Uttar Pradesh after Congress decided to join hands with Samajwadi Party, Mayawati looked confident about her party’s chances of winning elections. She said Bahujan Samaj Party will win by a huge margin as people realise most development works were not completed with full efficiency during Akhilesh Yadav government. \nWatch Mayawati addressing the rally at Jaunpur: \n— NationalVoice (@_NationalVoice) March 3, 2017 \nEarlier in the day, PM Narendra Modi also addressed a rally in Mirzapur and was in no mood to hold back as he clearly appealed to the crowd that only way to end corruption in Uttar Pradesh is by wiping out the Samajwadi Party, Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party from the state. He said there are four types of corruptions prevailing in UP: Nazrana (before the work is done), shukrana (after your work is done), hakrana (what they believe they are entitled to have) and jabrana (when they take money forcefully). \nModi said Rahul Gandhi came in contact with an electrical wire and said, don’t worry there is no electricity in the wires of Uttar Pradesh. However, all three parties will get electric current on March 11 when counting of votes will be done.
