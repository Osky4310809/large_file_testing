On the heels of a report this morning that sees The Get Down ‘s Yahya Abdul-Mateen II up for the villainous Black Manta role, The Hollywood Reporter brings word that Nicole Kidman has entered talks to play Aquaman’s mother, Atlanna. Both stars would join a lineup that currently includes Jason Momoa , Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe. \nRELATED: James Wan Says Aquaman Will be a Swashbuckling Action Adventure \nAquaman is set to feature the return of Momoa in the title role. Aquaman made a brief debut as the title character in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice . He’s expected to play a much larger role in the forthcoming Justice League , set to hit theaters November 17, 2017. The Zack Snyder film is also expected to introduce Heard as Mera, Queen of Atlantis. \nWhile the character’s origins have shifted a bit over the years Atlanna made her comic book debut in a flashback tale in 1959’s Adventure Comics #260. Initially, Atlanna — an Atlantean who fell in love with a human, Tom Curry — was depicted as having died before Aquaman came into prominence as a hero. In the modern New 52 continuity, however, Atlanna is a significantly more prominent character and faked her death in an effort to escape Atlantis’ oppressive rule. \nAquaman is expected to begin shooting in April. \nRELATED: James Wan Talks Aquaman and Mera’s Relationship in the Solo Film \nNext up in the big screen DC Comics universe is director Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman . Look for it to hit theaters on June 2, 2017. \nWhat do you think of Nicole Kidman in the Atlanna role?
