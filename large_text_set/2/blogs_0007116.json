Ringside debates have raged for decades over whether or not boxing gloves actually make the sport more dangerous, with the rationale being padded gloves allow for harder hits and longer fights, thus increasing the probability of head injury. But an experiment conducted by National Geographic , as covered by The Daily Star , begs to differ: When the production team had UFC legend Bas Rutten hit a punching bag wearing UFC gloves, boxing gloves, and no gloves at all, they found that bareknuckle Bas delivered the hardest hit. (See the video below.) \nWhen Rutten donned the boxing gloves, he hit with 641 pounds of force; he landed a 651-pound hit with MMA gloves, but a massive 776-pound hit without hand protection. And weirdly, boxing glove punches tend to hit faster than a bare punch, say Washington State University researchers . It’s worth noting the Nat Geo experiment has some flaws, chief among them Rutten himself, who is only one man and not definitively capable of delivering the exact same hit each time. But if the results are valid, then the point may be moot, as bareknuckle fights don’t last as long.
