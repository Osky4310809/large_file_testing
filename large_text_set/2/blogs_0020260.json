He will add scoring punch off the bench for the Wizards, who are in third place in the Eastern Conference. \nBy adding Bogdanovic, a pending restricted free agent, Washington continues its push to challenge the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers and Toronto Raptors in the East. \nThe deal was first reported by Yahoo Sports. \nCopyright Â© 2017 NBA Media Ventures, LLC.
