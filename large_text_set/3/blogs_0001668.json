Since then, Luis Enrique's team have not lost another game. Avoiding defeat this weekend would move their unbeaten streak to 19 games, encompassing all of the other teams in the Spanish top flight. \nStrangely, there's a feeling of renewed optimism and belief around Camp Nou going into the game. This, despite the fact the club's coach revealed after Wednesday's 6-1 win against Sporting Gijon -- which took Barca top of the league -- that he would not renew his contract beyond its June expiry. Barcelona Lineups and Stats \nIt's an announcement which has managed to shift the attention elsewhere and it may prove a good thing for the club. There was already a more positive feeling emanating from Luis Enrique's pregame news conference on Friday. \nParallels could even be drawn with Luis Enrique's first season, when in January 2015 the club was threatening to spiral into total crisis. The noise then wasn't exactly the same as the complaints which followed the four-goal defeat to Paris Saint-Germain last month, but it wasn't completely dissimilar. \nThe sacking of Andoni Zubizarreta and Josep Maria Bartomeu's decision to call an election for the summer, coupled with the birth of the Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar partnership on the pitch, somehow had a stabilising effect on the club. It laid the foundations for what proved to be a Treble-winning season. \nFrom everything being doomed following a 1-0 loss to Real Sociedad, Barca ended the season with the La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League crowns. \nIt's not out of the realm of possibility that Luis Enrique's announcement could have a similar effect -- even if their chances in the Champions League this season may already have evaporated. The boss seemed more relaxed and at ease than he had been in many months. He admitted himself that everything being out in the open had left him feeling \"relieved.\" Luis Enrique has cut a relaxed figure since announcing his decision to step down at season's end. \nEven before then, on Wednesday, he'd made decisions which he otherwise may not have made. Focusing on the football, he withdrew Suarez at half-time and then took Messi off with a full half-an-hour to play. It was just the second time in 2017 that the Argentine had been substituted -- before then he had played 1,324 of his side's 1350 minutes since the turn of the year. \nTherefore, as well as his public persona in front of the press, Luis Enrique may also be able to manage with more freedom. Of course, it would still be dangerous to unsettle Messi in the short term, but he will have a little more freedom to make decisions and to rotate safe in the knowledge he can't upset the apple cart for next season. Because he won't be there. \nThe first test of that theory comes against Celta, and is quickly followed by \"Mission Impossible\" against PSG on Wednesday, where a four-goal swing is required. Celta are a side who have proven they can mix it up with La Liga's best. They knocked Real Madrid out of the Copa del Rey earlier this year and beat Barca at Balaidos. They also beat them at Balaidos last season, while the year before they nicked a one-goal win at Camp Nou. \nLast season's visit of Celta provided happier memories for the Blaugrana , though. Not only was it a 6-1 win, but it will be remembered as one of the front three's best performances, and as the time Messi passed from the penalty spot and Suarez drilled home. \nA similar performance on Saturday would suggest that not only has Luis Enrique's announcement not had a negative effect on his players, it's freed them from any shackles they could have felt due to the uncertainty over their coach's future. \nOn top of that, they find themselves firmly back in the title race and with their best players slowly coming back into fitness. Andre Gomes missed training on Friday and Jeremy Mathieu and Aleix Vidal are currently sidelined. But those three aside, Luis Enrique can count on a full bill of health as he prepares for the visit of his former club. \nIf everything goes well at Camp Nou on Saturday, it will not only breed belief for the final three months of Luis Enrique's reign, but it will send comeback-fever in Catalonia ahead of PSG's visit into overdrive. There are few clubs in the world who know how to drill up a remontada narrative like Barca. \nSamuel Marsden covers Barcelona for ESPN FC.
