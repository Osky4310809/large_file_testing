Now popular gadget tipster Evan Blass aka @evleaks has posted an alleged render of the One X10, and suggests that the device will be unveiled later this month. \nAs per the source, the HTC One X10 will only be slightly different than its predecessor, the One X9 ( first impressions ). The X10 will be powered by a 1.9GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6755V/C processor, as compared to the 2.2GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6795 SoC present on its predecessor. The One X10 will allegedly offer a 5.5-inch full HD display, encased in an all-metal body. \nThe source further suggests that the One X10 will feature a 16.3-megapixel primary snapper and a 7.9-megapixel secondary shooter. Its pricing and exact launch date details are still unknown. If the report is correct, we will find out the official specs and availability of the device later this month, so stay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T13:31:38.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
