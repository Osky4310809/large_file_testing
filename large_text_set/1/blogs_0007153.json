If an unlucky star ventures too close, the black hole’s gravity tears it to shreds.

Garlick/CfA) \nBut anyway, scientists didn’t know about the gas clumping. “While tidal disruptions in the galactic center have been a subject of research since the late ‘80s, the idea that actual compact objects could form from this process is very new,” Girma told National Geographic. Advertisement \nSo, will we find one of these speedy orbs? A few of the balls stick around the Milky Way—the closest might even be a few hundred light years away, according to the release. But they’d be difficult to find, and even if we spotted one, its origin wouldn’t be clear to us. \nUntil then, every time you look up at the night sky, you can say to yourself, “Wow, there could be giant farts out there we don’t even know about.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:38:55.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
