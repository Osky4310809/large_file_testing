Clearly he wasn’t wearing his lucky pair the day he tried to shoot a retired cop. \nHot hand, cool head, totally bad dude. Hats off to hero Brian Harrison. \nPlease share on Facebook and Twitter as a tribute to cops everywhere, active and retired. What do you think of Brian Harrison's brave response to this punk?
