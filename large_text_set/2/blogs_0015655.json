But now Soulja Boy is claiming Brown is getting cold feet and won’t sign a contract for the event. \nSoulja Boy tweeted on Sunday (Feb. 19) that Brown is scared of him and went in on the singer. Eventually he decided that since Brown apparently doesn’t want to fight him, he’s going to leave him alone and said their beef was over. But, of course, he suggested his Twitter followers still go after Brown. \nThe timing of Soulja Boy’s claims are convenient, as the Atlanta rapper also announced he would be dropping his new Big Soulja mixtape Sunday night. \nBillboard has reached out to Soulja Boy’s rep for comment. See his tweets below.
