Now, it seems CLEAR is eager to continue its expansion, as users say they’ve received emails with invitations to invite their friends to try the service for free as part of a three-month trial period, which is much more generous than its typical one-month free trial offer. \nIf you received an email, you can forward to friends or family members that may be interested in trying the service. If you don’t receive an email from anyone, you can still use promo code DAYLIGHT3 when you register on CLEAR’s website . Note that the offer is only valid for new users who register by March 24 . Your membership will then be automatically renewed for a 12-month period at a cost of $179. \nIt’s also important to note that CLEAR offers discounted membership rates to Delta SkyMiles members . General members can purchase a year-long membership for $99, while Silver, Gold and Platinum members can buy one for $79 — it’s complimentary for Diamond members. \nI was able to register for the trial through the link in the email I received from another TPG team member, however there’s no place for you to enter your Delta SkyMiles information. After registering, I called CLEAR at (855)-253-2763 to give the agent my SkyMiles info with the hope that I’d be able to lock in the lower Delta SkyMiles member rate. Sure enough, after just a few questions, the agent told me my account would be renewed at the cost of $79 following the trial period because of my Silver Medallion status with the airline.
