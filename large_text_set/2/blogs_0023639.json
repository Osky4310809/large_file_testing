Hiroto Saikawa, currently co-CEO, will be the sole chief executive officer from April 1.\nFor more about Ghosn, watch: \n“Having recently taken on new responsibilities at Mitsubishi Motors … I have decided that the time is right for Hiroto Saikawa to succeed me as Nissan’s CEO,” Ghosn said in a statement.\n“As Nissan’s Chairman, I will continue to supervise and guide the company, both independently and within the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance,” he said, adding the move would allow him to devote more time to running the alliance.\nSaikawa, a 40-year Nissan veteran, has served as co-CEO since last November after the automaker took a controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Prior to that, he served as chief competitive officer, and also currently heads Japan’s auto industry lobby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:13:08.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
