It is not simply the fact that we have a brother or sister that influences the kind of a person we grow up to become, but also our birth order. Whether you are born first, last, or in the middle matters (Read more about this, on our website here ). But, what happens if you don't have siblings? Turns out, not having siblings is as impactful as having them. What this means is that only children are likely to have certain unique traits, which makes dating them a different ballgame. Only children are closer to their parents than many of us. A three member family is likely to be more involved with each other's lives than a four or five member family, where there are sub-units of contemporaries. Only children hold fewer secrets from their parents, and are usually more open and communicative with them. So, as their partner, you will also be required to form a bond with the parents (think of it like bonding with your S.O.'s sibling). They value personal space and alone time. They are used to it, and comfortable with it. So, if you're looking for a relationship where you are attached at the hip, this may not be it for you. On the plus side, it is wonderful to have a partner who understands the need for space. They are not loners or weirdos. Yes, they like alone time, but that doesn't make them incapable of loving forming close bonds. They like company. Just not all the time. They want your undivided attention. When you are with them, be with them, and nothing else. It's not that only children don't know how to share, but they have seen how great complete presence can be, and they want nothing else from their partners. They are self-reliant. They don't have a brother or a sister to get errands done. So, they have learnt how to do it all on their own. So, essentially, don't be offended if they would rather meet you at the designated spot for your coffee date, than have you pick them up. Likewise, if they are out and about with their friends or late at a party, they will figure out a way to get back home safely. They are more likely to divorce . Now, this doesn't mean anything other than the fact that not all people can understand the rhythm of an only child. There is nothing wrong with them. They just don't function in the same way as those of us who grew up with a sibling for company. They just need someone who is patient and understanding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:46:11.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
