Thanks to our friends over at Kinja, you can use the KINJA30 promotional code and get up to 30% off select electronics, up to a max discount of $30. That brings the price down to $369. Now if that weren’t enough to get you to bite, and you are a new customer to Jet.com, you can use the code TRIPLE15 on top of that and get another 15% off, up to a max discount of $30. That brings it all the way down to $339, which is a pretty great price for the Honor 8, especially a brand new one. \nFor those that may not have heard of the Honor 8 before, it’s a high-end smartphone from Huawei’s Honor brand, and it launched last summer in the US. It’s unlocked, and will work on GSM carriers like T-Mobile and AT&T. It sports a 5.2-inch 1080p display, powered by Huawei’s own Kirin 955 processor, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. There is also a micro SD card slot available, allowing you to expand the storage on the Honor 8. This is all powered by a 3000mAh battery, and it has Android 7.0 Nougat with EMUI 5 which is the latest version of Huawei’s own user interface.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:20:42.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
