He performed at the Los Angeles Repertory Theater and starred in several plays and musicals, before moving onto a career in film and television that would span over three decades.\nOn Tuesday, fans and comrades paid tribute to the iconic actor across Twitter.\nRichard Hatch was a good man, a gracious man, and a consummate professional.

He landed the Battlestar Galactica role in 1978.\nWhile he starred in some smaller film releases, it seems that Battlestar Galactica always held a special place in Hatch's heart. Throughout the 1990s, he wrote several novels based on the TV series and tried pitching for sequels to film execs for at least seven years — an experience that left him feeling \"exhausted and sick,\" as he told Sci-Fi Pulse in 2004.\nRIP Richard Hatch. He was the rare actor who held onto a true passion for the world he created long after the cameras stopped rolling.\n— Ben Lesnick (@banditloaf) February 7, 2017\nEventually, the idea of a Battlestar Galactica remake — not sequel — would come to fruition during the early 2000s. While it wasn't the original idea Hatch had pitched, he came around after hearing more about it from screenwriter Ron Moore.\nAnd with that, he would land a role on the same show he starred in two decades before.\n“As Ron talked about the part, it didn’t take long for me to see that this was a role that I would love to play,\" he told Sci-Fi Pulse . \"In a sense, I had been playing that role all my life, of fighting for the common person and helping people feel more empowered.\"\nBONUS: High School Students Create Battlestar Galactica Flight Simulator", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/RichardHatch?src=hash", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/dKGjzvqI.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/ByCommonConsent/status/829116842673266688", "https://t.co/4qNiywKcv2", "http://www.scifipulse.net/hatch-talks-about-his-new-role-his-future-plans/", "https://twitter.com/nickiclyne/status/829109678365929473", "https://twitter.com/banditloaf/status/829112102300192768", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SSWA?src=hash", "http://www.tmz.com/2017/02/07/battlestar-galactica-star-richard-hatch-dead/", "https://t.co/TukIygJGat", "https://twitter.com/JeffreyVeregge/status/829114875884343296", "http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/richard-hatch-dead-battlestar-galactica-star-captain-apollo-dies-1201980779/", "https://twitter.com/CarolineRhea/status/829113320355614720", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/dKGjzvqI.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/RIP?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/AllMyChildren?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/headgeek666/status/829116618076745729", "https://twitter.com/seanpaune/status/829118035365617665", "https://t.co/Vuoi2hxGF1", "https://twitter.com/LeahCairns/status/829116829951946752", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671011693", "https://twitter.com/RonDMoore/status/829101999220068352"], "published": "2017-02-08T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:10:27.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
