The bans are apparently in response to intelligence reports that terrorists would be disguising bombs as electronics. The US ban affects only foreign carriers, as domestic carriers do not fly to the US directly from the airports in the banned countries. The UK ban affects both domestic and foreign carriers.\n\nThe New York Times reports on the passengers who are going to be inconvenienced by the ban, including researchers travelling to conferences who will be unable to use their laptops in flights lasting over 20 hours to prepare for the conference.\nPassengers are protesting over the prospect of having to fly long hours without the use of their laptops or tablets. Those flying frequently over long distances, such as professional journalists, are going to be the worst affected by the ban. The sudden ban has taken officials from the affected countries by surprise, according to the report .\nBusiness Insider points out that it is unclear how many carriers will be able to work out the logistics of the electronics ban, considering that the ban has a tight schedule of only four days. The ban may actually be at odds with an FAA policy that prohibits transport of electronics in checked in baggage because of the dangers of fires originating from lithium ion batteries, commonly used in consumer electronics. The reasoning behind the ban also remains unclear.\nSo I can't take laptop on a plane. And I won't carry a smartphone because immigration will check it. So we're back to 1995 #electronicsban \n— Azad Essa (@azadessa) March 21, 2017 \n\nAccording to a BBC report, the ban is because of an “evaluated intelligence” report, which indicates that a the US intelligence has intercepted communication, has been directly made aware of a plot by an informer, or the intelligence agencies have found the evidence for a brewing terrorist plot on their own.\nA travel journalist points out in the BBC report that the ban affects British travelers disproportionately because it affects low cost airlines as well, and that passengers who travel light will be forced to use a bag to check in large electronics such as laptops and tablets.\nThe Guardian has statements from security experts who are befuddled by the ban. If the threat is in the use of these devices as a bomb, then the threat applies to the aircraft equally, irrespective of whether it is in the cabin baggage or the checked in baggage. If the perceived threat is over concerns of hacking with the use of laptops, then a smartphone is a portable computer as capable as larger devices, and can be used for the same malicious purposes. The ban serves no tangible purpose, according to the security experts.\nIn fact, the ban may expose the travelers to increased risk, especially those who work with sensitive information on their laptops. Laptops can potentially have unpublished scientific data, rushes of documentary footage, unedited images captured by photojournalists, notes of media workers.\nI'm a journalist who commuted to Istanbul for the last year and a half. The #electronicsban hurts my sources' privacy, my ability to work\n— Molly Crabapple (@mollycrabapple) March 22, 2017 \n\nThe US has banned large electronics on flights form Morocco, Qatar, Kuwait and UAE. UK has banned large electronics on flights from Tunisia and Lebanon. Both countries have banned large electronics from Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The UK has banned phones, laptops and other consumer electronics larger than 16 cm in length, 9.3 cm in width and 1.5 cm in depth. The UK government has indicated that it is coordinating closely with the US government to better understand the threat.\nThe ban applies to only in bound flights. Passengers who want to carry electronics larger than the specified dimensions in flights to the US or UK from these countries will have to do so in the checked in baggage. The devices are not allowed to be carried only in the cabin. UK has indicated that it is working closely with the aviation sector to minimise the impact of the ban on the travelers. Passengers are advised to contact the airlines directly for the limitations and information on enforcement of the ban. UK has not issued any travel advisory discouraging people from travelling to and from the affected countries.\nEmirates, Etihad, Kuwait, Qatar, RAM serve the UK, but are excluded from the UK #electronicsban , included in US ban. https://t.co/QmMcxckXtn pic.twitter.com/wJswAbtNFj \n— Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower) March 21, 2017 \n\nAll laptops, e-readers and tablets are banned in the inbound UK flights, irrespective of their dimensions. The UK ban applies to both foreign and domestic carriers as there are direct inbound flights to the UK by domestic carriers. There are no US carriers with direct inbound flights from the ten international airports in the eight countries banned by the US. While the UK has not commented if the ban is a response to a specific threat, the US has indicated that the ban is not in response to a particular reported threat.\nUsers who are transferring to one of the flights in multi-leg journeys will also be affected by the ban. There is no direct indication from the UK on how long the electronics ban will be in place. An Emirates spokesperson told Reuters that the US ban is in place till 14 October. A spokesperson for the department of homeland security corroborated on the 14 October deadline for the US ban to the Washington Post , and added that the ban could be extended for a year beyond that in case there were no changes in the evaluation of the threat.\nGetting questions like this from frequently flying friends.

Those unable to fly because of the ban or looking for a refund are advised to contact the airlines directly. The UK has asked the airlines to take a customer centrist approach when handling the situation. The bans in both countries affects all passengers on the designated flights, irrespective of their nationalities.\nThe post UK bans large electronics in flights from select countries close on the heels of similar ban in US appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:45:33.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
