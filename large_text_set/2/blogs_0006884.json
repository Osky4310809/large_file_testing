I feel like it's ingrained not only in school, but as a culture.\" \nMary Rizzo, an assistant professor of American studies at Rutgers University -Newark, has studied Baltimore's culture and language. She said \"Baltimorese\" isn't necessarily fading but is static, continuously celebrated and defined by an earlier generation that lived in the 1950s and 1960s. \n\"It was set sort of in stone decades ago. ... I think on some level, 'Bawlmerese' and the way people have spoken for decades has been moving farther and farther apart,\" she said. \nThe influx of younger people moving into the city from out of town could have something to do with Baltimore's language change, Mallinson said, but Baltimoreans aren't going to give up on their linguistic distinctiveness that easily. There's still the open celebration of \"hon\" and the daily use of other popular terms to establish a sense of \"insider familiarity\" with city traditions and culture. \n\"I think folks can keep it alive, just like the Boston accent or the New York accent,\" said Denise Whiting , 57, the owner of Cafe Hon in Hampden. \"It's still there; it's just not as prevalent around this part of town.\" \nWhile HonFest celebrates the culture that spawned Baltimorese, Watkins believes the lingo used in Baltimore's African-American community could use some praise as well. \n\"I think it's interesting, and it's creative and it's colorful, and it's also needed as a coping mechanism for our own survival skills,\" Watkins said, adding that enslaved Africans once used coded language incomprehensible to slave owners to communicate and plan escapes. \n\"The demonization of black people is so prevalent in society that black people in this country really think they don't have an identity or that things they contributed to society aren't relevant â€¦ We don't need to tear it down,\" Watkins said of \"Baldamore's\" unique slang. \"I think we need to celebrate it.\" \nAdds Mallinson: \"People have their opinions about what language means .... From a linguistic perspective, [language differences] are not deficits. Those are not failures. Even at the most simple level, it'd be a very boring place if everybody spoke exactly the same,\" Mallinson said. After all, centuries ago, \"silly\" meant \"happy,\" and \"hussy\" meant \"housewife,\" she added. \n\"Language is always changing and always varying.\" \nA sample of Baltimore lingo \nCompiled by Brittany Britto, John McIntyre \nayo (aye-OH) : interj.
