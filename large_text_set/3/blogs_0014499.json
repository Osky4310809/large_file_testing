A. Animashaun, said the defendants and others at large committed the alleged offence on February 14, 2016 at about 10:30 a.m. at Police College, Ikeja, Lagos. \nHe alleged that they conspired amongst themselves to steal by demanding for property with menace and attempted to extort money. \nAnimashaun also said that the defendants, “with intent to blackmail a man of God, unlawfully demanded the immediate payment of $1million to Otobo by Apostle Johnson Suleiman, the president and founder of Omega Fire Ministry Worldwide, else she would call a press conference and accuse him of committing adultery with her and thereafter kill him.” \nThe court also heard that the defendants with intent to extort money from Suleiman, accused him of committing adultery with Otobo and also promised to marry her. \nAccording to the Animashaun, the offences were punishable under sections 411, 301 and 303 of the Criminal law of Lagos State, 2015. \nThe defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges. \nMagistrate Bukola-Ayeye granted them bail in the sum of N100,000 each which they must deposit with the court’s registrar and two sureties in like sum. \nShe adjourned the case till April 27 for trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:36:27.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
