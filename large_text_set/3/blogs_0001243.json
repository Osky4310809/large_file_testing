But study authors say its future looks bright in that regard, given the U.S. Department of Justice approval of its merger with Virgin America. \nBut for now, Virgin America will have to settle with third place as United Airlines came between the bedfellows for the No.2 slot. \nSpirit limped across the finish line last, finishing at the bottom for on-time arrivals, customer satisfaction, cabin comfort and frequent flyer programs. \nAlthough Frontier was ranked above Spirit, the Denver-based ultra-low-airline came in last for lost baggage, and for fees for baggage and itinerary changes. \nFrontier spokesman Jim Faulkner said the airline has been taking steps to improve various services, including technical issues and automation in the bag room, how it responds to bad weather events and how it monitors plane taxiing and gate waits so the airline can react more quickly. \nThe airline has also added two new services — the Works and the Perks — that allow flyers to bundle costs, such as seat selection, carry-on bags and checked bags. \n“Internally, we’ve actually seen complaints come down in the month of February,” Faulkner said, “which is good news.” \nUnsurprisingly, the two ultra-low-cost carriers finished ahead of the pack on airfare, Spirit being the cheapest followed by Frontier.
