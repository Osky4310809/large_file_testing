By Jeffrey Matulef Published 24/01/2017 \nSplendid satirist group Tomorrow Corporation will be releasing its entire library on Nintendo Switch upon the console's 3rd March launch. \nThis includes World of Goo , Little Inferno and Human Resource Machine . \nFor the uninitiated, World of Goo is a physics-based puzzler about building towers and bridges out of gelatinous critters, Little Inferno is an avant garde affair about a child ordering goods only to burn them in a fireplace in order to stay warm, and Human Resource Machine is puzzle game about programming and productivity in an uncaring corporate machine. \nFor the first time, each game will come bundled with their original soundtracks by Kyle Gabler. And what soundtracks these are! As you can hear in the Little Inferno trailer below, these are practically worth the price of admission alone. \nExclusive to Switch will be a Soundtrack Mode, \"where players can explore Kyle Gabler's wonderfully bizarre music in this special mode, available only on Nintendo Switch.\" Perhaps that means you'll be able to mix and match tunes? \nThe appearance of Tomorrow Corporation's vault on Nintendo Switch shouldn't come as a surprise given that World of Goo was released on Wii, while Little Inferno was the rare Wii U launch title. Human Resource Machine likewise appeared on Wii U upon its 2015 release. All three titles are well worth checking out.
