Shilton February 6, 2017 Shutterstock Your Privacy Rights Canadian Customers \nIf needing a cookie turns you into a literal monster, you may suffer from a condition called “hanger.” \nFor the uninitiated, hanger (that’s the amalgamation of “hunger” and “anger”) is when an empty stomach sours your disposition, often resulting in irritability, mood swings, and unintentionally shouting something regrettable at your spouse.

Glucose is your brain’s preferred fuel. When your brain senses that glucose supplies are running low, you start wigging out. \nThis is why having a snack instantly cures hanger (though your marriage may be harder to fix). Eating food begins the glucose restoration process in your body. \nSuffering from the occasion bout of hanger is normal, but getting hangry on daily basis is not, says Catherine Shanahan, M.D., director of the Los Angeles Lakers PRO Nutrition Program, and author of Deep Nutrition . \n“Daily hanger could mean you have a metabolic problem,” she says. “It shouldn’t be that difficult for your body to provide your brain with energy.” \nIf you suffer from frequently recurring hanger, your brain may actually be suffering from a sugar addiction, Shanahan says. (Take this quiz to find out if you’re hooked on the sweet stuff.) The more simple carbohydrates (sugar, processed grain products) you eat, the more your body craves them as fuel. \nBut your body should run on a variety of fuels for the greatest efficiency, says Shanahan. The \"you rest, you rust\" adage applies to almost every aspect of your body—metabolism included, she says. \nShanahan advocates for restricting carbs every now and as a way to spur “fat adaptation,” or the metabolizing of fat. “The more you require fat for fuel, the more your body begins to make the enzymes required to break fat down,” she says.

Eating a bowl of Lucky Charms or tearing into a cinnamon roll is like mainlining pure glucose. Worse, it sets you up for a day of carb-dependence. Swap the sugary cereal for eggs scrambled with veggies and you’ll start your day burning fat and protein first—and drastically lower your risk of hanger. \nAnd keep sugary snacks to a minimum throughout the day. Instead, try peanut butter and a banana, or cheese and crackers—options that have some carbohydrates but also contain fat and protein, which slow digestion and help keep blood sugar stable. \nFinally, Bevins says that one of the keys to addressing “hanger” is learning to realize when you’re legitimately mad and when your brain is tricking you into feeling pissed. If your stormy mood could be the latter, resist the urge to bite your spouse’s head off. Instead, reserve that bite for some beef jerky. \nYour stomach, brain, and loved ones will thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:29:17.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
