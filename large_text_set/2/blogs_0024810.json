Witches Worldwide Are Planning To Cast A Spell On Donald Trump On February 24th. Let’s Join ‘em!! XX https://t.co/uKGWwix4ee — Elvira (@TheRealElvira) February 24, 2017 \nThe spell, which is described by witches as a \"binding spell,\" is not intended to harm the president, but rather to restrain him and to prevent him from doing anything policy wise or to harm anyone. The first binding spell ritual was cast at midnight on Friday, and others are scheduled for March 26, April 24 and May 23. \nPerforming the spell involves an elaborate set-up including a tarot card, a picture of Trump, a carrot, and a bowl of water, among other things. Apparently, laughing at Trump is also quite effective for the spell to work. A Facebook group for the \"Bind Trump\" movement has over 11,000 followers. \nTo counteract the witches and to protect the president, a group of Christians are planning a day of prayer. \nWhat interesting times we live in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:48:15.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
