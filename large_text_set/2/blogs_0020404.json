We will adjust some things, they will adjust some things but we have to score goals. If we don't score a goal in Monaco we will be eliminated. \n“Of course I am happier than my colleague from Monaco but at 2-0 (two behind) we are out. And if one team can score a thousand million goals it's Monaco.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:48:55.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
