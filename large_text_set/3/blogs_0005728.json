However, one notable exception was the Korean giant Samsung, which only launched a tablet and a 2-in-1 in the form of the Galaxy Tab S3 and Galaxy Book, but didn’t launch any new smartphone. Its upcoming flagship, the Galaxy S8 (related read: what to expect from the Samsung Galaxy S8 ) is still a few weeks away. But that doesn’t mean that the Chaebol didn’t have anything to show in its booth, as it was there we spotted the latest handsets in the A series, the A3 (2017) and A5 (2017) . Here are our initial impressions about the mid-ranger duo from Samsung’s stable. \nThe first thing that would catch your attention is that 2017’s Galaxy A3 and A5 are quite different from their predecessors design wise. In fact, they bear close resemblance to Samsung’s current flagship, the Galaxy S7 ( review ). You get metallic frames with curved rears sporting glass finishes, lending them an upmarket feel. In fact, you might mistake the larger of the two, the Galaxy A5 (2017) for the Galaxy S7 because of the similar dimensions. The fascia sports similar design ethos with the home button doubling up as a fingerprint scanner, and the placement of ports and buttons is also almost the same. Additionally, both phones are IP68 rated, making them dust- and waterproof. \nSamsung is aiming at one-hand usage with these smartphones, since the Galaxy A3 (2017) is built around a small screen measuring 4.7-inches. The Galaxy A5 (2017) is larger in comparison, yet remains smaller than the current trend of phablets with its display spanning 5.2-inches. We were able to use both of them single-handedly with ease, though the glass panels do make them quite slippery. The handsets are available in multiple colours such as gold, black, pink, and blue. Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) and A5 (2017) design gallery 1 of 8 \nIn terms of the screen resolution, the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) features HD resolution, which combined with its display of 4.7-inches, results in Retina display-class pixel density of 312ppi. The bigger sibling comes with full HD resolution to offer sharp text on the 5.2-inch screen. Thanks to the use of Super AMOLED tech, the smartphones offer impressive colour reproduction. Similar to the Galaxy S7, you also get the always-on display feature. The devices also get a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 4 as a protective layer. \nUnder the hood, both Galaxy A3 (2017) and A5 (2017) come powered by Samsung’s Exynos chipsets. The smaller sibling features Exynos 7870 SoC offering eight cores running at 1.6GHz, whereas the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) is equipped with slightly more powerful 1.9GHz Exynos 7880 octa-core processor. The same trend continues in the RAM and storage department, as the A3 (2017) gets 2GB RAM and 16GB flash memory, while the A5 (2017) has 3GB RAM and 32GB in-built memory on offer. The mobiles support memory expansion with the use of microSD cards, although you’d need to forgo the dual-SIM functionality as the phones come with hybrid secondary slots. \nTalking about cameras, the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) sports a 13-meg shooter at the back and a 5MP snapper at the front for selfies. The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) on the other hand, is quite powerful in this aspect as it flaunts 16-megapixel sensors at the back as well as on the front. The cameras feature a wide aperture of f/1.9 which means it should be able to capture more light even in dim settings. For illumination in poorly-lit conditions, the rear shooters get assistance from LED flash units, while the selfie camera can make use of the screen flash. \nBoth smartphones come with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which, similar to Samsung’s recent phones, is devoid of any bloatware. You only get Microsoft apps preloaded, though you do get useful features such as Ultra Power Saving mode. Juicing up the Galaxy A3 (2017) is a 2,350mAh battery, whereas the bigger sibling draws power from a larger 3,000mAh unit. \nWhile the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) may not come to India at all or might come at a later date, the company has just announced the launch of the A5 (2017) and A7 (2017) in the country.The new A5 is priced at Rs 28,990, while the A7 (2017) will set you back by Rs 33,490. The phones look interesting for sure and it’s great that Samsung has managed to make them impervious to water. It’d be interesting to see how well they’re accepted in the Indian market. \nPhotos by Ketaki Bhojnagarwala", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:53:37.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
