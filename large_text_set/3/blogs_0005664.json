You can tell by the way Japan is going nuts for cherry blossom-flavored everything. But while everyone loves cherry blossoms, where’s the love for cherries? Right here. And it sounds like an absolutely delicious offering. It’s cherry soda and a special cherry float straight out of McDonald’s Japan. My mouth is already craving the sweet, smooth cherry taste that I know will probably taste like Cherry Sprite, but I want it anyway.\nBeginning this week McDonald’s Japan is going to start selling the McFizz Sakuranbo and the McFloat Sakuranbo . “Sakuranbo” is the word for cherry, so it makes sense that they’re named as such. Both will come in adorable cherry cups with flowers and cherries on them, and you can see straight through to the pink liquid inside. If you opt for the McFizz Sakuranbo, you’ll essentially get a pink-hued cherry soda. If you go for the McFloat Sakuranbo, you get a dollop of soft serve vanilla ice cream on top. I’m not sure how well the vanilla ice cream actually goes with cherry syrup and Sprite, but it could be an interesting mix. Big Red and vanilla ice cream seem to work together just fine, so it might make sense.\nvia japantrends.com\nI’m already ready to pack my bags for an impromptu trip to Japan even though I could very easily remake this here in the States, but that packaging really has me interested in hopping a plane. The beverages are going on sale on March 8 and will be available throughout early April to go along with the whole cherry blossom season in Japan. The McFizz is only one of the several McDonalds world items that have me envious. Nothing’s more refreshing than a “spritzer” type beverage with fruity flavors, and this seems to fit the bill nicely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T15:36:18.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
