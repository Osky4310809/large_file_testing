Steven Bear was confronted by Dakota on Celebs Go Dating (Photo: E4) Dakota told Bear exactly what she thought of him (Photo: E4) \n“Shut the f**k up. You done a runner,\" she fumed. \n\"I asked for Will Smith and got a f g hobbit.” \nShe added: “You’re an attention seeking beg. Everyone expected you to do it. Have a good night little man.” Dakota didn't hold back (Photo: E4) \nDakota then stormed off as Bear sat alone without a date for the rest of the speed dating evening. \nAnd fans weren't impressed with Bear's actions. \nLast week, Bear lost the respect of the viewers when he ran out on Dakota just eight minutes into their date, sending a note for her saying he'd left a chicken in the oven - and leaving her with a bill for the food he ordered. \nHe then went on his second date with 'Blue Lips', a name he has for a woman called Stacey because he can't remember her name and she wears blue lipstick. Stephen Bear en route to his second date (Photo: E4) \nWell, he was meant to be going on his second date. \nHe had already swiftly ended their first, not actually telling her he was leaving and ditching her in a pub on her own. \nFor some reason, she decided to give him a second chance and agreed to meet up with him again. She soon regretted it... (Photo: E4) \nBut in the taxi on the way to the restaurant, he claimed he was going to really try to leave his 'Bear' character at home and be the real Stephen. \nThen he appeared to get cold feet, saying he couldn't do it and jumping out of the taxi, leaving Stacey sitting on her own in the restaurant for over an hour. Poor Blue Lips was left on her own (Photo: E4) \nStacey eventually realised what was happening and called the dating agency to let Nadia Essex know she'd been stood up. \nOne Twitter user didn't mince his words, saying: \"What a disgusting piece of sh** Bear is. Leaving that poor girl high and dry. What a pr***.\" \nAnother young woman commented: \"I take it back what he did was f***ing awful. Who the hell does he think he is to do that to women.\" \nOne said she hated Bear, adding: \"His attitude to women is f***ing atrocious!! That poor girl how humiliating!!\" \n* Celebs Go Dating continues on E4 at 10pm Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:28:48.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
