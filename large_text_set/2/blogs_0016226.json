Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nRoyston Drenthe , the Dutchman who became notorious for leading a rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle when he played for Real Madrid and Everton , has quit football – to pursue a career as a rapper. \nThe party-loving 29-year-old hasn’t kicked a ball in anger since walking out on Abu Dhabi-based Baniyas over a pay dispute last summer. \nBut he insists he has now turned his back on the game for good as he looks to take on Drake, Jay Z and Kanye West at the top of the Hip Hop charts. \nDrenthe has adopted the stage name ‘Roya2faces’ and his first single – called ‘Paranoia’ – is ready to be released. Drenthe playing for Reading (Photo: Ben Hoskins) Jose Mourinho was not best impressed with the Dutchman (Photo: Getty) \nThe track namechecks Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Jaap Stam. \nAnd Drenthe’s warning that he will continue to use his experiences in football to express himself in his new vocation might even catch the ear of Jose Mourinho. \nDrenthe fell out spectacularly with the Manchester United boss when he played under him at Madrid. \nAfter becoming angry with the winger’s poor discipline, Mourinho packed him off on-loan to Hercules, who were struggling at the bottom of La Liga. It didn’t go well. Drenthe explained: “Mourinho was a bit p***ed off when I came back to Real. https://www.instagram.com/p/BQMK2hhj5KZ/embed \n“Hercules did not pay my wages and I went on strike. But Mourinho said I should have represented Real Madrid much better. \n“I tried to become a star in Madrid and people should have respect for me because I tried. But Mourinho made me out to be a difficult guy. \n“I did not have a good relationship with him, but he forgets that I was not getting my wages at the loan club.” \nYet when Drenthe moved to the Bernabeu from Feyenoord in 2007 for £11million, he was regarded as one of the hottest young talents in football. https://www.instagram.com/p/BQLS6f8jjZv/embed \nReal allowed him to join Everton in 2011 on a 12-month loan deal, but he was left out of the Toffees’ FA Cup semi-final squad to face Liverpool and told to stay away from the club after repeatedly turning up late for training. \nDrenthe later blamed David Moyes’ failure to understand that he was suffering from anxiety attacks. \nAfter spending a year in Russia with Spartak Vladikavkaz, the Dutchman then returned to England with Reading in 2013 – only for the Royals to send him to Sheffield Wednesday on loan. \nHis downfall continued with a short stint in Turkey before his ill-fated move to the Middle East. \nHe said: “I have ended my career. I am no longer a footballer. I am fed up with all the stuff in the football world.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:43:45.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
