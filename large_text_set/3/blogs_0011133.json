London was 39th last year but was nudged down one place in the latest rankings by the French city of Lyon. \nKate Fitzpatrick, Mercer’s global mobility practice leader for the UK & Ireland said: \"The capital’s only downfall in regard to infrastructure is heavy traffic congestion, which also contributes to the city’s low score for air quality and pollution.\" \nLondon was five places ahead of Edinburgh – the only other British city to make the top 50. \nMs Fitzpatrick said Brexit could also have an impact on London's position in the rankings in future. \n“Mercer will continue to closely monitor any impact of the upcoming Brexit negotiations on the quality of living in UK and European cities overall, in order to support multinational companies as they assess the best locations to attract the skilled workforce they require,\" she said.

'Two in three Londoners would quit capital over air pollution' \nIn January, air pollution in London reached a six year high when a “black” alert was issued for parts of the capital leading to one school restricting time outdoors for children. \nLast month, a report commissioned by the mayor revealed that tens of thousands of children in London schools are being exposed to illegal levels of air pollution. \nThe report also showed that London’s poor are far more likely to be living in areas affected by air pollution linked to 9,000 early deaths every year in the capital. \nLondon is one of many places hit by the UK’s air quality crisis, which has led to the Government being issued with a “final warning” by the European Commission for repeated breaches of legal limits. \nVienna in Austria beat 231 other cities to claim the top spot in the study. Baghdad was handed the lowest ranking. \nThe German citiies of Dusseldorf, Munich and Frankfurt all made the top ten. \nDestinations from further afield that made the cut include Auckland, Vancouver, Zurich and Sydney.
