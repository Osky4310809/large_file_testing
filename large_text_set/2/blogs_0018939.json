Now, six years later, Broke L.A. — which officially announces its lineup today — has a different name, and for the first time this year, a slightly different approach. \nCalling their popular event a “true discovery fest,” Broke L.A. organizers say they are \"doubling down\" on showcasing local talent in addition to supplying an affordable festival alternative. Case in point: Starting this year, Broke L.A. will no longer go head-to-head with Coachella. This year’s Broke L.A. festivities are scheduled for April 8, a week before Coachella begins. Organizers say they hope holding the event on a separate weekend will attract more members of the music industry to see the up-and-coming acts they have booked. The change will also allow artists to play at Broke L.A. and at any of the myriad parties and showcases surrounding Coachella. \n\"We [were] making our artists and the people who could help them in their career choose between us and Coachella, and that was not really fair,” says Negin Singh, artistic director at cARTel: Collaborative Arts L.A. , the main organization producing the festival. \"We feel strong enough about who we are that we can have our own weekend, and we don’t have to be tied to Coachella.\" \nThe festival is co-produced by Brownies and Lemonade, Shifty Rhythms and Department 4. \nAnother change: This year’s event will be held at 4560 Worth Street, an empty lot in East L.A. — a bit of a switch-up for the festival, which has largely become associated with downtown L.A. and the Arts District. CARTel projects this year’s attendance could reach between 7,500 and 10,000, a significant bump from last year’s 5,500-strong crowd. \nThis year’s indie-pop and electronic-leaning lineup is topped by headliner James Supercave, the buzzy Echo Park psychedelic pop band and KCRW favorite. \nOther acts spread across the four music stages include heavy surf-pop act Bloodboy, spacey troubadours Boyo (who earlier this year we acknowledged as a band to watch in 2017 ), funk-punk band Thumpasaurus, indie electronic producer CRNKN, San Diego rapper John Givez and many more. (Check out the full lineup below.) \nThe event is acknowledgement “that the scene is here, and we wouldn’t be here without it, and there’s a lot of talent [in L.A.] that doesnt get the proper recognition they deserve,” says Patrick Logothetti of James Supercave. “A lot of people who can’t afford going to a Beyonce show at the Staples Center can still be part of great, vibrant art.\" Related Stories Brownies and Lemonade Books Unknown DJs and Still Packs in the Party Kids \nLike last year, the festival also features a dedicated comedy stage, headlined by Kyle Kinane and curated by local comedians Omid Singh and Robbie Kirkhuff and producer Chelsea Quinn, as well as a dog adoption event called Bark L.A. and a civic engagement project called Same Sky. \nThe festival is taking a slightly different approach to music programming this year, too, doing away with the genre-specific stages in favor of a more eclectic experience. \"The stages will still have feels to them — it won’t be jarring — but you wil see diversity, and a story being told about the musc scene in general,” says Singh. \nSingh says this year's festival will also put a significant focus on art installations, including a “whimsical playground buildout” for each of the five stages. \nAs for the future of Broke L.A., Singh says she foresees a time when the festival will stop growing — she says the idea isn’t to become another major L.A.-based festival. (She cites FYF, which like Broke L.A. started small but ballooned into a major fest, as an example of what cARTel doesn’t want to do.) Instead — depending on how this year’s fest turns out — she says cARTel is considering expanding the event to other cities. \n“We want to keep that discovery [theme], so we do see there being a cap for audience growth — sticking around where we are right now, with maybe a little more growth,” says Singh. “But our eventual goal is to possibly launch Broke in different cities — Broke New York, Broke Austin, Broke San Francisco, and really being able to celebrate and cultivate and give a platform to artists in those cities the way we have in L.A.\" \nComplete lineup below.
