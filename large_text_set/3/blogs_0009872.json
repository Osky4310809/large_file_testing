Here's where things stand through 54 holes at Innisbrook. \nLeaderboard: Hadwin (-14), Patrick Cantlay (-10), Jim Herman (-9), Dominic Bozzelli (-8), J.J. Henry (-7), Henrik Stenson (-7), Charl Schwartzel (-6), Lucas Glover (-6) \nWhat it means: Hadwin is 18 holes from his first PGA Tour victory. A two-time Web.com Tour winner in 2014, Hadwin posted his best PGA Tour finish this past January when he fired a third-round 59 en route to a runner-up at the CareerBuilder Challenge . A win would make him the second Canadian champion of the season, following Mackenzie Hughes at the RSM Classic . Hadwin will be chased on Sunday by Cantlay, the former top-ranked amateur looking to live up to his massive potential after a lengthy battle with a bad back and the tragic death of his caddie and friend, Chris Roth. \nRound of the day: Cantlay birdied his first hole, his last hole, and three more in between for a bogey-free, 5-under 66. His key to success? Finding 12 of 13 fairways on the demanding Copperhead Course. \nBest of the rest: Hadwin, Henry and Schwartzel, the defending champion, all carded 67s. Like Cantlay, Hadwin was mistake-free. His 4-under round has him four clear of the field with 18 holes to play. \nBiggest disappointment: Stenson started the day 7 under, and finished it 7 under. The champion golfer of the year made a birdie and bogey on each nine to drop from three to seven off the pace. \nShot of the day: Hadwin will enter the final round four ahead thanks to his fourth and final birdie of the day, courtesy of this 55-foot make at the par-3 15th: Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:39:26.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
