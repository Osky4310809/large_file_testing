The new Trump administration has made clear its intolerance toward what it sees as “free riders” on defence.\nThe speculation is that Morneau will achieve this by a combination of methods.\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images A Changeling shapeshifting infiltrator is shown in Ottawa while in the human form of Canadian finance minister Bill Morneau. Firstly, he will shovel existing spending such as the $1 billion or so spent on the Canadian Coast-Guard into the defence envelope, as well as some costs associated with the Canada Border Services Agency.\nThe second move is likely to cause indigestion for many progressive Liberals. Sources suggest that a proposal to sign on to the U.S. ballistic missile defence program was sent to Cabinet last week.\nThere is no word on whether it was approved but if it was, the spending implications could show up in the budget, with details to follow in the Defence Policy Review that is sitting on the desk of minister Harjit Sajjan.\nThe move to join BMD would be a significant policy reversal for a Liberal government. Paul Martin’s foreign minister, Pierre Pettigrew, announced that Canada would not be joining President George W. Bush’s BMD program 12 years ago.\nTHIERRY CHARLIER/AFP/Getty Images U.S. Secretary of Defence James Mattis talks to Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan ahead of a NATO Defence Ministers' meeting in Brussels on Feb. 16, 2017. There were concerns that the “Star Wars” system would “weaponize space”, even though interceptors were, and are, ground or ship based.\nBut the hysteria around Canada losing its foreign policy independence meant more than half of Canadians opposed BMD, alarmed that the nuclear codes were in the hands of reckless, ruthless, uninformed maverick.\nClearly, none of those concerns apply today…\nRegardless of his reservations privately, the Prime Minister has made it his mission to accommodate President Donald Trump and in their first meeting in Washington last month, they dropped hints that BMD might be part the deal.\nThe joint statement from the two leaders said both countries want to “modernize and broaden our NORAD partnership”, as well as relations in cyber and space.\nMANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images Donald Trump greets Justin Trudeau at the White House. The foundations have been laid — by civility and flattery — upon which a constructive rapport can be built, John Ivison writes. As the Senate defence committee found in its report on BMD two years ago, the decision not to participate has harmed Canada’s position in the continental defence organization, NORAD. The decision on when, where and whether to intercept an incoming missile is not made under the NORAD structure but, rather, by the U.S. alone under its domestic defence body, United States Northern Command. If a missile is heading towards Calgary, the Canadian military representative at NORAD has to leave the room while those decisions are made.\nAs the committee said in its unanimous recommendation to partner with the U.S. on BMD: “Canada cannot simply assume that all its territory will be protected by default under the existing U.S. BMD system.”\nExpert testimony from Lt. Gen. Alain Parent said the threat from North Korea, Iran and others is real. The committee concluded it’s time Canada join 27 other nations, including NATO partners, Australia, Japan and South Korea in BMD, allowing Canadian officials to be at the table when decisions are made.\nRelated Top Defence bureaucrat jumps to firm that’s part of group awarded multi-billion dollar military contract Trump’s first budget will hike defence spending by $54 billion and make big cuts to foreign aid: White House Lawrence Solomon: Canada ’s one of NATO ’s biggest deadbeats, but with Trump, we won’t get away with it anymore As Dalhousie University professor of international relations, Frank Harvey, told the senators, Canada has already endorsed the logic, strategic utility and security imperatives underpinning BMD.\n“In essence, the government of Canada fully embraces the merits of multi-national co-operation on missile defence, as part of Canada’s treaty obligations and alliance commitments,” he said.\nThe cost implications are not clear and Canada’s contribution may be more technical, such as supplying additional radar tracking stations.\nBut Morneau had best hope there are some.\nIn the upside down economics of the Trump era, he needs to find ways to spend a lot more money on defence and a lot less of virtually everything else.\n• Email: jivison@nationalpost.com | Twitter: IvisonJ \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:27:33.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
