She is taking legal action against Capital & Coast DHB, for failing to prevent her son's death by suspected suicide. \nThe mother of a mental health patient who died of suspected suicide is suing Wellington's health board for depriving him of his right to life. \nLyn Copland's son Samuel Fischer died in April 2015, in Wellington's secure mental health unit, where he was placed for his own safety. His was only the second death inside the unit in 20 years. \nCopland filed papers at Wellington's High Court on Monday, claiming $100,000 in compensation for Capital & Coast District Health Board's failure to prevent the death of her son. KEVIN STENT/FAIRFAX NZ \nSam Fischer died of suspected suicide in 2015, in Capital & Coast's acute mental health unit where he had been admitted for his own safety. \nShe is claiming the DHB breached Fischer's right not to be deprived of life, as enshrined in the Bill of Rights Act. \nREAD MORE \nThe unusual \"right to life\" claim is a novel approach to getting around ACC legislation, which prevents people suing for personal injury. KEVIN STENT/FAIRFAX NZ \nNothing will bring back her son, but Copland is determined to fight to the bitter end to improve the mental health system for others. \nCopland brought photos of Sam to court, so he could be there for the big day. But she felt no joy – \"I just want him back\". She was taking the legal action in the hope of improving the mental health system for others and hoped Health Minister Jonathan Coleman would take notice. \n\"This is what Sam would have wanted. He was wanting things to be better. That is his legacy. I'm taking this to the bitter end, for the love of Sam.\" \nCopland's barrister, Richard Francois, said the case was about accountability. In 2014, there were 139 suspected suicides of mental health patients, of which 131 were in the community, 6 in inpatient units and 2 on approved leave. Ross Giblin \nLyn Copland with tireless advocate Robert Miller (left) and barrister Richard Francois, as they file their claim at Wellington's High Court. \n\"So many psych patients are dying in the care of the state. And the state just says either, 'We're sorry' or 'We couldn't have really done much more'. They just weasel their way out of it.\" Ad Feedback \nIf successful, the principle could be extended to prisoners who committed suicide and potentially even the families of those killed by mental health patients under state care, Francois said. \nThe statement of claim argued Capital & Coast ought to have known Fischer was at \"real and immediate risk\" of committing suicide and that it failed in its obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent that happening. KEVIN STENT/ FAIRFAX NZ \nCopland sits at the spot on her property at Akatarawa where Sam wrote music and played the conch. \nThe claim also alleged the DHB increased Fischer's anxiety and distress through shame, seclusion and failing to prevent him racking up a $20,000 credit card debt. \nA review of Fischer's death previously found doctors ignored his long history of suicide attempts: \"The risk of attempted suicide should have been a prominent feature in his management planning because of his many past attempts and current instability,\" the reviewers concluded. \nAfter Fischer's death, Capital & Coast denied he had previously attempted suicide in the inpatient unit. However, The Dominion Post revealed two separate incident reports, documenting \"self-harm\" and \"suicidal behaviour\". \nCopland's statement of claim goes further, alleging three incidents of suicidal behaviour and numerous suicide threats, in the weeks leading to Fischer's death. \nCapital & Coast DHB said it could not comment on Copland's claims as it was not yet aware of any legal action. \nCopland has already won a Privacy Commission complaint, after Capital & Coast boss Debbie Chin sent an email to the board's 3200 staff discussing Fischer's death and attacking Copland's reputation. \nThe Mental Health Commissioner is also investigating Fischer's care. \nCopland's legal action comes amid mounting nationwide concerns about the state of the mental health system. A January review of Wellington's mental health services – sparked by a spate of killings by mental health patients – revealed the \"stretched\" mental health system was not coping. \nMental health workers followed up with an open letter, saying the system was \"in crisis\", and calling on Coleman to \"fix it\". Coleman acknowledged growing demand on mental health services but denied the system was in crisis. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:15:42.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
