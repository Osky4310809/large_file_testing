And while the Saints were down to 10 men, Steven Davis brought down Dele Alli in the box and the England midfielder converted the penalty. Saints had a strong shout for a spot-kick of their own in first-half injury time when Ben Davies clattered Dusan Tadic. \nEFL Cup finalists Southampton, who were laying only their third game in five weeks, hit back after 52 minutes when James Ward-Prowse converted Ryan Bertrand's cross at the far post. Eriksen after scoring (Photo: REUTERS) 1. Tottenham are not a one-man team \nInjured Harry Kane has scored 24 goals this season – but Dele Alli is fast catching up. The England midfielder won the first-half penalty and netted his 17th of the season for his club – and for the fourth game in a row. Christian Eriksen scored his 10th of the campaign while Son Heung-min worked tirelessly up front. \nWhen the Korean was replaced after 74 minutes, Alli was pushed forward into the striking role – leaving £17m summer signing Vincent Janssen on the bench until the 86th minute. \nSpurs will need to conintue this team effort until Kane, who damaged his ankle against Millwall last week, returns next month.

Southampton are leakier than a broken colander \nJose Fonte was flogged to West Ham on January 20 after failing to agee a new contract – and Virgil Van Dijk was injured two days later to rob Saints of their two best centre-backs. In the seven games since Claude Puel's side won at Anfield to reach the EFL Cup final, they have conceded 18 goals. They are great to watch – they have scored 13 in the same games – but need to tighten up. It is hard to win at White Hart Lane when you give Spurs a two-goal headstart.

Spurs are not soft touches anymore \nSouthampton were the better team in the first 15 minutes as they fizzed the ball about with some slick passing. Mauricio Pochettino's team were not having it. Eric Dier flattened Dusan Tadic before the England defender was was booked for a crunching foul on Nathan Redmond. Kyle Walker also saw a yellow card for a naughty late challenge on Ryan Bertrand – and Victor Wanyama took out Tadci after the break. Pochettino, a former Argentina defender, has fashioned a team in his own uncompromising image.

Saints missed Manolo Gabbiadini \nThe Italian striker had enjoyed a ridiculous start to his Southampton career, scoring six goals in his first four matches, including a brace in the in EFL Cup final. He started sharply today and after 28 minutes he exchanged passes with Dusan Tadic before firing into the sidenetting. But he appeared to damage his groin in the act of shooting and limped off to be replaced by Shane Long. Southampton were not the same again. (Photo: REUTERS) 5. There were seven England squad players on the pitch but Oriol Romeu was the best out there \nWith Kane out injured, Gareth Southgate picked more Saints players – Fraser Forster, Ryan Bertrand, Nathan Redmond and James Ward-Prowse – than Tottenham (Kyle Walker, Eric Dier and Dele Alli). But the standout player was Romeu, who contested a fiery midfield battle with former Saint Victor Wanyama but also distributed the ball well and had the energy to burst forward. The ex-Barcelona and Chelsea playmaker is now the heartbeat of this Southampton side.
