I want to make sure it’s even worth it. I don’t want to just sit there up there like ‘I’m in the media, look our people are there…'” he continued. “But there is investigative journalism, or people to interview in DC.

Jones also claimed that he personally received a phone call from the president following the election. \nWatch above, via YouTube.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T18:35:56.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
