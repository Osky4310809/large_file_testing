I know how difficult it is to find top goalscorers. I would like him to stay but I don’t know what is going to happen. Even in my career I didn’t know what would happen at the end of the season. I was clear every time we spoke with Sergio from the beginning. I know his strengths.” Aguero may have 18 goals in 26 appearances in all competitions so far this season, but that apparently is only good for fourth choice at Manchester City these days. “Sergio knows the intention of his manager and the club. I don’t want to sell him. I want him to stay here for a long time until he decides. The reason he’s not played the last two games are because Leroy, Gabriel and Raheem have played amazing. That’s the only reason why. If I can change the model and play all four … But I am a guy who likes to play midfield players to have more control. What I feel now is that if Leroy, Gabriel or Raheem don’t play, then he will be in for them.” -Pep Guardiola; source: Guardian Chelsea and PSG are just two of the teams who have been linked so far , though if the 28-year-old with the dodgy hamstrings and the five-second angrys is truly looking to leave, there’s no doubt that many more teams would be interested. While Chelsea could probably spend more wisely if we do need to replace Diego Costa after this season (Lukaku!), the Aguero situation will be worth keeping an eye on just in case he becomes available at a discount.
