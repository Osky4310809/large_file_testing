Jerry Knowles wants to put a stop to the sanctuary campus movement in his state as soon as he and his legislative colleagues get back to work in January.\nHe circulated a co-sponsorship memo in December in an effort to find like-minded lawmakers to help push a bill that would cut off state funding to any institution of higher education that sets itself up as a “sanctuary campus” to protect illegal immigrants.\nKnowles’ memo followed by only a few days the news that two Pennsylvania schools — Swarthmore College and the University of Pennsylvania — had pledged to refuse to allow federal authorities on campus without a warrant. They directed their campus law enforcement not to communicate, coordinate or cooperate with federal authorities regarding undocumented individuals on campus and refuse to share information about undocumented students with federal agencies unless presented with some form of legal process.\nIn other words, Swarthmore and Penn administrators are setting their schools up as sanctuary campuses.\nThat is an attitude that Knowles finds abhorrent.\n“By declaring themselves ‘Sanctuary Campuses,’ these institutions of higher learning are blatantly disregarding federal law, thumbing their noses at the taxpayers of Pennsylvania,” Knowles said . “Turning a blind eye to the issue of illegal immigrants on campuses for the sake of making some kind of political statement on this nation’s immigration policy is unconscionable.”\nThomas E. Spock, chairman of the Swarthmore Board of Managers, and Valerie Smith, president of Swarthmore, issued a statement in which they claimed the school had no choice but to go sanctuary, given President-elect Trump’s anti-DACA attitude.\n“Swarthmore College supports the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and urges its continuation in the next administration,” Spock and Smith wrote. “Accordingly, we reaffirm our commitment to ensure that undocumented and DACA students continue to be admitted without regard to their financial status and continue to have full access to financial aid.”\nThe three top administrators at the University of Pennsylvania threw down a similar gauntlet in late November.\n“Let us be unequivocally clear: We are and remain resolute in our commitment to Penn’s undocumented students, and will do all that we can to ensure their continued safety and success here at Penn,” read a statement signed by Penn President Amy Gutmann, Provost Vincent Price and Executive VP Craig R. Carnaroli.\nThis is not just a Pennsylvania issue. The Associated Press reported the president of the Southern Illinois University system had promised to explore the idea of setting SIU up as a sanctuary campus.\nThe Texas Tribune reported students are circulating petitions at Texas State, the University of Texas at Austin and University of North Texas asking their administrators to “guarantee students privacy by refusing to release information regarding the immigration status of students, staff, and/or university community members.”\n politics/2017/01/01/pennsylvania-republican-vows-to-hit-sanctuary-campuses-where-it-hurts/\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.texastribune.org/2016/12/01/abbott-vows-cut-funding-sanctuary-campus-schools/", "http://www.repknowles.com/NewsItem.aspx?NewsID=265471", "http://www.swarthmore.edu/news-events/swarthmore-board-pledges-sanctuary-undocumented-students-all-community-members", "https://news.upenn.edu/message-penn-community-concerning-our-daca-and-undocumented-community-members", "http://www.theprogressnews.com/news/state/student-government-make-siu-a-sanctuary-for-immigrants/article_a35a24e6-a6b6-5f4c-bbaa-4a69c6a682c2.html"], "published": "2017-01-02T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T04:46:23.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
