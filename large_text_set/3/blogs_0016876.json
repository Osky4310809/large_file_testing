Dungey, meanwhile, had to go through to the Semi after Chad Reed just edged him out for fourth place in the heat race. Dungey made it into a Main with a second-place finish behind Justin Brayton in the Semi. \nDungey was able to get off to a good start in the Main, finding himself behind Baguette and Tomac. Baggett eventually faded behind the two championship rivals, but only lost third to Marvin Musquin during the middle of the race when he made a mistake. Musquin then ran down his teammate and passed Dungey for second in the closing stages, costing Dungey two more points in his championship fight. Cole Seely rounded out the top five on his HRC Honda after passing Chad Reed, who spent most of the Main event without a visor after it fell off early in the race. \nMeanwhile in the 250SX class, Zach Osborne extended his points lead after an aggressive pass mid-race on championship rival Joey Savatgy. \nDespite going down in his heat race, Savatgy was still able to make it into the Main with a third-place finish and, come main event time, the Kawasaki rider was the first one out of the first turn, picking up his first holeshot of the year. Osborne pressured him all throughout the first half of the race until he finally made the pass after seven minutes of racing. Alex Martin had been running in third but went down in the closing stages, holding up his teammate Jordon Smith in fourth. Smith was able to sneak on by, however, and held onto the podium spot ahead of Martin and Adam Cianciarulo. Cianciarulo pulled off a top five finish despite being injured in a crash with Osborne during practice. \nUnofficial 450SX results:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T05:10:58.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
