Today it was the latter, when Drudge praised Senator Rand Paul, tweeting that he had an \"Intriguing lunch in hill office of America's best senator, Rand Paul. He's bold, brave and has somehow kept his heart in such a corrupt city.\" Intriguing lunch in hill office of America's best senator, Rand Paul. He's bold, brave and has somehow kept his heart in such a corrupt city \nâ€” MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) March 30, 2017 \nWhile according to many, Drudge was a driving force behind the Trump election, Drudge has been very outspoken recently about his displeasure with the GOP. \nIn early February , Drudge tweeted that the \"Republican party should be sued for fraud. NO discussion of tax cuts now. Just lots of crazy. Back to basics, guys!\" and \"No Obamacare repeal, tax cuts! But Republicans vote to shut Warren? Only know how to be opposition not lead! DANGER \" \nOne month later, Drudge was even more direct , saying \"Republicans lied about wanting tax cuts. Can we get our votes back?\" \nThen, last Thursday, amid the struggle to rally enough Republican votes to pass an ObamaCare repeal-and-replace plan, he tweeted, \"The swamp drains you,\" which many saw as a jab at President Trump's campaign pledge to \"drain the swamp.\" \nAs The Hill notes , this was not the first time he's singled Paul in a favorable light: earlier this month the Drudge Report featured a headline touting, \"The return of Rand Paul,\" which was viewed as a warning to moderate Republicans. The headline linked to a Washington Examiner story that outlined Paul's problems with the GOP's healthcare bill. \nRand Paul has consistently called for repeaking Obamacare first, and worrying how to replace it later. So far this strategy has proven unsuccessful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:39:00.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
