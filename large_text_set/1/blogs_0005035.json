Dick Clark Productions fired back , calling the claims “defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.”\nA source close to the production tells Page Six: “It was totally [Carey’s] screw-up . . . Her assistant came out for the sound check, not her.” Our insider added of Carey, “All her dancers were in step. Everybody else onstage heard the track. Even without [the earpiece] there were eight speakers onstage. It was not the sound people.”\nMariah Carey performs on New Year’s Eve. FilmMagic A second source at the rehearsal added: “The sound check was about 20 minutes. A stand-in did the whole routine with the mike. Mariah was on the side of the stage, and at the very end — no more than four seconds — she goes up and goes, ‘La-da-dee-da . . . Everything sounds great. Love you, New York,’ and left.”\nThe first source said of the live show, “She was like a lost puppy . . . She wasn’t even standing where she was supposed to . . . There was no [production] reason she couldn’t do it.” The source said performers were to play at Planet Hollywood afterwards, but that while the others showed up for the private gig, Carey did not.\nCarey posted a picture of herself rehearsing for the live show. But co-host Jenny McCarthy claimed on her SiriusXM show : “Mariah didn’t do a sound check . . . She did whatever you would call like a ‘dance move rehearsal,’ holding her gold microphone, and she . . . had a stand-in do a sound check.” She said, “Her voice is not there anymore.” Carey’s rep said, “None of this is true.”\n\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:15:25.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
