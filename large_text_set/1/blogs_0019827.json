Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester United target Goncalo Guedes was left out Benfica’s line-up for Sunday’s match against Tondela, fuelling speculation a move to the Premier League is on. \nRecord believe the winger’s omission means he’s on his way to England, or Paris Saint-Germain who are also interested in the 20-year-old. \nBut the Portuguese club’s boss Rui Vitoria, who is no stranger to big clubs making a push for his players, believes Guedes is sticking around. \n“I understood that it was not the game for Goncalo Guedes to play, I have to take options, there are more players in Benfica and I chose,” he said. \n\"I have no indication that he will leave.” \nHere are Monday's other top stories ... Top stories from Monday's Daily Mirror \nJose Mourinho won’t stand in Wayne Rooney’s way if he wants a big-money move to China. Chinese champions Guangzhou Evergrande and Super League rivals Beijing Guoan are prepared to fork out a staggering £700,000-a-week to lure record-breaking Rooney away from Manchester United this summer. Mourinho understands the 31-year-old United and England skipper, who scored his record 250th goal for the club in Saturday's draw at Stoke, may be tempted because he is no longer a regular under him and says the decision will be Rooney’s. United boss Mourinho (inset) says Rooney's future is up to the man himself \nAntonio Conte believes Diego Costa has silenced all the talk about him - but the Chelsea boss refused to guarantee the striker’s long-term future. Costa does not want to sign a new deal and intends to keep his options open until the summer. Chinese club Tianjin Quanjian are prepared to offer the marksman a staggering deal worth £576,000-a-week. Chelsea would prefer to sell Costa, who was making his 100th Blues appearance, at the end of this season rather than allow the 28-year-old’s value to plummet during the final two years of his deal. \nRaheem Sterling was punished for being too honest and should have dived in THAT incident during Saturday's draw with Tottenham. That is the remarkable claim from Sterling's Manchester City team-mate Yaya Toure, who claimed referee Andre Marriner denied their Blues two clear penalties as the match ended 2-2. A Sterling goal, or a converted penalty, would have put City 3-1 up with 13 minutes left \nJack Wilshere will make a decision over his Arsenal future at the end of the season. The on-loan Bournemouth midfielder has 18 months remaining on his contract at the Emirates and has yet to be offered an extension. Wilshere has impressed during his time with the Cherries, who are keen to keep him beyond next summer, while AC Milan are reportedly monitoring his situation. \nHull want to sign Liverpool reject Lazar Markovic on loan until the end of the campaign. The Serb is currently on a season-long loan at Sporting Lisbon but the Portuguese giants are desperate to get shot of him after a miserable spell in the Primeira Liga (via Liverpool Echo) Lazar Markovic is wanted by Hull City (Photo: Lachlan Cunningham) Gossip from other newspapers and websites \nClaudio Ranieri has been branded a “liar” in an astonishing attack by Leonardo Ulloa’s agent. Horacio Rossi is furious after the Leicester boss and FIFA Coach of the Year insisted that his Argentine striker, 30, will be staying at the club – despite the player handing in an official transfer request. (The Sun) \nManchester United and Chelsea are weighing up bids of up to €200 million to land Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale in the summer transfer window, Don Balon reports. (Via Goal.com) \n\"Only the last details have to be clarified\" for Swede Alexander Isak to finalise his move to B orussia Dortmund , claims Germany's Bild. The Swede traveled to Dortmund with his advisors, his parents and a brother. Manager Michael Zorc... stayed for the negotiations in Dortmund.
