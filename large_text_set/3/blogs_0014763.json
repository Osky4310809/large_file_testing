Maybe I should have just run the middle lane there just to be safe.” \nIt was also the fourth time in five Cup races Larson has posted a runner-up finish, dating back to the 2016 season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. \n“I wish I wouldn’t have gotten sideways there in (Turns) 1 and 2,” Larson added. “I would have stayed close enough to Newman and I probably would have got him down in (Turns) 3 and 4 coming to the white. You never know though. That’s how the races play out. Maybe I made a mistake there.” \nDespite coming up just short, Larson leaves the Valley of the Sun with the points lead in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series standings. \n“This one stings because I feel like I was in the best spot out of anybody there to line up fourth on two tires,” Larson said. “But, it’s really, really cool to be the point leader right now. That was a goal of mine going into today (Sunday).” \nNow Larson looks on to Auto Club Speedway to break the streak, a place where he scored a win in the XFINITY Series and a second-place finish in Cup — both of which came in 2014. \n“We’ll hopefully continue to have this speed in our race cars and maybe close some of these races out,” Larson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T01:55:07.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
