It’s a feature seen on Sony Xperia devices previously and works by increasing the sensitivity of the display. Meanwhile, LDAC support provides Hi-Res audio when used with compatible LDAC headphones.\nSony doesn’t go into details about the new camera app, but says that it has also improved device performance when it’s under heavy load. In addition, the firmware delivers February’s security patches, but VoLTE has been removed from this build due to complications on German networks.\nSee also: Sony Xperia XZ Premium’s slow motion feature is a BURST of 960 FPS goodness 1 day ago Sony’s Concept updates run alongside its official updates, acting as an experimental outlet for its developers to test drive new features and rethink old ideas concerning its Xperia UI; the improvements implemented are often based on community feedback.\nNote that these updates are only available to Xperia X owners in Europe who have signed up for Concept updates on the Experimental track.
