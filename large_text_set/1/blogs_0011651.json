It confirmed that the handsets would go on sale in Europe by early February and that several Asian markets would get them by late January. According to a new report out of Russia, the Galaxy A3 (2017), Galaxy A5 (2017) and Galaxy A7 (2017) have already gone on sale in the country. Multiple online retailers have started selling the device. \nThe Galaxy A3 (2017) , Galaxy A5 (2017) and Galaxy A7 (2017) carry price tags of 22,990 rubles ($387), 27,990 rubles ($471) and 32990 ($555) rubles respectively. The fact that they’re already out in Russia makes it the first country where Samsung has released its latest mid-range handsets. It has only opened pre-orders for the new series in the United Kingdom so far. \nThe Galaxy A (2017) series brings some great new features to the lineup, including but not limited to IP68 water and dust resistance, 16-megapixel front cameras, USB Type-C and more.
