So the regulation takes effect only after the issuance, especially if they have a policy prior to the issuance. If the government agency does not have any prior policy, then Civil Service rules shall apply,” he said in a text message.   \nThe adoption of the CSC dismissal sanction was approved by the DDB during its regular meeting last Jan. 26 and was adopted on Feb. 14. \nThe regulation will take effect 15 days after its March 8 publication and registration with the Office of National Administrative Register. \nIt amends the current penalties under Section 2 of DDB Regulation 2, Series of 2004 or the Guidelines for the Formulation and Implementation of a Drug-Free Workplace Program and the Conduct of Authorized Drug Testing by all Offices, Bureaus and Agencies of the National and Local Governments, GOCCs and other Institutes of Learning including State Colleges and Universities. \nUnder the old regulation, government officials and employees may still undergo treatment programs like counseling and rehabilitation and will only be suspended or dismissed if they test positive for the second time. \nRandom drug testing for officers and employees of public and private offices is already mandated under Section 36 of RA 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, which also calls for the promotion of a National Drug-Free Workplace Program.
