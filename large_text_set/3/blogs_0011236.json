The Finnish firm’s next handsets are expected to be named the Nokia 7 and Nokia 8, and according to some sources, they’ll bring improved displays and faster processors.\nNokia’s latest Android devices are certainly pretty, but they were designed with budget-conscious consumers in mind. That means adopters must settle for entry-level specifications in favor of affordable price tags. But according to NokiaPowerUser , the Nokia 7 and Nokia 8 will be beefier devices with metal unibodies and slimmer bezels.\nBoth devices are expected to offer a brand new Snapdragon 660 processor. Benchmarks that leaked out earlier this week reveal the chip boasts eight processing cores, Adreno 512 graphics, and support for dual-channel LPDDR4 RAM and super-fast UFS storage. The chipset also supports Category 10 LTE, and up to 24-megapixel camera sensors.\nThe Nokia 7 will reportedly offer a 1080p display, while the Nokia 8 will feature a sharper Quad HD panel. It’s thought the former will be slightly smaller, but the report doesn’t reveal exactly how big the displays will be for either handset. Other features are said to include fast-charging technology, fingerprint scanners, and improved cameras.\nLike Nokia’s most recent handsets, the Nokia 7 and Nokia 8 will be manufactured by Chinese company HMD Global , which reportedly has 6-7 handsets planned for 2017. It’s not yet clear when the new devices will be available, or how much they’ll cost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T13:42:16.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
