Could   \nZlatan Ibrahimovic is stalling on committing his future to Manchester United next season because of concerns over their Champions League prospects. \nIbrahimovic is reluctant to go a second season without playing in the world’s most prestigious club competition. \nThe Swedish striker is 36 in October and believes next season could be his last at one of Europe’s top clubs before he heads to the MLS. \nChampions League football is hugely important to him and he does not want to miss out on it in what is likely to be his final campaign.
