It spells doom for the future of education in the country. \n“Parents are not doing their children a favour by registering them in such centres. They are only ruining their future as they will not be able to defend such results,’’ he said. \nHe, however, called on government at all levels to device means to try and stamp out the rapid increase of miracle centres in the country. \nThe lecturer also urged the parents to desist from encouraging their children of exam malpractices and learn to instil in their children the concept of discipline and hard work.
