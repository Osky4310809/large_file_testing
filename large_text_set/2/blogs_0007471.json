'Depriving victims' \nInspector of Constabulary Mike Cunningham said crime recording processes within the Merseyside force were \"not fully effective\". \nMerseyside was under-recording too many reports of violent and sexual offences, excluding rape, the report said. \nIt added: \"Those failings are depriving many victims of the services to which they are entitled and are a cause of concern.\" \nDeputy Chief Constable Carl Foulkes, of Merseyside Police, said the force had already implemented some recommendations and was \"working to rectify other areas raised\". \nDevon and Cornwall Police was also rated \"inadequate\", after inspectors found it was only recording 82% of crimes, amounting to more than 17,400 crimes not being recorded.
