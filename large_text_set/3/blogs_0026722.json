Courtesy of Will Russell\nI've spent a lot of time researching and honing habits of success in various areas of my life: diet, exercise, and personal development, to name a few.\nSome of the most valuable habits I've identified go back to basics. They aren't anything fancy. In fact, all I need to complete them is something to write with.\nMy favorite writing exercises, when I do them consistently, make me more productive, effective, and just plain happy.\nThey've also been crucial in keeping me focused while I build my business, which I started doing full-time after quitting my job a little over a year ago .\nWeekly whiteboard Every Sunday night, I write five core business goals for the following week on the whiteboard in my office. If a task isn't aligned with these, I won't do it.\nWarren Buffet's 2/25 rule inspired this.\nIn short, Buffet tells us to identify 25 goals you'd like to achieve. Circle the top 5. However appealing they might seem, everything not circled becomes your Avoid-At-All-Cost list.\nI also highlight a few of my favorite Quote: s on the board. I use these to stay positive, focused, and mindful.\nCourtesy of Will Russell\nWeekly ideation I don't consider myself much of an \"idea person\", but neuroplasticity tells me that I can change that. To do so, I commit time to coming up with new, random ideas for no purpose other than giving my brain a workout.\nThey might be future business ideas, though they're just as likely to be haphazard plans that I'll never pursue. It's not hard to find time to do this — it's the perfect task for a commute or a lazy Friday afternoon.\nThe list sits in Evernote, creatively titled \"Random ideas.\"\nDaily gratitude A more personal daily habit is to write down three things for which I'm grateful.\nSometimes they're personal, sometimes they're serious, and sometimes they're ridiculous. For me, it's the first part of the sentence \"I'm thankful for…\" — the awareness of gratitude — that provides the benefit, not what comes next. Courtesy of Will Russell\nDaily goal setting Every evening, I write out my three core goals in a notebook: one business, one personal, and one for personal development.\nThese are \"big\" goals that I want to achieve over a longer period of time — yearly, for example. Writing these down daily keeps them top of mind, ensuring they're transmitted into my day-to-day decisions.\nNext, I prepare myself for the following day by setting out three smaller tasks I want to complete. Essentially, I'm just rewriting tasks from my tasks management tool (Asana, if you're interested). But it means I wake up knowing exactly what I want to get done and waste no time getting to it.\nDaily reflection In addition to \"looking forward\" every day with goal setting, I also commit to \"looking back.\"\nEach evening, I write down three wins from that day. Studies by Teresa Amabile and Steven J. Kramer identified small wins as a critical component in what they call the \"progress loop.\" By focusing on successes, you improve your mindset, which increases productivity and leads to more success.\nI follow that with writing down one lesson I learned that day. I love this one. Unlike goals and wins, which can be repetitive, this exercise forces me to reflect and really think about the details of my day so I can come up with a new, unique lesson that I almost didn't even realize I learned.\nWill Russell is digital marketer living in San Francisco helping nonprofits and social enterprises use marketing to increase their impact.
