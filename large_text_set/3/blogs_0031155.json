(Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY Sports) Let us join together now in the knowledge that none of us knows a damned thing. I know nothing. You know nothing. Our friends, neighbors, co-workers and (especially) relatives know nothing. We should stop analyzing these games. We should stop trying to divine clues from these games. We should stop studying the past to try to figure out the future. South Carolina is in the Final Four.\nWait, it’s more than that.\nSouth Carolina is in the Final Four as the team that won the most handily of the four, dodged the fewest breathless moments, caused its fans the smallest psychic and physiological damage.\nWait, it’s more than that .\nSouth Carolina is an athletic program that spent so much of our national history of intercollegiate contempt as irrelevant and scarred that even serious people once dubbed it cursed.\nBut first, let’s play “Read The Past Transcripts,” because South Carolina provides one of the most fun cases ever of that game. This news-conference transcript comes from just 17 days ago, on March 10 at the Southeastern Conference Tournament in Nashville, and it’s laugh-riotous. The Gamecocks have just lost to Alabama in the quarterfinals by the feckless score of 64-53 to tumble to 22-10 and 3-6 since Feb. 7. They’re careening, plunging and just about forgotten.\n[ South Carolina’s improbable run heads into the Final Four ]\nA reporter asks Coach Frank Martin if he feels disappointment.\n“No,” replies a miffed Martin, “I’m actually ecstatic. I feel wonderful that we came in here two years in a row and can’t make it to Saturday. I’m ecstatic. I’m going to go home and throw a party at my house tonight.”\nHe moves on to the 21st-century etymology of the term “dog.”\n“You go play Alabama and to have a chance to win, you got to have some dog in you,” he says. “We had little puppies out there tonight … We got a bunch of really good kids on our team. I need guys that got a little bit more dog in them. I’m just telling you the truth.”\nHe gets to the subject of offensive rebounding.\n“Think about this,” he says. “Dazon Ingram (of Alabama) grabbed four offensive rebounds. All the guys that play the 4 and 5 for us combined grabbed three … You put me out there, 50 years of age, and (if) somehow I can manage 30 minutes in a game, which I don’t know that happens, I’m getting an offensive rebound.”\nThen the subject was NCAA Tournament bids. Would South Carolina get one?\n“At the end of the day,” said the coach who’d yet to have one in five South Carolina seasons, “the committee is not going to call me to ask my opinion.”\nMaybe it was good it didn’t.\n[ 2017 March Madness: The Final Four from A to Z ]\nSeventeen days later, the Gamecocks have reached their first Sweet 16 of the 33-season big-bracket era, their first Elite Eight ever and their first Final Four ever, and nobody knows anything. They have beaten the frightening and clearly Final Four-bound No. 2 seed Duke, the leftover favorite No. 3 seed Baylor; and the too-familiar-for-comfort No. 4 seed Florida, to which they lost by 15 points 33 days prior.\nThey have done so even without the normal palpitations: without trailing by five with five minutes to go (as did North Carolina to Kentucky), without trailing by five with three minutes to go (as did North Carolina to Arkansas), without trailing by three with 1:35 left or one with a minute left (as did Gonzaga to West Virginia), without an opposing coach storming the floor for a momentum-killing technical foul after officials couldn’t spot a flagrant case of goaltending (as Gonzaga got from Northwestern), and without ever seeing something so scary as a closing shot from a great college player, Derrick Walton Jr., fly through the air toward the win only to smack the rim (as Oregon saw against Michigan).\nThey have done all this as a team known only to savants and people with too much free time, even if they do have the SEC Player of the Year with the fantastic name, Sindarius Thornwell. And they have done all this from a program with zero tournament wins since 1973 and one measly tournament cameo (43 points and out in 2004) since the telltale year 1998.\nIn 1998, an excellent No. 3 seed South Carolina bowed to No. 14 Richmond just as an excellent No. 2 seed South Carolina had bowed to No. 15 Coppin State in 1997. In the baffled postgame, the tough guard Melvin Watson said, “There’s got to be an answer to it. Two years in a row? We’re a good team. I just can’t figure it out. Maybe it’s the ‘Chicken Curse.’”\nThe inimitable Charleston columnist Ken Burger, who died in 2015, found that moment remarkable, because it showed the phrase “Chicken Curse,” attributed by experts to Doug Nye, the beloved former editor and writer at two Columbia (S.C.) newspapers, had sunk all the way in. Across a century, nibbles at relevance always met with clouds of doom, even if football did improve after 2000.\n[ Highlights, analysis and more from the Elite Eight ]\nNow comes this team, 22-10 and incapable of an offensive rebound three Fridays ago, suddenly devoid of even a whiff of a curse. It tipped off against Marquette as a first-round afterthought late in the evening on March 17, after almost all the other 67 teams had finished playing, and 210 hours later, it had made itself a subject to live clear to next century. It had captured even a dramatic Sunday of Elite Eight heave-sobbing.\nThe Florida player sobbing on the bench proved to be only a precursor. The sobbing achieved by Kentucky freshman star De’Aaron Fox after the frenetic ending of North Carolina-Kentucky not only reminded us that March is a procession of honorable crying from kids who care deeply. It reimagined the concept of the carefree one-and-done, as Fox grasped the reality of the ending of the chapter and reached to hug the teammate seated next to him, Bam Adebayo.\nMadness, which hadn’t been quite so mad this March, had reached a delightfully motley Final Four with North Carolina and three proud strays. Two of those, Gonzaga and South Carolina, dogs and chickens, have never ventured this far into the commotion. The other, Oregon, the Ducks, reached a “Final Four” that wasn’t a Final Four or a Final Four in 1939, as Oregon and Ohio State met in Evanston, Ill., for a final two that nobody called a final two.\nThat’s a lot of motley, but South Carolina alone would be motley aplenty. Nineteen years ago after the loss to Richmond, the leading scorer in program history, B.J. McKie, said, “I’m thinking this has got to be a dream. I hope I wake up at the hotel and get to do it all over again. But I’m still standing here and nobody’s waking me up.”\nCome Sunday, the Columbia native and guard P.J. Dozier also seemed to dwell within a dream and said, “I’m speechless, man, honestly.”\nJustin McKie, a senior guard who played 13 minutes with three points and two rebounds, went up into Madison Square Garden to hug his father, in this video captured by John Del Bianco of 247 Sports. An outcome no one saw coming had come to arguably the country’s most durable college sports fans with the largest historical quotient of enthusiasm to trophies. And if you didn’t feel happy for all of them just 16 days after the typing of one moribund transcript, then you’re just a big old Grinch.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@ChuckCulpepper1"], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:10:50.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
