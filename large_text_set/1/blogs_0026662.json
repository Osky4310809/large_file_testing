When you pick up a Lego brick, you don’t realize the journey it has taken to get from the very beginning of an idea in 1932, to being on your living room floor, ready to be turned into a plane, or train, a storm trooper, or anything you want.\nHaving started simply because he was made redundant, the young carpenter began creating high-quality wooden toys that he began to sell himself, encouraged by his children’s enthusiasm for his creations.\nA few generations later, following an investor who ended up to be bankrupt, factory floors burning to the ground (twice!), and the loss of the founder, still the family who created and developed Lego got back up on their feet and began building from scratch. They were doing this for each other. And that’s why they never gave up.\nThis story is inspiring because it encourages us to not only follow our bliss and reach for our dreams, but also to remember that whenever things look dire and we think that we have been broken by circumstance, there is always another way around the problem, if we just take the time to make it.\nThe post The Story About LEGO Is Not About Playing With Toys, But Building A Dream appeared first on Lifehack .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T19:18:28.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
