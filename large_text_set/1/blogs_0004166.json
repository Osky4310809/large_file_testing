Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, Quezon City Police District director, said policemen were about to arrest suspect Harold Moises for indiscriminate firing when he reportedly engaged authorities in a shootout. Philstar.com/File \nMANILA, Philippines – Quezon City policemen shot dead last Monday during an alleged shootout a suspect in a case of indiscriminate firing on New Year’s Eve. \nChief Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, Quezon City Police District director, said policemen were about to arrest suspect Harold Moises for indiscriminate firing when he reportedly engaged authorities in a shootout. \nThe reported encounter occurred at around 4:30 p.m. along Kabisig corner Katangian streets in Barangay Batasan Hills. \nBefore the shootout, Eleazar said they received information from a concerned citizen that the suspect was spotted along Katangian street with a gun tucked in his waist. \nA police team was deployed. When the team approached, Moises allegedly pulled out a caliber .45 pistol and fired at the policemen, who fired back. \nMoises was pronounced dead at the East Avenue Medical Center from multiple gunshot wounds in the body.   \nPolice said a handgun and three sachets of shabu were recovered from Moises. \nInvestigators said witnesses claimed that Moises had fired his pistol indiscriminately during the New Year’s Eve revelry in Batasan Hills. \nMeanwhile, the Pasig City policeman who fired his pistol indiscriminately during a quarrel in Tondo, Manila last Dec. 19 was disarmed and relieved from his post after administrative charges were filed against him, a police official said yesterday. \nChief Supt. Romulo Sapitula, director of the Eastern Police District (EPD), said Police Officer 1 Ronel Pantig was relieved from the Pasig City police and reassigned to the District Headquarters Service Unit. \nSenior Supt. Orlando Yebra, Pasig City police chief, disarmed Pantig of his Beretta 9mm pistol. \nAn administrative case for grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a police officer was filed before the EPD’s Office of the District Internal Affairs Service last Dec. 29. \nOn the other hand, the pre-charge investigation and summary hearing proceeding will be conducted by the Internal Affairs Service of the Manila Police District, which has jurisdiction over the case. \nPolice investigator SPO1 Jay Jay Jacob disclosed that the criminal case against Pantig for violation of Article 254, RPC (Illegal Discharge of Firearm) would be filed later before the Manila Prosecutor’s Office. \nPantig fired his service firearm at the height of an argument with the brother of a certain Anthony Barsa Tan last Dec. 19 at the corner of Rivera and La Torre streets in Barangay 245, Zone 22 in Tondo. \nIn the Cordillera region, Chief Supt. Elmo Francis Sarona, regional police director, said a retired policeman and a soldier were among those arrested for indiscriminate firing during the holiday season. \nHe said retired police officer Wilfredo Bunagan Duenas was arrested after firing his gun while he was driving a hand tractor in Barangay San Quintin, Rizal, Kalinga. \nSarona said Army soldier Serafin Masiong Fianza of Bekes of Paoay, Atok, Benguet was arrested after firing his pistol inside a videoke bar. \nSarona said aside from the two indiscriminate firing cases, no other untoward incident was reported in the Cordilleras where local government units stopped issuing permits to traders selling fireworks. \nThe Southern Police District (SPD) admitted yesterday that investigators are still looking for leads in the case of the stray bullet that hit a 10-year-old boy in Taguig City on New Year’s Eve. \nSPD director Chief Supt. Tomas Apolinario said they are still gathering evidence to pinpoint the origin of the bullet that struck the head of Gian Penacilla. \nPenacilla is recovering after doctors removed the bullet slug from his head at the Rizal Medical Center in Pasig City. \nThe victim was outside their house in Barangay Palingon when a bullet hit him on the head at around 10:45 p.m. last Saturday. \nProbers are hoping the slug could provide a lead to the identity of the registered owner of the gun, if the firearm is licensed. \nThe Taguig City government paid the medical bills of the victim, said Apolinario. - With Non Alquitran, Cecille Suerte Felipe  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T06:29:03.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
