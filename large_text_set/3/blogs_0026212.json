(Photo: Valerio Pennicino) Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nWe've all heard footballers claim that they'd dreamed of playing for their boyhood clubs all their lives, but this is a little different. \nItalian forward Antonio Di Natale might not be as famous as some of his compatriots who played in the same era as him, but there is little doubt that the Italian forward was a fine player and one who was hugely respected in Serie A right up until his retirement last year. \nAt his peak earlier this decade, the 42-times capped international regularly found the back of the net with ease, scoring over 20 goals in five consecutive seasons between 2009/10 and 2013/14. Finding the net... again (Photo: Dino Panato) \nBut he did so while carrying a secret. \nBecause Di Natale - who was born in Naples and grew up as a huge Napoli fan - claims that he avoided signing for them in case he didn't perform well enough. \n“Why did I never play for Napoli?\" he told Italian radio station Radio Crc. \"I am Neapolitan and I love Naples, but for me wearing that jersey would’ve been too big a weight and I was afraid of not being able to do well.\" Obviously not against Napoli (Photo: Dino Panato) \nIn addition, Di Natale also claims that he didn't even like playing AGAINST Napoli, something he only did 14 times over a 20-year career. \n“Scoring against them was like scoring against my brother, so it was best to avoid it,” he joked. \nWell at least he's honest about it. \nWould you feel the same way? poll loading Do you love your club a *bit* too much? 0+ VOTES SO FAR No, just the right amount Yes, maybe a little I named my child after the entire 1992 promotion-winning team Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:12:50.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
