Christina El Moussa: It's a Battle of the Revenge Bods! by Desiree Murphy 7:35 PM PDT, March 30, 2017 Photo: Getty Images Tarek and Christina El Moussa may be playing it cool on their HGTV show, Flip or Flop , but off-camera, there seems to be a battle for best revenge body brewing. Over the past week, the former couple has been flaunting their fab figures via social media, which have seemingly toned up ever since they announced last December that they had called it quits after seven years of marriage. A post shared by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on Mar 23, 2017 at 12:01pm PDT The blond beauty's slimmer figure was on full display in a video posted by the swimwear brand on Snapchat, highlighting her enviable abs. Photo: Snapchat Christina was wearing the same two-piece and showing off her toned booty in another photo posted to Instagram just a few days later: A post shared by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on Mar 26, 2017 at 8:59am PDT WATCH: Tarek and Christina El Moussa Share Behind-the-Scenes Pics From Set, Prove They're Amicable The reality star, who also shares 1-year-old son Brayden with Tarek, told ET earlier this month that she and her ex \"are in a good spot.\" For her, part of that happiness comes from practicing yoga. \"Going through a divorce is tough on anyone,\" she said at the time. \"I've found yoga, and yoga has really helped me relieve a lot of stress and really helped me think that I have control over my emotions and just really find peace.\" She's also found running to be a great distraction, telling People , \"There is nothing like a good three-mile run for me to really clear my head and get my endorphins going.\" \"I have the most amazing private [yoga] instructor who has changed my life,\" she added. \"Our sessions are very spiritual and have really helped me cope with my divorce and other emotions I'm going through during this time.\" RELATED: Tarek and Christina El Moussa Negotiating Next Season of 'Flip or Flop' Christina also recently fell in love with a new fitness franchise, Orangetheory Fitness, which focuses on circuit and high-intensity interval training. She admitted that ever since she took her first class, she's been \"totally hooked.\" \"It combines running, which is my favorite workout, with weight training, which I never do on my own,\" she explained. \"It goes by super quickly and is always challenging. And it helped to get me in the best shape of my 30s!\" And while Christina is without a doubt looking hotter than ever, Tarek claims he, too, is \"in the best shape\" of his life. The cancer survivor posted a shirtless pic of himself on Thursday, admitting that at first, he was \"too embarrassed to share\" it. \"I know my journey has inspired many people so I made the difficult decision to post,\" he wrote alongside the sexy snap. \"This is after battling 2 cancers and a debilitating back injury. My doctor said 'You would probably never be able to lift weights again'... that motivated me to prove him wrong and get into the best shape of my life!!!\" A post shared by Tarek El Moussa (@therealtarekelmoussa) on Mar 30, 2017 at 12:12pm PDT RELATED: Tarek El Moussa Shares Shirtless Pic on Instagram: I'm in 'the Best Shape of My Life' He was also looking extra buff on Monday, showing off his bulky biceps after hiking in Costa Rica. A post shared by Tarek El Moussa (@therealtarekelmoussa) on Mar 26, 2017 at 6:03pm PDT Tarek credits his trainer, Quintin Tucker, for helping him achieve his fitness goals, and judging by this pic, he definitely hasn't been skipping leg day.
