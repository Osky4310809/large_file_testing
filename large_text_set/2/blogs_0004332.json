You’ll need some plywood, wood glue, and some basic hardware you can get at any big box store. You’ll also need a box fan, and a 20x20x1 air filter like you’d usually use for a house. Once it’s all put together, you can pop open the box, place your object in the center, turn on the fan, and paint without worrying about over-spray and nasty fumes. You can find the complete instructions for the project at the link below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:05:45.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
