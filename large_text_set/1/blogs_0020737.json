The clerk then excuses himself for a second to change the batteries on his remote because all of a sudden they don’t work and no sooner does he leave when Samara begins to emerge from one of the screens. \nNaturally, most people were frightened and a pair of young men quickly ran away knocking a box over on their way out.

If you have a Netflix or Amazon Prime subscription, you'll have no shortage of options - and TheWrap picked the scariest ones sure to induce nightmares. \n\"The Witch\" (Amazon) Robert Eggers has created one of the most challenging horror films of the year: a slow-burn tale of a Puritan family that is hunted by the occult and their peculiar farm goat, Black Philip. The unveiling of the goat's true identity is one of the most deliciously chilling endings to a movie in recent memory. A24 \n\"Rosemary's Baby\" (Amazon) Considered one of the greatest horror films of all-time. With little violence, \"Rosemary's Baby\" is a masterclass on how to create the sense of existential dread. By couching its horror in the everyday activities and worries of a new mother, director Roman Polanski makes satanic cults feel all too plausible. Paramount \n\" Wes Craven 's New Nightmare\" (Netflix) This is a Freddy Krueger tale unlike any other. After a decade working on the legendary slasher franchise, Wes Craven turns the camera on himself and the people who made these films with him. \"New Nightmare\" is an exploration of how horror movies affect their creators, as well as a deconstruction of Freddy Krueger's shift from Craven's original vision as the ultimate nightmare to a goofy comic relief figure whose kills the audience had come to root for. New Line Cinema \n\"Misery\" (Amazon) If you are an \"American Horror Story\" fan who loves Kathy Bates' work, this is a can't-miss film. Bates launched herself into the pantheon of iconic horror actors with her portrayal of a deranged superfan that imprisons and tortures the author that created her obsession. Columbia Pictures \n\"The Others\" (Amazon) Nicole Kidman plays Grace, the mother of two children who are hypersensitive to sunlight and must play in the darkness everyday. But when new servants arrive to help after Grace's husband is killed in World War II, the family begins to experience some very bizarre paranormal activity. \"The Others\" is a gore-free horror classic loaded with tension and one of the most famous twist endings in the history of the genre. Dimension Films \n\"Tremors\" (Netflix & Amazon) One of the finest horror-comedy hybrids ever made and a template for later films like \"Shaun of the Dead.\" Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward play a duo of handymen/best buddies who lead a small town in the middle of nowhere in a battle against giant worms that can sense movements in the ground and want to devour them all. Unlike a lot of horror films, \"Tremors\" features protagonists that aren't facepalmingly stupid, particularly the hilarious survivalist Burt, who might be the most invincible horror protagonist whose name isn't Ash. Universal \n\"Tusk\" (Amazon) The newest edition to the body horror subgenre, \"Tusk\" will make you cringe as a snobbish writer is gruesomely transformed into a human-walrus hybrid. And yes, Fleetwood Mac's song of the same name is used in the film. A24 \n\"From Dusk Till Dawn\" (Amazon & Netflix) Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino teamed up with George Clooney to create one of the greatest B-films ever made. Tarantino and Clooney play a pair of bank-robbing brothers who, along with a pastor and his family, must fight their way through a nightclub that turns out to be a haven for bloodthirsty vampires. If you're familiar with Tarantino's history in front of a camera, you know he's going to face a very gruesome death. Troublemaker \n\"An American Werewolf In London\" (Amazon & Netflix) Even 35 years later, John Landis' classic is still praised for having the most magnificent werewolf transformation scene of all time. Along with leaving you grossed out and terrified, \"American Werewolf\" will make you wonder \"how did they do that?\" \n\"Let The Right One In\" (Amazon) At a time when \"Twilight\" was corrupting the idea of what vampire tales should be, \"Let The Right One In\" did justice not only to vampires, but to horror romance as well. The Swedish film features Oskar, a bullied, troubled kid who fantasizes about killing his bullies. One day, he meets another strange child named Eli that he falls in love with ... not realizing that he's fallen in love with a vampire. \n\"Carrie\" (Amazon) -- Brian De Palma's take on Stephen King's classic tale of abuse and revenge. \"Carrie\" is a tale of how those we perceive to be monsters could have become much different people had they been shown just a little bit more compassion in their lives. Carrie spends her whole life suffering abuse until she can finally take no more, and what she does has left everyone who has seen this film transfixed. It is also one of the very few horror films to earn Oscar nominations for its cast. \n\"The Babadook\" (Netflix) You'll be hard-pressed to find a horror film as thoughtful and intelligent as this one. \"The Babadook\" is a parable about how grief and loss can consume those who suffer through it, and despite all the coaxing and cajoling you'll get from friends, you'll never be able to \"just let go.\" \"The Babadook\" shows the process of coming to terms with loss and preparing to spend the rest of your life living with that pain, even when it's scarred over. This is proof that horror can move you as well as scare you. IFC \n\"You're Next\" (Netflix) Like a homicidal \"Home Alone,\" \"You're Next\" turns the home invasion subgenre on its head by having its protagonist brutally take down her would-be murderers one by one. It also mixes in the family dysfunction of \"Home Alone,\" as Erin has to deal with her boyfriend's obnoxious family during the bloodbath. \n\"Scream 2\" If a horror film is successful, it's bound to spawn a parade of worsening sequels until the box office demand and audience goodwill run dry. \"Scream 2\" is a fascinating deconstruction of that phenomenon, satirizing all the tropes and ridiculous tactics horror movie franchises use to keep gorehounds coming back for more. \n\"Hated In The Nation\" from \"Black Mirror\" (Netflix) Yeah, it's a TV episode rather than a movie, but at 89 minutes, the Season 3 finale of Charlie Brooker's smash hit sci-fi horror series might as well be a movie. \"Hated In The Nation\" explores how Twitter has transformed mob rule into an endless stream of harassment; and in the world this story weaves, that online hatred can literally kill. Previous Slide Next Slide 1 of 16 \nFrom classics like “Rosemary’s Baby” to new masterpieces like “The Babadook,” there’s plenty of fantastic horror movies to bingewatch \nLooking to get into the Halloween spirit with a scary movie night at home?
