Mar 23, 2017 9:00 PM 0 SHARES \nGiven today's vote fiasco, this seemed highly appropriate... \nIf you are an older senior citizen and can no longer take care of yourself and need Long-Term Care, but the government says there is no Nursing Home care available for you, what do you do? \n\nYou may opt for Medicare Part G. \nThe plan gives anyone 75 or older a gun (Part G) and one bullet. You may then shoot one worthless politician. This means you will be sent to prison for the rest of your life where you will receive three meals a day, a roof over your head, central heating and air conditioning, cable TV, a library, and all the health care you need. Need new teeth? No problem. Need glasses? Thatâ€™s great. Need a hearing aid, new hip, knees, kidney, lungs, sex change, or heart? They are all covered! As an added bonus, your kids can come and visit you at least as often as they do now! \n\nAnd, who will be paying for all of this? The same government that just told you they can't afford for you to go into a nursing home. And you will get rid of a useless politician while you are at it. \n\nAnd now, because you are a prisoner, you don't have to pay any more income taxes! \n\nIs this a great country or what? \n\n\nNow that you have solved your senior Long-Term Care problem, enjoy the rest of your week! \nSource: Unknown", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:11:29.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
