They claimed during an interview that they attempted suicide in order to escape from those they owed. \nOne of the women, Taiwo Titilayo Momoh, a textile dealer at Balogun market created a scene on the bridge as she insisted to be left alone to end it all, so as to be free from the debt she owed some importers. \nRRS Commander, Assistant Superintendent of Police, ASP, Olatunji Disu, who confirmed the report said the incident happened at about 11:25 a.m, after one Mrs. Abigael Ogunyinka was also rescued by fishermen earlier same. Momoh, (58) was in a cab heading to Lagos Island, when she ordered the cab driver to stop, on reaching Oworoshoki. She was said to have removed her shoes and was wrapping her dress around her waist tightly, when operatives of the Rapid Response Squad , RRS of the Lagos State Police command who were stationed at the point, held her. \nThe lady, who lives in Lekki, Lagos claimed that she was pushed into committing suicide in order to put an end to her constant sleeplessness and shame occasioned by her indebtedness to four different importers whose names she gave as Ridmon, Helen, Mathias and an undisclosed \nimporter to the tune of $10,000 , $7,000, $5,000 and $2,000 respectively. \nShe noted that her problem started sometimes in 2015, when a Bureau De Change dealer duped her of N18.7 million she wanted to change to pay her foreign creditors. \nShe added that the creditors had given her Swiss textiles worth several millions of naira, noting that she has maintained good relationship with the creditors for more than 15 years. \nHer condition she said was compounded when robbers invaded her shop in Lagos Island carting away most of the textiles left with her. \nShe emphasized that most of the time she had been having sleepless nights and seeing the ghosts of the creditors whenever she was alone. \nAccording to Momoh, “added to all these, my first son, whom I felt would stand by me and console me abandoned me. By the time I’m gone, maybe he would come around and inherit what is left. “I don’t want to use my debts and death to disturb anybody. I was in the shop this morning. I have looked everywhere and estimated what is there. \n“I think, with my house, a bungalow, those I am leaving behind can still live comfortably. I want to go and meet God. This world is empty. “I won’t join cult group because I want to get rich, I go my way and I don’t socialize unnecessarily. \nI was a Muslim and because of this problem I have been jumping from one faith to the other. The problem is too much for me to bear. I want to go back to God. \n“That is why I have dressed very simply, I am ready to meet Him. If He cannot address my problem on earth, let me go back to Him.” \nHowever, as the woman was being led from the RRS headquarters into a waiting police vehicle that was to take her to the police command, she created a scene on sighting cameramen. \nShe said, “I did not steal, I did not kill anybody. I only wanted to take my life. This Policeman ( pointing at the CP) said I have committed a crime. Which crime? How is my attempt to kill myself anybody’s business? Is it not my life? Let me end it all. \nOn her part, the second woman, Abigail Ogunyinka (61) said she decided to end it all because she was frustrated with life. \nLamenting that life had been unfair to her, she said she had no child and that her husband and only friend was at the moment sick. In order to get drugs for her husband who is down with stroke, she said she had so far collected loan of N150,000. \nBut she said she decided to take her life following disturbance from those she owed. Briefing newsmen at the RRS office, Alausa where the woman was taken to, the command boss, Fatai Owoseni, noted that committing suicide was an offence under the law but that the police would try to talk her out of committing suicide. \nHe informed that the woman would be taken through post-trauma programme to raise her hope, adding that the police would also do a medical evaluation on her to ascertain her condition. \nDescribing the rate of suicide in the country as worrisome, the CP said that the command had begun patrol of bridges across the state to forestall any likely suicide attempt. \nHe further disclosed that it was now an offence for individuals to walk on bridges in the state and that no vehicle would be allowed to stop on any bridge in the state henceforth in order to prevent suicide. Right now, the woman is still in trauma and she still insists that she wants to end her life,” he said.
