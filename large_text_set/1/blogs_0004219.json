It’s now available in Trendline, Comfortline and Highline, priced at RM109,578 , RM118,578 , and RM129,578 respectively (OTR without insurance). \nMeanwhile, the new B8 Passat was launched in November – all-new from the ground up, it is lighter, more spacious and quicker than before. It is available with either a 180 PS/250 Nm 1.8 litre TSI mill on the Trendline and Comfortline models or a 220 PS/350 Nm 2.0 litre TSI unit on the top-spec Highline. Prices are RM160,937 , RM180,937 and RM200,030 respectively. \nGALLERY: Volkswagen Jetta 1.4 TSI Highline facelift GALLERY: Volkswagen Passat 380 TSI Highline Research Volkswagen Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T08:49:12.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
