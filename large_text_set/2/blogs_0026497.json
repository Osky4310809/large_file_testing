Now, Rani Mukerji will return to do what she loves doing the most. She will star in Yash Raj Films’ Hichki , to be directed by Siddharth P Malhotra and produced by Maneesh Sharma. With Hichki , she will be seen in a positive and inspiring story about a woman who turns her biggest weakness into her biggest strength. Rani elaborates, “I was looking for a script that would challenge and excite me, and Hichki came my way. Each of us has a weakness that pulls us back. It could be a disability or any condition but if we just look at it as simply a hiccup, we can emerge as a winner. It won’t come in the way of achieving our dreams. Hichki is built on this positive premise and I decided to take it up.” Rani Mukerji Returns To Acting With HICHKI Hichki will be Maneesh Sharma’s third film as a producer with Yash Raj Films after Dum Laga Ke Haisha and the forthcoming Meri Pyaari Bindu . Siddharth P Malhotra, who has directed We Are Family will be making his first film with Yash Raj Films.
