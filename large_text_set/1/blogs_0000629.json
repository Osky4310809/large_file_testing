This begins her third full term as the representative for Oregon’s First Congressional District, which includes Washington, Yamhill, Clatsop, and Columbia Counties and part of Multnomah County. You can download a photo of Congresswoman Bonamici being sworn in here . “I’m honored to return to Congress representing Northwest Oregon, one of our nation’s most innovative and economically diverse regions. I will continue to stand up and work for policies that support working families, increase opportunities for American workers and businesses, strengthen public education, protect our environment, and support seniors and the vulnerable. “We have some significant challenges ahead of us. I stand with all Americans who are concerned that President-elect Trump will govern with the same harmful rhetoric that dominated his campaign. I resolve to protect the peace and well-being of American workers and families. I will vigorously oppose efforts to dismantle the health and economic security of Americans by repealing the Affordable Care Act or privatizing earned benefits like Social Security and Medicare. We can find solutions by working in the Oregon way; by collaborating with those on both sides of the aisle to find common ground. “With my role on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I will continue to work on strengthening public education, and making higher education affordable. I will continue to advocate for policies that support working families, including raising the federal minimum wage and helping workers save for a secure retirement. I will be a strong voice for high-quality, affordable child care and paid leave so families can welcome a new child or care for an ailing parent. Our economy will be stronger and our families will be healthier when we create policies that work for them, not against them. “America’s seniors have worked throughout their lives for a safe and secure retirement. I will not support policies that dismantle or privatize earned benefits like Social Security or Medicare. Last year I was proud to lead the passage of the bipartisan update to the Older Americans Act, which helps seniors live independently and safely in their communities. I look forward to building on that success to support the 10,000 people who turn 65 each day. “Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time. In Oregon, our region’s economy depends on natural resources. For the fishers and mariners who depend on a healthy ocean and the wine growers and farmers who need access to clean water, we must take action now and protect our planet for future generations. As a member of the House Science Committee I will always fight for policy decisions to be based on sound science, and lead the search for innovative solutions to reduce carbon emissions and increase investment in renewable energy sources. “Along with my work in Washington, D.C., I look forward to hearing from my constituents in Oregon. I will be hosting regular town hall meetings and visiting schools and local businesses to hear directly about Oregonians’ successes and challenges. And my office will continue to serve those who need assistance with a federal agency. “Over the next two years, I am confident we can meet any challenge before us if we, listen to each other and find common ground. It is truly an honor to represent the people of Oregon’s First Congressional District.” ###", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:13:09.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
