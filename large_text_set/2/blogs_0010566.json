On Jan. 29, recall, Iran launched a new type of medium-range ballistic missile capable of reaching all of Europe, in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions.\nLast Thursday, the Trump administration announced it was putting Iran “on notice.” And on Friday — the same day the new missile was first seen — Washington announced sanctions against 25 individuals and companies involved in Iran’s ballistic-missile program.\nThat was a response unlike anything Tehran saw in eight years under President Barack Obama — whose State Department routinely issued reports critical of Iran, but turned a blind eye to the Islamic Republic’s nefarious behavior, not to mention its repeated violations of the sweetheart nuclear deal.\nIt’s a sign that for Iran, the days of wine and roses — and blind-eye treatment — are over. And perhaps an even more welcome sign that tough talk, combined with tough action, really does work. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:58:50.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
