You paid for a Windows VERSION number with a LIMITED support period of which in the case of 7, that support ended two years ago. It's really that simple. Also, your phone app analogy is extremely flawed. There are TONS OF APPS that do not work unless you update your Android OS. And many, MANY phones don't get Android OS updates, hell this is one of the primary criticisms Android has always siuffered from, and one of the main reasons my phone is a Nexus 5 which gets stock Android directly from Google itself. That is also why I said that Microsoft's lifecycle policy is one of the best in the business. And it really is, only MacOSX comes close to it. And when you look at W7 enterprise and embedded, it is truly unsurpassed. The only other OS in the world with a longer lfecycle is Linux, which is community driven for the most part. Last, no need to get all touchy and personal at all.... Full support VS Extended (security only) Windows XP 14 april 2009 8 april 2014 Windows Vista 10 april 2012 11 april 2017 Windows 7* 13 januari 2015 14 januari 2020 Windows 8 9 januari 2018 10 januari 2023 Now, we could have a debate on dropping the support for 8, but when it comes to 'is this illegal'.... I strongly doubt you'll get Microsoft convicted because of all the reasons I posted earlier. Boy, you just ignored the point, again (as if I said anything about android or software updates when what I meant was hardware). You keep saying win 7 as if you have a point. You don't. Why does joe schmo with his 10 yr old dual core get updates, but I don't? You can't legitimately answer that, so you go off on tangents and say \"support is ending soon.\" Do us a favor and stop defending these assholes, mmkay?
