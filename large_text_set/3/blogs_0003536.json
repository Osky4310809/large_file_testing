In an interview with Extra , Baldwin said he might retire from his impersonation of the president, not because he was over-worked or wanted to work on his new book , but out of concern for the well-being of viewers. “The maliciousness of this White House has people worried… that’s why I’m not going to do it much longer, the impersonation, I don’t know how much more people can take it,” Baldwin said.\nThat said, the actor is game to continue his impersonation of Trump at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner —if they ask him. “If they wanted me to do it, I would probably do it, but I’m not quite sure they’ll do. I think they may have a whole other idea,” Baldwin told Extra, adding, “I think a lot of people are thinking if Trump himself doesn’t come and face the music as it were… I don’t know what kind of program they’re going to have.” It’s equally hard to imagine what kind of show SNL would have without Baldwin as the commander in chief. \nPerhaps Kate McKinnon can play Jeff Sessions, Hillary Clinton , and Donald Trump?\n[ Extra ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:24:18.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
