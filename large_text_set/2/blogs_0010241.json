There are however Jumma’at Mosques in some of the IDP camps with members of the forum of Jumma’at Imams leading fellow displaced persons from their communities. PRESIDENT BUHARI IN LONDON: PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI RECEIVES APC CHIEFTAINS, SENATOR BOLA AHMED TINUBU AND CHIEF BISI AKANDE, AT ABUJA HOUSE IN LONDON ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2017 \nThe prayers followed a request conveyed by the who communicated with all Imams of functional Jumma’at Mosques through their different forums \nThe Chief Imam of Borno State, Imam Laisu Ibrahim Ahmed mobilized fellow Imams for the special prayers based on letters addressed to him and the Borno State chairman of the Christians Association of Nigeria (CAN), Bishop William Naga by Governor Kashim Shettima. \nThe State Commissioner for Religious Affairs, Mustapha Fannarambe signed the two letters titled, “Request for Intensification of prayers for the complete recovery of Mr President’. The letters asked the Chief Imam to communicate the request to Imams of all Jumma’at (Friday) Mosques while the CAN president would communicate with Pastors for similar prayers in all churches across the State at the next Sunday service. \nThe Commissioner was mandated by Governor Shettima to monitor compliance with the request through interactions with the Chief Imam and CAN chairman. \nAccording to the commissioner, “Last night, Governor Kashim Shettima directed me to write and sign letters requesting the Chief Imam and the CAN to kindly request Imams of all Jumma’at Mosques and leading pastors in all churches across Borno State to lead Muslim and Christian worshipers today (Friday) and coming Sunday, to intensify prayers for the quick and full recovery of our dear President, Muhammadu Buhari. \nWe believe any good Nigerian living in Borno is already praying for the President, this is why we requested for the prayers to be intensified. The Governor emphasized that I ensure the Chief Imam and CAN chairman help in communicating with Imams and Pastors of all Jumma’at Mosques and all churches where Sunday services are held. \nThe letters were delivered early today (yesterday) and I have been in touch with both leaders. I can assure you that the Chief Imam communicated the request to Imams of all the Jumma’at Mosques across Borno State. All the Imams belong to different forums based on their denominations and areas of residence while the Pastors are expected to be reached by the CAN chairman through a very efficient system. \nThe prayers started today with Jumma’at Mosques and we have monitored some here in Maiduguri and Jere and I was informed there were similar prayers in other Jumma’at Mosques in Biu, Bayo, Shani, Kwaya-Kusar where residents were never displaced and places like Gwoza, Konduga, Monguno, Damboa, Dikwa, Askira, Kaga and many other parts of the State where residents have returned after liberation of their communities by the military under President Buhari’s administration. \nPrayers were offered in IDP camps where Jumma’at services took place. From our estimation, not less than 350 Jumma’at Mosques are currently functional out of 542 that we have across the State. I actually attended one of the Friday prayers in Maiduguri while Governor Shettima went to Bama with the visiting Minister of Environment. To us in Borno State, President Buhari means so much because we know how much we suffered before he became President.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:29:49.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
