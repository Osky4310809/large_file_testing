It was mocked by hockey teams , booed by Los Angeles basketball fans , color-swapped and mocked again , and now, apparently, consigned to the dustbin of history. \nGoodbye, you sad, silly logo that looked like it belonged in a movie where they couldn’t get the rights to real NFL trademarks.

Spanos said in a statement provided to PFT. “Clearly, we miscalculated how the logo would be received, and we’ve taken it out of the rotation.” \nOn their website, the team is still going with the classic lightning bolt logo, and a Chargers wordmark that deemphasizes the whole “Los Angeles” bit.
