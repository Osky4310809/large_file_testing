Darrell Sapp/Post-Gazette Nuru Mvgoya Pembeni, of Milwaukee, Wis., listens during the press conference at the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh in Oakland. Nuru's brother was the victim of a beating in the 400 block of Climax Street and remains in the Intensive Care Unit. By Peter Smith   \nPolice say they have no indication that the severe beating of a Somali Bantu refugee was a hate crime but are investigating all possibilities. \nThe attack has put his fellow refugees and Muslims even more on edge, saying they and their children have been bullied and harassed at work and school and in public buses in recent months. \n\"We fear for our lives,\" said a Somali Bantu leader who gave his name only as Omar out of concern for his safety. \nHe spoke at a news conference Thursday morning at the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh alongside police and Muslim leaders. \nAssistant Police Chief Lavonnie Bickerstaff did not identify the victim by name at the request of the family but said he is hospitalized in critical condition. \nShe said he was discovered severely beaten in the 400 block of Climax Street in Beltzhoover. He had been driving a zTrip cab. He is hospitalized in critical condition. \nMs. Bickerstaff declined to give out many details while the investigation is ongoing. \nThere is \"no evidence \" of this being a hate crime, and police are also looking into whether it was a robbery. But she urged anyone with any information potentially related to the stack to call police. \nSomali Bantu refugees fled violence and discrimination in their homeland and typically spent many years in refugee camps in Kenya before coming to the United States. \nNow they fear they are encountering the same dangers in the land where they found refuge. \nWasi Mohamed, executive director of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, said Muslims around the country have suffered hate crimes and harassment particularly given the suspicion cast on all Muslims before and after the presidential election. Somalia was one of seven countries listed on a short lived travel ban promulgated by the Trump administration, which plans to issue a revised one after the initial ban was blocked in court. \nThere are about 550 Somali Bantus living in the Pittsburgh area, many living in Northview Heights, community leaders say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:40:33.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
