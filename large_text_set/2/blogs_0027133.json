When President Buhari left Nigeria he formally wrote to the Senate putting his Vice-President in charge as Acting President until he returns.” \n“That singular act which is merely a repetition of what was done during previous extended personal visits abroad by the President is salutary as it is stellar and itself heralded the transformation in this government that we are witnessing.” L-R: Reno, Lauretta & Momodu \n“When I flew out of Lagos to Johannesburg last Monday, February 20, 2017, a US dollar was selling for about 520 naira in the omnipotent black market. As at Thursday, it was selling at around 475 Naira. By yesterday, Friday 24 February 2017the Naira was exchanging at about 460 Naira to the Dollar.” \n“What a difference a week makes. This remarkable resurgence of the Naira is coming on the heels of new policies and directives that the CBN has been mandated to put in place by the rejuvenated economic team that the Acting President is the driving force.” \n“Not just that, I received a report from Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi that the Acting President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, paid an unscheduled visit to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport on Thursday, February 23, 2016, and caught the airport officials napping. My joy knew no bounds. Only last Saturday, I had complained bitterly about that unfortunate airport on this very page.” \n“Anyway. The good news is that the Acting President has started doing some of the things we expected and advised President Buhari to do. I do not want to over-excite anyone yet but this is smelling good, like the Americans would put it. We must enter special prayers and intercede with serious fasting so that President Buhari can continue along this path of progress when he returns to office, hopefully very shortly, by the grace of God.” \nHowever, that analysis did not go down well with President Buhari’s aide on electronic media, Mrs. Lauretta Onochie as she swiftly replied Momodu saying the publisher needed to be schooled on common sense to know what team work means. \nIn a write-up she themed, “Educating Dele Momodu,” Lauretta also accused Momodu of being used to leadership where deputies dared not make a decision without the permission of their principals. \nShe wrote thus: \n“With a mindset like this, it’s not hard to work out that Dele Momodu is too clever by half. If he does not understand “Team”, how can he understand “Team Spirit”? \nThe President and the Acting President have a great understanding of what it means to be a team. They respect, consult and collaborate with each other. Sync.” \n“Dele Momodu is used to the “Leaders behaving badly” ways of leadership where deputies do not dare breathe without the permission of the Principal. I have no doubt that Dele Momodu runs his Corruption-friendly business empire that way. He decides alone and imposes on his staff.” \n“The difference between Buhari/Osinbajo and Jonathan/What’s his name, administrations is not only the anti and pro corruption. One is a team, the other wasn’t. While Nigerians are applauding the cohesive team spirit that exits between our President and our VP, Dele Momodu is using it to earn his keep from his corrupt friends. It’s common knowledge that under this administration, all businesses whose foundation was built on corruption, will collapse. Did I hear a loud OVATION?” \n“As an image maker and a friend of the corrupt especially of those who raped our nation, has Dele Momodu stopped to ask where his fees are coming from? Stolen funds? Dele Momodu must borrow some common sense from some of our youth who are educated and who know the meaning of “Team”. Here’s one from Japheth J Omojuwa. It’s not lost on Nigerians that Dele Momodu helped to encourage corruption by providing a platform for our corrupt nouveau rich to massage their corrupt ego.” \nDele Momodu has taken a stand for corruption. He must now understand that the respect that exists between our two leaders, is stronger than his love for the corrupt. Nigerians are learning again, that a President can delegate to the Vice so the benefit will go to Nigerians, not just to them. Dele Momodu can no longer hide his disdain for the war on corruption. But joining accidental Social Media practitioners in this way is to say the least, sickening!” \n“One thing is certain. Nigerians are learning from a credible team that great respect, friendship, collaboration and consultations are possible between workmates. Say “No’ To Dele Momodu’s divisive stance. It’s selfish, self-centred and egocentric. He alone, stands to gain. END. Thanks for retweeting.” \n“God bless Nigeria. God bless us, everyone.” \nNevertheless, in somewhat a team-up with Dele Momodu, former aide to Ex-President Goodluck Jonathan on electronic media, Reno Omokri joined the fray, advising the Ovation’s publisher to ignore the Buhari’s aide just like he(Omokri) ignored his (Momodu) attacks at his principal during the time ex-President Jonathan was in power. \nOmokri tweeted thus: “Egbon @ DeleMomodu , you shouldn’t have responded to that woman. She’s insulted me but I never respond to her. Responding is what she wants! Be guided by Proverbs 26:4 ‘Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be just like him.'” \n“What she wanted was to be associated with you in a fight. It brings you down and raises her up. Lose-lose for you, win for her. You egbon @ DeleMomodu , have met @ Mbuhari personally and one on one. I assure you she has not even enjoyed that privilege.” \n“The more you @ DeleMomodu respond to her and others of her ilk, the more they attack you to gain relevance. Just leave trash for LAWMA!” \nOmokri concluded with the tweet: 6-Egbon @DeleMomodu see the person you’re exchanging words with. Look at what influences her. Don’t go to her level! pic.twitter.com/4pNrdBr6wa \n— Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) 27 February 2017 \nBut Dele Momodu would not swallow the punch from Mrs. Onochie un-returned as he hit back at her saying a rude person like her can only represent government in a country where merit means nothing. \nHere is the full reply: \n“Good morning Madam. I’ve been flying so just reading your tirades and vituperations against me. You picked on a wrong customer.” \n“It takes a complete ignoramus to comment on an article he/she has not read or understood; when & where did I separate BUHARI/OSINBAJO?!” \n“I know you want to do what you’re paid to do but if sent on a slave errand you should behave like a freeborn and know how to join issues!” \n“I’m not a professional activist like you and so your opinion of me is complete fallacy; I freely supported Buhari bec PDP was no option! You did not have to hide behind one finger to attack me; I’m not a member of APC in order to maintain my freedom of speech & association!” \n“In my article, I praised Buhari for having a deputy like Osinbajo who obviously in our usual tradition couldn’t do what he’s doing now! I said parents would be proud of a child who’s upholding the family legacy; only mischief makers would get angry that I encouraged Osinbajo!” \n“In fact you are the one getting angry and separating BUHARI/OSINBAJO just because I said something positive is beginning to happen!What common-sense should I borrow from a rude person like you; where were you in 2015 when the GEJ guys attacked us like you’re doing now!” \n“Do you think I cannot advise BUHARI like I did to GEJ; my support was never a blank cheque and only a loyal friend will tell you the truth! Pls start; I’ve plenty of time for you today; a rude person like you can only represent govt in a country where merit means nothing!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:17:53.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
