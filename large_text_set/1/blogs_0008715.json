Ann was there, but not harmed. \n“I thought she was home, I can’t imagine her being there, through all this and the kids I can’t imagine what’s going to happen.” \nTerry was raised in Millville and had relocated to the Virginia Beach area before meeting his wife. The couple was in Florida en route to a Caribbean cruise. \nA loving father of two girls and proud grandfather to three, Terry was a 1972 graduate of Millville High School and always made it a point to attend class reunions, just as he always made a point to call his uncle to check in. \n“We just talked to him at Christmas-time, he calls all the time. He’s almost like one of my kids. \nAndreas worked for the Norfolk Naval Ship Yard, but back in his Millville teen years worked, helped out at his uncles contracting company. \n“I can’t say enough. I loved the kid every time we got off the phone he would say, ‘Uncle Dick, I love you.’” \nTerry would have turned 63 later this month.
