Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN) would fulfil all his electoral promises. \nThe APC reiterated this in a statement in Akure by its Publicity Secretary, Abayomi Adesanya. \nAdesanya promised prompt payment of workers’ salaries, job creation through industrialisation and agricultural revolution as well as peace and stability. \nReacting to the advice by the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) against creation of new local council development areas, Adesanya said: “Akeredolu will fulfill all electoral promises.” \nPDP had warned the governor against his proposal to create new local council development areas out of 18 local government areas promised during Akeredolu’s electioneering campaign. \nAdesanya stressed that there would be creation of local council development areas as promised by Akeredolu during campaign. \n“Contrary to what played out during the last administration, APC-Akeredolu is poised to steer the state’s affairs in the right direction and also deliver the true dividend of democracy to the good people of Ondo State,’’ he said \nAdesanya berated PDP for leaving behind a whooping debt of about N150 billion, eight months unpaid salaries of workers and several months of unpaid allowances and gratuities of pensioners. \n“What moral justification has Ondo-PDP leadership to advise APC-Akeredolu’s government?” \n“We view your advice as anti-developmental and evil against the people of the state. \n“It’s a clear attempt to derail our government so as to create bottleneck and distraction for Akeredolu. \n“The former government has no useful ingredient at its disposal to complement the efforts of this current administration,” he said. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:44:41.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
