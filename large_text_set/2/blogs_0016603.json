Being responsible citizens, Bollywood celebrities like Ranveer Singh , John Abraham , Shraddha Kapoor and Anushka Sharma also participated in the polls. However, Varun Dhawan couldn’t cast his vote today. Apparently, Varun’s name was missing from the voter list and hence he wasn’t allowed to cast his vote. Incidentally, his brother, filmmaker Rohit Dhawan, had his name on the list and was able to vote. \nTalking to ANI, a seemingly disappointed Varun revealed, “It is upsetting that I couldn’t find my name on the voter list. This year my name has not shown up on the list, unfortunately. It is bizarre because I voted last year. Will find out from EC where is my name.” The actor believes in exercising his right to vote and had actually flown in from Jaipur early in morning to participate in the BMC elections. Varun was in the Pink city to promote his upcoming film – Badrinath Ki Dulhania . \nEarlier in the day, it was reported that Paresh Rawal had also faced a similar issue. The actor and his wife, Swaroop Sampat, had stepped out early in the morning to cast their votes but upon reaching the polling centre, Paresh could not find his name on the voters’ list at that particular center. Last heard, he was all set to find out the centre where his name was registered in order to exercise his duty to vote.
