Such a big one ‚ù§Ô∏è\nA photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Jan 3, 2017 at 6:45am PST\nCalling out the often-patronising language used to celebrate women who are seen to rage against the status quo, simply by not being born supermodels, she says \"When my career started, some people celebrated my look but always through the lens of \"isn't she brave? Isn't it such a bold move to show THAT body on TV?\"\nShe continued: \"Well, today this body is on the cover of a magazine that millions of women will read, without photoshop, my thigh on full imperfect display.\"\nOkay, here goes: throughout my teens I was told, in no uncertain terms, that I was fucking funny looking. Potbelly, rabbit teeth, knock knees- I could never seem to get it right and it haunted my every move. I posed as the sassy confident one, secretly horrified and hurt by careless comments and hostility. Let's get something straight: I didn't hate what I looked like- I hated the culture that was telling me to hate it. When my career started, some people celebrated my look but always through the lens of \"isn't she brave? Isn't it such a bold move to show THAT body on TV?\" Then there were the legions of trolls who made high school teasing look like a damned joke with the violent threats they heaped on, the sickening insults that made me ache for teen girls like me who might be reading my comments. Well, today this body is on the cover of a magazine that millions of women will read, without photoshop, my thigh on full imperfect display. Whether you agree with my politics, like my show or connect to what I do, it doesn't matter- my body isn't fair game. No one's is, no matter their size, color, gender identity, and there's a place for us all in popular culture to be recognized as beautiful. Haters are gonna have to get more intellectual and creative with their disses in 2017 because none of us are going to be scared into muumuus by faceless basement dwellers, or cruel blogs, or even our partners and friends. Thank you to the women in Hollywood (and on Instagram!) leading the way, inspiring and normalizing the female form in EVERY form, and thank you to @glamourmag for letting my cellulite do the damn thing on news stands everywhere today ‚ù§Ô∏è Love you all.\nA photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Jan 3, 2017 at 9:00am PST\nIt shouldn't be a big deal to see a hint of cellulite on the front pages of a women's magazine in 2017, but unfortunately, it still is. For Dunham, it's a small victory worth celebrating.\n\"Thank you to the women in Hollywood (and on Instagram!) leading the way, inspiring and normalizing the female form in EVERY form, and thank you to @glamourmag for letting my cellulite do the damn thing on news stands everywhere today,\" she said.\nWhen they let you rock that Fenty gear with only a bra...
