Most of the time, you can’t be friends, so now try and imagine actually LIVING with your ex. That’s the situation Jess and Nick are still in on New Girl , and we’ve got to applaud them, they’re clear #ExGoals…even though we all secretly know these two are meant to be together and we are WAITING.\nFor the first time in a while, both Jess and Nick are in serious relationships. Jess is with the (near perfect in every way) Robbie and Nick is with the (falls asleep while reading fiction) Reagan. However, both feel like they’re subconsciously messing up their relationship, because they’re both a little too scared about getting ~serious~.\nThat’s when one ex looks to another ex for help. Good idea, or walking into a trap?\nFox Nick launches into a lil’ talk about how when things are good, they’re good, and that manes both he — and Jess! — freak out a little bit. He’s talking about their currently relationships, obviously…but he’s also touching on his history with Jess.\nJess even asks him, “Is that what happened with us?” AND OUR HEARTS.\nFox Nick follows up with joke, stating that he can’t even begin to figure out what happened between the two of them, and while these two then switch to talking about their current significant others, the signs are there. Clearly, there’s still a lot more left to discuss when it comes to the Jess and Nick dynamic, and we’ll be waiting right here to see where these two head next. Hopefully, it’s back to each other.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:11:47.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
