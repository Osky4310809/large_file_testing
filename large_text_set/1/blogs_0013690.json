The new John Cooper Works Countryman follows the same formula as other JCW-badged MINIs, which sees more power and a sportier setup. \nUnder the bonnet, there’s the same 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine used in the JCW Clubman , providing 231 hp and 350 Nm. MINI’s ALL4 all-wheel drive system is standard here, and buyers will get to choose either a six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed Steptronic auto. \nThose who pick the latter will also have access to a Launch Control function, allowing the JCW Countryman to sprint from zero to 100 km/h in just 6.5 seconds, the same as the manual version. However, the new time is 0.8 or 0.7 seconds quicker than the Cooper S Countryman ALL4. \nThe added power is accompanied by a sportier suspension setup, Brembo brakes and a standard MINI Driving Modes function with three settings to choose from – Sport, Mid and Green. MINI has also given the Countryman a few JCW-specific styling cues to differentiate it from the standard (and slower) car. \nOn the larger exterior, there’s a new honeycomb grille with the JCW logo nestled between LED headlamps, JCW Aerodynamics Kit with larger front air inlets and 18-inch John Cooper Works light alloy wheels in Black Thrill Spoke (19-inch optional). MINI also offers four non-metallic and six metallic body finishes to choose from, with Rebel Green being a JCW exclusive along with contrasting paint finishes for the roof and exterior mirror caps in Chili Red. \nInside, you’ll find plenty of JCW-specific fitments such as the sports seats, multifunction steering wheel and gear lever. In terms of equipment, there’s the MINI Visual Boost system, MINI Controller on the centre console and 6.5-inch screen. If that isn’t enough, you get plenty of optional extras like dual-zone climate control, a more feature-packed infotainment system, larger 8.8-inch screen and a Harman Kardon sound system.
