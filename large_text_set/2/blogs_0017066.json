Nakao committed the ADB’s support for the President’s socio-economic agenda. KRIZJOHN ROSALES \nMANILA, Philippines - The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is strongly committed to supporting the 10-point socioeconomic agenda set out by the Duterte administration. \nADB president Takehiko Nakao said the ADB has helped improve the lives of people since the bank was established in 1966. \nHe also cited the support from the Philippines as host country, and from partners within and outside the region. \nADB started operating in Manila on Dec. 19, 1966 with 31 members. \nAccording to Nakao, the Philippine capital has proven to be a good base for ADB’s headquarters because ADB is closer to its developing member countries. \nThe ADB benefited from the hospitality of the Philippine government and people, and can draw on a strong pool of English-speaking professionals, he added.   \nThe ADB has provided $16 billion in loans and grants to the government and about $1 billion in loans and equity investments to private companies. \nIn the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda in 2013, ADB provided $900 million for rebuilding the affected areas.
