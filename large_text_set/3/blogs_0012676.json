Both victims were taken to the hospital and listed in critical condition. MORE BREAKING… At least one person reported critically wounded. Shooting took place in an alley off 500 block of Broadway. \n— Ralph Iannotti (@IannottiRalph) March 16, 2017 \nThe landlord of an apartment building next to the crime scene said the wounded man was the son of one of his tenants. \nHe says that tenant told him about something that happened a couple of hours before the shooting that the landlord thinks may be most likely related to the double shooting. \nLisa Washington’s Report: \n“I got a phone call from one of my tenants around 6 o’clock, saying that her son had been mugged and his wallet and house keys were taken,” Tom Barnishin, the landlord, said. \nBarnishin said the woman was fearful that the people who took the keys would return and come into the building, and she wanted the locks replaced. \nNo suspects have been arrested. \nStay with KDKA for the latest on this developing story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T14:41:25.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
