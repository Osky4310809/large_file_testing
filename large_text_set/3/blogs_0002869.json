Scott Taylor's (Va.) feed suddenly cut out during an appearance Monday on CNN after he brought up refugees being involved in terrorist activities.\nTaylor was discussing with CNN correspondent Dana Bash the revised travel ban that President Trump signed that day, which restricts immigration from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the U.S. refugee program for 120 days, when his camera and microphone cut out.\nBash asked Taylor if he believes it is important for America's security to have such a ban in place.\n\"Just today, the FBI comes out and says that 30 percent, 30 percent, of their domestic terrorism cases that they're investigating are from folks who are refugees,\" Taylor said. \"It's important not to label all refugees bad people, that's not why I'm here, but –\"\nThe screen then cut to a colored multibar display, and a loud ping replaced Taylor's voice.\n\"I was just going to say, congressman, it's time to go, but I think the TV gremlins did that for us,” Bash responded while smiling.\nTaylor was referring to a Department of Homeland Security official saying Monday that 300 of the FBI's 1,000 FBI domestic terrorism cases involve those admitted to the U.S. as refugees.\nTaylor served as a Navy SEAL sniper in the Iraq War and currently serves on the House Appropriations Committee, including the Subcommittees on Homeland Security and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.\nThe post GOP Congressman’s CNN Feed Cuts Out When He Mentions Refugees Investigated for Terrorism appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:15:29.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
