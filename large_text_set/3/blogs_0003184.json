The 24-year-old singer took to Twitter on Sunday to thank fans for his Best Music Video win for \"Pillowtalk,\" which stars his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid. Zayn and the 21-year-old model are currently in France for Paris Fashion Week, and fittingly, Gigi made an appearance in Zayn's thank you video. \"I'm currently in Paris -- sorry I can't be there,\" Zayn tells his fans in the clip, shared via Twitter. \"A little birdie told me that I've actually won an award, so thank you very much. I'm very honored. To everyone that voted, it means a lot, and my co-star's actually sitting next to me right here, so she's gonna say hello as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T01:06:07.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
