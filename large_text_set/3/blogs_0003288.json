None of the victims’ identities have yet been released. \n“There was nothing we could have done different unfortunately. When we got on scene, the house was totally engulfed,” Fire Chief Ronald Gates said. A woman and four children died in a Warwick, Mass. fire. (WBZ-TV) \nThe cause of the fire was not yet known, but officials said it appeared to be accidental in nature. A wood stove is being eyed as a possible cause. \nAt least 16 fire departments from the area helped battle the blaze. \nWarwick is a town of just 800 people. \n“The community has suffered a great loss of life, a huge blow to our spirit that we’re only beginning to realize,” Town Coordinator David Young said. \nThe State Fire Marshal’s office said the total number of people killed by fire in Massachusetts this year now stands at 18. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
