One other person who weighed in with his opinion has been one of Trump’s harshest critics — former Mexican President Vicente Fox Quesada .\nFox took to Twitter to slam Trump, using some of Trump’s own insults against him.\nA \"so-called\" President is calling a real President and true leader: bad and sick guy. What a shame, America you need to do something now!\n— Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) March 4, 2017\n. @realDonaldTrump is more aware of what happens in reality TV than his own country. He's a very bad apprentice of politics!\n— Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) March 4, 2017\nThe ex-prez has taken numerous shots Trump in the past. He compared Trump to Fidel Castro following Castro’s death. He’s regularly used f-bombs while telling Trump that Mexico will not pay for the border wall. Fox has also referred to the president as a “hated gringo.”\n—\n ", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fvicente-fox-rips-so-called-president-trump-after-potus-claims-obama-tapped-his-phones%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "https://twitter.com/VicenteFoxQue/status/838086002489053184", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fvicente-fox-rips-so-called-president-trump-after-potus-claims-obama-tapped-his-phones%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/picmonkey_collage_-_vicente_fox.jpg&description=Vicente%20Fox%20Rips%20%26%238216%3BSo-Called%20President%26%238217%3B%20Trump%20After%20POTUS%20Claims%20Obama%20Tapped%20His%20Phones", "https://twitter.com/VicenteFoxQue/status/838086920857071618", "https://twitter.com/#!/justinbaragona"], "published": "2017-03-05T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:23:49.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
