If you forget something essential on a five day trip, you might not spend nearly half your trip without it, or have to spend much more for something you have sitting on your nightstand at home.\nAccording to Amazon, these are the 5 things travelers most frequently forget. Take a glance through the list and maybe pick up some extras and save yourself some angst if you, like one-third of your fellow Americans, plan on heading out of town in the near future.\nView As: One Page Slides Phone chargers Amazon It's the first thing we're going to mention, because it's one of the easiest things to forget when packing: a phone charging cable. Nearly everyone needs one, and with so much of our dependence moving online and into digital formats, having a working phone while we travel and while we vacation is non-negotiable.\nInstead of relying on my memory during the hectic period before embarking on a trip, I always keep a spare zipped into the front pocket of my suitcase.\nSyncwire iPhone Charger Lightning Cable, $8.99, available at Amazon Camera chargers and memory cards Amazon The whole purpose of bringing a camera on vacation is to help you or loved ones remember your trip, whether you're a few state lines away or visiting the Irish moors you've always meant to see in person.\nSo forgetting a memory card or a camera charger packs a significant punch. You can always find an overpriced SD Card at the airport, but having a spare in your suitcase will be something that you'll never regret.\nSanDisk Ultra Class 10 SDHC UHS-I Memory Card (32 GB), $12.95, available at Amazon Toothpaste Amazon It seems like many of the things we use everyday and rarely pay any attention to don't register on our radar when we're packing, either.\nOne of the most forgotten items is plain old toothpaste.\nIt pays to keep this in mind since essentials are often the items with the highest markups in destination spots, since retailers expect people to forget them.\nSince traveling seems to deliver everyone a little less fresh to their hotel door, odds are good brushing your teeth will be one of the first things you want to do.\nCrest 3D White Radiant Mint Whitening Toothpaste Twinpack, $5.71, available at Amazon Hairbrushes and combs Amazon Similar to toothpaste, hairbrushes are something that few of us really think about when packing. As a result, they often slip our minds as we load our suitcases.\nUnfortunately, this isn't a luxury item. If you plan to come into contact with wind, water, or don't sleep on your back, you're in store for some knotsâ€”especially if you're using the mini shampoo provided to you by the hotel.\nThis particular brush focuses on detangling hair for both adults and kids, so no matter the surf or the wind power you won't have to tug too hard.\nCrave Detangling Brush, $10.77, available at Amazon Swimsuits Amazon At best, you forgot to pack a swimsuit and found out the hotel has a pool. At worst, you're on a beach vacation and everyone else is heading to the ocean after check-in.\nNothing ruins the euphoria of a tropical destination like not being able to fully participate in the activities you've spent the last few weeks eagerly anticipating. Rather than having to go pick through the gift shop rack or miss a day in the water, it's a worthwhile idea to have one stockpiled.\nQuiksilver Waterman Men's Parker Volley, Moon Mist, XX-Large, $39.99, available at Amazon Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
