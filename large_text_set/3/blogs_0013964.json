It's gotta have some rock, some mid-range in there. \n\"No way, [I don't like it scooped]. When I was a kid, I would scoop everything, and then I'd play live with another guitarist, listen to recordings back and be like, 'You can't even hear my guitar. But I was louder than you, I have a full stack! \n\"They're like, 'That's because you don't have any mids. You gotta put the mids in there.' So I'm very conscious of the mids and not having the highs or bass turned up too loud.\" \nMastodon are set to release their new album \"Emperor of Sand\" on March 31. You can check out \"Andromeda\" - the track described as Bill's highlight on the album - in the embedded player below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:10:38.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
