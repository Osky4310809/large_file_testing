You can't make this stuff up. \nIsola says that he learned via source that a conference call could take place between the four principal characters (and probably their attorneys) on either Monday or Tuesday. \nDolan and Oakley have a longstanding tension which boiled over last week when Oakley was forcibly removed from a Knicks game and later arrested. Following the incident, Oakley denied any wrongdoing while Dolan banned him indefinitely from Madison Square Garden while insinuating that Oakley may be struggling with alcoholism. \nJordan was a teammate of Oakley's in Chicago and Washington and the two are reportedly close friends. Whether or not Jordan and Silver get involved, it's safe to say that everyone in New York is ready to put this mess behind them and concentrate on basketball -- especially since the Knicks just snapped a four-game losing streak by beating the Spurs on national television on Sunday.
