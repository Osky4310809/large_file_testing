Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIn a major victory for the Sunday Mirror’s campaign to scrap child burial fees, the Welsh government has announced the charges are to go. \nAlong with the Labour Party , we have been calling for an end to the unfair system that sees thousands of families a year hit with fees when they lose a child. \nAt Labour Party conference in Wales, leader Carwyn Jones said: “Today I am pleased to confirm that the welsh Labour Government will step in, and make sure that burial charges for children will no longer apply in Welsh communities.” \nHe also paid tribute to the “tenacious and dignified campaign” being fought by Labour Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris on funeral costs.
