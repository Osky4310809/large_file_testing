Some set off fireworks in the middle of Sproul Plaza. Others threw objects at UC police.\nAnd as the violence escalated, officers pulled back.\nWhen asked why police didn’t move in and stop the rioters, UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof replied, “Police tactics are driven on a campus by need, the non-negotiable need to protect our students and ensure their well being.”\nUniversity officials said police decided to stay back to prevent injuring innocent protesters and bystanders who could have been hurt if officers waded into the crowd.\nALSO READ: \nMan Arrested For Assaulting Trump Supporter Near UC Berkeley Campus President Trump Threatens UC-Berkeley Funding After Riot UC Berkeley Chancellor Blasts Violence Over Yiannopoulos Speech Riot Forces Cancellation Of Yiannopoulos Talk At UC Berkeley “In the context that we have had no reports of serious injuries, we are satisfied with the police department’s performance,” said Mogulof.\nThe protest caused more than $100,000 in damage to the UC Berkeley campus, not counting more than a dozen businesses that were\nvandalized in the city’s downtown area and Telegraph corridor, university officials said.\nDespite the destruction and violence, there was only one arrest by university police. City of Berkeley police, who monitored the demonstration once it left the university, said they made no arrests.\nUniversity police said that some members of the crowd were attacked by protesters and then rescued by police. UC police said there were\nsix reports of minor injuries.\nBerkeley police said once the protest moved into city streets, rioters vandalized 15 buildings. Again, police did not move to take the vandals into custody.\n“Our primary objective with the resources we had was the protection of life, said a Berkeley police spokesperson.\nRudra Reddy is with the Berkeley College Republicans, the group that invited Yiannopoulos to campus, sparking the outrage.\n“They tried their best, but what can you do when you have people throwing fire crackers at policemen? It’s just ridiculous,” said Reddy\nThe university allowed the event in the name of free speech. University officials said about 1,500 protesters remained peaceful.\nPresident Trump tweeted about the protest early Thursday morning, threatening to withhold funds from the school.\nIf U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view – NO FEDERAL FUNDS?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \n\n“It’s a bargaining chip he’s using right now,” said Reddy. “I think the president has used Twitter very effectively and i think he should continue to do so.”\nIn a statement Thursday morning, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin said, “Unfortunately, last night, a small minority of the protesters who had assembled in opposition to a speaking engagement featuring a prominent white nationalist engaged in violence and property damage.”\n“They also provided the ultra-nationalist far right exactly the images they want to use to try to discredit the vast majority of peaceful protesters in Berkeley and across America who are deeply concerned about where our country is headed,” Arreguin said.\nTM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
