And the sofa. And the bookshelves. On the Monday, January 30, episode of Counting On , Ben , Jessa , Joy , Jason and Spurgeon helped Jinger get Jeremy Vuolo 's apartment ready for his soon-to-be wife's arrival. As Jinger gathered her things to travel to Texas from Arkansas, she reflected on what the move would mean to her life. Mainly, she felt it was \"bittersweet\" because she couldn't wait to become Jeremy's bride, but she would be far from friends and family.

When she saw Jinger and Jeremy embrace upon arriving in Laredo, she added, \"Jinger and Jeremy are much more 'huggy' and affectionate, but to each their own.\" After he finished being all \"huggy\" with Jinger, Jeremy got busy unloading the 11 enormous suitcases the Duggar kids had brought along.

While there, they asked the doctor about a gag reflex Derick was having from exercise, eating and a bunch of other triggers. The doctor didn't have much to offer besides recommending Derick see a gastroenterologist (which he had already done). More alarming, however, was the doctor's discovery that one of Jill's arteries may have narrowed — this finding led him to recommend that she get a further workup to make sure nothing serious was going on. On the positive news side, Spurgeon was enormous for his age!

Duggars, Dillards, Vuolo's and Seewalds TLC \nA Woman's Touch \nSoon after beginning the process of furniture shopping and apartment decorating, it became clear to Jeremy that he wasn't going to have much (if any) input. Though he and Jinger were on the same page when it came to sticking to the budget, she wanted a \"light and bright\" color scheme, while Jeremy's taste was noticeably more masculine. After purchasing an apartment's worth of furniture, they carted it all back to the bachelor pad via a truck loaned by one of Jeremy's friends, who conveniently owned a moving company.
