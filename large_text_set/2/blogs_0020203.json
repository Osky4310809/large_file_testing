Covers media, tech, startups, culture and workplace trends. \nFor the second year, Entrepreneur partnered with CultureIQ to find the best office cultures in America. For more companies, tips and profiles, check out the rest of 2017's Top Company Cultures package. \nIf you ask the most successful founders about how to create an environment that inspires and supports employees, they will tell you that office perks like kegs and Ping Pong tables simply won’t cut it. \nInstead, a strong culture comes from empowering employees by focusing on a set of values embraced by the entire company. \nFor our Top Company Cultures list, a ranking highlighting the best cultures in the U.S., we talked with entrepreneurs from all over the country in industries as varied as real estate and web design. \nRelated: Why Office Perks Are Traps, Not Benefits \nDespite their different backgrounds and customer needs, the central tenets of the strong company culture were constant -- focusing on 10 pillars, including communication, support and collaboration. Drawing on these values, these companies were not only able to retain talent and increase productivity but also attract new hires to bring the company to new heights. \nFor those entrepreneurs looking to improve their culture, read on for some hard-won advice from the businesses featured on our Top Company Cultures list of 2017. \nThe answers were edited for brevity and clarity. 1 / 15 \nCompany: Co-founder and CEO of N2 Publishing Company size: Large-sized company (more than 100) Our No. 1 tip for building a strong culture: Remember that people have value. Everything boils down to that. They have value and need to be treated as such. Even if their viewpoints are different than yours, if you value and care about that person, they can buy into what you are building and you can build a relationship. If people think you are only pursuing your goals, then you can't build a culture that means anything. We have all kinds of backgrounds here, but we all appreciate and believe in each other and we’re all excited about the mission of the company. \nCompany: President of Fusion Medical Staffing Company size: Medium-sized company (50-99) Our No. 1 tip for building a strong culture: The most important thing for Scott Wehner, and I was figuring out how to build our team. Anytime that I have looked at anything I’ve done in life, I think about what the best team was and why that was the case. Having trust, open conflict and positive intent are all key. You’re in it together. \nIt is making sure you can tell someone to kick it into gear and they won’t take offense -- they’ll know that it is meant positively. \nOpen conflict is the ability to tell people what is on your mind and reasoning behind it. You don’t want assumptions to be made that aren't true. Be able to actively talk about it, and share your disagreements and opinions. It’s free flowing open dialogue. 3 / 15 \nCompany: Co-CEO and co-founder of Belay (formerly eaHelp) Company size: Small-sized company (under 50) Our No. 1 tip for building a strong culture: People want to work in a place where there is meaning. Leaders need to assume trust and give it them and connect the work to a meaningful why. \nCompany: Founder and CEO of KnowBe4 Company size: Large-sized company (more than 100) Our No. 1 tip for building a strong culture: My main successful action has been to be inclusive and don't treat your employees like mushrooms. \nCompany: CEO and Founder of Vanderbloeman Search Group Company size: Small-sized company (under 50) Our No. 1 tip for building a strong culture: Company culture starts with the people that you hire and how you hire them. We use our culture as a lens to decide who would join the company. \nSome of the mistakes we made were when we hired people who had a great track record but didn’t do things the way we do. For me, culture trumps competency every single time. \nI would rather have one person who needs to learn a skillset but matches culture than two who have the skills but don’t line up with the culture. Also, bonuses are tied to the culture. If you don’t match the culture, you’re not getting a bonus \nCompany: CEO of Procore Company size: Large-sized company (more than 100) Our No. 1 tip for building a strong culture: Culture is a reflection of the people who work at the company. As you start growing, you need to codify what your company has become as a culture. You come up with mission, vision and values. \nIf you aren’t hiring based on the values, you're going to get a hodgepodge of input to the culture, and it's going to degrade. \nOver time, you get a virtuous circle. You hire people who value what you value and share your vision, and as you scale and your brand becomes nationally recognized, you're able to attract people you would have never thought possible. But if you don’t put the framework in early enough you will muddy up who you are as a company. 7 / 15 \nCompany: Chief People Officer at Tuft and Needle Company size: Large-sized company (more than 100) Our No. 1 tip for building a strong culture: The mantra that we operate by is: you are your values and you are your people. \nA lot of times companies will say they want to stand for their core values, but you need to be careful about what you aspire to, compared to what you are. When you are aspirational, you end up with issues of hypocrisy. \nIf you look at case studies like Enron, their values were transparency and honesty and that didn’t help them because the people they hired held different values. \nWhat are the values that everyone collectively shares? As you add new members to the team do their values align with them? Be true to who you actually are. 8 / 15 Make the culture you are excited about \nName: Matt Rissell Company: CEO of TSheets Company size: Large-sized company (more than 100) Our No. 1 tip for building a strong culture: Culture has to come from whoever is leading the company. If there was a different CEO there would be different element of our culture. Most people make the mistake of creating the culture they think employees want to be a part of of. The problem with that is that you can’t make decisions consistent with that mantra. \nThe way that I built TSheets, I looked at it and thought, “Would I want to be a part of this atmosphere?” I can make decisions according to that mantra. That’s how we built it, from that concept. Do not replicate somebody else’s because the inauthenticity will eventually come through.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:13:57.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
