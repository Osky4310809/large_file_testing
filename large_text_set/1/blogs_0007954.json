As far as confirmation hearings go, it’s gonna be pretty gruesome. But in a wild twist, the most gruesome part day one was definitely this MTV “culture writer”… \n…firing off these tweets… \n…about this man and his BIOLOGICAL granddaughter… \nBusiness Insider : The child is Sessions’ biological granddaughter. His family had accompanied him to his confirmation hearing. \n\nReal, real unlucky break for this dude. I mean who the hell woulda guessed maybe-racisty Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions would have an ASIAN granddaughter? Shocking. Stunning. Besides researching it or googling it how the fuck would you know? Just impossible slash unlucky slash super agenda-driven to flat out say there’s NO REASON for Sessions to have a little Asian girl on his lap other than to say he’s not racist. Not even if said baby is his granddaughter and his family’s in town for the biggest thing of his life. \nJames Woods is pissed. I ask my 500,000 followers to join with all people of good conscience to boycott @MTV and its sponsors until #racist Ira Madison is fired. \n— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) January 10, 2017 \nSweet followers brag.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:22:42.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
