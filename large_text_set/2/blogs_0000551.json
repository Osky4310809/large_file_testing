There's also the yearly tradition of looking at Superb Owls .\nBut now we have the opportunity to get our Super Bowl weekends started right with the Bunny Bowl.\nSEE ALSO: 'Hamilton' will make a Super Bowl appearance \n\nImage: annie's homegrown\nThat's right. It's football with bunnies. Can. Things. Get. Cuter?\nThe Bunny Bowl is being put on by Annie's Homegrown and can be watched live on their Facebook page . All bunnies are mixed breeds from Rabbit Ears Rescue , a rescue committed to saving rabbits from shelters that are about to be euthanized.\nChristina Karem, spokesperson for Annie's, said that they were inspired by the Puppy Bowl. \"We wanted to give our awesome fans an hour of bunniesâ€¦being bunnies,\" Karem elaborated.\nWe cannot think of anything more worth watching than bunnies being bunnies.\nAll told, the Bunny Bowl will feature 11 magnificent bunnies, each vying for the coveted title of the COAT (Cutest of All Time).\n\nImage: annie's homegrown\nTeam Longears and Team Lops will be competing in a slow-paced, fluffy version of football this Friday. While it is a competition, there doesn't seem to be any real way that a winner will be determined. We were told that a standardized scoring system had been attempted at first, but it was quickly abandoned due to the fact that the players didn't seem to carrot all.\nSimilar to the Puppy Bowl, all bunnies playing in the Bunny Bowl are available for adoption. \n\nImage: annie's homegrown\n\nImage: Annie's homegrown\nThe Bunny Bowl will last an hour. Kick off is at 10 a.m. PST/ 1 p.m. EST this Friday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:20:31.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
