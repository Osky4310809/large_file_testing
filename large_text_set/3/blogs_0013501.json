The light has to pass through the water droplets at a low angle. This is why you see rainbows mainly late in the afternoon,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dave Samuhel said. \nRainbows \nRainbows are full circles, but spectators usually catch an arc from the ground. They are created by more than just rainwater from the sky, as they can also be created by water droplets from a sprinkler, splashing water or mist from a hose. \nEach tiny droplet of water disperses the light and reflects it back to your eye, creating the marvelous colors. \nTree and sun on lake sunrise.

The only exception to that order is when there is a double rainbow. \n\"Technically rainbows can occur anywhere as long as you have sunlight and raindrops,\" Samuhel said. \nThey are caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets, which usually creates the multicolored arc. \nSecondary rainbows \nIn a secondary rainbow, also known as a double rainbow, a second arc hovers above the first. The second arc has the order of its colors reversed. \nLight is reflected more than once inside of a raindrop. The second rainbow is almost twice as wide, but only about half as bright. The colors are backwards from right to left, which means they go from red to violet. \nDouble rainbow in the sky after the rain.

The longer second path leads to the secondary (double) bow, which has the color pattern flipped,\" said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Jim Andrews. \nFogbows \nFogbows, also known as white bows, are caused by much smaller rain droplets than normal rainbows; therefore, viewers may only see a faint red or blue color to them. Often times they just appear to be white, without any color to them at all. \n\"Fogbows are somewhat like rainbows. You might see one shortly after sunrise on a foggy morning,\" Andrews said. \nFog bow over the water.
