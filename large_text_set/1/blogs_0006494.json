According to a Facebook post by Manu Kumar Jain — Xiaomi India head — the company’s revenues in 2016 exceeded $1 billion. This is a new milestone for the Chinese manufacturer, which has been doing business in India for less than two years.\nManu Kumar Jain has also shared a few other interesting data in his post. He said that Xiaomi was one of the top three smartphone brands in the country in the third quarter of the year in terms of shipments. The company sold more than 2 million smartphones in Q3, which represents a 150 percent increase when compared with the same period in 2015.\nSee also: Xiaomi may be expanding into more global markets; here’s why that’s important 4 weeks ago He has also mentioned that the Redmi Note 3 was in high-demand in 2016, as the company sold 2.3 million units of the device in six months , making it the most sold smartphone online in India. The Redmi 3S as well as the Redmi 3S Prime were also quite popular among consumers and were, along with the Redmi Note 3, the top selling devices during Flipkart’s Big Billion Days and Amazon’s Great Indian Sale.\nBut these numbers don’t tell the whole story. Despite being popular in India, not everyone is happy with Xiaomi and its products. We have already reported that people have been complaining about poor after-sales support, lack of spare parts, and long wait times for getting devices serviced.\nThese are just a few of the things Xiaomi will have to work on if it wants to experience even more success not only in 2017 but also in the years to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T13:10:47.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
