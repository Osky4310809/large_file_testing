You've been cooking pasta all wrong Make spaghetti in under 10 minutes with this hack Saffron Alexander 14 March 2017 â€¢ 12:30pm \nM aking a bowl of spaghetti is a relatively quick and painless task to complete and, as such, has become the meal of choice for students and time pressed cooks. But one author is determined to simplify and speed up the process even further with an interesting food hack . \nHarold McGee, author of An Encyclopedia of Kitchen Science, History and Culture , suggests cooking pasta in pot of boiling water is unnecessary.

Five of the best pasta machines \n\"Because the water is cold the pasta won't stick to itself at the very beginning. When it's done, you have pasta that's perfectly cooked and you have a thickened liquid you can use to make all kinds of sauces.\" \nM cGee recommends putting the pasta in the frying pan before you pour between one and two litres of cold water over it. Then simply turn up the temperature to a medium-high heat and stir occasionally. \nA fter ten minutes you will, in theory, have a frying pan full of perfectly cooked pasta and just enough water leftover to make a sauce with. You also won't need to go anywhere near a colander, saving on washing up. \nS o, penne for your thoughts. Is the recipe genius, or has it made you so angry you've blown a fusilli?
