Collider today reports that Simon Kinberg is in talks with the studio to write and direct the next X-Men movie, rumored to be titled X-Men: Supernova .

Kinberg previously confirmed that the next X-Men movie would jump ahead ten years from Apocalypse , offering a 1990s setting. The X-Men comics saw a commercial boom during the 90s, following character redesigns by Jim Lee , which went on to be the basis for the fan-favorite animated series. \nCollider’s report reiterates the rumor that Supernova will take on the comics’ iconic “Dark Phoenix Saga” wherein Jean Grey, following exposure to radiation, begins to manifest immense cosmic power, ultimately transforming her into a powerful foe. An abbreviated take on the Dark Phoenix was depicted on the big screen in The Last Stand . \nThis next X-Men movie is being developed in addition to big screen X-Universe projects like Josh Boone ‘s New Mutants and Deadpool 2 and 3.
