The network will be part of the site LawNewz , a project by Court TV alum Dan Abrams.\nCourt TV is credited with making court cases and true crime a popular obsession. The network that had its heyday during the O.J. Simpson trial is ready for a follow-up in the age of Making a Murderer and O.J. Simpson documentaries.\nSEE ALSO: Will there be a season 2 of 'Making a Murderer'? Maybe.\n\"Court TV, by the end of its run, couldn't justify 24/7 coverage of live trials,\" Abrams told The Hollywood Reporter . \"But ... the internet is a different animal. A niche market is better suited for the web. We also don't have to do the numbers that a cable network has to do.\"\nThe legal streaming network is modeled after Cheddar TV , the business news platform that streams online. The LawNewz Network will air live from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and repeat its coverage overnight, THR said.\nA legal online network faces one problem Cheddar doesn't: cameras in courtrooms. Some judges allow cameras, but many still don't. Abrams said he plans to file motions to allow cameras in court, THR reported.\nThe network will launch with two upcoming court cases: the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez, which starts March 1, and the rape and assault trial of MMA fighter War Machine, beginning Feb. 27.\nBONUS: This innovative wind turbine can withstand hurricane-force winds", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/dan-abrams-launching-online-video-network-devoted-live-court-trials-979052?utm_source=twitter", "http://www.cheddar.com/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/DM33Dgqv.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/DM33Dgqv.m3u8", "http://lawnewz.com/"], "published": "2017-02-25T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:26:26.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
