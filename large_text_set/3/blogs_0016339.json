The Gendarmerie noted it was unclear why the man returned to the scene a second time (honestly, why? That whole \"never return to the scene of a crime\" warning clearly exists for a reason).\nFirefighters were called to the scene to free the man from his glass captor, and police said the robber would spend a few hours sleeping off his buzz in a \"drunk tank\" before being questioned.\nLet this be a timeless lesson to us all: if you have a big idea when you're drunk, sleep on it.\nWATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/rgQB8NjD.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/rgQB8NjD.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/Gendarmerie/status/843435717153964033", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThugLife?src=hash", "https://www.facebook.com/690331027724291/photos/a.690342387723155.1073741828.690331027724291/1328186993938688/?type=3", "https://t.co/mCmYICDuXs", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FallaitSeTenir%C3%80Carreau?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Maul%C3%A9on?src=hash"], "published": "2017-03-21T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:21:25.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
