Wasik Reed said about 2 feet of snow had fallen on the boy. Benjamin Wasik, 10, was found dead after snow collapsed on him while he was digging a tunnel in a pile of snow in Pendleton, N.Y. (Family Handout) \nBenjamin was taken to Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital where he was pronounced dead. His death has been ruled accidental and caused by asphyxiation, officials said. \nWasik Reed and her husband arrived at the hospital after Benjamin’s parents received the devastating news. Doctors “tried and tried, above and beyond,” to save her nephew, she said. \nThe incident is being investigated by the sheriff's office Criminal Investigation Bureau. \nThe Starpoint School District — where Benjamin was a fourth-grader at Regan Intermediate School — released a statement offering its condolences to the Wasik family and that crisis counseling was set up for students and faculty members. \nFuneral services for Benjamin will be held this Sunday in Lockport, his aunt said.
