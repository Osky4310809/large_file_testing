Upon first glance, it certainly appears to be a carbon copy of the Sport Coupe Concept GTE that previewed it during the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. \nBased on the front angle shot provided, there are a few minor changes from concept to production form . While the LED headlamps (with DRLs) continue to blend into the multi-slat grille, the bonnet has abandoned the aggressive cue seen above the car’s front lighting units. \nAs for the rear (don’t say Mercedes C-Class Coupe ), we get to see the fastback design that is again, very similar to the Geneva concept, including the two-piece taillights and large rear window. The top of the boot protrudes less in this instance, and it also appears to get a small lip spoiler. A prominent line between the car’s beltline and door handles are clearly seen her as well. \nDespite what should be a stunning shape, Volkswagen says the Arteon’s interior is “exceptionally generously spacious” with plenty of room for heads and legs. It also adds that the premium mid-size sedan will get the latest generation of driver assistance systems. \nNo word on what lies under the hood but the usual array of TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines should be offered. The car will utilise the Volkswagen Group’s MQB platform, opening up the possibility of a hybrid solution. \nOn the Sport Coupe Concept GTE, a V6 TSI engine along with two electric motors offered a total system output of 380 hp. In terms of performance, Volkswagen at the time, claimed a range of up to 1,000 km, a 50 km pure electric range and a 0-100 km/h time of 5.2 seconds. \nGALLERY: Volkswagen Arteon prototype", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:02:05.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
