Hazard believes that his side's post-Euro 2016 success is down to both experience and a new system introduced under their former Everton manager. \n\"Yes, he changed things. It changed him also, we can play different systems now,\" Hazard told Goal . \"We now play with three defenders. A little bit like Chelsea, also the same, and we are playing very well. \n\"We have won every game at the moment. I hope it will continue like this. It is an important game against Greece. I think Greece is second and we are first. I am happy that I can go with this team. \n\"It is true that it is the best team for a long time and to play with this team is good for me, to play with these players and train with these players. I can also learn [on international duty], but first we need to qualify. \n\"We know from the last European Championship, it is not easy to get to the finals. You need to play well, be lucky, avoid injury so it is dependent on a lot of things so we will see. \nChelsea's top five teenage stars \nMartinez has made a positive impact with Belgium after succeeding Marc Wilmots - who gets back into work this week with the Ivory Coast. \nHazard thinks that Belgium will be better equipped for a possible major finals appearance in Russia than they were in Brazil and France due to the experience their young side has since gained. \n\"Yes, I think the team also learned from the World Cup in Brazil and the European Championship in France,\" He added. \"I think it was a very young team in Brazil and France. We know the players now have more experience. \n\"Eden will be 27-years-old when the team plays in Russia and we will all be more experienced with the international level of competition. I think it is good for the team and it can help every player - who now all play at a high level in good leagues. We will be ready for Russia.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:49:08.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
