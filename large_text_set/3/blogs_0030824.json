His newly-confirmed victims were aged 17 to 38, according to law enforcement sources. Popkov's murderous spree lasted from 1992 to 2010 (Photo: East 2 West) \nIn leaked testimony from the macabre case, he described to criminal investigators how he separated his \"ordinary\" family life from his other existence as one of history's worst and most bloodthirsty serial killers using axes, knives and screwdrivers to murder his victims \"I had a double life,\" he told investigators working on his case. One of his victims is pictured sprawled in the snow (Photo: East 2 West) His wife Elena knew nothing of his barbaric crimes (Photo: East 2 West) Popkov says his wife and daughter considered him a good dad (Photo: East 2 West) \n\"In one life I was an ordinary person, I was in the service in the police, having positive feedback on my work.

My wife and daughter considered me a good husband and father, which corresponded to reality. \n\"In my other life I committed murders, which I carefully concealed from everyone, realising that this was a criminal offence. \n\"My wife and daughter never knew about the crimes I committed and did not even suspect this.\" Popkov during his 18 year reign of terror (Photo: East 2 West) \nHe coldly revealed how he cruelly selected women to kill during his 18-year reign of terror in Irkutsk region between 1992 and 2010. Daughter Katya has started a new life in a different city (Photo: East 2 West) \n\"The victims were those who, unaccompanied by men, at night, without a certain purpose, were on the streets, behaving carelessly, who were not afraid to enter into conversation with me, get into my car, and then go for a drive in search of adventures, for the sake of entertainment, ready to drink alcohol and have sexual intercourse with me.\" \nHe used his police car, offering lifts to some victims, then taking them to remote areas to rape and murder them. Popkov with his daughter as a child (Photo: East 2 West) \nInvestigators never believed a policeman could be responsible for such crimes. \n\"Not all women became victims, but those of a certain negative behaviour, I had a desire to teach and punish,\" he said of his decision who would live and die. \n\"Others did not behave in such a way, they were afraid ... \n\"The exception was the murder of (victim) Elena Dorogova, who was hurrying to the [railway] station to meet her mother. On this occasion, the woman was sober.\" \nHe raided the police station's store of weapons confiscated from criminals to use for his own murders, he admitted in testimony to criminal investigators. \n\"I had the opportunity then to take them,\" he said. Marina Chetverikova found dead in the snow (Photo: East 2 West) \n\"Then I threw them away either at the crime scene or nearby, wiping them with something to remove my fingerprints ... \n\"The choice of weapons for killing was always casual. Victim Maria Lyzhina (Photo: East 2 West) \n\"I never prepared beforehand to commit a murder, I could use any object that was in the car - a knife, an axe, a bat. \n\"I never used rope for strangulation, and I did not have a firearm either. I did not cut out the hearts of the victims.\" Police identity token that he accidentally left at one scene (Photo: East 2 West) \nOn one occasion he murdered a teacher at his daughter Katya's music school, he said. \n\"Her corpse was found in the forest along with the body of another woman,' he said. \n\"My daughter asked me to give her money, because the school was collecting to organise funerals. I gave her.\" The music teacher whose funeral Popkov helped pay for (Photo: East 2 West) Read More Russia's worst-ever serial killer 'The Werewolf' finally admits he murdered EIGHTY-ONE women \nOnce he went back to the crime scene after leaving two women for dead, because he realised he had lost a police identity token at the site, which would identify him as the serial killer. \n\"I found the token right away, but saw that one of the women was still breathing,\" he said. \n\"I was again shocked by the fact that she was still alive. I finished her with a shovel.\" \nThese victims in the year 2000 were Maria Lyzhina, 35 and Liliya Pashkovskaya, 37. \nThe killer has been judged mentally fit to stand trial.
