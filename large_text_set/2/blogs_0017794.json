BT will have two games on Saturday, while the BBC will have one each on Sunday and Monday. With Chelsea’s tie against Manchester United the obvious glamour tie of the round, it’s unsurprising that we were picked for the Monday night slot . This choice also falls in line with Chelsea’s existing schedule — the Blues were due to play Watford that night already in the Premier League, a match the will have to be rescheduled — and works out for United, who will have Europa League Round of 16 legs to play both the Thursday before and the Thursday after. How well it works out for them will be seen later this week when the draw is made (three days off before but only two days rest after the match with Chelsea, so they’d no doubt prefer the home leg to come second). In any case, here’s the full schedule for the FA Cup quartefinals: Saturday, March 11 12.30: Middlesbrough vs. Manchester City OR Huddersfield Town (BT Sport 2)17.30: Arsenal vs. Lincoln City (BT Sport 2) Sunday, March 12 14.00: Tottenham Hotspur vs. Millwall (BBC 1) Monday, March 13 19.45: Chelsea vs. Manchester United (BBC 1) More From We Ain't Got No History", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:25:55.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
