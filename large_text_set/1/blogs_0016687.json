Looking at the recently released inactive report for Sunday’s playoff game, we find a number of players who are struggling to recover from some long-term injuries and have failed to take any meaning part in practice for several weeks.\nInactives for @Steelers : QB Mettenberger, CB Shabazz, RB Toussaint, 56 LB Chickillo, T Mihalik, TE Green, DE Mathews\n— Bob Labriola (@BobLabriola) January 15, 2017 \nRelated: Keys to Steelers offense vs. Chiefs in AFC divisional playoff \nBrian Mihalik (Healthy scratch) Zach Mettenberger (Healthy scratch) Al-Hajj Shabazz (Healthy scratch) Fitzgerald Toussaint (Concussion) Ladarius Green (Concussion) Ricardo Mathews (Ankle) Anthony Chickillo (Ankle) Once again Ladarius Green will remain on the sideline as he misses his fourth game in a row dealing with the concussion he suffered against the Bengals in Week 15. In light of the issues he had with head traumas in the past, there is every chance Green could be done for the year, even if Pittsburgh goes all the way to the Super Bowl.\nAfter suffering a concussion of his own last week, it is no surprise to see Fitzgerald Toussaint ruled out for the Chiefs game too and he will join Anthony Chickillo as a spectator this weekend. Having been the only player previously declared out before the weekend, Chickillo will miss his third consecutive game.\nRelated: Keys to Steelers offense vs. Chiefs in AFC divisional playoff \nWhile there had been some hope Ricardo Mathews may make it back this Sunday, unfortunately, he rounds out the list of injured players still unable to play. None of the four names from the Friday report have been deemed healthy enough to go in Kansas City and in some ways, Mathews might be the biggest loss.\nRounding out the group of inactives are Zach Mettenberger, Brian Mihalik, and Al-Hajj Shabazz, names that are more than familiar with the inactive tag on gameday.\nOf the players who were held out for the wild-card game due to injury, only Robert Golden will suit up against the Chiefs. Considering the concerns over kick returner Tyreek Hill, the Steelers special teams captain has returned at just the right time.\nRelated: Steelers Wire Pregame Podcast: Tim Benz breaks down the divisional playoffs ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T01:56:33.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
