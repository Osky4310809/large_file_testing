Four days before Kim Jong Nam was killed at a Malaysian airport, she appears to have posted a picture of herself wearing a shirt emblazoned with the acronym \"LOL\", similar to the one on the fleeing suspect caught on CCTV cameras. \nThe latest picture of Huong to emerge shows her posing in a flowery white bikini and twirling her hair flirtatiously. It is understood she was working at a motor show in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Fifty six of the friends are men. \nHer profile picture shows Huong wearing a red cut-out swimsuit at a pool. Other photos are selfies taken in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a few days before Kim Jong Nam was attacked at the city's airport by two women who rubbed his face with apparent poison. The Facebook page of Doan Thi Huong, under the alias 'Ruby Ruby' \nM alaysian police have said Huong and an Indonesian woman wiped a liquid, containing a toxic substance, now believed to be VX nerve agent - a chemical weapon - on Kim Jong-nam's face at Kuala Lumpur's budget air terminal on February 13. \nThe estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un died soon afterwards. \nHuong was described by police as an \"entertainment outlet employee\", but they did not give details of where she had been employed or what her immigration status was.
