( TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk seems to be all over the news. When he is not conferring with President Donald Trump about the nation's economy, Musk is launching rockets and fighting worker unions at his manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif. Whatever his faults, at least one cannot fault him for living a boring life. \nOr, maybe he does. (See also: Is Elon Musk Starting a Boring Company? ) \nIn an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Musk has revealed more details about The Boring Company, his newest venture, which consists of digging tunnels underneath the ground to reduce traffic congestion. Musk has already dug a pit 15 feet deep and more than 50 feet wide at his SpaceX headquarters in Los Angeles to test his idea. As he has explained earlier, his intention is to develop a 3D transportation network, one that incorporates a Y-axis or height (or depth) to the existing length and breadth of paved streets. This underground network could have \"as many as\" 30 levels of tunnels for cars and public transit systems, such as the hyperloop. (See also: How Elon Musk Will Revolutionize the Modern World .) \nOne could, of course, argue that going up might be cheaper and less time consuming. But Musk says that flying cars, which are being championed by Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ) chairman Larry Page, are a \"dumb idea\" because they are not scalable and require enormous downward force to keep them in the air. The latter translates into wind, noise and debris for those on the ground. (See also: How Flying Cars Could Land in Your Portflolio .) \nInstead, Musk's immediate aim is to build a fast and cheap tunneling machine. According to him, tunneling costs a billion dollars a mile and takes enormous time and effort. As an example, he cites the City of Los Angeles' extension of its subway line, which will cost $2.4 billion for an extension of 2.6 miles and take approximately 10 years. Musk wants to develop tunneling machines that make it possible to drill a mile a week. He plans to do this by accomplishing three tasks: feeding the machine with more power, constructing it with better materials, and developing a design that enables it to dig and install tunnel walls at the same time. \nAs they have done with the electric car industry, Musk's improvements could also have a transformative effect on the economics of tunneling. The article states that new machines cost $15 million on average; however, China's recent construction boom has driven down costs. They could become even more cheap if Musk's idea takes off, because it would translate into a proliferation of public transit systems that use tunneling.

Musk has not recruited full-time employees to his venture and does not have a business model right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:49:44.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
