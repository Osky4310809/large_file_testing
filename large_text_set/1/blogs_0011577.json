He compared China’s actions to those of Russia in the Crimea. \nAn explainer on the territorial disputes simmering around China \nChina claims more than 80 percent of the South China Sea, where it has constructed artificial land features on seven rocks and reefs, and installed military facilities. Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also claim parts of the same area, through which more than $5 trillion of trade passes each year. \nA satellite image of the Fiery Cross Reef located in the South China Sea.
