Sigh. It‚Äôs impossible to put into words just how much we miss these two. As you might recall, to soften the blow from their departure, the internet decided to commemorate their sweet friendship with dozens of memes that we can look at wistfully from time to time when we‚Äôre feeling sad. While Obama once acknowledged the internet‚Äôs obsession with their ‚Äúbromance‚Äù in a speech, the ex-VP hasn‚Äôt said much about it ‚Äî until now. Apparently, Biden LOVED the memes and even has a favorite! Yee!\nIn a recent interview with Moneyish, Biden‚Äôs daughter, Ashley, said that she was the one who introduced her father to the delightful memes . His reaction? He ‚Äúsat there for an hour and laughed.‚Äù\nYass!\n#joebiden #barackobama #presidentobama #vicepresident #meme #memes \nA post shared by ü§óBOOB SQUEEZEü§ó (@fobomemeations) on Mar 14, 2017 at 12:52am PDT \nAnd his favorite? It‚Äôs this heart-warming meme about Joe wanting to keep their relationship going strong after the presidency. \"See?
