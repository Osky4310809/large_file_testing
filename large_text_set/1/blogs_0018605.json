She’s also a total inspiration for the 14.7 thousand followers she’s attracted on Instagram by posting candid photos of her fitness journey. Hers is an incredible story of turning lemons into lemonade. The real estate business had been slow, Moore tells Yahoo Beauty, so she started spending more time at the gym, where her boyfriend, Kevin Johnson, is a personal trainer. Then a lightbulb went off. “We decided since I’m at the gym everyday that I could you utilize my time better by training clients.” So Moore started chronicling her workouts — and her results — on her Instagram account. And then she kept going. Now she’s become a personal trainer herself and is training to compete in the NPC Kentucky Derby Championship on April 29. The seed was planted in Moore’s head one day in March 2015. “I went to the Arnold classic bodybuilding show, and I [saw] how fit and muscular all the bodybuilders were. It motivated me to come back home and get [focused] on my goal. And it has been a long journey!,” she enthusiastically tells Yahoo Beauty.

Her posts include such motivational messages as, “ Just a little Saturday motivation. Consistency is the key. Stay tuned as I will be turning up & SHREDDING in the next couple weeks. Work hard, play hard!!!”. She also explains in helpful detail exactly how she does her workouts. “I have a full beginner video that I posted recently for those who are curious too see what movements to do for core in the gym or at home,” she writes in one post. According to its website , the 2017 NPC Derby Festival Championships is a “fitness, figure, swimwear and bodybuilding competition featuring amateurs and pro athletes from across the country.” Moore is anticipating the event as a challenging new step in her bodybuilding quest. When Yahoo Beauty asked her if she’s encountered any obstacles, though, she revealed the depth of her dedication, saying, “Right now I don’t have any obstacles, I’ve gotten rid of all my excuses.” Some things really are just mind over matter.
