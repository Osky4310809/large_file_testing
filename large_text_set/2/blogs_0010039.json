And sing she did. Beyoncé's Grammys 2017 performance was quite possibly the best moment of show (and, as we said before, the most anticipated). And we spoke with her makeup artist, Sir John—who not only prettified Beyoncé, but the entire cast of dancers—exclusively to get all of the details on the epic performance. Her clothing was the main inspiration for the look of the show. Designed by Peter Dundas (the guy who used to be creative director at Emilio Pucci, and before that, the creative director at Roberto Cavalli), Bey's gilded ensemble struck a major chord with Sir John. \"It's very ornate, and almost reminds me of the Byzantine Hall at the Met Museum,\" he said. Sir John used touches of gold throughout the makeup—on the lids, on the cheekbones, and down the dancers' faces (more on that in a second).

That meant matte brown smoky eyes (using shades from the L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche La Palette Nude) with a touch of gold pigment ( L'Oréal Paris Infallible Paints Eyeshadow in Nude Fishnet) on the center of the lids and along the tear ducts to \"give it more of a 3D effect.\" (Before she went on, he added a layer of clear balm to really bump up the gleam.) She wore two layers of highlighter. To really dial up the shine, Sir John first mixed a drop of L'Oréal Paris True Match Liquid Lumi Illuminator in Golden into foundation (he used L'Oréal Paris Infallible Pro Glow Foundation). But he didn't stop there. He tapped the shimmery gold cream along Bey's cheekbones and then topped that with a dusting of gold powder eye shadow (L'Oréal Paris Infallible 24HR Eyeshadow in Eternal Sunshine). You've probably seen the lipsticks she was wearing on Instagram. Sir John mixed two shades of Matte Liquid Lipstick from Dose of Colors —Cork and Chocolate Wasted—using the latter to contour the shape of the lip in lieu of lip liner. \"I like to line the lips with a liquid matte formula because it lasts longer than lip liner.\" As for why he chose the Instagram-famous brand ? \"Anna, the founder, is a friend of mine and I love how she started with a following on social media and now has this massive company.\" Getty Images She was literally covered in gold. \"She's already has that pregnancy glow, but we just wanted to enhance that even more,\" said Sir John. That meant creating his own DIY body luminizer. \"Empty some body lotion into a paper cup and squirt of bit of the gold and rose gold L'Oréal Paris Liquid Lumi Illuminators in there and mix it up with a plastic knife. Then smear that all over you body and wait a few minutes for it to dry. Once it does, it becomes becomes practically transfer resistant.\" Sir John handmade all those gold decals worn by Bey and the dancers. To give the dancers' makeup a more modern feel—and to bring the feeling of Lemonade full circle—Sir John cut gold vinyl paper into strips that he glued onto the dancers' faces with wig glue. And in the video that played throughout Beyoncé's Grammys performance, you can see Bey and Blue Ivy wearing the same gold adornments. \"I think it speaks to where we are now,\" said Sir John. \"I think back to when we were doing Lemonade and I thought, No one is ever going to copy this makeup we're doing, but then I went to parties and festivals and at every concert we did around the world, girls were showing up wearing those dots that we did.\" Look back at the most shocking Grammys looks of all time: #", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:48:39.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
