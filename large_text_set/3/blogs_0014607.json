U.S. Soccer confirmed Friday that coach Bruce Arena dropped Johnson from the roster and Zusi was named as his replacement. \nZusi joins the USMNT roster being listed as a defender, which means Arena may not be looking for a like-for-like replacement – but Zusi still offers some of the same versatility of Johnson. Although Johnson often played as a left back for the USMNT by coach Jurgen Klinsmann, Arena has said he sees Johnson playing in the wide midfield where he plays for his club. Zusi, meanwhile, has spent his career as a midfield winger, but Arena tested him at a fullback spot in January based on similar experiments at Sporting Kansas City. \nBoth Zusi and Johnson can switch between the midfield and the back line, although Zusi is much newer and less tested defensively. The Americans are lacking depth at fullback, however, due to the injuries of DeAndre Yedlin and Eric Lichaj, along with the suspension of Timmy Chandler. \nWhile Arena had plenty of in-form winger options he could’ve called in , Arena’s decision to call Zusi hints not just at a need for defensive depth, but at a preference for more USMNT experience. Zusi has featured for the Americans in his share of World Cup qualifiers over the years — he has almost 50 caps with the USMNT, 15 of them during World Cup qualifiers. \nThe USMNT is in need of a win after losing their first two matches of the final round of World Cup qualifying. They face Honduras on March 24 at 10:30 p.m. ET on FS1.
