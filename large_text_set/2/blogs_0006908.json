The statement said the hacking attempt was unsuccessful and stressed that “it appeared there were no terrorist motives” for the cyber attacks. \nThe statement goes on to say the teen “is not radicalized” and that he told himself it was “the right time to carry out the attack.” \nBelgian authorities have been on high alert since suicide bombers attacked the Brussels airport and subway system last March 22. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
