Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nCoronation Street’s new heartthrob Rob Mallard watched old episodes to help model his character on soap charmer Ken Barlow – and it paid off, as he has actor Bill Roache ’s seal of approval. \nRob plays Ken’s son Daniel Osbourne, who slept with Sinead Tinker in the Street’s knicker factory last week, starting a passionate relationship behind her boyfriend’s back. \nDaniel is now tipped to replace Ken, who famously fought with love rival Mike Baldwin, as Corrie ’s womaniser. \nRob, 25, says: “When I got the part I went back and watched a lot of the old clips of Bill as Ken, especially ones of him fighting. There’s lots of those. \n“I wanted to see how Ken considered himself not as posh, but above the rest of the people around him, the anger he had in him and also the way he wooed women back in the day.” Read More Ken and Deirdre (Photo: ITV) \nBut there were some features Rob did not need to work on. \nHe says: “In the description of the character, it did say Daniel was a young Ken Barlow. It was only after getting the job that people started saying that I looked like him back in the day. \n“I’ve had people write to me saying they can see the comparisons to the way Bill was in the early 1970s. The hair definitely has something to do with it, and the way Daniel dresses. \n“Bill can see it, too. He brought an old picture of himself into make-up one morning and went round showing it to everyone, saying he couldn’t believe how closely we resemble each other. He loves it.” Ken Barlow (actor William Roache) hitting Mike Baldwin (actor Johnny Briggs) \nOff screen, Bill has been showing the actor the ropes on the Street. \nRob says: “I brought my grandma in the other week, she started blushing as Bill was leaning on the side all smooth. I’m like, ‘There’s the old Ken, he hasn’t gone anywhere’. \n“He’s also always told me to make sure I learn my lines, as the volume of what we say can often be overwhelming, so you end up not having a proper grasp of what you’re saying. \n“I don’t feel pressure to emulate him, but I do feel pressure to not ruin the Barlows’ dynamic or legacy.

I didn’t want to come in, do my thing and it not to work.” \nSince the character’s return to the soap in November with his nephew Adam – Daniel last appeared on the soap as a child, but played by different actors – he has made quite an impact. \nDaniel took just a couple of months to make his move on Sinead ( Katie McGlynn \n), who was with Chesney Brown, and the pair will move in together. Rumours are rife she will then get pregnant. \nThough Rob says: “I’d like Daniel to be a womaniser like Ken, but not just a bed hopper. Even though Ken has cheated and slept around a lot, women still find him attractive. \n“The same goes for [Daniel’s half-brother] Peter, he’s a bigamist and all sorts but women forgive him. Girls love a bad boy. There’s something about the Barlow boys that women forgive. Ken Barlow was the original street lothario (Photo: Mirrorpix) \n“So I don’t want him to be a bed hopper as such, but I definitely want him to have more experiences in that department. Sinead is his first sexual partner, but most people don’t stay with their first.” \nHe adds of the character’s relationship with his father: “Ken had a stable upbringing, went to university and then came home and had ideas above his station. \n\"Daniel didn’t do that. He’s been on his own since he was 14. Ken’s trying to correct his life mistakes by planning Daniel’s life for him. He doesn’t see their differences, only their similarities.” \nRob began filming passionate scenes with actress Katie before Christmas, but insists they don’t faze him. Which is good news if he plans to stay in the soap and woo woman after woman. \nThough he says of the scenes: “I don’t run into them going, ‘Yes! I get to kiss Katie’, because I am aware that while I might not have a problem with it, Katie may. Daniel Osbourne is back on the cobbles (Photo: ITV) \n“We agreed to keep the kissing for when the cameras were rolling, so we never did it in rehearsals. \n“That was more my idea, I’ve had five colds since I started here so I didn’t want to pass on the germs to her.” \nHe adds: “I always joked that I should have it written into my contract that I never have to do a topless scene; let’s not subject the nation to that. \n“I think it’s more a novelty to keep your clothes on these days. The great thing about Daniel is he’s not a sexy character, he doesn’t rely on his looks.” \nOff screen, Rob is openly gay and told Gay Times earlier this month his family were “nonplussed” by him coming out. Dan and Chesney come to blows (Photo: ITV) \nBut dating as an actor can be tricky. Rob says: “When I’ve been out with cast members before I was on screen, I would watch to see how they dealt with people coming up to them in bars. \n“People who have dealt with it for years just take control of the situation, but there’s an immediate barrier that goes up when people come up to meet you. \n“However many people watch the show, they don’t all walk around with a sticker on that says I Love Corrie. So when you’re out, everyone is a potential fan of the show. \n“It makes you think that everyone is going to recognise you, that you’re more famous than you are. And you have to be careful now everyone has camera phones.” Though he jokes: “I’m fortunate in that my days of falling asleep in a club are over.” Coronation Street continues on ITV tomorrow at 7.30pm and 8.30pm.
