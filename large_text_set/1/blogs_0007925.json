The Colonel stopped by DXHQ to provide an update on the Tank’s slew of new projects and business ventures. The No Limit Boys’ We All We Got will be available on January 6, 2017. Master Ps branded Louisiana Hot Sauce and Sugar Skull Rum are both currently available. \nSpeaking with Justin Hunte , Mr. Percy Miller also tackled the recent beef between Soulja Boy and Chris Brown and provided some advice. \n“I think it’s going to be hard because this is not a time for that,” he said. “A lot of people die, we have police brutality and a lot of these artists now can’t even move the way they need to move because it’s so much conflict and so much beef. I just don’t entertain it to be honest with you. I come from a different millennium where we’re just different. I feel like if something happens to any one of these guys, it’s a waste of talent. I would hate to see that. So, I’m definitely praying for them and hope this blows over.” \nThe No Limit captain hopes both will eventually find peace and change the individuals they surround themselves with. \n“I wish both of these guys the best and I feel like they need some good people around them to make sure that they know that this stuff is serious,” he said. “It’s just not about you. It goes so far and goes viral even in real life. It makes other people feel like they have to represent or be about it and it shouldn’t be like that. I think we should be having fun and making music. We’re making money and should be happy. It should be a happy time. For me, 2017 is a happy time. Let’s get out of that because a lot of young artists don’t live to grow up. Tupac and Biggie Smalls died so young.” \nExpect a trio of projects to come from the No Limit Forever in 2017. This includes the aforementioned No Limit Boys project set for release January 6. Plus, Marques Clae’s The Ghetto Poet arrives on January 9 and Ace B’s Ace Of Spades on February 6.
