Craze Productions, the company responsible, doesn’t own any of the rights to Aaliyah’s music, although that didn’t stop them from doing the same thing in 2013, which ultimately led to a lawsuit and the removal of the songs. \nBarry Hankerson, Aaliyah’s uncle and former manager, does not want her back catalog to be released digitally, according to Complex . Similarly, the company that does hold the rights to Aaliyah’s music has also put paid to the idea that Aaliyah’s music was supposed to go up. \nRell Lafargue, the COO of Reservoir Media told Complex, “Our lawyers are handling it.
