When the Halos told him they wanted to try him as a starter this spring, he figured they'd give him two outings before moving him back to the bullpen. \nBut on Tuesday, Ramirez took the mound and pitched five innings in a game for the first time since 2011, allowing one run on four hits and striking out six in the Angels' 9-1 win over the Reds at Goodyear Ballpark. Full Game Coverage \n\"Everything was working,\" Ramirez said. \"My sinker was down. My curveball was really nice. My slider was almost good. I'm trying to keep myself in the fight for the spot.\" \nManager Mike Scioscia acknowledged afterward that Ramirez remains in contention for a spot in the Angels' rotation, though he declined to reveal who else is still in the mix. \n\"We're not going to handicap this thing,\" Scioscia said. \"You guys see who's there and who's throwing the ball well. I think there's a number of guys that are going to have an opportunity to win a spot.\" \nGarrett Richards , Matt Shoemaker and Ricky Nolasco appear to be locks for the Angels' starting rotation, but it's unclear who will fill the other two spots. There's still some question as to whether Tyler Skaggs , who missed a spring start with shoulder weakness, will be ready for the start of the season. Jesse Chavez , Alex Meyer and Ramirez seem to be the other starter candidates for the Halos. \nRamirez has recorded a 4.86 ERA in five Cactus League appearances, but he delivered his strongest start of the spring on Tuesday. His lone mistake was surrendering a solo home run to Ryan Raburn in the fourth. \n\"I thought it was very impressive,\" Scioscia said. \"What was impressive was not only the stuff -- the explosive fastball, the breaking ball and slider -- but what we saw up to a higher pitch count. He's getting to 70 pitches and maintaining his stuff.\" \nWorth noting \n• Third baseman Yunel Escobar was slated to return to the Angels' lineup on Tuesday, but he was scratched with a lingering abdominal issue. \n\"We just took him out as a precaution because he was a little tight in his workout,\" Scioscia said. \"He got treatment, felt much better. We'll evaluate him in the morning.\" \n• Richards allowed two runs (one earned) on four hits and struck out one over five innings in his Minor League start against the Triple-A Brewers on Tuesday. He threw 71 pitches. \n• Shortstop Andrelton Simmons is expected to return to Angels camp on Wednesday after representing the Netherlands in the World Baseball Classic . The Netherlands was eliminated on Monday after falling to Puerto Rico, 4-3, in a semifinal game at Dodger Stadium. \n• Jahmai Jones, ranked the Angels' No. 1 prospect by MLBPipeline.com, made his Cactus League debut on Tuesday, striking out once and playing three innings in center field. The 19-year-old outfielder batted .302 over 64 games between Rookie-level Orem and Class A Burlington in 2016. \n\"He's a talented kid,\" Scioscia said, \"He's just starting to get on that Minor League grind to get to the big leagues.\" covers the Angels for MLB.com.
