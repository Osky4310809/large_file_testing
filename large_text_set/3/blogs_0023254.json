Perhaps not coincidentally, the country’s 10 “fattest cities” are also all located in South.\nThat’s according to a study conducted by analysts at WalletHub , who “compared 100 of the most populated U.S. metro areas across 17 key indicators of weight-related problems,” including Share of Overweight Adults, Share of Adults with High Cholesterol, and Access to Parks & Recreational Facilities (we need Leslie Knope, and not Sweetums, now more than ever).\nJackson, Missouri, topped the “fattest cities” ranking with a total score of 84.93 (the lower, the better), or over two points higher than runner-up Memphis, Tennessee (82.78). Filling out — in every sense of the term — the rest of the top-10 is Little Rock, Arkansas (82.12), McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas (82.10), Shreveport, Louisiana (81.82), Chattanooga, Tennessee (79.23), Mobile, Alabama (78.86), Lafayette, Louisiana (77.03), Winston-Salem, North Carolina (76.74), and Knoxville, Tennessee (76.73). The only non-Southern city in the top-25 is Indianapolis, Indiana, at #21 (74.14). Congratulations? \nWalletHub\n\nAmong the 100 most populated metro areas in the country, Seattle, Washington, was deemed the healthiest, narrowly beating out — you guessed it — Portland, Oregon. It requires a lot of self-restraint to not eat those damn fine donuts , but as has been proven time and time again, if you want to lose weight, cut out sugar . Maybe only go to Chick-fil-A once a week, too.\nTo check out the rest of the study, head to WalletHub .\n(Via WalletHub )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T20:54:16.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
