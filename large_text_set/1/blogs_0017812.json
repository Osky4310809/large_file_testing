Schaefer works for the Inquirer. More by Mari A. Schaefer Arrow icon \nBird watchers in New Jersey have something to crow about. \nThe bald eagle population has rebounded from one nesting pair reported in 1973 to 172 nests last year, 11 more than in 2015, NJ.com reported. \nOf the nests that were monitored, 150 had eggs. A total of 216 new birds were born to 132 of those nests, the site reported. \nThe 2016 Bald Eagle Project report, released last week by the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey and the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife's Endangered and Nongame Species Program, said the number of birds born was more than enough to sustain the state's population. \nHabitat loss, human activity that can change eagles' behavior, and contaminants in the birds' food web are the biggest threats to the birds' population. \nDuring the 1980s, biologists would remove eggs from the state's single nest, in Cumberland County's Bear Swamp, and incubate them. They would then foster the chicks until they were old enough to be returned to the nest. Contamination from the insecticide DDT made the eggs too thin for a normal incubation, according to the report. \nSince 2011, wildlife experts have attached GPS transmitters to young eagles to learn more about their activities and how they interact with a \"human-dominated landscape.\" \nA look back at 2016 for New Jersey's Bald Eagles! https://t.co/VBedXEnJoL \n— Conserve Wildlife NJ (@wildlifenj) January 13, 2017 Published: January 18, 2017 — 3:16 PM EST | Updated: January 18, 2017 — 4:27 PM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
