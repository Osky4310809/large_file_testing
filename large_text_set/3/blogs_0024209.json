Plus More Schools Adding DI Programs Jordie | Email \nCornell finally got their 1st win of the season yesterday against Colgate but not before they got sniped from 60 by Colgate goalie Brandon Burke. Talk about a kick in the dick. All day at practice on Monday and Tuesday you’re working on your 10-man ride. You think that’s going to be your bread and butter. Your key to success. Then just over 2 minutes into the game, you get caught with your pants around your ankles and the goalie gets the scoring started with a bomb from Steph Curry range. Takes a solid set of cajones on that goalie to even go for that shot so early in the game. I can’t imagine many refs would keep possession with Colgate if he missed there. One of those situations where the coach is already getting ready to ream the shit out of the kid while the ball is in the air but then it ends up in the back of the net and the kid’s a hero. Unfortunately he wasn’t able to do it 15 more times because Colgate ended up losing 15-6. But that’s still a nice little highlight to have in the career package. \nSome more decently large news to come out of the college lacrosse community this week is that St. Bonaventure will be adding a DI Men’s team starting in the 2018-19 season. Not entirely sure what conference they’ll be playing in but I’m assuming they’ll either end up in the CAA or the NEC where other A10 schools play. But with that being said, maybe an A10 men’s lacrosse conference is on the way at some point. You’ve got Richmond, St. Joe’s, UMass and now St. Bonnies all with DI programs. I’m sure there are others that are coming soon as well. \nNow here’s the thing. I can guarantee you that St. Bonaventure will never become a lacrosse powerhouse. I can almost 100% completely assure you that this is a team who will be scrapping to get to .500 for a while and probably won’t be able to ask for much more than that. So is St. Bonnies getting a varsity team necessarily a huge deal as far as actual lacrosse goes? No. Not at all. It does, however, add more opportunity out there for young players looking to go to school for lacrosse. The game is growing and it’s growing fast. You don’t need me to tell you that, you already have Hank reminding you of how quickly the game is growing on Pardon My Take. But more teams at the DI level mean that there are more scholarships to hand out which means that more kids will be playing the sport because they see the opportunity which is there. Which ultimately gets the most athletic and talented kids to play the sport which helps continue to boost the overall quality of the game over time. \nI’d love to see a school like Pittsburgh get a varsity program but now that they’re an ACC school that might be a bit problematic unless they find a new conference to start. Maybe also start to focus out west with some Pac-12 schools. Utah has built a nice little team over the past few years. I’m sure Oregon could do well. Lax is already huge in Colorado so why is Denver the only team in the state with a team? You’re telling me you can’t recruit a bunch of lax rats to go out to spend 4 years at UCLA or USC? Forget about it. They’ve already signed. I know that big football schools have a ton of hoops to jump through due to Title IX and everything but there has to be a way to make it happen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:51:05.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
