(Peter Rodis/Netflix) \nThe words are powerful in their simplicity, filled with the ache of a bitter history: \nI wish I knew how it would feel to be free. \nI wish I could break all the chains holding me. \nI wish I could say all the things that I should say. \nSay ’em loud, say ’em clear, for the whole wide world to hear. \nThese are the lyrics to “ I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free ,” written in 1954 by jazz pianist and composer Billy Taylor, made famous in the 1960s by legendary soul singer and Civil Rights icon Nina Simone, who added it to her regular repertoire. At the height of the Civil Rights movement, the song became a powerful anthem — a favorite of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. It was played in nightclubs, at festivals, before audiences packed with passionate activists. \nAnd on Sunday, it was played as part of a Ford commercial that aired during the Super Bowl. \nFor those who know the song’s storied history, it was a rather jarring juxtaposition: “I wish I knew how it would feel to be free,” Simone sang in her rich alto, over images depicting familiar inconveniences — the sort that might afflict those of a certain privilege. There was a skier dangling on a stalled lift. A man stranded on his roof after his ladder tipped over. A dismayed woman sitting in a traffic jam, her frown bathed in the reddish glow of taillights. \n“No one likes being stuck,” the commercial’s narrator intoned. “That’s why Ford is developing new ways to help you move through life — faster, easier, better.” [ The five worst Super Bowl commercials ] \nOn Twitter, where the masses rushed to share instant reactions to all things Super Bowl-related, some people applauded the commercial. A few said they were happy to hear Simone’s song played before such a massive audience. But others swiftly objected the use of the song — about the long and painful struggle for racial justice — to sell cars. HOLD ON. this Ford commercial using Nina Simone's I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free to sell cars IS NOT CUTE. irresponsible. ugh. \n— Kevin Allred (@KevinAllred) February 6, 2017 If you were wondering about the worst way to use a Nina Simone song, the answer is in a Ford super bowl commercial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:22:27.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
