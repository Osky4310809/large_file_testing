It wasn’t an overly surprising move, considering Smith had just 20 receptions in 2016, but he was just two years into his five-year deal. \nAfter the news broke, Torrey Smith shared a message with 49ers fans and took some time to thank a bunch of people within the organization. He also told owner Jed York to “keep up the great work,” and said the 49ers franchise is “first class and is heading in the right direction.” A post shared by Torrey Smith (@torreysmithwr) on Mar 6, 2017 at 3:21pm PST \nSmith signed a big five-year deal two offseasons ago, but his time in San Francisco was disappointing. He caught just 53 passes for 930 yards and seven touchdowns – numbers that barely matched his production in 2014 alone. \nThe 49ers will save $4.8 million in cap space by releasing Smith just two years into his $40 million deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:26:15.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
