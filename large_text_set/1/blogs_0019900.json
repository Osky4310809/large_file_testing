Obama State Department Spox Marie Harf as Contributor by Josh Feldman | 5:31   \nFox News announced today that they are hiring former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf as a contributor. \nThe network said in a press release Harf would “offer national security and political analysis” and she would be making her debut tonight on Martha MacCallum ‘s 7 pm program The First 100 Days . \nIf Harf’s name sounds familiar to you, it might be because of a brief controversy from two years ago. In an MSNBC interview where she discussed the fight against ISIS, Harf said, “We cannot win this war by killing them. We cannot kill our way out of this war. We need in the medium to longer term to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups, whether it’s a lack of opportunity for jobs.” \nShe received criticism and mockery for that statement, but one of the people most vocal in defending her was none other than Fox News’ own James Rosen . At the time Rosen said Harf’s comments were “widely misunderstood” and he expressed serious concern about the level of sexist online vitriol she had received . \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:18:19.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
