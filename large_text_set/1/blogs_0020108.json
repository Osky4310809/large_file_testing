He is a player of the future who is going to grow a lot.\" Guedes has been on the rise at Benfica (Photo: AFP) \nGuedes, who is represented by Jorge Mendes, is seen as one of the most highly-rated prospects in Portuguese football right now. \nAnd after committing his future to Benfica during the summer for this season, Guedes has been thrust front and centre in a new-look side. \nRather than playing out wide, Guedes has been lining up in a central role for much of the season, under coach Rui Vitoria, responding with seven goals and seven assists in 28 games. \nHowever, speculation surrounding a move this month has ramped up in recent days, with Record stating that he was left out of the squad for the 4-0 win over Tondela at the weekend, due to negotiations over a potential exit from the Stadium of Light. poll loading Who will win Ligue 1? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T20:38:36.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
