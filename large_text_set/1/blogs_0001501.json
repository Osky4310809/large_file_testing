REUTERS/Lucas Jackson 5401503 \nPresident-elect Donald Trump told incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that he liked him much better than Republican leadership in Congress, according to a Sunday report from the New York Post. \nThe exchange occurred during a private phone call between the two leaders, but staffers with Schumer’s office failed to confirm the content of the exchange, according to the report. Trump’s lack of affection for Republican leadership stems from the fact that “establishment” Republicans didn’t support Trump during his bid for the White House, according to an unnamed staffer with the Trump transition. \nTrump “said to Schumer he likes Schumer more than Ryan and McConnell because they both wanted him to lose,” the source told the New York Post. “They are Republicans and Trump knows they didn’t support him.” \nTrump describes his relationship with Schumer as “very good,” and the two men reportedly shared several phone conversations in the weeks following Trump’s election to the White House in November. \nThat affection could change now that Schumer doubled down on his move to slow every appointee Trump made to his cabinet. \n“President-elect Trump is attempting to fill his rigged cabinet with nominees that would break key campaign promises and have made billions off the industries they’d be tasked with regulating,” Schumer announced in an official statement Sunday. \n“Any attempt by Republicans to have a series of rushed, truncated hearings before Inauguration Day and before the Congress and public have adequate information on all of them is something Democrats will vehemently resist. If Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they’re sorely mistaken.” \nSenate Democrats could force as much as 30 hours of debate on the floor of the Senate for each appointee, a process that would take much needed deliberation time away from issues the Trump administration plans to change in the first days of the new administration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T04:37:16.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
