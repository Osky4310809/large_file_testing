Please send us a direct message and we’d be happy to assist you.” For the majority of brands, this is what customer service on social media looks like. Polite, respectful, and helpful. \nBut not for every brand. \nBusinesses now use their social handles to deliver sharp wit, make clever jokes, and throw shade. \nWhile having a sense of humor is important, there is a line. And crossing it can have consequences. Just ask the folks at Hawke and Co . \nStill, several brands have been unable to pass up on opportunities for a good burn. In the following 10 situations, it paid off. \nBe safe out there. 1. Tesco Mobile tells a hard truth \nTesco Mobile, a UK-based mobile network, is probably one of the sassiest brands on Twitter. They’ve earned a reputation for handing out some vicious burns, to the delight of their nearly 80,000 followers. \nIt was hard to choose the best Tesco Mobile burn. There are a lot of them . But this one stands out due to its reach. @LiyahSummers When you realise your mates are ignoring you L L #nojoke \n— Tesco Mobile (@tescomobile) June 30, 2013 \nOver 11,000 retweets and over 7,000 favorites should be enough to convince you that Tesco has the Twitter burn down to a science. They didn’t pick someone complaining about their product or customer service. They sought out someone trying to make a joke at their expense, and decided to defend their brand in an extremely relatable way: with a third degree burn right out of the school yard. \nPeople have started following Tesco specifically because of the guile they show in conversations with their “haters.” \nHow many phone companies do you follow? Probably only the one you use. Tesco’s approach has allowed them to connect with a wider audience, including many non-clients. I couldn’t resist, here’s another one. \n@JayFeliipe Are you really in a position to be turning girls away? — Tesco Mobile (@tescomobile) October 16, 2013 \nCall the fire department! 2. Wendy’s roasts a customer \nThe fast food chain made headlines when it delivered an epic comeback to a customer who accused them of lying about their “never frozen beef.” if you're having a bad day today, just remember that you didn't get dragged by a fast food company on twitter pic.twitter.com/gUSuHwZLQR \nSince then, Wendy has continued to provide giggles on an ongoing basis. The burger joint has earned a reputation for handing out vicious burns—much to the delight of their 1.51 million strong—and growing—Twitter fanbase. @ceophono No, your opinion is though. \nWith some tweets getting upwards of 10,000 retweets and 30,000 likes, Wendy’s is definitely getting noticed for their risky comebacks. 3. Discovery Channel teaches the Penguins a lesson \nHow did a simple tweet from the Discovery Channel turn into an awesome burn lauded by hockey fans? It all comes down to the innocent penguin. \nIn 2015 Discovery sent out a tweet on the average height of the emperor penguin. On average, emperor penguins grow to be 3.8 feet tall >> http://t.co/HpD6bwgzhQ pic.twitter.com/PgLuwLYuBB \n— Discovery (@Discovery) May 13, 2015 \nThe Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team saw it as an opportunity to maybe spark some interesting social media conversations. They responded with a tweet of their own, on the average height of a Pittsburgh Penguin. Clever… except in retrospect, since it lead to this amazing comeback. \n@penguins Strange. Our latest observations show no Penguin activity currently on ice in Pittsburgh. Where did they go? — Discovery (@Discovery) May 14, 2015 \nA little context: the Penguins had, only a few weeks earlier, been eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs. Maybe Discovery’s social media manager is a hockey fan of a different breed? Either way, a network that is known for providing educational programming definitely taught the Penguins a lesson. \nAnd it paid off to the tune of 31,000 retweets and 34,000 favorites. 4. #DearEverlane hashtag sheds light on the consumer experience \nEverlane’s hashtag #DearEverlane encourages customers to share questions, concerns, and brand experiences online. Everlane then takes to social media to showcase some of their best interactions: A post shared by Everlane (@everlane) on Mar 30, 2016 at 10:41am PDT \nIn a specific #DearEverlane post, “Rupert” decided to call the clothing company out on the value of its products: A post shared by Everlane (@everlane) on Aug 27, 2016 at 9:00am PDT \nInstead of burying the negative feedback, the clothing brand presented Rupert’s commentary on their Instagram account. \nThe retailer fired back with a smart explanation as to why their sweaters cost as much as they do—as well as referencing Rupert’s snarky suggestion to “get a brain scan performed.” \n#DearEverlane opens dialogue on social media and gives the brand an opportunity to address topics off all kinds—the good, the bad, and the ugly. It’s also another great example of using hashtags to drive engagement . 5. Smart Car proves how smart it really is \nSmart cars don’t appeal to folks who prefer driving something a little bigger. The small size of these cars has made them the butt of jokes ever since they were first introduced. Rather than take offense, the company is pretty good at letting things slide. \nBut, just this once, they decided to take on a stupid joke about their product. \n‘Oh our cars can be destroyed by bird poop can they? Maybe they can, but it would take 45,000 emus to make it happen. You and your joke have just been scienced. Good day.’ \nThis isn’t so much a traditional burn as it is a mic drop moment. They took a joke made at their expense, proved they were paying attention, and actually transformed it into a brand win. If there was a tweet in this list that you might actually want to mimic, this would be the one. 6. Totino’s responds to S.N.L.’s Super Bowl skit \nIf there’s one Super Bowl commercial that is sure to delight every year, it’s Saturday Night Live’s Totino’s pizza roll skit. \nThe parody Totino’s Super Bowl ad sheds light on gender stereotypes when it comes to football. The main character is a Stepford Wives-inspired housewife who plays clueless about the game and gets ordered around at her husband’s Super Bowl viewing party. \nEvery year has been pretty spectacular, but 2017’s skit received significant amounts of buzz when Kristen Stewart and Vanessa Bayer fell in love on-screen . \nWhen it came time for Totino’s to respond, they came back with a couple of cheeky but perfect retorts. *sees another Totino’s parody ad**sighs, logs in to work email for the next 12 hours* \n— Pete Zaroll (@totinos) February 5, 2017 Hey, it's like we always say: pizza rolls, not gender roles. #SNL @nbcsnl \n— Pete Zaroll (@totinos) February 5, 2017 7. DiGiorno Pizza with the smooth delivery \nRapper Iggy Azalea made headlines on Grammy night in 2015, not for her award nominations, but for a Twitter battle with Papa John’s restaurant. \nIggy ordered a pizza and the restaurant employee who delivered it distributed her information to their family member, who proceeded to send Iggy unwanted texts. Iggy was less than pleased, with both the texts and the response of a Papa John’s manager, and she spread that displeasure on Twitter . \nThis was a potential PR nightmare for Papa John’s, which apologized and did their best to address the situation on Twitter. Another brand saw the situation in a different light, however, and rushed in to take advantage. @DiGiornoPizza I know right! \n— IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) February 9, 2015 \nDiGiorno Pizza is a maker of frozen pizzas that uses the tagline “It’s not delivery, it’s DiGiorno.” The entire situation was a perfect match for their value proposition, and their generally casual and humorous approach to Twitter. Their tweet was simple but effective, and took advantage of a competitor’s screw-up (smh means “shake my head,” for the record). By entering the conversation, DiGiorno ended up with a quasi-endorsement from a famous rapper. One brand’s nightmare is another’s dream. 8. Arby’s embraces their enemies \nIn the midst of a rebrand, Arby’s decided to come back with a little more bite. \nThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart had been making fun of the fast food chain for years , with jokes questioning their food’s edibility. “It’s like a shock and awe for your bowels,” the comedian once said. Sometimes Jon's jokes about us were hard to digest, but we kept watching #TheDailyShow anyway. #JonVoyage pic.twitter.com/FGoLhf6QyX \n— Arby's (@Arbys) August 6, 2015 \nWhen Stewart was about to end his hosting career, Arby’s took the opportunity to respond after years of being mocked. The fast food chain produced a farewell commercial called “Jon Voyage,” featuring a montage of Stewart’s harshest slights combined with the Golden Girls’ theme song “Thank You For Being A Friend.” \nThis was followed by a few clever quips to Stewart on the Arby’s Twitter handle. Jon, feel free to reach out to us at careers@arbys.com. \nWell said, Arby’s. 9. Taco Bell adds a little spice \nTaco Bell is known to be one of the most entertaining and humorous brands on social media. Their target audience is fairly young, making them the perfect target for funny, risky content. When Old Spice, another brand who doesn’t shy away from humor, presented them with the following opportunity, they were sure to take it. \n@OldSpice Is your deodorant made with really old spices? — Taco Bell (@tacobell) July 9, 2012 \nOld Spice threw it up, and Taco Bell hit it out of the park. This tweet is the perfect burn. It doesn’t take down the brand, just the tweet in question. It makes you smile without ever feeling at all malicious. \nBrand on brand burns are far less risky, since no clients are involved. They’re usually far more beneficial as well, since they benefit from the substantial network of both businesses. Case and point: RedBull tried to join in on this duel after the fact (though, in this case, it was uninspired). @TacoBell @OldSpice No bull: the original Energy Drink is not made of wiiings. \n— Red Bull (@redbull) July 12, 2012 10. Old Spice with the tough love \nSince, as mentioned, Old Spice is another brand that embraces humor and risky tweets, they’ve also earned their spot on this list. Old Spice does a great job of throwing not-so-subtle jabs at followers and fans, especially those who send them weird tweets. Like poor old Sunil here. \n@Sunillin try Tinder. — Old Spice (@OldSpice) October 31, 2013 \nIn this case, the Twitter user sent something weird and off-beat, so Old Spice felt comfortable responding in a similar way. The burn is playful, not insulting, that’s a pretty good description of their Twitter presence in general. If you’re going to burn someone, burn someone who is asking for the burn… maybe even hoping for it. \nInspired by these comebacks?
