Michelle Obama played Catchphrase with Jimmy Fallon and two of his other guests — comedians Dave Chapelle and Jerry Seinfeld . Needless to say, it was quite the lineup.\nMichelle Obama, of course, looked absolutely stunning during her visit — even when she did a version of “the robot” for one of her turns. Under such immense pressure, she also managed to remember her husband’s fondness of “dad jeans.” If that’s not true love, we simply don’t know what is.\nWatch as she totally dominates the game. (Of course, Seinfeld, Fallon, and Chapelle also do an incredible job.) She said exactly what we were thinking, when Fallon stumbled on that Beyoncé reference . Really, Jimmy?\nShe also made us laugh a few times. “This game has gone off the rails,” Obama stated after Chapelle accidentally said one of the secret words. Indeed, it did. There were a few fumbles during gameplay, but that just made the game even more exciting. Plus, seeing Michelle Obama hold it all together was pretty thrilling as well.\nWe’re going to miss her so much. Hopefully she continues to make public appearances after leaving the White House, because seeing her on television is always beneficial.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T16:54:07.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
