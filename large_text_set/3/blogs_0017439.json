TechCrunch Sessions: Justice will bring together tech leaders, engineers, investors, educators, and activists engaged in a conversation with the startup community around the responsibilities to promote justice and equality in today’s business world and society at large. \nThis is the first event in our new series called Sessions where single topics are explored at length. We designed Sessions to be more intimate than Disrupt. Seating is very limited and the events will not be livestreamed. \nThe event, which goes down June 6 at the Alamo Drafthouse in San Francisco, will offer speakers and attendees alike the opportunity to explore tech’s role in civic and social activism, politics, the criminal justice system, STEM education, inclusion and more. \nThroughout the day, attendees will hear from tech leaders, activists, educators and heads of diversity and inclusion. There will be plenty of opportunities to chat with the speakers after their sessions and learn about their processes. \nIf you’re interested in attending, be sure to give us your information here and you’ll be the first to know when tickets become available. This event is open to anyone and everyone who is passionate about these issues or eager to learn more. \nTo give you an idea of what’s to come, here’s a preview of who you can expect at TC Sessions: Justice.

She believes CODE2040 sits in the perfect intersection of a skills- and network-building opportunity for Black and Latino talent and a systems change opportunity for a critical segment of the country’s economy. \nJustin Steele, Principal at Google.org \nAs principal of Google.org, Justin Steele is tasked with leading the organization’s grant portfolios. He has also spearheaded the organization’s efforts to tackle racial justice through its financial support of organizations like the Center for Policing Equity and Measures for Justice.
