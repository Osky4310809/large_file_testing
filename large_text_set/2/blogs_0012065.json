Shares \nFebruary 14: Valentine's Day! A day for sharing your deepest feelings of affection with the ones you love, with roses, poetry, sweet candy, and fine dinner by candlelight. Also, perhaps coincidentally (although I suspect not), a good time for massive, heavily-muscled men to bludgeon each other to death with primitive weaponry for our amusement. \nWe have a pretty good idea of what's in store in For Honor , Ubisoft's Vikings-vs-Samurai-vs-Knight melee brawler, thanks to the recently-concluded closed and open betas . So this video is mainly for fun, and it hits all the appropriate notes: Catchy tune set to a martial beat, slow-motion carnage, machismo posing, and even the ultimate classic—walking away from an explosion without looking back. Boom! \nI spent a few hours in the For Honor closed beta and even though PvP isn't really my bag, I was impressed by how well the combat system worked. The controls took me awhile to get comfortable with—they're more complex than the frantic hack-and-slash of most FPS melee modes—but they enable a good degree of precision and flexibility in combat, and the available classes seemed well balanced too (by which I mean, they all kicked my ass with equal ease). \nWe'll have our full review of For Honor up soon; in the meantime, you can follow along with Andy K's adventures in a \"preposterously burly\" medieval world in our review-in-progress . ABOUT THE AUTHOR Andy Chalk As lead news writer during ‘merican hours, Andy covers the day-to-day events that keep PC gaming so interesting, exciting, and occasionally maddening. He’s fond of RPGs, FPSs, dungeons, Myst, and the glorious irony of his parents buying him a TRS-80 instead of an Atari so he wouldn't end up wasting his life on videogames.
