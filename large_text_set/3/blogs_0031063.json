Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr. leads ship captain Aurelio Agac-ac inside the military camp in Zamboanga City after he was rescued Saturday dawn in Basilan. Philstar.com/ Roel Pareño \nBASILAN, Philippines - Government troops rescued a tugboat chief engineer Monday night from the captivity of the Abu Sayyaf group in the coastal town of Basilan, according to security officials. \nCol. Juvymax Uy, chief of the Joint Task Force Basilan (JTFB), said Laurencio Tiro, chief engineer of Super Shuttle T/B 1, was rescued about 10:30 p.m. Monday at Sitio Sasa, Barangay Basakan, Hadji Mohammad Ajul town. \nTiro was rescued barely three days when his tugboat captain, Aurelio Agac-ac, was rescued last Saturday dawn also near the area. \nUy said the troops of the 4th Special Forces Battalion (SFB) under Lt. Col. Andrew Bacalla and members of the Barangay Police Action Team of Mayor Taib Pawaki rescued Tiro, who was hastily abandoned on the shoreline at Sitio Sasa by his captors to delay the military pursuit. \nThe rescued victim was brought to Camp Navarro General Hospital (CNGH) in Zamboanga City for medical check-up and subsequently presented to Maj. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., chief of the Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom). \nAgac-ac and Tiro were seized aboard their tugboat steaming alongside Super Shuttle 9 last Thursday at the seawaters off Sibago Island, Basilan by a group of armed men suspected to be members of the Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom group.
