We’ve seen teaser pics before, but now, one day early, we get to see the whole thing, thanks to this Spanish website. It’s sleek! \nThe Velar’s design aesthetic is clearly derived from the Evoque’s low-greenhouse, sleek lines, and the general idea of a stretched Evoque seems to work fairly well.

Plus, what is this, bronze in there? \nWe’ve known the Velar will have a nice, huge, full-glass roof for some time, but this is the first time we’ve seen through that roof to the full interior, which is pleasingly two-toned (at least in this particular trim) and looks, like the rest of the car, clean and modern. \nThe fabric textures look interesting as well, though it’s hard to tell just what it is from these pictures. Oh, and it looks like it uses a rotary knob for the transmission, so if you hate those, you have a new car to rant about.
