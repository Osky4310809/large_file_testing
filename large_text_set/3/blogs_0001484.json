( UPDATE : Later Sunday evening, a Google spokesperson told us the Google Home was no longer giving the answer heard below.) \nIt’s not the first glitch for Google Home that’s gone viral. Multiple users reported their units were activated by Google’s Super Bowl commercial. And we learned that it’s not hard to prank Google Home and Amazon Echo into a cycle of never-ending chicanery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:54:35.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
