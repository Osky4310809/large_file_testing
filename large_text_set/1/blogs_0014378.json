Those with MyRapid cards will only be able to use them when Phase 2 of the MRT (between Semantan and Kajang) opens in July later this year. \nMRT fares for the Phase 1 operations are priced between RM1.20 and RM3.90 for cash payments, while cashless fares are between RM1.20 and RM3.40. On a related matter, MRT feeder bus services will cost RM1 per trip and payments are via Touch ‘n Go cards. \nStudents, senior citizens and those with disabilities will be given a 50% discount for both the MRT and feeder bus fares, and they can purchase the concession tokens from the customer services offices at any MRT station.
