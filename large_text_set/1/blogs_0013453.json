Around £700,000 was raised to fund treatment in the USA. \nEverton pledged £200,000 to the cause in September, when Bradley was mascot for Sunderland's home fixture with the Toffees at the Stadium of Light. Bradley was all smiles as he posed for the pre-match photo alongside officials, Everton captain Gareth Barry and Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta \nFans up and down the country took Bradley to their hearts, resulting in him receiving thousands of Christmas cards. \nHis appearance at Goodison Park was much anticipated, with travelling City fans holding aloft a banner stating: \"Cancer has no colours, one Bradley Lowery\". \nFormer Everton midfielder Peter Reid said the youngster would \"love\" the experience in a tweet which also featured a banner inscribed with 'there's only one Bradley Lowery'. Manchester City fans took a banner with their own message of support to Goodison Park \nPrior to kick-off, Bradley jogged around on the pitch and after arriving with the teams from the tunnel, he engaged in some shouting with referee Mark Clattenburg, who seemed to enjoy the interaction. \nAfter the fixture, Everton will present Bradley's family with the funds raised from an auction of match-worn and signed shirts from the match at the Stadium of Light earlier this season. \nUpon announcing that Bradley's cancer had grown, Mrs Lowery said she was unsure whether to \"take my baby home\" or \"put him through more gruelling treatment that could leave him fighting for his life\". Everton were quick to respond to Bradley's message on the back of his shirt Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T19:12:38.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
