March is Women’s History Month, so what better to kick that off than a viewing of 1996’s The Craft ?\nFebruary is ending, but black history deserves more than 28 days. I’m struck by how many old political films Netflix making available next month, including the 1944 propaganda film The Negro Solider, which was made to convince African Americans to fight in WWII. Other interesting watches might be the propaganda films Know Your Enemy: Japan and Tunisian Victory— maybe you’ll find some interesting parallels with our current moment. And by maybe I mean definitely.\nOriginals arriving include Burning Sands, Julie’s Greenroom , Iron Fist (sigh), Deidra & Laney Rob a Train, the Japanese series Samurai Gourmet, 13 Reasons Why, and The Discovery. Disney’s newer movies Pete’s Dragon and The BFG are coming as well, but you can revisit Coraline or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? if you’d prefer something more uncanny.\nWe’re definitely gaining a lot more than we’re losing. Shark fans might want to give all the Jaws a re-watch, but if there’s something in there we should definitely see let us know in the comments below!\nAvailable 3/1/17 \nAngry Birds: Season 2 (2013)\nBlazing Saddles (1974)\nChicago (2002)\nDeep Run (2015)\nDirt Every Day: Season 1 (2013)\nEpic Drives: Season 2 (2015\nFriday After Next (2002)\nHead 2 Head: Season 2 (2013)\nHot Rod Unlimited: Season 1 (2013)\nIgnition: Season 1 (2013)\nImpossible Dreamers (2017)\nJurassic Park (1993)\nJurassic Park III (2001)\nKate and Mim-Mim: Season 2 (2015)\nKnow Your Enemy – Japan (1945)\nKung Fu Panda (2008)\nLet There Be Light (1946)\nMemento (2000)\nMidnight in Paris (2011)\nNacho Libre (2006)\nNazi Concentration Camps (1945)\nRoadkill: Season 2 (2013)\nRolling Stones: Crossfire Hurricane (2012)\nSan Pietro (1945)\nSinging with Angels (2016)\nSustainable (2016)\nSlums of Beverly Hills (1998)\nThe Craft (1996)\nThis Is Spinal Tap (1984)\nTenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny (2006)\nThe Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)\nThe Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (1944)\nThe Negro Soldier (1944)\nThunderbolt (1947)\nTunisian Victory (1944)\nAvailable 3/3/17 \nGreenleaf: Season 1 (2016)\nAvailable 3/4/17 \nSafe Haven (2013)\nAvailable 3/5/17 \nSeñora Acero: Season 3 (2016)\nAmy Schumer: The Leather Special—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nAvailable 3/8/17 \nHands of Stone (2016)\nThe Waterboy (1998)\nAvailable 3/9/17 \nThithi (2015)\nAvailable 3/10/17 \nBuddy Thunderstruck: Season 1—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nBurning Sands—NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\nLove: Season 2—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nOne More Time: Season 1—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nThe Boss’ Daughter (2016)\nAvailable 3/13/17 \nMust Love Dogs (2005)\nMillion Dollar Baby (2004)\nAvailable 3/14/17 \nDisney’s Pete’s Dragon (2016)\nJim Norton: Mouthful of Shame—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nAvailable 3/15/17 \nDisney’s The BFG (2016)\nNotes on Blindness (2016)\nAvailable 3/16/17 \nBeau Sejour: Season 1 –NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nCoraline (2009)\nAvailable 3/17/17 \nDeidra & Laney Rob a Train—NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\nJulie’s Greenroom: Season 1—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nMarvel’s Iron Fist: Season 1—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nNaledi: A Baby Elephant’s Tale (2016)\nPandora—NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\nSamurai Gourmet: Season 1—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nAvailable 3/18/17 \nCome and Find Me (2016)\nThe Vampire Diaries: Season 8 (2016)\nAvailable 3/20/17 \nEl Reemplazante: Season 1-2 (2012)\nAvailable 3/21/17 \nAli & Nino (2016)\nAnother Forever (2016)\nEvolution (2015)\nFire at the Sea (Fuocoammare) (2016)\nAvailable 3/23/17 \nHow to Get Away with Murder: Season 3 (2016)\nWelcome to New York (2015)\nAvailable 3/24/17 \nBottersnikes & Gumbles: Season 2—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nDéjà Vu (2006)\nFelipe Neto: My Life Makes No Sense—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nGrace and Frankie: Season 3—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nIngobernable: Season 1—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nSpider (2007)\nThe Square (2008)\nThe Most Hated Woman in America—NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\nAvailable 3/25/17 \nThe Student Body (2017)\nUSS Indianapolis: Men of Courage (2016)\nAvailable 3/26/17 \nThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)\nAvailable 3/27/17 \nBetter Call Saul: Season 2\nAvailable 3/28/17 \nArcher: Season 7 (2016)\nJo Koy: Live from Seattle—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nAvailable 3/30/17 \nLife in Pieces: Season 1 (2015)\nAvailable 3/31/17 \n13 Reasons Why: Season 1—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nBordertown: Season 1—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nCooper Barrett’s Guide to Surviving Life: Season 1 (2016\nDinotrux: Season 4—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nFirstBorn (2016)\nFive Came Back—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nGLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (2012)\nRosewood: Season 1\nThe Carmichael Show: Season 1-2\nThe Discovery—NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\nTrailer Park Boys: Season 11—NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nLeaving 3/1/17 \nJaws\nJaws 2\nJaws 3\nJaws: The Revenge\nJustice League: War\nJustice League: The Flashpoint Paradox\nKeeping Up Appearances\nMonarch of the Glen: Seasons 1 – 7\nNational Lampoon’s Animal House\nRobin Hood: Seasons 1 – 3\nSurvivors: Series 1 – 2\nLeaving 3/2/17 \nBlack or White\nSweetwater\nLeaving 3/3/17 \nBill & Ted’s Bogus Journey\nMisfire\nWeb Junkie\nLeaving 3/4/17 \nEntertainment\nI Dream of Wires\nOtto the Rhino\nSeashore\nThe Discoverers\nThe Nanny Diaries\nLeaving 3/5/17 \nFood Chains\nJail Caesar\nThe Days to Come\nTwo Hundred Thousand Dirty\nLeaving 3/6/17 \nPit Stop\nRigor Mortis\nLeaving 3/7/17 \nHansel vs. Gretel\nLeaving 3/8/17 \nLove At First Fight\nThe Starving Games\nLeaving 3/15/17 \nBoy\nB for Boy\nMy Girlfriend’s Boyfriend\nSushi: The Global Catch\nLeaving 3/16/17 \nAmerican Dreamz\nLeaving 3/23/17 \nLove Me\nThe Invincible Iron Man\nLeaving 3/25/17 \nAll Stars\nPup\nThe Perfect Wedding\nLeaving 3/27/17 \nDragonwolf\nLeaving 3/28/17 \nErasing Hate\nThe Kingdom of Dreams and Madness\nLeaving 3/29/17 \n6 Guns\nDetropia\nI Melt With You\nMega Shark vs. Mecha Shark\nThe Life and Crimes of Doris Payne\nWhat are you excited to watch?
