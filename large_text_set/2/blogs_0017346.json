Most Popular By Jack Holmes Feb 21, 2017 It was a wild weekend for conservatism and the Family Values™ Crowd . So just in case this was lost in the outrage cacophony, the President of the United States denounced the American press as \"enemies of the American people\" Friday. This authoritarian salvo wasn't actually a Trump original—it's a remix of an old-school track out of the Soviet Union from Vladimir Lenin.

Colbert had time for that one, too last night: FAKE NEWS! Sad!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:07:24.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
