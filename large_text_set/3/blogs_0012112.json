No longer do we have to choke down the crow pies so beloved of medieval England—where the birds’ very feet may have “made useful handles in a pre–oven mitt era,” according to some histories . Nor need we suffer the saccharine, gooey, artificially colored tragedies of our grandparents’ generation.\nRelated The $.50 Trick to Perfect Pie Crust View article Still, our ancestors in the pie kitchen tossed up a few good ideas. Check out the American Pie Council website, for instance, where a breezy history notes that the very first written pie recipe “was published by the Romans and was for a rye-crusted goat cheese and honey pie.”\nI read this some years ago and it stuck with me���it sounds wonderful, doesn’t it? Every so often since then I’d recall the rye-crusted goat cheese and honey pie and dig around the internet for a recipe, either the Roman original or some twee modern-day interpretation that called for, like, goat’s-milk ricotta and orange blossom honey or something.\nBut it was for naught. The APC's mention has been cited in various fun-facts-about-pie-type roundups , but in all my searching no actual recipe presented itself—anywhere.\nI emailed the pie council’s PR rep, asking if she could point me toward a source for the information on the rye-crusted goat cheese and honey pie. Sorry, she said—no one at the council actually has any idea where that particular bit of history came from.\nSo I turned to the academics. Robert Curtis, an emeritus professor at the University of Georgia who's written articles with names like “ Umami and the Foods of Classical Antiquity ,” emailed to say that while he doesn’t know much about the history of pie, “the cheese and honey pie (actually more of a cake, I think) that you are searching for is probably the one mentioned in Cato De Agricultura 76 where it's called placenta .” (Mouthwatering, right? In Latin, “placenta” means “flat cake.” )\nHow Do I Roll Out Pie Dough Perfectly Every Single Time?\nView slideshow And Rosemary Moore, a classicist at the University of Iowa, also pointed me toward Cato the Elder (who published in 160 BC): “My first instinct is that this is a recipe with some modifications,” she wrote in an email. “Cato is unusual in providing some really specific instructions for that period, though, as I'm sure you know, ancient recipes were written with much less guidance than those today.”\nCato’s placenta recipe does indeed go into a good bit of detail, and would also appear to create a placenta the size of a coffee table. “Materials, 2 pounds of wheat flour for the crust, 4 pounds of flour and 4 pounds of prime groats for the tracta,” the recipe begins—tractum being a kind of biscuit that’s layered alternating with the cheese. The cheese, by the way? Sheep’s milk, 14 pounds of it (“sweet and quite fresh,” please), sweetened with four and a half pounds of honey.\nBut this didn't exactly solve the problem of the rye-crusted goat cheese and honey pie, which can only be the \"first published recipe\" referred to by the American Pie Council if we imagine in ingredients that aren't there: Cato makes no mention of rye, and calls for sheep's cheese. And Cato's recipe looks a little basic, to be honest. You can take your Roman placenta and bury it in the backyard—where’s the recipe I want?\nI decided that if I was going to make the rye-crusted goat cheese and honey pie of my imagination, I'd have to figure it out my own self. Following Cato, I envisioned a homey, cheesecake-like dessert, but baked into a single, rye-flour-spiked pie crust—something along the lines of a custard pie.\nRelated", "external_links": ["http://the-toast.net/2014/03/03/problem-dinner-cato-elder/", "http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2015/03/history_of_pie_how_savory_meat_pies_evolved_into_america_s_favorite_dessert.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19571231", "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/placenta", "http://ew.com/tv/2016/12/21/peak-tv/", "http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cato/de_agricultura/e*.html", "http://www.piecouncil.org/Events/NationalPieDay/HistoryOfPies", "http://vintage-ads.livejournal.com/3595223.html", "http://www.eater.com/2015/7/1/8872413/pie-crust-apple-cream-custard-chess-styles-where-to-eat"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:13:06.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
