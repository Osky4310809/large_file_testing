To me it’s the latter, so I sign up.’ \nMargaret Atwood \n‘I am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own.’ \nAudre Lorde \nAudre Lorde (Photo by Robert Alexander/Archive Photos/Getty Images) This synchronised swimming group is doing a special performance dedicated to periods ‘I am a feminist because I believe in social change, equality and making society and the world a more equal place.’ \nChantal Partamian \n‘When a man gives his opinion, he’s a man. When a woman gives her opinion, she’s a bitch.’ \nBette Davis \nKate Nash (Picture: Getty) ‘Feminism is not a dirty word. It does not mean you hate men, it does not mean you hate girls that have nice legs and a tan, and it does not mean you are a bitch or a dyke, it means that you believe in equality.’ \nKate Nash \n‘We cannot succeed when half of us are held back.’ \nMalala Yousafzai \nEmma Watson (Picture: Getty) ‘I am from Britain and think it is right that as a woman I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I think it is right that I should be able to make decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decision-making of my country. I think it is right that socially I am afforded the same respect as men.’ \nEmma Watson \n‘I want to say to you who think women cannot succeed, we have brought the government of England to this position, that it has to face this alternative: either women are to be killed or women are to have the vote.’ \nEmmeline Pankhurst \n‘I myself have never able to find out precisely what a feminist is. I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat.’ \nRebecca West \nMore Meet the female gym boss who's revolutionising the city with her boutique workouts \nMarathon training week 7: becoming a commuter-runner \nFirst look at Victoria Beckham's debut high-street collaboration with Target \n‘A good part – and definitely the most fun part – of being a feminist is about frightening men.’ \nJulie Burchill \n‘No woman can call herself free who does not own and control her body. No woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother’ \nMargaret Sanger \nHillary Clinton (Picture: Getty) ‘I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfil my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.’ \nHillary Clinton \n‘All men should be feminists. If men cared about women’s rights, the world would be a better place.’ \nJohn Legend \nMORE: International Women’s Day 2017: What is it, when is it and how can you get involved? \nMORE: International Women’s Strike planned and here’s how you can get involved ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T19:35:09.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
