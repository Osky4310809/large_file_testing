Jim and Lee have been not just on the ropes, but now border on hatred as Jim, you know, killed her husband on their wedding night (he was about to murder her, but she doesn't necessarily know or believe that). The budding relationship between Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne was a light in the dark, though, and they even managed to have some real fun last week. \nCamren Bicondova told Comicbook.com that Selina's rare moment of true happiness won't last, and indeed we saw on tonight's episode what she means - her mother was revealed as a con artist, and Bruce knew (or at least had a very strong feeling) that was the case. How will she respond? It looks like she's going back to being a solo act. \n\"I'm definitely excited for her to go through a dark phase and be on her own, those are my two main things,\" Bicondova teased. \"I think it’s very liberating for a young lady to go through a very big change. I’m excited to see, whatever change happens, I’m excited to see how she deals with it, and I’m excited to be able to play that. So that’s what I’m excited for right now, a big change and how she deals with it after the change!” \nNow, #BatCat as they're known amongst the Gotham fandom was never meant to be a lasting thing - in the comics they've been on and off so often you can set your watch to it. But while it's the end here for now, it seems, at least we'll get to explore a little more of what makes Selina tick, and how she gets back to her main mission of surviving. \n\"Survival will always be her main goal,\" she said. And now she'll be doing it without Bruce once more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:30:36.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
