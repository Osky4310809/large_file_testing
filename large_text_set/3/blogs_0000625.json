The i-Con Smart Condom is billed as a new form of wearable technology (Photo: SWNS) \nIt’s a ring that will sit over a condom at the base, which you can use over and over again. \n\"It is extremely comfortable, water resistant and lightweight, you won’t even know it’s there ensuring maximum pleasure and, peace of mind,\" according to its manufacturers.
