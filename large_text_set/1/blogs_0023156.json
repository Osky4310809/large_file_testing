Share Save \nTurns out that Game Mode and streaming via Windows 10's built-in Beam app were only the tip of the update iceberg. A post on the Windows 10 blog also details a handful of extra additions for folks in the Windows Insider program. \nFirst up? In a move to further Windows' accessibility , the Edge browser can now read e-books aloud. Edge also has some colorful new emoji t replace the monochrome ones that'd show up on websites. Beyond that there's also support for subtitles during the setup process (again furthering the OS' accessibility features), a name for night mode that makes sense -- \"night light\" -- and a download progress bar for apps and games grabbed from the Windows Store. \nThere's a raft of quality-of-life improvements too like fixes for crashing apps, screen flickering and even stopping Edge from crashing while sharing PDFs.
