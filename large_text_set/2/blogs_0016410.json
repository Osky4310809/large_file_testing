Smith started off by complimenting CNN's Jim Acosta, the reporter who had a tense exchange with the president during a press conference Thursday at the White House.\n\"Treating Jim Acosta over there from CNN, an accomplished reporter, a guy I've never met, but a good reporter,\" Smith said. \"I mean, treating him like he's–I'm not even going to use the word, I'm not going to give Twitter it's–the love it needs.\"\nSmith said it is \"crazy\" what the public sees everyday from Trump on television.\n\"It's crazy what we're watching every day,\" he said. \"It's absolutely crazy. He keeps repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as we're some kind of fools for asking a question. Really? Your opposition was hacked and the Russians were responsible for it, and your people were on the phone with Russia on the same day it was happening and we're fools for asking the questions?\nSmith turned to look into the camera, appearing to be speaking directly to Trump, before continuing.\n\"No, sir,\" he said. \"We are not fools for asking these questions and we demand to know the answer to this question. You owe this to the American people. Your supporters will support you either way. If your people were on the phone with [inaudible] what were they saying?\"\nSmith told the president the public has a right to have answers and that there is no reason for him to \"put [reporters] down\" for asking questions that Americans want to know.\n\"We have a right to know,\" he said. \"We absolutely do and that you call us fake news and put us down like children for asking these questions on behalf of the American people is inconsequential.\"\n\"The people deserve that answer at the very least,\" Smith said.\nAcosta asked Trump at the press briefing Thursday about WikiLeaks and a statement he had made relating to fake news.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T17:09:09.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
