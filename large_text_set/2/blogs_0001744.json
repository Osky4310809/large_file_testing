And what a *HOT* price! \nBe on the lookout for Curious George, Corduroy, Paddington and Madeline Kohl’s Cares Books and Plush toys marked down to just $1.50 each! This is such a great buy if you’re able to find these as you can score a popular book AND a plush for just $3 – which is a whopping 70% off the original prices!\n\nThese would be great to snag and add to the gift closet for upcoming Birthdays, Christmas, etc.! Although clearance prices tend to vary by region, it is likely you will be able to find these as they have been found for the same price in VARIOUS states. Awesome!\n(Thanks, Sarah!) \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:24:06.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
