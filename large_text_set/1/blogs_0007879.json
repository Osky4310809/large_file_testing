Click the link below to read all of the delicious ways Boone worked java into her morning meal, but these are my personal favorites: In Yogurt: Stir a little cold brew (or cold, regular coffee) into Greek yogurt and top with berries and yogurt. Overnight Chia Pudding: Boone combined 1/2 cup cold brew coffee, 1/4 cup coconut milk beverage, 3 Tbsp. chia seeds, and 2 Tbsp. maple syrup for a tasty, wholesome, energy-packed AM treat. Redeye Gravy: This coffee-based gravy is super easy to make, and provides a nice, somewhat bitter counter flavor to salty breakfast ham. \nOf course, every single one of these coffee-packed meals should be consumed with a cup of coffee, because the whole point is to get more coffee into your life, so don’t forget to brew a little extra.
