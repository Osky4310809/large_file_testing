Adia I’m empty since you left me Trying to find a way to carry on I search myself and everyone To see where we went wrong ‘Cause there’s no one left to finger There’s no one here to blame There’s no one left to talk to, honey And there ain’t no one to buy our innocence ‘Cause we are born innocent Believe me Adia, we are still innocent It’s easy, we all falter Does it matter?// —“Adia” by Sarah McLachlan \nEver since I’ve left Christianity, I wondered why people would consent to be Christian. Why would you say that you’re nothing, that you’re a “worm,” that you’re a sinner deserving of hellfire, and you are completely dependent on the grace of God? It seems like such an emasculating thing to believe. Why would a Christian want to believe they are worthless? \nI think I’ve figured it out. And it’s something that most atheist circles don’t offer. I’m not saying they should offer it. I’m just trying to paint a map of the issue and the attraction of Christianity, the most-believed religion in the world, and why it might be (besides, of course, the fact that many believe it through force). \nHere’s the thing — we’re all innocent. What I mean is that, at some point, all of us were newborn babes. And then life happened to us. But we wouldn’t say that a baby was evil, right? Looking at its trajectory…it would be hard to point at one particular point and say, “the person became evil HERE.” Because when you understand the life in enough detail, you understand how it got from point a to point b, and it’s logical. It makes sense. Sure, people can do evil THINGS that hurt other people; that’s different. But the person themselves? Who they are seems, at every point, to naturally fall from the things that happened — hormones, life circumstances, etc. — to that baby when they were born. \nThat’s why the parents of some of the worst serial killers in the world have a hard time, sometimes, believing their kid is evil. Because parents are often the ones to see that trajectory up close. That’s why individuals who are living their story almost invariably think, no matter how bad what they do is, that they are innocent. \nBut there is that, and then there is the rule that innocent people don’t unnecessarily hurt other people. Innocent people are individuals that other people see as innocent people. And so on. Innocence is not just privately felt; it’s also culturally constructed. And when there is a picture of what an innocent person looks like a does that’s culturally constructed, there are trajectories of life (however they are caused) that won’t fit into that. When the trajectories of our lives don’t fit into the culturally constructed image of innocence, we become “guilty” or “evil” because we do not match up. \nUsually these constructions of innocence involve a measurement of how much we are harming other people. We care about the constructions of innocence to the extent that we care about and/or are connected to the people or group harmed or negatively affected by them. That’s why we can feel guilty even when, logically, we’re doing the right thing. Like, when I first left Christianity, I would feel guilty when I didn’t bow my head to pray before a meal with the rest of my Christian group, even though logically I was convinced I was doing the right thing. That is because the construction of innocence from the group was something that my own life’s trajectory veered away from, and because I cared about the people in the group and “harming” them by not joining the prayer and thus disrupting their sense of community, I felt guilt. \nSeveral years later, I no longer feel guilt, because I am not as connected to this group. I don’t care quite as much about their opinion, and I’m connected to another often fundamentally opposed group now. My opinion didn’t change, in either circumstance. What changed was the construction of innocence I prioritized. Am I still hurting religious people? To some extent, their feelings are hurt when I don’t bow in prayer with them. But in addition to my rational decision not to bow my head, my emotional identification with atheists I want to represent and defend insulates me from guilt over what I see about the inferior offense the prayers may be taking for me not to bow my head. \nThe fact that I can shift from one construction of innocence to another indicates to me that innocence is something that groups construct, even as it’s something that each of us, to an extent, are. I know I sound a bit deterministic, and maybe I am, but I simply cannot look at a life and not see how the life cannot, consistently, be explained by someone’s psychology, biology, and environment. That’s awkward, because I’ve read that the idea that we have free will can actually get people to act better, making it a necessary fiction in some ways, but even the idea of free will seems to work into deterministic mechanisms. Even though we hurt each other and help each other in ways that prompt us to build images of identities that are “innocent” and ones that are “evil,” we, ourselves, are all, in a manner of speaking, innocent products (at least, for the most part, as far as I can see) of our environments, our biology, our psychology, and the rest. There is no “ghost in the machine.” \nI’ll correct a misconception here — it might sound, to some, as if I am saying that because we are all, in a manner of speaking, innocent products of our environment, we should not condemn people or punish people for not measuring up to socially constructed ideas of what it looks like to be innocent. That is not at all what I’m saying. These socially constructed ideas of innocence are essential in making sure that individuals experience as little pain and as much pleasure in their lives as possible. They keep us alive, they allow us to thrive, and they are of extremely important practical benefit in every arena of our lives. When I say these ideals of innocence are constructed, I don’t mean that they are a game. If you don’t construct physical objects in this world, you will die, you will starve, and you will not have shelter — you and the others under your charge. The same is true if we fail to construct an ideal of innocence. Without a construction of an ideal of innocence and the pressure on a culture that comes from these constructions, people get hurt — murdered, raped, robbed, abused, etc. — and that results in real harm. So when I say they are constructed, I’m not saying they are unimportant or need to be eradicated. \nWhat I am saying is that most people don’t measure up to these constructions. I have never met someone who I can say, with confidence, measures up to any group’s construction of innocence consistently. Hasn’t happened. Sometimes I thought I had, but it turned out I just had to get to know them better before I realized I didn’t. \nSo we have this constant tension between the fact that we feel, deep down, that we’re good people — that we’re people as good as we were when we were newborn, because we know our life (usually) better than just about anyone around us, so we understand who we are and why we do what we do — we have this tension between that and this ideal of innocence constructed by social groups we are part of, connected to, and care about that we simply don’t match. Even worse, these ideals of innocence are often ones that we need others to fulfill themselves so that they don’t get hurt, which further connects us to them. That tension between the innocence we feel in ourselves and the innocence as constructed by our social groups — that difference — is what often (certainly not ALWAYS, as there are notable exceptions, but often enough) translates into guilt. \nNow, guilt is a useful mechanism, because guilt keeps us upholding that ideal of innocence, and if everyone in our group feels it, that acts as a barrier, a communal electric fence, to keep us from getting hurt. As psychologist and behavioral economist Dan Ariely has noted (see video below), we are all hypocrites, in the sense that we all cheat a little bit (or what we perceive as a little bit), which works, because that enriches our individual selves. As long as we don’t cheat A LOT (which guilt usually prevents in most group members), the ideal stays intact. \nBut because we all cheat a little bit, sooner or later you might get caught, and then the guilt starts to go into overdrive, because suddenly you are distanced from that ideal of innocence. Let me make this practical. I’ve met people who drink and drive occasionally. They’ll talk about it occasionally. It’s accepted; no big deal. But then one day they get caught, and their guilt spikes. Why are they feeling guilty now and not then? Because they got caught, and now they are publicly seen as the opposite of that ideal of innocence that had sought to uphold. \nWhat happens here is crucial. As Dan Ariely has noted, if you do wrong once and are chastened for it and then let back into the group, you are likely to recover. That works (start video at 7:42 and watch till the end for info). \nBut if someone does something wrong and becomes closed off from the group that constructed the violated ideal of innocence with no hope of recourse, then they seek or construct another ideal — one that will realize them for the truly innocent person they are. And they may keep doing that formerly wrong thing, feeling less and less bad about it because they are less and less connected to the group whose ideal of innocence made them feel guilty about it in the first place. \nThis gets complicated a bit here, because fear of being kicked out of the group can make people more strongly cling to the group’s ideal of innocence, making that ideal stronger. So there is value in various forms of excommunication (be it prison or some other form) as far as preserving the ideal of innocence is concerned. But if the individual kicked out has no path to be restored to the group and even become an upholder of that ideal of innocence, then there is a strong possibility that the individual will find a group that they will be restored to, one that will accept him, bad things they do and all. \nIt’s just the logic of human relationships. As far as I can see, that’s how it works. Have you ever been kicked out of a group before? And then blocked out when you tried to join? What did you do? Maybe got depressed for awhile and then, as the years passed, found a group that would allow you to express yourself, right? Like, this happens all the time. If it hasn’t happened to you, talk to someone it has happened to. \nGiven that setup, Christianity’s staying power is simple. \nIt has an extreme ideal — Christ, eternity, heaven, etc. You couldn’t set this ideal any higher, and Christians sure have tried. And it has made that ideal essential to the well-being of the group — if you don’t join it, you spend eternity in hellfire. \nNow, here’s the deal. Those extremes are so extreme that you don’t have to wholeheartedly believe them. You can cheat a little bit — every Christian probably does. What counts more is that this is a construction from a group that you are connected to, so that even if it’s factually inaccurate, the construction from the group remains. And it’s far more epic than a lot of other ways of thinking. \nThen there’s the powerful deterrent. If you don’t match up to the ideal, you deserve hellfire. And then there’s the powerful restoration — because the constructed ideal itself has taken that position of disgrace and condemnation, and returned to become the ideal, you can become the ideal, too. \nIt might sound like I’m trying to preach a sermon here, but I’m not. I hate the constructed ideal. It’s bullshit, and it usually hurts a hell of a lot of people. I’m just explaining why I think it works. \nIn a lot of atheists circles, however, I’ve seen that if you violate the guidelines of the ideal construction (whatever it is in your group) and get caught, there isn’t necessarily any recourse. There isn’t necessarily any way back. It’s a mark that doesn’t leave. And I believe I’ve seen atheists turn back to Christianity for that reason. I don’t really want to name individual names at the moment (I may later), but it definitely happens. \n“But,” you say, “Atheism is growing. Christianity is losing.” \nWell, kinda. 2 out of 10 people raised in religious homes will likely become nonreligious. Truth has a way of breaking through in this computer age. But the other news is that 4 out of 10 people raised in nonreligious homes will likely become religious . The reason it looks like we’re winning now is partly because there are just so many more religious people, so that their 20% is much higher in number than our 40%. \nShould there be a way back for atheists who have not lived up to community-constructed ideals of innocence? I don’t know. There is an argument to be made that this might be letting people back in the henhouse to harm people, as we see Catholic priests who are moved from parish to parish to molest young boys. There is also an argument to be made that these outcasts simply make their own communities (cf. the increasing influence of the anti-SJW movement in opposition to the SJW movement in organized atheism, as one example my audience is likely familiar with) in which they are no longer outcasts, which can also negatively impact the prominence of certain ideals of innocence and, by extension, hurt the people these ideals were built to protect. \nIt’s a tough place. And I don’t have the answer. Really. For the most part, I’ve been on the side that has been firmly against letting people disgraced in organized atheism back in, because I don’t trust people easily and I don’t want to see people get hurt (and sometimes they don’t want to come back, anyway). I still am likely on that side. But at the same time, this stance comes with the understanding that Christians, who often have a clear way back for many of their disgraced, have an advantage. \nThis understanding has also gotten me to think a bit more when I complain about how subservient Christianity makes people feel. The downside to this subservience, this feeling that you deserve hellfire and would get it if it were not for the grace of Christ, is that it allows people to be controlled like puppets in deeply disturbing ways that continue to make me angry. But the reason this religion is so stubborn is not in spite of that hellhole, but BECAUSE of it, as it acts as a deterrent from leaving the constructed ideal of Christ that it also validates, and the fact that the ideal includes or encompasses that hellhole rinses away the person’s guilt and restores them to the group. It’s a bit like the reason I’ve read people get addicted to drinking — often it’s not just the drinking itself, so much as it’s the thrill of how drinking causes you to veer away from an ideal of innocence and then come back to the group that constructed that ideal upon becoming sober (and, truth be told, often when drunk). That thrill of realizing that that deep innocence you feel in yourself has found a secure home in a community, even when it does not match up with the externally constructed ideal. That ideal contains your veering away from it. It’s still there when you mess up. The conscienceless people take advantage of this, and those with consciences feel connected by it. \nAgain, I don’t know how or if this applies to atheism. I’ve been thinking about it. It just seems to be an explanation for how Christianity has grown so powerful around the world, and also for how it is an ideology that seems constructed to fight other ideologies and overcome them. I don’t know what to do with this reality, but it seems that in our future fights it would help to take it into consideration. \nThanks for reading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T03:12:50.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
