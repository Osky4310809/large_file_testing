And while it might be tempting to line up your favorite love ballads and listen to them until you’ve cried all your tears out, I recommend a different approach. \nTake a page out of Selena Gomez’s book and vindicate the situation for yourself. Gomez recently released an epic diss track with Kygo geared at ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber, and it’s freaking awesome. \nWhy not make a playlist for yourself of some of the most inspiring and satisfying tunes that’ll help you get over your old flame and MOVE ON , girl? \nFocus on songs that reflect self-love, independence and shaking off the haters. \nTo get you started, here are 12 awesome songs about forgetting your ex: \nAnd here’s why you need them in your life: “Love Myself,” Hailee Steinfeld \nYour mantra: I love me, gonna love myself, no I don’t need anybody else / I know how to scream my own name \nWhy you should listen to it: It reminds you of the importance of self-love , and honestly… masturbating . This song is literally about masturbating. Both SUPER GREAT things to do and think about after a breakup. “Send My Love (To Your New Lover),” Adele \nYour mantra: I’m giving you up / I’ve forgiven it all / You set me free \nWhy you should listen to it: You’ll feel empowered, mature and strong, and it will help you realize you are better off without your deadbeat ex . “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” Taylor Swift \nYour mantra: We are never getting back together. Like, ever. \nWhy you should listen to it: IDK, CAUSE IT FEELS GOOD?! WHY DO ANY OF US EVER LISTEN TO T-SWIFT?! She’s made a career out of breakup songs, so obviously she made this list. “Love Yourself,” Justin Bieber \nYour mantra: Cause if you like the way you look that much / Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself / And if you think that I’m still holdin’ onto somethin’ / You should go and love yourself \nWhy you should listen to it: Because it’s a subtle, little “fuck you” to your old flame, and celebrates being secure and confident in yourself. “Fuck You,” CeeLo Green \nYour mantra: I’m like fuck you / and fuck her too \nWhy you should listen to it: Because shouting “FUCK YOU” at someone who hurt you feels great, obviously. “With A Little Help From My Friends,” The Beatles \nYour mantra: I get by with a little help from my friends / I get high with a little help from my friends \nWhy you should listen to it: To celebrate the other amazing people in your life and reflect on how lucky and full your life is, regardless of if your ex is in it or not. “Somebody That I Used To Know,” Gotye \nYour mantra: I guess that I don’t need that though / Now you’re just somebody that I used to know \nWhy you should listen to it: Because it’s gritty and angsty, and probably reflects a lot of the feelings you have about your breakup. Plus, there is something really satisfying about minimizing an old lover to “somebody that you used to know.” “Bad Girls,” M.I.A. \nYour mantra: Live fast / die young / bad girls do it well \nWhy you should listen to it: For a dose of kickass girl power, strength and bad assery. “Dog Days Are Over,” Florence + The Machine \nYour mantra: Leave all your love and your longing behind you / Can’t carry it with you if you want to survive \nWhy you should listen to it: This song totally exemplifies the clouds parting and the sun coming in. The dog days are over, honey. MOVE ON. “Independent Women,” Destiny’s Child \nYour mantra: All the women who are independent / Throw your hands up at me / All the honeys who makin’ money / Throw your hands up at me \nWhy you should listen to it: Because Destiny’s Child knows you don’t need anybody but yourself, queen. Feed off their fierceness, and be lifted by their strength. “Tears Dry On Their Own,” Amy Winehouse \nYour mantra: I shouldn’t play myself again / I should just be my own best friend / Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men \nWhy you should listen to it: Because Amy Winehouse exemplifies everything strong, powerful, brave and soulful. Follow her to emotional freedom, guys. “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” Beyoncé Columbia Records \nYour mantra: Who the fuck do you think I is? / You ain’t married to no average bitch boy / You can watch my fat ass twist boy / As I bounce to the next dick boy \nWhy you should listen to it: I mean… how can you NOT listen to it to get over your ex? She says, “AS I BOUNCE TO THE NEXT DICK, BOY” STRAIGHT TO HER HUSBAND, JAY Z . \nHello? Confidence? Yes, please. It’s also great to just feel some RAGE every now and then. (Also, this song is only on Tidal.) “Sorry,” also Beyoncé \nYour mantra: Middle fingers up, put them hands high / wave it in his face, tell him boy, bye \nWhy you should listen to it: It totally summarizes what you’re going through right now. Boyfriend? What boyfriend? Boy, be gone. We were mad before, but you’re irrelevant now. You don’t need this anymore and are moving on with Serena Williams and you bad ass posse. Actually, just listen to the entirety of Lemonade by Beyoncé. \nBecause it is the cure for everything, but especially relationships gone wrong . \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
