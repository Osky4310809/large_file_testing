Sufi cleric and leader of the Minhaj-ul-Quran religious organization, Muhammad Tahirul Qadri, has held several lectures at the Community Centre, located just west Toronto, Ontario. Qadri recently returned to Pakistan after living in Canada for several years to lead a call for reforms that has made him an instant hit among Pakistanis disillusioned with the state.

REUTERS/Mark Blinch Visiting Imam At Montreal Mosque Preaches About Muslims Killing Jews TOP 5549112 \nAs Parliament debates a motion that would condemn Islamophobia, a video has surfaced of a Jordanian imam in a Montreal mosque preaching about Muslims killing Jews. \nSheikh Muhammad bin Musa Al Nasr was the guest of honor at the Dar Al-Arqam Mosque on Dec. 23, 2016 when he gave the sermon. \nMontreal police are investigating and may charge the leadership of the mosque with a hate crime. \nIn the video, the imam says in Arabic, “O Muslim, O servant of Allah, O Muslim, O servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.” The chant is well-known in the Muslim faith because it is an Islamic hadith — a series of phrases and reflections on the Muslim prophet Mohammad. \nB’nai Brith Canada expressed outrage and wondered why a mosque located in the center of Canada’s second largest city would first invite such an inflammatory imam to speak in the first place and then post his hateful remarks to the internet. They are asking the Montreal Police to investigate the Mosque for hate crimes. \n“This is inciting violence, and this is inciting radicalization,” said Harvey Levine, regional director of B’nai Brith in Quebec. \n“It’s against the law and has to be stopped,” he told CBC Montreal, noting that their complaint has been registered with the Montreal hate crimes unit. \nThe mosque, located in the Montreal suburb of Saint-Michel, invited the imam to speak. The mosque’s leadership apparently took no issue with Al Nasr’s comments because they posted a video of his “sermon” on YouTube, where it has been viewed by thousands. \nNo one was responding to questions on Wednesday when CBC Montreal called for comment and the Montreal police confirmed it has received a complaint, but would not provide any more information. \nThe president of the Muslim Council of Montreal, Salam Elmenyawi, said he didn’t know why the imam was invited to speak to at the mosque and suggested the mosque’s leadership might apologize for the remarks about killing Jews. \nHe claimed he does not represent the Dar Al-Arqam Mosque that his council does speak for 40 other such facilities. \nThis is not the first complaint that B’nai Brith has filed with local police in recent weeks. Levine said this is the second time in just 40 days that they have asked Montreal’s hate crime unit to investigate a city mosque. \nHe said the police still haven’t concluded their investigation into the first matter and have not filed any charges. Levine wonders what is taking the police so long. \n“This is totally unacceptable. We want to know why the hate crimes unit has not done something to date yet. This person should be arrested and charged for hate crimes,” said Levine .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:37:22.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
