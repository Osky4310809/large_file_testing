By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 12, 2017 8:14 AM Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has today rejected allegations by BJP supremo Mayawati of EVMs being allegedly manipulated. (ANI) \nUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has today rejected allegations by BJP supremo Mayawati of EVMs being allegedly manipulated. Speaking to ANI, he said that allegations were all false and the BSP supremo must accept the results. He also said that the BJP won the elections in the state because it was popular among voters of Uttar Pradesh. Arun Jaitley further said that a lot of work has been done by the Narendra Modi -led Goevrnment, which helped the BJP to win elections. \nDecimated in Uttar Pradesh, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati on Saturday alleged that EVMs didn’t accept any votes accept the ones in favour of Bharatiya Janata Party. Addressing media, Mayawati questioned how votes in Muslim-dominated areas went in favour of BJP. Mayawati’s statement came just after her party suffered shocking defeat in state Assembly polls. “I have written to Election Commission in this regard, people no more have faith in EVM machines,” Mayawati said. “Most votes in Muslim majority constituencies have gone to BJP, makes it evident that voting machines were manipulated,” she added. “Either the EVMs did not accept votes other than BJP, or the votes of other parties have gone to BJP in the EVMs,” said BSP supremo. \nMayawati said this trend will have a “very bad bearing” on democracy in the country and will amount to crushing it. \n“The results in UP and Uttarakhand are surprising and not palatable to anyone…it seems EVMs did not accept votes polled for any party other than BJP,” she said. “It is a matter of common discussion here that even if button is pressed for any other party, vote will be polled in favour of BJP,” Mayawati said. The BSP chief claimed that a similar complaint was made by her partymen in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls but she had preferred to stay silent thinking it was Modi wave and anti- Congress sentiment. \nShe said it was “unacceptable” that the BJP was winning even in Muslim-dominated areas. “Muslims constitute 20 per cent votes in the state and the BJP did not give a single ticket to Muslims…but in Muslim- dominated seats also the results went in the BJP’s favour and this is unpalatable to the party,” she said. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nThe BSP chief said that she has written a letter to the Election Commission in this regard and demanded that the declaration of results should be immediately stopped and fresh polls be held in the state using paper ballots after an impartial inquiry into the EVMs. \nBSP, which has been completely rejected by people, fell from 80 seats to 20 seats in the elections. However, as per the Election Commission of India, BJP has secured 40 per cent vote share, BSP has bagged 22 per cent, while SP has also managed to get around 22 per cent seats.
