They were scheduled to perform two sets at Yoshi’s, the jazz club that borders the transit hub, and a venue where the band plays frequently.\n“In an unfortunate accident tonight, two members of the award-winning group Tower Of Power, drummer David Garibaldi and current bassist Marc Van Wageningen, were struck by a train in California,” said manager Jeremy Westby in a statement. “Both men are responsive and being treated at a local hospital in Oakland.”\nSheila E., the legendary drummer and frequent Tower of Power collaborator, sent out a call for well wishes on Twitter.\nPlease pray for my frenz,Bassist Marc Van Wageningen, drummer Dave GARIBALDI for tower power hit by a train in front of Yoshi's in Oakland\n— SheilaEdrummer (@SheilaEdrummer) January 13, 2017 \nTower of Power helped put the Bay Area on the soul-funk map in the ’70s, rising to international fame alongside fellow Oakland natives Sly and the Family Stone. Though the band also experienced its greatest commercial success in that decade, Tower of Power has continued touring extensively up through the present with a rotating cast of members. After several shows at Yoshi’s, their next scheduled show on this tour was Jan. 20 at a Harrah’s casino in Laughlin, Nevada.\n\nGaribaldi originally joined Tower of Power on drums in 1970, sometimes taking breaks from the band over the years but generally considered a lifetime member. Van Wageningen had recently stepped in to relieve founding bassist Francis “Rocco” Prestia, who has battled health issues in recent years.
