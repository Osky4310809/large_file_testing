Dolan said he suspects Oakley may have a drinking problem, which the former Knick also denied.\nThe Knicks have received blow-back from the ban, including demands from Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams and Rev. Al Sharpton to drop the ban and charges against Oakley. Sharpton said in a statement on Monday his National Action Network will organize a group to picket outside of the Garden if the situation isn’t reolved.\nAt a press conference on Monday afternoon, Adams said a scheduled meeting with Dolan was postponed after he was told “new developments” arose.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:45:47.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
