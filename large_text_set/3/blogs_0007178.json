In  her speech , Campbell looked back to acknowledge and thank the female trailblazers and male enablers who had helped clear her path.\nThe House adjourned that afternoon and by late summer the country was in an election campaign and, well, everyone knows how that turned out for Campbell and the Progressive Conservatives. She would never sit in the House of Commons as prime minister.\nBut on Wednesday morning, to mark International Women’s Day, Campbell returned to the floor of the House of Commons for the first time since that summer day in 1993, and this time she came as the trailblazer, with an inspiring speech that looked forward to a day when having a female prime minister would not be such an odd and remarkable thing.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean KilpatrickKim Campbell, 19th Prime Minister of Canada, addresses the Daughters of the Vote (DOV) event, organized by Equal Voice Canada, as it takes place in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday, March 8, 2017. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick ORG XMIT: SKP106 Kim Campbell, 19th Prime Minister of Canada, addresses the Daughters of the Vote (DOV) event in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday, March 8, 2017. The House of Commons is normally empty on Wednesday mornings but on this Wednesday it was full, every single one of the seats occupied by a young woman, one aspiring female politician from each of the country’s 338 ridings. They had arrived in Ottawa as part of the “ Daughters Of the Vote ”, program, an initiative of the group Equal Voice , which works to encourage, support, and remove barriers to women who want to run for any political office.\n“It is a glorious sight to see you all here,” Campbell began. “It is so touching and I know that over the coming years, this sight of young women filling the seats is going to become more and more natural. We will make room for our male colleagues. We won’t take all of the seats. We’ll share. Women do that. But this is a remarkable and and very touching vision for anyone who has served in this chamber.”\nWhile Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made it a point of filling his cabinet with equal numbers of men and women, achieving gender parity in the legislature is more difficult. And while all parties now, to one degree or another, have programs to encourage women to seek nominations and run for office, just one in four MPs are women in the current  House of Commons, pretty much the same ratio as that after the 2011 election and only a  bit better than the 22 per cent after the 2008 election who were female MPs.\nAs Trudeau himself said when he addressed the “Daughters of the Vote” group in the House of Commons, “We have much work to do.”\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivered a speech at a Daughters of the Vote (DOV) event in the House of Commons on Wednesday. In her speech, Campbell reflected on gender gains large and small made since her day.\n“I’m doing something right now I never did when I sat in the House of Commons. I am wearing a pantsuit,” she said. And indeed she was. It was black.\n“This may surprise you to know that when I was a member of Parliament twenty odd years ago, a “business dress” is the dress that you’re supposed to wear and women never wore trousers in the House of Commons. We can thank people like Hillary Clinton, Angela Merkel — whose uniform is a jacket and trousers — people who have regularized and normalized jackets and trousers for women in politics and women political leaders.”\nShe also touched on a debate still not yet fully resolved for current parliamentarians: Making the House of Commons a “family-friendly” workplace. MPs in the current Parliament have already considered, for instance, trimming the Parliamentary work week by a day so that MPs would have an extra day in their ridings with their families and constituents. Other ideas have been discussed but, so far at least, MPs have not yet acted on them.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Kim Campbell, 19th Prime Minister of Canada, addresses the Daughters of the Vote (DOV) event, organized by Equal Voice Canada, as it takes place in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday, March 8, 2017. Still, as Campbell noted, changes made since her day — eliminating late night votes, for example — make it more likely that more women will run.\n“It isn’t just women who want a saner life. Men also want to go home to their families. The civilizing quality of life in the House of Commons benefits everybody,” Campbell said. “It’s not something just for women but women are more likely to speak up and say, ‘Why are we doing this? This is ridiculous.”\nRelated Tories’ ex-PM brain trust helping steer party: Mulroney, Campbell, Clark all advising interim chief Tasha Kheiriddin: Spare us the fawning — Trudeau appointed just three more women to cabinet than Harper did Canadian gender equality under threat from ‘society of immigration’: Former PM Kim Campbell Campbell closed her speech with a story of how bureaucrats struggled over her French title when she became PM. Every one else who had held the office was le premier ministre  — the masculine version of the English noun ‘prime minister’. In France, they stick with the masculine regardless of the gender of the person holding the job. So in Paris, female ministers are greeted with, “ Bonjour le ministre .” But in Canada, we would go a different way, at the insistence, Campbell said, of her French teacher  and she would be known as la premiere ministre , the feminine form of prime minister.\n“So we had some stationery printed and on the top of that stationery it said Prime Minister / Premiere Ministre . Now, I wasn’t in office very long so I didn’t get to use all the stationery. And I think that somewhere in the Langevin Block (the building housing the office of the prime minister), perhaps in an old stationery cupboard, there is a box of stationery waiting for somebody.” On all sides of the House, the young women began to clap. “I hope one of you will use it.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:31:28.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
