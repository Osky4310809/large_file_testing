ADVERTISEMENT \nBut that didn’t stop Herndon from unleashing another standout performance with his 20 points, eight rebounds, five assists, and two steals. \nThat has been the norm in this conference for the 22-year-old San Francisco State alumnus, averaging 18.8 points, 8.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists, and 1.8 steals through six games for Victoria. \nHerndon’s stupendous play has allowed him to turn the heads of some scouts, which bodes well as he hopes to make some noise in anticipation of the 2017 PBA Rookie Draft. \n“I’ve always had a dream to come here and continue my basketball career,” he said. “That’s what I’m trying to do. I just work hard and I want to help my team win. I don’t care too much about my stats and how many times I scored, but I just want to do what it takes to win.” \nUnfortunately, as promising as his numbers have been, they haven’t been translated into win shares yet for newcomer Victoria, as he finds himself near the cellar of the 2017 PBA D-League Aspirants’ Cup standings. \nStill, Herndon thinks that his team still has time to make a turnaround, the same way he believes he can adapt to the style of play and take the leadership role for the squad wholeheartedly. \n“I feel that I need to step up every game,” he said. “I’m still trying to get used to the calls. But it’s a different kind of ball game here than it is in the United States. And I got to get used to that. I would say I’m pretty much getting the feel for it and I’m starting to fit in.” \nHerndon continued: “We’re a young team and some say we’re inexperienced. It’s the first time a lot of these players played here, including myself. But the coaches look up to me to be the leader on and off the court. I feel I need to bring my A-game every game. I love to win and I love to compete. And one thing’s for sure: I will do whatever it takes to win.” \nVictoria Sports returns to action on Tuesday against Cignal-San Beda. /atm", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:16:58.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
