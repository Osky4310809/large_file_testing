It is aimed at children aged from five to 10.\nThe book tells the story of Jack, a farm boy, and Leo, a prince, who meet in the enchanted forest and slowly fall in love. But their budding relationship hits a hurdle when the Queen’s evil husband, Gideon, attempts to seize the enchanted forest, which is on land belonging to Jack’s family.\nView this image ›\nSupplied\nID: 10547830 Harris (right) told BuzzFeed News it seemed fitting to dedicate the book to the victims of the Orlando shooting , as the massacre occurred the day after they finished the book.\n“We locked off our text, said ‘That’s done’, handed it to the illustrators, and then that happened,” he said.\nHarris said he was deeply shaken by reports the killer had said he was disgusted by two men kissing.\n“I was personally very affected by it,” he said. “There was a vigil here in Wellington that I went along to.
