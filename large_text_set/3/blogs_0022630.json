I mean, I think it was but I honestly can‚Äôt even remember anymore.\nAll I know is that my stomach is full of butterflies and my heart is racing because on Tuesday afternoon, Ventimiglia blessed his Twitter followers by revealing a trove of tech-related confessions, ultimately revealing himself as a hardcore Apple fanboy. \nWho. Would. Have. Guessed. \nThough Ventimiglia has captured the hearts of basically everyone in his recent role of Jack in This Is Us , most of his ride-or-die fans (me) fell in love with him when he played the angsty, book-loving Jess Mariano on Gilmore Girls in 2001 (or even before that breakout role). \nThis means we knew him before we knew Apple, before we knew iPhones, and really, before tech ran our lives. So seeing him pledge his loyalty to a modern day tech company is just ~woah~. \nAnywho, back to the tweets. Tweet 1: The AirPods \nOn Tuesday afternoon, Milo, being the adorable and tame little guy that he is, stopped in a parking lot to squat and take a selfie next to the trunk of a Volvo. As one does. \nWhy? Well, because he got a ‚Äúprime parking spot and a welcome sign‚Äù when he pulled into the lot and wanted to give his fans a shout-out. He posed with a ‚ÄúLVUJACK‚Äù license plate ‚Äî which obviously references his This Is Us character, Jack, and nothing else in this world. \nThis was very cute. But the real takeaway here is that Milo is sporting Apple AirPods in this picture, which means he uses AirPods and AirPods‚Ä¶are‚Ä¶COOL. Tweet 2: Milo is down to do an Apple commercial \nAs Milo fans across the world debated whether or not the actor was blasting ‚ÄúDeath With Dignity‚Äù by Sufjan Stevens, or IDK, maybe some Bj√∂rk on his AirPods, Mashable Business Reporter Emma Hinchliffe tweeted the question on everyone‚Äôs mind: \nBecause Milo loves Apple so much, he swiftly answered her question, and we know it came from him because he signed the tweet with his classic ‚ÄúMV‚Äù signature. üòç \n‚ÄúThey doing those?‚Äù he asked about the commercials before explaining he‚Äôd love to be featured in one. He pledged his loyalty to the tech company and asked if Apple is on board with this brilliant plan. \nApple, you up? Tweet 3: Milo‚Äôs forgotten Apple commercial \nMilo acted like he was totally down to make a commercial with Apple, which led us all to believe he had never made one, but Kevin T. Porter, star of the legendary Gilmore Guys podcast, seems to remember otherwise. \nPorter replied to Milo‚Äôs tweet explaining that, though it may have slipped the actor‚Äôs memory, a young Ventimiglia had already given a riveting Apple commercial performance in the past. He even LINKED. THE. VIDEO. \nIf you take any shred of joy away from 2017, let it be Milo‚Äôs forgotten Apple commercial, ‚ÄúCool Plane Guy.‚Äù The greatest minute-long comedic yet dramatic cinematic production you may ever lay eyes on, with Milo showing off his brand new iBook on an airplane and jamming out to the hit 2000 anthem ‚ÄúWho Let The Dogs Out‚Äù. \nNo word yet from Apple on a future collab with Milo, but this has been a great day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:57:15.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
