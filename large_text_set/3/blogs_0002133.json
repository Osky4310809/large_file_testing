And they're getting the best youngster available for the job. Former Ateneo de Manila University superstar Kiefer Ravena will be lending his wares to the Philippine crew in the Asean Basketball League. Ravena, who is coming from a tour of duty with Mighty Sports, will be joining fellow UAAP star Bobby Ray Parks Jr., who is currently serving as Alab's captain. The 23-year-old guard is concurrently a developmental player for the Texas Legends in the NBA's developmental league. Also a former collegiate league MVP like Parks, Ravena will bolster a backcourt crew that features former PBA cagers Jeric Fortuna, Paulo Hubalde, Jens Knuttel and Anthony Gavieres. Alab, which is currently enjoying the third place in the ABL ladder, will stake its 8-6 card against the Saigon Heat this Friday at the latter's home court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:03:33.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
