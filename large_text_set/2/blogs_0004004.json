Last April, for example, it added more than 2,000 new words. Among them: \"FOMO\" (fear of missing out), \"athleisure,\" \"bitcoin,\" and \"meet-cute.\" \nThe dictionary also puts out an annual Word of the Year. Though \"irregardless,\" \"bigly,\" and \"revenant\" were all close contenders, the official 2016 word was \"surreal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:36:40.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
