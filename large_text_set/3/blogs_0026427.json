Here are some interesting facts about The King's famous home.\nSixty years ago this week, Elvis Presley purchased the sprawling property known as Graceland, which is now one of the most popular homes to visit in America. With the urging of his parents, Presley bought Graceland due to his rising star status and his need for privacy. \nCheck out some of these interesting facts about the historic site.\nElvis strolls around Graceland, circa 1957. 1. Elvis paid $102,500 for Graceland â€” an equivalent of about $880,380 today.\n2. When Elvis purchased Graceland, the property was just shy of 14 acres and a little over 10,000 square feet. Today the mansion occupies over 17,500 square feet.\n3. Graceland has five sets of stairs.\n4. Graceland is the second most visited home in the United States, with over 700,000 visitors to boast annually. The first? The White House. \n5. The original owners, The Moores, gave Graceland its name, which was in honor of Mrs. Moore's aunt, Grace Toof. \n6. Besides Elvis' love for fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches, he insisted that there be cans of sauerkraut, fresh banana pudding, and Doublemint gum stocked in the kitchen at all times. \n7. Bruce Springsteen was one of many young men who trespassed onto Graceland in hopes of meeting The King. Unfortunately for him, Elvis wasn't even home at the time of Springsteen's daring (and illegal) act. \n8. A portion of Graceland's upstairs area is forbidden to the public. It was a private place where Elvis found solace from the outside world.\n9.
