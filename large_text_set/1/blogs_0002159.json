That's why we're looking for the union, because the idea that we all have is that the Committee is attached to the federation,\" the center back said. \"That's why we're looking for something independent, that might come from the players and not be part of the federation.\" \nThe Liga MX Clausura starts Friday. Marquez's Atlas takes the field Sunday with a road trip to Toluca to open its campaign.
