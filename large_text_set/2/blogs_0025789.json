In 2015 U.S. CEOs earned 335 times the pay  of the average worker. In the U.K.  they earn 129 times more ; the High Pay Centre marked “Fat Cat Wednesday” (January 4, 2017) as the day by when a CEO has already earned more than an average worker earns in the entire year.\nThis ratio is the number one piece of evidence that executive pay is excessive and the number one statistic that advocates of pay reform argue should be fixed. Accordingly, the Dodd–Frank Act is forcing U.S. firms to disclose this ratio from this year; the U.K. is contemplating similar legislation. The world’s largest investor, BlackRock,  wants to move beyond simply disclosing pay ratios, to capping the ratio of some forms of pay. It recently wrote to over 300 UK companies to say it would only approve salary increases for top executives if worker wages increased by a similar amount.\nRelated Video CEOs Get Paid Too Much A survey showed that CEOs worldwide are making exponentially more money than people think they should. Save Share See More Videos > See More Videos > The idea is that a high pay ratio is unfair. It indicates that the CEO is being disproportionately rewarded, supposedly at the expense of other workers. Forcing disclosure will shame firms into lowering the ratio; investors, customers, and employees can boycott firms with overpaid bosses.\nI strongly believe that executive pay should be reformed. My own research demonstrates the substantial benefits to firms of treating their workers fairly. However, disclosure of pay ratios may have unintended consequences that actually end up hurting workers. A CEO wishing to improve the ratio may outsource low-paid jobs, hire more part-time than full-time workers, or invest in automation rather than labor. She may also raise workers’ salaries but slash other benefits; importantly, pay is only one dimension of what a firm provides. Research shows that, after salary reaches a (relatively low) level, workers value nonpecuniary factors more highly, such as on-the-job training, flexible working conditions, and opportunities for advancement. Indeed, a high pay ratio can indicate promotion opportunities, which motivates rather than demotivates workers. A snapshot measure of a worker’s current pay is a poor substitute for their career pay within the firm.\nThe pay ratio is also a misleading statistic because CEOs and workers operate in very different markets, so there is no reason for their pay to be linked — just as a solo singer’s pay bears no relation to a bassist’s pay. This consideration explains why CEO pay has risen much more than worker pay. As an analogy, baseball player Alex Rodriguez was not clearly more talented than Babe Ruth, but he was paid far more because baseball had become a much bigger, more global industry by the time he was playing. Even if the best player is only slightly better than the next-best player at that position, the slight difference can have a huge effect on the team’s fortunes and revenues.\nJust as the baseball industry has gotten bigger, so have firms (also due to the global marketplace), and so it is worth paying top dollar for top talent. Average firm size in the Fortune 500 today is $20 billion. Thus, even if a CEO contributes only 1% more to firm value than the next-best alternative, this contribution is worth $200 million — much higher than the $10 million average salary. Gabaix and Landier show that the sixfold increase in CEO pay since 1980 can be explained by the sixfold increase in firm size.\nThe same argument does not apply to average workers. A CEO’s actions are scalable. For example, if the CEO improves corporate culture, it can be rolled out firm-wide, and thus has a larger effect in a larger firm. One percent is $20 million in a $2 billion firm, but $200 million in a $20 billion firm. In contrast, most employees’ actions are less scalable. An engineer who has the capacity to service 10 machines creates, say, $50,000 of value regardless of whether the firm has 100 or 1,000 machines. In short, CEOs and employees compete in very different markets, one that scales with firm size and one that scales less.\nIn addition to creating misleading comparisons between firms of different size, the pay ratio is not comparable across different industries. It is lower in investment banks than supermarkets — but that’s because midlevel bankers are paid well rather than because banking executives are paid poorly. Even within an industry, average pay depends on which countries a firm operates in and its mix of capital and labor.\nThus, I fully share the aim behind pay ratios, which is to consider other stakeholders. But this aim is best achieved by encouraging CEOs to increase the pie for all, rather than shrinking CEOs’ share of the pie. The best way to do this is to link pay to the long-run stock price. Research shows that improving employee satisfaction increases the stock price by 2%–3% per year in the long run — that’s $400–$600 million in the average Fortune 500 firm, which is much greater than the amount that can be saved by reducing CEO pay.\nMoreover, unlike the pay ratio, the long-run stock price takes into account other stakeholders , such as customers and the environment. Firms with greater stock-priced compensation beat their peers by 4%–10% per year , and implementing long-run stock compensation improves not only profitability and innovation but also the stewardship of customers, the environment, society, and, in particular, employees. Large-scale studies in both the U.S . and the  UK  have independently found that the pay ratio is positively correlated with long-term performance — pie expansion — due to either attracting talented managers or incentivizing them to grow the pie.\nIn addition, disclosing the pay ratio is costly. The SEC estimates a first-year implementation cost of $1.3 billion and ongoing annual costs that exceed $52o million. Foreign subsidiaries typically have a different payroll system, and transporting payroll data to the U.S. headquarters is expensive.\nSo, what kind of disclosures might actually help? One is focusing on a CEO’s hypothetical net pay, rather than their gross pay. This captures the effect that income tax already has in reducing inequality. Of course, the actual net pay will depend on the CEO’s own tax position, which we won’t know, but applying the federal tax rates gives a much better approximation than gross pay.\nAnother is the sensitivity of the CEO’s wealth to firm performance. There is a common misperception, promoted by many incorrect studies , that CEOs aren’t punished for poor performance because their salary and bonus don’t change much with performance. All of these studies incorrectly ignore the substantial incentives that come from a CEO’s equity holdings. If the stock price falls by 10%, the average Fortune 500 CEO loses millions of dollars. Firms should report the CEO’s gain or loss from her equity holdings. There will be large losses in underperforming firms, showing society that CEOs are punished for poor performance.\nA third idea is to share an industry-adjusted dollar increase in firm value. If a firm beat its peers by 5%, that’s $1 billion in a $20 billion firm. Of course, not all of that $1 billion will be due to the CEO. But this $1 billion provides a benchmark against which to compare the pay of $10 million, to decide whether it’s fair. If it’s plausible that the CEO is responsible for 1% of the value increase, then her pay is fair; otherwise, it’s not.\nThe fourth is the horizon of the CEO’s pay. Firms can disclose the vesting schedule of incentives. For example, a CEO with $1 million of equity vesting in one year and $10 million in five years is likely to have a longer-term outlook than one with the reverse. Such a disclosure will significantly increase transparency, making it clear how much and when the CEO is paid.\nIn sum, let’s move away from the pie-splitting mentality of pay ratios, and toward the pie-enlarging mindset of value creation. Rather than bringing the CEO’s pay down, reform should incentivize the CEO to bring everyone else’s up.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:17:14.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
