If you want the look to be flawless and have it last [throughout the day], you do have to take a little extra time to make that happen.\" Melania Trump with her makeup artist, Nicole Bryl.

It makes it that much easier for the rest of us to team together and execute her vision.\" \nBryl adds, \"I look forward to seeing what she has decided to wear. It's always a treat to be a part of her impeccable beauty creation.\" \nBe a trendsetter!
