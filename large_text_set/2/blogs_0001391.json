Remember those leaked emails which had exposed Kangana and Hrithik’s cheesy conversations? Although Hrithik soon rubbished the emails stating it was not him but his imposter. Talking to Mid-day newspaper, Kangana Ranaut, now, has talked about the infamous incident and those leaked emails. She says, “I was dragged to court for being who I am. I was restricted to a relationship that was [carried out] behind closed doors and I fought it fair and square. People [can] talk rubbish, but they can’t decide how I lead my life. I felt stigmatised. I would wake up to [media reports] of hideous mails, which I hadn’t written. I am a certified screenwriter from the New York Film Academy. I don’t write such crap (laughs).” \nShe adds, “Someone I once shared a beautiful equation with did it… and with such malice. It hurt me”. She speaks of receiving a legal notice, demanding an apology for the claims she made in public. “I refused. I never completely understood the story — who was impersonating whom? I was threatened that horrifying secrets about me would be revealed. My parents were concerned for my safety, but I couldn’t bear it quietly. There was a group of jealous hats wandering around him (Hrithik), using him to aim vengeance at me.” Also read: Has Kangana Ranaut really AGREED to appear on Koffee With Karan with Saif Ali Khan? \nWell Kangana Ranaut never minces her words and she has proved it once again.
