Sounds familiar? The macho truck look made popular by the Ford F-150 Raptor was seen earlier on the Chevrolet Colorado High Country Storm , and is also employed by the truck you see here – the Nissan Navara Black Edition. \nAvailable on the King Cab Calibre 2.5 E 6MT, Double Cab Calibre 2.5 E 6MT and Double Cab Calibre 2.5 EL 7AT, the Black Edition adds on black projector head lamps, black fog lamp housing, a black grille, black wing mirror caps, black side steps, black 18-inch wheels, a black rear bumper, and black stickers on the roof and bonnet. No more chrome or silver, all in black. \nThe all-important garnishing is done via a black “dirt track” (this writer’s words, I don’t know what they’re actually called) motif that covers a large portion of the Navara’s sides, with a “Black Edition” sticker on the sides of the bed. Completing the rugged image are overfenders with silver bolts. The King Cab Black Edition adds on cruise control. \nNo mechanical changes, so the Black is powered by Nissan’s YD25DDTi 2.5 litre turbodiesel with 163 hp and 403 Nm of torque. The VGS engine is paired to either a six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic with manual mode. Prices range from 786,000 baht (RM100,831) to 918,000 baht (RM117,754), which is around 35,000 baht (RM4,489) costlier than the regular truck.
