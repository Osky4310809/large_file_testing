The terrigen ultimately meets its end thanks to the combined ingenuity of Moon Girl and Forge, though the decision to use it is put squarely in the hands of Medusa. Medusa ultimately decides to employ the measure, destroying the terrigen cloud in its entirety. \nWith mutant kind saved from extinction, Medusa, Black Bolt, and the rest of the Inhumans return to New Attilan. Instead of resuming her duties, though, Medusa decides to abdicate the throne, giving her ruling power to the Inhuman Iso. She even mentions that Iso has considered having free elections, and admits maybe the Inhumans aren't done with change after all. \nAlso worthy of note is that after the battle, Medusa sees the grief that Emma Frost went through with Cyclops. She decides to break things off wth the Human Torch, saying \"Goodbye Johnny, and thank you, thank you for all of it\". By issue's end, Medusa is seen having a drink with the Inhumans King, Blackbolt. It isn't implied they are getting back together, but it is an encouraging sign. \nYou can view the spoiler images in the gallery. \nInhumans Vs X-Men is written by Jeff Lemire and Charles Soule with art by Leinil Francis Yu. You can find the description below. \nThe war between the Inhumans and the X-Men takes a dark turn leaving Inhumans hopelessly outmatched. Emma Frost, the White Queen, faces off against Medusa, queen of the Inhumans, as both fight for the future of their people. It all ends here! \nInhumans Vs X-Men #6 is in stores today. \nMORE COMICS: Five Things We Learned From The Riverdale One-Shot / Another Marvel Character Punches Hitler / Ranking The Daredevil Costumes ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:12:50.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
