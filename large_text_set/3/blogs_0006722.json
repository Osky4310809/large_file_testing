Okay, maybe they should also be able to make some really good tea and have a comfortable reading chair that you could plonk yourself in, each time you visit. That's it, simple things. If you love reading books, we bet the benefits of a book loving BFF wouldn't have escaped your mind. Just to recap, here's how your book BFF makes your life super easy. So, go buy them that new book they've been lusting after. \n1. You have the two go-to libraries. Everything you don't have, your book-loving BFF does. So you save on space and also get to read loads. \n2. If you can't sleep at 4AM because your favourite book character just died, you know you can always call him/her. They'll totally get it, and although its 4AM they will definitely be up reading a book too. \n3. You have zero pressure to do fun things when you meet them. All you need is two good books, two cups of tea, and a comfortable spot around the house. \n4. You don't have to apologise to them for cancelling at the last minute, because you'd rather read. They totally get it. \n5. If you are holidaying with them, you don't need to apologise for not clicking selfies and reading a book instead. Losing yourselves to a book by the beach was the ideal plan anyway. \n6. You'll never run out of conversations. Everything - from new books, to old book characters to people who don't return books - you'll always have a lot to discuss. \n7. Speaking of people who don't return books, you will end up hating the same list of people who bookmark pages and, with their opinion in tow, you'll have a better list of \"People who should never get near your books.\" \n8. \"Let's go buy stuff for the bookshelf?\" You can finally text this to a real person without being judged. \n9. Every shopping trip you take will end up in a library... what more do you need. \n10. You finally have a friend whom you can lend books to without breaking your heart. Because they'd know how precious your babies are, and will take really good care of them.
