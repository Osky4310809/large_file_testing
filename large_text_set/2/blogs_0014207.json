According to The Hill , Chaffetz has stated that he has no intention of having his committee look into Flynn, and instead will leave it up to the House Intelligence Committee. \nChaffetz believes that Flynn stepping down has caused the situation to take care of itself, and that this investigation is more within the bounds of the Intelligence Committee anyway, seeing as how they are already looking into the Russian hacks. \n“It really is the purview of the Intel Committee. They really are the only ones that can look at that type of information, particularly when you’re talking about interactions with a nation-state like that. It’s not something the Oversight Committee can actually look at because sources and methods are the exclusive purview of the Intel Committee,” Chaffetz said. \nHowever, CNN’s Manu Raju has reported that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) will not be launching a separate investigation into Flynn, citing executive privilege as the reason. Rep. Devin Nunes says the Intelligence Committee won't look into discussions between Trump and Flynn, citing executive privilege \n— Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 14, 2017 \nAmong those in the GOP who also believe investigating Flynn to be a waste of time is Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky) who said that looking into Flynn would be “excessive,” and would “make no sense.” Rate this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:33:02.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
