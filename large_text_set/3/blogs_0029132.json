Senate PRIB/Albert Calvelo   A Regional Trial Court in Davao City on Monday issued a warrant of arrest against confessed hitman Edgar Matobato and one other for kidnapping an alleged terrorist in 2002. Panabo City RTC Branch 4 Judge Dorothy Gonzaga issued the warrant of arrest against Matobato and Sonny Custodio for the kidnapping and murder of alleged terrorist Sali Makdum in 2002. \"No bail bond is recommended for the provisional liberty of each accused in the above-entitled case,\" Gonzaga added. Marison Marquez, partner of Makdum, filed kidnapping charges against Matobato last January 19 at the Panabo City RTC. Testifying against President Rodrigo Duterte last December, Matobato told senators that the alleged Davao Death Squad, of which he claimed to be a member, kidnapped and killed Makdum on Samal Island, Davao in 2002. He said this was done on Mayor Duterte's orders. The Palace has denied allegations that there is any connection between Duterte and the Davao Death Squad.
