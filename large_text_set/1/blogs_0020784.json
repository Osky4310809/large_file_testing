No. 1 Villanova and No. 2 Kansas had already lost Tuesday night in what will cause a major shakeup of the rankings. Matt Norlander of CBS Sports described the crazy results across the country: Matt Norlander @MattNorlander Unusual, unpredictable and fun night for college basketball. The last time three of the top four teams lost on the same day was in 2012. 1/25/2017, 4:22:39 AM Robert Hubbs III was a difference-maker for Tennessee, finishing with 25 points and seven rebounds. Grant Williams also lit up the stat sheet with 13 points, six rebounds, six assists, four blocks and three steals, while Admiral Schofield added 15 points off the bench. The Volunteers went 5-of-10 from three-point range as well, making the only negative on the day the free-throw shooting. Dana O'Neill discussed the problem during the final stretch: Dana O'Neil @ESPNDanaOneil 1/25/2017, 4:18:24 AM Despite going 17-of-27 at the charity stripe, the team did enough to pull out the win. Kentucky saw a fantastic effort from Bam Adebayo, who ended his night with 21 points and two blocks on 7-of-8 shooting. The game also showed the positives and negatives of Malik Monk. He finished with 25 points but shot 7-of-19 including 3-of-13 from beyond the arc. He also had five turnovers in the loss. Pat Forde of Yahoo Sports summed up the effort: Pat Forde @YahooForde Malik Monk is gloriously good. He's also undisciplined at times, to echo the word Cal used for his team after the Louisville loss. Bad pass 1/25/2017, 3:56:22 AM Unfortunately, the team's overall struggles from the perimeter (6-of-24 from three-point range) and 14 turnovers helped lead to the upset. Kentucky came into the game as the favorite but Tennessee did not appear intimidated. After overcoming an early 8-2 hole, the two teams were neck-and-neck throughout much of the first half. Eventually, a 9-2 run toward the end of the half helped the Volunteers pull out a 39-34 lead at intermission. This big dunk by Hubbs, who had 15 at halftime, showed the confidence in the home team: Tennessee Basketball @Vol_Hoops 1/25/2017, 3:00:53 AM It took only a few minutes into the second half for this lead to balloon up to double digits as the Vols went up 50-40. As the game continued, Tennessee appeared to be clearly in charge as they not only held the lead but even extended it. Kyle Tucker of the Courier-Journal described the atmosphere: Kyle Tucker @KyleTucker_AJC This place is rocking. Vols bury a three and the lead is 11 with under 13 minutes to play. This feels very much like a Kentucky L. Of course, Kentucky was not going to go down without a fight. Adebayo had a number of big plays with the team taking advantage of the size inside.
