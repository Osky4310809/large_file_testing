Mansoor stabbed Palmer after getting out of the crashed vehicle and running towards Parliament. \n\"We would also like to express our gratitude to the people who were with Keith in his last moments and who were working that day. There was nothing more you could have done,\" Palmer's family said in a statement. \n\"You did your best and we are just grateful he was not alone,\" the family said. \"We care about him being remembered for his selfless bravery and loving nature. We miss him so much, but we are also incredibly proud of Keith.\" Wellwishers lay flowers outside the Houses of Parliament, following the March 22 attack by Khalid Masood, killing 4, and injuring 29, in London on March 25, 2017.

A 58-year-old man arrested in Birmingham was still in custody Saturday, police said. \n\"We are determined to understand if Masood was a lone actor inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him. If the latter proves to be the case, they will face justice,\" Basu said in a statement.
