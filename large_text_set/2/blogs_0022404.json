It will require some further time in terms of getting the details of the person who destroyed the CCTV. I’m confident that can be done.” \nRosie Cook, prosecuting, said the matter would be investigated and the case is due to call again on March 8. \nPark, who lives in Prestonfield, Edinburgh, is accused of giving a reading of 66 micrograms of alcohol in 100 ml of breath on October 8 last year. The limit is 22mg. \nShe was listed in court papers as Jane Restorick, her mum’s surname. \nEarlier this month, Park said she planned to sue because someone her age shouldn’t have been allowed to win such a huge sum. \nShe later said she’d spoken to a lawyer but would not be going ahead with legal action. \nShe added that she achieved her aim of raising awareness of the dangers of striking it rich so young. \nShe said: “I feel like I have been listened to now and people are actually listening to the difficulties.” \nIn 2015, we told how Park got a job in a chippy because she was “bored spending money” after scooping the jackpot.
