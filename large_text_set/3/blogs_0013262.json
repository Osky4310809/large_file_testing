This legislation provides significant new tools and options for our policy in the region and I’m pleased to join Senator Rubio in this effort.” \nToday, Reuters reported that “China has started fresh construction work in the disputed South China Sea, new satellite images show, a sign that Beijing is continuing to strengthen its military reach across the vital trade waterway.” \nThe South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act would: Require the president to impose sanctions and prohibit visas for Chinese individuals and entities who contribute to construction or development projects, and those who threaten the peace, security or stability of the South China Sea (SCS) or East China Sea (ECS); Impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions that knowingly conduct or facilitate a significant financial transaction for sanctioned individuals and entities if China takes certain actions in the SCS or ECS, including declaring an air defense identification zone or increasing activities at Scarborough Shoal; Mandate a report on individuals and entities involved in sanctionable activities, including some employees of certain Chinese companies; Prohibit the publication of documents portraying the SCS or the ECS as part of China, investments in the SCS or the ECS, and the recognition of the annexation of the SCS or the ECS; and Restrict foreign assistance to countries that recognize China’s sovereignty in the SCS or the ECS. \nRubio, currently the chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), introduced a version of the bill in December .
