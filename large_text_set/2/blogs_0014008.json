While the rest of us either made grand plans with our lovers, or brooded over our singlehood, Aradhaya had no chill for any such nonsense on the day of love. Why? Because she took her Dadaji , none other than Amitabh Bachchan, out for a V-Day dinner date. \nIn his blog, Sr. Bachchan narrated the incident. \n\"The granddaughter here at home, has most politely expressed a desire to eat a pizza at an Italian restaurant. Miss Aradhaya has quietly and in most dignified manner, sat at her table, spread the napkin across her legs, ordered the menu by drawing the attention of the waiter... giving instructions of just how crisp she wanted her pizza to be. And when it has arrives has most politely turned to the waitress, thanked her for the dish and then,'wish you a very Happy Valentine's Day' musically departs her tender lips. \nDeed over, she has desired her Dada ji to drive her back home, which he willingly does, and on getting home when other family ask her to thank me for taking he out, goes quiet and puts on a sulk... \nShe replies, 'I should not thank at all, all must thank me for it was I that suggested we must go out for dinner.' \nShe is 5... with an additional 0... 50!\" \nIndeed, all of five, Aradhaya seems to have the poise, elegance, and self-assurance of a lady, that many of us, well into our 20s and 30s are still working towards!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:49:01.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
