Pat Roberts (R-KS) responded, “I sure don’t want want my mammogram benefits taken away.”\nThe Senator was referring to a tired, predominantly Republican argument that men should not have to pay for services only used by women because they believe this drives up healthcare costs. Roberts soon backtracked and issued an apology after his comments received backlash on Twitter, most notably from Democratic congresswomen who didn’t think his comments were very funny.\n40,000 US women will die from breast cancer this year. But Republicans think taking away coverage for mammograms is funny. #TrumpCare https://t.co/249J5WdUKi \n— Rep.

Mammograms are essential to women's health & I never intended to indicate otherwise.\n— Pat Roberts (@SenPatRoberts) March 23, 2017 \n\nMammogram coverage is not part of the Essential Health Benefit under Obamacare, but rather mandated under a different section of Affordable Healthcare Act that requires insurance cover preventative care for women.\nMore than 2,400 men die of breast cancer each year. \n(via Talking Points Memo & Medical News Today )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:03:28.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
