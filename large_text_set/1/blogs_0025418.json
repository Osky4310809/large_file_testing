You and your spouse stay home and make full use of three hours of glorious privacy. \n\nCDN \nWe're not talking about leaving the kids with a sitter overnight, just three or four hours of hotel/motel bliss. This could be a little costly but look for hotel/motel deals and grab one. Even in a major city, you may be able to find a last-minute deal for a romantic interlude. \nHere's how to make the most of this date idea without further bank account damage. Take a picnic basket with chilled champagne, fruit, a cheese plate and some fancy chocolate. Bring some scented massage oil and use your imagination! \n\nGiphy \nFor a less expensive alternative of the previous date night idea, ask friends who are going out of town if you may use their home or apartment as your \"hotel room\" for the night. Bring your sheets and towels and leave a bottle of champagne as a thank you, along with an offer to return the favor when you're out of town. \n\nTumblr \nMake it a double date with the parents of your child's friend. If the kids are old enough for the sitter-to-child ratio to work, pool your resources and let the kids have a play date while the adults have a double date. \nYou get the enjoyment of remembering how much fun your spouse is when you see him or her interact with others outside of the rut that the two of you may have fallen into.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:53:08.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
