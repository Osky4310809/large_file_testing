Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDavid Beckham has been snapped up by the Chinese government - to help the country win the World Cup . \nThe former England skipper answered a plea from President Xi Jingping, who has vowed to win football’s biggest prize. \nBeckham and the Chinese leader became friends in 2012 after meeting at a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game. \nFootball-mad President Xi is hoping the ex-Manchester United star can inspire the next generation of Chinese footballers. \nBeckham will appear daily on Chinese state television introducing a series of coaching videos for youngsters.

It really is the best time to start. My advice to you is to take your time, build a solid foundation with basic skills. \n“If you practice every day you will get better. Best wishes to China’s future football stars.” \nThe Adidas-sponsored TV series is the brainchild of Tom Byer - an American regarded as a coaching guru in the Far East. David and Cruz Beckham (Photo: Instagram) \nHe was poached from rivals Japan by China’s Ministry of Education to revolutionise football in the country. \nMr Byer told the Mirror: “Only eight countries have won the World Cup. That’s because football is in their culture. \n“What the videos and other initiatives will hopefully do is educate families and children. We want them to start from the moment they can walk, teaching them to manipulate a football. \n“If you wait until children are six or seven and then give them a ball, it’s too late. China has a culture that school is for studying and that’s all that matters.

We need educate families that children involved in physical activity do better academically. \n“It is great that David has come onboard as he’s a huge name in China and will help inspire the kids.” \nPresident Xi is a lifelong Manchester United fan and met Gary Neville during an official tour to the UK in 2015. \nThe Chinese leader has an array of signed football shirts from stars including Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
