By: Manika Gupta | Published: February 24, 2017 2:28 PM This kind of violence has ramifications that the US media should not keep quiet about if it is free and fair in the true sense. (IE) \nKansas shooting: An Indian techie becoming a victim of `hate violence does not make a story for the US media! Why? This kind of violence has ramifications that the US media should not keep quiet about if it is free and fair in the true sense. Or should we think that it has become part of the Donald Trump anti-immigrant campaign? \nWhether it is Fox News, NBC News, CNN or ABC, none of them have even a mention of this hate violence. Even in the past, they have tried to ‘block’ \nsuch stories. It is not that they don’t carry localised news — Fox News right now is carrying a story on “stray bullet bouncing off a ‘woman’s head’. \nNBC-local section has a channel on Kansas, but there is not even a mention of the hate violence against the Indian techie. Is the media also discriminatory or racist? \nThe shooting of 32-year engineer, in which Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed and two others injured when an American man opened fire on them after allegedly yelling “get out of my country” clearly shows that hate violence is increasing. This violence against immigrants or those on HI B visa will only increase with President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration policies encouraging hate violence. \nWatch this also: \nEven the local police has agreed tha it was “possible hate crime”. This incidence is creating more insecurity amongst the immigrants and it is the duty of free press in the United States of America to highlight incidents such as this. Why is the US media so quiet? Are they blocking it or are they apathetic to a concern that is so important to the immigrant community. And the immigrant community is large in the United States. Let’s not forget that it is a country of immigrants. Media which is free and fair should seriously take up the case of hate violence so that it is not perpetuated further especially in the context of Donald Trump’s policies . \nWhile the US media might say that shootings are becoming common in the US, the hate violence is very prejudicial to the peace and harmony of the country. A country where Indians contribute so much to the economy, it is very important to report and create public opinion against it. US media is better off being fair and free and not branded as racist.
