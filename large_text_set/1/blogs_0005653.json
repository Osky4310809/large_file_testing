Lacy Clay. Clay had this to say about the work of \"art\":\nIn his remarks to the overflow crowd of young artists, parents and teachers who gathered at Webster University’s new downtown St. Louis campus in the historic Arcade Building, Congressman Clay said, “Tonight, we are celebrating our sixteenth year of recognizing outstanding young artistic talent. As you can see from the artwork on display here, the level of talent is truly impressive. Your work is inspiring, and I encourage all of you to continue to develop your creative abilities.”\nLeave it to a Marine veteran to take matters into his own hands.\nOffended by the thinly veiled insult to police, Rep. Duncan Hunter unscrewed the painting from the wall and took it down, bring it to Rep. Clay's office.\nFox News:\n“I was angry,” Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., told FoxNews.com. “I’ve seen the press [reporting] on this for about a week or so. … I’m in the Marine Corps. If you want it done, just call us.”\nHunter said he walked over to the artwork Friday morning with a few colleagues and unscrewed it. He then delivered it to the office of Rep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo., the congressman whose office had allowed the piece to be displayed. The painting, hanging since June, was done by a high school student who had won Clay’s annual Congressional Art competition.\nThe piece drew outrage, however, from law enforcement groups and fellow lawmakers.\nAs for whether the painting will stay down, Hunter said: “Lacy can put it back up, I guess, if he wants to … but I’m allowed to take it down.”\nClay’s office has not yet responded to a request from FoxNews.com for comment.\nMore than 27,000 law enforcement professionals had been protesting the display of what they called a “reprehensible, repugnant and repulsive” painting in the hallway of the Capitol.\nAfter being told the piece was removed, Ron Hernandez, president of the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, said in a statement Friday they were “very pleased.”\nHe said: “At a time of our country facing rising crime and a shortage of those willing to work the streets as police officers and deputy sheriffs, we need to make it clear that depictions of law enforcement officers as pigs in our Nation's Capital is not acceptable.”\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/06/rep-duncan-hunter-removes-painting-in-capitol-depicting-a-cop-as-a-pig/\nload more View as single page", "external_links": ["http://ijr.com/2016/12/766256-painting-of-cops-as-pigs-hung-proudly-in-u-s-capitol/", "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/06/gop-congressman-takes-down-colleagues-sponsored-art-depicting-police-as-pigs.html"], "published": "2017-01-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:23:43.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
