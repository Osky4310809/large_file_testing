College are looking for good athletes, but that is easy to find. What they are also looking for is good people and good students. You can't find all three of those, everywhere you go.\" \nCarson made sure to take a moment to acknowledge everyone that played a part in getting the athletes to this step in their athletic careers - urging the students to thank them. \n\"To get to this [point] has taken a lot of people: parents and grandparents that have hauled them out to lessons, meets, tournaments, practice, and school,\" Carson said. \"We also have great coaches that have-not only coached-but mentored and molded [these students]. We've also had great teachers and counselors that have helped in this journey.\" \nGavin Salton will continue his tennis career at the University of Montevallo . Tennis coach Robert Klein , who is in his third semester at College Park, says he feels cheated that he didn't get to coach Salton longer. \n\"I'm very happy for him, his family, friends and for Montevallo College ,\" Klein said. \"They are going to get a very quick and fast player. It is amazing to see him develop over the last year.\" \nCollege Park girls soccer had two athletes sign Wednesday morning. Abby McDowell will play for the University of Texas at Dallas next year and Isa Sanabria will play for Abilene Christian University . \nGirls soccer coach Meredith Cook , in her fifth season at College Park, has coached McDowell for the past two season. \n\"From the minute that I met Abby I knew she was special,\" Cook said. \"She became a starter the minute she walked in the door. She is a center mid and is great at holding the ball, and is a great distributor. I was very excited when she said she wanted to look at UT Dallas-they have no idea, what a fantastic player they are getting.\" \nSanabria has been one of the more dynamic players for the Lady Cavaliers, during Cook's tenure. Sanabria is a four-year letterman, was named district Newcomer of the year as a freshman and has been a first team all-district selection every year since. \n\"When she decided that's where she wanted to go I knew [ACU] would be very excited,\" Cook said. \"She is going to be able to step in and be an impact player right away. She is an amazing, phenomenal young lady and player-she is going to be a fabulous player for ACU.\" \nCarson had two athletes signing NLIs on Wednesday; Josh Mrazek signed with Dordt College and Jordan Turnquest signed with Colorado School of Mines . \nMrazek, played linebacker for College Park and was among the team leaders in tackles according to Carson. \n\"Better than a football player, he is a fine young man,\" Carson said. \"He wasn't always the biggest, strongest or fastest guy but he found a way. When he was a freshman he came to me and said, 'coach, I want to do this. What do I need to do to make this happen?' He did those things, always worked and was one of the most coachable guys I have worked with.\" \nTurnquest was the Cavaliers starting quarterback for the past two seasons, but he and coach Carson go farther back than that. \n\"When he was four or five years old, he was in my wife's Sunday school class,\" Carson said. \"And I was like, 'who is that uncoordinated boy tripping over those blocks?' Little did I know-I started coaching him right then, 'hey, you got to get your knees up.' He is a hard worker and a great student. There is a lot of pressure in Texas being the quarterback. He handled that pressure and did a great job leading our football team.\" \nVolleyball coach Candice Gibson wrapped up the ceremony as she spoke about Linzy Woods , who will continue her career at Grambling State University . \n\"Linzy is one of the most dynamic and spirited people that you will ever meet,\" Gibson said. \"She has this fire that could just turn or team on. There were nights I would tell her, 'the only thing I need you to do is get fired up.' To see her come from where she was her freshman year to her senior year is an incredible thing. I am super excited for her to go to Grambling. I think it is an amazing fit and I'm incredibly excited for her future.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:12:10.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
