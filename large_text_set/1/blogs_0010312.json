Since its launch, the iPhone has gone on to sell over a billion units and has been the key inspiration behind products like the iPad and Apple Watch. \nThe press release also contains a quote from Apple’s current CEO Tim Cook in which he says that the iPhone has redefined the way people “communicate, entertain, work, and live.” He also says the best for the iPhone is yet to come. \n“iPhone is an essential part of our customers’ lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come.” \nPhilip Schiller, SVP of Marketing, says that the iPhone has been the gold standard by which other smartphones are compared. \n“It is amazing that from the very first iPhone through to today’s newest iPhone 7 Plus, it has remained the gold standard by which all other smartphones are judged. For many of us, iPhone has become the most essential device in our lives and we love it,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “iPhone is how we make voice and FaceTime calls, how we shoot and share Live Photos and 4K videos, how we listen to streaming music, how we use social media, how we play games, how we get directions and find new places, how we pay for things, how we surf the web, do email, manage our contacts and calendars, how we listen to podcasts, watch TV, movies and sports, and how we manage our fitness and health. iPhone has become all of these things and more. And I believe we are just getting started.” \nApple then proceeds to highlight some of the innovations on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, including the dual-camera system on the latter, the A10 Fusion chip, Stereo speakers, and the reengineered body for IP67 certification. \nWhile Apple had announced the original iPhone on January 9th, the device went on sale six months later on June 29th, 2007. The phone met with a tremendous response with thousands of people queuing up outside Apple and AT&T’s store in the United States days before the handset even went on sale. \nDid you buy the original iPhone?
