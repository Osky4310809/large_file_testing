Owner Anne Owen announced over the long weekend she has closed the juicery that opened in 2014 to focus on wholesale research and development. The “modern juice apothecary” may have been too niche—even for the ahead-of-the-curve residents of the hip neighborhood. \nDear friends, we have decided to close our Logan Square store indefinitely in order to focus on wholesale R&D and the... Posted by Owen + Alchemy on Saturday, January 14, 2017 Owen + Alchemy had been closed during December, and the juice bar has popped up in places including Eataly and the now-shuttered Elú boutique in Lincoln Park. O + A had plans for locations in West Town and West Loop , as well as an Uptown location , but there hasn’t been an update on any of them. Owen teamed up with chef Jared Van Camp’s Element Collective on the juice bar, who exited his partnership in it in October . Owen said O + A split away from Element Collective—the group that runs Old Town Social in Old Town, Leghorn Chickens in Ukrainian Village and River North, as well as Nellcote and RM Champagne in West Loop—back in May 2015. Owen wouldn’t comment any further, citing a need to clarify what she could say with her attorney. Critics have said Owen + Alchemy’s cold-pressed juices and cleanse packages are often pricey. Many Logan Square restaurant owners have struggled with finding the right prices for their food, and Owen + Alchemy may have faced the same challenges. UPDATE: Owen added a bit more via email, writing how she loved Logan Square and the neighborhood’s businesses. She reiterates they’re focusing more on wholesale. Over the last few years, Owen said she’s received wholesale partnership inquiries and she’s looking forward to exploring those opportunities: “We are proud of the brand we built and the incredibly loyal following. We hope to be able to share more updates soon.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T07:15:24.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
