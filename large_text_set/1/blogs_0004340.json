The RunIQ is a rare exception to the story, the fruits of a long ago announced partnership between Intel and running shoe maker, New Balance . \nThe company has teamed up with a number of other big tech names for the wearable device – because that’s what you do when you’re a shoemaker launching your first smartwatch. \nAt first glance, the RunIQ looks to be standard fitness smartwatch fare, big names aside. You’ve got a heart rate monitor, GPS and a battery that should give you a fairly middling 24 hours of life on a charge. There are also a few physical running watch buttons built in, for things like laps, making it a somewhat interesting marriage of smartwatch and running watch. The watch is also waterproof, naturally. \nThe Google partnership brings offline Google Music access, so users can go for a run without bringing their smartphone along, while Strava has integrated its social network of runners directly into the product. \nNew Balance is also using the occasion to announce a pair of Bluetooth headphones, the similarly named PaceIQ, which were created in partnership with Jabra. You’ll be able to pick up both devices at retail February 1, running $300 and $110, respectively. Assuming, of course, you aren’t still harboring strong negative feelings about the shoe company… Latest from CES 2017 More CES 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:04:34.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
