Eduard Mikhailov, Deputy Commander of Flotilla of Pacific Fleet of Russia, during arrival honors as he visits the Russian anti-submarine Navy vessel Admiral Tributs in Manila, Philippines on Friday, Jan. 6, 2017. Duterte toured one of two Russian warships docked at Manila's port in another gesture of warming ties with Moscow. AP/Aaron Favila \n  President Rodrigo Duterte issued Executive Order 12 which implements Republic Act 10354 or the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012. \nThe Reproductive Health (RH) Law has not been implemented due to a temporary restraining order issued by the Supreme Court. \nRELATED: SC urged: Lift TRO on RH law \nThe strengthening of the RH Law implementation is part of the Duterte administration's 10-point socio-economic agenda to \"enable poor couples to make informed choices on financial and family planning.\" \nData from the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that at least six million women, of which two million are poor, have unmet need for any modern method of contraception. \n\"This Order aims to intensify and accelerate the implementation of critical actions necessary and sustain 'zero unmet need for modern family planning' for all poor households by 2018, and all of Filipinos thereafter, within the context of the [RH] Law and its implementing rules,\" the order read.   \nThe president ordered the Department of Health, Commission on Population, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and other relevant government agencies to collaborate with all local government units (LGUs) for the implementation of the RH Law. \nThe executive order directed the Department of Education to implement a \"gender-sensitive\" and \"rights-based\" comprehensive sexuality education in the school curriculum. \nThe Department of Social Welfare and Development was ordered to integrate RH Law strategies in the national poverty reduction and social protection programs. \nThe DILG was tasked to monitor compliance of LGUs with the implementation of the RH Law. \nDuterte signed EO 12 on Monday through Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea. The order will take effect immediately. \nThe order came amid the Supreme Court's temporary restraining order on contraceptive implants, a contraceptive that can prevent pregnancies for up to three years.
