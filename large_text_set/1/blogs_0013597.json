But it appears that the developer — LG Realty — will be taking the commission to court — saying it had paid to relocate residents and would contribute half any tax breaks to an affordable housing fund. \n“Well we’re going to evaluate our options. We believe we comply with the criteria as set out in the ordnance. We comply with the criteria of the code. And believe we’re entitled to approval,” said LG Realty lawyer Jonathan Kamin. \nMeanwhile, Oharold Hoots, one of three dozen residents still living in the plaza, can’t find alternative housing. He said the $700 he pays in rent each month isn’t enough to get another place in the neighborhood. \n“Well we’re stilling here and we don’t have anywhere to go. We’ve been to every entity trying to find affordable housing and nobody will take us. Honest to God,” Hoots said. \nIt’s become ground zero in the fight over gentrification — pitting the interests of developers against those in the community who say this new Pittsburgh should include everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T03:18:11.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
