Apparently, not everyone read that book, so now we have a sequel.\nBlack Lives Matter activist Muhiyidin d'Baha was arrested on Wednesday in South Carolina after epically leaping over a police tape barricade to snatch a Confederate flag out of a protestor's hand.\nSince it took place directly behind a CBS newscast, the stunning moment aired on live TV — the cameraman followed d'Baha as he quickly ran across the shot. \nSEE ALSO: How Black Lives Matter made the leap from social media to social action \nCheck out the unbelievable moment here.\nProtester jumps barricade and attempts to get Confederate flag from man #chsnews pic.twitter.com/hTBql8qS9Z \n— Ray Rivera (@RayRiveraLive5) February 22, 2017 \nThe flag was held by a member of the South Carolina Secessionist Party, protesting outside of the College of Charleston's Sottile Theatre, at an event featuring Newsome , an African-American activist, filmmaker and one of the driving forces behind the South Carolina state government's decision to permanently remove the Confederate flag from Capitol grounds.\nD'Baha was counter-protesting the demonstration when he dove over the police tape, and is now being lauded on Twitter for his remarkable act of resistance.\nThis is Muhiyidin d’Baha, a #blacklivesmatter organizer and, like Bree Newsome, a #RoleModel and #hero . Conviction and courage in action. https://t.co/UgZ3ZVfWs5 \n— Donald Deeley (@DonaldJDeeley) February 23, 2017 \n@RayRiveraLive5 Somebody give that young man a medal. He's definitely doing great work.\n— JL Sigman (@JLSigman) February 23, 2017 \nThat's the shit right there. No place for the confederate flag to be used like that in the US nowadays.
