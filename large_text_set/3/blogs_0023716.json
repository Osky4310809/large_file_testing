Prior to the Uttar Pradesh election, ‘informed’ opinion, both domestic and internal, had veered to the view that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to enter the more difficult part of his present five-year tenure. It was believed that the next two years would be bereft of sure-footedness and that radically disruptive moves such as the surgical strike on terror bases in Pakistan and demonetisation would be a thing of the past. After the results, the chatter centres on the inevitability of another Modi victory in 2019 and even more audacious attempts to change the face of India. While some feel that Modi will nudge India towards a more explicitly Hindu polity, others believe the principal focus will still be on bread-and-butter issues.\nAnticipating the future course of politics is always daunting and requires constant fine-tuning. While Modi is still the clear favourite to win the 2019 general election, there is nothing inevitable about it. Two years is a very long time in politics and the future, as Harold Macmillan said, depends on ‘events’ and more events. The electoral question is best left for a time nearer the event.\nThere are, however, important consequences of the resounding BJP win in UP. For Modi baiters, it is the choice of Yogi Adityanath to be the chief minister in Lucknow that has set the ball rolling. The alarm over an overbearing Hindutva political direction may well turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Yet, it is important to keep in mind the fact that the Yogi wasn’t chosen because Modi has a distaste for tunday kebab and all that it symbolises, but because the leadership felt that the challenges in UP could best be met by someone with a popular base and an emotional connect with the party’s base. The two priorities set out for the Yogi are to get a grip on law and order and weed out corruption as much as possible. In short, it is to create an environment where productive forces can come into play.\nFor Modi, being insufficiently understood has been an unending occupational hazard, and this has little to do with his fraught relationship with the media. There has been a widespread tendency to dissect his administration through a doctrinaire prism. Thus, a section of the Left still views him as a facilitator of India’s crony big business. The free-market lot sees his record as one of betrayal, and are miffed by his attempts to build state capacity. And many opposition parties see him as a handmaiden of the RSS, fulfilling an agenda that moves India towards cultural Hindu hegemony. Modi, on his part, has preferred to not directly contest these contradictory narratives, believing — perhaps rightly — that it is better to leave critics shooting in different directions and simply get on with the job.\nThe undeniable political strengthening of Modi after the UP verdict is unlikely to foster a uniform understanding of the man and his government. At the same time, however, there is certain to be a big shift in Modi’s relationship with India’s institutions and the perception overseas.\nDespite his clear victory in May 2014 and his undisputed leadership, Modi confronted roadblocks in his path. First, there was uncertainty over whether Modi was there to manage the country or change it. The establishment — that nebulous category which is so real and yet so hard to define — hoped it was the former. Various pillars of the state, not least the bureaucracy, preferred India to be given a new coat of paint rather than undergo a redesign. Always wary of strong political leadership, the establishment — in which the BJP dispensation is a minuscule component — preferred plodding change. The abhorrence of sharp ruptures was also accorded a civilisational attribute — the we-are-like-that-only school of do-nothing.\nIn his first three years in Delhi, Modi confronted subtle but quite insidious resistance from the establishment. This is true both in internal affairs and foreign policy. Post-UP, this resistance is likely to wane significantly. The feeling that Modi is there for the foreseeable future is now widespread both at home and abroad.\nModi proclaimed his intention to press on the accelerator in his ‘New India’ speech on March 12. Now he needs to identify his priorities succinctly and choose a team that shares his motivation and desire to move forward relentlessly. He also needs to build a counter-establishment to get the narrative right. His governance must match his philosophy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:10:21.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
