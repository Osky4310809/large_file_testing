Fredrick Lemons says investigators are looking at surveillance camera footage to help determine who pushed over the headstones.\nAccording to its website, the cemetery opened in 1893.\nMissouri Gov. Eric Greitens posted a statement on Facebook late Monday night calling the vandalism “despicable” and “a cowardly act.”\nGreitens says “anyone who would seek to divide us through an act of desecration will find instead that they unite us in shared determination.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:38:37.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
