Since the election, the political novice has been one of the transition team's main liaisons to foreign governments, communicating with Israeli officials and meeting Sunday with Britain's foreign minister. He's also huddled with congressional leaders and helped interview Cabinet candidates.\nIvanka Trump, who also played a significant role advising her father during the presidential campaign, will not be taking a formal White House position. Transition officials said the mother of three young children wanted to focus on moving her family from New York to Washington, though a person with knowledge of the decision said her business, a clothing line and lifestyle brand, was complicating her move into government.\nKushner's own eligibility for the White House could be challenged, given a 1967 law meant to bar government officials from hiring relatives. Kushner lawyer Jamie Gorelick argued Monday that the law does not apply to the West Wing. She cited a later congressional measure to allow the president \"unfettered\" and \"sweeping\" authority in hiring staff.\nIn a statement, Trump said Kushner will be an \"invaluable member of my team as I set and execute an ambitious agenda.\"\nKushner will resign as CEO of his family's real estate company and as publisher of the New York Observer. He will also divest \"substantial assets,\" Gorelick said. The lawyer said Kushner would not be taking a salary. Ivanka Trump will also be leaving her executive roles at the Trump Organization — her father's real estate company — and her own fashion brands.\nWhy Donald Trump's selection of his son-in-law for a top White House job is a dicey decision Aaron Blake Donald Trump 's son-in-law, Jared Kushner , will serve as a senior adviser to the Trump White House , The Washington Post's John Wagner and Ashley Parker have confirmed.\nThe news isn't surprising, given Kushner's closeness to Trump and the fact that his potential role in the administration has been...\nDonald Trump 's son-in-law, Jared Kushner , will serve as a senior adviser to the Trump White House , The Washington Post's John Wagner and Ashley Parker have confirmed.\nThe news isn't surprising, given Kushner's closeness to Trump and the fact that his potential role in the administration has been...\n(Aaron Blake) Kushner, who turns 36 on Tuesday, emerged as one of Trump's most powerful campaign advisers during his father-in-law's often unorthodox presidential bid — a calming presence in an otherwise chaotic campaign. Soft-spoken and press-shy, he was deeply involved in the campaign's digital efforts and was usually at Trump's side during the election's closing weeks.\nHe has continued to be a commanding presence during the transition, working alongside incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Steve Bannon. He's played a key role in coordinating Trump's contacts with foreign leaders and has been talking with foreign government officials himself, according to a person with knowledge of the conversations.\nTrump confidants could face tangle of potential conflicts as presidential advisers John Wagner, Ylan Q.

But Icahn also stands to benefit if his advice is taken: It could make the energy companies and others in which he has a stake more profitable.\nTrump's daughter...\nBillionaire investor Carl Icahn will have the ear of President-elect Donald Trump as an adviser focused on cutting government regulations. But Icahn also stands to benefit if his advice is taken: It could make the energy companies and others in which he has a stake more profitable.\nTrump's daughter...\n(John Wagner, Ylan Q. Mui) Last week, Kushner and Bannon — the controversial conservative media executive — met with British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.\nKushner and Bannon have also worked closely on issues related to Israel, including discussions over moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, which could inflame tensions in the Middle East, and on the Trump administration's response to a United Nations Security Council measure condemning Israeli settlements.\nKushner is also weighing in on domestic policy. He joined other Trump advisers Monday night for a meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on tax reform. He championed the pick of his friend Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, for a top White House economic post, and Cohn's influence within Trump's team is said to be growing.\nThose with knowledge of Kushner's role spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal matters.\nThe anti-nepotism law had appeared to be the main obstacle to Kushner joining the White House. In arguing that the measure did not apply to the West Wing, Gorelick cited an opinion from two federal court judges in a 1993 case involving Hillary Clinton 's work on her husband's health care law. She said Trump planned to seek an advisory opinion on the nepotism law from the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel.\nGorelick worked in the Clinton administration at both the Pentagon and Justice Department.\nNorman Eisen, who served as President Barack Obama 's government ethics lawyer, said there is a \"murky legal landscape\" regarding the anti-nepotism law. But he said Kushner appeared to be taking the proper steps regarding the ethics and disclosure requirements for federal employees.\nLike his father-in-law, Kushner pushed a mid-sized real estate company into the high-stakes battlefield of Manhattan. Though he is often viewed as more moderate than Trump, people close to him say he fully bought into the Trump campaign's fiery populist message that resonated with white, working-class voters. He never publicly distanced himself from Trump's more provocative stances, including the candidate's call for a Muslim-immigration ban and his doubts about President Barack Obama's birthplace.\nKushner's place in Trump's orbit — vital but often discreet — was vividly on display last month, when the president-elect toured the Carrier plant in Indiana to tout the jobs he says he saved.\nTrump marched around the plant with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, shaking hands with workers, posing for photos and flashing his thumbs-up to the traveling press. Kushner stayed away from the cameras, lingering a deferential 10 or 20 feet from Trump while marveling at the scene.\n\"Look at these people,\" Kushner was overheard saying as he watched dozens of workers cheer. \"This is why he won.\"\nAssociated Press\n Britain Israel Donald Trump White House Jared Kushner Hillary Clinton Barack Obama", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5872adc8/turbine/ct-trump-presidential-advisers-20170108", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5873dc75/turbine/ct-jared-kushner-trump-20170109", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5873fdb4/turbine/ct-kushner-trump-analysis-20170109"], "published": "2017-01-10T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:38:14.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
