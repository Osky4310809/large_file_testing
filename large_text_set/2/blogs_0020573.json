A cherry tomato \"because they are gorgeous to look at, versatile in cooking, easy to consume and loved by all!\" (Trudy) A cauliflower because \"it's rustic yet elegant, transformative when given the right time and experimentation, colorful, and has pockets full of surprises!\" (Kristy Gardner) Mushrooms foraged in the woods —\"meaty, savory, and adaptable.\" (Alison Dunn) A carrot \"because it is so versatile you can use it in almost every aspect of life. And everyone needs carrots in their life. It’s the beginning of many beautiful recipes, the perfect accompaniment to any meal and perfect just on its own—just like many of the recipes in this cookbook.\" (Diana Leblanc) A potato \"because it is a root vegetable that symbolizes fundamentals and beginnings.\" (Valerie Lugonja) Corn \"because it is SW T!!\" (Kim Susands) An artichoke \"because it's got so many layers and a fabulous heart!\" (Mary Ann) Photo by Bobbi Lin “ The colors on the cover are so inviting, and I really like the way the sections are divided with an illustration of what's to come. ” —Tara Lee The book's organization \nHere's Teresa: \n\" The recipes are divided into sections based on ingredients, rather than preservation method. This approach embraces traditional practices (when strawberries are in season, bring home a flat, and make the most of them), while updating techniques and flavor combinations. Pickled beets are a staple of old cookbooks, but here the beets are charred to add a more complex flavor. Cherries are a favorite for canning, but Joel and Dana pickle them or dehydrate and grind them with espresso. Then, they take these preserves and work them into recipes that will ensure that your pantry shelves will empty as quickly as they fill.\" \nAnd while this book was published in Canada, Alison mentioned it does include common North American measurements, as well as weights and metric equivalents. the recipes \nReaders found any of the infusions , Frozen Herb Butter , and Fermented Asparagus Pickles to be good first recipes to make because they're great, but also gateways to preserving. Trudy said the beauty of the book is the no-scraps ethos, so \"the next time you have an ingredient you're working with refer, to Batch, to check for ways to preserve or cook with the parts of the ingredient you would normally throw away (such as the tops of strawberries, the brine from your hot peppers ... the list goes on). You'll be amazed by this 'nose to tail' approach to cooking with fresh ingredients!\" \nAs for favorite recipes, standouts included the Blueberry Maple Jam (\"Slather it on waffles, serve it on a cheese plate or as a sophisticated sauce accompanying game meats. Add a dash of brandy and drizzle it over a dense chocolate cake.\"); Pickled Baked Falafel Wraps ; Potato, Leek and Bacon Soup ; Chili-Infused Vodka (\"you make a jar of extra-hot vodka to use for a Bloody Mary or a pasta sauce, and you can always dilute the spicy vodka with . . . more vodka!\"); French Onion Soup with Pear Brandy ; and Herbes Salées (\"it's the ingredient you didn't know was missing from your refrigerator, it keeps for months, and it will help you with your resolution never to waste fresh herbs again\"). \nAlison Dunn picked the Roasted Rhubarb Jam , especially because of its \"Batch-It\" accompaniments: \n\"Each section includes Batch-It recipes, which means while I have the equipment and ingredients out for jam, now I have several other quick recipes to make while the water boils. In this case, dehydrated rhubarb maple \"candies\" and rhubarb salt for a delicious change on a cocktail rim.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:40:49.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
