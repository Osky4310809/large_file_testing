Secretary of State Rex Tillerson didn’t help matters by deciding to skip his first NATO meeting in April while still keeping his Russia trip on the schedule. One person in particular seems fed up with this chain of events, and that would be former Vice President Joe Biden.\nIn the above video, which was captured by Newsday ‘s Emily Ngo, Biden is seen criticizing Tillerson’s NATO slight to a pool of reporters on Wednesday. Biden was on hand to lead a D.C. rally (you can see that video below) with other Democrats to drum up support for Obamacare , since the House will vote on Thursday whether to repeal and replace. Biden seems miffed at Tillerson’s decision, and, in typical Joe fashion, he didn’t hold anything back :\n“The notion that there’s still this romance with Putin … I’m told [Tillerson] has decided he’s going to go visit Putin before he goes to the NATO conference? What in the hell are we doing?”\nIn Tillerson’s defense (not really), he didn’t really want the job of secretary of state. When later asked about Trump’s unfounded claims that Obama was wiretapping him, Biden scoffed at the notion, with NBC News’ Frank Thorp tweeting how Biden unloaded on Trump.\nAsked VP Biden if his admin wiretapped Trump Tower.\nBiden: \"Five or six times. Are you joking? Are you serious?\"\n— Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) March 22, 2017 \nBiden appeared to be at the point where he had been holding back criticism of Trump, and just needed to get some stuff off his chest.\n— Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) March 22, 2017 \nBiden: \"I really mean this sincerely, I hope the president decides that his campaign's gotta end and he has to start to govern.\"\n— Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) March 22, 2017 \n\n\nBiden on Trump:\"When the most powerful, most respected nation in the world is sounding a very uncertain trumpet it really has repercussions\"\n— Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) March 22, 2017 \nBiden says he and Obama were giving Pres Trump an opportunity to \"get his sea legs and you know, give him a chance.\" (1/2)\n— Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) March 22, 2017 \nBut Biden says \"It's getting down to the wire here in terms of whether or not he's really going to take charge\" (2/2)\n— Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) March 22, 2017 \n\nIn times of political uncertainty, the country can count on Joe Biden to cut through the malarkey. You can watch Biden’s rally comments on Obamacare (and the opioid epidemic) below.\n\n(Via The Hill )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:22:46.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
