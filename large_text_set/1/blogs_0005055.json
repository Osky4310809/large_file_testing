Still, the hashtag began trending after apparently being kickstarted by alt-right figure Mike Cernovich . If Trump must ‚Äúdisavow‚Äù every random Internet troll, then #BlackLivesMatter must disavow every crime or else they support it. #BLMKidnapping \n‚Äî Mike Cernovich üá∫üá∏ (@Cernovich) January 5, 2017 \nOthers on the right and alt-right soon followed, racking up thousands of retweets. Chicago hate crime law. This is clearly a hate crime. Why have Chicago police refused to label it that? #BLMKidnapping pic.twitter.com/1sCB580JW5 \n‚Äî Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) January 5, 2017 #BLMKidnapping was an opportunity for the left‚Äôs redemption. Reporters just needed to tell the truth. Instead, they sealed their casket. \n‚Äî Steven Crowder (@scrowder) January 5, 2017 The silence from the usual progressive race-baiting outlets over #BLMkidnapping is deafening. \n‚Äî Sargon of Akkad (@Sargon_of_Akkad) January 5, 2017 The Truth about the #BLMKidnapping you won‚Äôt see on the mainstream media: https://t.co/KMKI2zqm4V \n‚Äî Mark Dice (@MarkDice) January 5, 2017 Remember the #blmkidnapping every time some journalist lies about my white advocacy organization and calls it a hate group. \n‚Äî Richard üê∏ Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) January 5, 2017 I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs more disgusting, the video itself or the silence from the social justice warrior leftist media #BLMKidnapping \n‚Äî Deplorable Melissa (@sweetatertot2) January 5, 2017 Who in the name of hell raised the #BLMkidnapping goons? \n‚Äî Adam Baldwin (@AdamBaldwin) January 5, 2017 \nSome like Glenn Beck also blamed the movement without using the hashtag. Others hijacked the hashtag to challenge its premise. All of the white people in the #BLMKidnapping tag aren‚Äôt nearly as concerned about the white boy as they are with demonizing black people. \n‚Äî busan babe‚Ñ¢ (@melaninbarbie) January 5, 2017 Was it a hate crime?
