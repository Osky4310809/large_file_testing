HMMMM KATY PERRY LOOKS A LOT LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT does anyone else see it?!?!??!?! #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/Dr2dAMRe9d \n— Katie Corvino (@kTc0rvin0) February 13, 2017 \nDressed like a woman being eaten alive by a massive space worm, Katy sashayed down the carpet Sunday evening with the same hairstyle as her celebrity nemesis. REX/Shutterstock \nTaylor Swift didn’t release an album in 2016, meaning she’s not nominated and, therefore, not attending this year’s Grammy Awards. \nDue to her absence, it is yet unclear whether Katy Perry had her hair cut and dyed in a similar fashion, or personally scalped her red carpet enemy and wore her actual hair to the ceremony. REX/Shutterstock \nThe pop pair’s feud is no mystery to fans. Sure, Andy Cohen slipped up at last year’s Met Gala, but otherwise we’re pretty on top of it. REX/Shutterstock \nIn his memoir, “Superficial: More Adventures from the Andy Cohen Diaries,” the “Watch What Happens Live” host recalled the moment he saw Taylor scanning the room for a seat and suggested she pop a squat next to Katy. \nHe wrote, \nI innocently said exactly the wrong thing to her, which was: ‘Your friend Katy is sitting in the corner and there’s plenty of room around her’ … She asked, ‘Katy who?’ and I said, ‘Perry,’ at which point she clearly let me know that she’s the exact opposite of her friend. \nApparently, Taylor then advised Andy “not to say a word about this on [his] show.” Giphy \nThe host added, \nThat made me feel good momentarily good until I realized there might’ve been a ‘fucking’ thrown in there before ‘your show,’ or was that my scared imagination? (If she’s watching my ‘fucking’ show, that makes it a little less exciting.)… I sputtered that I had no plans to say a word about it on my show… She didn’t threaten me about putting it in my book… so here we are. \nLoopholes. Gotta love ’em. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
