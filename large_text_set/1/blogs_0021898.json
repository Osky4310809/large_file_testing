Then I came across Adam’s picture, I knew I had to reach out to him hoping that he would return the message. I was so excited when I found out that I had a message in my inbox from him. \nWe exchanged many messages back and forth for a week straight before we ever met. We put everything out on the table in the messages. Me having a son and him having a prior failed engagement. \nAfter all of the back and forth messages and phone calls we decided to finally meet. It was the best decision that we could have made. \nTwo years later we were engaged and then married in October 2016. We are now ready to start this journey that is ahead of us!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:02:50.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
