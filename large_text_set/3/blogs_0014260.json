That’s on top of an eight-per-cent cut that took effect Jan. 1, when they removed the provincial sales tax on hydro. \nDavid Gough/Postmedia Network Horrobin said his church has either helped people pay outstanding hydro bills or given them pre-paid grocery cards because they can’t afford groceries after paying for electricity. Horrobin raised his concerns during an anti-poverty roundtable held by Progressive Conservative MPP Monte McNaughton, whose Lambton-Kent-Middlesex riding is almost the size of Prince Edward Island and takes in vast rural reaches where electricity delivery rates are higher than in many urban areas. \n“A story that hit home for me is that a number of churches in North Kent are now raiding benevolent funds to pay people’s hydro bills . . . because they can’t afford to pay those bills (since) the costs have gone up so much,” McNaughton said.\nErnie Hardeman, the MPP for Oxford, said social agencies and churches in his riding are also reporting more people coming to them seeking relief from energy bills.\n“Just coming in and getting help with food just doesn’t seem to do it anymore, because their hydro bill is a bigger problem than not being able to get their groceries,” he said.\nMcNaughton said he plans to share the results of his anti-poverty meetings with Liberal MPP Ted McMeekin, who has struck a rural task force on poverty.\nWhen politicians talk about poverty, McNaughton said, too often they refer to Toronto and urban areas. “It’s time Queen’s Park starts thinking outside of Toronto and outside of cities to realize that people are falling behind in small-town Ontario,” he said.\nMcMeekin said when it comes to the impact of hydro prices on Ontarians, “there’s no news there, that’s been evident for some time.”\nAcknowledging they’ve struggled with the issue, the Hamilton-area MPP said the Liberals’ recent moves to lower costs, including reducing delivery charges that sent bills soaring, will help. By this summer, he said, no one will be paying more than the average monthly delivery charge in Toronto, which is $38.\nLate last year, Wynne called Ontario’s high electricity prices her “mistake” and vowed to fix them.\nBut Hardeman, a former agriculture minister, is critical of Wynne’s promise, calling it a “Band-Aid” fix that doesn’t address structural problems.\n“The premier says she’s solving the problem, and yet she’s done nothing about changing the system,” he said.\nThe Liberals have stood by their handling of the energy file, noting they closed Ontario’s dirty coal-fired power plants in favour of green energy.\nBut critics point out the government’s plunge into green energy since 2009, which greatly expanded wind- and solar-generated power, included sweetheart long-term contracts that guaranteed energy producers far more than what consumers pay for power, inflating the cost.\nMcMeekin said he’s been saying all along the delivery charges weren’t fair, and the government listened.\nThe Liberals inherited problems with the electricity system from the former PC government, he said, citing the frequent number of smog days Ontario had then — a problem aggravated by coal-fired power — and the 2003 blackout, when power plants across Ontario scrambled to get the province’s grid operational after 50 million North Americans were plunged into darkness. \nHe noted a $50-billion investment was made to upgrade the power system, and “somebody’s got to pay for that.”\nThe government’s plan to lower hydro costs takes the pressure off that bill, essentially spreading the pain over a longer period, like remortgaging a house, at an added cost of $25 billion in interest.\nThe plan also contains a delivery charge reduction for some rural customers, removing the charge entirely for on-reserve First Nations customers, and expanding a low-income support program. \nDeputy Premier Deb Matthews of London said the government heard Ontarians “loud and clear” on hydro.\n“Electricity prices are a big deal for the people of this province,” she said, adding “that is why we came out strongly with a significant reduction.” \n– With files from Dale Carruthers and Norman Debono, Postmedia News, and The Canadian Press \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T15:10:16.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
