By Diane Schmidt Updated June 10, 2016 . \nEveryone's different: some love packing and hate unpacking and others feel the opposite. I prefer to pack than unpack. That means I need a plan before I start to unpack so I’m not lost among all those boxes and feel overwhelmed by everything I need to do. So, to help you keep your unpacking organized , here are my suggestions of how to get your home unpacked. 1. Know What You're Unpacking \nFirst, make sure you have a copy of the inventory list; either the one that the mover’s provided or the one that you previously created as part of your home inventory 2. Unpack What You'll Need to Keep Your Home Running. \nNext, unpack the essentials box . This should be one of the first boxes off the truck or something you moved with you in the car. If it isn’t, then keep an eye out for it. This should contain everything you need for a couple of nights. 3. Get the Kitchen Done First \nNow unpack the kitchen. If you’ve properly labeled the boxes, you should be able to locate what you need fairly easily. \ncontinue reading below our video How to Make a Room Feel Bigger If you have time, I strongly suggest that you line the cupboards first. If you don’t have time, unpack only what you need, including pots and pans. Get the major appliances hooked up and any small appliances that will make your life a little easier – like the coffee pot and toaster. You can concentrate on completely organizing the kitchen after the rest of the house is unpacked. 4. Bedrooms are Next \nPut the beds together and unpack the linens for each bedroom. If you followed my sister’s tip and put the set of linens that usually accompany each bed in separate see-through bags, getting the beds ready for your first night should be pretty easy. \nBedrooms can be unpacked by each member of the family. Again, furniture placement or closet organization should be done first before you unpack. 5. Bathrooms are Essential, too \nNow unpack the bathroom. Again, unpack the things that are most important, such as medication (which should go in your essential’s box), the shower curtain and towels. 6. Put Together Furniture \nIf you were fortunate enough to obtain plans to your new home before you moved, then arranging furniture should be fairly straightforward. If you need to rearrange furniture in the bedrooms, living room and dining room, make a plan first so you only have to do it once. Large pieces that need assembling should be completed once you know where furniture will be placed. 7. Storage Spaces Can be Unpacked Last \nOne of the last rooms to unpack is the garage. Since most garage items aren’t essential, try to organize the space before you start to unpack. Get the tools you need to keep the space functional. This may include extra shelving, storage boxes , etc… \nThe patio items can be unpacked and set up at your own leisure. If we’re moving in the summer, we often set-up the barbecue first, just so we can cook without needing pots or pans or many utensils; many of our first meals have been eaten right off the tinfoil they were cooked in. Little fuss and very little cleanup. It’s a great way to lessen the work when there’s so much else to do. \nOnce you have the main essential unpacking completed, try to take some time to enjoy your new space. Set a few hours aside each day or on the weekend so you know you’ll get the job done. This will also assure you that you can take the time to get to know your new neighborhood . More Tips to Get Your Home Unpacked Fast Get the essentials unpacked first, then take your time with the rest of the house. Plan the room first before you unpack too many boxes . Get the tools you need to make the space work for you. Then when you unpack, you'll have just the right place for your things. If you think that you'll do a task later - such as lining the cupboards or organizing the closet - that's a sign that you should do the task now or you'll never get to it. Make the space your own. Hang pictures and place family photos around the house early in your unpacking. It will help to make the space feel familiar and comfortable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T19:16:10.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
