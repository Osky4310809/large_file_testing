Believe me,\" Trump continued, acknowledging the sacrifice military families also make for the country. \nThe bulk of Trump's remarks focused on efforts to defeat radical Islamic terror, in addition to reiteration of his stance that NATO allies must allocate proper funds for their defense. \n\"We face a vicious enemy that has no respect for human life...No enemy stands a chance against our special forces and that's the way we're going to keep it. You're going to be better off because you're going to have the finest equipment known to man,\" Trump said. \"We strongly support NATO, we only asks all our NATO members make their proper contributions.\" \nTrump said ISIS is on a rampage and engaging in genocide across the world, citing attacks in San Bernardino, Paris and Nice as examples. \n\"We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and we will not allow it to take root in our country,\" Trump said. \"As your President, I have no higher duty than to protect the American people.\" \nIn closing, Trump referred to Reagan's mantra of \"peace through strength,\" and said freedom, security and justice will prevail. \n\"The men and women of the United States military bring America the strength it needs to pursue peace,\" Trump said. \"We are prepared to fight, but we pray for peace.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:30:09.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
