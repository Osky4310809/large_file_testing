Snap’s pricing is below its initial range of $20 billion-$25 billion — and below what it raised at in its last equity round — but it still promises to be the highest valued U.S. tech IPO since Alibaba, which went public in a record $25 billion offering in 2014 . In addition, the less aggressive price setting could also drive interest from investors. \nThere’s been no absence in hype, too. Snap’s IPO is long-awaited, particularly since AppDynamics ducked out of what was poised to the year’s first tech listing after Cisco paid $3.7 billion to acquire the firm right before its debut. \nSnapchat filed its papers on February 2 , opening up a vat of previously unconfirmed data around its business and usage, including that revenue grew six-fold to $400 million last year and losses widened to $515 million. The company also revealed it has 161 million daily active users, most of whom are based in the U.S. and Western Europe. As we reported , the firm hasn’t made significant progress in international markets like Asia while Instagram Stories — the best-placed of Facebook’s many Snapchat clones — appears to be stealing both users and high-profile celebs who can win attention among users. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T17:58:22.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
