(AFP file photo) \nOne polling booth in South Goa’s Margao constituency that faced technical faults during Saturday’s voting will go to the polls again on Tuesday . \nThe Election Commission on Sunday decided to go ahead with re-polling on polling station number 8 of TB Cunha area in Margao constituency, after the voting machines failed to clear the mock votes polled on February 4. Some 800 voters were therefore affected due to this faulty error. \n“We had spotted these errors and had therefore decided to recommend the Election Commission to consider re-polling. Our sectoral officers and the returning officer had also submitted their reports to the commission, to which the election commission agreed and notified to go ahead with re-election in that area,” Kunal, the chief electoral officer, said. \nThe voting in the area will be carried out from 7am to 5pm on Tuesday. tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:59:14.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
