Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA Tory councillor has been suspended over a retweet that compared Diane Abbott to an ape wearing lipstick. \nAlan Pearmain, who was deputy chairman of South Ribble Conservative Association, now faces an investigation after the message was reported to the Labour Party . \nThe original tweet showed an ape with the captions \"forget the London look, get the Diane Abbott look\" and \"let's get fatty back in a zoo!\". \nIt was retweeted in December by a Twitter account named \"alanpps\" with the added comment: \"Nice lips kid. But a shade too much rouge\". \nThe Lancashire Post revealed the account - which boasts to be from a \"Tory activist positioned slightly to the right of Attilla the Hun\" - was run by Mr Pearmain, a parish councillor near Preston. \nLocal Labour councillor Keith Martin, who first reported the tweet, claimed it was \"bringing [the Conservative] party into disrepute\".

I'm old enough to remember what used to go on in the last 1970s and early 1980s and it resembles that, which I hoped as a society we had moved on from. \n\"I think he should think carefully of his position.\" \nWhen contacted by the Guardian, Mr Pearmain said: “Can you tell me what’s wrong with the tweet? I thought it was her size and her appearance, nothing to do with colour.\" Ms Abbott previously described the type of abuse she has received online \nA Conservative Party spokesman confirmed: \"His comments are completely unacceptable and he has been suspended from the party, pending an investigation.\" \nA source close to the Shadow Home Secretary said her office has not reported Mr Pearmain's tweet to police, instead leaving the regional Labour officials to decide what action to take. \nHowever, Ms Abbott's staff have reported other \"racist and abusive\" and \"threatening\" messages to police recently. \nThose are understood to include one e-mail this week which called her a \"pathetic useless fat black piece of... pondslime\" who should be hanged. \nMs Abbott warned of the tide of abuse she had received as an MP last year, saying: \"We've had regular rape threats. We've had pornographic pictures of black women with my head superimposed e-mailed to every MP. \n\"My staff get abuse. I'm called a n****r and a b**** and an animal.\" \nMr Pearmain has been contacted for comment.
