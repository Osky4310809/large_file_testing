Sure, good genes have no doubt helped Brinkley keep her stunning physique over the decades. But Brinkley told SHAPE that she has also remained committed to plenty of cardio, yoga, and outdoor activities like surfing and running on the beach. And if her new Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue spread is any indication, all her hard work has paid off in spades. \nIn this Instagram photo, Brinkley shares a snapshot from her recent SI shoot with her two daughters—31-year-old Alexa Ray Joel, and 18-year-old Sailor Brinkley Cook. “My first thought was, ‘At my age? No way!’ ” Brinkley told PEOPLE . “When I turned 30, I was like, ‘This is the last time I’m posing in a bathing suit.’ But to get to do it with my girls, I thought, ‘One last go!’” \nBrinkley’s “one last go” has brought the former supermodel back into the limelight. But her comeback got us thinking: What other celebrities over the age of 50 look just as incredible as they did in their 20s and 30s, if not more beautiful? The strong, sexy ladies on this list have also put in decades of work in the gym to maintain their amazing bodies. Hey Sports Illustrated : Better make room for these women in next year’s Swimsuit Issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:54:13.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
