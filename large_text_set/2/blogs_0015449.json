Long An, predictably weren’t happy with the referee, but their response was … extreme. \nUpset with the call, Long An decided to protest it by refusing to play on. \nTheir goalkeeper refused to try stopping the penalty and when they wouldn’t take the ensuing kickoff, the ref gave it to Ho Chi Minh City, who dribbled the length of the field without a Long An player trying to stop it. And then the same thing happened again. \nThat is absolutely wild. \nA 2-2 game became 5-2 because of a penalty call and Long An decided to completely quit on the game. Or protest it.
