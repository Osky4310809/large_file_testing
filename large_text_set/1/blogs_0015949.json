(AP Photo, File) This handout photo from the U.S. Air Force, shows the water column from the underwater atom bomb blast in the lagoon of the Bikini Atoll Islands rise through the disintegrating vapor cloud, on July 25, 1946. The cloud formed a derby-like mantle around the column for an instant, then disappeared quickly. The water mushroomed out after the column reached a height of 5,500 feet and fell back into the lagoon to engulf most of ships of the target fleet. Two of the ships are at right, at the edge of the shock wave which rippled out over the surface of the lagoon from the rising water column. Bikini Island, about three miles from the point of the explosion, is in the background.
