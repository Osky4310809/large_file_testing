ID: 10374476 “If Adani actually ever employs Australians we’ll have people ready to apply who care more about the reef and tourism jobs than extra profit for multibillionaire [Adani owner] Gautam Adani,” Pennings said.\n“If [its] Galilee Basin mega-mine ever gets financed, we will ask all Adani employees to act according to their conscience. This could include blowing the whistle on corrupt practices, unsafe workplaces, or providing information to environment groups wanting to protect the reef and Great Artesian Basin.”\nBuzzFeed News understands that several activist groups including veterans of the Leard and Jabiluka blockades, lawyers, and IT specialists met in Sydney over the weekend to talk strategy.\nPennings, a veteran environmental activist and former Greens candidate for Brisbane lord mayor, is keen to distance the Australian movement from the recently successful Standing Rock protest in the United States.

Hundreds of millions of climate refugees. It’s insanity on an ecological scale, but also insanity on a human scale.”\nPennings said the Blockade has already been contacted by people on the inside with some companies associated with Adani.
