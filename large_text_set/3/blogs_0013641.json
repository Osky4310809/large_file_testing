(Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports) 19   \nFor fantasy owners in keeper leagues, finding high-ceiling young players is essential to building a roster that’s competitive every year. That’s why we’ve tailored our prospect rankings to the skills that impact fantasy categories the most. And while immediate production is great, this list is geared toward formats where long-term upside is paramount. \nOne thing to keep in mind: we’re going on the assumption that players who have already made their major league debuts or are entering the majors from another professional league aren’t treated as prospects in most fantasy formats. That’s why you won’t see Yoan Moncada, Dansby Swanson and Yulieski Gurriel on our list, even though they all qualify as rookies in 2016. Top 15 rookies set to make an impact for fantasy owners in 2017 \n1. SS Gleyber Torres, New York Yankees. The MVP of the Arizona Fall League and the centerpiece of the Aroldis Chapman trade with the Chicago Cubs, Torres has shown a superior hit tool for someone who just turned 20. \nAgainst some of the best prospects in the game this fall, a teenage Torres hit .403 in 62 at-bats, with a .513 OBP (14 walks, 8 strikeouts) and a 1.158 OPS. And in limited action this spring, he’s continued to blister the ball at a similar clip. \nHe’s expected to open the season at Class AA Tampa, but it wouldn’t be a shock to see him get a late-season call-up. Keeper league owners should watch how his power develops in the minors this season. He may be too good to keep off the roster in 2018. \n2. OF Austin Meadows, Pittsburgh Pirates. There’s no room in the Pirates outfield right now, but Meadows, 21, could force his way onto the roster at some point this season to assist in a potential playoff push. (It helps that he can play all three outfield positions.) \nHe has a smooth left-handed stroke that so far has translated into far more doubles than homers. But at 6-3 and 200 pounds there’s plenty of projectability to his skill set, especially when he’s already shown a disciplined eye at the plate – posting a .300/.368/.480 line in four minor league seasons since the Pirates drafted him ninth overall in 2013. The one thing that’s held him back so far, however, has been injuries. \n3. 1B Cody Bellinger, Los Angeles Dodgers. You don’t find too many first basemen on top prospect lists, but Bellinger is an exception. He’s a left-handed power hitter and the heir apparent to Adrian Gonzalez in L.A. \n“I swing to do damage on the ball, that’s the biggest thing. Not always home runs, but I want to make hard contact. That’s my goal,” Bellinger, 21, told me earlier this spring. That approach has resulted in 56 homers and 174 RBI over the past two seasons as he advanced from High Class A to a brief stint at Class AAA last September. He also made an excellent showing in the AFL, posting a .314/.424/.557 slash line in 70 at-bats. \nThe son of former MLB infielder Clay Bellinger, he’s also a good enough athlete that he could see some time in the outfield, which could hasten his arrival in the majors even further. Fantasy baseball rankings: Overall Top 200 for 2017 \n4. SS Amed Rosario, New York Mets. Off the prospect radar last season, Rosario took a huge step forward with a .324/.374/.459 showing at High Class A and AA as a 20-year-old. With plus speed and the ability to drive the ball to all fields, he conjures images of a young Jose Reyes – who was a fantasy star when he first came up with the Mets from 2005-11. \nAll it could take is one injury in the Mets middle infield for Rosario to get a shot this season. He’s an excellent athlete and should be able to handle the defensive side of things as his bat gets up to speed. \n5. OF Eloy Jimenez, Chicago Cubs. Fantasy owners may have to wait a while before Jimenez reaches the majors, but from all indications it’ll be worth it. He made his mark last season at Class A, hitting .329 with 14 homers, 40 doubles, 81 RBI and leading the pitcher-friendly Midwest League with .901 OPS – at age 19. \nBut what really got him noticed was the home run and spectacular catch he made at the All-Star Futures Game. At 6-4 and 205 pounds, Jimenez is an electrifying performer who can hit the ball hard to all fields with relative ease. \n6. OF Victor Robles, Washington Nationals. Another precocious teen, Robles has the speed to steal plenty of bases (he had 37 in 110 minor league games last season) and be an outstanding defensive center fielder. But what’s particularly exciting is his advanced plate discipline at such a young age. \nOver three seasons in the minors, Robles – who doesn’t turn 20 until May 19 – has compiled a .401 on-base percentage to go with his still-developing power. Once he’s ready for the majors (possibly in 2018), he could develop into a true five-tool player. \n7. SS Brendan Rodgers, Colorado Rockies. Yet another talented youngster in what’s shaping up to be a golden age for shortstops, Rodgers comes with the prospect pedigree – and high expectations – of being the No. 3 overall pick in 2015. \nThe Rockies are pretty well set at short with Trevor Story, so Rodgers, 20, has also seen some action at second base. Either way, they’ll give him all the time he needs to develop his skills in the minors. So far, so good. He hit .281 with 19 home runs and 73 RBI in 110 games last season and was named the top prospect in the Low-A South Atlantic League. MLB's 100 Names You Need to Know for 2017 \n8. 3B Nick Senzel, Cincinnati Reds. The second overall pick in last year’s draft, Senzel showed the maturity of a major college hitter (Tennessee) and Cape Cod Summer League MVP as he put up excellent numbers in his first exposure to pro ball. \nAfter a short stint in the rookie league, the 21-year-old hit .329/.415/.567 in 58 games with low Class A Dayton. He showed both power and speed with seven homers and 15 steals. Senzel was probably the most major league-ready prospect in the 2016 draft class – and his smooth transition only helped to reinforce that impression. \n9. 3B Rafael Devers, Boston Red Sox. The Sox dealt away a couple of their top prospects this offseason (see below) to land Chris Sale, but the cupboard is far from bare. Devers, 20, is a powerfully built left-handed hitter who added speed to his resume last season at High Class A, stealing 18 bases in 24 attempts. \nPablo Sandoval is signed through 2019, which should be perfect timing for Devers to take over at the hot corner, assuming he doesn’t hit his way onto the roster before then. He should begin this season at Class AA. \n10. SP Michael Kopech, Chicago White Sox. The rebuilding process on Chicago’s South Side got a huge kick-start with the Sale trade, as they landed last season’s No. 1 prospect (Moncada) and this year’s No. 10. \nKopech has a huge arm, with a fastball that occasionally hits triple digits, and a slider and changeup that can be plus pitches as well. He struck out 82 batters in 52 innings at Class A (14.2 K/9), but did have trouble with his control (5.3 BB/9). The 20-year-old showed better command in the AFL, where he turned in an impressive performance as one of the starters in the Fall Stars Game. Red Sox SP Michael Kopech has 3 K's in 2 IP.
