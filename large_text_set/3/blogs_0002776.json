Early Saturday morning without warning Trump tweeted that President Obama had Trump’s phones wiretapped in his home in Trump Towers. The time line given was “ just before the November election ,” according to USA Today. \nTrump’s several tweets were quite shocking, as the accusations were harsh, but they came with no evidence at all offered up. It didn’t take too long for Obama’s camp to offer up their thoughts and as Fox New s live reports,“they were fired up.” Obama Team Denies Trump's Claims About Wiretapping https://t.co/O9WG556p6o pic.twitter.com/nZvH5X1UmH \n— ThePoliticalLanguage (@The_PoliticalUS) March 4, 2017 \nThe tweets that Donald Trump sent out this morning appear below and as you can see he even suggests legal action by stating, “I’d bet a good lawyer can make a great case.” Trump refers to this wiretapping as a “fact” that Obama was tapping Trump’s phones. Despite Trump calling his accusations a “fact,” so far there is no evidence provided by the president to back this up. Is it legal for a sitting President to be \"wire tapping\" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 \nFox News reports that Obama denied Trump’s wiretapping accusations in a statement released by his camp. This is seen in the tweet below. Obama spox: Trump’s allegation that Obama had him wiretapped is “simply false” \n(Doesn't deny wiretapping happened—denies Obama ordered it) pic.twitter.com/0YyxhL1Twd \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 4, 2017 \nAccording to USA Today , it would take a warrant approved by a FISA court judge to get Trump’s phones tapped. If Trump were truly “privy to information that his phone was indeed tapped” it would suggest that that probable cause was found by the FISA court for them to issue a warrant. With this said, will Trump’s tweets backfire on him? An Obama spokesperson said Trump's wiretapping claim is 'simply false' https://t.co/QHF5wPCml2 \n— CNBC (@CNBC) March 4, 2017 \nOne of the talking points that was brought up on Fox News live Saturday afternoon is that Trump shouldn’t wait too long to bring this wiretapping evidence forth. The longer he waits, the more time this gives Obama’s camp to get their ducks in a row and possibly use Trump’s accusations to derail Trump’s attempt of painting Obama in a bad light. The longer Trump waits, the more time Obama’s camp has to turn this around on him. \nUSA Today reports that Trump’s tweets were posted on the heels of Rush Limbaugh making accusations that there is a “silent coup,” which is orchestrated by Obama to “unseat Trump.” Limbaugh also said on his radio show Friday that Obama is attempting to paint Trump “effectively immaterial” when it comes to being the nation’s president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T00:44:06.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
