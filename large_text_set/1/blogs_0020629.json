They don't get relegated, they still get paid... But that's the structure of U.S. sports and you have to respect it.\" \nMLS has long resisted calls to implement the system of promotion and relegation common in most of the world's top league. Commissioner Don Garber said in December the league has found success by following the example of other U.S. sports leagues that also feature a closed structure. \nAncelotti also noted that the MLS system leads to a more level playing field. \n\"I spent a lot of time in Canada last year and watched a lot of MLS,\" he said. \"It's different, it's a different approach, the way everything is structured is geared towards a spectacle, towards parity, rather than flat-out dog-eat-dog competition.\" \nThe Bayern boss also said he would not advise top players to leave Europe while still in their primes, as his fellow Italian Sebastian Giovinco did by joining Toronto FC at age 27 in 2015. \n\"I think as long as you can stay at or near the top of the football world, that's what you do,\" Ancelotti said. \"And right now, the pinnacle is right here in Europe.\" \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T20:25:05.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
