Jordan is a part of a U.S.-led military coalition against the IS, which holds territory in Syria and Iraq. Hanged at dawn \nThe men were hanged at dawn on Saturday at Swaqa Prison in central Jordan, government spokesman Mohammed Momani said in a statement carried by state news agency Petra. \nFive others were executed for other crimes, including rape, he said. \nMr. Momani said the assailants executed for terror convictions had been involved in five different incidents, from a 2003 bombing attack on Jordan’s embassy in Iraq to the September 2016 shooting of outspoken writer Nahed Hattar in the Jordanian capital of Amman. \nAlso listed was a 2006 shooting attack on a group of tourists at a Roman theater in the center of Amman. A British man was killed in the attack. \nSaad Hattar, a cousin of the victim, said that while the killer was punished, those who instigated such attacks with hateful rhetoric were not. \n“The murderer was just a tool, and our society needs the uprooting of the ideology and the culture behind him,” Mr. Saad Hattar, a journalist, told AP. After IS video \nJordan intensified a campaign against suspected Islamic extremists after the IS released a video in early 2015, showing its militants burning to death the fighter pilot as he was trapped in a cage. In response to the video, Jordan executed two prisoners linked to the al-Qaeda terror network, a precursor of the IS. \nJordanian authorities have dismissed support for the IS in the kingdom as a fringe phenomenon and said security forces can contain any threat. However, there has been a rise in attacks in Jordan linked to Islamic extremists over the past year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T11:38:14.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
