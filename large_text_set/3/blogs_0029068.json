I cannot find peace in my city and my country.” \nHe was among about three dozen refugees at a ceremony organized by City Councilman David Oh. \n“I wanted to make sure that they understood that we welcome them to our city, and that way they can feel settled and begin to become contributing Philadelphians,” Oh said. \nIllihan has a job as a chef, but he’s concerned because he doesn’t know when his family — who fled to Jordan — will be able to join him here. \nThree-year-old Laith and his family fled war-ravaged Aleppo – after mortar shells forced them from their home. \n“She’s so happy that she’s living between nice people and welcoming people,” said interpreter for refugee Ghufran Smakiaa. \nLittle Laith and his family now call Philadelphia home. Their refugee status gives them a year before they’ll be eligible to apply for green cards. \n“They’ve been in a very terrible place, with a lot of tragedy, and I think that’s a story familiar to generations of Americans,” said Oh. \nThe family is also here for life-preserving medical care. \n“She also has a sick daughter that she needs to go to a regular basis to the hospital for dialysis for her kidneys,” said Smakiaa via her translator. \nThe process of fleeing the land of the Bashar al-Assad regime has been sad, long and drawn out, they say. \nThese refugees are now seeking work, while acclimating to a new a city, culture, and schools. \n“Many people in our city welcome them with open arms, and a kind heart which I think reflects the best traditions of America and certainly the city of Philadelphia,” said Oh. \nAfter the green card is obtained, there is another four-year wait to become a U.S. citizen. \nJoe Holden facebook Follow Joe Holden came home to join the Eyewitness News team as a general assignment reporter in May, 2016.
