The cast got together for a mini-sequel to raise awareness for Red Nose Day , and the internet has been speculating like crazy since the news broke about what part two might look like. \nA little background before we go on: Red Nose Day is a high-profile comedy-focused biennial telethon that raises money, via a charity called Comic Relief, to help people who need an education, immunization, help escaping domestic violence, and mental health support. It's a big thing in the U.K., where Red Nose Day took place yesterday, March 24—and raised £71 million (about $88.5 million). The U.S.'s version of the day , meanwhile, will take place on NBC on May 25. \nIn the midst of yesterday's telethon, the Love Actually sequel dropped. (It'll show again in the U.S. on Red Nose Day, too.) Ready for some storyline closure? \nWarning: spoilers ahead! \nThe video starts with Juliet and Peter (still married) watching television together—until Mark comes to the door with his classic cue cards. Surprise: He's married to Kate Moss , just like he predicted. We also get to see what's been going on with most of the other stars of the movie, like Hugh Grant's character, who's back in office as Prime Minister after five years off. He pulls an Obama and boogies to Drake's \"Hotline Bling—and yes, Natalie is still putting up with those dance moves. \nBilly Mack is raising money for Red Nose Day with a new song called \"Give Me All Your Money\" (of course) and reveals a surprising hookup. Rufus is still creating gift-wrapping masterpieces, and Jamie and Aurélia are communicating better than ever. They have three children, and Aurélia is pregnant with a fourth. \nThen we see Sam, who is now 26 (they grow up so fast)—and Joanna, who asks for Daniel's blessing to marry his son (snaps for flipping gender norms, Joanna!). \nIt's Grant's speech that really drives home the importance of Red Nose Day—but what else do you expect from a guy who makes the best speeches? \"Today is Red Nose Day, and people are giving their hard-earned cash to people they'll never meet but whose pain and fear they feel and want to fight. So, it's not only romantic love that's all around—most people still, every day, everywhere, have enough love in their heart to help other human beings in trouble. Good's going to win. I'm actually sure of it,\" he says. \nWatch the full video below: \nIt's exactly the kind of heartwarming video we could all use from time to time. And best of all, it's all for a good cause. Happy holidays— erm , happy Saturday—and be sure to set a reminder for America's Red Nose Day on May 25. \nRelated Stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:21:56.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
