Matthew Mueller Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of \nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child never struggled when it came to ticket sales, but despite the success of the play, J.K. Rowling has said that it will act as the final chapter in Harry Potter's journey. \nWell, maybe not so fast on that last part. Some recent comments were made by Jim Hill, a theme park historian and journalist with massive contacts at Disney and Universal, that may contradict earlier remarks from the studios and Rowling that Cursed Child would indeed be the final piece of Harry's story on film. \nHill appeared on the Unofficial Universal Orlando Podcast to discuss a myriad of topics regarding Universal Orlando ( via ScreenRant ). During the conversation, Hill made mention of the current contract between NBCUniversal and Warner Bros., specifically a clause that allows NBCUniversal the exclusive broadcast rights for all Potter and Fantastic Beasts films from July 1, 2018, forward. \n\"They not only have Potter, they have Fantastic Beasts and, supposedly, if you drill down into the language of the deal, they also have – when they’re finally made – the trilogy of movies that will be based on Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\" \nThat last part is the most noteworthy addition, as the studio hasn't said anything about wanting to make a trilogy of the Cursed Child, though most fans assumed that was going to be the case somewhere down the line. Hill went on to say that Warner Bros. might have already had conversations with Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Daniel Radcliffe about a possible project. \n\"I have heard that Warner Bros. has actually had conversations with [Emma Watson], with Rupert [Grint], and, of course, Daniel [Radcliffe] about Cursed Child, ‘cause they want this to be, for lack of a better term, Harry Potter: The Force Awakens. They want this trilogy of movies to have the actors that we know and love from the original films, that we watched grow up, as adults. And, of course, they’re hiring a bunch of new, younger actors to play their children with the hope that, “If we can lean on J.K. [Rowling], maybe there’ll be The Cursed Adolescent.” \nThat is certainly an interesting development, and would allow the actors to get on wit their careers while also passing on the torch to a new group of stars for future films. Whether it happens or not, who knows, but it is certainly worth revisiting once Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them has started to run its course. \nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an all-new adventure returning us to the wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling. Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) stars in the central role of wizarding world magizoologist Newt Scamander, under the direction of David Yates, who helmed the last four Harry Potter blockbusters. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them opens in 1926 as Newt Scamander has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures. Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have come and gone without incident…were it not for a No-Maj (American for Muggle) named Jacob, a misplaced magical case, and the escape of some of Newt’s fantastic beasts, which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds. \nFantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them is on DVD, Blu-ray, and Digital storefronts now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T03:02:19.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
