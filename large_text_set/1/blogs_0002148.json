[13] Etymology \nEnglish expel , meaning \"remove\" and armus , derived from the dative of arma, armis means \"from the arms\". So Expelliarmus means \"removement from the arm. \" Behind the scenes \" Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand \" â€”Dumbledore's use on Snape [src] This is the signature spell of Harry Potter. In the films only when a witch or wizard is locked in the Priori Incantatem is the spell scarlet. When not locked in combat it's always just a blue or white flash that will either connect with the target's hand and force the wand out of their hand or will blast them off their feet, sometimes unconscious. When Dumbledore used this on Snape , it appeared as white lightning, and hence was probably a variation of it rather than the spell itself, or else an entirely different disarming spell. The charm is described in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 , and has a spellbook purely for itself. In the second film, it appears as a golden ring; from the fifth film onward it was a ball or flash of blue light. In the video games, mainly he console versions of the first and second games, the Disarming Charm worked rather like a Shield Charm, rebounding an opponent's spells upon them. This is actually also the describing of the spell in the The Standard Book of Spells series. This was mainly due to the lack of being able to disarm in past video games. However, the spell returned to its more offensive use by the Order of the Phoenix game , though the GBC version of the Chamber of Secrets game also follows this scheme. Also in the console version of the second game , it's possible to catch and deflect spells not only cast by prefects in the PS2 version, but it's also possible to do so on one's own backfired spell. This only works on Flipendo and Incendio however, as the other projectile spells will pass through. In the case of the former, it moves rather fast so tight timing to activate the charm is needed. The Disarming Charm is referenced on Doctor Who , when Shakespeare uses it to conclude a formula used to banish the villains from earth. The Doctor (played by David Tennant ) smiles after the villains are beaten and says: \"Good old J.K. \", referencing the author of the Harry Potter series. As seen in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 , it is possible to disarm and take ownership of one's wand without using the spell, as demonstrated by Harry, who forcefully disarmed Malfoy with his bare hands to take the latter's wand. In the film versions of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Hermione Granger used the spell to make Mundungus Fletcher's wand fly over to her for her to catch it, which also happened when Harry Potter defeated Tom Riddle during Voldemort's Last Stand , in a similar way to the Summoning Charm . For Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , the Summoning Charm is shown to be capable of summoning wands over to a user to disarm others like the Disarming Charm does, as Porpentina Goldstein used it to disarm a subdued Gellert Grindelwald , sending the wand over to her for her to catch it.
