Joe, and Hercules. But in the upcoming Baywatch , he’s playing his most hard-hitting role yet: lifeguard. In the brand-new trailer below, Johnson rides ATVs down the beach like a badass. Then you have Zac Efron in an American flag Speedo, which is at minimum a confirmation that the star has been taking his protein since graduating from High School Musical . And then you have the likes of Alexandra Daddario and Priyanka Chopra to sweeten the pot—because the only thing better than any insanely fit all-star cast is an insanely fit all-star case clad entirely in beachwear. This movie is going to be nuts. \nBut The Rock has been in a bunch of nuts movies before—i.e. the entire Fast series, and San Andreas , where he essentially fist-fights an earthquake—so why see Baywatch ? Because it’s damn shameless, that’s why. No one is fully clothed; everyone is ripped out of their mind. Somehow there are hot pursuit scenes and yacht explosions, drugs and fistfights. And yes, Pamela Anderson is in it, too. Is Baywatch anything like the experience of real-life lifeguards? No. Will it be a ton of fun and serve as awesome motivation for the rest of us to hit the gym before beach season? Absolutely.
