They just don’t seem to give us any answers to our repeated requests,” Schedler told The Daily Caller . \nConnecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill, a Democrat and current president of the NASS, echoed those concerns. \n“We were continually asking them ‘what does this mean, what will it cover, what are the implications?’ And we sort of never got anything back,” Merrill said. \nGeneral John Kelly, the current Secretary of Homeland Security, originally declared his opposition to the federal declaration during his confirmation hearings, suggesting it “appears to be a political question beyond the scope of DHS’ current legislative cyber mandates.” \nDespite his initial comment, Kelly apparently reversed his opinion on February 7, saying “I would argue that, yes, we should keep that (designation) in place.” NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.
