Most Popular By Sammy Nickalls Feb 23, 2017 Though The Shining is perhaps one of the most well-known horror films to date, one of the people who is responsible for its creation wants no part of it. Stephen King has not been shy about his distaste for Stanley Kubrick's twist on his novel, but has time changed the author's mind? According to a recent tweet, nope, doesn't seem like it. What're your top 5 @StephenKing joints? https://t.co/3UdXUPYxNi \n— Blumhouse (@blumhouse) February 22, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below When Blumhouse Productions tweeted a video of the top five Stephen King films asking \"What're your top 5 [sic] @StephenKing joints?\" they got an answer from King himself. Just three words, but they speak volumes: \"Not this one.\" @blumhouse Not this one. \n— Stephen King (@StephenKing) February 22, 2017 Most Popular Back in 2014, King didn't mince words about the film either when he spoke with Rolling Stone , but he used more than three: \n\"The book is hot, and the movie is cold; the book ends in fire, and the movie in ice. In the book, there's an actual arc where you see this guy, Jack Torrance, trying to be good, and little by little he moves over to this place where he's crazy. And as far as I was concerned, when I saw the movie, Jack was crazy from the first scene. I had to keep my mouth shut at the time. It was a screening, and Nicholson was there. But I'm thinking to myself the minute he's on the screen, 'Oh, I know this guy. I've seen him in five motorcycle movies, where Jack Nicholson played the same part.' And it's so misogynistic. Wendy Torrance is just presented as this sort of screaming dishrag.\" Related Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:06:06.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
