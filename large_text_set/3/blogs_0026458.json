Earlier this week , his family confirmed that Chuck was on its way, and now, they’ve released the first single from the upcoming set. \nAnd lest fans worry that turning 90 had siphoned off some of Berry’s legendary musical style, “Big Boys” is unmistakable Chuck: school-days nostalgia, backed up with energetic guitar licks and hooting, high-spirited vocals. Featuring appearances from Rage Against The Machine’s Tom Morello and blues guitarist Nathaniel Rateliff, it’s a healthy sign that Chuck —out June 16—will be a worthy addition to the canon of a rock legend, rather than a simple posthumous nostalgia trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:18:26.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
