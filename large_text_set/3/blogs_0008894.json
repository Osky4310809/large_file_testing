This new authority is a shift from a policy under former President Barack Obama that limited the CIA’s ability to engage in paramilitary activity, and may very well strain relations between the agency and the Pentagon. © REUTERS/ Carlos Barria Vault 7: Disgruntled CIA Workers Sent an Important Message to President Trump \nAs a part of Trump plan’s to ramp up the program to destroy Daesh, the agency first used it’s new secret power in late February, against a senior al Qaeda leader in Syria, Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, who was also the son-in-law of deceased al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. \nMasri’s death was made public, but until recently it was not known that the CIA carried out the strike.
