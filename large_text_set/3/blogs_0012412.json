It's definitely one of my go-to albums to this day,\" to which Scott replied: \n\"Not me. I think we've written 10 albums with better songs than that one.\" \n\"Fistful of Metal\" is the only Anthrax album to feature singer Neil Turbin, who was in the band between 1982 and 1984. Some of the highlight tracks include \" Deathrider ,\" \" Metal Thrashing Mad \" and the album's sole single, \" Soldiers of Metal .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T10:10:38.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
