headquarters in Brussels \n“We all know that no deal is better than a bad deal and that it will harm the rest of the EU more than us.” \nHe added: “If Juncker tries this trick then we should just leave.” \nSenior Tory MP Peter Bone said: “Juncker and Barnier are just part of the European elite who are in a completely different world to ordinary people. \n“The real issue for them is whether they can survive without the UK not whether the UK can survive without the EU.” GETTY Mr Juncker's comments have been called 'ludicrous' and 'spiteful' \nHe went on: “They are kidding themselves if they think the UK is the only country that wants to leave. \n“This is a dying organisation which is in danger of collapsing.” \nHe added: “Juncker is a leader who is completely out of touch with the people he is supposed to represent across Europe. \n“If we need to leave without a deal then it will still be better than staying in the EU.” \nRichard Tice, co-chairman of Leave Means Leave said: “For the President of the EU Commission to make these disparaging comments before negotiations have started is completely inappropriate as well as being illegal according to the wording of Article 50 . \n“It seems clear that he is determined to pursue a spiteful campaign against Britain, which will impact negatively on the citizens of the EU he claims to represent.” \nHe added: “No deal is better than a bad deal and if the EU is adamant about offering us such a bad deal, the PM should walk away at the earliest opportunity. \n“Adopting World Trade Organisation rules is a perfectly acceptable way for Britain to proceed, it is what we do with most of the rest of the world anyway.” GETTY David Davies slammed Mr Juncker for making 'empty threats' \nResponding to Mr Juncker's comments, Mrs May's official spokesman said: \"We have said many times we are at the start of negotiations and let's see how it unfolds.\" \nMr Barnier indicated that he was preparing for the possibility that Brexit will mean tighter controls at borders with the UK. \nAs he held a technical seminar with member states to discuss the impact on customs controls and procedures, the Commission negotiator said: \"EU27 have to start preparing now for future controls.\" \nMrs May's spokesman responded: \"The PM has made clear that our aim in this negotiation is to secure frictionless borders and that's what we are seeking to achieve.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:16:35.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
