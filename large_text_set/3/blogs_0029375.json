John Jaso doubled and scored on Alec Sole's misplay at third base in the first inning. With two on and two outs in the fourth, Stewart hit a clean single to center field. Rays outfielder Mallex Smith 's throw sailed wide of the plate, two runs scored and Stewart wheeled around to third base after giving the Bucs a 3-0 lead. Stewart's RBI single, two score TB@PIT: Two runs score on Stewart's single and error Chris Stewart lines an RBI single to center field, scoring David Freese and Phil Gosselin scores on a throwing error Full Game Coverage \nRight-hander Trevor Williams , competing for the final spot in the Pirates' rotation, put together a dominant performance. Williams held the Rays scoreless for five innings, allowing three hits while striking out four and inducing six ground-ball outs. He was followed by most of the Pirates' \"A\" bullpen -- closer Tony Watson and setup men Daniel Hudson , Felipe Rivero and Juan Nicasio -- in the combined four-hit, one-walk shutout. \nErasmo Ramirez started for the Rays and allowed one earned run on four hits and a walk while striking out four. Six of his other outs were groundouts, which bodes well for the right-hander, who looks to again be part of the Rays' bullpen in 2017. Ramirez's 1st-inning strikeout TB@PIT: Ramirez gets Bell swinging Erasmo Ramirez retires Josh Bell on a swinging strikeout in the 1st inning \n\"[Getting ground balls] means I was working down in the strike zone,\" Ramirez said. \"Making the hitters hit ground balls, that means a lot to a pitcher. That's way better because, you know, the Trop is a fly ball park. Can mean a lot of home runs. The more you get the ball on the ground, the more chances you'll have to succeed at Tropicana Field.\" \nRays Up Next: The Rays will host the Red Sox on Saturday afternoon in a 1:05 p.m. ET contest at Charlotte Sports Park. Blake Snell will start and he'll be followed by Tommy Hunter and Justin Marks . Snell, who is penciled in to be the Rays' No. 4 starter, has had a tough spring, going 2-1 with a 5.65 ERA, including eight walks in 14 1/3 innings. Rays manager Kevin Cash noted that the left-hander needed to \"flip a switch a little bit\" to be ready for the season. Shawn Haviland will start for the Red Sox. Watch the game live on MLB.TV . \nPirates Up Next: Top prospect Tyler Glasnow , making one of his final bids for the last spot in Pittsburgh's rotation, will start for the Pirates as they host the Tigers at LECOM Park at 1:05 p.m. on Saturday. Left-hander Steven Brault , competing for the same job, is slated to pitch after Glasnow. Reliever Jared Hughes is also scheduled to take the mound for the Bucs.
