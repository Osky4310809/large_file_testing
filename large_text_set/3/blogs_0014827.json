Nigerian Police \nThe incident, which occurred between Ekwoma and Umunede, along the Benin/Asaba/Onitsha expressway, led to a serious manhunt for the abductors. \nThe unsuspecting Police Officer was abducted at about 4pm on Sunday, March 5, 2017, on his way to Asaba after spending the weekend with his family at Agbor. \nA reliable source who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Sunday Vanguard that the decomposing corpse of the DPO was found in Umunede bush yesterday. \nHe disclosed that one of the suspected kidnappers, a Fulani who sells water Mellon at Abraka within Asaba metropolis, has been arrested. \nSome time ago, the decomposing body of the king of Ubulu-Uku, HRM Edward Akaeze Ofulue III, who was kidnapped by suspected Fulani herdsmen in January, 2016, was also found in Umunede bush days after his abduction. \nContacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Mr Andrew Aniamaka, confirmed the development. The PPRO, who was obviously sad, did not give further details on the matter.
