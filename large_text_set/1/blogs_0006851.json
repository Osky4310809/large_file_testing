Consumers are increasingly opting to stay home and drink instead of hitting up bars and clubs.\nThe market for such a device also remains relatively clear of any major competition beyond a few scattered crowd-funding efforts.\nBONUS: Tech wiz builds a bionic hand out of a coffee maker", "external_links": ["http://www.fooddive.com/news/why-campbell-discontinued-its-k-cup-soups-line/419401/", "https://www.whitehutchinson.com/news/lenews/2016_may/article104.shtml", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/L9mDh1Q8.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/L9mDh1Q8.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-07T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:57:53.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
