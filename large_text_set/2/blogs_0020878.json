Elwell, who had a blood alcohol content of 0.175 at the time, more than twice the legal limit, was speeding when his BMW crashed into Javadi’s Lexus, sending her into a metal pole. She died about an hour later, the Dallas Morning News reports .\nAs part of plea deal arranged by Javadi’s parents and prosecutors, Elwell will also serve one week in jail on the anniversary of Javadi’s death on Feb. 10, 2015, for the next nine years, WFAA reports .\n“That was the only thing that was important to us,” Javadi’s father, Michael, told the station Thursday. “That there needs to be some sort of accountability for the irresponsible actions that he took.”\nThe Javadis said they were never interested in seeing Elwell locked up for life, but rather acting on advice given to them by their attorneys that drunk drivers convicted of intoxication manslaughter often receive probation instead of years behind bars.\n“We’re not going back to look at the negative, she was not a negative person,” Javadi’s mother, Karen, told the station. “And we made it. We’re going to make this.”\nAttorney Nicole Knox, who was not associated to the case, said she often works on similar prosecutions and said the punishment was unique.\n“To have that annual reminder and the purpose of the annual reminder, while you’re sitting in solitude incarcerated, I think it’s a really creative way to create more of a deterrent effect,” Knox told WFAA.\nAs part of his probation, Elwell will not be allowed to drink alcohol, must attend Alcohol Anonymous meetings and speak at drunken driving support groups.\nThe terms of Elwell’s probation keeps his punishment from being too lenient, according to Karen Javadi, who said a longer sentence would have negatively impacted his child.\n“Our justice system allows people to walk with probation only,” she told the Dallas Morning News. “We can’t change the justice system overnight … I hope he turns around his life and becomes a better person.”\nMore than 1,000 people attended Javadi’s memorial service at the Granada Theater and her memory lives on through the Emily Javadi Foundation, which gives scholarships to people looking to fulfill their fitness or entrepreneurial potential, according to its website .\n“Though tragically taken from the world in February of 2015 by a drunk driver, Emily’s story — her spirit, her love, and her light — is not defined by the way her physical life ended so suddenly,” the website reads. “Instead, her story is defined by the people whose lives have been forever touched by having known her.”\nFriends of Javadi’s told the Dallas Morning News that the former supply chain analyst at the Baylor Health Care System was caring and creative, someone who looked out for others and often found people safer options to get home if they were inebriated.\n“She was extraordinary simply by being ordinary, by being just the most extraordinary ordinary person ever,” Mark Landson said. “She didn’t have special talents, her talent was being nice and being thoughtful. That was her special talent. She touched thousands of people’s lives in that way just by doing that.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:42:48.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
