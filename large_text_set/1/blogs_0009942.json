AP File Photo \nMANILA — The first visit of a head of state during his term was a “welcome and much awaited reunion,” President Duterte said as he feted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Malacañang, barely three months after his own state visit to Tokyo. \nAt the state banquet for the Prime Minister on Thursday (Jan. 12), Mr. Duterte underscored the close relations between the Philippines and Japan, and said his discussions with Abe moved their countries closer to their common goals of ensuring a stable and more secure environment for their nations and their people to grow. \n“Prime Minister Abe’s presence in Manila today is proof positive that Japan and the Philippines are fully committed to bring this long standing friendship and tried and tested partnership to even greater heights,” Mr. Duterte said.
