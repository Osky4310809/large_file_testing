William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., told reporters that his staff met Monday with members of the Capitol Police to press theft charges against Hunter, who yanked the painting Friday and delivered it to Clay’s office.\n“He had no right to take that picture down,” Clay said. “It’s thievery.”\nAccording to Kerry Picket of the Daily Caller, Clay said the police \"have not been helpful to the congressman in his quest to file charges against Hunter.\"\nA source on the hill familiar with the matter claims that Clay “asked for law enforcement protection to be present when he puts the painting back up at 10 a.m.\nHowever, Clay denied he asked law enforcement for protection when asked by The Daily Caller about it.\n“Why would I ask for police protection? I’m from St. Louis. I don’t need police protection. I don’t’ need that. For what? I do what I need to do. I’m a member of Congress. So how dare you ask me that. Why do I need police protection?” Clay snapped back.\nAccording to the Caller, Hunter’s top aide brushed off Clay’s threats of prosecution:\n“We’re less than zero percent worried about this, because, one, it’s not theft when you take something off a wall, without damaging the property, in the Capitol Building and return it to its rightful owner on behalf of a student in any way what so ever,” a Hunter spokesman told TheDC.\n“We conferred with counsel on this and their response to us was, ‘give us a break.’ The Capitol Hill Police will be responsible for investigating it. There’s nothing to investigate other than the fact that Hunter screwed it off the wall and returned it to its rightful owner for the purpose of ‘safekeeping.’”\nClay doesn’t know if the ethics committee “would even consider an ethics complaint. I want to file a criminal charge for theft. Look, this kid won a contest. His painting was placed there with the 400 others so why should he be singled out and taken down by a member.”\nHowever, he would like to see other pieces removed from the Capitol that he finds offensive.\n“There’s plenty of art work in this capitol that I find to be very offensive and we should remove it—like Jefferson Davis’ statue—like Robert E. Lee—two traitors who caused America 600,000 lives and they’re treasonous. They should be out of here or Nathan Forrest—the founder of the KKK. His ass shouldn’t be hanging around here,” he said.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/09/democrat-wants-criminal-charges-against-gop-rep-duncan-hunter-for-removing-offensive-anti-cop-painting/\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/09/mo-congressman-wants-fellow-lawmaker-charged-with-theft-over-student-paintings-removal/?outputType=accessibility&nid=menu_nav_accessibilityforscreenreader", "http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/09/rep-clay-attempts-to-file-charges-over-removal-of-painting-depicting-cops-as-pigs/"], "published": "2017-01-10T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T12:13:17.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
