Lucky for you, we have some tools to make the command line less intimidating to newcomers that also help old timers remember what to do in a number of common circumstances. Homebrew Makes Installing Apps on Mac Way Easier GIF \nHomebrew is a package installer for Mac that makes it easy to download and install apps right from the command line. You’ll also need it to install some of the tools we discuss below. Advertisement \nWe’ve talked about using Homebrew as a bulk app installer before , so we won’t go into it a ton here, but the basic idea is to streamline installing any apps you need. Type in a command, like brew install appname and Homebrew downloads and installs it. \nWith Homebrew, you can also create an installer script using a tool called Homebrew Cask that installs all your favorite apps on a new computer in a matter of minutes with a single command. The worst part about setting up a new Mac is finding and downloading all your software.

Previously mentioned , Mac-CLI and Climate are both tools that simplify some of the most common commands by turning them into normal human language. Climate is made for Linux, while Mac-CLI is made for the Mac. Both do essentially the same thing, with different commands. Climate requires the Climate command. Mac-CLI requires the Mac command. Advertisement \nHere are a few of our favorite from Mac-CLI to give you an idea of what you can do with them: mac update : Installs software updates, Ruby gems, Homebrew updates, npm updates, and more. mac find : biggest-files: Searches and displays the biggest files inside the current directory. mac system : Show system information to review performance. mac xcode:cleanup : Cleans up Xcode files. mac git:branch : Show all Git branches mac dev:optimize-images : Optimize all images in the current directory for the web. \nClimate works similarly, but with Linux-specific tools: Advertisement climate update : Updates your climate install. climate find biggest-files : Searches and displays the biggest files inside the current directory. climate overview : Displays a performance overview of our system. climate list-branches : Displays a list of all your Git branches. \nThat should give you an idea of what to expect here. Check out the full list of all commands over on the Mac-CLI and Climate GitHub pages. The basic idea of both is to make the command line a little less intimidating for beginners by standardizing commands, but it’s really just as useful for experienced users who can’t remember the commands they don’t use very often. Mac-CLI isn’t your only option here for Mac, m-cli is basically the same, but doesn’t require the same third-party dependencies. It’s not quite as robust a toolkit, but still worth a look if you’re curious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T20:17:13.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
