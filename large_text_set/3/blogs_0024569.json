We did.” \nPisanski and other researchers created an application and cover letter for a fake scientist, complete with a resume full of phony degrees non-existent book chapters. Many of the journals Pisanski and his colleagues examined accept cash in return for publishing scientific research. \nScientists are under huge financial pressure to publish research as their career evaluations look at how frequently they get work published in a journal. \nScientists also have a huge incentive to tweak, or outright fake, statistical analyses to make results appear to significantly validate their political goals. A growing number of scientists have noticed the wave of retractions , especially among social scientists. \nOne study found that 34 percent of researchers self-report they have engaged in “questionable research practices,” including “dropping data points on a gut feeling” and “changing the design, methodology, and results of a study in response to pressures from a funding source.” Seventy-two percent of those surveyed knew of colleagues who had done so. \nThe National Science Foundation estimates such misconduct costs more than $110 million every year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:08:04.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
