The Eagles are back in the tournament this year, and yes, they still dunk. But there’s something even more notable about FGCU this season than dunks.\nI mean, look at this damn free throw:\nThis is Demetris Morant , the team’s starting big man and third leading scorer. He shoots free throws the way you would shoot a very heavy pumpkin, but it kind of works for him.\nMorant shot only 47 percent from the line last year. This season? He’s up to 63.4 percent. That’s, like, almost respectable.\nThis isn’t the most notable free throw form of the tournament, because Florida’s Canyon Barry has that market covered . Still: pretty weird. And great. Whatever works for you, Demetris. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T04:45:38.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
