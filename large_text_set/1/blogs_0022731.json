The airline will operate a wide-body Boeing 777-300ER on the route, offering eight seats in first, 42 in business and 304 in economy class, as well as 19 tonnes of belly-hold cargo capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\"We are pleased to be able to help meet a strong consumer need long neglected by other airlines, and we would like to thank the authorities and our partners in both the US and Greece for their support of the new route,\" said Sir Tim Clark, the president of Emirates Airline.\n\"We also expect tourism to receive a major boost from the availability of daily flights year-round.\"\nElena Kountoura, the minister of tourism of the Hellenic Republic said: \"This strategic choice substantially supports our efforts at the ministry of tourism to enhance the already increasing flow of visitors to Greece from the United States and the UAE on a yearly basis, travelling either for leisure or business purposes.\"\nIn addition, the expected increase in tourism numbers will provide a boost for Greece’s battered economy, still wrangling with the IMF over the next tranche of its bailout. \n\"Greece’s economic comeback is going to have to include year round tourism and easier business travel. The new Emirates route makes this possible,\" said Endy Zemenides, the executive director of the Hellenic American Leadership Council. \nThe US is home to the largest overseas Greek community in the world, numbering approximately 1.3 million, and the New York City metropolitan area has the largest community of Greek Americans in the country, according to Emirates. \nEmirates operates one of the youngest and most modern fleets in the sky, with an average fleet age of just 61 months, compared to the industry average of 140 months. \nEmirates flight EK209 will depart Dubai at 10:50 local time, arriving in Athens at 14:25 before departing again at 16:40 and arriving into Newark at 22:00 on the same day. The return flight EK210 will depart Newark at 23:45 local time, arriving in Athens the next day at 15:05. EK210 will depart once again from Athens at 17:10 bound for Dubai where it will arrive at 23:50.\n\ncnelson@thenational.ae \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T14:44:27.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
