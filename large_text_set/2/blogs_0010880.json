He describes the little room he’d retreat to backstage before a performance, where he’d hide away, sizing up the audience. \n“All that famous partying had to wait till afterwards. Those extravagant feasts that rumour had it the Stones demanded backstage: caviar, vintage champagne, stuffed quails… they never ate any of it. \n“They took their shows far too seriously for that. He had carbs for an early lunch. Then water, maybe eight pints, because he’d lose 10 pints on stage.” \nB ut despite Mr Blake portraying a less rock and roll Sir Mick , other revelations in the manuscript reveal how the star purchased his home while on drugs and the “tedium” of looking at Keith Richard’s “scraggy, monkey-like bottom night after night”. Profile | Mick Jagger \nM r Blake adds: “Mick tells of buying a historic mansion, Stargroves, while high on acid and of trying out the life of horse-riding country squire. \n“Having never ridden a horse before, he leapt on to a stallion, whereupon it reared and roared off ‘like a Ferrari’. \n“He gave the stallion a thump on the forehead right between the eyes and slowed it down — otherwise the Stones’ story might have ended differently.” \nMr Blake added: “[Mick] has said again and again, in countless interviews, that he never will [write an autobiography]. Except what virtually nobody knows is that he already has. \n“It is an extraordinary insight into one of the three most influential rock stars of all time – but the sad thing is, the public will probably never see it.” \nA spokesperson for Sir Mick said Mr Blake has not been in contact with the singer and was unable to comment on any specific incidents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:16:07.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
