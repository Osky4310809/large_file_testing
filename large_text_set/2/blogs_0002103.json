That was also the year when Trump received a letter from Richard Nixon predicting he would “be a winner” whenever he ran for office. \nIn fact, the same month Gorsuch and his fellow students were joking about Trump running for office, the real estate mogul made a visit to New Hampshire at the behest of local organizers who wanted him to run for president. \nThe appearance followed a September 1987 op-ed that appeared in The New York Times and several other newspapers in which Trump staked out some positions that sound familiar almost 30 years later. \n“For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States,” Trump wrote. \n“The world is laughing at American politicians as we protect ships we don’t own, carrying oil we don’t need, destined for allies who won’t help,” he continued. \n“Make Japan, Saudi Arabia, and others pay for the protection we extend our allies,” he added. \n“Let’s help our farmers, our sick, our homeless by taking from some of the greatest profit machines ever created — machines created and nurtured by us. ‘Tax’ these wealthy nations, not America. End our huge deficits, reduce our taxes, and let America’s economy grow unencumbered by the cost of defending those who can easily afford to pay us for the defense of their freedom. Let’s not let our great country be laughed at anymore,” Trump wrote then. \nAlthough Trump said he had no intention of running, he did make a comment to The New York Times about his chances. \n“I believe that if I did run for president, I’d win,” he said in October 1987.
