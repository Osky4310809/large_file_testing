That hasn’t stopped one report out of Korea that claims the Galaxy S8 will go on sale worldwide on Friday, April 21st , but little pre-order information has surfaced until now. \nA new report says that Galaxy S8 pre-orders will commence on April 10th, nearly two weeks after the announcement and approximately a week and a half before worldwide sales get off the ground (a few days earlier than the April 15th date rumored several weeks ago). \nThe Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, according to a leaked spec sheet , are said to feature 5.8 and 6.2-inch Infinity Displays, respectively, thanks to a brand new trademark application , either Qualcomm’s octa-core Snapdragon 835 or Samsung’s homegrown Exynos 8895 SoC, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of base storage with the coveted microSD card slot for expandable storage, 8MP front/12MP Dual Pixel rear camera combo, iris camera/scanner, and either a 3,250mAh (S8) or 3,750mAh (S8+) battery , depending on model with Android 7.0 pre-installed. Samsung intends to bring the Tab S3′s new AKG audio to its Galaxy smartphone lineup , and the Galaxy S8 will be the first to offer AKG earphones in the box. \nOn the software front, buyers will get on-screen software navigation buttons this year that may be customizable , and proper PC-like functionality by way of Samsung’s upcoming Desktop eXperience that’ll connect to and work well with an external monitor. There’s still that Beast Mode that could showcase the next Galaxy’s sheer, raw performance at a moment’s notice. Samsung has already started updating its proprietary apps to reflect the new UI of the next “Galaxy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T05:45:28.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
