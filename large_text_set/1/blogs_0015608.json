They’re massive sea predators who generally scare the bejeezus out of us. However, we have nothing but complete respect and admiration for this diver who cuddles with the same shark , and has been doing so for the past seven years.\nIf someone posted an ad reading “ kitten snugglers wanted,” we’d say sign us up right away. But since not even a cage could keep a shark from trying to make a meal out of us, we’ll gladly sit back from a safe distance on land, and allow this most unexpected friendship between man and sea beast to proceed without judgment.\nAfter all, Rick Anderson is a professional who runs his own dive school, and animals are pretty irresistible, so we can kind of understand him developing a connection with a female Port Jackson shark — kind of.\nBut honestly this still scares us a little:\n& Posted by Ricks Dive School on  Wednesday, January 11, 2017 As Anderson explained to The Dodo :\n“I started playing with her about seven years ago when she was just a pup about 6 inches long.” He added, “I approached her carefully so as not to spook her, then began to gently pat her. Once she got used to me, I would cradle her in my hand and talk soothingly to her through my regulator.” \nBut that was only the beginning of Anderson and the shark’s relationship:\n“Over the following seasons, she’d recognize me and would swim up to me for a pat and cuddle. She soon got used to me — to the point where she will swim up to me when I’m going past, and tap me on the legs until I hold my arms out for her to lay on for a cuddle.” “Most divers seeing this for the first time can’t believe it,” Anderson added. “I don’t feed her or any of the other sharks I play with — I basically treat them like I would a dog.”\nUm, yeah. This is extremely cute, but we think we’ll stick to cuddling furry, four-legged creatures who don’t have fins and an appetite for blood.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T07:03:30.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
