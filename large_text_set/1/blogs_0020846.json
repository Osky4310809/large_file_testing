(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) \nPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign orders later this week restricting the flow of refugees into the United States. The current proposal includes at least a four-month halt on all refugee admissions, as well as a temporary ban on people coming from some Muslim-majority countries, based on a draft of the executive order. \nThe mandate would come after Trump on Wednesday signed executive orders to begin the process to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and to block federal grants from \"sanctuary cities\" that protect immigrants in the country illegally. St. Louis is not such a city. \nStephen Legomsky, who took a leave of absence as a law professor at Washington University to serve as chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Obama administration, said Trump has the legal authority to suspend the refugee resettlement program \"but it is a terrible idea. The needs of the refugees who they are blocking are so desperate. The U.S. is uniquely positioned to be generous. In our history, we have been so focused on the admission of refugees, this seems regrettable.\" \nLegomsky said the thrust of the executive order regarding refugees seems to be that the current procedures are not rigorous enough. \n\"The vetting process that already occurs contains multiple safeguards,\" Legomsky said. They include multiple interviews, review of paperwork by law enforcement and intelligent agencies in the U.S. and abroad, he said. \n\"All of these things are done over a period of one to two years before the person sets foot on American soil,\" he said. \"Then at the point of entry, they are vetted again. The ironic part of it is the (Trump) administration has yet to identify a single thing that could be added to the vetting process that the previous administration was not doing. The whole exercise seems pointless to me.\" \nLegomsky said \"no competent terrorist\" would ever select the U.S. refugee resettlement program as the preferred route to gain access to the country, considering that 50 million people a year come to the U.S. as tourists. According to the State Department, which oversees the program, 3 million refugees have been accepted into the U.S since 1975, living in all 50 states. \nAnna Crosslin, CEO and president of the International Institute St. Louis, the region's largest refugee resettlement agency, said suspending the program will only amplify the fear that some refugees living here have, as loved ones who are in the resettlement program will be stuck in limbo for at least four months. \nSome of those relatives are in need of medical care, she said. \n\"The halt of the program for 120 days could in fact be the difference between life and death,\" Crosslin said. \nIn the 2016 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the institute resettled 1,142 refugees, a jump of about 400 people over previous years. That was due largely to the Obama administration increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country to assist Syrians fleeing civil war. \nCrosslin said suspending the program could also affect those the institute already serves, providing job training and English classes among other services. The institute gets about $2,000 per refugee from the federal government. About half of that goes to the refugee for housing, food and utilities; the institute keeps the rest to provide services, which includes paying staff. With fewer dollars coming in, some programs could be cut, she said, \nOn a larger scale, Crosslin said, preventing refugees from entering the country can jeopardize the alliances the U.S. and its military has built around the country in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan where locals help build roads, drive soldiers, and to provide interpretation and medical care. \n\"We have to be able to rely on the support of the local people. They are taking tremendous chances and if refugees are rejected from admission to the United States, how do our Armed Forces convince individuals to fight with us when they can't guarantee that if something happens and the war goes south, they would be protected and removed? Who is going to fight with us in these circumstances?\" \nCrosslin said those who work with refugees are urging the Trump administration to keep the program moving while they review it. \n\"Beginning today the United States of America gets back control of its borders,\" Trump declared Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:53:21.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
