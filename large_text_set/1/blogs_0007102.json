Close share panel First Minister Carwyn Jones says Wales needs \"full and unfettered access\" to the European single market, as he flies to Norway to learn more about its relationship with the EU. \nThe three-day visit comes as UK ministers prepare the way for Brexit negotiations. \nAlthough not an EU member, Norway pays into the EU budget in return for full access to the European single market . \nIt also accepts most EU laws and allows EU citizens to live and work there. \nMr Jones said keeping Wales' \"full and unfettered\" access to the single market after Brexit was his top priority. \nNorway is exempt from EU rules on agriculture, fisheries, justice and home affairs but has no say over how the rules of the single market are created. Carwyn Jones: Brexit will need immigration compromise \nSpeaking before leaving Cardiff, Mr Jones said he would spend the next three days meeting Norwegian firms and ministers responsible for trade and relations with the EU. \n\"The UK is Norway's largest export market, accounting for 20% of the country's exports, while 80% of their total exports remain within the EU due to their access to the single market,\" he said. \nMr Jones said Wales \"first and foremost\" needed \"continued full and unfettered access to the European single market\". \n\"Wales has attracted investment from hundreds of international companies on the basis of access to the single market,\" he said. \n\"Failure to maintain full access, free of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade post-Brexit could make sustaining and securing investment more difficult.\" \nIn November , the first minister told AMs that maintaining access to Europe's single market without extra costs was a more important issue than immigration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T09:06:31.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
