On Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) made it somewhat magical by completely owning the website Deadspin in just two tweets. \nLet's present this as act in four parts: \nAct I: Sports website Deadspin attempts to embarrass Ted Cruz on Monday afternoon. Send us proof of Ted Cruz playing basketball https://t.co/MgGLnsscPf pic.twitter.com/mpxI5EBQkK — Deadspin (@Deadspin) January 23, 2017 \nApparently, Cruz has set up a basketball game with his Republican Senate colleagues, which I'll admit is an extremely funny mental image. Deadspin wants proof of this, in a similar manner to how they bizarrely accused Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) of lying about his high school football career back in 2014. \nAct II: Ted Cruz comes in with a zinger. — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 25, 2017 \nCruz replied with a picture of Grayson Allen, a junior guard at Duke University. The resemblance between the two has been documented for the entirety of Allen's time at Duke. \nAct III: Deadspin realizes they've been defeated. @tedcruz Go eat shit. \nAh, a mature, measured response. \nAct IV: Cruz reveals himself as a memelord. — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 25, 2017 *Mic drop.*", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:47:00.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
