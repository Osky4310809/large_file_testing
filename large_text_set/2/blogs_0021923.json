Lot and lots of politics . \nWhich left many hoping designers and major labels would strut-the-strut and cast significantly more models of color, immigrants, plus-size models, in-between size models, transgender models and all other measures of diversity and inclusivity. \nAccording to a new study released by theFashionSpot, an online community of fashion insiders that's been tracking diversity in the industry, there were a few steps in the right direction. \nEvery major runway had at least one model of color, a first since the group began analyzing the shows six seasons ago. \n\"There's some good news coming out of our latest NYFW diversity report,\" says editor-in-chief Jennifer Davidson. \"At least one woman of color appeared in each of the 116 major runway shows we examined â€” a first for any of the four major fashion cities (New York, London, Milan and Paris).\" \nA plus-size model presents a creation by Christian Siriano. (Photo: PETER FOLEY, EPA) \nJacobs was one of the standouts, one season after he caused an uproar by featuring models in faux-dreadlocks . The fashion week veteran cast nearly 10% more models of color than he had one year prior. \nKanye West, who similarly ruffled feathers with a casting call for \"multiracial women only\" in September, had one of the most diverse shows. He cast hijab-wearing model Halima Aden , who was born in a refugee camp in Kenya and made headlines for competing in a hijab at her state's Miss USA pageant last year. \nOverall, castings of non-white models hit 31.5%, a slight increase from last season. Six of the top 10 models who walked in the most shows were women of color, and of various origins, from Jamaica to Nigeria and China. \nBody-inclusivity advocates also saw a rise. Women above a sample size appeared in big-name shows including Siriano, Prabal Gurung and Michael Kors, a first for the designer who has been showing at fashion week for more than thirty years. New York Fashion Week inches toward inclusivity, but more progress is needed \n26 plus-size models walked in nine shows, a jump from 16 last season, though the number marks only 1% of total model castings. \nThe statistics show clear progress for an industry that has been slow to break its focus on white, thin beauty standards, but the movement is incremental. \n\"True diversity and inclusion of all races, body shapes, ages and gender identities still comes down to just a handful of designers,\" Davidson says. \"The results in our report are encouraging, but there's still a lot of work to be done.\" Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:14:39.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
