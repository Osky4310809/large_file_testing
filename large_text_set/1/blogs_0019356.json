We maintained the service since we joined Facebook in 2009, but the number of people using FriendFeed had been steadily declining and in the end, the community was just a fraction of what it once was. Given this, we decided that it was time to start winding things down. We want to thank you all for being such a terrific and enthusiastic community. We're proud of what we built so many years ago, and we recognize that it would have never been possible without your support. - The FriendFeed team", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:17:04.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
