They abandoned her to the night. \n\"Had vigilant door security or Guardians not been there for 'Sarah' any number of negative situations could have occurred such was her level of intoxication.\" \nCheltenham Guardians said it learned that 'Sarah' was staying with a friend - named as 'Beth' in the Facebook post, although it is not her real name - who made it into the club.

Sarah - find yourself some new friends. You don't need these lowlives!\" \nBut some suggested that 'Sarah' should take some responsibility for her condition. \nOne user wrote: \"Nobody should get so intoxicated they cannot look after themselves. If she had no money why was she going into a club. \n\"Always easy to keep pointing fingers but at the end of the day it's 18 to drink and your classed as an adult. So be responsible for your own actions.\" \nVolunteers said they have been dealing with an increase in cases where friends are abandoning friends on nights out, often leaving them with no money or way of getting home.
