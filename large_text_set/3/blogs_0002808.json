The end result is that Google Translate works a lot better and offers more accurate translations.\nInitially, NMT was only used to translate English to and from French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Turkish. Now, Google announced that the new technology is coming to Google Translate in many more languages over the next couple of weeks, starting with Hindi, Russian, and Vietnamese.\nSee also: Gboard beta update adds Google Translate integration, improved theme selector, and more 4 days ago NMT will be available on the Android app, at translate.google.com, and through Google Search and the Google app. Apart from the ones listed above, the company did not mention how many and which other languages will get the new technology.\nNMT is a great technology that really improves translations and makes them sound a lot more natural. Without it, Google only translates sentences word by word or by phrases, which means that the translation isn’t always the best and doesn’t even make much sense in certain scenarios.\nThe new system should fix this issue. The best part of it is that it learns over time, so it is constantly getting better and more accurate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:02:49.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
