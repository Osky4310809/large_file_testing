File photo \n  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said monetary and fiscal authorities have ample policy space to respond to external shocks brought about by the growing trend of populism and protectionism in the US and in Europe as well as the divergence of monetary policy. \nBSP Governor Amando Tetangco Jr. said the gross domestic product (GDP) growth target of 6.5 to 7.5 percent this year is achievable despite the continuing external headwinds. \n“Our thrust over the years has been to focus on ensuring sound macroeconomic fundamentals and building these as sole growth of resilience. Such focus has yielded considerable gains for us,” he said in a speech during the 5th Asean-EU Business Summit. \nThe country’s GDP growth accelerated to 6.8 percent last year from 5.9 percent in 2015 on the back of robust domestic demand and higher investment growth. \nThe strong growth was achieved amid a benign inflation environment as the consumer price index averaged 1.8 percent, below the BSP’s two to four percent target. \n“We have registered 72 consecutive quarters of uninterrupted GDP growth propelled by broad based economic drivers like a well managed inflation environment, sound external sector dynamics and a stable budget system,” he said.   \nInflation averaged three percent in the first two months of the year despite kicking up to a 27-month high of 3.3 percent in February from 2.7 percent in January. \n“This environment gives us a sound basis to be optimistic about the Philippine economic outlook. We believe that the economy can attain its GDP growth target of 6.5 to 7.5 percent this year and remain a source of strength for the Asean region,” Tetangco said. \nThe BSP chief, however, warned about the growing tendency towards protectionism and populism with the Brexit as well as the potential shift in policies under the administration of US President Donald Trump. \n“If these inward-oriented sentiments continue to gain traction, this will undermine cooperation and potentially shrink global trade. This could in turn derail the global economy’s already protracted path to recovery,” he said. \nHe also cited the monetary policy divergence as other central banks in advanced economies continued to remain accommodative while the US Fed continues to tighten its policy stance through a series of rate increases. \nHe pointed out the divergence could result in volatility in financial markets and possibly dampen credit activities in the near term and growth in the longer term. \nThe BSP chief reiterated the country’s strong macroeconomic fundamentals would serve as the “spring of resilience” amidst the external headwinds. \n“Both our fiscal and monetary sectors also have ample policy space to respond to the materialization of external shocks. We have to accelerate government spending to build needed infrastructure, generate jobs and support economic growth,” Tetangco said. \nLikewise, he said monetary authorities have the flexibility to adjust policy as needed to sustain price and financial stability without sacrificing economic activity. \nHe said stronger economic relations abound between ASEAN and EU particularly in the areas of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), digital economy, and human resource development.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:10:04.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
