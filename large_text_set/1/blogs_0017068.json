But his answer was blunt, and directed at his goalkeeper. \n“That [the travel] had nothing to do with it. That doesn’t stop you from setting the wall up properly.” \nFormer Socceroos goalkeeper Mark Bosnich also questioned the positioning of Thomas’s wall. \n“When you get a free kick in the centre of the goal, especially one that’s close to the box, that wall was pretty much in the centre,” he said on Matchday Saturday. “When it’s a right footer you [should] set the wall up on the goalkeeper’s side so they have to go over the wall. If it’s a left footer, you set it up on the other side. \n“You can’t put it in the centre.” Petratos worldie, every angle 0:48 \nSydney FC goalkeeper coach John Crawley came to the defence of Thomas, but Mark Rudan revealed the decision of the positioning of the wall was squarely on the 24-year-old. \n“That’s two in two weeks now,” he said. “Take nothing away from the Petratos goal – a superb strike – but we did question the wall. \n“So I got in touch with JP [de Marigny, the Melbourne Victory assistant coach] and asked him who’s decision is it to set up the wall. @TheRealBozza .. re the wall. Behind the ball there's a left footer, right footer & a third player? GK sets the wall on any side. #PERvMVC — John Crawley (@crawlj) January 21, 2017 \n“Do you do it at training and it is based on where the free kick is from? Or is it something the goalkeeper, Lawrence Thomas, sets up himself. \n“The response I got was that it was Lawrence’s job to put as many in the wall he wants and position them the way he wants as well. He’s a fine keeper but that’s a deficiency in his game.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
