He was 91-years-old. \n\"We're saddened today to announce the passing of our dear old dad, Warren Frost,\" his son Mark said in a statement. \"From the Normandy shores on D-Day to his 50-year career on stage and screen, he remained the same humble guy from Vermont who taught us that a life devoted to telling the right kind of truths can make a real difference in the lives of others. We're grateful to have shared him with the world for as long as we did.\" \nAfter the Vermont-native moved to Los Angeles in 1958, Frost started off his professional acting career by making guest appearances on TV shows like Perry Mason and Dragnet , as well as landing supporting roles in feature films like The Mating Game, It Started with a Kiss, and Slaughterhouse-Five . \nMost will remember him best for playing Doc Hayward on David Lynch's Twin Peaks , appearing in thirty episodes of the original ABC television series. Frost actually came out of retirement recently to reprise the role in Showtime’s upcoming revival. \nEven if Twin Peaks wasn't your cup of coffee, you will surely recognize Frost for portraying the surly Mr. Ross — the bisexual father of George Costanza’s (deceased) fiancée, Susan — in five episodes of Seinfeld .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:12:11.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
