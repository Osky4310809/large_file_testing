Gen. Michael Flynn (Ret.), tweeted the following on Friday morning: Is anyone surprised the Mike Flynn #fakenews came out A DAY AFTER the @EvelynNFarkas bombshell….??? \n— Michael Flynn Jr🇺🇸 (@mflynnJR) March 31, 2017 \nThat’s a bit curious since his father’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, made it fairly clear on Thursday that the elder Flynn is seeking considerations for any testimony he may give. Just look at the key lines from the attorney letter: “General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.” “He is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated. No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution.” \nTo make matters even more strange, Flynn the retweeted the attorney’s letter: \nHe also retweeted the letter Thursday night.
