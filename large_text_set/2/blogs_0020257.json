Stretch of Roman road unveiled beneath McDonald's restaurant The stretch of ancient road was discovered south of Rome during excavation work for a new McDonald's restaurant. Credit: Mauro Consilvio Nick Squires , Rome  20pm \nT wo thousand years after legionaries tramped along its well-worn paving stones, an exceptionally well-preserved stretch of Roman road has been opened to the public – beneath a McDonald’s restaurant. \nIn what the American burger chain says is its first museum-cum-restaurant anywhere in the world, the 150ft-long stretch of basalt road has been cleared, cleaned and made into a permanent attraction at Frattocchie, south of Rome. \nCustomers in search of a little cultural heritage along with their Big Macs and fries can descend underground and view the Roman road, as well as three ancient skeletons that were found buried in the culverts either side of it. \nA transparent pavement means they can even peer down into the archaeological area while slurping milk shakes and munching McNuggets. A sign outside the new McDonald's outlet points visitors to the archaeological area in Italian and English.

Archaeologists were summoned and the US fast food chain contributed 300,000 euros to the three-year restoration of the site. \nExperts say the paved road connected with the Appian Way, one of ancient Rome ’s most important thoroughfares, which led from the capital to Brindisi on the Adriatic coast. \nNamed after the Roman official who conceived it, Appius Claudius Caecus, it became known as the “regina viarium” or queen of roads. \n“We think it was a side road that connected the Appian Way to a settlement or maybe an important property such as the villa of a rich noble or an imperial estate,” said Alfonsina Russo, superintendent of archaeology for Rome. \n“Sadly only this section survived – the rest was destroyed. But it’s of great historical importance. The Appian Way was traveled by famous figures such as (the Roman poet) Horace, who recounted his journey from Rome to Brindisi in his Satires.” \nThe stretch of road is about 150ft long and more than 7ft wide. It was built in the 2nd century BC but fell into disuse by the 3rd century AD and remained buried for more than 1,700 years. The bodies are believed to have been buried in the period after the road was abandoned. \n“The skeletons belong to three men, the oldest of whom was aged 35-40,” said Pamela Cerino, an archaeologist who worked on the dig. Visitors can explore the well-preserved stretch of Roman road, which extends for about 150ft. Credit: Mauro Consilvio \nA fourth skeleton was discovered beneath a nearby petrol station. Archaeologists found a coin in the person’s mouth, believed to be an offering to Charon, the ferryman of Roman mythology who carried the dead across the River Styx into Hades. \nSigns in English and Italian explain the history of the road and its discovery. It is accessible from the McDonald’s car park, so visitors do not have to eat in the restaurant to explore the newly-opened site. \n“This is our first museum-restaurant,” said Mario Federico, the head of McDonald’s Italia. “We’ve been able to return a stretch of Roman road to the local community and to the whole of Italy. The project is a good example of how the public and private sectors can collaborate effectively on reclaiming cultural heritage.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:30:08.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
