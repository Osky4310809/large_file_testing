How do you get something that is cute, romantic, non-clich√©d, and is not roses and chocolates? Plus men are not the easiest people to buy gifts for. They do not have a thousand things pinned on their Pinterest board, nor do they believe in dropping hints about the gift that they desire. Getting the perfect gift can be quite a task, and that's precisely why we've put together a gift guide that lets you find just the perfect declaration of love for the boyfriend who seems to need nothing. Date night \nTrust us, this is actually a great idea because you can now plan the kind of date you've always wanted. Take the pressure off him this year, and plan a kick-ass, beautiful date for yourself him. Movie night \nIf he loves spending his Sundays binge watching movies on the Internet, then it's a good idea to gift him an annual movie subscription that'll let him catch up on his favourite classics. Biking glasses \nIf he is a biker, or a cyclist, get him a good pair of sunglasses that he can use all year round and look extra chic too. Winter jacket \nThis is practical (which he will love), and thoughtful (which will make you feel happy). Grab a nice winter jacket for him to flaunt in front of his work buddies. Ice bucket set \nFor all the house parties that you are going to be hosting together, this is the perfect \"On the Rocks\" gift. Autographed sporting merchandise \nIf he loves cricket (which also means he loves Sachin Tendulkar) get him an autographed bat that he'll treasure for life. Racing car rental \nIf you can't afford to gift him a racing car (haha we are just kidding, no one can afford that), gift him a session to rent one for a couple of hours. Or, if he has a cool sports car that he is dying to wiz around in, book a racing track that lets him zoom! Here are a few links to get you started. Yacht ride \nRather than spending the day at a slightly overcrowded restaurant in the city, escape to the sea. Book a yacht ride for two, and celebrate the day with champagne and the sunset in the background. \"All You Can Drink\" session \nYou might not get to do this on the 14th (and honestly this is a bad idea if you are looking for quality time), but book a weekend \"All you can drink\" session for him and let him get a friend along. He'll love you for it.
