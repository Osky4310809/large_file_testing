We've been keeping up with their Snapchat and Instagram updates, and we totally wish we were on vacation, too. The two have just blown their social media popularity out of the park, with one of the coolest renditions of 2016's biggest Instagram trend - the mannequin challenge. \nFilmed in their cabana, at the Burj Al Arab, the video has the duo not only effortlessly hold their poses, but also shift into new ones. Sonam and Rhea can be seen eating, drinking, sleeping, and taking selfies, and it's definitely one of the best celebrity mannequin challenges we have seen, yet.
