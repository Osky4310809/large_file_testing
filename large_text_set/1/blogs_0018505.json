Nintendo's Reggie Fils-Aime confirmed in an interview with Polygon that there would be no new games from Nintendo for its outgoing console.\n\"From a first-party standpoint, there's no new development coming after the launch of the legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,\" he said. \"We really are at the end of life for Wii U.\"\nAs to what happens with online support for existing games, Fils-Aime said support will continue for the foreseeable future. \"From our standpoint, sunsetting is quite some time into the future,\" he said. \"The ongoing activity from an online standpoint on [Mario] Kart and Splatoon is significant. We're going to continue to support that.\"\nElsewhere, Nintendo will carry on supporting the 3DS, with a new Fire Emblem game announced earlier this week.\nNo new Wii U games were in the pipeline, although there is the fuzzy case of Shigeru Miyamoto's own Project Giant Robot - a demo that was shown off at E3 in 2014 alongside Project Guard, which eventually made its way out as Star Fox Guard. Nothing has been seen of Project Giant Robot since its showing in 2014, though it continued to appear on Nintendo's own documents. Miyamoto had stated last March that the decision hadn't yet been made to turn Project Giant Robot into a full game.\nThe last Wii U rolled off the production line last November , ensuring there will be few added to the 13.36 million sold as of last September. Its predecessor, the Wii, sold 101 million units, while the GameCube sold 21 million and the N64 some 32 million.", "external_links": ["http://time.com/4245215/starfox-wii-u/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xogBQnr99hA", "http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/19/14313914/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-last-nintendo-game-for-wii-u", "https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2016/161026_2e.pdf"], "published": "2017-01-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T14:50:25.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
