Hilary Duff has been setting trends left and right. From her workout gear, to her color choices, to her phone cases — we are buying everything she’s selling. Her latest venture out into Los Angeles caught out attention because Duff wore a color we need in our spring wardrobe ASAP. The actress wore a mustard yellow suede motorcycle jacket that makes us so happy we actually need a tissue . Does anyone have one?\nWe usually see mustard in the fall alongside our rusts, oxbloods, and forest greens . But all of a sudden Duff hits us with mustard for spring and we’re like, duh!\nGetty Images / BG005/Bauer-Griffin It’s warm and cheery, just like springtime! It just makes sense! Getty Images / BG015/Bauer-Griffin \nOf course, feel free to work mustard into your spring ensembles however you like. But we’re really digging Duff’s motorcycle jacket. Having a great cropped, lightweight jacket for spring is essential and we think a mustard jacket of your own can do wonders for your warm weather wardrobe.\nCheck out this one from Forever 21 ($44.90). It’s faded mustard faux suede is perfect for someone who loves a pop of color, but leans more toward neutrals. It’s definitely yellow, but the boldness has been semi-washed out.\nForever 21 This fringe number from PrettyLittleThing ($30.63) is bold and beautiful. The faux suede is saturated with that bright mustard color, making this jacket a statement piece.\nPrettyLittleThing From MissGuided we have this faux suede motorcycle jacket ($72) that’s a bit softer than the above option. It has really nice silver hardware and looks great with that ACDC band tee.\nMissGuided And finally, this Minkpink biker jacket from ASOS ($83) falls below the natural waist and has zip up pockets. We love the large lapels on this guy.\nASOS You heard it here first — our new favorite condiment is mustard! Hilary Duff has influenced us with her badass fashion once again, but thank god she did! This is a color that is making our lives a little brighter.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:28:48.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
