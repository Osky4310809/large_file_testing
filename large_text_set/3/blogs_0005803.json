In one email, Pence’s top state homeland security adviser relayed an update from the FBI regarding the arrests of several men on federal terror-related charges. \nCybersecurity experts say the emails raise concerns about whether such sensitive information was adequately protected from hackers, given that personal accounts like Pence’s are typically less secure than government email accounts.In fact, Pence’s personal account was hacked last summer. \nIn response to the story, Pence’s current office responded that Pence “maintained a state email account and a personal email account” as governor. The office further highlighted that Pence was in compliance with Indiana state law and that emails from both accounts are currently being archived. \nWhile Indiana law does allow public officials to use personal email accounts, it is also understood that all emails revolving around public business need to be retained for records. \nThroughout the campaign, Donald Trump used Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while Secretary of State against her on a consistent basis , calling her “guilty a hell” and running attack ads against her, all while rally crowds chanted “lock her up.” \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T04:40:32.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
