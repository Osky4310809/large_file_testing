We've outlined the key points below. 1. Help to buy \nFirst-time buyers can open a help to buy ISA, which gives a 25% government bonus on amounts saved between £1,600 and £12,000 - although this is capped at £3,000. \nIt can be used for any property costing under £250,000 (£450,000 in London) and any mortgage. \nYou can save up to £1,000 in your first month, then up to £200 a month after that. You can choose to pay in less if you want, and it'll still work. \nHelp to buy ISAs are only available to individuals. If you're buying together, you can separately claim the government bonuses on your savings - and then combine the two to form a joint deposit. \nThings to note: \nThe bonus scheme runs until September 2013 - but the deadline to open an account is December 2019. In April 2017, help to buy will relaunch to become the government's lifetime ISA . You'll be able to shift your money across tax-free. \nIf you miss a contribution one month, you can't make up for it in the following month (the cap is £200). \nIf you're buying together, but one of you is already a home owner. The first time buyer can still open an account. \nYou need to get your solicitor to apply for the bonus when you buy a home. Alternatively, you can take the money out at any point, but if you choose this, you won't qualify for the bonus. \nIf you’re saving into a help to buy ISA you can’t save into another cash ISA in the same tax year.
