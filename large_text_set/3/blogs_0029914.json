Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA one-year-old girl has lost her eyesight and most of her hearing following an alleged hammer attack that killed her twin brother. \nSiblings Maria and Gabriel were rushed to hospital after a \"terrible incident\" at their north London home earlier this month. \nLittle Gabriel was tragically pronounced dead, while Maria was said to remain in a critical condition with severe head injuries. \nNow, it has emerged that the little girl has lost her vision and the majority of her hearing following the alleged attack on March 18. \nShe remains in a \"critical but stable condition\", with her loved ones desperately praying that she hasn't been permanently blinded. \nLast week, a man was charged with Gabriel's murder and Maria's attempted murder. The scene in Wilberforce Road, Finsbury Park (Photo: PA) \nSuspect Bidhya Sagar Das, 33, is accused of attacking the innocent toddlers at the flat in Wilberforce Road, Finsbury Park. \nToday, a friend of the twins' mother, Cristinela Datcu, described how the distraught mum remains by her daughter's bedside. \nFlorentina Ilie, from Watford, said: \"We are all praying that little Maria recovers her eyesight and isn’t permanently blinded by the attack. \n“Cristinela sits in hospital with Maria, willing, wishing and praying for her full recovery after surgery, for what are quite daunting head injuries for such a young child.\" \nFlorentina described how Cristinela has to find a new home to rent because she can't return to live in the house where her son died. \nShe said the grieving mum also has Gabriel's funeral to pay for - and needs money to support herself while her little girl recovers. \n“Cristinela is a hard-working ordinary person who has a job in a North London hotel, with the twins and the income the family had, they managed to live a reasonable but by no means luxurious life,\" she said. \n\"Sadly now (although I’m sure she hasn’t had time to even think about it with much more pressing issues on her mind) Cristinela is to be faced with a mountain of expenses for which she has little savings.\" \nShe added: \"Cristinela has been my friend now for six years and I want to do all I can to help.\" \nFlorentina has set up a JustGiving page to raise £10,000 to help pay for Gabriel's funeral and other emergency expenses. \nA post on the page pleads: \"Let's help this lovely lady.\" \nPolice were called to the flat at around 11.10pm on March 18 to reports of two injured children in what is thought to be a \"domestic incident\". \nThe siblings, who are twins, have been named in court documents as Gabriel Bibekdas Sonu and Tusidas Maria Das, known as 'Maria'. \nDas was arrested at 7.15pm the next day in Hackney after a police manhunt. \nHe was subsequently charged with Gabriel's murder and Maria's attempted murder \nDas was remanded into custody. Cristinela, who remains by her toddler daughter's bedside, is pictured with Das \nDetective Chief Inspector Dave Whellams, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said on March 19: \"This is clearly a tragic incident, and our thoughts are with the family of the two young children. \n\"Despite the best efforts of medical professionals a baby boy sadly died in the early hours of this morning. \n\"A baby girl currently remains in a critical condition and is receiving specialist medical care.\" \nHe added: \"I would still like to hear from anyone who may have any information regarding this terrible incident.” \nJustGiving spokesperson Rhys Goode said he hopes the site's community can help to support Maria and her mum. \nMr Goode said: “Everyone was deeply moved by Cristinela’s story and can only imagine the devastation it has caused. \n\"We hope that the JustGiving community are able to help to support Cristinela and Maria in this time of desperate need.” Anyone with information that may assist the police investigation is asked to contact the incident room on 020 8345 3775 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T19:18:50.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
