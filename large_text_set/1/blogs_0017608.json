Usual shambles from FIFA. Liverpool have been unable to get any clarity from the governing body over Matip's eligibility. #LFC — James Pearce (@JamesPearceEcho) January 15, 2017 I think that's what's known as a farcical situation. — Tony Barrett (@TonyBarrett) January 15, 2017 \nKlopp spoke after the 1-1 draw, saying the situation needs to be solved quickly as Liverpool’s fixtures begin to pile up. \n“Our understanding is Joël is retired from international football and we, the club, did everything we had to do to make this clear but until now we could not get the response we need to be 100 per cent sure that he can play,” said Klopp. media_camera Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp shakes hands with Joel Matip. \n“It’s pretty difficult and pretty frustrating, to be honest. He’s been in training for five days and would have been in the squad, 100 per cent, maybe on the pitch today, so I don’t think it’s fair. \n“But we cannot do more and are still waiting on the decision. We could not take the risk. \n“But we need to get an answer as quickly as possible because on Wednesday we have the next game [an FA Cup third-round replay at Plymouth] and then another game and another game. We cannot wait forever. \n“It is public now, we have this problem and we are not the only team with this problem.” \nLiverpool’s official statement read further: “The Cameroon Football Federation have failed to confirm that Matip can ... play club football during the period of the Africa Cup of Nations. \n“Liverpool have subsequently repeatedly sought, as a matter of urgency, clarity from FIFA in this regard. \n“This includes assurances the player was called up for the tournament in accordance with the world governing body’s regulations. \n“It is Liverpool’s view that the player should be available for club football during the period of the competition and will continue to work for a speedy and unambiguous resolution.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T00:42:34.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
