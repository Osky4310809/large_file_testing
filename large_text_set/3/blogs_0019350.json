Representational image. AFP \nThe Railways' policy envisages participation of private players in recycling water for non-potable usage on BOOT (build, own, operate and transfer) basis. \"Today is the World Water Day. But I believe observing it for just one day will not serve the purpose. It should be celebrated every day,\" Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said here while launching the policy. \nThe policy covers all aspects of water usage including recycling, conservation and recharge of ground water. It also aims to improve water usage efficiency by setting up recycling plants, sewage treatment plants, effluent treatment plants and by rainwater harvesting on railways land. Private players will be encouraged to set up these plants and the Railways will ensure the purchase of treated water from these units. \nDescribing the step as environment-friendly, Prabhu said, \"We had already announced for restoration and revival of all our water bodies along the tracks and on rail land last year. We had also announced plan for plantation of five crore tress on rail land.\" The water policy is part of the commitments India has made to the UN under the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to reduce water consumption and the Railways has assumed a pro-active role in it. \nRailways also gave green certificates to Diesel Locomotive Factory at Varanasi, Perambur Carriage Workshop at Chennai. \nPublished Date: Mar 22, 2017 07:24 pm | Updated Date: Mar 22, 2017 07:24 pm Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:08:45.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
