The photographer has traveled to Scotland and Cuba for major advertising campaigns, in recent years, and is enjoying a slew of exhibitions, too. He has had a recent retrospective at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas in Austin, as well as shows in Genoa, Tokyo, Paris, and a current exhibition at the Robert Koch Gallery in San Francisco. While it’s not uncommon for artists — he prefers the term craftsman — to work until the end of their lives, Mr. Erwitt made it clear that he works out of a necessity that is less artistic than it is economic. He has four ex-wives to support. If anything, he was a tad wistful about how things might have turned out otherwise.\n“I think if didn’t have the financial pressure, I would have done a lot better,” he said. “I would have made more movies. That’s easy to say now, but I probably would have spent more time doing worthy things.”\nPhoto Coney Island, New York. 1956.

His book, “Perfect Exposures,” sits on my shelf, and its pages are well-thumbed-through.\nWhile traveling the world many times doing commercial and editorial photography as a member of Magnum, Mr. Erwitt always made time to shoot for himself. No matter if the professional work was in color, his personal work was in black and white, and always on film. These days he’ll shoot digitally for clients, but not for himself.\nThe best images from his canon are so easily recalled, like “California (California Kiss),” from 1956, which is featured in the San Francisco exhibition. We see two lovers reflected in a car’s round, rear-view mirror, while the majestic Pacific Ocean beckons in the distance. More than perhaps any other image, this came to represent an idealized West Coast optimism in 1950s America, predating even Gidget and the Beach Boys.\nIn addition to capturing this optimism so well, Mr. Erwitt is also known for his visual puns and use of humor. The jokes are often silly and obvious, but sometimes they’re high-minded and literate too, as in “Museo del Prado, Madrid,” from 1995, in which a gaggle of men are shown ogling Goya’s “The Nude Maja,” while a lone woman contemplates the clothed version of the same painting.\nPhoto New York City. 1954. Credit Elliott Erwitt/Magnum Photos He acknowledged that it was a good thing if his work was received this way, yet he denied being funny himself.\n“I don’t think my wives thought I was particularly funny,” he said. “But I certainly prefer comedy to tragedy. And if people think my pictures are amusing, I’m delighted, because I like amusing.”\nFinally, it wouldn’t be an article about Elliott Erwitt if we didn’t mention the dog photographs, since those might be the most beloved of all. It turns out that man’s best friend is no randomly chosen subject guaranteed to get giggles. He really loves dogs deeply.\nIn fact, he got a new dog not too long ago.\n“Most recently, I brought a dog back from Cuba. Just a farm dog who kept on following me around, so I brought him,” he said, before waiting a beat to deliver the punch line.\n“He barks in Spanish.”", "external_links": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/14/blogs/15-lens-elliott-embed2/15-lens-elliott-embed2-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/14/blogs/15-lens-elliott-embed/15-lens-elliott-embed-blog480.jpg", "http://kochgallery.com/exhibitions/index.html", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/14/blogs/15-lens-elliott-embed2/15-lens-elliott-embed2-blog480.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/14/blogs/15-lens-elliott-embed/15-lens-elliott-embed-superJumbo.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-15T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T09:25:08.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
