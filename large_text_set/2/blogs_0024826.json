Owner Randy Gilson gives free tours almost every afternoon. \n“I found things all over the North Side of the city of Pittsburgh,” he explains. “Brought everything in and this is what happened, and everybody likes to come and visit me. And now I’m going to be a king, I guess, huh?” \nNext week, on Fat Tuesday, he’ll be crowned king of the North Side Mardi Gras. \n“I’m a prince today,” he assures us. “I’m only a prince. I’m not a king yet.” \nHe bought a rundown house and lot for $10,000, cleaned it up, started painting, and Randyland was born. It’s open free to the public almost every afternoon. \nRandy says neighbors helped paint more a dozen repurposed doors. \n“We had a neighborhood party here, and they all came up with all the kids and families, and they painted all those doors,” he said. \n  \nRandy says he’s had visitors from 100 countries. \nA woman from Cleveland, who’s also an artist, says, “I’d love to do a house like this, but my husband there won’t let me do the house like this!” \nA visitor from Detroit marvels at the collection of reclaimed objects. \n“In our time of ecological looking at, what do we do with our stuff, this is really amazing,” she says. \nThe future king of Mardi Gras has a royal touch.
