He was in the news just a few days ago for statements about the Women‚Äôs March , including such gems as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm planning a ‚ÄòMen‚Äôs March‚Äô to protest at the creeping global emasculation of my gender by rabid feminists.‚Äù He also dismissively asserted, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be honest, ladies‚Ä¶ today‚Äôs Women‚Äôs March is just an anti-democratic protest at Trump winning the presidency.‚Äù (His Twitter profile picture is him with Donald Trump, if you were wondering.)\nEwan McGregor wasn‚Äôt happy about some of the things Morgan said, and when he found out he was about to be interviewed by Morgan on ITV‚Äôs Good Morning Britain this morning, he said no thanks.\nWas going on Good Morning Britain, didn't realise @piersmorgan was host. Won't go on with him after his comments about #WomensMarch \n‚Äî Ewan McGregor (@mcgregor_ewan) January 24, 2017 \n\nMcGregor may be promoting T2: Trainspotting , but he doesn‚Äôt have to help anybody‚Äôs ratings if he doesn‚Äôt want to. Especially when they‚Äôve slighted his daughters, who were at the march:\nI'm with you in spirit today women of the world. My daughters are marching. I'm so proud to see this extraordinary power.\n‚Äî Ewan McGregor (@mcgregor_ewan) January 21, 2017 \n\nPiers Morgan was miffed at the last minute cancellation, of course, and said several things on Twitter, including:\n\nSorry to hear that @mcgregor_ewan ‚Äì you should be big enough to allow people different political opinions. You're just an actor after all.\n‚Äî Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 24, 2017 \nI'll be writing a column about @mcgregor_ewan today, once I have sent it to him for his approval.\n‚Äî Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 24, 2017 \n\nFIGHT FIGHT FIGHT.\nWell, there wasn‚Äôt any back and forth after that, but there were plenty of other people on Twitter quick to roast one party to this kerfuffle. If it isn‚Äôt obvious by looking at the number of retweets on those statements, most of the Twitter responses sided with ‚Äúanybody but Piers Morgan‚Äù again.\nSome of Morgan‚Äôs detractors pointed out the obvious:\nIf you're going to criticise Ewan McGregor as 'just' an actor (he isn't) then Piers Morgan's just a guy on a sofa stirring arguments.\n‚Äî Rupert Myers (@RupertMyers) January 24, 2017 \n\n\nOthers just enjoyed watching the spectacle unfold:\nChoose a life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose to tell Piers Morgan to go fck himself #ewanmcgregor \n‚Äî Jane Graham (@Janeannie) January 24, 2017 \nObi-Wan Kenobi is still our only hope. https://t.co/FC2u8KrI9A \n‚Äî Tony Thaxton (@tonythaxton) January 24, 2017 \n\nAnd some of the tweets referenced Morgan‚Äôs former scandals .\na real man would have interviewed celebrities instead of hacking their phones https://t.co/rvJiGpZJF9 \n‚Äî k e e t ü•î (@KeetPotato) January 24, 2017 \n\nBut some who agreed with McGregor took things a bit too far.\nOk I like the prequels now https://t.co/0reSTDkA8S \n‚Äî Brian Collins (@BrianWCollins) January 24, 2017 \n\nNow now. Settle down, Internet.\nMeanwhile, others can only express a deep sadness.\nVery sad to hear about Piers Morgan. Nothing's happened to him, I'm just very sad to hear about him.\n‚Äî Moose Allain (@MooseAllain) January 21, 2017 \n\n\nAnyway, we‚Äôre certain McGregor is very concerned about what Morgan will say in that article he threatened to write‚Ä¶\nReddit\nReddit \n(Via Deadline and Twitter )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T14:20:46.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
