Trump overstates it. https://t.co/dBfohEZLvV pic.twitter.com/Wb95JduK3h\n— CaféPolitical (@CafePolitical) March 1, 2017\nFrom the AP :\nTRUMP: \"According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.\"\nTHE FACTS: It's unclear what Justice Department data he's citing, but the most recent government information that has come out doesn't back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were actually born in the United States, according to research from the Department of Homeland Security revealed last week. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens.\nThis terrorism data identifying 280 terrorism cases from 9/11/2001-12/31/2014 come from a Justice Department letter (dated January 13, 2016) sent to Senator Ted Cruz and then-Senator (now Attorney General) Jeff Sessions. This letter is provided below.\nWhen the staff of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest examined the open-source data for the 580 cases, this is what they found :\nBased on open-source research conducted on a list provided by the Department of Justice, the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest has determined that at least 380 of the 580 individuals convicted of terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between September 11, 2001 and December 31, 2014, were born abroad.\nOn August 12, 2015 , December 3, 2015 , and January 11, 2016 , letters were sent to the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and State, requesting the immigration histories of individuals implicated in terrorism since early 2014. For over 10 months, the Obama Administration has refused to provide this crucial and easily accessible information. Since sending the last letter on January 11, however, the Subcommittee has identified 18 additional individuals implicated in terrorism since early 2014 – bringing the total to 131 , of whom at least 16 were initially admitted to the United States as refugees, and at least 17 of whom are the natural-born citizen children of immigrants.\nHowever, the Department of Justice (DOJ) did provide the Subcommittee with a list it maintains of 580 individuals not only implicated, but convicted , of terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between September 11, 2001 and December 31, 2014. DOJ has deferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide immigration background information regarding these individuals, but to this day, DHS has not done so – despite having the information on the foreign-born easily accessible in its records and databases.\nUsing this list, the Subcommittee conducted open-source research and determined that at least 380 of the 580 were foreign-born (71 were confirmed natural-born, and the remaining 129 are not known). Of the 380 foreign-born, at least 24 were initially admitted to the United States as refugees, and at least 33 had overstayed their visas. Additionally, of those born abroad, at least 62 were from Pakistan, 28 were from Lebanon, 22 were Palestinian, 21 were from Somalia, 20 were from Yemen, 19 were from Iraq, 16 were from Jordan, 17 were from Egypt, and 10 were from Afghanistan.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2017/02/28/ap-fact-check-fail-trump-claim-on-terrorism-and-immigration-correlates-with-justice-dept-data/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/APFactCheck?src=hash", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170126063729/http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e93b5041-aee9-4289-acd2-ee46822c402e/06.14.16-doj-nsd-list.pdf", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170126063729/http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=9045A921-6A74-45EC-9F55-3D44C8A1AB5B", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170126063729/http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=C47F6414-14D7-46FF-8E0F-B772480F5791", "http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/28/ap-fact-check-trump-distorts-an-immigration-report/", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170126063729/http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e72253f2-4689-4fb5-bb5a-b754c1676a35/06.14.16-individuals-implicated-in-terrorism-since-march-2014.pdf", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170126063729/http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2016/6/at-least-580-individuals-convicted-in-terror-cases-since-9-11-at-least-380-are-foreign-born#close", "https://t.co/Wb95JduK3h", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170126063729/http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=88116277-8237-489E-8E87-B2CD612391D6", "https://twitter.com/CafePolitical/status/836796971985825793", "http://web.archive.org/web/20170126063729/http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6e9a95e6-3552-45f7-bb0c-4fd41f5a28ca/01.13.16-original-doj-nsd-list.pdf", "https://t.co/dBfohEZLvV"], "published": "2017-03-01T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T10:52:45.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
