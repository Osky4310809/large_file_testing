Meanwhile, she allegedly had a replica package with fake stones inside of her bag.\n“That’s how she tried to scam us,” Yampolski said. “She brought her own materials, wrapped it herself with her own tape and tried to pull the switch because she had the identical package in her bag, pre-made.”\nYampolski caught on to her alleged scheme and locked Milanovic in the vault while he called the cops.\nPolice arrested Milanovic on charges of grand theft and organized fraud. She was booked at Palm Beach County Jail and released on $50,000 bond on March 20.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:19:22.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
