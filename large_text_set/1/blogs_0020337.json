But, unlike Uptodown app, with Mobogenie Market you can't download any of the apps directly. Instead, you'll be redirected to Google Play. If Mobogenie Market allowed you to download apps directly it would be quite a bit more useful. Unfortunately, the only thing it does is redirect users to Google Play, so it doesn't do anything that important. In fact, it doesn't even have a review of each app (like Uptodown does). Unlike the Windows version, the Mobogenie Market doesn't allow you to download apps directly. That is to say, it really is just useful when it comes to seeing the different apps that are available so that you can go to Google Play or Uptodown and download them.
