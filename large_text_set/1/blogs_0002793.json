More by Molly Eichel \nNorth Philadelphia's own Meek Mill is a single man, at least according to erstwhile girlfriend Nicki Minaj. \nMinaj tweeted Thursday morning: \nTo confirm, yes I am single. Focusing on my work & looking forward to sharing it with you guys really soon. Have a blessed New Year. Love u�� \n— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) January 5, 2017 \nSpeculation started flying in gossip circles last month that Minaj and Meek were dunzo after the rap goddess started posting what seemed like cryptic post-split photos: \nThank God u BLUE��it. Thank God I dodged the bullet. I'm so over u. Baby good lookin out. #BestThingUNeverHad thank u for this epic gift @sincerearmani \nA photo posted by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on Dec 11, 2016 at 7:17am PST \nThe Daily News outed the pair as a couple back in 2015 , but it was rumored that they had kept their relationship a secret long before that. When Nicki read the item on their coupling, she was not thrilled : \nThe Philadelphia Daily News ����❤️ \nThat summer, Minaj used Meek as the opening act on her Pinkprint world tour (even though his extracurricular activities did not help ticket sales ) and appeared on stage with Meek at Made in America for a duet . She stayed with Mill during his house arrest (she even testified for him court ) and his feud with her buddy Drake (as well as various other rappers ). She had even become a regular courtside presence at Sixers games with Mill. \nBut, alas, it was not meant to be and Minaj is now the \" the rap game’s most eligible bachelorette .\" Will this split from such an A-level star spell good things for Mill's career? Will Minaj be added to his list of public feuds? Only time will tell. \nUpdate: Mill has responded with his own shade-filled Instagram post, writing captioning a picture of white wedge-heeled sneakers, \"If you walk out don't wear these they wack \" He has since deleted the post.
