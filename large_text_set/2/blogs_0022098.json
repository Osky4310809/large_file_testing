The best of the best. We called it the Daily Afternoon Randomness , the D.A.R. Exactly 18 people clicked on the first DAR, mostly my parents and relatives. \nIt occurred to me today that I’ve never really shown y’all how many people actually click on into the DAR everyday. It’s rather a lot. theCHIVE has surged recently as the last happy refuge on the internet and so too has the DAR. Today, over 1 Million Chivers are in here with you.

The DAR has always been my most favorite thing and I’m proud I get to share it with so many Chivers and Chivettes everyday! 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:11:34.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
