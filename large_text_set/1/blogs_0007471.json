Mourinho 'dissatisfied' with United players, fans and himself \nOne player who didn’t appear so safe though is Memhpis Depay, with Stone admitting he expects him to leave. \n“I would think there might be a defender coming in but before that, I would think that Memphis Depay would probably go as well. I don’t see [that] he’s got any future at Manchester United. Maybe Bastian Schweinsteiger, although that’s less certain. But if Memphis goes, I imagine that Jose might try and bring in another defender. Manchester United's potential January transfers Manchester United's potential January transfers 1/10 In: Victor Lindelof \nUnited have been linked with signing the Benfica centre-back for some time now. Rumours have however surfaced that the Red Devils might be deterred at the fact that the Swede has signed a new contract which will increase his release clause to a reported £50m. 2/10 In: Virgil van Dijk \nThe Southampton central defender has been subject to a lot of interest from the league’s big clubs approaching the January transfer window. Before the Saints’ last two games, they had one of the best defences in the league, and the Dutch international played a pivotal role in achieving that. 3/10 In: Antoine Griezmann \nOne of the world’s most sought-after talents, United would have to pay big money to bring him to Old Trafford. With Zlatan Ibrahimovic coming to the end of his career, Griezmann could be seen as a long-term choice to spearhead United’s attack. Atletico’s main man won Player of the Tournament at Euro 2016, after scoring six goals. 4/10 In: James Rodriguez \nThe Colombian international has spent most of this season on the sidelines, with most of his appearances coming from off the bench. Despite this, it would still require a high fee for Real Madrid to let him go after they signed him from Monaco for £63m. 5/10 In: Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco \nThis campaign, United have failed to have a consistent performer in the left-wing role with Memphis Depay and Jesse Lingard flattering to deceive for the most part. Carrasco would be a perfect fit, slotting in alongside Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan in their front three. They’d have to break the bank to prise the 23-year-old away from the Vicente Calderon, though. 6/10 In: Joel Pereira \nThe young Swiss goalkeeper has been on loan at Belenenses this term. Pereira has impressed for the Portuguese side in his eight appearances and according to reports Jose Mourinho has summoned him back to Manchester to be the third-choice goalkeeper at Old Trafford. 7/10 In: Nelson Semedo \nUnited have been heavily linked with Semedo’s teammate Lindelof, but reports suggest that Mourinho is interested in the right-back also. However it appears that Antonio Valencia has cemented his spot as the first-choice right-back, featuring in 17 Premier League games this season. 8/10 Out: Sam Johnstone \nIt is likely that 23-year-old shot-stopper Johnstone will be leaving on loan in this transfer window. After recalling Pereira, it is thought that Johnstone will be loaned out again with Aston Villa the most likely destination. 9/10 Out: Memphis Depay \nThe Dutch winger has failed to impress since Louis Van Gaal brought him to Manchester from PSV. He seems out-of-favour with Mourinho also, playing a combined total of 20 minutes in four games for the Red Devils. 10/10 Out: Morgan Schneiderlin \nHeavy interest has been displayed in the 27-year-old French midfielder this transfer window. Everton and West Brom have both declared their interest with the former recently having a £19 million bid rejected by United, with United hoping to sell him for more. Despite this, it is believed that he will be leaving Manchester this month. \n“It has, that’s the information that we keep being told. There’s a lot of reports, still, about Lindelof in Portugal but the word from here is that Manchester United have not bid and won’t be bidding.” \nDepay’s future certainly looks less certain, with Everton still hoping to sign the Netherlands winger along with Morgan Schneiderlin. A £22m deal was agreed between the two clubs on Tuesday night for Schneiderlin, and the France international will undergo a medical on Wednesday along with discussing personal terms. The agreement includes add-ons that could see the fee Everton pay United for the 27-year-old increase to £24m depending on his performance and appearances. \nDepay is still wanted by Everton , but only if United agree to a loan move ( Getty ) \nDepay’s situation is less clear. Everton retain interest in the Dutchman, but only on a loan until the end of the season, whereas United want to sell him on a permanent basis for a fee around £15m.
