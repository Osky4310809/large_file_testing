(Laurie Sparham/Disney Enterprises, Inc. )   6:00 PM \nIt’s going to be a gay old time when the live action adaptation of Disney’s 1991 animated film “Beauty and the Beast” hits theaters on Thursday and speculation about its controversial character LeFou can finally be put to rest. \nOn Tuesday, Disney Studios postponed the film’s release in Malaysia after that country’s conservative government approved the movie for theater audiences, but insisted on editing out a scene containing homosexual overtones. \nDirector Bill Condon has stoked controversy leading up to the movie’s U.S. release by drawing attention to a “gay moment” between fawning sidekick LeFou, played by Josh Gad (inset), and villainous leading man Gaston, played by Luke Evans. But he can hardly believe the situation has become so beastly. \n“It’s such a small, little smile moment, you know what I mean?” he asked us at the film’s Lincoln Center premiere. “That’s what’s so great. Finally, Thursday night, people can see the movie and you are out of this world of speculation.” \nCondon thinks that anyone who saw the 26-year-old cartoon version of “Beauty and the Beast” should have known that LeFou was infatuated with Gaston. \n“Of course!” he said, implying the character’s name says it all. “As (composer) Alan Menken says, it’s ‘LeFou!’ Absolutely.” \nCondon couldn’t wait to put his spin on the classic Disney tale. \"Beauty and the Beast\" characters LeFou and Gaston have an animated chat. (Disney) \n“I heard about it, went in and met about it, had to decide whether to do it and ultimately was like, I couldn’t bear to imagine watching somebody else’s version because I love it so much,” he said. \n“Beauty and the Beast” cast member Ewan McGregor went on Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show” on Monday night to defend LeFou. \n“He’s a gay character,” McGregor said. “It’s 2017, for f--k’s sake.” \nEmma Watson plays Belle (aka Beauty) in the film and says that the “gay moment” may have been overstated. \n“Does (LeFou) idolize Gaston? Is he in love with Gaston?” she asked during a SiriusXM segment earlier this week. “What’s the relationship there? And I think it’s incredibly subtle, to be perfectly honest.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:35:00.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
