There’s no swirling the water, willing whites to coagulate or crossing your fingers the yolks don’t break in the water. An egg poacher streamlines the process, but if you don’t have one, here are a few tips to help you succeed. \n\nThe secret to a perfectly poached egg? Vinegar! Just a teaspoon of vinegar helps the egg whites settle around the yolks, keeping the poached egg neat and nicely rounded. Also, remember to keep the poaching water at a simmer, not a boil, or the bubbles could break the fragile egg structure. \n\nHere’s how to pull it off, step by step: Acidulate the water Bring a generous amount of water to a low simmer in a large sauté pan. Add a teaspoon of distilled white vinegar to help the egg whites coagulate. Crack the egg into a dish Crack one egg into a ramekin or another small dish. This will help you pour the egg into the hot liquid. Check for shells. Pour the egg into the water Gently ease the egg into the simmering water, starting near one edge of the pan. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Keep track of the order in which you added the eggs. Simmer the eggs Gently simmer the eggs, using a slotted spoon to keep them separated, for 3 minutes if you like runny yolks or 5 minutes if you prefer the yolks more set. Remove the eggs from the water Using the slotted spoon, gently scoop out the first egg you put into the water, blot it on a paper towel and transfer it to a cutting board. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Trim the eggs Use a paring knife to trim off the ragged edges of the eggs to make a neat appearance. Serve right away. \n\nUse your beautifully poached eggs to top a variety of breakfast and brunch dishes, such as Eggs Benedict or simply creamy polenta with sautéed greens.
