It sounds overwhelming and mildly terrifying, but if you’re a cosmetic company and not a singular person, it’s exactly the type of milestone you’re working towards. So in celebration, ColourPop is dropping a new eyeshadow in honor of reaching their millionth follower on Facebook.\nThe newest eyeshadow from ColourPop is appropriately named Milli, and it’s a shimmery golden eyeshadow that visually encapsulates the feeling of being loved by millions of devoted strangers.\nMILLI !
