As membership continues to grow within the American Association for Nude Recreation ( AANR ) so grows the demand for more upscale accommodations in resorts for the nudist lifestyle. It seems not everyone that enjoys the nudist lifestyle wants to spend their vacation in a tent or trailer. \nCaliente Resort in Pasco County came to the rescue not only meeting the demand, but far exceeding most expectations for a United States nudist resort. \nPasco County , long known as the area's nudist capital of the world has had private resorts catering to the naturist lifestyle since 1947 when Lake Como first opened. Most of these older resorts provided very few amenities and a campsite to vacationers with RVs or tents. \nPhotos of Caliente \nBuilt in 2004, Caliente Resort is more on par with some of the Orlando area's finest resorts with it's quarter acre tropical pool and 33,000 square foot clubhouse. In addition to the lagoon pool with two tropical islands and the refreshing grotto waterfall, you will find two hot tubs and six additional pools for volleyball, socializing and relaxing. \ncontinue reading below our video Tipping Etiquette Around the World \nSuch a tropical paradise is bound to put just about anyone in the mood for a creamy pina colada or a juicy daiquiri! Caliente features two pool side bars serving refreshing drinks, beer wine and a nice selection of sandwiches and light bites. \nFor a more extensive selection of entrees, the upstairs sports bar fits the bill with it's casual indoor seating and outdoor pool-view veranda tables. \nAs evening approaches, Caliente's main dining room, adjacent to the piano bar lounge beckons with a delightful aroma. The already extensive menu is enhanced with daily chef specials. Whether you are in the mood for salads, chicken, fish or steaks, you won't be disappointed by the quality or quantity. Depending on how hearty your appetite, many of the entrees are large enough to share. \nAs delicious as the food is, the service is even better! This is evident from the moment that you arrive and are greeted with a glass of champagne. I'm guessing that the staff here loves their jobs! \nOther surprises that you will find at Caliente are the state of the art Spa Sereno, indulging guests in everything from body wraps to laser hair removal. \nThough unlike the typical Orlando resort, Caliente is also a residential community with a fairly large number of homes - actually 351 of them. These home sites were set up for individuals who either wanted to have a permanent or second home in a non-textile environment. \nAccommodations at Caliente: Motel Rooms: Located closest to the clubhouse and pool, these rooms have a king-sized bed and include a small refrigerator and microwave. Casitas: One bedroom with a living room, dining room and full kitchen. Condominiums: One and two bedroom condos are available for rent. Both contain a living room, dining room and full kitchen. Villas: Three bedroom, two story villas are the ultimate in luxury accommodations at Caliente.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:53:35.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
