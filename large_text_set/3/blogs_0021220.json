Her journey to almost 200 countries took 18 months and 10 days. However, those 18 months were not all smooth sailing. \nShe took nearly as much time planning the trip as she took traveling. In addition to saving up her money, De Pecol secured funding via partners, non-profits, sponsors and investors. \nThis 27-year-old broke the record for traveling to every country in the world. Here‚Äôs how she paid for it all ‚úàÔ∏èÔ∏èüåé \nPosted by MONEY on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 \nShe saved up money while babysitting in order to get herself off the ground. \n‚ÄúI pretty much had to give up my social life, no going out,‚Äù De Pecol said. She saved $10,000 on her own before heading out on her adventure. \nFrom there, De Pecol began marketing herself like an athlete and sending pitches to companies, requesting sponsorship. She registered herself as an LLC and began sending cold emails, reaching out on LinkedIn and networking with as many potential sponsors as she could. \nBut even the best-laid plans can run awry. Eight months into her journey, De Pecol ran out of money and had to return to the United States, which she called ‚Äúembarrassing.‚Äù Because of Guinness World Record rules, she could only spend 14 days in the country. So she spent about 15 hours on the computer each of those days, reaching out to companies and asking for funding. \nShe realized that in order to finish her travels , she would need to continue seeking sponsorship while on the road. It was no longer just traveling around the world to see it; she had to continually keep seeking money while traveling. \nWhile on her travels, De Pecol partnered with organizations and gave talks to support herself. \nEven though her journey was filled with monetary ups and downs, De Pecol continues to encourage others (especially solo female travelers) to save up, travel light, and hit the road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:31:47.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
