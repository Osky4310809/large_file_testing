Worsnop recently appeared on Lead Singer Syndrome podcast (listen to it below) and claimed that his legal team put a stop to the practice. He said of that: \n\"He was just keepin' my seat warm. Honestly I don't know the kid so I have no opinion of him as a person. When people start telling me stories, my response is like... I don't wanna know. I met the kid one time on a tour in Russia and he got a picture with me outside of a hotel. Thatâ€™s my extent of my knowledge of him.\" \nHe continued: \n\"The only weird thing was, and this was like, it was like almost illegal. He was lip syncing over my stuff for a minute. That obviously did not rub me or my lawyers the right way.\" \n\"They jumped on it before I did. They were like 'hey just so you know we sent him a cease and desist because he's lip syncing over your stuff.' I hadn't seen them or heard them with him so I was just like yeah make sure he's not using my stuff.\" This story was written by a UG user. Have anything interesting to share with the community?
