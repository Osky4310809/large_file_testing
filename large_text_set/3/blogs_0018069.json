Mesut Ozil has come under fire for a series of underwhelming performances this term \nTwo-time UEFA Goalkeeper of the Year Lehmann has also been left underwhelmed by the performances of defender Shokdran Mustafi, who joined Arsenal in a £35m deal from Valencia last summer. \n\"They talk about Sanchez being a big player but if you are sulking, you can't be a big player,\" Lehmann told The Sun. Jens Lehmann played 200 games for Arsenal and helped the club reach the 2006 Champions League final \n\"You must be a big player mentally, not just be good at dribbling. \n\"There's always a question with Ozil - how much can he contribute when it gets tough? Shkodran Mustafi (L) and Nacho Monreal exchange views during last month's 3-1 loss at Chelsea \n\"It's not Mustafi's fault someone has paid £35m for him. If someone buys me for £35m, the next day I'm not a better player. \n\"He is giving everything. But sometimes the team concede five, so he has to ask himself if it's good enough?\" Wenger has yet to confirm whether he will extend his stay as Arsenal manager beyond the end of this season \nArsenal's suffered their fourth defeat in five Premier League matches, losing 3-1 at West Brom last weekend, leaving them sixth in the table, level on points with seventh-placed Everton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:53:07.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
