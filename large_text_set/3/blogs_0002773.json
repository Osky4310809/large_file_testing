Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \"This is not even a close call; it is a must.\" \nAt the confirmation hearing in January, Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota alerted Sessions to allegations of contact between Russia and Trump aides during the 2016 election . He asked Sessions what he would do if there was evidence that anyone from the campaign was in touch with Russia. \nSessions said he was \"unaware of those activities.\" \n\"I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have, did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it,\" Sessions said. \nFlores, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said that response was not misleading. \n\"He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign — not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee,\" she said. \nThe White House did not immediately comment. \n(AP)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T07:08:18.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
