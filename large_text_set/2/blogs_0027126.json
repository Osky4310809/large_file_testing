Furthermore, the representative also stated that CEMA would be organizing a disciplinary coordination ethics committee next week for deliberations on the matter. \nThe representative continued, “We will take both perspectives into equal consideration before making a final decision. We will also be reaching out to Teen Top’s L.Joe to partake in the deliberations.” \nMeanwhile, Teen Top’s L.Joe filed for a contract termination earlier this month; however, as there is still time left on his contract, TOP Media has stated that they would like L.Joe to continue promoting as part of Teen Top for the remainder of his contract. According to TOP Media, L.Joe’s contract does not expire until January 2018, meaning there are still 10 months left on his contract.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:45:52.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
