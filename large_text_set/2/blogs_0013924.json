In the segment, the two looked at old photos of the Mad Men actress, reported Entertainment Weekly , and Christina Hendricks looks like a beautiful goth kid in the high school throwback pics.\nCurrently, the actress is in the new comedy Fist Fight , along with Charlie Day and Ice Cube. All three play teachers. Hendricks told Colbert about what it was like being back inside of a high school for the movie.\n“We shot in an old high school in Atlanta, and I walked in and the smell smells like a high school, and I felt like the nerd I was [back then],” Hendricks told Colbert. Even though it’s hard to picture Hendricks without her Mad Men persona, she definitely piqued our interest about what she was like in high school. Of course, to help answer the question, Colbert had a couple photos of Hendricks from back in the day . Hence, the “beautiful goth kid” reference of ours earlier.\nYou can check out the photos in T he Late Show clip here. Hint: She was a fan of red lipstick even then, but with a goth twist. Okay, we don’t know about you, but we love Hendricks even more after watching that clip. And now, if you’ll excuse us while we go get tickets for Fist Fight , which just came out February 17th.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:54:39.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
