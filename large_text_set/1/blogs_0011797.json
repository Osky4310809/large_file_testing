Photo by Josh Albelda/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Guard Philip Paniamogan exploded for a career-high 25 points off the bench and the Mahindra Floodbuster pounded the slumping Meralco Bolts, 105-92, in the 2017 PBA Philippine Cup on Wednesday, January 11 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. \nThe sophomore was on fire with 7-of-9 shooting from downtown as the Floodbuster ran away with the game in the final frame. \n\"He came up big tonight. I honestly I really saw it coming from Christmas Day because even during the break he was one of those guys who was asking me to keep working,\" coach Chris Gavina said of Paniamogan, the former Jose Rizal University standout who finally had a breakout game after an unsteady PBA career so far since he went undrafted in 2014. \n\"He just does what you want him to do. He’s somebody who accepts his role and when he’s called upon he’s ready to excel.\" \nFive other Mahindra players made it to double figures with Jason Deutchman, Alex Mallari, and Nico Salva all tallying 13 points each. \nMike Digregorio had 11 markers while Russel Escoto added 10 points and 5 boards as the Floodbuster racked up 21 total three-pointers all game, compared to just 7 by the Bolts. \nAside from being only Mahindra's second straight victory of the conference, this victory holds extra weight for it is dedicated to the ailing wife of team consultant Joe Lipa. Gavina said Lipa's wife, who suffers from cancer, just got out of the hospital. \n\"I wanted to really dedicated to this game to coach Joe and his wife. If you're watching, coach, this is for you,\" Gavina said. \nMeanwhile, Meralco had Reynel Hugnatan with a game-high 28 points, and Chris Newsome pouring 19 markers and dishing out 8 assists. Baser Amer added 12 points in 20 minutes. \nMahindra to a 2-5 record after back-to-back wins as Meralco continues its downward spiral with its fifth straight loss, mirroring their disappointing Philippine Cup showing last season. \nThe Bolts sit at the bottom of the standings with a 2-6 record. \nScores : Mahindra (105) : Paniamogan 25, Mallari 13, Deutchman 13, Salva 13, Digregorio 11, Escoto 10, Yee 8, Elorde 4, Ballesteros 3, Arana 3, Revilla 2, Celda 0, Nimes 0, Eriobu 0, Teng 0.
