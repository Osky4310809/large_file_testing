The suit charges that the government is violating both the U.S. Constitution’s Spending Clause and the 10th Amendment by forcing Tennessee to cover the costs of refugee resettlement in the state even though Tennessee dropped out of the program in 2008. \nUnder the 1980 Refugee Act, the federal government promised to provide 100 percent of the state share of refugee cash and medical welfare costs for the first 36 months of their resettlement. That constituted a significant savings for participating states, especially considering that refugees use welfare at very high rates . However, by 1991 the feds had stopped reimbursing states altogether. The refugee program has become an unfunded mandate. \nAdding insult to injury, starting in 1995, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), began assigning a private refugee resettlement contractor (called Voluntary Agency or VOLAG) to keep the resettlement program running in states that drop out. This would ensure a continual flow of refugees to the state. \nIn addition to welfare, refugees bring significant other costs, including interpreters, English classes for students, medical and other services. For example, in 2016, Amarillo, Texas Mayor Paul Harpole complained , “We have 660 (refugee) kids who don’t speak English and the U.S. Department of Education says they have to be at grade level within one year. It’s a ludicrous requirement — they don’t even know how to use the bathroom.” \nAmarillo received $100 per student from the feds to accomplish this goal, whereas thirty days of tutoring cost $ 1,300 per student . “We’ve been a giving community,” Harpole said, “and it’s a huge disservice to bring in refugees in numbers that we’re not able to handle…” Manchester, New Hampshire Mayor Ted Gatsas has repeatedly requested a moratorium on refugee resettlement. “I think at last check we had something like 82 languages represented at Central High School,” he said. \nManchester’s school ratings now rank second to last in the state. \nThe U.S. government pays VOLAGs by the head to resettle refugees. The Government Accountability Office found that this gives VOLAGs a strong incentive to maintain or increase the flow of refugees. Local leaders complain that VOLAGs ignore community concerns and continue to resettle refugees in their communities even when asked to stop. \nThis tendency is magnified when states drop out because the VOLAG runs the entire program without any input or oversight from the state. Tennessee left the program effective June 2008. After 2008, the number of refugees admitted annually more than doubled.
