Yesterday, reports suggested that Russian president Vladimir Putin has considered giving him up to American authorities in an effort to “curry favor” with Trump.\nTrump has said that Snowden is a “traitor” and a “spy” who ought to be executed for his actions, yet Snowden’s initial reaction seemed relatively chipper. In a tweet directly referring the news, Snowden said it vindicated him from critics who accused him of being a spy who cooperated with Russia and endangered American forces:\nFinally: irrefutable evidence that I never cooperated with Russian intel. No country trades away spies, as the rest would fear they're next. https://t.co/YONqZ1gYqm\n— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 10, 2017\nSnowden also posted an interview he once did with Katie Couric , where he talked about what it would possibly be like for him if he was returned to America under Trump.\nHere’s what @snowden told me about the possibility of Putin handing him over as a good will gesture to the Trump administration. pic.twitter.com/LdoxE7cYvA\n— Katie Couric (@katiecouric) February 10, 2017\nSnowden posted more tweets on Saturday, where he seemed to suggest that the reports could have started after he recently criticized the Russian government’s policy:\nDays ago, I criticized the Russian government's oppressive new \"Big Brother\" law. Now, threatening rumors. But I won't stop. https://t.co/UFkIR1Rx8N\n— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 11, 2017\nI don't know if the rumors are true. But I can tell you this: I am not afraid. There are things that must be said no matter the consequence.\n— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 11, 2017\nDon't be afraid. Be ready. There are more of us than them.\n— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 11, 2017\n[Image via screengrab]\n— —\n>> Follow Ken Meyer (@KenMeyer91) on Twitter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/830527432964841472", "https://t.co/YONqZ1gYqm", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fi-am-not-afraid-snowden-reacts-to-reports-that-russia-might-gift-him-to-trump%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-11-at-5.33.46-PM-650x367.jpg&description=%26%238216%3BI%20Am%20Not%20Afraid%26%238217%3B%3A%20Snowden%20Reacts%20to%20Reports%20that%20Russia%20Might%20%26%238216%3BGift%26%238217%3B%20Him%20to%20Trump", "https://twitter.com/katiecouric/status/830200506496720896", "https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/830528126929219584", "https://t.co/LdoxE7cYvA", "https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/830528333083471872", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://t.co/UFkIR1Rx8N", "https://twitter.com/KenMeyer91", "https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/830200565720346624", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fi-am-not-afraid-snowden-reacts-to-reports-that-russia-might-gift-him-to-trump%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://twitter.com/Snowden"], "published": "2017-02-12T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:52:27.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
