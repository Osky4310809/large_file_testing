Bob Casey, D-Pa., and fellow Pittsburghers who testified Tuesday at a Senate hearing on challenges faced by grandparents raising grandchildren. With them are Ann Sinsheimer, second from left, and her husband Marvin Sirbu, right, who are raising granddaughters in Oakland. By Tracie Mauriello / Post-Gazette Washington Bureau \nWASHINGTON — They’ve delayed retirement, learned to soothe night terrors, passed up vacations, hired an au pair, bought bunk beds, adjusted work schedules, and traded gourmet dinners for boxed macaroni and cheese. \nThis isn’t how Marvin Sirbu pictured life at 71 or how his wife Ann Sinsheimer pictured life at 54. \nThe Oakland couple are among 2.6 million nationwide who are primary caregivers to their grandchildren. \nU.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, wants the federal government to help these “grandfamilies,” who are now raising 3 percent of the country’s youth. \n“They get up every day and take on difficult tasks of raising children when they were looking forward to a tranquil and restful retirement,” Mr. Casey said during a hearing Tuesday where Mr. Sirbu and Ms. Sinsheimer were invited to testify. \n“I do believe that we can come together and do more,” Mr. Casey said. “There has to be a way that the federal government can be a constructive partner in helping states and countries to aggregate services.” \nMembers proposed no specific legislation. Rather the hearing was held to raise awareness and begin a discussion of the issue in the context of opioid addiction, said chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine. \n“At a time in life when most seniors are looking forward to enjoying more leisure time, these grandparents have found themselves as parents again. They are waking up in the middle of the night to feed babies, and planning afternoons around soccer practice rather than golf games or volunteering,” Ms. Collins said. \nAs the senator spoke, Ms. Sinsheimer nodded knowingly from her seat in the hearing room. \nMs. Collins went on to describe social, emotional and legal challenges grandfamilies know all too well. \n“It can be emotionally difficult to go from being a grandmother who spoils the kids to becoming the disciplinarian who makes sure that homework is finished,” she said. \nFor Mr. Sirbu and Ms. Sinsheimer, that transition occurred 18 months ago when they realized his opioid-addicted daughter was too unstable to continue raising her children. The girls, 5 and 8, now live with them. Mr. Sirbu is their legal guardian, and life has never been the same. \nThe challenges are numerous — from financial to emotional to social. \n“We’re in such a different world from our peers,” Ms. Sinsheimer said. \nThe government can do more to help, she said. \n“It’s hard to find services for people like us. We need therapists who understand the problems of children who are addicted, and help thinking about what we need to do to take care of them. Social services aren’t geared toward us,” Mr. Sirbu said. \nBoth university professors — he at Carnegie Mellon and she at the University of Pittsburgh -- they know they are better off than others raising grandchildren. \n“We have flexible jobs. We’re academics, and we’re able to juggle our schedules for a while,” Ms. Sinsheimer said. And when it became too much, they were able to afford an au pair to provide after-school care. \n“We have the resources to absorb it, and we dealt with it without some of the stress and exhaustion” that other grandparents might have, she said. “This is a huge problem that impacts people across party lines and across income levels — people who need as much support as possible.” \nThe Senate panel also heard from Sharon McDaniel, president and CEO of A Second Chance, which supports family caregivers in Philadelphia and Allegheny counties. Opioid addiction is increasing the need, testified Ms. McDaniel, who lives in Pittsburgh. \n“Grandparents are often on limited resources or poor … so we see them going back into the workforce,” she said. “They need navigator programs, which assist them with identifying and accessing available services including mental health services, financial assistance, counseling, support groups, legal assistance and respite care — all of which are essential.” \nMs. McDaniel also asked lawmakers to ensure senior centers are equipped to support grandfamilies and to create drug treatment centers that address needs of entire families including grandparents raising children of addicts. \nMs. Collins said she wants to help. \n“We are going to continue to work together to look at what else we can do,” she said. “We have an enormous debt of gratitude to these grandparents that are opening their homes and their hearts to their children’s children.” \nWashington Bureau Chief Tracie Mauriello: tmauriello@post-gazette.com; 703-996-9292 or on Twitter @pgPoliTweets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:31:43.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
