A revised version of the ban was stayed by a federal judge in Hawaii that same night. \nThings broke down early after former federal prosecutor John Flannery accused Harvard Law School’s Alan Dershowitz of supporting the ban because he thought it would be good for Israel. \n“Our dear colleague, Alan Dershowitz, I think, hopes that this may secure Israel,” said Flannery \n“What are you talking about?” Dershowitz interrupted. \n“I think it’s a powerful argument that we’ve established religion in this fashion through this ban that is transparently against Muslims,” Flannery continued. \n“You’re lying through your teeth,” Dershowitz growled. “I never said a word about Israel. When you focus on everything I say about Israel it really raises questions about your own bigotry and biases, so let’s get to the point and just keep your mouth shut.” \nDershowitz then launched into his explanation of why he believed that while the ban was “bad policy” it was constitutional. After a bit of legal back-and-fourth, things came back to Israel \n“What does this have to do with Israel?” Dershowitz snapped again. “Why in your bigoted background do you have to bring in Israel to attack me? Your bigotry is showing.” \n“I believe that’s the reason you’re taking the position you are,” said Flannery sparking a paroxysm from Dershowitz. \n“You can’t believe anything I say because I’m a Jew and a Zionist?” he asked. “For shame on you sir. I never want to be on the show with this bigot again!” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T14:08:34.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
