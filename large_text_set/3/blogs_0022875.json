Abrams’ Bad Robot production company to produce a new TV series about his life. \nThe half-hour dramedy series will be set in New York City during the Reagan era 1980s and will be a fictionalized version of Ru’s rise from club kid to drag queen to gay icon to global superstar. \nRuPaul, who will executive produce the show along side his World of Wonder colleagues Fenton Bailey, Randy Barbato, and Tom Campbell, says the premise was inspired by his own story, which involved growing up in San Diego and then moving to Atlanta to study performing arts, relocating to New York and becoming a popular fixture in the gay club scene. \nThe show doesn’t have a title yet and is still being shopped around to networks. Given the fact that everything RuPaul touches these days seems to turn to gold, we’re pretty sure it’s going to be scooped up in no time. \nRelated: Mediocre Lady Gaga impersonator stuns Drag Race contestants by actually being Lady Gaga ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:36:36.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
