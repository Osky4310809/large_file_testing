When the Tigrex has been flashed by a hunter it may stay in a spot for a minute but it'll eventually do its special 360. For a blademaster, this can be real tricky to try and get out of. \"Ledging\" is possible with the Tigrex: when it charges, stand in front of a wall and move away with precise timing and it will bite into the wall, becoming stuck and effectively allowing players to land a few free hits allowing time to cut off its tail, as well as dropping Wyvern Tears or Wyvern Sobs (HR6 and above Tigrex). It is possible to break both front claws, wound the head once (horns/eye) and cut the tail off for more rewards. Wounding the head will give a chance to obtain Tigrex Skull Shells in the rewards. While it is in rage mode it is prone to doing its 'Leap Forward' attack. If it performs this attack two times in a row it will often stop for a few seconds and taunt, giving hunters an opening for a full charged attack. When in non-rage mode, it may leap a third time. In G-rank it has been observed doing this while in rage mode. Tigrex's roar requires HG Earplugs to block and causes damage to hunters. Tigrex, along with Rathalos , made a cameo appearance as secret bosses in another PlayStation Portable Game, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker . The Tigrex' roar is one of very few that can damage close-ranged hunters, the others being Ukanlos , Kamu Orugaron , Nono Orugaron , and Akantor 's roars ( Rajang 's roar knocks the too-close Hunter backwards, but doesn't deal damage). When in its enraged state its eyes will turn red and veins will show up on its arms, that glow red when blood flows through its veins. Tigrex also appears in Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Felyne Village. When entering Rage Mode, it leaps a distance backward then performs the powerful roar. When flinching it goes 2 steps backward and shakes its head. It is also performed by Nargacuga when flinched. According to one of the Uniqlo Monster Hunter 10th Anniversary T-Shirts , the size of the foot of a Tigrex is 184 centimeters. \nWhen weak, the Tigrex will retreat to Area 3 of the Snowy Mountains or Area 9 of the Desert to rest. In the Desert, Cephalos will occasionally attack Tigrex, in the same way Velociprey sometimes attack Rathian instead of the hunter. Tigrex is one of very few monsters that a 'Poisoned/Drugged/Tainted Meat' will work on. After roughly 10-15 minutes of fighting, Tigrex will become hungry enough to cease fighting with the Hunter and consume any 'Meat' item placed in the Area. Clearing the Elder Tigrex Urgent will unlock the video Proof of A Hero. \nTigrex's boulder toss will inflict Iceblight if fought in the Tundra and Waterblight if the boulder toss is performed in the secluded and watery areas of the Sandy Plains. Tigrex's new advancing spin attack can be easily avoided by standing under its left arm as it advances and rolling away afterwards. If the Tigrex is low on Stamina, every time it attempts to charge it will try to do a U-turn, lose its footing and trip, giving hunters a brief period to attack it freely. Its speed also decreases significantly. Tigrex will eat Popo (if in the Tundra) or Aptonoth (if in the Sandy Plains) to recover Stamina. To kill them it will perform a double lunging bite. Unlike previous appearances, in MHP3rd it does not need 2 flinches for the tail to be cut off. Tigrex's arms are enlarged. It will sometimes charge one time, roar and step back to recover from charging and to stop giving hunters free hits. \nTigrex also has a new, blood colored rare subspecies that inhabits the Tower Summit known as the Molten Tigrex . Tigrex is able to climb walls while charging. If it is exhausted, however, it will lose its grip and fall down. Tigrex can look back and turn around instantly to perform a charge, bite or rock throw. Tigrex's Battle theme is changed. It can be infected by the Frenzy Virus and affected by the Apex Status. Apex Tigrex's weak spots are its head, torso, thighs and tail tip. Attacking any other part will cause the weapon to bounce and shots to be deflected, unless the Drive Wystone is active. Apex Tigrex can perform Brute Tigrex's giant roar. Apex Tigrex is unlocked in G3 Elder Hall after obtaining the G-Rank special permit by hunting a combined total of 45 Tigrex, Brute Tigrex and Molten Tigrex. Once it has been unlocked, it may also randomly appear as the target of an Urgent Quest in the Battlequarters . \nHC Tigrex requires Super HG Earplugs to block.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:29:49.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
