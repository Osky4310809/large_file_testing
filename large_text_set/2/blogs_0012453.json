When it’s from a 7-year-old who aspires to work at one of today’s biggest tech companies, even Google CEO Sundar Pichai can’t help but respond. \nFrom bean bag chairs to slides to go-karts, the Google offices look like a big playground to outsiders. So, it’s no surprise that kids might aspire to work there. That’s why 7-year-old Chloe Bridgewater, from Hereford, U.K., penned a letter to the “google boss” asking for a job.

The sweet letter eventually made its way to the “google boss,” and Sundar Pichai responded with words of encouragement. In his letter to Bridgewater, Pichai writes that he hopes she will continue to learn about technology and tells her, “I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to.” \nOn a concluding note, Pichai tells Bridgewater, “I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :)” Rose Leadem", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:59:50.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
