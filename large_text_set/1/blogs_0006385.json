And if so, what are the agency findings?” he asked. \n“I would never comment on investigation whether we have one or not in an open forum like this,” Comey said. “I really can’t answer one way or another.” \n“Will you provide an unclassified response to these questions and release it to the American people prior to January 20?” Wyden pressed. January 20 is the date of Trump’s inauguration. \n“Sir, I will answer any question you ask, but the answer will likely be the same as I just gave you. I can’t talk about it,” Comey responded. \nWyden urged Comey to release on unclassified report on the issue before Trump took office. “[If] that doesn’t happen before January 20, I’m not sure it’s going to happen. That’s why I am troubled,” he said. \nWatch above, via CSPAN2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T22:57:04.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
