She was on the U.K. edition of Celebrity Big Brother way before we were born and ACTUALLY won (under some very controversial circumstances, of course). But that was all in the past. Now Mrs. Kundra spends a lot of her time keeping her waist snatch and judging reality shows. For her latest outing on Indian Idol , the leggy vixen wore a red cape and dhoti combo, paired with a stunning silver choker. Her signature big Bollywood blow dry and delicate silver juttis finished off her look. \nLooking at her T.V appearances, Sonakshi Sinha is definitely on her way to becoming the next big reality show judge (seen here for Nach Baliye ). Is she even equipped to judge a singing (or dancing) show is a long discussion meant for another time, but her scarlet red gown with a built in corset was a definite hit. \nAnushka Sharma is not a reality show judge. However, she is definitely using the TV show to promote her new movie called, Slicked Back Hair ... A Story. Just kidding! This appearance was for Indian Idol and her midnight blue body-con jersey dress is a little out of character for an otherwise bohemian Anushka, but she looks umm ... good in it. All she needs is to put some blush in her cheeks and ditch that hairstyle - for good!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T04:59:14.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
