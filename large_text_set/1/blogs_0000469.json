Marcus Smart (intestinal issue) and Tyler Zeller (sinus problem) were admitted to the hospital last night and had yet to be released as the team went through its first full session since Friday night's win over Miami.\nIn addition, James Young missed the practice after spraining his right ankle in a younger players' workout yesterday.\n\"Marcus, he has the bug that has been going around, the GI (gastro-intestinal) bug,\" said Brad Stevens. \"And then Tyler’s had an ear infection and some sinusitis for a while. He was really feeling under the weather yesterday, more so than even in the past couple of weeks, and he’s been battling for a while now. Hopefully those guys get discharged soon and are able to join us ASAP.\n\"James Young sprained his ankle yesterday. We had the young guys over, and they played some 2-on-2 and 3-on-3 and did some skill work. All the old guys had two straight days off. The young guys came over and did some stuff, and he sprained his ankle coming down after a shot.\"\nOn the positive side of the ledger, Avery Bradley was back after missing Friday's game with the same illness that has been dogging the Celts.\n\"[He] felt fine, practiced all the way through, looked good,\" reported the coach. \"We’ve gone through it as a team pretty good. Obviously, Avery missed the last game. We’ve had staff members, players, everybody’s been dealing with it. It’s one of those things when you hang out together all the time.\"\nThat was just one reason the regulars got two days off before returning today to prepare for tomorrow night's game against Utah.\n\"Sometimes you give them [time off] to unwind and relax, but this was necessary just to get off their feet and get ready for another month of basketball,\" Stevens said. \"I think the biggest thing is look at what we’re doing well, look at what we’re not doing well, come back, have a couple of emphases and move forward. Obviously you’re going to always focus on who you’re playing next, but at the same time, it’s important at times in the year when you can, to look at yourself and figure out what you need to do better.\"\nMost of those issues appear to be on the defensive end, according to Stevens, who wouldn’t elaborate on specifics\nThomas visits Huskies\nIsaiah Thomas went from the high of scoring 52 points in Friday's win to traveling to Atlanta to see his Washington Huskies lose to Alabama, 24-7, the next afternoon.\n\"It was nice, other than Alabama,\" said Thomas. \"They’re not a college team. Those kids, like, they’re younger than me. They’re not in college. They can’t be. Like, those guys are huge. But it was a good experience. That was my first bowl game, and just to get back in that college atmosphere was fun. It was nice.\"\nThomas said people were talking to him about his performance the night before.\n\"It was all love. It was good support,\" he said. \"It was good to be around those type of people again, and I was happy I went. It sucked we lost, but at least we lost to an NFL team, not no college team.\"\nThomas lobbies for honor\nThe league office had yet to announce its Players of the Month honors for the conferences when Thomas was chatting, but he smiled when asked if he should get consideration in the East.\n\"Hell yeah,\" he said. \"I better. I mean, we had a good month as a team, as well, so I know that takes care of individual awards. But, yeah, I definitely should get that award. For sure.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:45:06.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
