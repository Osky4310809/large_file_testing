What about his health? \nThere’s a rumour doing the rounds that Hazard might not be fit. \nIt’s not clear what injury Hazard is carrying, but it feels like this theory could be a handy excuse for below-par performances. \nIt should be stressed that there’s no hard evidence backing up the Hazard injury claims. \nRead tweets on the topic below.
