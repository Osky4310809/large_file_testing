The woman appeared to be hunched over and was using two canes as she walked. \nA split second after the pair brought her off the track the New Jersey Transit train is seen hurtling past. \nThe first man to come to the woman’s rescue has been identified as 28-year-old Jonathan Mango. He told CBS News that the woman didn't appear to speak English and was initially scared of him. \n“I sprinted onto the tracks and I pulled her by the arm. She was scared, like I was trying to do something,” Mango said. \nThe second man has not been identified as he left before police arrived. \nPolice said the woman regularly walks the area and praised the “good Samaritans” for their selfless act. “She certainly had the angels watching over her today and the two individuals, angels themselves without a doubt, saved her from this near disaster,” Saddle Brook Police Chief Robert Kugler said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T03:49:57.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
