(Picture: John Kilbride/Twitter) Waitrose has insisted it is ‘great value for money’ after selling an empty jam jar for 29p more than a full one.\nThe £2 jar of absolutely nothing was first spotted by John Kilbride, a journalist from Glasgow, who compared it to a full jar of Bonne Maman that was going for £1.71.\nMan spaced out and collapsed in the street 'after taking Black Mamba drug' In a tweet that has been liked more than 5,000 times and retweeted more than 2,000, he wrote: ‘At Waitrose you can buy an empty jam jar for £2 or an identical one full of jam for £1.71. You decide…’\nSome people defended Waitrose, saying that the jar of Bonne Maman was on promotion and the empty jar was slightly bigger, even though they otherwise looked identical.\nDecisions decisions (Picture: John Kilbride/Twitter) In response, Kilbride replied that it was ‘a tiny bit bigger but a whole lot emptier’.\nMeanwhile, some joked that jams at Waitrose were clearly the ‘preserve of the wealthy’.\nScottish Independence odds see Yes as the early favourite in referendum And others said the jar should be remarketed as ‘Waitrose Bottled Fresh Air’.\nA spokeswoman for the supermarket said: ‘Our Bonne Maman conserves are on a temporary promotion and are great value for money.’\nAccording to one Twitter user, the empty jar is supposed to be used for ‘jam competitions’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T15:26:02.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
