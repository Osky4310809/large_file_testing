Missouri plans to execute one of the killers today. \nUpdated 6:30 p.m. \nThe Supreme Court of the United States has denied a stay of execution for Mark Christeson. His execution will proceed as scheduled, within the next 24 hours. \nUpdated: 6:15 p.m. \nGov. Eric Greitens on Tuesday denied clemency for Mark Christeson, a man convicted of killing a mother and her two children in 1998. \nGreitens could have appointed a board of inquiry to review the clemency request and recommend whether or not Christeson should be condemned to death, which would effectively stay the execution. \nBut in a statement, he said he would uphold the decision of the jury and the courts, who \"found these brutal crimes warranted the death penalty.\" \n\"As Governor, clemency is a power and a process I take seriously,\" Greitens said, adding he denied Christeson's request after a comprehensive review. \n\"As preparations are made to carry out the sentence, I ask that Missourians remember Susan Brouk, Adrian Brouk and Kyle Brouk at this time and keep their family members and loved ones in your thoughts and prayers,\" he said. \nJEFFERSON CITY • Missouri is preparing to execute Mark Christeson, a man convicted of killing a mother and her two children in 1998. \nHis appeals process has been wrought with conflict, with St. Louis attorneys, advocacy groups, and law students at St. Louis University fighting to delay his death until courts examine his troubled past and mistakes made by his trial lawyers. \nChristeson’s execution is scheduled during the twenty-four hour period beginning at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, at the maximum-security prison on Bonne Terre, Mo. \nIt will be the first execution under Greitens and Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, Republicans who assumed office on Jan. 9. \nHis death will mark the end of a years-long battle could be fast approaching for attorneys who argue Christeson, 37, didn’t receive due process under the law. He never appealed his sentence at the federal level because public defenders representing him at trial missed the federal appeal deadline by 117 days. \nBut for Maries County prosecutor, Terry Daley Schwartze, justice will be served for a brutal crime. \n“If there is a person who deserves the death penalty, it is this defendant,” she told the Associated Press. \nIn 1998, Christeson, then 18, and his 17-year-old cousin, Jesse Carter, broke into the home of Susan Brouk near Vichy, Mo. Armed with shotguns, they had planned to steal her car. \nOnce inside, Christeson raped Brouk. He and Carter later drove her and her two children to a nearby pond. He stabbed Brouk, 36, and slit her throat. He cut the throat of her son Kyle, 9, and held him underwater to drown. Brouk’s daughter Adrian, 12, was suffocated. \nCarter later testified against Christeson and was sentenced to life in prison. \nA plea to the nation’s highest court worked once before, when his execution was stayed in 2014, thanks in part to work by students at the death penalty clinic at the St. Louis University law school. \nAfter the stay, new attorneys were appointed for Christeson, but a U.S. district court only provided $10,000 of the $161,000 asked for – funding, his lawyers say, was necessary to bring in expert witnesses to discuss Christeson’s mental impairment and prior sexual abuse, and for IQ testing. \nThe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis later sent the case back to a district court in Kansas City, where a judge ruled that Christeson’s lawyers failing to meet the appeal deadline didn’t warrant abandonment. \nThe hearing was convened in less than 48 hours. That makes it seem like an effort to comply with the execution date set in October , rather than a chance to pore over evidence, said James Litton, a death penalty expert at the University of Missouri. \n“That aspect is disturbing to me,” said Litton, who co-chairs a team assembled by the American Bar Association to study and make recommendations regarding the laws and practices of Missouri’s capital system. \n“If the Eighth Circuit thought there was an issue here, enough to have an evidentiary hearing, it’s puzzling why they would give Christeson’s attorneys so little time to prepare,\" he added. \nIn a brief, Hawley defended that district court’s finding that Christeson “can ‘perform normal, everyday functions’ and that ‘he is able to read, write, draw, watch television, cook, make friends, and play bingo, cards, sports, and Dungeons and Dragons.’” \nHawley’s brief also points to incidents where Christeson defended himself against allegations of prison rule violations and filed bar complaints, explaining that that contradicts any claim he was entirely dependent on incompetent lawyers. \nAttorneys from Phillips Black, a non-profit law firm now representing Christeson, have alleged the state’s courts have attempted to “short circuit justice and deny process to an indigent, capital defendant.” \nAnother brief filed by groups including the National Association for Public Defense and the Macarthur Justice Center in St. Louis said problems in Missouri’s criminal justice system, including cuts to public defenders, emphasizes the need for strong capital representation – including funding for experts and investigators to aid in defense. \n“Missouri executes individuals at a rate higher than nearly every other state,” they write. “This should be no surprise given that Missouri public defenders are among the worst resourced in the country.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:15:03.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
