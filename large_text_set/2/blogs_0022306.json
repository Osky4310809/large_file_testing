Ishant Sharma will start off with the bowling proceedings and he has a couple of slips and a gully in place. Here we go!!! The players are out for their respective national anthems. Virat Kohli says wanted to bat first. Adds they have lost the toss in the past but still have won the games so this would keep them in contention. They would look at this as another challenge.

Shane Warne also says it's a good wicket and continues saying he has never seen a pitch like this. Feels this looks like a day 5 wicket. The toss will play a crucial part according to him. Unbeaten in the last 19 Tests, that is not taken to be lightly by any means.
