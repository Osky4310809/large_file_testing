He was killing everybody and fighting everyone. \n“And my father said, ‘Yeah, this one we’re going to call him Kurt [Van Damme plays Kurt Sloane in the 1989 movie Kickboxer] because he’s going to be strong and Happy because he’s going to laugh every time.’ And if the story of his MIDDLE name isn't enough, Zouma got his first from a Van Damme film! \n“Now when I see them I say, ‘Daddy, I respect you. Every time I laugh and I’m big and strong. Thank you, Dad.’ \n“I am a happy character. Every time, I laugh. You see me laughing every time everywhere, for nothing. You say ‘ABC’, I’m gonna laugh. I fall on the floor. I don’t know why. That’s my character.” \nIt was smiling and having a sense of humour which helped him through the dark days of being out for eight months with a cruciate knee ligament injury. \nZouma is back in the Chelsea set-up, starting FA Cup games and pushing to start in the Premier League after coming on as a substitute against Arsenal last Saturday.

I keep laughing. I’m still young, enjoy the life. I’m a footballer, I have a great life. So let’s laugh.” \nZouma was a mainstay in Chelsea’s last title-winning team and was named their Young Player of the Year. But 12 months ago he ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. \nThe France international centre-half stands 6ft 3in tall — and looks about 6ft wide.

I’m not scared to watch. I don’t care,” he said. “It’s very difficult when someone tells you that you’re going to be out for nine or 10 months. \n“When I saw the images I knew it was going to be long. But in my mind I said, ‘OK, this is the injury, you’re 22, so do a good rehab, recover well and when you come back you will have plenty of time to play many games.’” \nIt has been a remarkable career for the former St Etienne defender. It's almost exactly a year since Zouma was injured against Manchester United (Photo: Man Utd via Getty) Read More Kante insists Chelsea aren't taking title for granted and will \"fight for every game\" \nHe won the title in his first season at Chelsea under Jose Mourinho and is on course to get another with Antonio Conte. \nZouma still has a huge respect for Mourinho and Conte taking him on the club’s US pre-season tour last summer is just typical of the current Chelsea boss’s ­brilliant man management. \nZouma added: “My first year at Chelsea we won the Capital One Cup and then the Premier League. I was dreaming. But managers go. It’s part of football. I don’t feel guilty. Mourinho’s gone, let’s think about the future. \n“It was a bad season, now we are doing well again. Conte loves what he does. He wants to give that special feeling to us. We need to love football like he does, to breathe football. That’s what he wants.

I didn’t know him (Conte) before, he didn’t know me. He’d just watched me in the odd game on TV, but just one or two times maybe. Then he said he trusted me. Those words made a difference. \n“He’s a really nice guy. He thinks, eats and sleeps football. He talks football, everything is football with him. He’s so passionate and he wants to give that to the players. \n“Tactically we watch a lot of videos and we learn. Details are important to him. \nHe says ‘You can’t be there, you need to be there because if the ball goes over you there you’re dead, so just anticipate.’ \n“You learn a lot with him, a lot.
