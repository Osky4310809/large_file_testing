Bitstrips started as a way to make personalized comics back in 2007, but then pivoted to creating cartoon avatars in addition to the full comic strips. The Bitmoji app allows users to customize an emoji that looks like them and respond with it in messages. \nSnapchat officially integrated Bitmoji into its own app in July , letting users link the Bitmoji app to their Snapchat account and send personalized Bitmojis to friends in chat or place them on top of messages like Snapchat's other stickers and standard emojis. \nBitmoji also expanded beyond mobile in February, adding a Chrome extension that allows users to send Bitmoji in emails, paste them in Google Docs, and more.
