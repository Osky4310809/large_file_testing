The newest hair color trend is called ‘blorange,’ and it’s exactly what it sounds like: A combination of blonde and orange that results in a sherbety pink color that would look good on just about everyone of just about any complexion.\nBlorange could also be attributed to ~blood orange~, which is a fairly accurate description of some versions of this new ‘do. We have to admit, we kind of love it. And since there seem to be many versions of coloring that qualify as blorange — including some uber caszjh ombre versions that would make it waaaay easier to maintain.\nBehold, the blorange: Uno de los tintes para cabello que vienen con más fuerza es el #blorange, que es la combinación de rubio con naranja y con el que definitivamente vas a voltear cabezas. #LógraloEnSGIS \nA photo posted by Silvia Galván Image Studio (@silviagalvanimagestudio) on Jan 17, 2017 at 9:48am PST \nWe also love this more pastel version, if you’re still feelin’ the ~pastel goth~ vibes that folks have been into lately.

But the brilliant thing about ombre is it looks INTENTIONAL when your roots grow out. #thedream #blorange is the new #grannyhair! I love this trend for a #nontraditionalbride!

(Obviously here we mean ‘bad’ like the kids say it, to mean ‘good.’ OBVIOUSLY.) We love that this is a trend that can be turned up or down depending on your coloring and personal style. You can go super bold, true blood orange OR a paler, more pastel blonde-orange. The world is your blorange, and we’re about it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:46:01.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
