By Alexandra Pannoni | Digital Producer Jan. 25, 2016, at 8:00 a.m. Cancel Praise effort and commitment – don't just focus on grades, says one school psychologist. (Westend61/Getty Images) \nMidway through the year, some high schoolers may have disappointing grades, but are reluctant to take ownership of their performance. \nSome teens are not emotionally mature enough for the independence many adolescents strive for, says John Kelly, a school psychologist at Commack High School in New York . They struggle to take responsibility for their studies. \n\"It's hard for students to see that big picture. They are in the here and now,\" says Rob Lundien, a school counselor at Staley High School in North Kansas City, Missouri . \nBut it can be a fine line for parents to walk when teaching academic responsibility, says Kelly. \nThe following tips can help parents teach their children to be responsible for themselves, and determine when and how it's appropriate for them to step in to help. \n• Be proactive: Teens today struggle to connect what they are learning in school today to life after high school, says Colleen Tortorella, a school counselor at Gateway High School in Monroeville, Pennsylvania . Knowing that their education is valuable can help them take ownership of their studies, she says. \nParents can do this by making a point to talk with teachers early on and stressing the importance of education at home, she says. \nParents should also be aware of the school's academic expectations, monitor homework and assignments, and make sure the child has a study space in the house, says Kelly, the school psychologist. This can show students that their parents value their education and thus take ownership of their studies, he says. \n[Learn how to stay academically engaged with your teen. ] \nTwitter users chimed in with their thoughts below. @alipannoni @USNewsEducation @usnews Grades don't just reflect brains, they indicate hard work & organizational skills help the teen NOW!! — Perin Lal (@perinlal) January 22, 2016 @alipannoni @USNewsEducation @usnews Earning my BA & MSW showed my kids to be accountable and do their best — Tiffany M.

The parents might want the counselor to do it for them, but the student should take ownership by talking to the teacher before others step in, he says. \nTortorella thinks parents should let their kids know it's OK to make mistakes, something she thinks many teens are afraid to do. \nTwitter users shared their thoughts below. @alipannoni @USNewsEducation @usnews Don't be afraid to allow them to fail from time to time: https://t.co/cwoQMUmGUR #SubmarineParenting — Kimberly Cooper (@literatigurl) January 21, 2016 @alipannoni @USNewsEducation @usnews Parents must hold students accountable and support rather than enable them.

Work ethic is more important to teach long term. \n\"We all struggle with challenges in our lives, but it's hard work and determination that really allows us to overcome these difficulties,\" he says. \"That's really what we want to be instilling and building up in our child, is that sense of hard work, that sense of determination.\" Have something of interest to share?
