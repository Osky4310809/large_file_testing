That’s been sparked by a fabulous maiden six months in the Championship, with minnow Burton Albion. \nAlthough they’re now stuck in a relegation battle, the mere fact they’re in England’s top flight has created a fairy tale mood that Irvine is relishing being a part of, at a club that splashed out £250,000 to snare him before the season.

My quality in front of goal has improved – it’s something I’m glad to have contributed but my all-round play has been just as pleasing. \n“With a few goals, people pay a lot of attention to goals from the middle of the park.” \nHe added: “I was asked a bit about (pressure and scrutiny) when I signed as a record signing, which comes with the pressures of its own before you’ve kicked a ball. Australia's Matthew Leckie (L) celebrates with teammate Jackson Irvine (R). Source: AFP \n“I’ve enjoyed the pressure, even the freedom that it’s given me; I’ve never been one to feel the effects of things off the park and conversation people have, it paves into the background. \n“It’s great to hear people make those sorts of jokes (like Lampard 2.0). If anything, it gives you more confidence, you want to keep impressing, show you’re capable and that’s all I’ve tried to do.” \nNow, Irvine is making statements at some of football’s most famous grounds. \nBut, he adds, not a lot has dramatically changed in his game since making the move from Scotland. \n“It’s funny, I’ve thought about this a bit recently - I wouldn’t say I was playing outrageously better than I was a year ago. At Ross County, we were top half, in a Cup final, it was a big achievement,” he says, adding that he maintains the Scottish league he came from doesn’t get the credit it deserves. \n“I was pleased with how I played. I feel I have kicked on, (gained) a bit of maturity and experience, playing amongst a different group and being involved in the national team. A bit more confidence plays a part.

Source: Supplied \n“(The biggest improvement would be) timing of runs into the box – that’s basically all eight goals, late runs into the box, something that midfielders strive to do.” \nIrvine says Burton was “the perfect fit football wise, personality wise and it has made life adapting a lot easier” when he was looking for his next challenge. \nBut how long will that remain so? He penned a three-year deal before the season and his boss Nigel Clough hopes he sticks it out. \nAs Irvine says, things move quickly. Just look at Rafa Benitez, who in the space of a year went from presiding over an El Clasico, to visiting Burton’s 6,912 capacity Pirelli Stadium as manager of Newcastle United. \n“You’re playing against guys who have been there and done that in the game. There’s a fine line between the top level, and how close you can get to it. \n“There are a lot of guys in this league that have had glittering Premier League careers; it shows the strength of the Championship. It’s so competitive, there’s so much coverage, the exposure is fantastic, and it is so highly regarded because of the size of clubs and how fiercely competitive it is.” Jackson Irvine in Australian camp.   \nAnd that exposure has seen the likes of Swansea City, Birmingham City, Derby County, Wolves, Huddersfield Town and Norwich City linked with the Aussie. \n“I’ve always said the same thing, and I was in a similar situation last year, when you’re getting linked with places: until anything’s real, it’s all speculation and rumours, and until something becomes a real viable option then you weigh up your options and take it from there. \n“As it stands, I’m six months into a three year contract and more than comfortable where I am and really comfortable with all that’s been done here. \n“But as it is in football you can’t rule anything out because nothing is definite. I’m happy where I am, comfortable, I want to fight to keep Burton in the Championship, but there’ll always be rumours and speculation – it’s a reward for good form. \n“Until anything becomes real offers, and things you need to consider, you don’t really think about it. You see they’re saying that, but we’ve got so many big games coming up I’m fully focused on those.” Jackson Irvine of Burton Albion gets past Aaron Mooy of Huddersfield Source: Getty Images \nAnd those games are absolutely pivotal to the club’s place in the Championship. While it was “dream stuff for the fans” to start the season, travelling to clubs with such rich histories and fabled stadiums, Irvine says they realise the reality of the situation they’re now in. \n“We all recognise the position we’re in, we understand what it takes to get out \n“A lot of boys are experienced campaigners at this level and higher. That blend of experience and youth has held us in good stead in performances so far, but at a club like Burton we can’t afford a 10 million pound striker like Dwight Gayle with 17 goals before Christmas.

We’ve shown on our day we’re capable of beating anyone – most of our best results have come from teams at the top of the table.” \nIrvine says the difference in the “fast, furious” league is cutting edge up front. \n“Mistakes are so quickly pounced upon and punished, that tends to be the difference.” \nHe continues: “(For us), it is about improving quality in the final third and stopping mistakes at the back. \n“Next few weeks will be key; in Scotland you can almost get away with it, playing teams four times, but with so many teams, you can never rely on other people’s results. Last weekend, with Blackburn beating Newcastle, that’s the way the league works - you can’t rely on any favours and hope that that’s enough.” Sign up for Sportsmail  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:29:40.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
