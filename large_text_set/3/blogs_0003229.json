Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Reuters \nAl-Baghdadi ordered the closure of the ISIS office regulating their fighters and ordered non-Arab fighters to either return to their countries or detonate themselves, Baghdadi, who had declared himself as Caliph, issued a statement titled 'farewell speech' which was distributed among Islamic State preachers and clerics on Tuesday, as Iraqi army tightened noose around the group's last remaining territory in Mosul, Al-Arabiya reported, quoting Iraqi TV network Alsumaria . \nCiting the sources in the Iraqi governorate of Nineveh, the report said Baghdadi ordered the closure of the Islamic State office regulating the group's fighters and asked the group's non-Arab fighters to either return to their countries or detonate themselves, promising them \"72 women in heaven.\" \nBaghdadi, who has reportedly been wounded multiple times, carries a $10 million bounty on his head. It is not clear if he is in the besieged city, where he declared his Caliphate in 2014 after the Islamic State seized territory covering much of eastern Syria and northern Iraq. \nMany of Islamic State leaders in Iraq have now fled towards the area controlled by the group in neighbouring Syria, it added. Iraqi forces backed by international and US aid launched a massive operation to retake Mosul on 17 October. In January, they captured the eastern side of Mosul â€” the last Islamic State-held city in Iraq. \nWith inputs from PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T07:01:47.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
