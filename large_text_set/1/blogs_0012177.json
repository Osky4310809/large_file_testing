The Bush sisters penned a heartfelt letter to the Obama sisters as they recognize the tremendous amount of growth which occurred right before all our eyes. But the pictures the sisters shared of Sasha and Malia’s first visit to the White House are even more adorable. Everyone has really been feeling the love for the Obama daughters. In the letter,which the Bush sisters read on the Today Show , they wrote, “Malia and Sasha, eight years ago on a cold November day , we greeted you on the steps of the White House . We saw both the light and wariness in your eyes as you gazed at your new home.”\nOne day after reading that letter, Jenna Bush Hager shared photos from the White House tour she referred to, all the way back in 2008. Sasha and Malia look so adorable in these photos and we can’t believe how quickly time flies!\n#JennaBushHager shared adorable pics of The Obama sisters visiting the White House for the first time. \nA photo posted by TheYBF (@theybf_daily) on Jan 13, 2017 at 8:20pm PST \nAbout this adorable sliding scene, the Bush sister wrote:\nThe four of us wandered the majestic halls of the house you had no choice but to move in to. When you slid down the banister of the solarium, just as we had done as 8-year-olds and again as 20-year-olds chasing our youth, your joy and laughter were contagious. \nAnother Throwback: Jenna Bush shows Sasha and Malia the Truman Balcony #maliaobama #sashaobama #michelleobama #barackobama #potus #flotus #whitehouse #firstfamily #obama #obamafamily #obamagirls #firstdaughers #melanin #melaninonfleek #blackgirlsrock #blackgirlmagic #blackexcellence #blackgirls #blackisbeautiful #slay # #carefree #jennabush #carefreeblackgirl # \nA photo posted by @fking_95 on Jan 13, 2017 at 1:00pm PST \nWhen Barack Obama first took office, Sasha was 10 and Malia was just 7 years-old. The two young girls’ looks of joy and wonder bring us back to a time of our own innocence, back when Obama had won after a campaign encouraging the public that “Yes we can!” Excuse me while I go sob uncontrollably for a sec.\n#SashaObama #WhiteHouse #Tour #flashbackfriday #BushSisters #JennaBushHager #BarbaraBush #MaliaObama #FLOTUS #POTUS #ObamaGirls #FirstDaughters #MarinaRobinson \nA photo posted by Michelle Obama & Her Family (@flotus_love) on Jan 13, 2017 at 1:37pm PST \nIn this photo of the Obama girls meeting a White House staff member, you can tell they are slightly overwhelmed, but we all know that they can handle anything . The Bush sisters perfectly express OUR exact feelings in saying to Sasha and Malia, “We have watched you grow from girls to impressive young women with grace and ease.” \nThis is nice!

(No. This is objectively the cutest image in the world.)\n\nLuckily for us, the Obama sisters will still be ruling the world, just like their mama taught them. They might be leaving the White House, but their journey through life is just getting started. We wish them all the best!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T07:03:33.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
