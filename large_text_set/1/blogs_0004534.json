JOHN UNSON SARANGANI, Philippines -- It was a misguided kind of Islamic militancy he propagated that made his followers obey him blindly and caused his death before dawn Thursday. Mohammad Jaafar Maguid, leader of the Khilafa Islamiya Philippines and known abroad as Abu Shareefa Al-Filibini, was killed in an encounter with police past 1:00 a.m. in a beach resort in Barangay Kitagas in Kiamba, Sarangani. Maguid and his followers first emerged in 2013 in Barangay Butril in Palimbang town in Sultan Kudarat, where they built a camp with a flag of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in the center. He and his men were driven away from Barangay Butril in late 2015 by combined personnel of the Regional Police Office-12 and units of the 1st Marine Brigade in an operation where seven militants perished, among them a nephew of a former congressional representative in Maguindanao province. Police agents who cornered Maguid attempted to subdue him but he resisted and pulled out a gun, prompting them to immediately neutralize him. Chief Superintendent Cedrick Train, director of PRO-12, said three of Maguid's companions immediately yielded to police when their leader was shot down. The arrested militants -- Matahata Dialawe, Arboleda Shahak, and Morhaban Veloso -- are undergoing tactical interrogation in an undisclosed police camp. Train said the three men are heavily guarded against any attempt by companions to spring them from detention. He said they learned of Maguid’s presence in Barangay Kitagas from vigilant informants and local officials who had been looking for him since 2015. “The long hand of law finally reached him,” Train said. Relatives, two of them imams, said Maguid had Malaysian and Indonesian wives who helped him maintain his connections with jihadists in the Middle East and in Pakistan. “They sent him money for his needs via an international online remittance network that has branches in most towns and cities in the Philippines,” one of the sources said. Maguid and his followers were starting to put up a “shadow government” in Butril, a hinterland area in Palimbang, when police and Marines attacked them, acting on public clamor to drive them away Residents complained of his interference in the administrative affairs of the barangay government in Butril, from whose residents his men collected “zakat,” or alms, at gunpoint. Villagers also ranted on his enforcement of a harsh Taliban-style justice system that they opposed for being obsolete and barbaric. There are stories of how Maguid ordered the killings of villagers in seaside communities in Sultan Kudarat and Sarangani for refusing to pay his group “protection money” on a regular basis. “Three of his men, Bohari, Ameer and Mosani, were trained in fabrication of home-made bombs by Marwan,” said Maguid’s 32-year-old cousin, Gamal Arip, apparently referring to the slain Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir. Marwan was killed by Special Action Force troopers of the Philippine National Police in a raid on January 25, 2015 at Barangay Pidsandawan in Mamasapano town in Maguindanao. Text messages announcing Maguid’s death immediately spread in Palimbang and elsewhere in central Mindanao, branding him a shajeed, which is Arabic for martyr. Joint effort by NICA, police, Marines, local goverment Train said the operation that resulted in the death of Maguid was carried out with the help of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency and local government units in Sarangani. He said units of the Philippine Marine Corps also helped locate Maguid through civilian informants in seaside towns in central Mindanao’s adjoining Sultan Kudarat and Maguindanao provinces. The Maguid-led radical Khilafa group is known for its links with the outlawed Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters in Maguindanao and the Dawlah Islamiya, also known as the Maute terror group, in Lanao del Sur. Investigators recovered from the slain Maguid and his three arrested companions assault rifles, ammunition and fragmentation grenades. His three men now in police custody shall be charged with illegal possession of firearms and explosives, according to Train.
