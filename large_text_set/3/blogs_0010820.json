The only Assembly votes being entered today are leftovers from Saturday night. \nThe WAEC has decided not to re-do indicative preference counts from Saturday night where the wrong final two candidates were chosen. As outlined later in this post, in these seats either the result is pretty clear from first preferences, or the final determination of candidates is being left the the formal distribution of preferences. \nBelow are some notes on the results as they stand on Sunday afternoon. Close Seats \nGeraldton : Liberal Ian Blayney has 50.8% of the vote after preferences and leads Labor's Lara Dalton by 278 votes. The counted pre-polls have Blayney leading 2821-2419 and Postal 211-117. Absents should also favour Blayney and further postals should ensure he maintains his lead. \nJandakot : Labor's Yaz Mubarakai currently sits on 50.1%, leading Liberal MP Joe Francis by 26 votes. Pre-polls so far counted broke Labor's way 1136-1084 while postals split 204-173 in favour of Francis. Likely to be decided on Absent votes which are difficult to estimate on Jandakot's radically re-drawn boundaries. \nJoondalup : Labor's Emily Hamilton currently sits on 50.5% leading Liberal MP Jan Norberger by 187 votes. Norberger has narrowed his lead on declaration votes winning counted postals 217-192 and pre-polls 832-787. Will be decided Absent votes. \nKalgoorlie : The rest of the votes will have to be counted before the order candidates will finish can be determined and a distribution of preferences undertaken. Liberal Kyran O'Donnell is favoured to win the seat. \nKingsley : Labor's Jessica Stojkovski currently sits on 50.8% leading Liberal MP Andrea Mitchell by 317 votes. No postal votes have been counted, which should favour the Liberals, while Pre-polls counted to date have favoured the Liberals 1084-974. \nMurray-Wellington : Labor's Robyn Clarke has 51.1% and leads Liberal MP Murray Cowper by 415 votes. No postal votes have been counted but Pre-polls favoured Labor 1880-1717. Absent votes are usually more favourable to Labor in this electorate than on the day votes. \nPilbara : Labor's Kevin Michel is on 51.4% leading National Brendon Grylls by 302 votes. No postal votes have been counted by Pre-polls favoured Labor 1161-1158. More importantly, while the Special Hospitals and Remotes first preferences have been counted, a 2-party preferred has not been counted. On first preferences Michel has 232 votes, Grylls 37 and all other candidates 97, which means Labor will increase its lead when these votes are added. Two-Party Preferred Count \nThe current two-party preferred count in the ABC election computer is Labor 55.7%, Coalition 44.3%, a swing of 12.9%. That total may fall with further counting. \nBack in 2005 Labor polled 52.6% after preferences. Adjusting for new boundaries with the introduction   laws, Labor went into the 2008 election with a notional 38 seats. Labor in 2017 seems to have achieved the one-vote one-value bonus that eluded it in 2008. Legislative Council \nMy ABC Legislative Council election calculators continue to tick over. As extra votes are added today, you can follow the calculations on the ABC website . Informal Votes \nInformal voting in the lower house has fallen from 6.0% to 4.4%. The WAEC believes it has achieved this with changes to wording and signage as well as deliberate targetting areas with significant non-English speaking populations. I think the switch from a vertical to a horizontal upper house ballot paper may have also played a party in reducing the number of people accidentally casting '1' only votes in the lower house. The Performance of One Nation \nPauline Hanson's One Nation did not poll nearly as well as polls predicted, though the under performance is in part due to the party not contesting every seat. \nOne Nation contested 35 of the lower house seats, though in four seats where One Nation appeared on the ballot paper, the candidate either resigned or was disendorsed before election day. \nOne Nation polled 4.7% of the state vote in the lower house, but matched its most recent opinion poll figure by recording 8.1% in the seats the party contested. \nThe party polled 7.2% in the lower house metropolitan seats it contested, and 9.6% in non-metropolitan seats it contested. The party's best lower house results were 12.7% in rural Moore, 12.6% in Mandurah south of Perth, 11.8% in Kalgoorlie and 11.3% in Warnbro, the party's best Perth result. \nIn   where One Nation contested every region, One Nation polled 7.3%. One Nation faced more competition from other minor parties in the upper house compared to the lower. \nThe Legislative Council result for One Nation was 6.4% in metroplitan Perth and 10.6% in the rest of the state. \nIn the metropolitan regions the results were 7.3% in East Metropolitan Region, 5.7% in North Metropolitan and 6.2% in South Metropolitan. \nIn non-metropolitan upper house regions One Nation polled 14.1%   Region, 11.1% in Agricultural and 9.4% in South West. \nThe party is currently projected to elect only one member, its leader Colin Ticknell in South West Region. His victory is due to Liberal preferences. A second One Nation MLC also has good chances of election   Greens \nIn contrast to One Nation, the Greens polled better than opinion polls had suggested. The party contested every lower house seat, polling 8.5% overall, 9.2% in the metropolitan area and 6.0%   state. In   the Greens polled 8.2% and are projected to win three seats, one each in North Metropolitan, East Metropolitan and South West, and still in the race for a seat   Region. \nIn individual seats, the Greens polled 18.1% in Fremantle, 16.7% in Maylands, 15.6% in Nedlands and 14.6% in Warren-Blackwood and Scarborough. Problem Preference Counts \nOn election night the WA Electoral Commission conducts indicative preference counts to help everyone try and have a clearer picture of who wins each seat. \nThe Commission does this by nominating two final candidates beforehand, and distributing the preferences of all other candidates to these two candidates. \nOn occasions the Commission picks the wrong pairing of candidates. In 2017 the Commission has chosen the wrong candidates in several seats, most due to the collapse of Liberal vote in rural seats. \nLet me make clear this preference count is not an official count. It is an indicative count, with the actual distribution of preferences candidate by candidate to determine the winning candidate not taking place until after the counting of first preference counts is complete. \nThe Commission has decided NOT to re-do indicative preference counts in any seats where the wrong candidates were chosen on election night. In most cases the winning candidate is clear without the need to re-do counts, while in others the final pairing of candidates cannot be determined and will be left until the actual distribution. \nBelow are notes on each of these seats. \nAlbany : The WAEC counted Labor v Liberal on election night but it appears the Nationals will finish second. Labor member Peter Watson has 44.1% of the first preference vote and is highly unlikely to be passed on preferences. The ABC website is showing an estimated Labor v National count. \nBaldivis : The WAEC conducted a Labor v Liberal count on election night but independent Matt Whitfield has finished second. Labor's Reece Whitby has 44.5% of the first preference vote to Whitfield's 23.5% and is unlikely to be passed. A new indicative preference count is not being undertaken ahead of the formal distribution and the ABC site is showing an estimated Labor versus Independent count. \nCentral Wheatbelt : The National versus Liberal count has been abandoned after Labor finished second. National Mia Davies will be easily elected and a new count is not being conducted. The ABC is showing estimates. \nGeraldton : The Commission conducted a Liberal versus Labor count on election night and has continued to release it. The swing shown on the ABC website compares to the Liberal versus National count in 2013. I hope to correct this swing on Monday. \nKalgoorlie : Conducted as a National versus Liberal count on election night, the indicative count has been abandoned as it is not clear who the final two contestants will be. One of them should be the Liberals, and under all possible pairings of candidates I think the Liberal Party can stay in the lead. There are no postal or absent votes counted which could change the order candidates finish. At this stage the ABC computer has been manually set as a Liberal Leading result and an estimated Liberal versus National preference count. More counting and the distribution of preferences will be required to determine the winner. \nKimberley: The indicative preference count has been ended and estimates are being used on the ABC website. The Labor Party's Josie Farrer has clearly won the seat. \nMoore : Labor finished second and the indicative National versus Liberal count has been abandoned. There is little doubt the Nationals have won the seat and the ABC site is using estimating preferences for a final National versus Liberal contest. \nNorth West Central : The WAEC's indicative count between National and Liberal has been stopped with Labor finishing second. An estimated National versus Labor count is being used on the ABC website and it appears clear that the Nationals will retain the seat. \nPilbara : A National versus Labor indicative count is still being released and has Labor's Kevin Michel ahead of National Brendan Grylls. The addition of the Special Hospital and Remote booth preference count will add another 120 votes to the Labor lead over Grylls and greatly diminish his chances of victory. The WAEC will continue the current preference count though the order of lower candidate exclusion may change with the formal distribution of preferences. \nWarren-Blackwood : The National versus Liberal count has been abandoned with Labor finsihing second. The ABC site is estimating preferences with National Terry Redman looking certain of victory on Liberal preferences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T01:13:25.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
