That’s the question many Israelis faced in Netflix ‘s “ Shadow of Truth ,” a four-part documentary series about the murder of a 13-year-old girl, Tair Rada, in Golan Heights during the daytime at her high school in 2006. Although a suspect was questioned, confessed and was eventually found guilty, his conviction has been the subject of wide controversy in the country. READ MORE: The TV Show You Need to Watch on Every Network, Right Now — a Running List Rada’s murder case was a matter of intense scrutiny by the public who didn’t want their own children to fall victim to such a senseless crime. Unfortunately, the conviction didn’t mollify the public because there were far too many pieces that didn’t add up. From the inaccurate confession and crime reenactment to a lack of DNA or fingerprint matches, nothing convincingly connected the suspect to the actual crime scene. Add to that a mysterious confession by another person in the fourth episode, and there could be serious room for doubt. Was an innocent man framed? Watch the exclusive trailer below to learn more: “Shadow of Truth” was created by three young Israeli filmmakers — Yotam Guendelman, Ari Pines and Mika Timor — and was the most popular and critically acclaimed series in Israeli history when it was released in 2016. Each of the four installments examines the case from a different point of view, in a “docu-Rashomon” style. The series also sparked a public debate about the role of film and television within an unjust system when Israel State Attorney Shai Nitzan called the show a “serious threat to democracy.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to the show’s defense and deemed Nitzan’s remark to be a serious blow to freedom of speech. The docuseries has made such a splash that Submarine Entertainment is negotiating the rights for a fiction remake on behalf of the producers Timor, Guendelman, and Ben Giladi through their EGG Films. The four-part series “Shadow of Truth” is currently streaming on Netflix. \nThis Article is related to: Television and tagged Netflix , Shadow of Truth More From IndieWire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:04:46.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
