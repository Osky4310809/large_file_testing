Yes, off-the-shoulder is so 2016 (a version of it is still cool, though) and about time you got done with that too-good-to-be-real pyjama trend. Every once in a while, we challenge ourselves to take a sartorial-vodka-shot, and have unthinkable fun afterwards. So, here's looking at five trends that guarantee a far more daring you, without a bad hangover. Take the plunge now, will you? To The Mettalic And Back \nNot just the prissy metallic skirt, commit to being the disco ball in slip tops, overflowing maxis and structured jackets. Think it's too much for you? Well, kick off the space-girl fixation with a sweet slip dress. It won't be too long before you will surprise yourself in a sexy fitted gown at friend's bachlerotte. It's an addiction, we swear!

Good news is that the merch tee can be practically paired with every single basic separate in your wardrobe. As for your reservations about being a band-love A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Dec 24, 2016 at 8:00am PST r (which you probably aren't), your love for fashion should suffice. One Dance With The One-Sleeve \nWe all love the off-shoulder (and probably will, till the end of our times). But hey, there is a new silhouette in town, which isn't far from the OG - the one-shoulder or the one-sleeve... however you like it. It's twice as feminine, and the version with ruffles is adorable. You know what to wear now, when your one side feels fatter than the other.

We join you in the perplexing question: Would I ever be able to be happy about this? Well, you most definitely will. DP looked surreal in a hue that was way less blinding than we make it out to be. There are all kinds of inclusive yellows in this world (no, all aren't as bright). And, there is a shade that will look unfairly-exquisite on you.

No, don't shun this trend as yet; we are not exactly pointing in the direction your sexy lingerie (although that won't be such a lousy idea, either). Wear your bustiers, which were meant to be worn under, over trurtlenecks. This is the kind of definition you need if you struggle with decent endowment, or lack thereof.
