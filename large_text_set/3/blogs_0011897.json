No decision has been set for Thursday, a SeaWorld Orlando spokeswoman said Monday afternoon. \nA Legoland Florida spokesman said the resort’s water park was still scheduled to be open through the week. The attraction reopened after a winter break this weekend. \nAlthough balmy by northern standards this week, midweek’s high temperatures are expected to be in the mid 60s with lows in the low 40s. A return to the 70s is forecast for Friday. \nThe cold snap is ill-timed because many schools are on spring break, which traditionally prompts a surge in visitors in Central Florida’s tourism corridor. On Sunday, Typhoon debuted a family raft ride dubbed Miss Adventure Falls. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:33:44.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
