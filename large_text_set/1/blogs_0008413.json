I want to warm my little apartment up with a big pot of something bubbling and nourishing, and I want to have friends over on a snowy day to share it with. You can try to convince me all you want that soup can be enjoyed in the summer (yes, I know gazpacho exists), but soup really is best right now. So let's enjoy it while there's snow on the ground. \nIf you, like me, are looking for inspiring recipes to get you through the winter months, I have good news. I asked 10 super-awesome bloggers to share the most popular soup recipes on their blogs. It's time to curl up and find your new favorite recipe. 1. Crockpot Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Soup from Chelsea's Messy Apron \nThis is decidedly not a wimpy soup. It's a cross between a chili and a soup, and it's chock-full of chicken, beans, and green chilies. There's also a bit of cream cheese in this soup (surprise!), which will make it extra creamy and delicious. 2. Creamy Tortellini Soup with Italian Sausage from Gimme Some Oven \nYou might have seen some kind of version of this recipe on Pinterest before, and with good reason. This recipe is totally comforting and full of sausage, pasta, and spinach. It's the kind of recipe you'd be happy to take to work on a cold day. 3. Broccoli Cheddar Soup from Little Broken \nWhat is it about this classic soup that is so comforting? I'm thinking it's the cheese. Any excuse to eat cheese, right? This recipe from Little Broken really delves deep into this special kind of comfort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T17:27:09.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
