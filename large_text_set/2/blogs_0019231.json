If so, you can cross both a country and a continent off your travel bucket list.\nIn the March/April Issue of The Geological Society of America , scientists concluded that several islands including New Zealand and New Caledonia, are not separate territories but are connected by a large swath of submerged land — an eighth continent now known as Zealandia. This piece of the earth’s continental crust is the youngest and thinnest continent on the planet, covering three million square miles, 94% of which are submerged in water.\nA map outlining the continent of Zealandia.

This isn’t even the first new continent to be discovered by scientists recently; located deep in the Indian Ocean are pieces of yet another ancient supercontinent deemed Mauritia . In this case, the entire continent, situated underneath the African island of Mauritius, is underwater — making it considerably harder for travelers to visit.\nFeatured image courtesy of Matteo Colombo via Getty Images. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:31:10.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
