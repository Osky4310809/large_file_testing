The desire to continue to push forward, in a sport that has so many strands and competing domestic and global challenges, means there is constant scrutiny on the decisions being made by the game’s power brokers. \nSystemic issues in the game aren’t necessarily the causes of the specific selection choices, tactics or logistical challenges faced by John Aloisi and Tony Popovic on Tuesday night. \nBut results like those in this week’s AFC Champions League bring the simmering tensions to the surface sharply, as fans, former players and stakeholders argue over what the game is doing right, and wrong. \nToday, it is clubs in the Champions League suffering. \nTomorrow, it could very well be the Socceroos. \n“We have got so many issues in our game that need to be addressed, spoken about and fixed,” Fox Sports football expert Mark Rudan said in the post-game coverage on Tuesday. 'This is the darkest day' 12:07 \nIt is healthy to have a conversation but it is also never straight forward; there are a myriad of complex issues, which, inevitably, come down to dollars and cents, or sense , and planning and vision, depending on who you talk to. \nWhy are football fans so vocal, so angry and so critical? And is it justified? \nThere are so many complex issues in one place, but here is a snapshot of the biggest talking points that form a tense cycle of discussion around the game. \nEXPANSION + Promotion and relegation \nFamiliarity breeds contempt and the consensus among football fans is that it’s time for more teams in the A-League to avoid the repetition of everyone playing each other three times a season. \nWe can’t have a season that is any shorter (or an off-season that is any longer) but expanding the A-League adds variety and competition that will force all clubs to lift their standards. \nThat then leads to something that goes to the next level with the incentive of relegation, which will embolden and enhance the structure of the National Premier League tier, just as the FFA Cup has done. \nGrowing the competition will have a flow-on impact as well, not simply just creating another market for the game to engage with and be promoted to. As Rudan passionately advocated, more spots opens opportunities for young Australian footballers to test themselves at a higher level. With a dearth of talent coming through and cutting it at the very top, the game needs to look at all options in its power to provide more meaningful opportunities for our next generation. \nThe Reality: Money, money, money, and the FFA doesn’t have it yet and is consulting to make a plan. But, why did it take them until February 28 to work that out, after a series of chest thumping vision and planning announcements over the last couple of years? Agitation for expansion was turbo charged when David Gallop put it on the agenda himself before the season. Expansion, promotion and relegation are all big ticket items but don’t dangle the carrot and then take it away. David Gallop tipped expansion at the season launch.

On the domestic front, it is a staple in Australian sport for competitive equality and financial prudence. \nIn the context of a global sport, it’s a suffocating noose. \nThere are all sorts of exemptions to the cap to allow clubs to make more daring plays in the transfer market but you only have to look at the exodus from Adelaide United to witness how hard it is to retain a successful squad – let alone build on it. \nThe Reality: No one wants to see two or three super clubs spend their way to a title every season, or clubs spend beyond their means to try and keep pace. But in reality, football’s context is completely different to most other Australian sports and the cap needs to continue to evolve to reflect that. Or, the reality will be a situation where we lose a player like Milos Ninkovic at the end of the season because Australia cannot keep up with the market, or another Dimitri Petratos will opt for an Ulsan Hyundai after having initially opted to move from Brisbane to Newcastle.

Eric Abrams is the currently TD at FFA, pinning his hopes on A-League clubs establishing their own academies and a football schools program similar to that used in his native Belgium. That has rendered National Youth League redundant as a pathway. \nThere’s great angst amongst former Socceroos over the production line of talent and who should share the burden of developing the next generation. \nSLATER: Shameful harm done to our youth development The most recent Olyroos outfit. Source: Twitter \nMore teams and more opportunities is certainly one solution to exposing potential stars and battle hardening them at a younger age. \nThis is one issue where the hysteria is warranted but the solution is complex: should clubs take the lead in generating our next stars? Is the coaching good enough? Are we giving young talent the time to shine? Who is in charge? \nWhen was the last time we developed a player good enough to cut it in an elite league? \nAnge Postecoglou has voiced his concerns. His side have overachieved in recent years but the future could be quite interesting indeed . \nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE RESULTS \nWe have had a chance to compare the A-League’s progress to the region and, on current displays, it’s alarming. Indeed, it’s been the spark behind this week’s conversations. \nThe Reality: The ACL is a logistical nightmare for clubs who, often, are a year past their best form with vastly different squads, at the backend of a season. \nThere was naivety, a lack of quality and drive displayed in the cataclysmic Tuesday night showing, but, a quick glance at the resources and schedule of the opponents does at least provide a mitigating circumstance. These results have been the worst we’ve witnessed, in one cluster. \nOff the field, the crowd of 1,000 that turned up in South Korea is a reminder that the ACL as a tournament has issues that Australia is not alone in dealing with.

Why aren’t Milos Ninkovic, Diego Castro and Bruno Fornaroli household names? Why are local state league games played at the same time as A-League finals? \nThere’s a lot of talk about seeing football climb the popularity rankings in Australia, cashing in on the record participation at grassroots level. That’s a lot of disparate parts of the game to try and unite but at the moment, they still seem far too disjointed. Ambition is being bold, but it’s also about walking the walk, not announcing plans to walk the walk in the future. Bruno Fornaroli Source: AAP \nWHO HAS A SAY IN RUNNING THE GAME \nThere’s a lot of disquiet on the coalface from football supporters about the messages coming out of the game’s governing body. \nAs this snapshot shows, there are A LOT of challenges on the plate of those at FFA HQ - not even touching yet on grassroots issues like the value of junior fees, or other stakeholders, like futsal. \nThe agitation among A-League club owners for independence to resolve one of those many issues is growing by the minute. \nThe Reality: Will this actually improve the running of the A-League? How will clubs balance self-interest with the great good of the game given that a number of clubs have had difficulties of their own in recent years? It’s a delicate balancing act but, it appears for the first time that their proposals for independence are going to be at least listened to. FFA Chairman Steven Lowy and FFA CEO David Gallop.
