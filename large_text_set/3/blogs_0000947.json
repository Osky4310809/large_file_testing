Close March 3, 2017 \nMercedes-Benz has issued a massive recall affecting more than 354,000 vehicles from the 2015, 2016, and 2017 model years. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, some of those cars may be at risk of catching fire. \nThe problem with the vehicles is electrical in nature and is rooted in the starting current limiter, manufactured by Gruner AG. Like most limiters, this one is designed to manage electrical currents, protecting other components from being damaged and preventing fuse overloads. \nUnfortunately in this case, it's the protector that needs protecting. NHTSA's defect bulletin explains that the limiter in these Mercedes-Benz vehicles isn't designed to handle the heavy current draw that may occur when an engine or transmission is damaged, preventing the car from starting: \"In the event the starter is blocked due to engine/transmission damage (e.g. hydro locked engine), a very high electric current would flow through the starting current limiter during the subsequent start attempt. Should the driver attempt to start the engine repeatedly despite the engine not cranking, the very high electric current draw might lead to overheating of the starting current limiter.\" \nThat overheating can cause nearby components to melt, and in worst-case scenarios, could result in a fire. \nThe list of vehicles included in the recall is long and, thanks to Mercedes-Benz's naming system, a little complicated.
