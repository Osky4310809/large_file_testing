Governor Amosun and the oirganisers \nHe said, “Anyone that violates the rights of women is a criminal, he must be prosecuted. We will not tolerate violence against women. \n“We say capital no to rape, women battery, assault, child abuse and kidnapping of women. Everyday we are witnessing domestic violence against women; women being beaten to a state of coma. This is not right. \n“Women are our wives, they are our daughters and mothers, we must take care of them. When the home is okay, the local government will be okay, when this is okay, state will be okay and the nation will be okay. \n“Thank God our lawmakers are here, they will expedite action on the bill on violence against women. As a government, we will support initiative like this, when there is no violence of any form in the state, investors will come.” \nThe wife of the governor, Mrs. Olufunso Amosun, earlier in her remark, described women as nation builders and must be protected from abuse and violence. \nThe convener of the advocacy walk, Dr Okei-Odumakin, said the walk was to create awareness on violence against women such as rape, battery, domestic violence, assault and other forms of abuses. \nShe said one out of three women in Nigeria suffered abuse and said no fewer than five deaths were recorded in Lagos last year from violence against women.
