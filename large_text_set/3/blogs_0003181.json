Atlanta exciting despite the defeat \nAtlanta United's roster looked good on paper, with exciting young designated players like Miguel Almiron, Josef Martinez and Hector Villalba alongside proven MLS veterans such as Jeff Larentowicz, Tyrone Mears and captain Michael Parkhurst. And under \"Tata\" Martino, the former coach of Barcelona and the Argentina national team, the team also looked good on the field. Games are not played on paper, and newcomers to this parity driven league have historically had a rough time of it in maiden seasons. The last six expansion sides have failed to make the make the playoffs in their first year since the Seattle Sounders did it in 2009. \nEarly in their opener against the Red Bulls, Martino's squad looked like another exception to the rule. In the first half, Atlanta looked faster, sharper and hungrier than the New Yorkers. Some of that surely had to do with the overflow crowd of 55,000 partisan fans who made the atmosphere inside Bobby Dodd Stadium electric. The fact that the visitors were coming off a dispiriting loss to the Vancouver Whitecaps that knocked them out of the CONCACAF Champions League on Thursday and had just flown across the continent to play Atlanta on Sunday probably had something to do with it, too. \nBut Atlanta couldn't maintain the adrenaline or the breakneck speed they showed off during the opening 45 minutes. Martino's team conceded two preventable second-half strikes, including an own goal by defender Anton Walkes, from the re-energized Red Bulls. \nStill, there were some real positives to take away for the hosts. It's not like Yamil Asad's game-winning goal in the 25th minute -- which came off an inch-perfect cross from Mears, who arrived in Georgia fresh after an MLS Cup win with the Sounders last season -- was flukey or against the run of play. Started from a slick volleyed pass from Carlos Carmona, who was sent off late in the second stanza, the sequence was a thing of beauty. Almiron, a 23-year-old Paraguayan playmaker, was everywhere. Atlanta's pace was off the charts. Only a superhuman save from Red Bulls keeper Luis Robles kept the game close before half-time, and had Robles not made another brilliant stop on Almiron just after the hour mark, the outcome may have been different.
