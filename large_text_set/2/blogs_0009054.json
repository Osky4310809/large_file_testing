Or forfeit the remainder of the season?\nThe parents asked the kids. \n\"Is your decision to play the game without the two young ladies on the team, or do you want to stay as a team as you have all year?\" asked parent Matthew Dohn. \"Show of hands for play as a team?\"\nEleven hands shot up in unison.
