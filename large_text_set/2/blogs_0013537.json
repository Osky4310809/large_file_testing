Being one of the greatest rom-coms ever, we’re super ridiculously excited about the Love Actually sequel (even though it’s technically just a 10-minute short film for Comic Relief). We’ve been waiting over 10 years for this!\nAnd after an initial round of casting announcements, it looks like Emma Thompson might return for the Love Actually short ! And to that, we say YES PLEASE. She has to come on board, because basically the whole cast is coming back — Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Thomas Brodie-Sangster (who is now a totally suave grown up FYI), Colin Firth, Liam Neeson — and filming has started!\n❤ Love Actually 2!\nEmma Freud and Richard Curtis give us a little taste of what's to come in the star-studded sequel for comic relief pic.twitter.com/yr6KYWVt8w \n— Victoria Derbyshire (@VictoriaLIVE) February 16, 2017 Speaking to BBC Two’s Victoria Derbyshire about Thompson’s possible involvement, director Richard Curtis was kinda vague. “Oddly, we’re not quite sure [if she’ll be in it]. It’s all been done in a great rush and I think not but I’m now thinking again.” At least…he’s thinking!\nvia GIPHY We sincerely hope that she decides to be involved, because even though her on-screen husband Alan Rickman has passed away (we miss you terribly, Alan), we feel there’s still a lot of emotional exploration to be done with her character.\nvia GIPHY So many freaking epic moments in this movie! \nvia GIPHY AND SO MUCH HEART. Not to mention, dancing!\nvia GIPHY We can’t wait to see it next month as part of the Red Nose Day special (hopefully featuring Emma Thompson…we’re crossing our fingers). And maybe if everything goes well…they might consider an actual full-length movie sequel? Because we can ALWAYS use some more love.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:50:16.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
