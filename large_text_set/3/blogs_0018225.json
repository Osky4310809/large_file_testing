USA TODAY Sports Houston Rockets guard James Harden (13) during the second half against the Denver Nuggets at Pepsi Center. (Photo: Chris Humphreys, USA TODAY Sports) 169 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nUSA TODAY Sports' top five candidates for the 2016-17 NBA MVP award (from Sunday, March 12 through Saturday, March 18). \nAlso receiving votes: Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry, Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo, Washington Wizards' John Wall \n5. Isaiah Thomas, Boston Celtics (44-25) \nSeason statistics: 29.2 points, 6.0 assists, 2.6 rebounds, 0.9 steals, 46.2% shooting \nJust when the Celtics started to slip in the Eastern Conference standings, they put together three straight wins — albeit over Chicago, Minnesota and Brooklyn — and took back second place from Washington. Thomas, dealing with a bone bruise in his right knee, was inactive for the win over Brooklyn, but tallied 22 points (on 9-of-14 shooting) and three steals against Chicago and 27 points (on 8-of-15 shooting) and four assists against Minnesota. Thomas' MVP case isn't nearly as strong as these next four players, but his ascent to the upper echelon of NBA point guards has been one of the league's most intriguing storylines. . @Isaiah_Thomas scores 27 points as the @celtics beat the Timberwolves, 117-104. ☘ pic.twitter.com/rhbpNH9dU6 — NBA TV (@NBATV) March 16, 2017 \n4. Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio Spurs (52-16) \nSeason statistics: 26.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 1.8 steals, 48.5% shooting \nLeonard returned from his one-game absence (concussion protocol) on Monday to record 31 points, five rebounds and four assists and lead the Spurs to a 107-99 win over the Hawks. But then San Antonio, looking to overthrow the Warriors as the No. 1 seed in the West, lost two straight — 110-106 to Portland on Wednesday, 104-96 to Memphis on Saturday. With the MVP race as tight as it is, it's hard to imagine a scenario where Leonard would come out on top if the Spurs don't finish with the league's top record. Kawhi just can't stop dunking! #GoSpursGo pic.twitter.com/7olEPNXoPb \n3. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers (45-23) \nSeason statistics: 26.0 points, 8.8 assists, 8.4 rebounds, 1.3 steals, 54.2% shooting \nLike it or not, James' MVP stock took a hit when he spent Saturday night's nationally-televised game against the Clippers — which the Cavs lost by 30 — on the sidelines. Whether or not it was by choice, whether or not he was \"pissed,\" as Cavs coach Tyronn Lue put it — James can't afford to take nights off while Russell Westbrook and James Harden are both on pace for 82. That said, James, eyeing a fifth MVP award, is in the midst of one of the best statistical seasons of his career, averaging career highs in rebounds (8.4) and assists (8.8), while his field goal percentage (54.3%) and three-point percentage (38.5%) rank third and second, respectively.
