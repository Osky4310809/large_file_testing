Says inauguration photos need to be \"touched up.\" — Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) January 27, 2017 \nKellyanne is a touchy one herself. Hides it better than POTUS, though. Those two, a match made in heaven. — Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) January 26, 2017 \nWhen well intended patriots disagree, that's democracy. When POTUS says it's not fact until he approves it, that's tyranny. — Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) January 26, 2017 \nPOTUS son-in-law tapped as advisor. Appears Kushner's assignment is to advise POTUS how govt can aid Trump Organization's profit margins. — Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) January 27, 2017 \nNobody's really sure who's in charge. POTUS is easily manipulated with smooth compliments. Spkr. Ryan is pulling some strings. — Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) January 26, 2017 \nThe White House is \"a little drab for what I'm used to\" according to POTUS. Been going out of his way to inform folks. — Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) January 26, 2017 \nPOTUS seems to honestly think Putin is his friend. Says Russia will \"fight with us when the time comes\" against Iran. #thatsnothowthisworks — Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) February 2, 2017 \nPOTUS angry at hearing about Arnold S reply to pray-for-ratings dig. \"I won! If I don't know how to be Pres then how come I won?\" — Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) February 2, 2017 \nScariest of all is this reveal that not only did Trump intend for his executive immigration order to be a \"Muslim ban\" — he and Steve Bannon allegedly don't think the controversial act goes far enough! \n\"Ban\" is the exact term used during creation of #MuslimBan Exec. Order. POTUS and Bannon want a stronger ban than final product. https://t.co/Aqk7j0RGS7 — Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) February 1, 2017 \nScary stuff! \nWhat do U think?
