If you want to see it, you'll have to act fast: The bar is only open until April 15. \nAccording to The Washingtonian , in one room of the establishment, sounds of the gaming franchise's theme song fill a space that's decorated with 8-bit Question Blocks, Piranha Plants coming out of Warp Pipes, Starmen, 1-Up Mushrooms, and action figures of Mario and Luigi. The accompanying menu also plays into the theme with cocktails [ PDF ] like “It’s a me, A-Mario,” “ I call Yoshi,” and “Princess In Another Castle,” and snacks [ PDF ] like Marinated Mushrooms and Caprese Grilled Cheese sandwiches. \nOne room over, patrons can find Japanese cherry blossoms, paper cranes, and maneki neko cat figurines in honor of D.C.’s annual Cherry Blossom Festival. They'll also be able to sip on drinks like “1000 Paper Cranes” and snack on items like “Eat, Drink, and Be Cherry.” \n“We wanted to do something that was an homage to Japan and one of its most famous exports: Mario Brothers,” pub owner Derek Brown told local radio station WTOP . “We try to bring out craft spirits, and some of the stuff that people have never seen before, whether it’s sake or Japanese whiskies. But in this incarnation, we get to do it in a way that’s kind of fun and clever.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:22:29.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
