It’s unclear if Chrissy’s feet hurt or if John just wanted a break from the chaos, but the couple took five to chillax right on the red carpet. Twitter \nAre you obsessed or what?! At one point, Chrissy Teigen and John Legend even chatted with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively. Can you think of a foursome better than that? Just @ChrissyTeigen casually sitting on the stairs at the #GoldenGlobes meeting Ryan Reynolds. pic.twitter.com/K7IvAmcVEz \n— E! News (@enews) January 9, 2017 \nIn the clip above, you can see Chrissy and John shaking hands with the “Deadpool” actor. \nYou can also clearly see they’re the only two people sitting down while everyone else is walking up and down the carpet. Twitter went nuts, of course, and dubbed Chrissy Teigen and John Legend the heroes of the night. Twitter Ryan Seacrest even interviewed the couple on the steps because they didn’t feel like getting up. CAN YOU TWO ADOPT ME?! \n— GWoods TV One (@iamgwoods) January 9, 2017 Don’t worry though, the lovebirds did take a few cute photos before they got too comfortable. \n— The Gem Chronicles (@gemchronicles) January 9, 2017 \nJohn looked handsome in a tux and bowtie while Chrissy looked stunning in an embroidered floor-length gown. While people started to tweet pictures of Chrissy sitting on the Golden Globes steps, others reminisced about the hilarious face she got caught making at last year’s ceremony. Hoping for a new @chrissyteigen award show reaction meme tonight #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/s2j4dolLzN \n— niurka marcos (@actuallyamlana) January 9, 2017 \nOh yes, remember that? That face turned into one of the biggest memes of all time. God, I love the internet. \nIt looks like all eyes will be on her tonight to see if she makes any interesting facial expressions on camera. \nHave a great night, you two! I hope the seats inside the theater are just as comfy as those steps. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
