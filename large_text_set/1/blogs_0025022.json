Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nSeems the media has been in hysterics over “evil geniuses” for a lot longer than most people realize. For weeks they have been pushing Bannon as this dark shadow behind the curtain … much like they did with Obama and Jarrett, and Bush and Rove. Nearly every White House is said by media/opponents to have an evil genius who's really in charge. Bush 43:Rove Obama:Jarrett Trump:Bannon. \n— Brit Hume (@brithume) January 30, 2017 \nThink about it. \nThe media always needs some angle to push so people will actually read what they write. It’s far more interesting to read about AN EVIL GENIUS than a guy making decisions based on his campaign promises and the will of the people. \nPsh, process and civics – SO boring. @brithume @AdamBaldwin Weird how 2 out of 3 were/are being attacked while Jarrett mostly got a pass especially from MSM! \nThis is true, Jarrett really only took heat from conservative media, while Rove and clearly Bannon are getting it from all sides. @brithume @AdamBaldwin I heard for Jimmy Carter it was Mr Peanut", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T19:44:06.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
