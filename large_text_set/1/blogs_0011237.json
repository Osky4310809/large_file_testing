Rejuvenation. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) January 14, 2017 \nChelsea ended last season in 10th place with 50 points from 38 games. \nIt has been a different story this term and, although their 13-game winning run was ended at Tottenham in their previous league outing, they were swift to return to winning ways against last season's champions.
