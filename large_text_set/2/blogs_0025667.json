Sousse survivor: 'I popped my head up out of the water. I could see a massacre' Read more \nHundreds of tourists were sunbathing when jihadi Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, killing 38 people, 30 of them British, in a rampage that lasted about 30 minutes. Rezgui was shot dead by Tunisian authorities as he ran from the hotel. \nTui – the travel company that owns Thomson holidays, through which all 30 of the Britons booked their trip – came under significant scrutiny over its handling of Foreign Office travel advice for Tunisia as well as the security at the hotel. \nLawyers representing the families had urged the coroner to rule that neglect played a part in their loved ones’ deaths alongside a conventional finding of “unlawful killing”. \nBut Loraine-Smith told the inquest that legal precedents prevented inquests from applying that conclusion to tourists on holiday because they were not “dependent” on the travel company or hotel. Referring to existing precedents, he said: “They very substantially limit the circumstances in which neglect can feature in the conclusions.” \nThe coroner said he agreed with Tui lawyer Howard Stevens QC that it would be a “quantum leap” in the law to consider the holidaymakers as being “dependent”. \nJudge Loraine-Smith also criticised the police response, describing it as “at best shambolic, at worst cowardly”, and said that officers “could and should have been more effective”. \nThe inquest, which opened at the Royal Courts of Justice in London seven weeks ago, heard emotional and graphic evidence from survivors and relatives of victims. Loraine-Smith will read a summing up on Tuesday morning before delivering his conclusions one by one for each victim. \nThe attack came three months after Islamist militants attacked the Bardo National Museum in the Tunisian capital city of Tunis. They killed 21 people – mostly European tourists – on the spot, and another victim died 10 days later. \nMore details soon....", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:08:05.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
