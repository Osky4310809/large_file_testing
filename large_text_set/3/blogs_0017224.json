During 2011-14, we interviewed 39 young men and women who were the offspring of Jewish and Asian parents. Supporting Mr. Velasquez-Manoff’s point that biracialism breaks down tribalism — and perhaps extending his assertions — our research found that these young people strongly identified both as multiracial as well as Jewish in a surprisingly traditional religious sense. Yet while they told us that they were able to move among many different spheres with ease, they also told us that they were frequently questioned when they entered Jewish spaces because of their nonwhite racial presentation. Thus, as a result of being biracial, they told us that they felt that they had to become “even more Jewish” to demonstrate to their skeptical questioners that they were indeed members of that tribe.
