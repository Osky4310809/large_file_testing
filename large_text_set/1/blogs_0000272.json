Old school \"resolutions\" tend to be general and vague—things like \"lose some weight\" or \"be healthier.\" But often, we don't really set powerful intentions for what we want to experience, feel, and live. And rarely do we put an effective plan in place to make it happen. That's why so many people end up dropping their resolutions before ever seeing the results they want. \nWell, this year is going to be different because you'll have powerful rituals to help you manifest having the abundance, love, and well-being you crave. It starts with getting honest about what you really want. 1. Decide what you want. \nBefore you list the same goals you set every year, take a moment, put your hand on your heart, and ask yourself what you really want. \nDon't just tell me you want \"abundance.\" Tell me how much money, why, by when, and how you would like to receive it. Do you just want happiness, or do you specifically want a new house with more room to creatively express yourself? Do you want to finally find love, or do you really want to get off the dead-end-date carousel and let true love unfold naturally, organically? \nI'm not here to tell you what you should want. Don't let anyone else influence your desires. ADVERTISEMENT \nIf you don't want something so badly that you're willing to do almost anything to get it, you won't ever get it. It has to be a priority. It has to be vivid and real, or you won't put in the time and effort it takes to make your dreams reality. 2. Put your dreams to music. \nTake 10 minutes to create an epic power playlist that speaks (or sings) to the vibes you're trying to create. Want more money? Create a playlist that makes you feel like a million bucks. Want love? Ditch the mopey breakup songs and fill your queue with the stuff that makes your heart pound. \nYour goal is to create a playlist full of anthems to keep you motivated and on track with your goals. So when you start to get off track or lose motivation you have something to re-energize yourself. Music is magical like that. \nPlus, it's a great tool for raising your vibrations and cultivating the energy that will attract your desires to you. 3. Make a plan. \nThis \"ritual\" is less spiritual, more practical, but still super-important.If you want to be successful at anything, make a plan. I'm a huge fan of going with the flow. One of my personal mantras is \"I allow myself to be led.\" Meaning, I give up control, and let the Universe do her thing. But it's important not to confuse that with being passive. It is impossible to control the outcome of everything. But having a plan with small steps that you can take every day increases your chances of success. This is my favorite method for creating an actionable plan. You'll need a notebook for this. First, create a \"big goal.\" \nThis is the overarching theme of the year, or the final result of my actions. Something like, \"by then end of this year, I want to accomplish X.\" Break that goal down into smaller steps that you'll take throughout the year. So every quarter (every three months), what do you need to have accomplished? Write down each step/smaller goal on its own separate page for easy organization. Then break those quarterly goals down even further, into the steps you need to take each month, each week, and each day. \nMaybe you need to wake up 30 minutes earlier every day and meditate. If you have a fitness goal, maybe you need to attend one yoga class a week. If you have a relationship goal, maybe you book one big social event per month. If your goal is to manifest financial abundance, perhaps you need to organize your receipts at the end of each day to keep track of your budget. \nOnce you figure out what your goals are, don't let anything stand in your way of following through. 4. Create an affirmation that'll help you reach your goal(s). \nThis power statement will help you keep your thoughts and emotions positive and focused on your dreams. Affirmations raise your vibes and help you manifest quickly and powerfully. \nIt's simple. Start with the words, \"I am,\" then the sentence by describing the life you want. For example, \"I am financially abundant and have more money at the end of every week than I spend.\" \"I am healthy and make good choices for my body.\" \"I am in love.\" \"I am in a fulfilling relationship.\" \"I am in a career I love.\" Your turn! 5. Create a visual anchor. \nIt's vision board time! Or you can set up an altar if you prefer. Choose a space in your home that you will see every day. Place any images or objects that help you visualize yourself as already living the life you want in this space. This makes your dreams sacred, and, like affirmations, it helps raise your vibes and attract your desires. Don't forget to put your affirmation on it! 6. Make space in your life. \nLook around you. What in your current environment, or lifestyle, is keeping you from your dreams? Do you want to get healthy but have a refrigerator full of junk food? Are you trying to attract your true love but still going on dates you're not excited about? Do you want to manifest financial abundance but have a purse full of receipts for items that you didn't want or need? Clear away the clutter that reminds you of the \"old you\" and fill your space with things that welcome and honor the \"new you.\" Put some veggies in the crisper, delete that dating app that depresses you, and get a new wallet that represents your wealthy self. You get the idea. Bonus points for lighting up the sage and smudging that old energy away. 7. Make space in your brain. \nThis is a perfect time to start meditating. Meditation helps you declutter your mind and release old thought patterns. Your ego gets quieter, and your affirmations get louder. Which thoughts do you want occupying your mental space? Meditation helps you choose your thoughts and take back your manifesting power. If you need to revive your meditation practice, try this . 8. Start a gratitude journal. \nYour first entry? All the amazing things you've already accomplished! Celebrate every win—big or small—that got you to where you are today. Gratitude attracts more blessings. It's a win-win. The more you think and feel it, the more you experience it. Why not practice holding the energy of gratitude once a day? Keeping a daily gratitude journal is a very powerful and joyful way to do just that. 9. Shout it from the rooftops. \nSound scary? It can be! We often fear judgment from friends and family or embarrassment if we don't achieve the goals we've set. But I want you to challenge yourself. I'm willing to bet you'll receive love and support from the people in your life when you do. Ignore the haters and instead focus on the people who love and support you. (This might be an opportunity to clean up your social media feeds if you've got more naysayers than supporters.) \nAnnouncing your intentions makes you accountable. And when you have people praying for you, visualizing your success, and believing that you can and will do something, your own manifesting work becomes that much more potent. 10. Find a tribe and/or accountability partner. \nEven the most well-meaning friends won't necessarily \"get you\" or be able to offer advice that's actually helpful. In order to really feel supported, seek out a like-minded community or an accountability partner who is on a similar path. Online groups and forums are great, but I also urge you to make in-person connections with someone in your city, so you can develop a real and lasting relationship that will benefit you both. Going to the gym? Find a buddy who has similar fitness goals. Set a weekly budget with your significant other to help save money. Check in with your accountability partner every week or even every day if you want. Make an appointment with them and keep it. 11. Take one small step a day. \nOnce you do all of the above, you'll have lots of energy and momentum toward your goals. Now it's time to harness that energy before it dissipates and the enthusiasm abates. \nSo, check your daily action plan. What is one thing you can do today to work toward your goal(s)? If this feels daunting, take one step a day for the next 11 days, and then see how you feel. \nBut pick one thing to do before this day is over and actually do it. Then share that success story with someone, because taking that first step is often the hardest. It's a major win that should be celebrated. \nI hope this serves you well. Feel free to come back to it every year or whenever you have a major manifesting goal. I wish you great success and a happy New Year!
