Count us in. #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/B6mhFiUx1T \n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 8, 2017 \nThe Settlers of Catan is a multiplayer board game (think Monopoly) where players assume roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources.\n“If anybody knew what was up, they’d all be playing a game night as well,” Bell said, while Shepard added they will probably be wearing onesies while playing.\nThe game might sound innocent enough, but Bell quipped that Catan has ruined relationships.\n“It causes riffs, it’s broken friendships,” she joked. “We fight when we play it.”\nIf they do fight, it doesn’t show. The couple, who’ve been married for three years and together for nine, recently spent a romantic holiday together at California’s Mammoth Mountain.\n“I met the hottest guy on the slopes today, and promptly made out with him,” Bell wrote on Instagram.\nShepard also posted the photo, writing, “It’s hot as hell outside.”\nThey share two daughters: Lincoln, 3 &frac12;, and Delta , 2.\nThis article first appeared on People.com. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T03:58:34.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
