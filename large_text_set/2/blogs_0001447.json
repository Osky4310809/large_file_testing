Because new flagship phone releases almost always come to a stand still during these times, we often get to settle in to a phone and truly get to know it. Instead of jumping from one phone to the next to get the next review out, this is a time where we get to become somewhat of a consumer. It’s kind of fun, actually! \nAs you can tell from the title, the Google Pixel (the regular, smaller one) has been in my pocket, by my side since I reviewed it back at the end of October. This is the phone that most fits my needs. \nIn the video review below, I dive into those needs, what I still like about the Pixel, and why it’s the phone for me at this time. Things like the size, software experience, camera, and ability to use it on any carrier are the highlights. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t still some issues. For example, the design isn’t impressing me yet, the choice to go with 32GB storage was probably a bad one, and the rapid charging just isn’t as good as the solutions from companies like OnePlus. \nHow about you? How has the Pixel or Pixel XL held up for you the past few months? Post navigation Next Story Instagram Testing Multi-Photo Albums in Version 10.7.0 Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nThat’s all cool and everything, but no one can even buy an XL, so I’m not sure that it matters. I certainly wouldn’t wait until March for one, even if I wanted one. JSo \nI have a 5X but am really looking forward to the second generation Pixel. I’ll most likely be upgrading then. Hopefully the design is a little better. But I’ll probably get it regardless. Godzilla \nTo me its the best phone ever made. The camera cant be surpassed, maybe tied by samsung, but not surpassed. The snapiness and user experience is the fastest ever and most consistent. Ive lost NO speed with this phone. Also knowing that i am on top of the android updates is a huge win and also participating in the BETA program. This phone has convinced me to never touch samsung again (unless they make a pixel) and to only buy unlocked phones from google for now on. Even if you have to wait forever. Orlando aka Pixel XL \nStill loving it and all 128 GB..I love that they teamed up ubreakifix because I cracked my back housing and changed the color. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1900c6db77c07e2caec038096bc525b6398489cdee92c881d5576ecf62b88c30.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ade8fbbf5c1b07409d3c726257e1e76ccdc5316266875eb53683e4216c4e2e7f.jpg AxemRed \nI’m mostly happy with the Pixel. The performance is fantastic, but there are two bugs that are killing me. One is that band 4 issue that was reported early on. Would you be surprised to know that it isn’t fixed yet? Because it’s not. There’s an area near my house where my phone is unusable unless I’m on Wifi. The phone constantly establishes a signal and then drops to nothing. The February release will supposedly fix it, so I’m keeping my fingers crossed. The other issue is with bluetooth, specifically with car syncing. My mom can’t make calls through her car’s system. It’s not something obscure or outdated either, it’s a 2016 Accord. There is a thread on the Google Product forums hundreds of posts long of people losing their minds. That too will supposedly be fixed this month. After dealing with this since launch, I’ve come to the conclusion the monthly updates still make Google no more speedy at fixing bugs than Samsung. Guest \nI want a pixel XL and will probably get one later in the year when the price drops. Not sure about anyone else but these prices are nuts for a phone. I got a mint S7E for cheeeeap (first non Nexus in ever) for Verizon and flashed the U software to get hotspot for my UDP. Shawn Spring \nThe Pixel and XL are simply a great first foray for Google into the hardware game. They got right what people want most (battery life, camera, screen) and the niggles are things (like water resistance) that can be solved in other ways (w/cases) – really looking forward to Pixel 2 rumors and launch. \nHappy Pixel XL owner here. Justin Martin \nBullet proof from day one. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nAlso for folks looking for a device now… Are you willing to wait for LG and Samsung (almost 3 months away for Samsung) or are you pulling the trigger on a Pixel now? Josh LaCelle \nWaiting for the S8. I can’t bring myself to buy the Pixel. It looks so outdated! Godzilla \nI will never consider a none google phone again. Unless its pure stock android with a proven update consistency. DanSan \nStill using my N6, decided to skip the N6P and see what got released after. I was very much disappointed with the Pixel and won’t pay the price google is asking. As much as I hate to say it, im grabbing a GS8 when it gets released. \nmy first non-google phone in a long long time. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nWhat’s up with the Bluetooth issues I keep hearing about? And did 7.1.2 fix it? \nAnd is that the only chronic issue folks are having? Godzilla \nNo issues here so far Bob Allen \nI didn’t intend on getting the Pixel – I wanted the Pixel XL. But I’ve found myself really happy with the 128 GB model of the Pixel even though it’s smaller than I like some days. It’s still fast and easy and I’ve had no software hiccups with it. I put mine in a case so the bland design doesn’t bother me much and I’m just not seeing anything out there coming up that really beats it in the near future. With Samsung, TouchWhiz is still a deal breaker for me and I liked my Moto Z Force, but the camera just isn’t in the same league. Sakeem \nSo far so good with my Pixel XL. No slowdowns, no random reboots……working the same as when I first took it out the box and fired it up for the first time. Bluetooth has been fine so far as well. Best phone i’ve used so far. Francesco Vaccarella \nSame here, using my Pixel XL. Amazing camera, i’m getting 5/6 hours of sot every day. The software experience is so smooth. Best smartphone I’ve ever owned and that’s ever been made. Kudos Google. trixnkix637 \nPixel XL. Best phone I’ve ever had. Beats the love I have for the OG Moto X. Never thought I’d have a Google phone from Verizon again, but never say never. \nOnly thing I don’t like is how careful I have to be with it because the backorders for a replacement phone are months out. Christian Trevor Clauss \n3 Months Later: Still in back order. Chad \n3 months later… and i’m still on Google’s waiting list for a XL 128 Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nWorked for the 6P madness. And works just as well for the Pixel. That Google wait list doesn’t work. Godzilla \nYou have to actually log into the store every day and go for it, the wait list e mails are hours behind actual releases N8dogg \nI like my Pixel XL, but having issues with bluetooth. Doesn’t always connect to Chevy’s Mylink all the time. Anyone else having bluetooth issues? trixnkix637 \n*knocks on wood* I never have. Guest \nThere’s your problem…Chevy. N8dogg \nHa! Wifes car and she has a Samsung S7, connects just fine. I am a Ford guy myself… But not much better connecting those either! Godzilla \nprobably the car, not the phone. Jesse \nWhich major phone has been released since October that the Pixel has beaten out? PuttsMoBilesiCit \nThere hasnt been anything lol… Eric \nWith the Note 7 fiasco, it was a pretty stale late 2016 for Android releases. Nobody should be surprised by the Pixel still being the favorite phone. gpzbc \nAny thoughts on Pixel vs Pixel XL? I’m in the market and will probably pull the trigger as soon as they are in stock again. PuttsMoBilesiCit \nSame internal specs. Only real difference is size, battery and screen. trixnkix637 \nGo with the XL if you don’t mind the size. Bigger battery, better screen, and works best with the Daydream VR set. Joey Riz \nSmaller Pixel for me as well. Fits all of my needs completely. Add water resistants next year and I will be all set \nMy Bluetooth randomly shuts off sometimes, but other than that I’m happy with my purchase. NeilOMalley \nStill loving my Pixel XL. Best phone I’ve ever used. Getting great battery life, performance has been outstanding, camera has captured some amazing photos. Overall I have had no issues with it.
