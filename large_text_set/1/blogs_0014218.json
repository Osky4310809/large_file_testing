You’ll also find that the collection offers an array of casual and daily wear-friendly options, such as shirts, crewnecks, drawstring bags, and totes.\nThe new Mark Gonzales collection is now available at select United Arrows and Beauty & Youth retail locations in Japan.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:20:50.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
