I learned that in football any situation can change in 24 hours. \n\"The problem wasn't with me, it was with him, and he never came to terms with it. I don't know what his problem was with me. \n\"It is something that drives me, gives me adrenaline and extra motivation. It is normal after what has happened. I'm using it as a positive, not negative.\" Zlatan Ibrahimovic said he was using the row as 'a positive, not a negative.' \nUnited travel to the Etihad Stadium on April 27 for what could potentially be a decisive clash in the battle for a top four place. \nBut former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson believes the club should prioritise winning the Europa League to secure a Champions League place. \nUnited are favourites to win the one major European title they have never claimed and take on Anderlecht in the quarterfinals. \nFerguson told ESPN FC : \"The thing is, we've never won the Europa League. We've never won [the] UEFA Cup, which is what it used to be. \n\"And we've got a great draw. I'm not saying it's a certainty, but they've got a great chance. \n\"If you win a trophy, it's important. It doesn't matter that it's not the Champions League -- it's still a European trophy. \n\"And if you win it, you get into the Champions League. The incentive is greater to do that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:57:57.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
