Desperate times call for desperate measures, and so Simmons and Quake hack their way into the Framework and possess their own digital avatars. \nThe audience follows them into the framework and finds the digital world is full of surprises. Daisy is apparently with Grant Ward, who is very much still alive. Simmons, on the other hand, is dead and Fitz is living the life of the super rich with another woman. Mack lives in the suburbs with his family. \nOne of the biggest shockers is that Hydra is alive and well in the Framework. In the Framework, Hydra has gone public and their logo can be seen clearly on the side of a building. What’s more, Melinda May is now apparently a happy agent of Hydra. \nMay being an agent of Hydra is quite a shocker considering Aida supposedly fixed her greatest regret in order to let her live a happy life. Aida already discovered that May craves action and conflict and will reject the Framework as unreal if she doesn’t experience it, but why not just let her continue to be an agent of SHIELD? \nMore Marvel's Agents of SHIELD news: Showrunner Teases Graviton's Return / What Will The Final Pod Be About? / No New Episodes Until April \nThat may come down to Phil Coulson’s biggest regret. It is hinted at in the episode that Coulson may wish he had never joined SHIELD and that he had been able to live a quiet life with a normal family. This is backed up by Coulson’s experience in the framework, where he is a school teacher. Perhaps the Framework simply simulated what would have happened if Coulson had never joined SHIELD and came to the conclusion that Hydra would have taken over from within and began operating in the public eye. \nThis seems to suggest that Daisy and Ward are also working for Hydra. We’re sure to learn more about the world of the Framework when Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD returns from hiatus in April.
