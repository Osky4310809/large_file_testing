To no one’s surprise, the “father of Proton” is against the idea of ceding control of the carmaker to foreign parties, even blaming the current PM for Proton’s predicament. \nNow, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak has aired his thoughts on the matter, defending the government’s proposal for Proton to have a foreign partner. Proton must look for a strategic partner, but this does not mean the company is being sold to foreigners, he said, reported by The Star . \n“This (finding a partner) is so there will be an injection of new technology and a larger market. When there is a larger volume of sales, there will be more jobs in Pekan and Tanjung Malim. The people are the ones who will benefit from this,” Najib reasoned at the opening of the Negaraku: Komuniti 1Malaysia programme in Pekan over the weekend. \n“We do not play using emotions and fake news. We do what is best for the people,” he added, saying that a former leader had committed many mistakes in the handling of Proton. “I do not want to talk about it, but we want to fix it,” the PM said. \nFor a recap of the current situation and Tun M’s views on the matter, click here .
