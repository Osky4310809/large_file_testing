Proud Democrat. Mayor of Tallahassee and candidate for FL Governor. Working w/ you to rebuild a state that works for all of us. Mar 12 Our strategy to win in 2018 There is a debate in our party right now about whether or not we as Democrats should talk to working-class white voters or double down on our base. And let me tell y’all, it is asinine. The truth is we ought to be talking to working-class black voters, working-class white voters, working-class Latino voters, all working class voters. Our opportunity for a victory here in Florida isn’t hidden in some specific demographic that we need to target, but rather in demonstrating to all Floridians that we have the best plan to move our state forward. Our strategy is to not only go speak in all 67 counties in Florida — it’s to listen in all 67 counties, too. Will you help us build a movement that reaches every corner of Florida by contributing $20.18 to our campaign right now? Now, this kind of strategy means there will be times when we’re campaigning in towns that haven’t gone blue once in my lifetime. But whether we’re speaking with folks in a small town up in the Panhandle, or a big city down in South Florida, I can promise you that our message will be the same. We’re going to talk about the need to create jobs on every rung of the income ladder, so that every Floridian can get a job that doesn’t require them to have three jobs. About finally giving teachers the pay raise they deserve, and getting rid of the high stakes testing that leaves our kids sick to their stomachs with anxiety. About protecting Planned Parenthood and expanding access to health care. About fulfilling the promise that we are ALL created equal, no matter our race, religion, creed, ability, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, or what’s in our bank account. We’re not going to water down our message or compromise our progressive principles based on some superficial differences. And we don’t need to — because these ideas aren’t just appealing in communities like the one I grew up in. These ideas are appealing in any community where there are folks who believe we need to level the playing field, provide better job and education opportunities, treat our neighbors with more kindness and compassion, and rebuild this state into a better place for all of us. Help us fund our movement to reach voters across the state, regardless of their background, by contributing $20.18 to our campaign today. Together, we will build the kind of campaign that the entire state can be proud of, that stands up for every Floridian, that gives hope to every person and every family regardless of their background. Together, we will build a campaign that will win back the Governor’s Mansion after more than 20 long years.
