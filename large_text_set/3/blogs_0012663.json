The partnership’s announcement included a showcase of this initial vehicle managing a closed road course, with no one behind the wheel. \nPACCAR is an industry leader that already produces many of the trucks that make up global logistics fleets, but other startups including Uber-owned Otto and Embark are also racing to address this market. There’s a lot of interest in pushing autonomous driving tech forward in this industry because it has tremendous cost-saving potential in terms of increasing the amount of time trucks can spend on the road, and reducing fatalities related to human-caused accidents. \nIn aggregate, all of the deals Nvidia is securing to provide the computing horsepower needed to make autonomous vehicles a reality represent a significant strengthening of tis long-term position, as demand for self-driving is likely to only grow over the next couple of decades at least. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T16:53:29.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
