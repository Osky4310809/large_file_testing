Peace out Boston.” \nThe post was deleted after several hours, but not before stirring up speculation that the New England Patriots might be trading their coveted backup quarterback. \nHowever, Garoppolo’s agent finally told media members later Friday that the player’s account had been hacked and the post was a hoax. Don Yee, agent for #Patriots QB Jimmy Garoppolo, says: \"Jimmy's social media account was hacked.\" \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 10, 2017 \nFOX Sports NFL insider Peter Schrager, meanwhile, told Mike Francesa on WFAN that all indications point to the Pats keeping Garoppolo. \n“(Bill) Belichick looks at this way — and this is how I was explained it: He wants to win in 2017. He doesn’t really concern himself with 2018, 2019. It’s year to year. And right now, Garoppolo, to them, is the most valuable player in the league because he’s $1 million, and they can always franchise him after next year,” Schrager said Friday. \n“Brady’s 39 years old. You want to say he’s in incredible shape and he doesn’t eat strawberries and all that? That’s great. If Brady goes down, they’re much more comfortable with a guy who’s been in the system for three years in Garoppolo than (Jacoby) Brissett, who they like.” \nThe Cleveland Browns, who have stockpiled a staggering amount of picks in the next two drafts , have been reported to have interest in making an offer for Garoppolo. But there reportedly had been no trade talks as of Friday morning when the Instagram post went up. I'm told that there are \"no trade talks\" for Jimmy Garoppolo and the #Browns going on, at this time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:52:33.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
