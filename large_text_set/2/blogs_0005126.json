I'm one of 100 million #SuperBowl fans that just went #Gaga for the Lady, & her message to all of us. https://t.co/8AoNqjwr1b \n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 6, 2017 \nPro-tip: Hillary, if you don’t put a clear message out there, people aren’t going to see it and maybe it isn’t really there. \nYou should understand that by now. \nYou didn’t have a message apart from, “Elect me, it’s my time” and “The other guy is awful.” \nYou had to get people to paint you as more than you were just as you are trying to paint Gaga’s performance as something more than it was. \nNot buying it…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:31:26.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
