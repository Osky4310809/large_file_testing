That made her win for Best Actress in a Television Series Comedy that much sweeter. During her speech, the Black-ish star dedicated the honor to women of color. \"This is for all of the women, women of color, and colorful people, whose stories, ideas, thoughts, are not always considered worthy and valid and important. But I want you to know that I see you. We see you,\" she said. \"It is an honor to be on this show, Black-ish , to continue expanding the way we are seen and known, and to show the magic and the beauty and the sameness of a story and stories that are outside of where the industry usually looks.\"   \"I don't know who else there is [to thank] other than the amazing people who have brought me here in my careerâ€“ It's nice at 44!\" continued the actress, who has been acting since 1996. Ross is the first black woman to win in this category since Debbie Allen for Fame in 1983. Allen gave her a special shout-out shortly after: Congrats Issa & Tracee on well-deserved @goldenglobes nominations! Win-win either way! #tbt last time a black woman won this category ;) pic.twitter.com/FupdxtoyPL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T04:25:05.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
