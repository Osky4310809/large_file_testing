With Laurel & Wolf, you fill out the profile based on your style, then they match you with a designer. Both were quite involved and we felt like they were trying to 'get to know us.' Homepolish on the other hand was extremely fast; they seem to rely mostly on the matchmaking process and then letting the designer figure out the rest from the initial consultation.\" A detail from the dining room. (Image credit: Carina Romano ) \nAfter being matched with their designers at each company, Vijay & Anita completed initial consultations, taking notes along the way. \n\"Both Laurel & Wolf and Havenly were similar in that the first step was awaiting the designer to create some loose 'mood boards' of your space based on the information you filled out in the profile,\" says Anita and Vijay. \"This was definitely one of the most telling signs of the process because it's how you know whether the person you're working with is able to turn your words into reality. It's also the basis from which you start to give all of your feedback. After you receive the mood boards, you're encouraged to give a lot of feedback on what you like, what you don't like, and why, including specific pieces you may like or not like.\" \n\"Homepolish on the other hand is very different. Instead of everything being done electronically, it is more of a match-making service. The nice part about this is that they match you with a local designer and send them to your house for a one-hour free consultation. This is great because you can meet the designer in person and have them experience your space in real life. However, the service itself is actually very different than Havenly and Laurel & Wolf. Based on the assumed needs of your project, Homepolish sells you a package of 'hours' at a set rate (that we were told was less than what a typical interior designer would cost). You can use these hours however you want—have them do research, go shopping with you, etc. and you can use their trade discount. However, it's not as electronic or affordable of a process by any means.\" \nNow comes the fun part: reviewing the design recommendations!
