I’m not sure of the status yet, but it will be implemented by this year. Recipients will be able to utilise BR1M, and it will help those from the B40 group to achieve income that would put them in the M40 group,” he said. \nUnder the plan, those in the B40 group (those with a household income of up to RM3,855) will be able to make a downpayment for a vehicle using BR1M money , and a rebate of RM4,000 will be provided for the purchase of a Proton Iriz.
