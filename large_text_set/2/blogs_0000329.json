First came Full House , then Gilmore Girls , and pretty soon we’ll have a new Charmed and Will and Grace . In the spirit of the recent reboot rejuvenation of Tinseltown, here are six CW shows that we really need rebooted. 1. Gossip Girl \nvia GIPHY \nIt only ended in 2012, yet life feels impossibly empty without Gossip Girl . Now that we know Dan’s the one who’s been signing off \"you know you love XOXO\", we want to see what life’s like five years into Serena and Gossip Girl’s marriage. We’re assuming they move to LA and open up a fledgling TMZ-like site, spending their nights prowling LA hotspots for (cold-pressed) juice-y stories. Chair (Chuck and Blair, obviously) are notably missing from the reboot ‘cuz Leighton isn’t an “actress\" anymore (a la the Olsen twins) and Ed is just well... what’s Chuck without Blair? 2. One Tree Hill \nvia GIPHY \nWe need, nay, deserve a One Tree Hill reboot. This was the classic story of two half brothers who's basketball rivalry is a metaphor for their real life struggle to find validation from their smooth-talking car-salesman slash murderer dad. Very relatable. In all seriousness, we love the show. The storylines all wrapped up quite nicely, with everyone paired off and making babies. The One Tree Hill reboot would probably be done with all new characters like Beverly Hills, 90210 , and the Scott bros would randomly drop in with their lovely-- women. (You thought I’d say hoes, for shame!) 3. Smallville \nvia GIPHY \nWe just want Tom Welling and his baby blues back in our lives. Oh and Kristin Kreuk is original bae. In our ideal reboot, Clark and Lana would still be in high school even though they looked thirty. The first reboot episode would explain their mature looks by showing Clark and Lana at The Talon angstily sharing a bagel that is made of toxic gluten!! The gluten turned them old!! 4. Buffy the Vampire Slayer \nvia GIPHY \nTechnically, Buffy was on The WB and then UPN, but The WB and UPN merged to become The CW, so it totally works! Buffy aired from 1997 until 2003 — centuries ago for the Twitbook/ Snapgram generation. That’s just another reason it needs a reboot DESPERATELY. If you’ve never heard of Buffy , let me give it to you quick: it's Twilight but Bella’s an ass-kicking boss. 5. Sabrina the Teenage Witch \nvia GIPHY \nPlease indulge this 25-year-old fossil of a Smosh writer and pretend you’ve heard of Sabrina the Teenage Witch . Oh, you have? Well gosh darn, slap me on the belly and call me Santa! (I don’t know what that was about.) In the Sabrina reboot, Salem would be in human form, be played by Benedict Cumberbatch, and it. Would. Be. Beautiful. 6. Summerland \nvia GIPHY \nSummerland only aired for one season and certainly didn’t change the world with its soapy depiction of California beach life. But it did feature baby Zac Efron before the High School Musicals and DJing for Emily Ratajkowski. We love circa 2004 Efron! The Summerland reboot would definitely feature Zac Efron reprising his role as Cameron Bale alongside other white people with lovely white names like Jay Robertson and Bradin Westerly. \nWhat show do you want to see rebooted so you can pick it apart and use its lifeless carcass as fodder for your dank gif game?
