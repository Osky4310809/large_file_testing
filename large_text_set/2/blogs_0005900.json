We saw 'Sulky-face Trump' during the debates with Clinton and now that stormy face has reappeared, along with a desire to hold hands with his wife. \nYou can tell when Donald is not getting his way. The mouth clamps shut with the corners turned down and the chin pulled up, while his eyes lose that quasi-paternal crinkle that implies he is in total control as a leader, to take on a much colder look. US President Donald Trump's wife stays by his side (Photo: Getty Images) \nSulking is great when you're nine years old, and because it is a relatively effective way of manipulating a transaction so that you sometimes do get your own way in terms of Xmas presents and treats it is often the weapon of choice of adults too. \nWho hasn't worked with the colleague or boss who sits in stony silence with a face like thunder, replying 'I'm fine' when asked if they're alright until the rest of the workforce buckles and gives in? \nAnd who hasn't seen the less-than-happy partner whose spouse adopts the 'smiling-by-proxy' look that Melania seems to be doing here? While Trump appears to show his displeasure in a way that would defy anyone to tell him to 'Hey, turn that frown upside down Donald!' his wife takes hold of his hand and comes forward to do all his smiling for him. Her eyes and teeth gleam and she is suddenly a very important part of the visual double-act again.
