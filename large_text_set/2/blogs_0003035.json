And if someone had told me that the teenager who followed us around would go on to carve out the career he has...well, I wouldn’t have believed them. \nLampard has come a long way since then, establishing himself as a legend for both Chelsea and England. \nBut the real beauty of Lampard’s career was the clinical approach he took to lift himself to the very top of his profession. \nFor a player who was very good at most things, the Londoner stood tallest when it came to goalscoring. None of the so-called Golden Generation came close to matching him in the priceless art of finding the net. Frank Lampard during his days at West Ham \nDavid Beckham may have supplied more assists. Paul Scholes might have been a better passer, and Steven Gerrard a better all-round player. \nBut none of them approached the game with Lampard’s cold steel. And got a comparable return in front of goal. \nThe only player I believe you can ­compare him with is Liverpool great Kevin Keegan. The Kop idol was very similar to the ­Chelsea midfielder in the way he squeezed every last drop out of his talent. \nKeegan was a supreme athlete who worked out what he needed to do to succeed. And then he set about giving himself the best chance of achieving all he could in the game through hard work.

Read More John Terry insists he will not be following Frank Lampard into retirement \nHe understood that there was a value in scoring goals. And he worked tirelessly on his finishing – particularly from outside the box. \nLampard’s was no God-given talent. It was earned through graft. And how fortunate was he to have someone around like his old fella, Frank Senior, to guide him. Lampard during his time in New York (Photo: GETTY) \nMy mum, rather than my dad, was the major influence on my career. She was the one who dropped me off to trials at Walsall and training at Stafford Rangers in the ­early days. \nAs helpful as that was, I would love to have been able to get feedback from ­someone like Frank Senior. \nHow good it must have been for young Frank to say: ‘What do you think?’­­whenever a problem arose. But it is one thing being told the ­answer to a question. It’s another one altogether to act upon it.

But he chose to go to Chelsea. And as hard as that has been for West Ham fans to truly accept, it was the right move. \nThe only subject for debate is whether England could have got more out of him. \nWhen I was around the national team, the ­attitude was that the likes of Lampard, Gerrard, Beckham and Scholes were good enough to work it out for themselves. \nOne thing’s for sure, if all of England’s squad had shown Frank Lampard’s dedication to becoming the best they could be, perhaps that Golden Generation might have delivered.
