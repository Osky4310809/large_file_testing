After facing strong opposition, the forced de-encryption of messages wasn’t included as part of that legislature, but Rudd has refused to rule out the possibility that it would now be added. Rudd did, however, say that she would try to win-over tech companies without resorting to new legislature.\n“These people have families, have children as well,” she said. “They should be on our side, and I’m going to try to win that argument.”\nSee also: Simple text statuses are coming back to Whatsapp 2 weeks ago Critics have said Rudd’s proposal would be ineffective and “make millions of ordinary people less secure online.”\nWhatsApp, meanwhile, has said that it was “horrified” by the London attack and that it is “cooperating with law enforcement” on the matter.\nWhere do you stand on the end-to-end encryption?
