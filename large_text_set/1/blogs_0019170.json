You can’t keep desperately searching for the rewind button, because that’s just not how this works.\nYou have to indirectly erase him from your life.\nWash him out of your clothes.\nSweat him out at the gym.\nBrush him out of your hair.\nWrite him out of your journal.\nShaming yourself and wishing for things to be different will not change the circumstances. This pain, anguish, and misery shouldn’t be the reality of anyone, but it is. Do you want to know why? Because, this is what life is all about. You have to experience darkness to be able to appreciate the light.\nWant to know something else? You will be okay. Life isn’t over and the world is still spinning. That doesn’t mean that life won’t be different, because it will be much different, but is different a bad thing?\nNo.\nThis means you have the opportunity to get creative with your existence. “When one door closes another door opens.” It’s so cliché, but it’s so true. New doors won’t open if you’re constantly trying to open that locked door. Leave it. There are so many doors that will lead you to new destinations, friendships, and maybe even a new love. These doors may even make you laugh about how you doubted yourself in the first place.\nOnce you’re able to separate the past from the future you’ll be able to live, and I mean really live. You’ll find new strengths and you’ll learn new things about yourself that you didn’t even know you had in you. You can’t ever go back and change what has been done, but you do have a choice every single day to be the person you are now. Get unique with your self-care and start falling madly in love with you.\nHappiness means some heartbreak, light means some darkness, and good means some bad, but your journey isn’t over. You have right now to make your time here worth it. Challenges and struggle will always occur, but there is always always always be a way. You have to get uncomfortable to be comfortable.\nI believe in you. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T22:06:04.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
