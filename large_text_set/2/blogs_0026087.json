We should all be so lucky as to have a love like Warren and Annette's. Because that's what you do when you really love someone. You stand by them, stick up for them, help them, learn from them. Or, in the case of Nick Viall, listen to them politely. \nDamn you, The Bachelor . I can't get away from this show. Here are the most important Nick Viall-related news items of the week: He is friends with Frodo/Kid from Flipper /the other Daniel Radcliffe, actor Elijah Wood , and he's not wearing a Livestrong bracelet after all . Good to know. \nFrom last week , you may remember that we have four women left—including Rachel, the Bachelorette , so really, three—all of whom L-U-V him. Also, Andi Dorfman has returned to stir shit up because I guess she had nothing else to do. Now, I didn't see Andi's season so I don't know everything about their backstory/dynamic, but I don't like her as much as I like any of the women Nick currently has his pick of, and that includes Corinne. Speaking of Corinne , she is wearing an outfit that can only be described as \"what Samantha Jones would for sure be wearing.\" \nI hate that they're all saying they're ready to get married. Being in love I understand; love is irrational and spontaneous and strange. Marriage is a legal thing. Think it through! To his credit, Nick tells Andi that he's not going to get engaged just because he's The Bachelor . \n(I have to say, the ad for \"Pandora\" world at Disney World really bums me out. Has James Cameron actually watched Avatar recently? Does he accurately remember what Avatar is? It's not that good, y'all. Disney World could have used that space and money to build a rollercoaster version of the warehouse of doors from Monster's, Inc that you could ride on and take to other dimensions. I think it would be fun! Disney, please do this.) \nAndi goes on a \"feminist rant\" about how adults are allowed to have consensual sex together. Huzzah! Equality between the sexes achieved! Cancel that strike ladies, we good. OK, Anna has just informed me that Andi was slut-shamed during her season after Nick revealed on After the Final Rose that they had sex in the fantasy suite. Good context, makes more sense. I'm glad Nick apologized. I apologize, too. Now we know why Andi showed up! To fix that thing so we can be 100% on Nick's side forever! Good call, producers. \nAt the windy rose ceremony, Nick sends Corinne home. Corinne, baby, stop crying. Go spread your wings and fly! Become an Instagram model so I can hate-follow you; start a lifestyle blog I can mock but also read every day; write a book about sex and shopping I can buy for all my friends but also for myself. You're free, white, and 21 (well, 25), your life is a buffet of possibility and privilege. Go sleep like the sleepy puppy you are! Corinne is spitting some pseudo-empowerment nonsense in the limo about how she's done trying to impress a man. Easy to say once you're been kicked off of the show where that is the premise. \nNext up: We're in Finland! Raven has never told a man she loved him (not even the ex she attacked with a shoe), but more importantly, a man has never made her orgasm (even the one she attacked with a shoe). Sucks to be Raven's ex watching her tell the whole world you were unable to bring her to completion. Then again, let's not put a finish line on the sexual experience, right? Things can be pleasant without being explosive; should we take a quick course about the wide range of experiences that comprise human sexuality? No? OK, back to The Bachelor . \nPlaying darts at a pub, Nick picks Raven up and runs her into the wall. She dies, RIP Raven. JK! Raven repeats that she is a \"daddy's girl,\" Nick says he likes a woman with a big personality. Then, Raven and Nick (\"Rick\") equitably divide their potential future domestic duties: He will cook, she will do the laundry. But first, they're gonna bone! \n\"Today's the day.\" - Raven \nRaven's ex only told her he loved her when he was drunk but never sober and they dated like two years. RED FLAG. \n“The way that I feel about you, I never felt about [my ex].” - Raven, greatly relieving Nick, who will probably not be almost-murdered with a shoe tonight. Probably. \nRaven talks about wanting an “easy” love, by which she doesn’t mean simple or shallow but pure and positive. It’s easy to be good to someone who is good to you, easy to be with someone you like being around, easy to love someone lovable. Well, f-ck me! Raven with the wisdom! \n“That’s one of the best professions of love I think I’ve ever heard.” - Nick, but also America \nNick's cozy turtleneck is very J.Jill catalogue, IMO. Raven and Nick are having such a frank talk about their sexual histories (Raven's been with one guy and one guy only) it’s honestly...inspiring? I’m proud? We should all be so forthright? \nOff to the fantasy suite to attempt mutual orgasms they go; we know Nick isn't bad in bed, considering Liz (WHO SLEPT WITH HIM AT JADE AND TANNER'S WEDDING, IN CASE YOU FORGOT), came back for seconds. \nAnd then for some reason the episode is over and Chris Harrison is telling us about a mega-episode next week, full of cat fights and hot tubs. And now When We Rise is on, reminding me that millions of people were allowed to die because of who they loved. Kinda puts the whole thing in perspective. \nNow, friends, before you go all in on Raven's sexual history (or lack thereof), let me remind you that it's totally normal and not weird to have trouble figuring out how to have orgasms ( here's some tips! ), and that a person can live a full life without them . I mean, they're great, don't get me wrong. I just don't like it when we judge others and call them broken because of how easily they climax. RANT OVER. LOVE YOU TOO. \nParting Thoughts: Next week the women will tell all (thank God; I miss Alexis and Josephine SO MUCH). \nP.S. thank you Anna Moeslein for your reporting help when my Amazon Fire TV decided to go on the fritz mid-episode.
