Headlines Sign Up Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nLarry North is back in the Park Cities where he started. \nLast week, when Dallas' best-known fitness celebrity moved his Larry North Fitness-Preston Royal a couple of miles south to Preston Center, he made good on a vow he'd made to himself nearly a decade ago. \nIn 2009, Ray Washburne bought Highland Park Village from the Henry S. Miller Jr. family. The new landlord had plans for the space that had been North's flagship gym for nearly 20 years. So North got the boot. \nNorth sued and settled. But he had to move out. \nBut it was more than a lease that he lost. North also left his heart behind. \nHis original gym, opened when North was just 28, created his fitness persona. It spawned fitness clubs, best-selling books, speaking gigs, TV appearances, licenses, sponsorships and the Great North American Slimdown , a 1990s infomercial phenomenon that brought in $150 million in revenue during the eight years it aired around the world. \n\"I was deeply, emotionally attached to that club,\" says North, who turns 56 on Thursday. \"When I had to take the last piece of equipment out of it, I was the only one in there, I bawled like a baby. I remember walking down those steps for the last time, and my self-talk is: 'I'll be back. And I'll come back better and stronger.' \n\"It took eight years, but I am back in the 'hood.\" Brandi Farris group fitness director leads a Zumba class. (Nathan Hunsinger/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nAnd he's returned in millennial style, hoping to attract a younger clientele with his not-your-mother's gym. \n\"We're making this into a hip, sexy, eclectic club,\" says North, surveying the work that's not quite finished yet. \"My Highland Park club meets the 21st century.\" \nHis 15,000-square-foot gym is just down from the popular Hopdoddy's on Luther Lane. Moody Family YMCA had been using it while its new facility was being built. \nPerfunctory was transformed into edgy by Dallas architect Tyler Duncan, known for his work at restaurants such as The Porch, Avenu Lounge, Bombshell's Restaurant and Bar, and Mi Cocina. \n\"Most gyms have no character,\" Duncan says. \"They're a sea of equipment, and they're very vanilla -- nothing that creates conversation.\" \nDuncan's favorite element is a large metal-and-glass garage door that serves as a noise barrier when Zumba and other classes are in session but opens for extra training room when they're not. \nThen there's the mood lighting. \n\"Most gyms are flooded with harsh light, which makes your skin color look horrible,\" Duncan says. \"Warm lighting warms up skin tones so that when people look at themselves in the mirror, they feel good about themselves.\" Tyler Duncan designed Larry North's new gym with millennials in mind. (Nathan Hunsinger/The Dallas Morning News) \nAnd it makes for better selfies -- also a design desire. \nSo does a massive graffiti wall that creates an identifiable backdrop for social media posts. \n\"That is a great way to capture free advertising,\" Duncan says. \"People who've been here will say, 'Oh, I know where that is. They're at Larry North because they have that sick graffiti wall.' It'll spark some interest.\" 'Hustle wall' \nNorth loves the \"hustle wall\" of motivational sayings that honors Dallas billionaire Darwin Deason, North's mentor, buddy, trainee and financial backer for decades. It features the motto of the founder of Affiliated Computer Services: \"Good things come to those who are patient -- normally the leftovers from those who hustle.\" \nDeason is thrilled with the tribute. \"Larry's a lovable prince of a guy,\" he says. \"Any help I can give Larry, I will. Larry's become like my third son.\" \nAnd North considers Deason the father he wished he'd had. \n\"My dad was a degenerate and compulsive gambler, Brooklyn mobster type in New York,\" North says. \"He was into bookies, shylocks, loan sharks, family, friends, whoever he could get money from. So we moved around because he was constantly on the lam. He blew every dime we ever had.\" \nBy the time Larry turned 15, he, his mom and his decade-younger twin brothers had been uprooted more than a dozen times in New York, Las Vegas and Los Angeles neighborhoods. \nIn 1978, Larry and his mother decided to pack up the family and flee to Houston. Since Texas didn't have legal gambling, they figured that even if even Larry's father found them, he wouldn't stick around. \nBut they never made it -- their car's engine blew up at Spring Valley Road and North Central Expressway. \nThe family moved into the nearby Continental Inn, an $18-a-night motel. \n\"There was a Pancho's [all-you-could-eat Mexican restaurant] next door, so my mom could feed the family for about five bucks since kids ate free,\" he says. \"We also went to NorthPark, which had 10-cent hot dog specials as part of its opening. \n\"That's how she fed us until she was able to get a job and we got a small apartment in Richardson. She still lives in Richardson today.\" Bus to Doug's \nLarry helped his mom while going to J.J. Pearce High School. \nAt 16, he got a janitorial job and a free membership at Doug's Gym, riding the bus to and from Richardson to downtown. \nHe became one of Dallas' first personal trainers in 1981. \n\"I'm bouncing [at a nightclub] on weekends. I'm selling shoes at Neiman Marcus. I'm training people at 6 in the morning, and going to school at Richland [College],\" he says. \"An 80-hour workweek would have been part-time employment for me. But I liked it because I was generating revenue and I liked people.\" A photograph of Larry North is used to paint his likeness on a mural. (Nathan Hunsinger/The Dallas Morning News) \nA pumped-up bodybuilder selling ladies' shoes at Neiman's? \n\"I read every single Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Bazaar magazine cover to cover,\" he says. \"I knew what colors were in style, what purses were in style. I've always been a student of whatever I did.\" \nIn 1985, the exclusive San Simeon nightclub lured him back into the bouncing business. He made $200 a night in cash, with hundreds more in tips. \"It was best decision I ever made, not because of the money but because all the people in Highland Park went to that club.\" \nThat same year, North waltzed into the office of the program director at KLIF-AM (570) and said he wanted to do a fitness radio show. \nTwo weeks later, he had one. \nThirty years later, North is still on air at KRLD-AM (1080) with lucrative sponsorships from BioTE Medical hormone pellets and ViaScan, which provides body scans. Northwest Highway barrier \nEverywhere he worked, North told people he was going to own his own gym someday. \nNow he has four -- in Dallas at Preston Center and Cityplace, in Fort Worth and in Westlake. North says they're profitable and will bring in about $4.5 million this year. \nNorth is the majority owner but has major investment backing from Deason and Brint Ryan, CEO of Ryan LLC. Chris Gallagher, the company's president, and vice president Jimmy Makofske hold smaller stakes. \n\"Larry is alway in motion, high-energy, very enthusiastic and always looking to improve the business,\" says Gallagher, who started working for North nearly 24 years ago. \"The worst thing is you gotta keep up with him. But that's good because in our business, you've got to move fast.\" \nNorth needs 1,000 members to turn a profit at Preston Center. That won't be a stretch, he says, if he can keep the 600-member base from the old location and re-engage the Park Cities set. \nWhen he lost his lease at Highland Park Village, he unsuccessfully tried to get its members to drive a few minutes north. \n\"I believe that if you live in the Park Cities, your car has a governor on it that stalls it if you go past Northwest Highway,\" North says. \nStacey Fikes has just finished a weight workout. The 29-year-old thinks Preston Center will be more attractive to her fellow millennials than Preston Hollow was. \n\"There are a lot of apartment buildings going up,\" she says. \"My friends and I go to a lot of places around here to grab something to eat and drink.\" \nShe even moved to a new apartment to be closer to the gym. \"I'm pretty attached to my trainer,\" she says. \"Where he goes, I go.\" \nNorth, who still works out diligently, says his sense of purpose has changed now that he's in his 50s. \n\"As younger person, I was in this business to help people look good in a bikini or have a harder body or build up self-esteem,\" he says. \"Now I have a stronger mission for healthy living, not just living for the sake of a slimmer waistline. \n\"I enjoy it more. It's a more fun message. And millennials, surprisingly, resonate with it.\" \nAnd while North still smarts from what happened to him at Highland Park Village, he says it made him smarter. \n\"It forced to me to pivot and make adjustments,\" he says. \"If it hadn't happened, I would have been swallowed up by these bigger clubs and these boutique clubs coming into and flooding the market. \n\"The one thing my competition can't be is me.\" \n#### Larry North Fitness \nFounded: April 1, 1989 \nOwnership: Larry North holds the majority stake.
