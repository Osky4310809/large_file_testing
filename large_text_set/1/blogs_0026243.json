Phone Scam Hang Up on 'Can You Hear Me?' Phone Scam 10 Comments Folks are advised to hang up if an unknown caller asks \"Can you hear me?\" or a similar yes/no question. \nOnce a simple noughties mobile carrier catchphrase, \"Can you hear me?\" has been resurrected as a phone scam. \nPolice in several states are warning folks to simply hang up if an unknown caller asks \"Can you hear me?\" \nThe scam, which began late last year, tricks victims into saying \"yes\"—an affirmative command swindlers can record and use to authorize unwanted charges on a phone or utility bill or credit card, according to CBS News . \nHistorically directed toward businesses, the Pittsburgh Better Business Bureau (BBB) in October reported consumer complaints, citing unsolicited robocalls from \"an employee\" of a home security agency, cruise line, or social security firm. \nCriminals may also use phrases like, \"Are you the lady of the house?\"; \"Do you pay the household telephone bills?\"; or \"Are you the homeowner?\" \n\"You say 'yes,' it gets recorded and they say that you have agreed to something,\" Susan Grant, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), told CBS. \"I know that people think it's impolite to hang up, but it's a good strategy.\" \nThe BBB last fall provided the same advice: \"Just hang up.\" Related Don't Fall for This Sophisticated Gmail Phishing Scam \nAs CBS News pointed out, if a criminal already has your phone number, it's safe to assume they may have also collected personal details—credit card number, cable bill—via a data breach. \nThink you've been hoodwinked? Check your account statements for unfamiliar charges, and call the billing company to dispute any payments you didn't authorize. For additional help, contact the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe CFA did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T16:16:39.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
