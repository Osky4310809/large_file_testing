DENMARK's decision to revamp their league system was given little-to-zero notice across Europe when the Dansk Boldspil-Union announced the changes last year. PUBLISHED: 14:01, Thu, Mar 23, 2017 | UPDATED: 14:11, Thu, Mar 23, 2017 GETTY Premier League boss Richard Scudamore (left) should keep an eye on how the Danish league develops \nThis season, for the first time, the Danish Superliga’s top six clubs have broken away into a new league for the final third of the campaign. \nIt is a move the DBU hopes will inspire competition at the top of the table, while also offering a Europa League spot to the ‘best of the rest’ league below, which also splits into further complicated factions. \nThis week the fixtures for the Championship Round — as the DBU is calling it — were announced. And it is clear from the offset why the big clubs in Denmark wanted this change. \nNot only do they avoid playing near dead rubber matches against the lesser teams — the gap between top and bottom in Denmark is between Championship and League 1 level — but they also get to play their rivals each week — a far more exciting prospect. GETTY FC Copenhagen v Brondby is the biggest game in Danish football - a huge draw for TV audiences GETTY FC Nordsjaelland and FC Midtjylland will also play in the Superliga playoffs \nThe Superliga hopes it will boost revenues from TV and gate receipts, with FC Copenhagen v Brondby and Nordsjælland v Midtjylland proving far more enticing fixtures. \nAnd it is hoped that the more the top teams play each other, the better they will get. Therefore Danish teams may progress further into Europe, having been challenged to do so by their domestic opponents. Competition drives success. \nBut in order to do this the Superliga is, in effect, consigning the lower teams to their place. If you’re not good enough, you will stay not good enough. And this is where the Premier League should take note. Inside the hotel where top Premier League clubs held secret talks Wed, March 2, 2016 Express Sport takes a look inside the luxurious Dorchester Hotel where Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool chiefs have reportedly held secret talks over creating their own 'Super League'... Getty Images 1 of 14 Club bosses from Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City have held talks at The Dorchester hotel, reportedly about the possibility breaking away from the Champions League Playoff may be best option to prevent complete breakaway \nFor there is a drive in England, as well as Spain, Italy, France and Germany, to create a new European super league that would detach the world’s biggest clubs from their domestic competitions for ever. \nThe demand is supposedly there, as is the money. Merely the talk of a 39th game — proposed by the Premier League a few years back — shows football’s decision makers are working on ways to secure their status at the top. \nLast summer the bosses of five Premier League clubs were spotted in a London hotel — the Dorchester (if you’re in the area and fancy a popping in) - talking to an American billionaire on proposed future tournaments. \nBayern Munich’s CEO Karl Heinz-Rummenigge, who also happens to be chairman of the European Club Association that looks after the interests of the big guys, wants a breakaway European league. GETTY The Premier League is the most-watched league in the world but the top clubs want more of the pie GETTY Imagine La Liga without Real Madrid and Barcelona \nAnd all the while clubs from Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Scotland have proposed a secondary European league, jumping ship before they are pushed by the Big Five. \nBut what if there were to be an actual breakaway league - a jump further than what the Danes have done? What would happen if Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham said goodbye to the Premier League? It should be a genuine concern not only for the league but also the FA and the remaining clubs in England. For without these big six teams England's money pool would dry up dramatically. \nThe international recognition of the Premier League, which earns every club over £100million in TV revenues alone and more in sponsorship deals and merchandise sales, would almost certainly dry up if the 'Big Six' weren’t there. \nEven if you collected the remaining clubs with large fan bases — Newcastle, Everton, Aston Villa, Leeds United — they couldn’t carry English football without the others. The narrative would also change. No longer would you be English champions in the true eyes of sport.
