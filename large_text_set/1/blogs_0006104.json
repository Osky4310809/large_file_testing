An Easy Explanation of Biblical Salvation \nBiblical salvation is God's way of providing his people deliverance from sin and spiritual death through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. In the Old Testament , the concept of salvation is rooted in Israel's deliverance from Egypt in the Book of Exodus . The New Testament reveals the source of salvation in Jesus Christ . By faith in Jesus Christ , believers are saved from God's judgment of sin and its consequenceâ€”eternal death. Why Salvation? \nWhen Adam and Eve rebelled, man was separated from God through sin. God's holiness required punishment and payment ( atonement ) for sin, which was (and still is) eternal death. Our death is not sufficient to cover the payment for sin. Only a perfect, spotless sacrifice , offered in just the right way, can pay for our sin. Jesus, the perfect God-man, came to offer the pure, complete and everlasting sacrifice to remove, atone, and make eternal payment for sin. Why? Because God loves us and desires an intimate relationship with us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:15:46.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
