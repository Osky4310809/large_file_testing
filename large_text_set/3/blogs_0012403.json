By: FE Online | Published: March 17, 2017 5:06 PM “The government is planning to increase the number of seats but is not at all concerned about providing proper hostel facility,” some students of the college told ANI news agency. \nOne of the key claims of the Delhi government was revolutionising education. But Arvind Kejriwal seems to have forgotten that. While the CM is busy with the political battles, the students of GB Pant Government Engineering College have been sleeping inside the college campus from the past 11 days, demanding better facilities. “The government is planning to increase the number of seats but is not at all concerned about providing proper hostel facility,” some students of the college told ANI news agency. \n“We have a basic demand which is the right of every student in India. The protest was started a few months back but from the past eleven days, we are staying in the college at night demanding better facilities in the college campus. Due to lack of basic amenities, we don’t get good placement offers as no company wants to come here,” said one of the protesting students. As per the students, they don’t even have enough classrooms and lab facility due to which they have to compromise with their studies. \n“Few students live far away from this place. We don’t even get time to study and cover up our course. We are just demanding proper hostel facility so that we don’t have to travel this much,” added another student. The students further said that they would continue their protest till all demands are met. \nTwo weeks of student protest in Delhi’s GB Pant College; all they want is a campus. #AAPkaSach pic.twitter.com/vVH8Qntf7c \n— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) March 17, 2017 \nFormer AAP leader Yogendra Yadav spoke to Times Now on this issue. “There was a news the other day of blind students, whose school is about to be closed. We get all this publicity about the loan-waiver scheme and then we realise that less amount of loans have been sanctioned than the amount spent on advertisements for that scheme. And now the news about the GB Pant college. I really think if the Delhi government did less of publicity and spent that much money in actual education work then that would be much better for the credibility of the government and the students of Delhi,” he said Please Wait while comments are loading...
