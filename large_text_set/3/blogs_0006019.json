PUBLISHED: 11:15, Thu, Mar 9, 2017 | UPDATED: 11:18, Thu, Mar 9, 2017 \nKylian Mbappe is one of the hottest young attacking prospects in Europe and has been on fire for Monaco this season. \nThe 18-year-old has scored 15 goals in all competitions for the French side and is said to have caught the eye of Manchester United and Real Madrid. \nHowever, Arsene Wenger has claimed it was Arsenal who spotted him first, making a bid for the striker last summer which was rejected. \n\"Well, I approached him last year because I really believe that he has an exceptional future ahead of him, that he has all the qualities,\" Wenger said. \n\"He reminds me of a young Thierry Henry with the same clever look about him, the same qualities of intelligence in his movements and cat-like finishing. So that’s why. \n\"I think he’s an exceptional talent who promises to have a great future. \n\"Unfortunately today, all these young players are in full view from very, very early on and all the big clubs want them. \n\"I hope the fact that everybody is already talking about him isn’t going to have a negative impact on his future.” \nMbappe is under contract with Monaco until June 2019.
