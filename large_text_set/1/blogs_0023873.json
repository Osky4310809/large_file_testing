It is projected to sell 70-80K copies, including 28-33K in pure sales. HDD also projects country singer Brantley Gilbert's new album The Devil Donâ€™t Sleep to sell 70-80K copies, with 60-70K coming from pure sales. This one is going to be a nail-biter. \nMigos' 2015 debut album Yung Rich Nation sold 14 thousand copies its first week and debuted at #17 on the charts. The Atlanta trio has leveled up... stay tuned for final first-week sales results.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T17:08:22.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
