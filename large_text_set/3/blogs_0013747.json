The group was photographed hitting a ton of rides, like Splash Mountain, and snacking on some of the park's finest, including ice cream, of course. \nThe television president was a big supporter of Clinton during the campaign, speaking at the DNC conference and joining the former candidate on the set of Scandal alongside Abedin. They even teamed up for an interview with Ellen DeGeneres last year, too. \nMeanwhile, Goldwyn and Musky have been married for 30 years. They have two daughters together, Anna and Tess .
