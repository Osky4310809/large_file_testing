Kangana is ruthless as she tells KJo if there ever was a biopic made on her life, Karan would play the snooty insider who is relentlessly unwelcoming to the outsider. Ouch! Watch the promo here: Up next, the Nawab & the Queen are coming to rule on the Koffee couch like never before! #KoffeeWithKaran pic.twitter.com/eB43uXLz4w \n— Star World (@StarWorldIndia) February 12, 2017 \nCan’t wait for Sunday! 71", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:01:05.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
