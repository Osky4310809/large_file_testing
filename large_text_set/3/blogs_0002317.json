And on National Pig Day , of all days.\nSEE ALSO: Why has this country become Tinder's favourite testing ground?\nRewind a day: A San Francisco guy shared his friend's screenshots from Tinder, in which a guy named Nick hurled racist, sexist abuse at her after she ignored him. It was all pretty awful.\nNot only were people outraged by the abuse, but others came forward with their own allegations of abusive behavior by the same guy.\nNaturally, Tinder didn't want to be associated with such high levels of douchery. Rosette Pambakian, the vice president of communications and branding, penned the open letter to \"Nick (and anyone who behaves like you)\" and had it posted on the company's blog.\n\"Tinder has a zero-tolerance policy on disrespect. No racist rants. No sexist pigs. No trolling. No jerks who can't get over their own inadequacies long enough to have a decent conversation with another person on Tinder,\" she wrote. \"I was personally offended by what you said. Your words to that woman were an assault, not only on her, but on all of us.\"\nThe real doozy though, has to be this line: \"You have a lot to learn, Nick. I see that you studied global business, and that you joined your school's programs for young entrepreneurs and technology management. Great choices. Because you'll need to search far and wide to find an organization that will employ you now.\"\nTruer words were never spoken. Happy National Pig Day, everyone but this sh*tty person.\nBONUS: Our picks for the top 10 best film performances in cinema history", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/FBsQLuxe.m3u8", "http://blog.gotinder.com/in-commemoration-of-national-pig-day/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/FBsQLuxe.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Pig_Day", "https://www.facebook.com/trank.kevin/posts/10154635723567946", "http://giphy.com/embed/g5yI1nXOJB4SQ?html5=true", "http://giphy.com/embed/hKrpeqRJowwi4?html5=true"], "published": "2017-03-03T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:19:09.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
