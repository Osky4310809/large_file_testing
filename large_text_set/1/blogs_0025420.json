I had no idea that dresses like this still existed until I found House of Landor . \nHouse of Landor is located inside the vintage furniture and décor shop Finds . The shop sells vintage clothing from the 50’s, 60’s and 70’s -- mainly cocktail dresses and evening gowns. Outfits are priced between $100 and $400. \nThey are all glamorous, and most of them literally sparkle. \nHouse of Landor owner Mary Beth Paulson has always admired vintage clothing. After her kids moved out, she transformed her love of vintage clothing into a woman’s dream job! She travels across the country in search of unique vintage outfits for her clients and friends. \nBetween 150 and 200 pieces are kept in stock at House of Landor at a time, but Paulson holds certain “never before seen” pieces back for trunk shows. \nPaulson is at Finds a few days a week to help vintage fashion seekers find the perfect piece for their occasion. Her knowledge of vintage designers, styles and fabrics paired with her ability to mix and match the pieces to create the perfect look make her an expert stylist. \nPaulson puts a lot of thought and care into each piece. While most of the dresses at House of Landor are in their original state, Paulson will sometimes make alterations to modernize pieces, like she did with this sassy cocktail dress which was once a floor-length gown. \nThese vintage ensembles are well made, affordable and recycled! \nThe outfits found at House of Landor are not your weekend brunch dresses -- unless your squad goes total glam for brunch. Instead, I would describe these as occasion pieces. If I’m looking for a NYE dress that sparkles, celebrating a work promotion or searching for that perfect dress for my wedding rehearsal dinner, I’m buying from House of Landor. \nHouse of Landor’s Instagram has post after post of gorgeous available pieces, which is the perfect way to keep an eye out for your next vintage outfit. If you’re looking for something glamorous and unique that no one else has, look no further than House of Landor! \nIf you want to see more House of Landor and hear Mary Beth Paulson’s full story, tune into WRAL Out & About TV on Wednesday, Feb. 1 at 7:30 p.m. on WRAL! \nCopyright 2017 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.
