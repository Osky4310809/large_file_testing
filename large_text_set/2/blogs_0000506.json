The update, which is still in beta, is said to be relatively lightweight, with general optimizations like improved stability and security patches. However, the inclusion of a fingerprint gesture on the Nexus 5X might have some fans excited about it.\nOn the Google Pixel and Pixel XL released last year, you can swipe downward on the fingerprint sensor to reveal the notification shade. It’s a gesture that’s particularly useful for bigger devices (or people with small hands) where it’s hard to reach the top of the display when operating the device one-handed.\nSee also: Nexus 6 and 9 won’t be updated to Android 7.1.2 Nougat 2 days ago Despite availability on the Pixels, the functionality didn’t appear on the Nexus 5X and 6P when they were first upgraded to Android Nougat. With Android 7.1.2, you can now find the feature on the Nexus 5X in Settings > Moves , and it’s likely to appear on the Nexus 6P too when that starts to receive the Android 7.1.2 Developer Preview.\nWhile it’s nice to see Google add this Pixel feature to the Nexus phones, we wish it was Google Assistant instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T10:47:24.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
