Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017 \n\nPelosi, who has called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions ' resignation after it was made clear he lied under oath, quickly responded:\n. @realDonaldTrump doesn't know difference between official mtg photographed by press & closed secret mtg his AG lied about under oath. https://t.co/YRFCuJkjLA \n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) March 3, 2017 \n\nYeah, not sure where Trump is getting the idea that Pelosi lied about whether she had a meeting in which a member of the Russian government was in attendance.\nRelated: Trump Drops That Whole 'Sounding Presidential' Thing To Defend Jeff Sessions \nIs POTUS really that clueless?\nOr does he know this will be enough misdirection for the people he was able to fool into voting for him?\nObviously he's got good brain. Why, it only took him THREE attempts to correctly spell the word \"hereby\" — take a look:\nWhen Betsey Devos is Secretary Of Education. pic.twitter.com/1ZoZufB3Qw \n— Matthew A.
