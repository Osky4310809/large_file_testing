However, these days, lager is the predominant type of beer available in India. It comes in two strengths -- mild (around 5% alcohol) and a generous strong (6-8% alcohol). Depending on the place, a large 650 ml bottle of beer will cost you about 100 rupees at a liquor store, and double or triple that at a bar in India. \nWhile international beer brands such as Fosters, Tuborg, Carlsberg, Heineken and Budweiser are available and very popular in India, this article focuses only on Indian beer brands. \nThe largest producer of beer in India is Bangalore-based United Breweries , which makes Kingfisher and Kalyani Black Label. The company dominates more than half the market. Global brewing giant SABMiller entered the Indian market in 2000. In 2001, it acquired Mysore Breweries (which makes Knock Out beer), followed by Shaw Wallace’s beer brands Royal Challenge and Haywards 5000 in 2003. It's the second largest beer producer in India, with a market share of around 25%. Tor Lillqvist/Flickr/CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 1. Kingfisher \nKingfisher, \"The King of Good Times\", is India's most recognized and widely available beer. Its name has been associated with sports, fashion, and even an airline. The brand was launched in India in 1978 and has a huge market share of about 40%. The beer itself is a light tasting, easy drinking beer with plenty of malt. It goes down really well -- if not a little too well at times! The very popular Kingfisher Strong, containing around 8% alcohol, leads the Indian beer market. It has more flavor than the regular Kingfisher Premium, which has 4.8% alcohol. Another variation is Kingfisher Blue, marketed at the young and trendy. This is also a strong beer with around 8% alcohol but it has a very light watery taste. Distinctive and full-bodied Kingfisher Ultra, made from imported ingredients, is the newest label to hit the market.

Haywards \nThe Haywards beer brand is most well known for its iconic Haywards 5000 strong lager, which contains 7% alcohol. The brand was launched in 1974, with the Haywards 2000 mild beer, as an extension of the renowned Haywards liquor brand (which was founded in the early 1900s). Haywards 5000 subsequently hit the market in 1978. Recently, in 2015, SABMiller launched a Haywards 5000 BOLD beer that's brewed for 48 hours longer and has a full-bodied taste. Haywards also produces a rarer super strong Haywards 10000. Haywards has a market share of 12%, and is consumed the most in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and Chattisgarh. \nThe Haywards brand of liquor was founded by Britisher Sir Anthony Hayward, and two of his grandchildren run a fantastic heritage bed and breakfast in south Goa. The bar serves Haywards 5000, of course. And there's free beer for anyone who can beat the drinking record. Knock Out beer. SABMiller. 3. Knock Out \nLaunched in 1984, Knock Out beer is particularly popular in the states of Karnataka, Telangana and Maharashtra. According to SABMiller, the company the brews the beer, the brand's purpose is to \"celebrate strong men who display a strong character\". It's a sweet tasting strong malt beer with an alcohol content of 8%, made with good carbonation. The brand has about a 9% market share and many loyal drinkers. anaxolotl/Flickr/CC BY NC 2.0 4. Kalyani Black Label \nKalyani Black Label is one of India's oldest lagers. It has iconic status in West Bengal, where it was launched in 1969. The beer is named after one of United Breweries' first breweries, in the West Bengal town of Kalyani near Kolkata . It's popular across eastern India as well as Delhi , and comes in both premium (mild) and strong varieties. The strong beer is described as \"a smooth, mellowed brew with an extra bite\". Its alcohol content, at 7.8%, packs quite a punch, along with its sweet aftertaste. If you like a beer with plenty of flavor, go for Kalyani. SABMiller. 5. Royal Challenge \nRoyal Challenge Premium Lager was launched in 1993 and has an alcohol content of about 5%. The beer's long brewing cycle makes it smooth with a rich taste. Advertising focuses on the brand's smoothness with the line, \"Wish your life was as smooth as Royal Challenge\". It's not as flavorsome as Kalyani Black Label, but is still distinctive. SABMiller launched a strong version of the beer in south India in 2011. Mikhail Esteves/Flickr/CC BY NC SA 2.0 6. Kings \nThe beautiful beaches of Goa and Kings beer go hand in hand. This beer, which unfortunately is only brewed and sold in the state of Goa, is a highlight of any trip there. The Kings Black Label premium pilsner is a very light tasting, pale colored, beer that's known for its smoky malt aroma. Its got an alcohol content of 4.85%, and is priced very attractively. A small 375 ml bottle will only set you back around 40 rupees at most beach shacks, and half that at a liquor store. No wonder Kings remains a fond memory for many people long after the vacation is over!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:16.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
