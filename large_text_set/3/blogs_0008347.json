However, it's been heating up over the last few months. The latest move seems an unlikely shot to fire, seeing as how secondhand bookstores aren't your typical gender battlegrounds.\nHowever, Loganberry Books in Shaker Heights, Ohio, seems to want to be just that with its latest move.\nIn case you can't tell, the store has reversed the spines on the books by male authors on their shelves, making it difficult to find anything written by anyone without a Y chromosome.\nThe store, which is owned by a woman and has no men on staff, made the move in honor of National Women's Month. They decided to spend two hours making it more difficult for customers to browse their inventory.\n\"I was looking for an event and activity to commemorate Women's History Month, but I grow weary of doing the same thing over and over again,\" says [Harriet] Logan, who's owned the bookstore for more than 20 years. \"Just reading from great pieces of literature didn't seem participatory enough, and this activity doesn't require anything.\"\nLogan says that the spines to the wall method isn't her invention, but she's never heard of anyone putting this sort of feminist/political awareness spin on it.\n\"My staff is entirely female here, but we have a lot of books written by women and about women, and we go out of our way to get them,\" Logan says.\nAlready she says that customers have been confused by the new sorting system.\n\"Truly, this is a metaphor of silencing the male voice,\" Logan says. \"At least for this month.\"\nMeanwhile, on Facebook, Logan claims to be highlighting the discrepancy between the number of male versus female authors. Of course, as a secondhand bookstore, their inventory isn't necessarily indicative of what is being published from year to year, only what people are looking to sell for extra cash.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/03/09/female-owned-bookstore-turns-books-by-male-authors-backward-for-womens-month/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Floganberrybooks%2Fposts%2F10154167305336010&width=500", "http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2017/03/03/loganberry-books-shelves-mens-books-backwards-as-a-metaphor-of-silencing-the-male-voice"], "published": "2017-03-09T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:32:48.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
