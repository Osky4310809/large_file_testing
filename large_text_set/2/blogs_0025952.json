And now he’s about to get paid like not just a starter, but one of the best in the league. \nDuvernay-Tardif and the Chiefs are finalizing a five-year contract, Ian Rapoport of NFL Media reports. The value of the extension is reportedly $41.25 million, but there’s no word on the structure of the contract or how much of that is guaranteed. \nThe 26-year-old Duvernay-Tardif is currently slated to make a $690,000 base salary in 2017. \nDuvernay-Tardif studies medicine in the offseasons and plans to become a doctor when he retires. This deal should ensure that he won’t be hurting for money when it’s time for him to go into medicine.
