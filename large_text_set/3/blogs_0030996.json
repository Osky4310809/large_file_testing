What about Lukaku? \nSAV SAYS: “I think you mean no Arsenal or Manchester City players, right? Antonio Valencia and Zlatan Ibrahimovic both made my team, and they play for United. If you were referring to the lack of City representation, I must admit there was one dilemma – David Silva or Adam Lallana. Look, it's only my personal opinion, and I love watching Silva play, but this season I don't feel he has been quite as influential as previous years at the Etihad, while Lallana has had an excellent season for club and country. If you asked 100 neutrals to choose between them, 50 would probably have gone for Silva and 50 for Lallana. As for Romelu Lukaku... yes, he's had a fantastic season for Everton, but I went for Zlatan simply because he's scored 26 goals – including two in a cup final – and in my 4-3-3 formation, there is not enough room for more than one No.9 centre forward.” Lukaku did not make the cut despite his impressive season (Photo: Getty) \nStJohn @stjohn121: Don't worry Robbie, if it were a top 11 pundits of the year you can feel confident you wouldn't be included \nSAV SAYS: “Haha, I'm quite tickled by your chirp. No problem – just as picking a team of footballers is a matter of conjecture and opinion, the same rule applies to picking a Pundits XI. Evidently the radio academy doesn't agree with you, or they would not have voted Six-0-Six the best sports show on the radio, and in the podcast charts Flintoff, Savage and the Ping Pong Guy is No.1 – but I'm just grateful to have a job I really enjoy. How about you, mate?” \nLuke @LKenz: What are you on about here then? Milner has been awful this season \nSAV SAYS: “James Milner, awful this season? I think you have been watching games upside down, Luke, because he has been a revelation at left-back for Liverpool. I could not put him in my Premier League team of the season ahead of Marcos Alonso, but to say Milner has been 'awful' is a ridiculous statement.” James Milner has had an impressive season for Liverpool in a make-shift position (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) \nJD85 @The_JoboCop: Zlatan only started performing in October – before that he was one of the donkeys of the season. Costa is POTS \nSAV SAYS: “I've never heard such claptrap. Donkeys are on the beach at Blackpool, mate, not scoring 26 goals for Manchester United. If Ibrahimovic made such a lousy start, how come he scored five goals in his first five games for the club? What kind of start is that? Yes, United struggled to hit their stride until the autumn, which is why they find themselves so far off the pace in the title race, but how many goals do you think 35-year-old should score in the Premier League before you spare him the 'donkey' tag? If you believe Diego Costa is player of the season, that's OK – you are entitled to your opinion. But don't call Zlatan a donkey when his value to United speaks for itself.” Ibrahimovic celebrates his first Manchester United goal... which came in August (Photo: Matthew Peters) \nfintan mc hale @HaleforceMc: No Costa. You will need a bodyguard with him and Keane out to get you \nSAV SAYS: “Don't get me wrong, I love watching Costa play. This season he has just about struck the right balance between scoring goals and getting under defenders' skin without crossing the line between aggression and dark arts. I think he's been a brilliant player for Chelsea. But if I was still playing in the top flight now, and the PFA voting forms came round for my team of the season, I would put Zlatan in my team ahead of Costa. I shouldn't need a bodyguard for expressing my opinion.” \nCFCJMM @CFCJMM: Not having Azpilicueta is ridiculous \nSAV SAYS: “Of course it's not ridiculous. In a 4-3-3, I didn't feel I could justify picking him as one of the the two centre-backs ahead of Michael Keane, David Luiz or Toby Alderweireld, and I could not pick him as left-back ahead of Alonso, Danny Rose or James Milner. That's the beauty of picking these 'dream' teams – it's not a perfect science. But make no mistake, I think Azpilicueta has had a terrific season and he's been worth his weight in gold to Chelsea as a full-back on either flank or as one of three centre-backs.
