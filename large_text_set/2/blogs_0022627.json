Raven \nI am not really interested in any of the mods other than battery packs. They just need to release some decent battery mods at a decent price. Let’s have a 3000mah pack for $20 and a 5000mah pack for $30 and I will be sold. The $80 regular price (got half off for buying with phone) of the 3000mah pack that my wife bought to go with her Moto Z Play was ridiculous. But, she does love being able to hot swap that battery pack. Matt Lang \nLenovo was also not going to kill off the Moto X line, but I think we all see how that played out Adrian Fishler \nWooot. Much excite. I love my Z, and I’ve already backed a couple of the upcoming mods on Indiegogo. Interested to see what else they can come up with. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \n3 years of the same very wide design? That’s definitely commitment Tony Gultice \nThe only thing that needs to stay the same is the back of the phone. the front can go bezel-less, or the chin can be shrunk, hell even the fingerprint sensor could be integrated into the display. The actual width of the phone feels good. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nMy only issue with the Z Play was that it was too wide The Doctor \nThe phone has been out for seven months already and there has yet to be a new Moto Mod on the market. \nI’ll take this with a grain of salt.
