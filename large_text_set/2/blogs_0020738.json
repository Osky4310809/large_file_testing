LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ \nLabour leader Andrew Little said the win proved that his party was ready for this year's general election. \nSpeaking to party faithful and her friends, family and Labour Party colleagues, Ardern said the win was \"overwhelming\" and gave thanks to her supporters, her campaign team and friends and family. \nTalking to media afterwards, she touched on the nature of the campaign which was cleanly fought without the presence of a centre-right candidate. LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ \nArdern celebrates with her partner Clarke Gayford. \n\"Regardless of whether or not National wanted to run or not, we would have always wanted to run a contest that was a contest of ideas. \n\"That was something we asked the Government to do - to put themselves forward, to show some leadership and be willing to debate those ideas on a National platform as party of the by-election. \n\"So I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.\" LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ \nArdern will have the seat for seven months before attention shifts to this year's general election. \nBoth Little and Ardern said they did not know what to expect in terms of turnout. \n\"There were so many elements of this election that were totally unpredictable... but the main thing is we got our vote out, and they voted in numbers and we got the result,\" said Little. \nIt proved Labour was ready for the General Election. LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ \nArdern said her landslide victory was \"overwhelming\". \n\"I think if you look at the Mt Roskill by-elections, the local government elections and this election, we got our vote out because of the hard work Jacinda and her team did,\" he said. \n\"But I feel very confident about the quality of our organisation and the issues that we've picked and that we're going to be campaigning on.\" \nHe said some specific campaigning techniques had been tested in the by-election campaign, which he expected to translate to a general election campaign. \nLittle said the party's coffers were not stunted by having to contest an unexpected by-election. \nArdern said Genter had been texting her throughout the night. The pair had illustrated a close bond throughout the campaign trail, often giving each other lifts to events and photobombing each other's selfies. \nA staunch Labour electorate, the seat was Ardern's to lose and National chose not to stand a candidate rather than spend money on an unwinnable seat - just seven months out from the general election. \nIn recent years, Mt Albert has been previously held by David Shearer and Helen Clark - two former Labour leaders, and the latter a former Prime Minister. \nThe by-election was sparked by the departure of Shearer late last year, to take a high-risk and high-profile role as the United Nations' special envoy to the South Sudan. \nAndrew Little would not be drawn on mounting speculation Ardern's win could put deputy leader Annette King in a precarious position. \n\"There is no vacancy in that position,\" he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T11:24:33.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
