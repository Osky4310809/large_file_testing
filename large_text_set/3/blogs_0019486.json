Jones believes United can crack the top four (Photo: Manchester United) \n“When we’ve dropped points so has everyone else and when we’ve won so has everyone else, so that’s why we’ve been in same position for so long. \n“But for us it doesn’t matter. We just concentrate on every game and we are up to fifth now. \n“It shows the fight in the squad - not literally - but it shows we’re prepared to fight for each other. \n“You can’t buy that. It’s in everyone. It rubs off on us from the manager. \n“It’s all about a willingness to win and fight for each other. Whatever formation we play or the tactics we play, ultimately it’s about the fight in every player and we’re showing that at the moment.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:46:21.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
