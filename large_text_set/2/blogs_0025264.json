Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA one-bed house that is just 7ft 11in wide has gone on the market for £595,000 . \nNoel Lodge, a former horse and cart entrance for a neighbouring building in Ealing, West London, costs the same as a five-bed barn conversion in Cheshire. \nThe three-storey property, which is ­sandwiched between two blocks of flats, is 21ft 3in deep and has 560sqft of space. \nThe ground floor has a kitchen and dining room and the other two floors have almost identical layouts, with a room of 12ft 7in by 7ft 10in and a bathroom with a shower. The first-floor room could be used as a second bedroom rather than a living room. (Photo: BNPS) \nAlso, the stairs mean there's restricted head height in part of the kitchen. \nThe building was originally a manor that was turned into a day school for poor children in 1834 and was formed by Lady Byron, widow of the poet Lord Byron. The cost of the house works out at £1,062.50 per square foot (Photo: Savills/BNPS) The small but relaxing lounge (Photo: BNPS) The entrance surrounded by potted plants (Photo: BNPS) \nIt continued as a school under various names, including Byron House School and Ealing Grammar School, until it closed in 1917 and the building later became flats. \nThe ground floor of Noel Lodge is believed to have been the horse and cart entrance and stabling for the buildings in their early years.

The bed, laid sideways, shows how narrow the bedroom is (Photo: Savills/BNPS) \nMatthew Gilbert, from estate agents Savills , said: \"This completely unique and charming property is perfectly formed, with every square foot of space cleverly maximised. \n\"It offers buyers both a blend of original character and modern touches, and the accommodation has been laid out very creatively with a degree of flexibility too. \n\"It is only 8ft wide so there is only so many options you have. The ground floor is the kitchen and dining room, it can't really be anything else. The house has a small patio out the back overlooking a garden (Photo: BNPS) \n\"But what's nice is the other two floors are almost identical in size and layout. So the current owners use the first floor as a sitting room and have a bedroom on the top floor, but you could use it as two bedrooms. \n\"Typically at this price buyers in Ealing are limited to flats, so to find a period two-bedroom house for under £600,000 is enticing.

We've had some quite bohemian people look at it, it would appeal to anyone who wants something a bit funky and different - a couple, someone downsizing, an artist maybe. \n\"There is nothing quite like this, it's a very cute little property. It makes you stop and look but equally you would walk past and not even notice it was there.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:55:54.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
