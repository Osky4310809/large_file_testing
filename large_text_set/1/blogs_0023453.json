Durkin | 7:07   \nAt international airports across the country today, scores of protestors have gathered with signs and chants in direct opposition to the newest executive order on immigration by President Donald Trump . \nThe executive action, signed Friday afternoon , took drastic steps in curbing immigration in Muslim-majority countries; it officially suspended the entry of refugees into   months, and all Syrian refugees are barred indefinitely. The response has been swift, with large crowds beginning to gather at New York City’s JFK Airport before spreading to airports around the country. \nCurrently at JFK, eleven men are being detained despite landing in the United States with travel visas and green cards; the Muslim men are being held in Terminal 4 of the international airport, which is where thousands of people have gathered throughout the day. One detainee from Iraq — Hameed Khalid Darweesh , who helped the U.S.   interpreter — was eventually released. \nTake a look at some of social media’s images and videos at airports around the country. \nJFK – Queens, New York City Oh look, it's the missing crowd from Inauguration Day protesting the #MuslimBan at JFK Airport! @CNNPolitics @MSNBC pic.twitter.com/oHMYIxRLr1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T02:50:48.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
