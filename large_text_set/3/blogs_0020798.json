Currently, these drinks are only available in participating Northern California locations, which have upgraded to the new $12,000 coffee machines . The best news is, between March 20-26, these drinks are only $1 for a small! That's like a sixth of the price of a similar beverage at Starbucks. But if you don't live anywhere near there, we're apt to think you can hack your drink order at any McDonald's location so long as you order what's in each drink. Here are the descriptions: \nCaramel Macchiato: Espresso, caramel-flavored syrup, steamed milk, and caramel drizzle. \nFrench Vanilla Cappuccino: Espresso, vanilla-flavored syrup, steamed milk. \nAmericano: Espresso with hot water \nBelow, find the complete list of participating counties, so you can caffeinate luxuriously with these new drinks: Sacramento", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:09:53.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
