Speaking as someone constantly surrounded by traffic noise, a packed schedule, and a not-for-the-faint-of-heart commute, having a cozy bed to jump into at the end of the day is crucial and much appreciated. But even more important than what you sleep on is the overall environment you've created for yourself. \nLooking to turn your room into a place you'll be really excited to escape to? Start by upgrading your bedroom basics: 1. Cozy Bedding (Image credit: Urban Outfitters ) \nNever underestimate the power of good bedding. Try to find a set made from breathable material like cotton, which will keep you from overheating (or freezing) during the night. And as a bonus with a set like this, light colors help a space feel more open, so no claustrophobia-centric nightmares for you. 2. Some Greenery (Image credit: Apartment Therapy Marketplace ) \nThere's just something instantly calming about plants, and the natural edge of a handmade planter only helps to elevate it. Certain types will work to actively clean your air, meaning you can breathe easier (and therefore hopefully sleep longer) during the night. 3. A Plush Rug (Image credit: Pottery Barn ) \nSince getting out of bed is hard enough on its own, invest in something that you'll really want to jump up and sink your toes into. As someone who lives in an old building with wood floors, I can attest to the motivational powers of a fluffy bedside rug. No more cold feet about getting your day started. 4. Mood Lighting (Image credit: Anthropologie ) \nSkip the harsh fluorescents and create a peaceful mood! Dim candlelight will instantly relax you, and the soft flickering is essentially hypnotic in lulling you to sleep. And although little tea lights are less likely to fall over and catch fire like their pillar counterparts, maybe give yourself the gift of ease of mind and blow them out before bed. 5. A Snuggly Throw (Image credit: Etsy ) \nCan you ever have too many throw blankets? When you're looking to curl up with a good book but not commit to diving completely under the covers, a chunky knit blanket is the perfect accompaniment. 6. Calming Artwork (Image credit: Apartment Therapy Marketplace ) \nArt is personal, but ideally your bedroom isn't the place for busy and jarring pieces. Try to find something that's calming to look at: like with the plants, nature art or anything in blue or green tones should work its magic to create a mental escape. 7. Blackout Curtains (Image credit: West Elm ) \nNo, blackout curtains don't have to be black and yes, you'll totally love them. Bright natural light may be a blessing during the day, but no one likes being woken up on the weekends by sunlight gleaming into their eyes. Blackout curtain panels put you instantly turn your bedroom into a dark and peaceful place to get (and maintain) some serious z's. 8. A Bed Bench (Image credit: Apartment Therapy Marketplace ) \nWhen I get home from work, my first instinct is to toss my bag and jacket directly on the floor. Hello, prime candidate for a bed bench! This underappreciated seating area is great for putting on shoes, setting down accessories, and organizing your things when getting ready. A well-organized room = peace of mind. 9. A Multi-functional Nightstand (Image credit: Apartment Therapy Marketplace ) \nEveryone needs bedside storage within an arm's reach. What I like about nightstands like these is that you have a convenient way to store books or magazines, and a drawer for a sleep mask or calming essential oils. Is the drawer also perfect for hiding a midnight snack or two? Absolutely. 10. Breakfast in Bed (Image credit: Apartment Therapy Marketplace ) \nAnd of course, no sanctuary is complete without an opportunity to treat yourself. The best way to really enjoy your bedroom is to find time to take things slow and relax: a Sunday morning breakfast in bed will get you refreshed and ready for the week ahead...and filled up on tasty treats.
