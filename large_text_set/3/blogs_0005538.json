We want to have products that we can put our stamp of authority so that we can be held responsible.” \nThe governor promised to see to the establishment of an outfit for the production of NYSC kits to train corps members and empower those with good business proposals. \nHe said: “We will do something around helping the Abia people to get this bank guarantee we are talking about. We are working our way around it to favour the voiceless, those people who are actually doing this with their hands, yet they are unable to interpret the language of the bank.” \nResponding, Kazaure told the governor that Abia producers were welcome to NYSC bidding/procurement process to avoid going contrary to legal rules. \nHe maintained that the scheme was widely respected for its law-abiding principle, though it believed the governor and the Abians, procurement rules would be strictly followed. \n“Once Abia people meet our standard, they will have our support. NYSC is not in doubt about what is happening in Abia State.” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T05:44:47.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
