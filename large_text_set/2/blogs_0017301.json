Here's a look at our pick of Walcott's top five goals for the Gunners: \nChelsea 3-5 Arsenal (Premier League -- Oct. 29, 2011) \nWalcott turned a stumble into arguably his best goal in this memorable victory at Stamford Bridge. Driving forward about 40 yards from goal, Walcott initially tripped over his own feet and went flying forward face first. But as four Chelsea defenders stood haplessly around him, raising their arms to show it wasn't a foul, Walcott bounced back up and continued his run. By the time John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic reacted, it was too late. Walcott burst past them and fired a perfect shot past Petr Cech to put the Gunners ahead 3-2, their first lead of the game. \nArsenal 2-1 Manchester City (Premier League -- Dec. 21, 2015) \nWalcott isn't known for scoring from distance, but Manchester City learned you can't give him too much space outside the box. After taking a pass from Mesut Ozil just inside the area, Walcott cut back outside and let rip with a fierce right-footed strike that flew past Joe Hart into the far corner to give the Gunners the lead at the Emirates. It was a beautiful goal and an important one as well as Arsenal vanquished their Premier League title rivals with a statement win. Theo Walcott's eye-catching individual goal at chelsea was one of his most memorable in an Arsenal shirt. \nArsenal 7-3 Newcastle United (Premier League -- Dec. 29, 2012) \nHaving already netted two goals in a wild game, Walcott completed his hat-trick in spectacular fashion in injury time. After playing a short free kick with Jack Wilshere near the corner flag, Walcott went past two Newcastle defenders to break into the area and was quickly surrounded by two more. Losing his footing, Walcott slid along the ground - seemingly his favourite move - before popping back up and calmly lifting the ball over Tim Krul with a delicate chip from a tight angle. \nArsenal 4-1 West Bromwich Albion (Premier League -- May 24, 2015) \nWalcott proved he was back to his best after a lengthy injury layoff by netting a first-half hat trick that started with a thunderous drive into the far top corner that was the highlight of the game. After taking a pass from Santi Cazorla inside the right edge of the area, Walcott controlled the ball with one touch and fired in an unstoppable shot with his second. \nChelsea 2-1 Arsenal (League Cup final -- Feb. 25, 2007) \nPerhaps not technically one his best five, but this was Walcott's first goal in an Arsenal shirt and noticeable because of cool finish he produced on such a big occasion. Abou Diaby fed Walcott the ball on the edge of the area and he glided past Ricardo Carvalho before lifting the ball calmly over Petr Cech to make it 1-0. Arsenal went on to lose, but Walcott had announced himself on the big stage. \nMattias is ESPN FC's Arsenal correspondent.
