Elizabeth Gomez, are deployed in Iraq and Kuwait, respectively. \nThe children and their parents have been apart for nine months. \nSo, while the children expected to throw out a first pitch, a pair of “players” in catcher’s equipment hustled onto the field. \nPer TBO.com \nDaniel and Isabella Gomez were told they were chosen to represent all the kids with parents serving the U.S. military overseas by throwing out ceremonial first pitches at Sunday’s spring training game at George M. Steinbrenner Field between the Tampa Bay Rays and the New York Yankees. \nThat much was true. \nBut they were also told their two catchers would be Yankees players. \nThat was a fib. \nAfter 10-year-old Daniel tossed a strike and 5-year-old Isabella bounced her pitch, the catchers removed their protective masks and unveiled themselves.

I just started crying. I was just like balling my eyes out.” \nElizabeth Gomez captured the moment perfectly: “Nothing beat this reunion,” she said.
