Mr Howe believes that a key point of leverage is the UK’s funds in the European Investment Bank (EIB). The UK has a 16 per cent share of the €63.3bn capital of the bank, amounting to €10.1bn. The guidance concludes: “Overall the UK should be entitled on exit to a net payment in its favour, corresponding to the value of its capital invested in the EIB.” Theresa May is expected to formally trigger Article 50 this week, after the Bill paving the way for Britain’s departure is due to be debated on Monday. I hope Britain will rejoin EU after Brexit , European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker says Jolyon Maugham QC, a barrister who launched a legal challenged last year arguing that Article 50 should be revocable once it is activated , so that the UK would not be forced to accept any Brexit deal, told The Independent he questioned the credibility of Mr Howe’s advice. “ Martin Howe is an odd choice for the Government to be taking advice from, given that he doesn’t specialise in any relevant field. \"To seek out proper advice, you shouldn’t simply go to a lawyer who tells you what you want to hear. \"It’s not clear that the Government are going to act on this advice, but if it did, it would be a fantastically stupid thing to do. Our negotiating strategy is based on legal advice from a man who described the Miller case as \"devoid of all legal merit\".

Relying on World Trade Organisation tariffs would have serious consequences for companies, jobs and food prices, it states. The 36-page report uses language far stronger than that employed in the Treasury's published analysis of Brexit's long-term impact on the economy.
