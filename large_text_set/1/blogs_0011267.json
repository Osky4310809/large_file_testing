How much must the “I” be forsaken, for the service of the “we”? Maybe would even go as far to ask if it must be done at all. It is threatening to become attached to another human being, and more so in modern love than before. Because doing so, means allowing yourself to depend on them, and as a result, opening doors to the possibility of being disappointed and having your heart broken. But, can a relationship survive without some form and amount of dependence? If two people who look out only for themselves, with no give and take between them, come together, where do they go from there? Aren’t relationships supposed to be about looking out for each other, having each other’s back? Cheering each other on? And doing what it takes to keep each other happy? In that vein, doesn’t one’s happiness come to depend on the other? This is where we begin to question how healthy dependence is. We all know that it’s a slippery slope to seat someone else on the driver’s seat of your emotional well-being. But, could there be healthy dependence between lovers? Almost like the kind we have with friends where a cup of coffee with them, or simply talking about our woes, can make things better? Or, when we ask someone to accompany us to watch a play or a movie, because we don’t want to do it alone? Why does depending on a lover for company become unhealthy, when we don’t blink twice before establishing the same with a friend? When we say that dependence can kill a relationship, we miss the fact that it has a detrimental effect only when it becomes unhealthy. That is, when we start depending on the other for solutions, for taking charge over our lives. But, that is not the only way in which we can come to depend on someone else. There can be healthy dependence, the kind that is woven in the very fabric of cohabiting, or courtship. Depending on the other for compliments, for encouragement, for attention, and nourishment. Not only is it healthy, but without it, what do we build the relationship on?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T08:39:44.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
