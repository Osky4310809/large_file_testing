The 28-year-old, who entered with a couple of high-20s finishes and cut this season, hit five birdies on the front nine—all coming in a six-hole stretch from No. 3 to No. 8. He added another birdie on No. 11 that made what seemed like a preordained result a little interesting. Mark Murphy of Golf Channel was cheering on the underdog: Mark Murphy @MarkMurphyGolf 2/12/2017, 7:04:01 PM Fortunately for Spieth, the lead he built through the first 54 holes proved insurmountable. He calmly picked up par after par, saving bad tee shots into the rough at a few points on the back nine, while Kraft's hot streak cooled down. Kraft did not record another birdie after No. 11 and watched on as Spieth did just enough to keep himself ahead. Plus, occasionally, Spieth would do things like this and remind the world why he's won two majors at 23: PGA TOUR @PGATOUR 2/12/2017, 8:14:33 PM The win will help build Spieth's resume among the world's best, which had quietly taken a hit over the last year. Spieth entered this week ranked sixth in the world, behind the likes of Hideki Matsuyama and Henrik Stenson—great players who are often left out of the conversation along with Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Jason Day and Rory McIlroy. Spieth's year had been crescendoing to this point. He had finished ninth or better in every tournament during the current PGA season, including two top-three finishes. All that was left on the table was him actually getting over the hump and getting back to holding a trophy. Johnson finished the event in third at 14-under, while Day was seven strokes behind in a tie for fifth place. Matsuyama, Stenson and McIlroy did not participate. With the Masters less than two months away, nearly all the game's elite are playing at a high level. Pebble Beach just proved that, when he's at the top of his game, Spieth has the talent to lap everyone in the field. Post-Round Reaction Spieth spoke about his conservative style, per Steve DiMeglio of USA Today : \" Today I hit 17 greens, sort of a dream round when you’re leading by a bunch. It was sort of boring golf. ... That was the game plan. We got to every tee box and Michael [Greller, his caddie] said, 'Keep playing boring golf.' I don’t like playing boring golf but it worked out.\" Jeff Babineau of Golfweek provided comments from Spieth's pro-am playing partner, Jake Owen: \" He's a rock star...and I know rock stars.\" Like the new article format? !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:08:16.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
