SUPER BOWL COMMERCIALS : Watch Every Commercial That Aired In Super Bowl LI \nDaisy cautions her team to only take necessary shots, referencing a bomb and that they don’t know what it looks like. When they go in, they take down Anton Ivanov’s enforcer Shockley and some more Watchdogs. \nBack on the Zephyr One Daisy begins interrogating Shockley, revealing the reason for his capture. \nShe mentions that they have footage of Shockley “entering the Senator’s office moments before the blast.” \nShockley retorts, “What do you care? That woman hated the things like you.” \nApparently they’re talking about Senator Ellen Nadeer, one of the antagonists of the season who is also allied with Radcliffe behind the scenes. \nWhether Senator Nadeer died or survived isn’t revealed in the clip, but it does make it seem like everyone thinks she perished. What’s also unclear is the motivation why, seeing that Nadeer teamed with Radcliffe who himself is aligned with the Superior. \nDid those two betray Nadeer? Or did the Superior act of his own volition? Or, and this might be most likely, was Nadeer in on it and faked her own death, using the subversion to lead Phil Coulson and his team into a trap? \nWe’ll find out this Wednesday when Agents of SHIELD: LMD airs on ABC. \nExcited for the episode?
