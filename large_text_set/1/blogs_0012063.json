Could   \nSherlock bosses have admitted they may have filmed the last ever film of the hit BBC drama. \nViewers on Sunday will watch the final episode of the current series called The Final Problem. \nAt a preview screening on Thursday night at London’s BFI, co-creator Steven Moffat took the unusual step of talking about the overall Sherlock project and paying tribute to his wife, the show’s series producer Sue Vertue. \nHe said afterwards: “If this is the last time, we are not planning it might be, it is possible. It could end there. \n“We couldn’t have ended it on any of the previous series because they always ending in walloping great cliffhangers. \n\"If we never come back, there is one thing I would like to say, the boss and number one, is the person to whom I am married. \n“She is the person who runs all the show who either kicks us up the arse or restrains us and made us write it in the first place.” \nFellow co-creator Mark Gatiss sounded emotional introducing the film and with his voice wavering said: “All we can say is this may be the final problem.

It has been an amazing rollercoaster.” \nGatiss also admitted it has “such a finale feel to it”. \nBosses have asked that details of the plot for the episode are kept under wraps but they have teased the episode by stating: “Someone has been playing a very long game indeed and Sherlock and John Watson face their greatest ever challenge. Is the game finally over?” Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock (Photo: BBC) \nThe problem the BBC and the writers have is the two stars of the show are hugely in demand in Hollywood and the UK. \nLead actor Benedict Cumberbatch is extremely busy with seven films currently filming or to be filmed in the future with his name attached to them, making another Sherlock series seemingly impossible before around 2019. \nMartin Freeman is already signed up to make Marvel comic film Black Panther this year.
