Water in one practice pool is orange. Turf has turned brown and, along with countless stadium seats, inexplicably removed from the field. \nAnd that doesn't even begin to describe the situation in Rio's favelas, which were supposed to be cleaned up ahead of the start of the Olympics. Instead, as Gizmodo noted , sewage and feces flow through the streets \"in small rivers.\" \nOf course, none of this should come as much of a surprise. Time and again we have seen Olympic hosts promise that the billions of dollars spent on the two-week spectacle would have a lasting effect on the local economy and its citizens only to watch silently as the venues are abandoned and begin to decay. \nHere's what Rio's Olympic venues look like six months later. The Olympic golf course took three years to make and drew much ire because it was built in a national wildlife reserve. Now it's run-down and empty. Nacho Doce/Reuters The Olympic Village, too, is a ghost town. Nacho Doce/Reuters One practice pool has turned orange, and the structure next to it is quite literally falling apart. Nacho Doce/Reuters Here's a closer look at the eerie orange water ... Pilar Olivares/Reuters ... and the nearby structure, where panels are falling off. Pilar Olivares/Reuters Inside the Aquatic Center, the pool is drained except for some unpleasant standing water.

Pilar Olivares/Reuters Quite symbolically, this set of Olympic rings is half covered. Silvia Izquierdo/AP The famed Maracana Stadium has gone to waste. Nacho Doce/Reuters The turf is brown, and patches are missing. Mario Lobao/AP Seats have been pried from the stands. Silvia Izquierdo/AP In one dugout, a trash can has been overturned and seats are crumbling. Silvia Izquierdo/AP Wires hang in a broadcast booth in the Maracana.

Mario Tama/Getty The beach volleyball venue is used sporadically. Pilar Olivares/Reuters Thousands of favelas residents were displaced during construction of the Olympic venues, and the favelas that were supposed to be improved ahead of time have only gotten worse.
