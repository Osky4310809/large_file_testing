Richard Gordon slams Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente for the minors arrested during the raid on the Fontana Liesure Park and Casino last November. Senate PRIB/Albert Calvelo MANILA, Philippines â€” Sen. Richard Gordon scolded Bureau of Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente on Thursday over 35 Chinese nationals caught in a raid at the Fontana Leisure Park who turned out to be minors. They were among 1,316 Chinese nationals arrested and at the Fontana Leisure Park and Casino in Clark, Pampanga in November 2016 for overstaying and other immigration violations. At the resumption of the Senate blue ribbon committee hearing on alleged bribery of and extortion by Immigration officials, Morente said that 654 detainees have since been released per bail orders. He also said that 35 minors caught in the raid were also released to the Chinese consul. Gordon then reminded the commissioner that Immigration must be strict about letting minors into the country. He said that Immigration usually checks if minors are with parents or guardians and asks for Certificates of Guardianship or Authority. \"Tayo ba hindi mahigpit pag pumapasok? O napapasukan na tayo ng trafficking in minors or women?\" Gordon said. \"Ganyan ba tayo ka lax?\" He added that as the country's gatekeepers, the BI is responsible for letting minors enter a compound for gambling and vices. \"Ang pumapasok ay nagpupunta sa mga gaming or gambling. Pumapasok mga bata, ang daming minors. Hindi niyo chine-check? Alam niyo naman 'pag gaming, may nakasabit na babae 'yan, may kasamang alak, maaaring may kasamang drugs,\" Gordon said. Morente answered that the minors had tourist visas and were allowed into the country because they were with guardians. \"But I guess I have to investigate this,\" Morente said. Gordon then asked if it is a negligence on the part of the commissioner and the bureau to not check whether the company of the minors are their parents. \"When a leader has to check whether his orders are being followed, medyo may problema tayo,\" Gordon said. A source familiar with Immigration procedure told Philstar.com , however, that minors older than 15 years old can be allowed in if there is proof of parental consent to travel and after payment of a fee. The source also said that Immigration officers usually ask tourists about the purpose of their travel, where they will be staying, and for how long. \"Depende sa nationality at profile at style ng officer. May maraming tanong, meron ding [mabilis lang] kasi alam na nila through observation lang na tourist naman talaga,\" the source said. It would be unfair, however, to blame the Bureau of Immigration for minors being found inside Fontana, a privately-run compound licensed by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, the source said. \"Parang pag nang-rape yung foreigner, kasalanan ba namin? Wala kaming enough tao para bantayan movement ng lahat ng aliens,\" the source said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T11:30:42.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
