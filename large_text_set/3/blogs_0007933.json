I can no more officiate at a same-sex wedding than I can buy beer for the alcoholic.\" \nThe state supreme court declined to remove her from her position, based on her long career as a municipal court judge \"for which she is widely respected.\" Her misconduct was an isolated response, the court said, \"to a quickly changing legal landscape, one in which many judges have experienced similar turmoil.\" \nFiring her would \"unnecessarily circumscribe protected expression,\" the majority opinion said. \nHer lawyer, Jim Campbell of the Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom, said the court \"recognized that her honorable beliefs about marriage do not disqualify her from serving her community as a judge, which she has done with distinction for more than two decades. \nTuesday's ruling said every state judicial ethics commission that has considered the question concluded that judges violate codes of judicial conduct when they refuse to perform marriages for same-sex couples.
