This is technology that’s available in other smartphones, too, but, in the case of Apple, the company could upgrade it to support 3D mapping for facial recognition — one rumor that refuses to go away. \nThe report also echoes the rumor that Apple will be ditching the Home button altogether , and instead opt for a fingerprint sensor that is embedded below the display. Additionally, according to sources, Reuters adds that Apple currently has five different teams working on developing wireless technology for the iPhone 8. This is just part of the company’s focus on wireless charging, as it recently joined the group backing the wireless charging technology, Qi: \n“Apple recently joined the group backing Qi. But there are still at least five different groups working on wireless charging technology within Apple, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.” \nFinally, the report echoes a recent rumor that suggests Apple will charge a hefty sum for the iPhone 8 — upwards of $1,000 or more . According to an analyst, this device will be a “ultra-premium device for the real Apple-crazed folks out there who want to stand out.” \nSo, the question is, will you pay for it?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:52:23.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
