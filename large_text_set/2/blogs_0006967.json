I think Brad has shown enough that he's still a strong candidate to be our No. 1 goalkeeper.\" \nHoward, Guzan and more - Ranking the USA's goalkeeper depth chart \nThe U.S. may be forced to rely on Guzan in part due to an injury to Tim Howard, who underwent groin surgery in November. \n\"In the case of Tim Howard, he's moving along pretty well. I believe he's 12 weeks out of surgery,\" Arena said. \"The expectation for him is his full recovery would be between 12 and 16 weeks, so he's on schedule to hopefully start the first week of the Major League Soccer season. \n\"Having said that though, it could be off a couple weeks and perhaps he won't be a candidate for March. Right now he's in the picture and that's a positive.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T20:49:53.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
