Jim Himes of Connecticut said. \nRepublicans wanted to know who is leaking classified information to the press. \nLast month, Flynn was fired as National Security Advisor. Reports surfaced he had undisclosed contacts with the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. \n“Is the investigation into the leak of classified information, has it begun yet?” Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said. \n“I can’t say because I don’t want to confirm that that was classified information,” Comey said. \nDuring the hearing Comey also said the Justice Department has no evidence to support Trump’s claim that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the campaign. \nThe White House said Trump wasn’t being literal, and added that surveillance could happen a variety of ways.
