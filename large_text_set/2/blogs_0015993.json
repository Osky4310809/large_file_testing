It’s valid for 12 months, and you’ll have to sign up between March 1 and March 31 to get it. Keep in mind that you’ll also have to pay a one-time enrollment fee of Rs. 99.\nUsers that won’t opt for the new Jio Prime subscription plan will still be able to make free calls on the network – no roaming charges. However, they won’t be able to browse the web for free anymore.\nSee also: Vodafone might merge with Idea to create largest mobile operator in India 3 weeks ago It is also worth mentioning that Reliance Jio has reached a new milestone. The company now has more than 100 million subscribers. What’s more, Reliance Jio managed to achieve this in just 170 days. This means that it added 7 new members every second for the past 170 days. Impressive.\nMukesh Ambani also said that the Jio network will continue to expand in India. By the end of 2017, it will be present in nearly all cities, towns, and villages, covering 99 percent of the country’s population. The company will also give its customers the option of choosing the highest selling tariff plan of a rival telecom operator and will then offer them 20 percent more data for the same price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:36:29.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
