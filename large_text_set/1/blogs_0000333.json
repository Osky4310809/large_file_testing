The filings include a design for a device which can be rolled, like a newspaper, and book-like model which features a single curved edge similar to what can be found on the Galaxy Note Edge .\nThough the designs are not inherently related to smartphones, they do pertain to handheld smart devices with touch displays, meaning the technology could be suitable for a range of products including phones, tablets or wearables.\nSee also: Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) vs Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) specs comparison 16 hours ago The filings suggest that Samsung is intending to use biometric sensors such as fingerprint/iris scanners on the devices to prevent the units from being opened or unscrolled until unlocked. Patently Mobile also claims that Samsung is considering the use of “voice information, face information, palm line information, vein distribution information, retina information, movement pattern information, such as walking style information, ECG information, and/or palm print information,” to secure the products.\n\n \nSamsung has submitted dozens of patent filings regarding flexible displays since 2009 and while there’s no guarantee that products with this technology will make it to market, experts speculate that such devices would be commercially viable by 2018-2019.\nWhat do you think of the designs? Do these look like products you would be interested in?
