It is exciting times. \n\"Getting tournament experience is massive, as long as everything is aiming towards the long-term objective, we obviously want to be successful and win trophies. So whatever we have to do to get to that, whether it is going down to gain the experience, everyone is happy to do that.\" \nRashford has only scored three Premier League goals this season - the last of which came on September 24 - and has been more often deployed in a wide role to accommodate Zlatan Ibrahimovic as United's central striker. \nBut the forward insists he has developed into a stronger all-round player under Mourinho this term. \n\"I'm a completely different player now compared to where I was this time last season,\" he said. \"People don't always look at that, they look at the results but they don't look at what you do to get the results. When it all comes together people will start to realise. \nIsco rubbishes Barcelona rumours \n\"My overall game [has changed]. I've been playing in wider positions and now me knowing what the forwards wants helps me, and also helps me know that the winger wants when I get in the middle. \n\"The modern-day forward and attacker is not just a number nine or number 10 or just a winger. It is someone who can interchange between the positions if they are needed to. I think I'm a number nine but if I have to move to other positions for certain games it is what you have to do and it is part of your attributes.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T22:29:13.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
