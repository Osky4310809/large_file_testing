Diagnosed as schizophrenic, David has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for years. But after a strange encounter with a fellow patient, he’s confronted with the possibility that the voices he hears and visions might be real. \nIn Marvel Comics canon, David is Professor Charles Xavier’s mutant son. Xavier has been portrayed by Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy in the “X-Men” franchise on the big screen, but the films have yet to introduce Haller into the cinematic universe. \nThe series also stars Rachel Keller, Jean Smart, Katie Aselton, Jeremie Harris, Amber Midthunder, along with Bill Irwin and Aubrey Plaza. \nWatch the trailer below: \nNoah Hawley (“Fargo”) serves as an executive producer, along with Lauren Shuler Donner, Bryan Singer, Simon Kinberg, Jeph Loeb, Jim Chory, and John Cameron. \n“Legion,” which is produced by FX Productions and Marvel Television, will debut its on FX in early 2017 with eight episodes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T21:31:55.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
