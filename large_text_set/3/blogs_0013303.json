Appodeal, meanwhile, is a mobile ad mediation company — in other words, it helps app developers manage multiple ad networks. \nAs a result of the deal, Appodeal says the enterprise version of the Corona framework will be made available for free (other versions were already free), and that the framework will also become open source. At the same time, developers building on Corona won’t be limited to Appodeal — they’ll still be able to use any monetization platform that was previously supported, with the Corona team working to build even more ad partnerships.

Founded as Ansca Mobile in 2008, it was first acquired by Fuse Powered , then by Perk.com , whose co-founder Roj Niyogi bought Corona when he left Perk last year. Niyogi said he will remain involved as a strategic advisor, while the Corona engineering team joins Appodeal. \nThe financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:13:41.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
