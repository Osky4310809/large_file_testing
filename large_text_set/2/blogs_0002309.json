Of course, Star-Lord wooed crowds with his adorable pre-teen debut, but the fearless leader really got fans going with his unabashed dancing skills. Donning a leather jacket and headphones, Star-Lord boogied his way into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But, in another world, the hero may have looked very different. \nOver on Twitter, one of Marvel’s key artists has made a splash after sharing several pieces of concept art regarding Star-Lord. Andy Park has uploaded a couple photos of the hero prior, but the artist shared a new look at Star-Lord’s earliest stages. Surprisingly, the design has Star-Lord looking less groovy and loaded up with more gunmetal. \n“Here's another Starlord design I painted for the first #GuardiansoftheGalaxy This time w/helmet closed like in the comic. I had fun w/these,” Park captioned the photo. \nIn the artwork, fans can see Star-Lord dons a more comic-compliant helmet with illuminated eyes. As for his outfit, the get-up looks more armored and features a leather shoulder guard. Strapped with holsters and more, the figure looks much more threatening than Star-Lord wound up being in the film. And, as fans know, the character’s unassuming style only added to Star-Lord and his charm. \nYou can swipe through the following slides to see all of Park’s recent Star-Lord concept art. \nMORE: James Gunn Releases Another Piece Of The Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 Score / 5 Worlds We Want to Visit in Avengers: Infinity War / Josh Brolin Ready To Transform Into Thanos For Avengers Infinity War / Peter Dinklage's New Hairstyle Hints At Avengers: Infinity War Role / Josh Brolin Ready To Transform Into Thanos For Avengers Infinity War / Who Is Peter Dinklage Playing In Avengers: Infinity War? / Is Peter Dinklage Playing MODOK In Avengers: Infinity War? / Zoe Saldana Confirms Gamora For Avengers: Infinity War / Chris Hemsworth Says He Still Hasn't Seen The Avengers: Infinity War Script / Avengers: Infinity War To Film in Scotland / Avengers: Infinity War Is Casting Extras For Alien Roles / Avengers: Infinity War Sets Production Start Date / Avengers: Infinity War Directors Tease Mysterious New Prop Video \nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos.
