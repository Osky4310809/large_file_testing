(PTI) \nThe BJPs Parliamentary board is likely to meet today todecide chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand where the party won with comfortable majority, results of which were declared yesterday. Speaking to the media persons last evening, party president Amit Shah had said that on Sunday evening the party’s Parliamentary board will meet which will discuss on the future course of action. PM Narendra Modi is also likely to attend the meeting. \nYesterday, the runaway success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s massive campaign success ensured that a BJP man becomes the chief minister. It should be noted here that PM Modi did not allow anyone to be projected as the chief ministerial candidate throughout the assembly elections campaigns. This is usually very counter-productive for any party. \nHowever, for the BJP, this proved a master move as the people voted not for any BJP man in UP, but for Modi himself. He was the face of the campaign and he harvested the votes in his name. But now, BJP is in a quandary as to who to name as the new chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Modi cannot be the CM. The first blow was struck by firebrand BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj , who has time and again shocked with his intemperate statements on women and religion. However, in this time of BJP triumph, he has eschewed these topics and chose to comment on something more pressing at the moment and that is his preference of who will be UP chief minister? \nSpeaking to ABP, Sakshi Maharaj has gone on record to say that a dalit, or in case that is not acceptable, an OBC leader must be picked as the new UP CM. He also argued his case by saying that since there are as many as 20-22 per cent dalits in the state and some 27 per cent OBCs, it only stands to reason that one of these communities must be represented at the top of the power structure in the state. \nA number of people are in the running for the chief minister’s position in UP. However, who will pick the man is known to everyone – PM Narendra Modi. Rumours are the strongest about former UP CM and current Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh , then fiery leader Yogi Adityanath, state BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya and some are even going to the extent of saying dark horse Varun Gandhi. In the running also are Union minister Smriti Irani (when asked, Irani refused to rise to the bait and did not comment on the issue of her being named CM), MoS Manoj Sharma, or even spokesman Shrikant Sharma. There could be others too. And as to answering the question as to who will be CM, then let us just say, may the best man win. Please Wait while comments are loading...
