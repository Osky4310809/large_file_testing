Courtney Martin is a part-time model and criminology student (Photo: Caters) \nThe criminology student and part-time model said her symptoms include stabbing pains, constant nausea and extreme fatigue on a daily basis. \nShe posted the video in the hopes someone might see it and help to find the source of her pain. \nShe said: \"Every morning, I wake up in pain and no one can tell me why. \n\"I keep getting told that because I'm young and healthy, I can learn to deal with it but I don't want to. Courtney said she suffers unbearable pain on a daily basis as a result of her mystery condition (Photo: Caters) \n\"But I feel like an old lady. Every day I'm in unbearable pain and feel constantly nauseous and fatigued. I just want a normal life. \n\"I refuse to accept that there's no one out there that knows what's wrong with me. I hope that person sees this and can help.\" \nAs a result of her unidentifiable chronic pain, Courtney said she finds just waking up a struggle and depends on her mum for support. \nShe said: \"I used to have heaps of energy and was a very social person. I loved visiting friends and even modelled at Melbourne Fashion Week. She posted an emotional video for help to overcome her condition (Photo: Caters) \n\"Now, that part of my life is gone because I'm in too much pain.\" \nShe added: \"This is debilitating, exhausting, draining and consuming all of my energy. \n\"So much that basic daily tasks are too difficult.\" \nCourtney's unidentified health problems began three years ago, when she first started experiencing cramp like pains in her abdomen. \nShe said: \"I'd noticed I had an uncomfortable pain in my lower stomach and at first I thought it was actually a sports injury. The video has been viewed 90,000 times (Photo: Caters) \n\"I went to see my GP who initially thought it was period pain and would pass. \n\"But it just spiralled from there.\" \nDoctors were confident Courtney had endometriosis, a condition that causes the lining of the uterus to grow in other places, but were left stumped when surgery to treat the condition revealed she didn't have it. \nCourtney said: \"My doctor just couldn't understand what was going on when he discovered there wasn't any troublesome tissue inside me. He was so sure that's what it was. \n\"Since then, doctors haven't even come close to uncovering what's causing the pain. Courtney, pictured with her partner, said she once had heaps of energy and was a very social person (Photo: Caters) \n\"I've been tested for auto-immune diseases, psychological conditions and have even had my appendix removed but the pain is still there. \n\"I'm constantly in and out of hospital in agony and things are only getting worse.\" Read More Horrifying photos show how meningitis rash grew from a 'few dots' to cover baby's whole body in 24 hours \nShe added: \"The reality is doctors just don't know why I'm in so much pain, which makes it even harder to live with. \n\"I've lost count of the times I've gone to bed, hoping I don't wake up because my life isn't worth living as it is. \n\"I can't work, I can't play sport, I can't even eat some days. It's unbearable. \n\"Doctors think because I'm young, I can learn to cope with it. \n\"But what sort of life is that? I refuse to believe that no one can help me. There must be someone out there who knows what is wrong.\" Read More Young woman who could go blind at any time due to cruel condition urges other sufferers to 'fight back' \nSince Courtney uploaded her video to Facebook it has been viewed almost 90,000 times. \nShe said: \"I don't want money and I'm not fundraising for treatment. All I'm asking for, is help. \n\"My hope is that a doctor or someone else going through what I'm going through sees it, and can then finally explain to me what is going on. \n\"I shouldn't have to live like this.
