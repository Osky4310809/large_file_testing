Another 308,985 compounds were issued under Pay and Display (PND), while 4,382 were for vehicles that were towed away by the council and 2,988 for wheel clamping. \nAccording to Mohd Azizi, the enforcement action taken was in accordance with the respective enactment and by-laws of the offence committed.
