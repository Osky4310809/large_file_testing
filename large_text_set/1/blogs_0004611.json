Share \n\"I love the quiet confidence about him,\" USC head coach Clay Helton said after the win, per ESPN.com's Kyle Bonagura . \"You never saw his demeanor change tonight. Whether he was throwing a touchdown or whether we got stopped on offense, you just never saw his demeanor change.\" \nWith some new hardware to his name and all of the traits necessary to be one of the nation's top quarterbacks, Darnold should continue to watch his star rise when he returns to the Trojans for his redshirt sophomore season. \nConsidering the way USC rounded out its 2016 campaign, it won't be a surprise to see the Rose Bowl champs perched near the top of the 2017 Associated Press preseason rankings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T02:54:01.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
