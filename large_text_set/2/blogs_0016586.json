But since his comment about Africa, the tides have changed, and a lot of people would prefer to do without him.\nboycotting @COVERGIRL until @jamescharles is removed. Racism is not a cute look on anybody :)\n— Louisa Lorde (@HoneyLuLu_) February 16, 2017 \n\nWhile neither James nor CoverGirl immediately apologized, the brand eventually came out with their own version of a statement: a photo of the male model hugging Zendaya, taken from their 10-minute makeup challenge video.\nYouTube / Jason Ikeler Ah, yes. How could we forget? He hung out with a Black person once, remember? He even hugged her. Obviously he can’t be racist if he got along with her, right?\nPeople were understandably upset by CoverGirl’s apology — or lack thereof — and took to Twitter to let the company know.\na play in four acts pic.twitter.com/eSCplXDN6W \n— ㅤ (@poedamcron) February 18, 2017 \njames charles: i have a black friend\nzendaya: pic.twitter.com/qbMGk5pDhI \n— seciley (@rileytharvey) February 17, 2017 \nJames charles is annoying and zendaya does better makeup and thats not even her career\n— quayci (@klances) February 16, 2017 \n\nEven Zendaya didn’t hold back from saying something through a well-picked meme.\nMood pic.twitter.com/1BAycfTfpB \n— Zendaya (@Zendaya) February 16, 2017 \n\nJames eventually apologized himself via — you guessed it — Twitter.\nI am extremely sorry.
