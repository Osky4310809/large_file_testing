But Senator Bernie Sanders pointed out that Trump said he wouldn't do it in certain ways. Senator Sanders printed out a Trump tweet from 2015 where he promised not to cut Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security. This is the first of many times when what Donald Trump has said could either be backed up with action or not. We demand that Donald Trump keep his word and commit to veto anything that would cut Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security. Senator Sanders went on to say:\n\"Millions of people voted for him on the belief that he would keep his word. If he was sincere, then I would hope that tomorrow or maybe today he could send out a tweet to tell his Republican colleagues to stop wasting their timeâ€¦and to tell the American people that he will veto any proposal that cuts Medicare, that cuts Medicaid, that cuts Social Security.\" Millions of people will suffer if we don't hold Donald Trump to his word on this topic. Please sign to tell the President-Elect you expect him to veto anything of this kind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:31:59.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
