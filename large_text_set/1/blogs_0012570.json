Immediately after water exposure, the skin is maximally hydrated, and while some of that hydration will evaporate quickly, moisture levels can be sealed in with a thick moisturizer.\"\nLighter moisturizers will suffice in the spring and summer, since there's more humidity in the air. For the colder months ahead, though, you'll want to swap in a heavier-duty option.\n\"In general, a winter moisturizer should be a thicker cream rather than a gel or serum-type moisturizer, unless your skin is oily,\" Dr. Tanzi said.\nEveryone's skin is different. Some people are prone to getting blemishes, while others have extremely dry skin year- round. There's no miracle moisturizer that works wonders on all skin types. So we talked with Dr. Tanzi about the key ingredients to look for in a winter moisturizer and found great options for every skin type. Have a look:\nView As: One Page Slides Dry skin Amazon Indicators: Your skin is often itchy, flaky, or generally tight\nProduct to try: It's especially important to hydrate your skin when the climate is against your favor. Dr. Tanzi recommends using a cream with shea butter, a natural ingredient that is incredibly moisturizing and keeps inflammation at bay. This option from L'Occitane has a high concentration of shea butter, so a little will go a long way.\nL'Occitane Shea Ultra Rich Comforting Face Cream, $34, available at Amazon.\nOily skin Amazon Indicators : Large, visible pores and a greasy sheen that develops quickly after you've cleansed\nProduct to try: You want to find a formula that's just right for your face. Too weak and it won't hydrate your skin, but too strong and your skin will appear even more oily. Baxter of California's oil-free moisturizer is lightweight, so it won't clog up your pores, and includes dimethicone, an ingredient that soaks up excess grease and gives your face a matte finish.\nBaxter of California Oil Free Moisturizer, $24\nCombination skin Kiehl's Indicators: An oily T-Zone — your forehead, nose, and chin — alongside drier skin on your cheeks\nProduct to try: Finding a cream that complements your skin's unique makeup is no easy feat, but that doesn't mean you're exempt from moisturizing. \" Most people with combination skin do well with a light lotion or cream,\" Dr. Tanzi said. Kiehl's Facial Fuel keeps your skin soft without the oily aftermath.\nKiehl's Facial Fuel, $25-$42\nAcne-prone skin Indie Lee Indicators: Your skin is red, irritated, or prone to blemishes\nProduct to try: If you're constantly dealing with irritations or pimples, Dr. Tanzi recommends using a moisturizer with h yaluronic acid. \"It's a lightweight, hydrating ingredient that won’t clog pores,\" she said. Indie Lee's cream uses h yaluronic acid and squalane oil to nourish your skin and minimize pores. Fresh’s cream claims it can give your skin 24-hour moisture and is $30 less.\nFresh Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream, $40\nIndie Lee Squalane Facial Cream, $70\nNormal skin Amazon Indicators: An even skin tone with no flaking, redness, or sheen, and only the occasional breakout\nProduct to try: A little bit of cream is all you'll need. To keep your skin clear, healthy, and hydrated, Dr. Tanzi recommends selecting an formula with ceramides or hyaluronate. This cream has both key ingredients along with a couple others that prevent cell DNA damage, irritation, and UV exposure.\nDr. Jart+ Ceramidin Cream, $40.27\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
