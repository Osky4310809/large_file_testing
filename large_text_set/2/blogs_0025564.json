It looks like that [he] will not be ready for Arsenal. That's how it looks. I'm not sure. We will see.\" \nEmre Can deputised for Henderson in the deep-lying midfield role in the defeat to a managerless Leicester, with Henderson missing just his second Premier League match of the season. \nLiverpool welcome Arsene Wenger's side to Anfield on Saturday evening, hoping to get their quest to finish in the top four back on track. \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
