Romeo Galgo, the spokesperson of the Central Mindanao Police Office said. ADVERTISEMENT \nGalgo said the operation was carried out by policemen, elements of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), and soldiers, who were backed by nine warrants. \nKrislam is a known haven for illegal drug pushers, according to Senior Inspector Ronnie Cordero, Kabacan town police chief. \nCordero said aside from suspected shabu, also seized were various brands of motorcycles after law enforcers found out that these had no registration documents. \nHe said police also found disassembled motorcycle parts. \nThe arrested suspects have been undergoing interrogation and those caught with illegal substance and other contraband would be charged, Cordero said. \nThe Krislam raid took place a few hours after anti-drug agents raided the house of a suspected drug lord in Talitay, Maguindanao. \nBryan Babang, the director of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (PDEA-ARMM), said suspected drug trafficker Madatu Buisan and two of his cohorts eluded arrest during the raid conducted late Wednesday . \nBut Buisan’s wife, Arbaya, was taken into custody after the raiding team found in her possession sachets of suspected shabu. \nSeized from Buisan’s home were a customized Bush Master assault rifle; an M203 rifle fitted with a launcher for 40-millimeter grenade projectiles; 11 shoulder-fired grenades and 21 ammunition magazines. \nBabang said they also confiscated more than P20,000 in cash proceeds from drug deals, bank receipts showing more than P100,000 in remittances to shabu suppliers, whom he did not name. \nTalitay had been publicly identified by President Rodrigo Duterte as among havens of illegal drugs in Maguindanao and named its mayor, Montassir Sabal, as among the country’s biggest “narcopoliticians.” Sabal, who denied the charges, went into hiding after Duterte made public his name as a drug lord.
