Last year, Kangana alleged how Hrithik and she were in a relationship and they had shared a lot of personal emails during this period. Hrithik rubbished this news, mentioned how an imposter was emailing her and sent her a legal notice demanding an apology. Kangana filed a counter case against the superstar and the whole scenario became an murky affair with neither of them backing out. \nA year later too, Kangana has still not forgotten the incident.During an interview for the cover story of L’Officiel India, Kangana asked a very strong question, “Why should I apologise when I have not done anything wrong? If he (Hrithik Roshan) believes there is an imposter let him bring that person in front of the world.” Well, we have to give a round of applause to the actress who is fighting so fearlessly against the world. The actress looks stunning on the cover of L’Officiel and while we were amazed by her photoshoot, her gutsy replies during her interview left us stunned.

For those of you who don’t remember, Adhyayan had made some really shocking revelations about Kangana during her legal tussle. In an interview to DNA, he had said, “My mother was very worried and she called the family’s Panditji to come home and meet me. The first thing he asked me was, ‘Khana banati hai tumhare liye?’ When I said yes, he said, ‘Apna impure blood milati hai khaane mein black magic ke liye.'” Kangana has strongly reacted to both Hrithik and Adhyayan.
