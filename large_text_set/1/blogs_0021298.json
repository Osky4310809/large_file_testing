The statement read: \n\"This rape was broadcast live on a Facebook group and numerous people have been in touch regarding seeing this broadcast. The police went to said apartment, and in the apartment were three men and a woman. The three men were detained on the spot and then arrested by prosecutors at 2:30pm on Sunday.\" \nDeputy Chief prosecutor Magnus Berggren told CNN the men remained in custody as of Tuesday and the case was still being investigated. \nBerggren said the Facebook group where the rape was live streamed was a private group \"where you could post rather special things. Even for that group this was not anything normal.\" \nThe official also confirmed local reports that the woman was not fully conscious, adding: \n\"She was intoxicated. We're not really sure how.\" \nSo terrifying. \nThe police said the men arrested were born in 1992, 1996, and 1998 — putting them all in the age range between 19 and 25. The woman was born in 1986, pinning her at around 31 years old. \nBerggren assured that the footage has been removed, however urged anyone with access to the tape to send it to the police. Prosecutors have been in touch with Facebook for assistance in the case. \nA spokesperson for the social media side blasted the \"hideous crime\" in a statement to CNN , saying: \n\"This is a hideous crime and we do not tolerate this kind of content on Facebook. We support local law enforcement who make data requests related to criminal investigations, particularly when it comes to the safety of young people. We respond to valid requests relating to criminal cases.\" \nNo charges have been filed just yet, but the case is being treated as one of aggravated rape. \nWe're glad these degenerates will be punished for their repugnant actions and hope the victim recovers from this trauma .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:48:17.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
