His actions are almost certainly linked to FBI Director James Comey’s impending testimony before Congress. James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 \nIronically, Comey has been accused by Democrats like former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada of improperly swaying the 2016 election toward Trump by mentioning that he would revisit Hillary Clinton’s emails even though there was little proved to be no reason for doing so. \nComey is expected to testify before Congress on Monday about President Trump’s claim that Trump Tower was wiretapped by   during the election. According to ABC News , he is expected to debunk those claims within the first few minutes of his testimony. \nDuring an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, the House Intelligence Committee’s ranking Democrat California Rep. Adam Schiff said that he expects Comey will “put an end to this wild goose chase.” \n“What the president said is patently false and the wrecking ball it created has now banged into the British allies and German allies and continuing to grow in terms of damage,” Schiff added. \nComey may also discuss whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russian government officials to try to hurt Clinton’s campaign and help Trump’s, a suspicion that has been exacerbated by a number of ties between individuals connected to Trump and both Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and WikiLeaks founders Julian Assange. \n“If Comey acknowledges the investigation, it could balloon into a scandal for the still-young Trump administration,” wrote The New York Times on Monday .
