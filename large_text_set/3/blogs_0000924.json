John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, told Fox News . “The DOJ is the last place this should have occurred.” \nThe investigation, run by the House Judiciary Committee, found a series of nonprofit organizations involved in activism that were used to transfer funds. \nMore than $3 billion – linked to the practice – has reportedly been accounted for by investigators. \nThe revelation drew attention to other laundering stories including allegations that the U.S. State Department under Obama funneled cash to campaign funds. \nOther reports from last year also revealed taxpayer funds intended to bolster peace efforts between Israel and Palestine were instead used against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n“The State Department awarded nearly $350,000 to OneVoice, a nonprofit that completed its peace project in 2014 and then handed over its resources to Victory15, an Israeli PAC trying to oust Netanyahu in the 2015 election, said the Senate’s permanent subcommittee on investigations,” The New York Post reported last July.
