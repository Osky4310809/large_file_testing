After asking him again, Lord replied by saying he just said that Trump made a mistake on his Electoral College win. \n“Is that good?” Lord asked, with a flustered Cooper moving on to another panelist. \nWatch the exchange above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:40:38.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
