The Foxes look desperately short of confidence Ranieri's men remain in the relegation dogfight (Photo: Getty) \nLeicester’s heads dropped when they conceded the first goal against Manchester United last weekend. Well, today was no different. The Foxes had no reply after Mawson opened the scoring. \nJamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, Leicester’s key men in their Premier League triumph last season, were anonymous throughout the game and like most of their team-mates, looked incredibly short of confidence. It seems to be the case that when Vardy and Mahrez aren't on song, the team do not perform. \nBut now is the time for Leicester’s two main stars to step up. 2. While Leicester’s losing streak continues, their away form is the main concern Vardy drew another blank (Photo: Stu Forster) \nThe demoralising defeat in Wales for Ranieri’s men means Leicester are still waiting for a first victory in 2017. \nBut today’s result stretched their winless run on the road to 15 league games. The Foxes’ last away-day victory came in their title-winning run-in at Sunderland in April - they have lost nine and drawn five since. \nBurnley are the only other Premier League team without an away win this term, but they have had a superb home record to rely on. \nLeicester need to start picking up points, whether that is at home or away, sooner rather than later. 3. Clement has transformed Mawson into a goal-scoring machine Mawson's stunner was his third in six games (Photo: AFP) \nMawson has netted three times since Clement arrived at the Liberty Stadium last month, and the former Barnsley defender’s latest strike was his best yet. Kasper Schmeichel stood no chance trying to keep the youngster’s fierce volley out. \nMawson has now scored more goals this season (3) than Manchester United and England skipper Wayne Rooney (2). At the moment, it is easy to see why he is Swansea’s biggest threat in the box. And at only 23, Mawson has the potential to be a top centre-back in the Premier League. 4. Failure to bring in a centre-back in January is costing Leicester Martin Olsson's goal sealed the deal (Photo: REUTERS) \nLeicester’s firm backline was a contributing factor in their fairytale season last year, with Wes Morgan and Robert Huth proving many doubters wrong. \nRanieri opted not to bring in another experienced centre-back in the summer, and given Huth and Morgan’s form, you could not really argue against it. But the veteran duo have struggled massively this term and eyebrows were raised when the Italian coach decided to shell out £15m on midfielder Wilfred Ndidi in January, and not bring in a much-needed defender. \nHuth and Morgan had another day to forget as they could not deal with Swansea’s forwards. 5. Swansea are reaping the rewards for finally having some consistency in their starting line-up Clement's side are up to 15th in the Premier League table (Photo: Plumb Images) \nPart of Clement’s predecessor Bob Bradley’s disastrous 11-game spell in charge was the constant changes to his starting XI. The ex-USA boss would make five, six and sometimes even seven changes to his team per game. But in stark contrast, Clement made a first alteration to his Swansea team in three games, with Nathan Dyer coming in for Wayne Routlegde. And it is that consistency in the Swans’ starting eleven which has helped them climb out of the relegation zone. poll loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T20:33:54.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
