Vaani Kapoor walked the ramp for designer Rina Dhaka’s autumn-winter offering and the millennial-approved actress took to her duties as the showstopper in a one-shoulder black velvet gown, featuring a waist cut-out (apt for her envy-inducing supermodel abs) and a thigh-high side slit. Softly tousled middle-parted hair in place, she sported a nude-pink hue lip; a stark contrast to her dramatic eyes that she seamlessly worked through. With this, Vaani also gave a generous peek into mastering the one-shoulder trend that is well on its way to rule trend-thirsty closets. Rina Dhaka’s autumn-winter collection, set against a backdrop of dark romance, channelled a mysterious vibe in feminine evening dresses that were replete with sheer, velvet and vintage florals. The mood was kept decidedly sinister, although never lacking with its intent to spell out grown-up glamour. Case in point, the unsparing use of lurex. The ultra-luxe numbers, both in their construction and appearance, were fit for a rich girl on a covert mission – always glamourous but never without restraint.
