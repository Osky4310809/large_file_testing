In court documents obtained by ET, the Flip or Flop star has asked that Christina pay him spousal support, and that the court's ability to award alimony to her be terminated. Tarek is also requesting that Christina pay for his attorney's fees. In the divorce petition he filed on Monday at the Orange County Superior Court, Tarek also asks for joint legal and physical custody of his and Christina's two children, 6-year-old daughter Taylor and 1-year-old son Brayden. ET has reached out to Tarek's attorney and rep for comment. Tarek and Christina announced their separation one month ago, in December, where they revealed that they had broken up after a heated fight that led to the police being called to their Orange County, California, home in May. \"Like many couples, we have had challenges in our marriage,\" they said in a joint statement to ET at the time. \"We had an unfortunate misunderstanding about six months ago and the police were called to our house in an abundance of caution. There was no violence and no charges were filed.\" WATCH: 'Flip or Flop' Star Christina El Moussa Reflects on 'Crazy' 2016: 'A Lot of Things Have Changed' The HGTV couple went on to say that they \"sought counseling\" but decided to separate to reevaluate \"the future of our marriage.\" Later in December, the couple explained that in addition to remaining committed to their children, they also plan to continue working together. \"We have both dated other people following the separation, but neither of us is ready to announce anything in terms of another relationship,\" Tarek and Christina told People. \"We plan to continue our professional life together by being professional, by doing our jobs well, by being prepared and by working hard,\" the former couple added.
