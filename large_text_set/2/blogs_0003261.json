MAN UTD HAVE DE VRIJ AGREEMENT \nManchester United look set to beat Chelsea to the signing of Stefan De Vrij after they found a verbal €35 million agreement with Lazio, writes Il Messaggero . \nThe Netherlands defender has been tracked by Jose Mourinho on the back of his impressive performances for Lazio this term, and Chelsea will need to pip their Old Trafford rivals' offer if they are to stand any chance of securing his signature. RAKITIC BEGINS RENEWAL TALK \nBarcelona have made significant steps to tying Ivan Rakitic down to a new deal until 2022 after meeting his agent on Friday, claims Marca . \nThe Croatian's future has come under scrutiny of late after he was dropped by Luis Enrique, but the trainer has insisted that he remains a key part of the Catalans' plans and urged the club to extend his stay at Camp Nou. SPURS MADE MAHREZ INQUIRY \nTottenham made an inquiry as to the availabilty of Leicester City winger during the January transfer window, according to The Times . \nMauricio Pochettino was keen to bring the Algeria international to White Hart Lane, but Spurs were told the player was not for sale at any price so did not make a bid.

MILAN COULD MAKE BRAVO BID \nAC Milan have identified Claudio Bravo as their main option to replace Gianluigi Donnarumma should the goalkeeper leave the San Siro this summer, Sport Mediaset reports. \nBravo has come under scrutiny at Manchester City for his poor displays after replacing the ousted Joe Hart as the first-choice keeper.

LIVERPOOL EYE INTER GOALKEEPER \nLiverpool are interested in signing Inter shot-stopper Samir Handanovic as Jurgen Klopp looks to resolve the Reds' goalkeeping issues, according to Corriere dello Sport via TalkSport . \nBoth Simon Mignolet and summer-signing Loris Karius have endured tough spells between the sticks at Anfield this season. \nAnd Liverpool boss Klopp sees Slovenian Handanovic as a potential replacement ahead of next season.

REAL MADRID SET FOR AGUERO SWOOP \nReal Madrid are lining up a serious approach for unsettled Manchester City star Sergio Aguero, according to the Mirror . \nThe Argentine has struggled to adapt to life under Pep Guardiola and now faces further competition from Gabriel Jesus up front. And with both Karim Benzema and Alvaro Morata possibly leaving in the summer, Madrid see Aguero as a fine addition to their star-studded forward line in 2017-18.
