This specific window doesn’t immediately jump out as the time of the week that’s most accommodating for doing the nasty, let alone even the hottest time of the weekend, what with church, brunch, hangovers, and morning breath all factoring in to make early Sundays decidedly unsexy . Nevertheless, a survey out of the United Kingdom just found that 9 a.m. on Sunday is the most popular time for having sex , while couples consider 9 p.m. on a Tuesday the biggest sex dead zone. Maybe because everyone’s too busy watching This Is Us ? \nThis survey was commissioned by a British company called Superdrug, which produces lubes and thus are probably curious to know what time people like to use lubes. Researchers at Superdrug pried into the sex lives of 2,000 British long-term couples to arrive at their findings, which also included people’s most desirable season for sex (summer, predictably) and the most popular pre-sex activity (a romantic meal and not, sadly, a game of Jenga). But back to that Sunday morning thing.
