You can create balloon bombs to send floating into an enemy camp, sneak in at night and steal their weapons so it doesnâ€™t matter if they raise an alarm, or use the call for your horse to distract guards. Everything works as it should in the real world, from metal items conducting electricity (put your sword away in a thunderstorm!) to the pull of gravity on every object, and all of this is used in both combat and pre-designed puzzles.\nBreath Of The Wild is not just different mechanically from previous games but structurally too. Thereâ€™s no preset path and the main thrust of your quest involves completing a task in each of the four corners of the map, which can be done in any order. Youâ€™re not told what you have to do for each of them or even specifically where to go, and itâ€™s so easy to get sidetracked with other things that it was over 20 hours before we even started to think about tackling one of them. And that was us in a hurry to get this review done.\nThe main quest does involve a small number of what are essentially traditional Zelda style dungeons. But theyâ€™re shorter than normal and, apart from boss battles, focused almost entirely on puzzle solving. This is clearly to stop the problem in previous Zeldas where the overworld felt merely like an insubstantial interlude between each dungeon. But it also gives the designers an excuse to up the difficulty and to add in 120 optional shrines.\n\nFinding a shrine creates a fast travel point but completing it rewards you with an item which can go toward increasing your maximum health or stamina. Shrines vary considerably in difficulty and focus, with many different puzzle styles and some that are based around combat or platforming. Thereâ€™s always an extra chest with a valuable item too, for that extra challenge.\nThe other major gameplay element is the resource-gathering and crafting. There are no hearts to restore your health and instead you have to collect plants and hunt animals (although the latter isnâ€™t mandatory) to cook meals or potions that not only restore health but add buffs such as heat resistance or increased attack power. This almost seems like a game in itself, as you collect the ingredients to make everything from a mushroom salad to a fruit loaf. If youâ€™re not interested then basic recipes take only seconds to make, but the whole feature is a useful way to unwind between quests and consider the strategy of your next move.\nAs usual in Zelda the story is very minimal. But it begins with Link waking from a century-long sleep and takes a surprisingly maudlin tone during the occasional cut scenes. The formal storytelling still only takes up a tiny percentage of the whole game, but for arguably the first time Link and Zelda are portrayed as real characters, even if the former remains entirely mute. Most of the dialogue is still plain text but the most important sequences do feature proper voiceovers. The acting is not always great, but the mix of styles works well enough.\n<img data-attachment-id=\"6483388\" data-permalink=\"http://metro.co.uk/?attachment_id=6483388\" data-orig-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/146703_zelda_presentation2017_scrn10.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&strip=all\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild (Switch) – you can buy your own house in this village\" data-image-description=\"<p>The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild (Switch) – you can buy your own house in this village</p> \" data-medium-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/146703_zelda_presentation2017_scrn10.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&strip=all\" data-large-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/146703_zelda_presentation2017_scrn10.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1024&strip=all\" class=\"img-align-center size-full wp-image-6483388\" src=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/146703_zelda_presentation2017_scrn10.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&strip=all\" alt=\"The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild (Switch) - you can buy your own house in this village\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></a></div><figcaption>The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild (Switch) – you can buy your own house in this village</figcaption></figure> By now weâ€™ve outlined the basics of what Breath Of The Wild is and how it works, but weâ€™ve still only scratched the surface of why we think itâ€™s one of the best games ever made. To put things dispassionately itâ€™s the level of detail and flexibility the game world offers. But the way that manifests is through the countless unforeseeable events and stories that lie around every corner. From your first falling to star to spotting smoke signals in the distance and wandering who theyâ€™re from, the game has an almost infinite capacity to surprise and delight.\nBreath Of The Wild provides an endless stream of incidental moments that stick in the mind, like exchanging words with a desert-dwelling Gerudo woman as she runs through the rain looking for shelter, appalled at the unfamiliar climate of a forested area. Or stumbling across a party of horseback-riding monsters as they hunt, then stealing one of their horses, breaking it in and taking it back to a stable where you can examine its stats and name it if you decide to keep it.\nThe open world manages to seem like a vast sandbox and an intricately designed puzzle all at the same time. Thereâ€™s something new to see and do at almost every step and yet somehow the game is able to have its cake and eat it: giving the impression youâ€™re exploring untouched wilderness, that no-one but you has ever laid eyes on, and yet also a landscape where every tree and boulder has been placed with the utmost care and forethought.\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/6LIq8ryhG9c?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>\nNone of this should necessarily be seen as a validation of the Nintendo Switch though. Breath Of The Wild was originally designed for the Wii U and the only difference between the two versions is slightly improved performance and resolution on the Switch. Breath Of The Wild can be a stunning-looking game at time, with some excellent lighting techniques, but itâ€™s also filled with some very simple textures and geometry; which become more obvious the less vegetation there is around. Although how much that is due to the Wii U origins is impossible to say at this point.\nThere are also some very minor frame rate issues, although our only real complaint about the graphics is the desaturated colour scheme. The effect varies depending on the time of day and weather but at its worst it made us pine for the more sumptuous colours of Skyward Sword. And while some may be taken aback by the understated soundtrack, it sensibly keeps itself in check until moments of high tension and mixes perfectly with the ambient noises of the world around you.\nFinding fault with Breath Of The Wild is almost the hardest task in the whole game (almost, since it is surprisingly difficult and the game over screen will become a constant companion until you find your feet). The new Zelda is an outstanding achievement in video game design, even by the standards of the franchise. But the size and scope of the adventure, and the freedom youâ€™re given to create your own stories and cherished memories, makes this the best Zelda thereâ€™s ever been.\nAnd thatâ€™s no small compliment, because that immediately confirms it as one of the best games ever made. Only hindsight will be able to decide whether itâ€™s literally the best, but this not only breathes new life into series, and Nintendoâ€™s new console, but into future expectations for all video games to come.\n<div class=\"metro-factbox full\"> <h3 class=\"metro-factbox-title grey tldr\">The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild</h3> <div class=\"metro-factbox-content grey\"></p> <strong>In Short:</strong> The best Zelda thereâ€™s ever been, and very possibly the best video game ever made.\n<strong>Pros:</strong> Incredible attention to detail and interactivity at every level, from the massive open world to the exciting combat, intricate puzzles, clever AI, and charming dialogue.\n<strong>Cons:</strong> Desaturated colour scheme can spoil the look of the visuals. You canâ€™t rename Link.\n<strong>Score:</strong> 10/10\n</div> </div> \nFormats: Nintendo Switch (reviewed) and Wii U\nPrice: ÂŁ59.99\nPublisher: Nintendo\nDeveloper: Nintendo EPD\nRelease Date: 3rd March 2017\nAge Rating: 12\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/j3XmVt27RI4?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>\n<em>EmailÂ <a href=\"mailto:gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\">gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk</a>, leave a comment below, andÂ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DJGameCentral\">follow us on Twitter</a></em>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T13:02:33.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
