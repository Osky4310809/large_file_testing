to a Quebec anglophone Tuesday in Sherbrooke.\n“Yes, we have received complaints,” said commission spokesperson Nelson Kalil. “We’ll be taking a look.\n“We would be investigating the PCO’s (Privy Council Office) involvement and whether or not there was an obligation to provide services (in French and English).”\nRelated Question (in English) about finding service in English in Quebec — Justin Trudeau replies in French Trudeau says he ‘maybe’ could have spoken some English at Quebec town hall It is not known who registered the complaints as the law allows people to lodge them confidentially.\nIronically, Justin Trudeau’s late father, Pierre Trudeau, is considered the father of official bilingualism in Canada and now his son is facing questions about a possible violation of the Official Languages Act that stipulates Canadians have the right to communicate with and receive services from federal institutions in either official language.\nThat was not the case Tuesday evening at a town hall held at Sherbrooke’s manège militaire, where Trudeau — holding a town hall style meeting as part of his national listening tour — refused to answer half a dozen questions in English, including one about the need to get access to mental health care services.\n“Thank you for using our country’s two official languages,” Trudeau replied in French to Judy Ross who asked about health services.\n“But since we’re in Quebec, I’ll respond in French.”\nShaken, Ross said later she felt disrespected and disappointed.\nInformed of the complaints late Wednesday, officials in Trudeau’s office said the prime minister answered questions about the event at his news conference earlier, and had nothing more to add about the matter, which sparked a storm of protests from groups representing anglophones.\nRyan Remiorz / Canadian Press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau peers out from behind the counter at a smoked meat restaurant, Wednesday, January 18, 2017 in L'Ile-Perrot, Quebec On Wednesday Trudeau at first defended his behaviour saying he answered a question asked in French in English in Ontario at the start of his tour.\n“I will always defend official bilingualism,” he said. “I believe deeply in it, but I understand the importance of speaking French and defending the French language in Quebec.”\nHe changed his tune later when a reporter asked again while on a stop in a Tim Horton’s on the campus of Bishop’s University in Lennoxville, a borough of Sherbrooke.\n“So yes I should maybe have answered partly in English and party in French,” Trudeau said. “Upon reflection, it would have been a good thing to do.\nRyan Remiorz / Canadian Press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau waves to supporters after a stop on his cross Canada tour Wednesday, January 18, 2017 in Granby, Quebec “I am always very sensitive to this. I went into the assembly with the principle I was going to do it in French. From now on, I will make sure to have more bilingualism, regardless of where I am in the country.””\nHe said he was surprised by the number of English questions.\nThat attempt to make amends did little to calm the fury of minority groups who demanded Trudeau apologize.\n“The response should have been an apology, this response is an excuse,” said James Shea, president of the Quebec Community Groups Network, which regroups 51 English-language community organizations from across Quebec.\n“The prime minister of Canada knew what he was doing. He chose to answer a question in English in French. Even staunch defenders of the French language like René Lévesque would never have made such a misstep.”\nGerald Cutting, president of the Townshippers’ Association, representing township anglophones, also called on Trudeau to apologize to the English-speaking community.\nIf all Canadians are equal then at least we deserve an answer in our own language\n“If all Canadians are equal then at least we deserve an answer in our own language,” Cutting, who was present at the event, said.\n“During the whole time that the prime minister was in the meeting, he didn’t say one word in English, not even in his opening remarks.”\nThe group’s reaction comes on top of a stinging rebuke issued by Robert Libman, the former leader of the old Equality Party, a defunct English rights group. Libman said Pierre Trudeau, must be must be spinning in his grave because of his son’s behaviour.\nLibman said Trudeau’s refusal “is a transparent attempt to curry favour with Quebec nationalists and score cheap political points in the province.”\nLibman said it’s the second time in the past month that Trudeau “denigrated” the historical presence of Quebec’s English-speaking population. The same thing happened during the Ottawa-Gatineau bilingualism debate where he said “Quebec has to be French in order for Canada to be bilingual.”\nLibman said Trudeau’s attitude showed a disconnect with mainstream modern Quebec, which is “no longer gripped with the same language insecurities of the past.”\nRyan Remiorz / Canadian Press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau picks up poses with customers as he visits a restaurant Wednesday, January 18, 2017 in Granby One issue to be verified in the investigation is whether the event should be considered a government function or a political function, Kalil noted.\nThe prime minister made a brief, 20-minute stop at Smoke Meat Pete in Île-Perrot Wednesday afternoon, but took no questions from the public or the media as he squeezed his way through the crowd gathered at the popular eatery.\nHe shook hands, held babies aloft and joked with the customers in French and in English, accommodating every request for a selfie, before heading out.\nAn attempt to scrum the prime minister was blocked by body guards.\n\nWith files from Kathryn Greenaway \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T16:46:37.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
