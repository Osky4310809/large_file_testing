I am concerned that the bill lacks sufficient safeguards for verifying whether or not an individual applying for health care tax credits is lawfully in this country and eligible to receive them,” he said. \n“Under Obamacare, a half a million people received a total of $750 million in health care subsidies, even though the recipients could not prove their lawful presence in the United States,” he added. “I cannot vote for a replacement plan that fails to address this problem.” \nA measure aimed at addressing Barletta’s concerns was removed from the bill after the Senate Parliamentarian determined that the Senate Finance Committee, which is responsible for tax credits under the bill, does not have purview over the Department of Homeland Security. \nBarletta joins most of the nearly 29 members of the House Freedom Caucus, as well as non-caucus members Representative Ted Budd of North Carolina and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, in opposing the bill, raising the prospect of Speaker Ryan losing in a landslide. \nKentucky Senator Rand Paul, a vocal opponent of the bill, indicated he believes there are at least 35 House Republicans set to oppose the bill when it comes up for final passage on Thursday. \n“I think there’s easily 35 no votes right now so unless something happens in the next 24 hours, I would predict they pull the bill and start over. I think if conservatives stick together, they will have earned a seat at the table where real negotiation to make this bill an acceptable bill will happen,” he said during an interview with Breitbart \nIn the House, all 193 Democrats are expected to oppose the bill. Without support from House Democrats, Republican leadership can not afford more than 21 defections, or else the bill would fail to reach the 216 votes necessary to constitute a majority. \nSuch a defeat, spearheaded by the same faction of the Republican caucus that forced his predecessor John Boehner to resign, would heavily damage Speaker Ryan’s control of the House. \n“You have to be careful when you go all-in with a full-court press that we are seeing from leadership,” said North Carolina Representative Mark Walker, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. “If you’re putting all your chips in the middle of the table and don’t win, it can come back to bite you.” \n“If his powers of persuasion come up short, it will be Mr. Ryan’s most high-profile stumble as speaker and a sign that the fractious House GOP conference is beyond his control,” reported the Wall Street Journal .
