Daly will also return as host for that season, which will begin in February 2017. \nCyrus is confirmed to be a coach on Season 13. At this time, no other coaches have been announced for that season, which will premiere in fall 2017. Related Miley Cyrus on ‘The Voice,’ Donald Trump and Coming Out \n“We can’t wait to experience the unique chemistry and energy Gwen, Alicia, Blake and Adam will bring to Season 12,” said Paul Telegdy, president of alternative and reality group, NBC Entertainment. “With Miley returning for Season 13, we’re truly ecstatic about the unmatched musical know-how and talent coming together in our coming seasons.” \nThe double renewal is a strong sign of support from NBC, though the pickup comes hardly as a surprise. “The Voice” ranks as the top alternative series on TV, and has won three Emmys, most recently for outstanding reality competition at this year’s award show. \nCyrus, one of Variety’s honorees for our bi-annual Power of Women issues, recently told us in an interview that she wasn’t sure if she’d do more seasons of “The Voice,” saying, “I don’t know. I definitely would like to if it made sense. I haven’t done the live shows yet. I want to see how that feels. They might be a lot more pressure.” \nWhile Cyrus is the only confirmed coach for Season 13, insiders insist that there is no reason to question the status of mainstays Levine and Shelton, at this point. Rather, the announcement was strategically made today because the network is excited to have Cyrus back on board for “The Voice” and wanted to get the word out, a source explains. The series regularly plays a game of rotating musical chairs at the coaches’ panel, which has also featured Christina Aguilera, CeeLo Green, Shakira, Pharrell Williams and Usher over the years. \n“The Voice” currently airs on Mondays and Tuesdays on NBC.
