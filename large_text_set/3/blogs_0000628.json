And your Halo skills are sexy too :)\" \nHe took a look at her YouTube account and the rest is history.

They couldn't fathom that people in Australia spent Christmas day at the beach in 40 degree heat! Leonie studied in Switzerland and the pair hiked and paraglided there (Photo: Leonie Sii) \n\"I experienced my first white Christmas in Sweden, went skiing for the first time and saw the Northern Lights which just blew my mind.\" \nIn 2015, Leonie had to move back to Sydney to finish her degree and Mattias returned to his studies too. \nBut after he graduated, he was able to apply for a working holiday visa and moved to Sydney to be with his girlfriend. \nNow, holding down a sponsored job as a filmmaker, Mattias is able to stay in Sydney for the forseeable future to be with Leonie.

Mattias and Leonie hang out in Norway (Photo: Leonie Sii) \n\"We bring out the best in each other. \n\"If we never pursued this relationship, I don't think we would have been able to have had all the opportunities that we've had and actually get to do things that we enjoy. It kind of pushed us to actually take action and do things, rather than just wait around for things to happen.\" \nYou can follow Leonie and Mattias' travels on LeonieSii.com .
