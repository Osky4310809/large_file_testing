Later in the game, he used the ESPN broadcast to give himself a second chance regarding his statement. \nMusburger brushed past the incident that got Mixon suspended last season, instead wishing him well with his second chance at playing fooball. Here are his initial comments: \nI rewound this to make sure I wasn't being too tough on Brent. Nope. It's even worse the second time. This is embarrassing. pic.twitter.com/QAoikxck9G \n— Mike Finger (@mikefinger) January 3, 2017 \n\nGraphic video of the violent incident was released last month , re-igniting criticism of Mixon and forcing him to issue another apology for the incident. Musburger’s broaching of the subject in the first quarter, however, was focused squarely on how he will do in the pros.\n\nMany took to Twitter to criticize the broadcaster for failing to mention the victim in Mixon’s violent incident, merely wishing the attacker well for his professional future. Here’s one such criticism:\nToo many under the impression that being somewhere between critical-to-objective of athletes accused of violence is unfair, which is whacked\n— No More Pizza in '17 (@TimBaffoe) January 3, 2017 \nDude broke a woman's face. That's fact. There's no \"yeah, but\" if you're going to bring that up.\n— No More Pizza in '17 (@TimBaffoe) January 3, 2017 \n\nEither Musburger checked Twitter or someone got in his ear, becuase he’s what he said later in the third quarter:\nApparently some people were very upset when I wished this young man well at the next level. Let me make something perfectly clear: what he did with that young lady was brutal, uncalled for—he’s apologized. He was tearful. He got a second chance.\nHe got a second chance. From Bob Stoops. I happen to pull for people with second chances. Let me make it absolutely clear: I hope he has a wonderful career and he teaches people with that brutal, violent video. OK?\nSecond down and nine.\nMusburger may feel like he’s being treated unfairly, but his comments on the broadcast are undoubtedly the largest public forum given to discussing the incredibly violent incident. Not only failing to expressing sympathy for the victim, but to all but ignore her in favor of Mixon’s professional aspirations, is gross and irresponsible.\n\nBetween those comments there was Mixon asking for the crowd to get louder at the half, presumably in response to Auburn fans chanting “he hits women.” \njamescrepea: Auburn fans chant \"he hits women\" at Joe Mixon at end of f… ESPN Sugar Bowl: A… https://t.co/MQctW8QLAr pic.twitter.com/eChxZaiiDa \n— FanSportsClips (@FanSportsClips) January 3, 2017 \n\nIt’s impossible to tell why Mixon is asking for more noise here, but either way it’s not a great look. Musburger himself frames the standout running back as “apologetic” and “tearful” about the incident that nearly derailed his football career. If he is truly both of those things, it’s best for him to greet criticism from an opposing fanbase with silence. \nIt’s good Musburger readdressed his comments again in the third quarter, but it doesn’t save him from becoming yet another broadcaster more concerned with the humanity of the athletes they cover than the people hurt by sports stars. \nWhat it is about young men being good at sports that makes adult men fall over themselves to make excuses for their behavior?\n— Julie DiCaro (@JulieDiCaro) January 3, 2017 \n\nSports are many things, but they are not a means of redemption for the personal and legal transgressions committed by those that play. The sooner we stop framing games as such, the better.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:05:44.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
