Burger King’s parent company, Restaurant Brands International, has finally announced that it will purchase Popeyes for $1.8 billion, thus creating a deep-fried, flame-grilled lovechild.\nRBI, which also owns Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons and currently has more than 20,000 stores worldwide, will soon add Popeyes’ 2,600 locations to its portfolio. The acquisition means big opportunities to spread the brand’s famed fried chicken and delicious biscuits around the world, as well as potential collaborations with Burger King (which is what we’re all hoping for, right?)\nHowever, the conglomerate still has catching up to do within the fast-food universe. Yum Brands — which has Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC under its umbrella — has more than 40,000 stores worldwide. Popeyes is relatively unknown outside of the U.S., and its potential for expansion is surely what caught RBI’s attention.\nThe deal is expected to close in early April. Stay tuned for whacky collabs if, or when, they arrive.\nIn other news, Mike Tyson’s 1995 Ferrari F50 can be yours for $2.4 million .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:34:29.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
