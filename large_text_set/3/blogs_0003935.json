For many of the dying, the health care workers at their facilities are the people they are close to in their final moments. Nurse aid Isabelle sang every Friday to Grandma Helen. Upon hearing that Grandma Helen was going to pass, Isabelle stopped by on her day off to see her and sing to her one last time. Said a family member, “We are all in awe of her voice and caring spirit.” Grandma Helen passed away within a couple of days of this video being recorded. \nThe family shared the video as way of thanks to the many compassionate health care workers who go unrecognized. They wrote, “This video is not monetized and we are not seeking licensing. The daily compassion of unknown numbers of good health care workers goes unnoticed by many. Thank you for the gifts you share and the love for patients you bestow.” \nThey added, “Thank you Isabelle for being a comforting voice in our family. Best wishes to you and the staff at Life Care in Seneca, KS. Rest in Peace Grandma Helen. We love you.” \nCompassionate people like Isabelle make the world a better place.
