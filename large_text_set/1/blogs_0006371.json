The original manga was first published in the Weekly Shonen Jump in 1999 and the original anime was first aired in Japan in 2002. \nIt tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young (and often immature) ninja who is constantly striving for recognition and has big dreams of becoming the Hokage, or the leading ninja in his village who is the strongest of all. Along the way, there are others who wish to prove themselves as the strongest, as well as other hostile ninja factions. \nThere are more than 50 characters in the Naruto Series, and each one has their own special power and skills. Some are stronger than others, but the strongest does not always win, and we see this time and time again with countless battles and fights between the ninja factions. But who is the most power of all the ninjas? \nWell we here at ComicBook.com ranked who we think are the top 5 most powerful characters in Naruto. \nWhat do you think about our list? Should someone else be on the top 5?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T06:45:32.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
