Many believe Sessions should resign, and should be prosecuted for perjury for lying under oath during his confirmation hearing. \nUSA Today reports: \n17 Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee asked FBI Director James Comey for a criminal investigation Thursday. The statements “could potentially implicate a number of criminal laws, including lying to Congress and perjury,” they said. \nFormer Speaker of the House and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi demanded his resignation in a press conference on Thursday. Pelosi declared : \nAfter lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the Attorney General must resign. \nPelosi is not alone demanding that Sessions resign. Thursday morning, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer also called on Sessions to resign. In addition, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is also calling on Sessions to resign. \nDuring his confirmation hearing, Sessions was asked if he believed a secular person has the same understanding of the truth as a religious individual. \nSessions replied : \nWell, I’m not sure. \nAt the same hearing, Sessions, a religious conservative, committed perjury by lying under oath about whether or not he had any contact with Russian officials during the campaign. \nBottom line: Sessions is a liar, a perjurer, and a religious hypocrite. In short, he is unfit for office, and he should resign.
