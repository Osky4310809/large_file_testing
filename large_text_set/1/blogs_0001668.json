Though Kelly's final show will be on Friday, Kelly used the closing of her Tuesday show to thank her colleagues, bosses and viewers.\n\"This was a tough decision for me because I love this show,\" Kelly said.\n\"Our staff, my crew, my colleagues here at Fox, and you — all of you. Those who write me the lovely handwritten notes asking about my kids, and even those who very rarely complain on Twitter about our coverage after a show or a presidential debate. Now I know I don’t actually know most of you so perhaps its not true love. But it makes one feel connected to another human being. And that, after all, is why I believe you are here — human connection.\"\nKelly went on to note that she \"needs more of that in my life,\" citing her three children as part of the reason why she has decided to leave the network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T06:59:22.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
