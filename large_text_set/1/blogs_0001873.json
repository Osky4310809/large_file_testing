His game is starting to come around, and obviously playing with the lead makes it a lot different, so good start today and I thought we played well. Even in the third period, it’s not necessarily about protecting the lead but playing smart with the lead, and I thought we did that.” \nHear more from Julien int he video above. \nThumbnail photo via Winslow Townson/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T01:54:47.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
