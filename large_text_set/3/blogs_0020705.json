These tips aren't necessarily expert approved by some sneaker dry cleaning studio in LA or anything , but they've been keeping my collection looking fresh as ever. Check out what I've got in my arsenal: First Line of Defense: Touch-Up \nTools: Mr. Clean Magic Eraser , Tide to Go Pen , Spot Shot , and a toothbrush \nFor simple touch-ups, one of these tools can do the trick. My first go-to always? Mr. Clean. With a little water, you can scrub both the rubber outsole as well as the fabric upper of your shoe, and it works on a variety of stains and marks on multiple materials. If I'm on the go and don't have Mr. Clean with me, I always have a Tide pen in my gym bag. And the last move I make before I move onto the soaking phase is some Spot Shot with a toothbrush — scrub, scrub, scrub.
