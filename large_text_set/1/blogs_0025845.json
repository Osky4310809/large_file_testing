If you don’t interpret an emotion correctly in the wild, it can be the end of you.” \nEvy van Berlo, an evolutionary psychologist, told local paper Tubantia that earlier tablet tests with bonobos – who, along with chimpanzees, are the closest living relatives to humans – had shown they demonstrated heightened interest in photos containing “positive stimuli”, such as other bonobos mating or grooming one another. \nThe scientists’ main problem has been building a touchscreen tough enough to withstand Samboja’s attentions, Van Berlo said. \nOne tablet, reinforced with a steel frame, was tested successfully for the first time two weeks ago on two older orangutans, she said, but did not survive long when Samboja – whose mother, Sandy, is affectionately known as Demolition Woman – got hold of it. \nOnce the scientists have a strong enough screen, Bionda told NOS, they will be looking to see if appearance alone is enough to create a spark of attraction between two animals. \n“This is completely digital, of course,” he said. “Usually, smell plays an important role too. But with the orangutans, it will be what you see is what you get.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:06:34.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
