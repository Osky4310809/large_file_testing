The neocon shill of a reporter from Buzzfeed, Rick Wilson, was catfished by some autist from the Hitler loving 4chan message boards and made to believe Trump enjoyed getting urinated on and all sorts of outlandish stuff. Truly, this is incredible. Let me post some screen shots. \nThat right there is the head of Buzzfeed explaining why he published a dodgy report of utter nonsense that was, apparently, fished around to other news agencies and summarily rejected -- because it's retard level was too high even for The NY Times. \nSince the 4chan ruse was revealed, Rick Wilson has been made out to be a top moron with a propeller helmet, laughed at and derided as a person of very low standing. The heat is, apparently, getting to him. \nWikileaks calls bullshit on the report. \nWhat sort of nonsense is in this top secret dossier? How about this? \nAnd now to the curious case of John McCain, war shill, neocon lover of death of agony. \nSource: Guardian \nSenator John McCain passed documents to the FBI director, James Comey, last month alleging secret contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow and that Russian intelligence had personally compromising material on the president-elect himself. The material, which has been seen by the Guardian, is a series of reports on Trump’s relationship with Moscow. They were drawn up by a former western counter-intelligence official, now working as a private consultant. BuzzFeed on Tuesday published the documents, which it said were “unverified and potentially unverifiable”. The Guardian has not been able to confirm the veracity of the documents’ contents, and the Trump team has consistently denied any hidden contacts with the Russian government. \nThe media ran with the 'explosive news' and will now get to enjoy its explosion -- as they hold it near their tiny little hearts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T15:50:07.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
