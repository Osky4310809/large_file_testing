With this fun DIY build, you can get that experience right from your own locker. \nThis build, from Instructables user Mistablik , uses an Arduino, coin acceptor, LCD screen, magnetic reed switch, arcade-style buttons, and several other parts to deliver sodas on command. Just insert a coin, pick a soda, push the corresponding button, and you have fresh can ready for your drinking pleasure. The build is fairly extensive, so we won’t get into it here, but if you’re looking for a fun Arduino project , you can find the complete instructions at the link below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:07:47.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
