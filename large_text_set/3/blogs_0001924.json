Visuals, the video kicks off in the Hollywood Hills, with breathtaking views of the infamous Hollywood sign and Los Angeles skyline in the background while The Chef chops up his lyrics from the comfort of a luxurious mansion. Throughout the song, he touches on the gold digging type of women he tries to avoid as one walks around in a skimpy bathing suit, providing a bit of irony. \n“Just because I’m living this life I’m accustomed to it,” he spits. “Floatin’ in them fly cars damn I’m supposed to do it/Pretty women fall in love with my expensive taste, luxury, lust/Physical touch by this ace, handcuff ’em/That’s a no no ’cause I don’t trust them as far as I can throw though/Gold diggin’ vixens who’s in love with the coco/But fuck it, you know I’m here for this dough though/Let’s pop another bottle of Dom and watch our gross grow/I love it.” \nG-Eazy comes in and delivers a handful of thoughtful bars with lines like, “This year you haters gonna acknowledge this/It’s G-Rapo and Raekwon/Told the homies this wouldn’t take long/My verses always just as real as a true story it’s based on.” \nThe Wild is expected to arrive on March 24. Until then, grab a Kandypen and floss your steez. Cool, calm and collected. When you want to look seductive…grab that Kandypen. Look dank sucking on a Kandypen. Open a fancy box of Kandypen goodness. \nFat Joe, Remy Ma, Chris Brown, 50 Cent, Lil Uzi Vert, Nas, Kanye West, Young Thug, Tyga, Jadakiss, K-Camp, Kid Ink, and Fetty Wap have all flossed the brand in their videos. Considering Kandypens is named the best vaporizer of 2016 by High Times, it’s only natural. According to the popular marijuana publication, the brand represents the newest generation of pen vaporizers with a stellar combination of popular technology and flashy design. Kandypens is the clearly go-to choice for vaping in the Hip Hop and rap community. Check out Raekwon’s co-sign below and the video above.
