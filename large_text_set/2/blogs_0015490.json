Sure, you’ve got your cardio queens, your yoginis, and your b-ball bros. But the gym is also home to people who manage to be incredibly specific and are still found in every gym around the world. Here are six of the weirdos you always see at the gym. 1. The naked old person in the locker room \n(source) \nEvery time you go in the locker room, someone over the age of 60 is in there with no clothes on, in absolutely no hurry to put any on. Why are they sitting on the bench without underwear? I don’t know, I haven’t asked. The locker room is their castle, and they rule in the nude. Are they daring you to look, or daring you not to? 2. The mansplainer \n(source) \nThe personal joys of fitness are not enough for some men. No, those men also need to tell other people how they should get fit, whether they like it or not. This is the guy who comes up to women he doesn’t know and gives them shitty advice on deadlifts. A while back, a guy came up to my girlfriend and me at the gym and told us that he admires how often we work out, but if we really want to cut fat we need to get in the sauna and sweat it all out. He continued this very untrue and slightly insulting advice for at least three minutes, while we responded with complete silence. The mansplainer will not be deterred. 3. The cardio machine hog \n(source) \nMost gyms have rules about how long you can use a machine while other people are waiting. All those gyms have people who think they are more important than everyone else, or for whom time works differently. 45 minutes for you is only 20 minutes for them, peasant! If you ask to use the machine, they will always give you a weird look like you’re the asshole, even though you most likely are not. 4. Guy who won’t stop running when the gym is closing \n(source) \nI like to go to the gym late at night, so I’m usually there at midnight when it closes. The employees give multiple announcements that the gym is closing, and I start getting ready to go at the 5 minute mark and make it out right at midnight. But there is ALWAYS a guy still running on the treadmill at midnight. Why? What’s he doing? Does he really need that extra 30 seconds of running before the employee comes and drags him off of the machine? GO HOME, TREADMILL GUY! 5. The people who don’t know how to exercise \n(source) \nThey don’t know how to use the machines, but that doesn’t stop them from sitting on them and flailing around. They get in the pool, and just kinda bob there. They seem to spend half the time sitting on the leg press, doing nothing but staring at their phone. They spend thirty minutes on the stretching mats in savasana. They could burn more calories going on a leisurely walk around their neighborhood but here they are, day after day, doing almost nothing at the gym. 6. The extremely fit person who doesn’t seem to exist outside of the gym \n(source) \nThere are some people who are at the gym every single time you go, no matter what time you go there. Their muscles are so big they don’t really look like a human being anymore. I’m honestly not sure how they stand upright. I’m pretty sure they hide in a locker while the employees close up and then keep working out all night, sleeping only in 10-second rest periods between sets. \nWhat kind of weirdos do you see at the gym?
