They used to be very cautious and structured as a counter-attacking side and now they've scored 76 goals in Ligue 1. Everybody is raving about Kylian Mbappe-Lottin but we'll see how he performs on the big stage. \nIt feels like there's more belief in the Manchester City camp though. The defence is obviously still not right but they did look like they had a bit of a stronger core against Bournemouth, although I still don't like Yaya Toure in the defensive-midfield role. Pep Guardiola faces the press ahead of his side's clash with Monaco \nI think if Pep Guardiola weighed things up he'd probably rather win the Champions League and I'm confident they'll go far. \nI think we'll get something else from Sergio Aguero because he knows he's got a good run back in the team if he plays well but Pep will drop him again if his level drops. Nicholas is expecting a good showing from Man City striker Sergio Aguero (C) \nI'm looking at City to win by a couple of goals and I'd back Kevin de Bruyne to break the deadlock because he's a big-game player. Agree with Charlie? Follow his Sky Bet tips here. \nSevilla v Leicester (Wednesday, 7.45pm) \nYou can see the annoyance and anger in Claudio Ranieri's face but is he changing things for the positive? Have they all stopped listening? There's so much going on at the club. Claudio Ranieri takes his Leicester side to Sevilla \nIf you look at what got them into this competition it was their spirit, togetherness and absolute hunger and I don't see much of that left in them. I keep mentioning the centre-backs as their big problem and I think he should try a back five. \nI don't really think Leicester have got much of a chance and people are suggesting it could be a thrashing but I think if they sit in with a packed defence and leave a bit of pace up top then they can limit the damage. \nCharlie predicts: 2-0 and Vitolo to score first (22/1 with Sky Bet) \nSt Etienne v Manchester United (Wednesday, 5pm) \nThe job is done with a 3-0 win at Old Trafford, even though they didn't play well that well in the first leg. \nI've been to St Etienne a few times as a fan and while they don't get huge numbers it's quite a hostile stadium to go into. Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates after scoring the 17th hat-trick of his career against St Etienne \nWith the cup final coming up at the weekend, Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be rested. I think Jose Mourino will still go with a strong backline though to ensure they've got a solid base. \nCharlie predicts: 1-0 and Hamouma to score first (45/1 with Sky Bet) \nTottenham v Gent (Thursday, 8.05pm) \nTottenham were dreadful last Thursday but they found a way to bounce back against Fulham, which I thought as a dangerous tie. Tottenham must overcome a one goal deficit against Gent \nWhen Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Heung-Min Son are getting on the ball early then you know they are going to cause problems, and that was the difference between the two teams. \nThey've got Stoke at home on Sunday so I think he'll give a few more fringe players a chance than in the FA Cup, but Gent are an average team and I wouldn't be surprised if Spurs won 3-0 even with a few changes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:17:27.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
