Her journey with Penn State THON began long before this diagnosis, however. As a freshman Kayla was a member of an OPPerations committee, and her junior year she raised $13,000 and won a spot to independently dance in THON. \n\"Life is tough, but I'm tougher,\" Kayla said in a 2014 interview with Valley Magazine. \nFor just a little over a year beginning in 2014, Kayla became the Blue Band's THON child. \nFor her career after Penn State, Kayla wanted to become a pediatric oncologist in efforts to change the world of medicine — today, in memory of Kayla, the Blue Band is trying to do just that. \n\"We grew close quickly. Kayla was very involved with us,\" Rachel Reiss (junior-French and francophone studies and corporate innovation and entrepreneurship), family relations chair for the Blue Band said. \"She loved the Blue Band and we loved her. When she passed it was like losing a member. Some of the younger members didn’t know Kayla personally, but they know about the legacy she left.\" \nAfter Kayla's passing, #TeamKayla shirts and signs could be seen throughout Penn State, from the sidelines of Beaver Stadium to inside the Bryce Jordan Center. Kayla's battle with cancer was supported by the university as well as the community. Team Kayla and Kayla Strong shirts were sold, and sold out, at businesses downtown. Purple flooded the streets in support of the late Nittany Lion. \nHannah Mattes, the Blue Band's canning chair, said Kayla's passing encouraged the band to work that much harder throughout the year. \n\"Since her passing we have continually worked to honor her legacy and support her family,\" Mattes (junior-biology) said. \"Losing a THON child was the hardest thing our organization has ever faced, and the loss of Kayla is something we will never forget.\" \nCostanzi said the Blue Band is well-known for their sense of family, and they want to share this with their THON families as well. \n\"Losing Kayla last year was like losing a member of this family. Even if a [Blue Band] member wasn't overly involved in THON, they knew that we lost an important part of our family,\" Costanzi said. \nThis year, five members of the Blue Band THON executive board will be dancing for the 46 hours. The increase in their organization’s allotted dancers motivated them to continue their fight. Last year, the Blue Band was represented by four dancers and represented by three the year before. \n\"We have become more determined to make a difference and more determined to raise money,\" Maria Costanzi, the Blue Band's overall THON chair, said. \"Last year, we proved our determination by being one of the top five general organizations for the first time ever.\" \nIn addition to the five members on the floor, more members of the Blue Band will be performing THON weekend during the pep rally along with the Silks and Majorettes. The Blue Band's main goal is to inspire through music. \n\"One of Blue Band's goals is to add energy to sporting events, and this is what we want to do for THON,\" Costanzi (junior-child and early adolescent education) said. \"We want to help give these kids even a little bit of energy to help them fight.\" \nMattes said the band hopes to inspire all Four Diamonds children to experience joy even when times are difficult, just as they do when making music together. +1 \nThe Blue Band poses with purple shirts in honor of Kayla Nakonechni Courtesy of Hannah Mattes \n“I think that the loss of our THON child reminded us all to live life to the fullest every single day and continue the fight against cancer for those who can’t,\" Mattes said. \nHeather Biasucci, a friend of Kayla’s and member of the Penn State class of 2015, told the Daily Collegian seeing Kayla’s positivity affecting the lives of thousands of people is the real victory. \n“Knowing that she will forever live on through everyone that knew her…that's winning. Not everyone has that effect on people. It takes someone very special to have that kind of impact. And that was [Kayla].”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:46:12.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
