Her website , filled with honest words about her struggle, inspired thousands. \nYet tragically Hannah died yesterday, after doctors decided this week to stop her chemotherapy. \n“Our brave beautiful Hannah lost her fight with cancer yesterday. She passed away peacefully at home with her family,” read a message on her Facebook page. Hannah Lyson \n“Hannah fought so hard to get well but it wasn't to be. We are all so proud of her and we will continue her work to raise awareness that you’re never too young. Thank you to everyone who has followed Hannah’s journey and supported her in her fight.” \nH ere, to honour Hannah, we’ve listed some of her most inspirational and relatable words for anyone with cancer: “Despite my illness I have in fact decided to go back to college to do Level 3 Aviation. I want to try and live my life normally and think about the future, and why should I put my life on hold? If I’m going to fight this horrible illness I may as well do other things to distract myself and also get a qualification that I can use when I get better to follow my dreams.” \"It’s time for my scans to see if my Chemotherapy is worked… Fingers crossed it’s all good news, I’m starting to get nervous now although I have faith that I’m in safe hands and I have all the love in the world around me so whatever the outcome, I know I’ll be okay.\" \"It is so scary and I’d be lying if I said “It’s okay though, I’m just getting on with it” because I’m not.\" \"I always think time is of the essence, and through my treatment so far I’ve wanted to jump into every opportunity to get better that they have gave me, despite the pain and despite how it’ll effect me. I’ll take anything and everything they throw at me to get better because pain is temporary but letting myself die from this would be forever. I’m not one to lose and I’m definitely fighting to win.\" \"I feel like I’ve took life for granted up to now and regret it so much, all I want to do now is literally love and live as desperately pathetic as that sounds. I physically just feel like curling into a ball and cuddle the ones I love and that is literally the only way I can describe my emotions.\" \"I wish I could say I didn’t have days like this and could feel strong all the time but after today, I felt a brutally honest post was needed to try and get the point across of what exactly me and others my age will be feeling. None of this crying and sulking is attention seeking, it’s a human reacting to their whole life changing and presented with the unknown and scary realisation that I have a seriously life-threatening illness out of nowhere.\" \"All I want is to wake up from the surgery. I think after being told I have this illness the big thing that circles my mind everyday, all day is: I don’t want to die. No one wants to die, but I feel like I’m closer to it than I’ve ever been, therefore panicking that for some reason I may not wake up from the anaesthetic… but I want to start attacking these little s**** as soon as I can, kick its ass. Anyway, for now, all I can do is wait. This whole thing is one big waiting game. I can’t do anything else but worry till then.\" \"There’s so many thoughts going through my head at the moment. I don’t know what they mean by palliative and end of life care, especially when I don’t see myself anywhere near end of life! I don’t feel it and I certainly don’t want to be anywhere near the end! I want to live to see next Christmas, I want to celebrate next Halloween, I want to make it to my 21st birthday let alone my 20th, I want to live for years and years beyond what they are so carelessly predicting, although I guess it’s just their job.\" \"I am determined though to prove [the doctors] wrong, I mean, how dare they give up on me and tell me there’s nothing else they can do? It’s obvious they’ve not met someone as strong as me.\" Follow The Telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T13:12:04.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
