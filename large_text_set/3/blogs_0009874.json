He’ll likely be the leading candidate to replace recently departed starting nose tackle Sylvester Williams, who signed a three-year deal with Tennessee on Friday. \nIt’s a family reunion as the Broncos now have two Pekos on their roster. Kyle Peko, a 2016 undrafted nose tackle who played in the season finale, is the younger cousin of Domata. 2 Peko's on the broncos  haha congrats @DomataPeko hope to Learn a lot from you! #GoBroncos \n— Kyle_TheCreator (@kyle_peko65) March 11, 2017 \nDomata Peko, 6-foot-3, 325 pounds, spent the first 11 seasons of his career in Cincinnati, 10 as a starter. During that time, he was one of their biggest vocal leaders and he’s also remarkably durable starting all 16 regular-season games in nine seasons. Oh yea Peko hella stout lol good pick up \n— Chris Harris (@ChrisHarrisJr) March 11, 2017 \nPeko struggled in 2016, as did most of the Bengals. Elway likely is hoping he gets a year or two of solid play out of a big nose tackle while likely drafting a replacement to groom behind him. \nKerr, 26, spent the first three years of his career with the Colts. The 6-2, 334-pound defensive tackle has eight starts over three seasons. He played nose tackle and defensive end in the Colts’ 3-4 scheme. He seemed to have more success when used as a penetrating player. \nHe could compete with Peko for the starting nose tackle job, but he’s likely to see reps at defensive end, where Denver also has a need. \nKerr had one of his best games of 2016 against the Broncos, notching a sack and two tackles for loss. \nBoth Peko and Kerr were added to improve the Broncos’ porous run defense. Denver gave up 130.3 rushing yards per game last season, dropping in the NFL rankings from third in 2015 to 28th in 2016. \nA big priority for Elway and coach Vance Joseph is to make sure they aren’t bullied anymore up front. The early signings of four strong offensive and defensive linemen make that clear.
