And neither does Dead Set on Life host Matty Matheson—those crazy sea bugs taste good all year long. \nWith eight and a half cups of cream, more than a pound of butter, brandy, wine, and maple syrup, this take on the classic East Coast soup is just as well-suited for the winter months. \nIt’s easy to make, but more rich and decadent than your go-to chicken noodle stuff (not that we have anything against the institution of chicken noodle soup).
