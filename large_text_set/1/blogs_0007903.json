Photograph: Yahya Arhab/EPA   09.02   \nO n 1 November 1911, during Italy’s campaign to capture Libya from the Ottomans, Giulio Gavotti, an Italian aviator, decided, apparently on his own initiative, to drop a bomb on Arab fighters at an oasis close to Tripoli. On 31 October 2011 , Nato ended its bombing campaign against Gaddafi by dropping bombs on the same oasis. Thus the French philosopher and historian Thomas Hippler neatly bookends his century-long story (nicely translated by David Fernbach) of the theory and practice of aerial warfare. Guns for hire in Hereford: inside England's unlikely global security hub Read more \nThe prescient HG Wells got there a couple of years before Gavotti. The War in the Air , his 1908 novel, foresaw destructive air power dominating a coming world war. When Blériot made his pioneering cross-channel flight from Calais to Dover, Wells wrote to the Daily Mail lamenting that the invulnerability of Britain as an island nation was lost. As a youngster besotted with Wells’s science fiction, I preferred his more utopian The Shape of Things to Come , which envisioned a world government policed by the air power of a benevolent dictatorship. Either way, Wells did better than most other futurologists, as Hippler’s history makes clear. \nAt the beginning of the first world war, planes were used for reconnaissance over enemy lines, but it wasn’t long before their potential as bombers was recognised. The response to bombers was the development of fighter planes, whose pilots rapidly achieved a romantic aura, their personal skills and bravery so different from the anonymous mud and slaughter of the trenches – think of the “Red Baron” Manfred von Richthofen. Futurists such as Marinetti embraced the fighter pilots as modern knights of the air, with their own codes of chivalry – an aura that continues even today to surround the Spitfire and Hurricane pilots as the Few who won the 1940 battle of Britain. \nThe reality for most was far from chivalrous, though. Between the two world wars, the leading colonial powers, notably Britain and France, used air power principally to suppress colonial insurgencies. In the 1920s the RAF, with the enthusiastic support of Churchill, bombed and gassed Kurdish rebels in Iraq, and the French bombed Damascus. In 1921 the British even bombed the Irish republicans. This was asymmetric warfare; the air warriors of the technologically advanced colonial forces were almost invulnerable to the weaponry available to the colonised. Imperial control, the military strategists argued in the 30s, could be achieved from the air without need for boots on the ground. Sound familiar? \nAir power soon came home from the colonised to the colonialists. It was above all the bombers that made 1939‑45 a people’s war, for Germany as for Britain. How to use the bombers most effectively was the subject of much debate among the tacticians on both sides. Military theorists argued that massive bombing campaigns could destroy the enemy’s infrastructure and demoralise the population. Hippler considers the role of Arthur “Bomber” Harris with his insistence on the destruction of German cities, but misses the political fight that led up to the decision on where to focus. The mathematical modellers who were developing the infant science of Operations Research argued that targeting railways and communication hubs was the most effective use of the bombers, but Harris had the ear of Churchill’s adviser Lord Cherwell and won the day. Saturation bombing of Cologne, Hamburg and then Dresden followed. And if 100-bomber raids didn’t achieve their goal, then a thousand bombers might. The resulting firestorms killed more than did the atom bomb at Hiroshima. But Harris was wrong: far from demoralising the population, mass bombing only strengthened solidarity. The OR specialists were wrong, too – bombing was so imprecise that only a small fraction came anywhere near their intended targets. Those of us old enough to recall the scattered bomb sites of postwar London can testify to that. \nBy transforming the nature of war, Hippler argues, using the terminology of Michel Foucault, air power made possible a new form of governance. Where once wars were fought between armies, sparing most non-combatants, now, with the bombers, everyone had become vulnerable. When the general population rather than just the troops are targeted, war changes from one between states to one between the peoples of those states. Across the century of air war, although the exact figures are hard to calculate and much disputed, the ratio of non-combatant civilians to military killed has dramatically shifted. Where once wars were fought between armies, now, with the bombers, everyone had become vulnerable \nFor many years after 1945, air power reverted to its earlier use in asymmetric warfare, above all in the US strategy of carpet bombing and defoliation of Vietnam. The 6,800kg “daisy cutter” bombs could flatten the forest within a radius of 1,700 metres. But only in 1982 were bombs once again dropped on a modern city – by the Israelis on Beirut. When I was there soon after, the vulnerability of steel-framed high-rise buildings to the new weaponry was obvious; the concrete floors collapsed, one on top of another, forming a multilayered sandwich. Such damage is now seen every day on our TV screens as Russian bombers target Aleppo and British-supplied Saudi planes pulverise Yemen. \nBombs have got smarter over the last decades, offering pilots sitting invulnerably, tens of thousand feet above the enemy, hitherto undreamed of precision in their targeting, as in the US’s “shock and awe” campaign in Iraq. But despite the confident predictions of the politicians, even the smartest air power alone has not proved sufficient. American, French, British and Russian boots are once more on the ground in the war-torn Middle East. \nThe newest manifestation of air power is the drone, the epitome of asymmetric war. Hippler describes Obama’s weekly White House meetings, known as “Bloody Thursday” at which the president personally approves the list of targets and people to kill in the following week – though it is the CIA that runs most of the US drones. There is no romantic role for the pilots in this profoundly alienated form of warfare, as they are comfortably seated thousands of miles away from the combat zone – although apparently they suffer from a high rate of stress and burn-out. \nThe drones have a twofold function: as well as their hunter-killer role in a global counter-insurgency campaign, they offer unparalleled powers of surveillance, a modern panopticon in which our every action is visible to the eyes in the sky: governance, literally from above. Wells’s shape of things to come has become our everyday life, though not quite in the form he envisioned. Rather than the benevolent dictatorship of a world government, our governance is in the hands of a far from benevolent global superpower and its allies among the world’s 1%. Hippler’s book tells an important part of the story of how we have arrived at this dystopia. \n• Governing from the Skies is published by Verso.
