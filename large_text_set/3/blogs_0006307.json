Maybe because the day is also being observed as \" A Day Without Women \" to show how vital women are in the workforce, economy and society.\nAs Samantha Bee pointed out in a tweet from her Full Frontal Twitter account, Trump has no problem with the women's strike because he is so feminist. Feminist to the point where every day he keeps women out of high-level meetings and decisions.

There are plenty of other examples of all-guys group shots in the White House. (To be fair, Trump does include women in other meetings, but you have to search for them . And we can't forget about Kellyanne Conway .)\nGreat meeting with CEOs of leading U.S. health insurance companies who provide great healthcare to the American people. pic.twitter.com/KlZJH6oJub\n— President Trump (@POTUS) February 27, 2017\nToday I met with pharmaceutical executives at the @WhiteHouse ... https://t.co/T1L7e8pHG1 pic.twitter.com/MDr9b7rBhN\n— President Trump (@POTUS) January 31, 2017\nIf you're wondering what patriarchy looks like: A group of white men watch as Trump reinstates the #GlobalGagRule pic.twitter.com/ZV1OX41ziF\n— Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) January 23, 2017\nTrump's predilection for groups of men doesn't exactly help support his International Women's Day tweets about his \"tremendous respect for women\"in the slightest, as duly noted by Bee and her show.\nWATCH: Someone has invented a waterproof toupee that looks just like real hair", "external_links": ["https://t.co/rYZeYo04kn", "https://twitter.com/FullFrontalSamB/status/839498460369936384", "https://t.co/KlZJH6oJub", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GlobalGagRule?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/832447477391491073", "https://t.co/MDr9b7rBhN", "https://t.co/ZV1OX41ziF", "https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/826505081101103104", "https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse", "https://twitter.com/JessicaValenti/status/823594304971173888", "https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/836261554135924736", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/8a2tDCq8.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/8a2tDCq8.jpg", "https://t.co/T1L7e8pHG1"], "published": "2017-03-09T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:02:22.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
