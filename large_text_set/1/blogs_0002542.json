Nobody has nothing bad to say about her.”\nPolice said Booker was crossing Nostrand Avenue near Kings Highway at the light at about 6:45 a.m. when a gray Toyota Sienna minivan struck her. The driver stayed at the scene, cops said.\nMoments later, the bus crashed into her. There were no children on the school bus, and the driver remained on scene, too, authorities said.\nBooker was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in Brooklyn but couldn’t be saved, officials said.\nPolice said detectives from the NYPD Collision Investigation Squad are on the case. There have been no arrests.\nHerman Booker said he was told by investigators that his daughter was crossing the street properly, at the light and that it was the SUV driver who didn’t obey the traffic signal.\n“That is not proper,” he said.\nPolice did not immediately confirm the dad’s account.\nThe dead teacher’s stepfather, Phillippe Antoine, lamented that she had her whole life ahead of her.\n“This was her first job,” he said.\n“She was always loving us, and we were always loving her,” he added.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:54:24.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
