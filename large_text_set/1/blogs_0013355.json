This thing is huge,” said Dave Anderson, who has lived in Grass Valley for 32 years.\nAnderson and his wife say they were floored at how quickly the sinkhole expanded over the past week.\n“I’ve never seen anything like that here or anywhere,” Anderson said.\nNeither have city and county officials.\n“This area used to be a large parking lot,” said Tim Kiser, Grass Valley’s Director of Public Works.\nIt’s the worst storm damage Kiser says he has seen in over a decade.\nKiser says the parking lot belongs to Liberty Motors. Employees were able to move the businesses’ inventory off the lot before it collapsed Wednesday.\nWhat could have caused the sinkhole to open?\n“We determined a seven-and-a-half foot culvert failed and created the sinkhole, which could have damaged thousands more yards of property,” Kiser added.\nCrews are now working overtime to stabilize the sinkhole before Wednesday’s storm hits.\n“Our ultimate solution is to put together a new pipe, but it will take several months,” said Kiser.\nThe sinkhole is estimated to cost the city about $2.5 million.\nNevada County officials say they are waiting for approval from Governor Jerry Brown’s office to get emergency funds and begin repairs.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T06:41:57.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
