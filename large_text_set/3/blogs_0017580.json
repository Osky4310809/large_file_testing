I’m thankful I’ve got a job again,” he said, according to Fox News . \nAn estimated 36,800 coal miners in the country lost their jobs after the Obama administration implemented strict regulations. Since Trump took office, 300 of them have been re-hired. While that may not seem like much, it’s a comeback that members of the community are willing to take as a good sign for the future.   \nNational Mining Association spokesman Luke Popovic said the move was important to revive communities like Hazard whose economies buckled under the collapse of the coal-mining industry. With fewer miners working, less money circulates, and that’s bad for virtually every business in town. \n“This is one very, very important step to get coal back on its feet and stop the hemorrhaging of jobs that we’ve seen,” he said, according to Fortune . \nIt’s good to see Trump undoing some of the damage Obama has done. Some of Obama’s messes will take longer to clean up than others, but it’s good to know that the president is following through on his word and working to bring jobs to communities that desperately need them. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about what Trump is doing.
