By: FE Online | Published: February 24, 2017 3:18 PM We are trying to bring her to phase whereby she is able to sleep without the help of any tablets. \nFrom Day 1, there had been buzz on social media about actor-director Lal’s involvement in the case. Reason? It is at his house that the actress had taken refuge and he had reportedly phoned Anto Joseph and thereafter informed police officials. The series of events reported by local media hinted at Lal’s role and the course of action that he had taken on behalf of the actress. Addressing media reporters, Lal said, “On that night when all this happened, she was heading to Remya Nambisan’s home. The Production Controller had sent the car only after the actress had asked for it.” \n“She went through so much that she was unable to sleep and the first day, I gave her a tablet. The next day she asked again because she couldn’t sleep but I refused. We are trying to bring her to phase whereby she is able to sleep without the help of any tablets. Now even if the doorbell rings she is frightened and all of us are trying to help her to overcome these fears,” Actor-Director Lal told reporters about the Malayalam actress who had been abducted. \n“It is unfortunate that the media has been reporting and sensationalizing this case by dragging incorrect names. When she came to my home, I decided to give her refuge when I saw her condition. I called Anto Joseph because even I didn’t know what we should do then. Now even Anto’s and my name are being dragged through the mud. I thought that people would understand my intentions in helping her but the media completely,” Lal told the media. When asked about Pulsar Sunil’s arrest, Lal told reporters, “It is the best thing that the police could have done. DGP Loknath Behera’s timely intervention has helped a lot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:22:09.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
