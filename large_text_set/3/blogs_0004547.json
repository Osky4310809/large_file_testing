But in the case that you do, it might as well be a good one. Here’s what you should look for if you’re in the market for one. Advertisement \nOver at The Sweethome , Doug Mahoney has some plunger recommendations he garnered from over 30 hours of plunger research. After talking to a professional plumber, taking a look at nearly 40 of the most popular models on the market, and testing eight of them on three lab toilets, here’s what he suggests you keep an eye out for: The most effective style is the “beehive” plunger (shown in the image above,) followed by the classic the “cup” style. Both of these styles are able to make a tighter seal against the bottom of a wide variety of toilet bowls, which allows the force of each plunge to do more with less splashing. “Flanged” or “tiered” models weren’t as efficient. Cup size is important for all plunger styles. The larger the cup size the more water it can hold and push with each push of the plunger. T-handle designs are more comfortable to plunge with than classic designs where the straight shaft can be harder to grip. \nNow you should be able to find a plunger that isn’t too crappy. If you’re looking for a good starting point, they recommend the Korky 99-4A Max Performance Plunger .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:16:14.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
