Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nThe long wait for Apple’s new BeatsX wireless earbuds is finally over and based on our first impressions, it was totally worth it. \nWe got our hands on a pair of the precious new BeatsX buds today and are mighty impressed by the big sound Apple managed to pack in such a small package. Like the AirPods, the BeatsX earbuds pack a custom W1 Bluetooth chip to pump out better performance and connectivity. Unboxing the tethered buds has been love at first sight. \nLet’s dive in! \nThe new earbuds went on sale today. There are four different color options — black, white, gray and blue — but the last two colors aren’t shipping for another 7 – 10 days. Beats put a Lightning connector on the buds for quick recharging. A quick five minute charge is supposed to deliver two hours of battery life. Total battery life is about 8 hours. You can pick up a pair online or from your local Apple store for $149.99 . The BeatsX tips attach magnetically.
