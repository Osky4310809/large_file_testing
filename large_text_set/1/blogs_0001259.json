Image copyright Polar Ocean Challenge/PA Image caption Part of the route, the Bellot Strait, would normally be filled with small icebergs \nSir David believes the disappearing ice and rising sea levels will have global environmental implications unless politicians act swiftly, and fears this could open the Arctic route to commercial vessels. \nThe explorer set off on the Polar Ocean Challenge aboard the 48ft (14.6m) yacht Northabout aiming to circumnavigate the Arctic via Siberia, Alaska and Greenland in a single season. \nPacked ice previously would have slowed progress on the 13,500 nautical mile trip. \nBut Sir David - from Box in Wiltshire - said after encountering little ice in the Laptev Sea north of Siberia, the yacht reached the Northwest Passage, where they found almost none for 1,800 miles (2,897km). \n\"I think we're all a bunch of ostriches, and what we're doing is handing it to the next generation to sort out,\" she said. \nHe compared the loss of ice to the cutting down of the Brazilian rainforests and said the Arctic had reached a \"tipping point\", which could lead to major flooding and famines. Image copyright Polar Ocean Challenge/PA Image caption The route to circumnavigate the Arctic took in Siberia, Alaska and Greenland \n\"It's an absolutely depressing thought. I know it's a well-used adage, but the Arctic is the canary in the mine,\" he said. \n\"What we're finding now is the ramifications of all this global warming, and it will definitely have an impact on us down in the south.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:09:41.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
