Major telecom brands are trying to put an end to Jio’s immense popularity by launching free data / voice calling plans left, right and centre. Just yesterday, Airtel launched one such plan in an attempt to stop mobile users from lining their loyalties with Reliance’s Jio. Therefore, we decided to take a closer look and explain everything there is to Airtel’s newest scheme. Who is it for? \nBefore you read any further, do note that only new users who switch to Airtel’s 4G network or users upgrading to a 4G handset can benefit from this new scheme. In other words, if you have never used Airtel’s mobile services and buy a new Airtel 4G SIM, you’ll be applicable for the plan’s benefits. Similarly, if you are already an Airtel 2G / 3G user and switch to a 4G-enabled smartphone, you will be able to get the plan’s benefits too. And if you’re on any other network and port your number over to Airtel 4G, the benefits would be available to you as well. Now that we have the basics out of the way, what exactly do you get with this ‘new plan’? Prepaid Plan \nEligible users with an Airtel prepaid 4G SIM can avail the plan’s benefits by recharging for Rs 345 which will give them 3GB of 4G data on top of the regular Rs 345 recharge benefits which include unlimited voice calls to any network and 1GB of data. Therefore, eligible users will get 4GB of total data (3GB + 1GB) along with unlimited local and STD voice calls. The first free 3GB of data can be availed using the MyAirtel app, however, the subsequent recharges will be instant. Prepaid users can avail the free 3GB data benefit for a maximum of 13 recharges. Postpaid Plans \nConsumers with an Airtel postpaid 4G account already get 3GB of 4G data on top of the regular plan benefits with MyPlan Infinity plans . The regular plan benefits of all the Infinity plans include unlimited local/STD voice calls, SMSes, bundled data as well as a free subscription to Wynk Music and Wynk Movies . Therefore, with the latest scheme, new users will be eligible for all of the aforementioned benefits plus an extra 3GB of 4G data. For instance, the Rs 549 Infinity Plan will give a user unlimited voice calls, 6GB of total data (3GB regular plan benefit + 3GB new scheme benefit) as well as a free subscription to Wynk apps. Users can take advantage of the free data with other Infinity Plans of Rs 799 and Rs 1,199 too. Postpaid users can avail the free data from the MyAirtel App. Validity \nThe free 3GB of 4G data will be valid for any recharge made by an eligible prepaid user for 28 days until December 31st 2017. It is worth noting that only those users who join Airtel’s 4G network or shift to a new 4G handset before February 28th will be eligible for this plan’s benefits. \nAirtel’s latest scheme will surely shoot up the company’s 4G base, but will it be enough to derail Reliance Jio’s momentum?
