(Reuters) \nSamsung has announced that it has partnered with the Karnataka government to improve the health sector in the state. Under the new tie-up agreement, Samsung will provide its infrastructure tools like Samsung Tab IRIS in a bid to manage the state’s public healthcare facilities. Samsung Tab IRIS is the first commercial tablet which has been approved by UIDAI for Aadhaar and KYC verification. It will enable Public Health Centers (PHC) in Karnataka to build their database in a digital format. Under the agreement Samsung Research and Development Institute, Bangalore (SRI-B) gave more than a thousand such devices to the Department of Health, Government of Karnataka. \nThis partnership is targeted at providing advanced technological support in the management of medical subsidies and operations at PHCs in the state more efficiently. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore and Health and Family Welfare Department, Government of Karnataka. The tool by Samsung can be used to scan the Iris of a person, and then can be linked to Aadhaar. This can be utilised by PHCs to generate various value added reports to facilitate decision making by the Health Department. Integrating technology with the help of Samsung Tab IRIS could centrally consolidate information regarding PHC administration such as patient treatment, diagnosis, deliveries and drug availability from various locations along with GPS information. \nYou may also like to watch: \nDr Aloknath De, chief technology officer, Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore, said, ” Samsung is extremely proud to partner with the state government for this digital transformation in the public healthcare space and is confident that the advanced technology of Samsung Tab IRIS will give a digital boost to the whole healthcare system. This will enable Public Health Centers to maintain and share medical databases on a real time basis.

(Source: Samsung) \nRamesh Kumar, Minister of Health and Family Welfare Department Government of Karnataka, said, “We are confident that Samsung’s world class technology will help us manage our public healthcare facilities more efficiently. Digitising the database is very important for our public health centres as it will lead to better planning and decision making at a state as well as central level.” \nThe database which will be created by the PHCs would help in providing information on the implementation of many welfare schemes like post-natal care kit for BPL/SC/ST women, Janani Suraksha Yojana, and others at their level. The information can be used by the Government to proactively intervene for improved health of citizens and target its welfare schemes more efficiently. \nDr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary Health and Family Welfare Department, Government of Karnataka, said, “We aim to connect with each and every resident of Karnataka at their door steps by upgrading the skills of our field staff and equip them with high tech Tabs. We are grateful to Samsung for associating their program with Karnataka. In the days to come, we will have Virtual Clinics with specialists on board connected to patients through these Tabs. The health records of patients would be analysed online to take effective steps towards prevention of diseases. Audio visual awareness will also be enhanced through the use of these Tabs.” Please Wait while comments are loading...
