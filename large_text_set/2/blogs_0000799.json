So, if you want a bold statement made with your outfit, metallic is the way to go. But what if want to make that statement during the day? Here is some advice on how to do just that without looking like a walking disco ball! 1. Sparkle in shoes. \nTaking baby steps should be your first and foremost guideline to do metallics when the sun is still shining. Go for a pair of dazzling shoes in gold or silver, while keeping the outfit simple and easy! 2. The dramatic skirt. \nThe last we checked, the metallic pleated skirt was reigning like a queen! But little did we know that these can worn just as much during the day as the night. The trick is to choose the skirt in a colour other than gold or silver and to style it with a classic white shirt, making it the perfect lunch-date outfit! 3. Top it off! \nA muted metallic top paired with a flowy skirt and flip flops can work wonders for the day! The top should preferably be in a day colour and if you feel it's a little OTT, finish the look with a blazer. 4. Bag the trend. \nMetallic bags are great style statements. A good bag with a metallic finish is quite easy to pull off in the daytime. Work it like these Hollywood ladies, keep the outfit casual and let the bag do the talking! 5. Cover up! \nTake cues from our favourite fashionistas Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid and flaunt a typical gold jacket or blazer during the day. A winter morning with gloomy skies is the perfect opportunity. See how they kept the rest of the outfit simple? That's the only rule you need to follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:47:01.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
