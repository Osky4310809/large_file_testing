Throughout time, men and women have ascended to the highest ranks by meticulously crafting themselves to appear to be someone they are not. We’ve seen this in corporate America with Enron and Lehman Brothers. We’ve see it with our email inbox, urging us to give to a Nigerian Prince. We’ve even seen it in fast food with that diddler Jared Fogle.\nNow, a professional fraudster has been outed for being fake footballer. Ricardo “Maserati Ric” Agnant has apparently been posing as a member of the Miami Dolphins for three years, bedding multiple women based solely on his likeness. Despite not playing a snap of football in college, he somehow made his way into the NFL Regional Combine at the Dolphins training facility. From there, he posted several photos that implied that he was on the squad, cleverly tinting and blurring pictures so that people couldn’t tell it wasn’t him.\nInstagram Screenshot\n\nInstagram Screenshot\n\nInstagram Screenshot\n\nInstagram Screenshot\n\nHe even fooled a car dealership into believing he was on the Dolphins, hence why they let him take a spin in their most expensive whips. He then photographed himself with them to give his followers the impression they were his.\nInstagram Screenshot\n\nAccording to Total Pro Sports , he was recently busted following inflammatory comments he made about black women–saying they weren’t “coachable”, were stubborn, argumentative and that’s why rich black athletes marry white women.\nRobert Littal of Black Sports Online then texted someone from the Miami Dolphins asking if Maserati Ric was actually on the team. “Who the Fuck is Maserati Rick??” the player replied.\nAfter news broke that Agnant was a first-class fraud, he deleted his Instagram account. He should probably get to updating his fraudulent LinkedIn, since he may have a bit of difficulty getting a job now.\nLinkedIn\n\nMoral of the story: Fake it till you make it.\n[h/t Black Sports Online ]\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:35:44.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
