Murugadoss are set to team up for the third time later this year. According to a source, this Tamil project ‘Vijay 62’ is likely to feature a leading Bollywood actress.”It’s true that Murugadoss and Vijay are coming together for the third time. The project, in all probability, will go on the floors towards the end of this year. Talks have been initiated with a few Bollywood heroines including Sonakshi Sinha ,” a source privy to the development told IANS. \n“Having already worked with Murugadoss twice in “Holiday: A Soldier Is Never off Duty” and “ Akira “, Sonakshi is the front-runner for the leading lady’s role. Murugadoss approached Sonakshi because both of them understand each other very well. Nothing has been confirmed yet,” the source said. \nAs per Deccan Chronicle, Sonakshi Sinha has already confirmed the news. She reportedly said, “I’m ready to star in Murugadoss sir’s next film as I have already worked with him in a couple of films. I have watched Vijay’s Thuppakki and Kaththi and feel he is a good actor. I won’t let an opportunity to pair opposite him get away.” The actress starred opposite Superstar Rajinikanth in Tamil film, Lingaa . \nThe film will be bankrolled by Lyca Productions, the company which produced Murugadoss’s earlier film “Kaththi” with Vijay. Vijay has just begun working on a yet-untitled Tamil project with director Atlee. Murugadoss, on the other hand, is busy wrapping up a yet-untitled Telugu-Tamil bilingual project with Mahesh Babu. \nAce cinematographer Santosh Sivan, who worked with Vijay and Murugadoss in Thuppakki, is also being said to be joining the team. Santhosh Sivan told DC, “Currently, I am shooting for ARM and Mahesh Babu’s bilingual film. Until anything is finalised, I won’t be able to say anything concrete.” Published: February 11, 2017 1:20 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:11:38.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
