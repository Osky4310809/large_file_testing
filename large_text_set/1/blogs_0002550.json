That’s the whole key about this shit. So I’mma do this song. It’s the last time I’m ever gonna do this song.” \nDrake then followed with a message for the crowd, telling them: “… When you win, please do it gracefully in 2017.” The crowd was then treated to what was apparently the final performance of “Back To Back” in history. \nAfter his lackluster effort in “Charged Up,” Drake was widely considered to have handed Meek Mill a pretty resounding L when he dropped “Back To Back” days later in the summer of 2015. \nThe song became a hit, peaking at #21 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and ultimately earning Drake a Grammy nomination for “Best Rap Performance” in 2015.
