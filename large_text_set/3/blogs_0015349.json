Blood is able to flow into the space between the layers and a blood clot forms, reducing the flow through the artery, leading in some cases to a potentially fatal heart attack.\nDr. Rahul Potluri, of Aston University, said: “SCAD is unusual because, unlike other heart attacks where the coronary arteries get plugged up over time with cholesterol deposits, it’s caused by a sudden tear where the coronary artery simply falls apart.”\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:41:52.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
