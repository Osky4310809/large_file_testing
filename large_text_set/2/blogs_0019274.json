Lennon's contract at Liverpool is due to expire in six months (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty Images) \nThe teenager's contract is set to expire at Liverpool in six months, when he will return to Merseyside from Real Salt Lake. \nBut his recent performances will certainly do no harm to his chances of an extension. poll loading Will Liverpool win the title with Klopp? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:40:53.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
