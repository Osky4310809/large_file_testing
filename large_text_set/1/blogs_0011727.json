While they are certainly fun to watch, many of them also leave us a bit puzzled. For instance, we recently stumbled across a blackhead removal hack by blogger Sherry Maldonado that left us at a crossroad. Two days ago, Maldonado posted an Instagram tutorial showing her solution to foundation appearing cakey on her nose. Let’s just say this blackhead removal technique is certainly one of a kind. In the tutorial, she uses an eyebrow razor to shave and exfoliate her nose. According to Maldonado, this hack of shaving her nose helps to remove blackheads, whiteheads, and dead skin. After a few scrapes down the bridge and sides of her nose, Maldonado shows the gunky residue on the razor and applies coconut oil on her nose. She then reapplies the foundation, and this time it appears way smoother, compared to the chalky appearance before shaving. As she states on her caption, Maldonado was inspired by dermaplaning. For those who aren’t familiar with the skin treatment, it involves using a sharp tool like a scalpel to scrape off the top layer of the skin. They usually include medical-grade tools for such a treatment, but can an eyebrow razor work just as well without harming the skin?
