It will last from 7 p.m. on Friday to 4 p.m. on Sunday, the exact same hours as THON, according to Bryan Moon, club cross country THON chair. \n“Members of the team will contact two donors to sponsor them while they run and then they’ll sign up for either a half hour or hour long timeslot throughout the 46 hours that we’re doing the relay,” Moon (sophomore-civil engineering) said. \nEach hour will have its own theme, Lizzy DeMarshall, club cross country family relations THON chair, said. It will eventually lead up to the club’s own version of THON’s “final four,” which will be run by their four dancers. \n“The team totals [about] 350 miles,” Moon said. “The whole time they’re getting sponsors. It’s just a big celebration. It’s a lot of fun.” \nAccording to DeMarshall the best way to donate to the cause is to go to the group’s Facebook page, called Miles for Smiles. There you can find more information on who the THON families are and a post on how to donate, which links to a Google form. \n“If you know a runner on the Club Cross Country team, you can choose to have your donation specifically sponsor them,” DeMarshall said. “But if not, the team appreciates any donation towards Miles for Smiles, that will ultimately benefit the THON children and families that fight every day.” +1 \nTHON chairs reveal the total for cross country's club Smile for Miles after the forty-six hours of running on Sunday, Jan. 31, 2016. Brianna Basile \nMoon said their goal for fundraising is raise more money than the previous two years. \n“Last year we raised $9,663.16,” Moon said. “This year we’re trying to just top that. A big milestone for us would probably be $10,000.” \nDeMarshall believes the fundraising total will definitely be substantially larger than it had been in the previous two years. She said this was because of increased efforts to reach out to different audiences like friends, families, high school coach and various teams. She also believes the total will be higher because of the amount of fundraising they are doing on social media \n“We expect for this year that, due to raised efforts to reach these audiences of increased interest, we will far surpass our total from last year, which is something we are very excited about,” DeMarshall said. \nMoon said the first time the fundraiser took place was two years because club members were looking for a new way to fundraise that would utilize their love of running.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T06:02:30.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
