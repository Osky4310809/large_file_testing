The black writing on dark blue makes it difficult to read, and that’s what elevates the shirt. You’ve got to respect the game here: This is a solid move.\nNot only does the shirt help send a message, but it’s a real life “zoom in on the pic” meme. That’s difficult to pull off. Unfortunately, there was only one step to this one — so we had to add some more.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:46:03.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
