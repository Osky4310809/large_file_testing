Every meeting, every call, every discussion, every idea has been out there, adjudicated, listened to and now it's time to vote,\" Spicer said. \nA vote has been scheduled for 3:30 p.m. after being delayed Thursday afternoon. Thirty-eight members plan to vote no on the bill, the White House can afford to have only 21 opposed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T21:18:26.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
