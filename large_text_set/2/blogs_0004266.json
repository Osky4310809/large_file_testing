Second, the explosive claim about the tape recorder being turned off by the US side is not based on any specific knowledge on Berman’s part. He’s completely guessing. As he later said on Twitter, it was “conjecture.” He also said he doesn’t “know for a fact that they turned it off.” On top of that, no one seems to be sure whether these calls are recorded or not. In response to a question about taping procedures, a White House spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that, “How these meetings are conducted is classified.”\nBut given Berman’s expertise in foreign affairs, and the fact that he works for a conservative-leaning think tank, his baseless claim quickly rocketed around liberal websites as evidence that Trump did something suspicious on his call with Putin.\nID: 10473261 3. Left-leaning website Raw Story was the first to write up Berman’s comment. Its story was headlined, “Foreign policy insider: ‘No readout of Trump-Putin call because White House turned off recording.’” It quickly spread on Facebook and Twitter.

Almost every one of those stories cited the claim from Berman as a fact.

A day later, conservative websites like Washington Examiner and Daily Caller stepped in to point out there was no evidence that a recorder was deliberately turned off (or that it would have been used anyway).

That same day, Feb. 3, Raw Story changed its headline to read “Foreign policy insider: ‘Curious’ that White House didn’t publish detailed readout of Trump-Putin call.” View this image ›\nTwitter / Via rawstory.com The site also appended a note to the story : “Note: This article has been updated to clarify that Ilan Berman has no evidence that the White House turned off recording equipment.”\nEric Dolan, the managing editor of Raw Story , told BuzzFeed News they made the changes after seeing Berman’s tweet about his comments on the panel.\n“The story was updated after we became aware that the source of the claim, Ilan Berman, had written on Twitter that his comments were an ‘aside’ and not intended to be a factual statement,” Dolan said. “A video recording of the event clearly shows him making the statement, but we felt it was necessary to update the story to point out that Berman apparently has no proof the White House did not record the Putin-Trump call.”\nID: 10473036 7. But by then the story was already going viral on Twitter. Geraldine DeRuiter, a travel writer, Quote: d a Raw Story tweet with the original headline and made a comparison to Obama. It’s generated over 70,000 retweets. View this image ›\n@everywhereist / Twitter / Via Twitter: @everywhereist DeRuiter said she has seen the updated headline and realizes that Berman’s comment was just speculation, but said she remains concerned.\n“Their failure to release more than a vague paragraph summary of an hour-long call, in light of these accusations, is alarming at best,” she told BuzzFeed News. “But my argument remains the same: if Obama had done anything remotely like this — an hour-long call with a Russian leader whom the FBI and CIA determined was trying to influence the election in his favor, and then not released a complete transcript — the GOP would be livid.”\nID: 10473034 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!\nCraig Silverman is Media Editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in Toronto.
