The system's star is an ultracool dwarf, TRAPPIST-1, which is nothing to write home about—but astronomers gradually realized that the system has a plethora of planets, and that three of them could support water oceans on their surface.\nGoogle, as it often does, commemorated the discovery with a Doodle:\nGoogle Google Doodles have been around nearly as long as the search engine itself, with the first one commemorating Burning Man back in 1998:\nThis Doodle appeared in August 1998. Google My own favorite is probably 2010's Pac-Man Doodle . Google turned the Doodle into a playable version of the early-80s arcade classic, even bringing Ms. Pac-Man along for a ride if you popped in another virtual quarter. The 2013 Winter Wonderland Doodle , which let users drive an 8-bit Zamboni to clean up after ice skaters and hockey players, is also up there. Some other animated Doodles:\nArmenian Google users saw this Doodle in 2015 to celebrate Mother;s Day. Google Another space Doodle, this one celebrating New Horizon's fly-by of Pluto. Google This Doodle commemorates the first electric traffic light, which appeared in 1914. Google Earth Day, 2015. Also from 2015, the 81st anniversary of a famous photograph purporting to show the Loch Ness Monster. Google Got a favorite Doodle?
