Officials from the Limca Book of Records were on site to validate the record, which will be included in the 2018 edition of the book. \nThe latest Nissan GT-R was launched in India back in December 2016, with Bollywood action star and Nissan brand ambassador John Abraham becoming the very first owner of the car in India. It retails for 19,900,000 rupees (RM1,297,190) in the republic. \nAside from aerodynamic and visual upgrade upgrades, the GT-R features an updated version of the VR38DETT 3.8 litre twin-turbo V6 , which now produces 565 hp and 633 Nm of torque (up by 15 hp and 3 Nm). It also gains a more rigid body structure, as well as an improved suspension setup that is not only better in the corners, but offers better refinement as well. \nGALLERY: 2017 Nissan GT-R The 2017 GT-R’s exterior receives a thorough makeover.
