I am still in this, and we are making it, but we are currently looking for a director. I remain extremely committed to this project, and look forward to bringing this to life for fans around the world.\nFor their part, Warner Bros. has said it “fully supports Ben Affleck’s decision and remains committed to working with him to bring a standalone Batman picture to life.”\nMore details to come.\n \nThe post Ben Affleck No Longer Directing Batman appeared first on /Film .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T03:56:47.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
