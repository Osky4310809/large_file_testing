It could have easily kicked that rat’s ass.”\nInflatable rats are typically used to protest the hiring of non-union workers, a practice approved by the National Labor Relations Board in 2011.\nBut Local 1’s picket line outside One Grand Central Place grew out of its long-simmering turf war with a rival organized-labor group, Local 339 of the United Service Workers, which was hired by MDB, sources said.\nLocal 1 protested in front of the building with the rat on Thursday, several neighborhood workers said.\nNeither the unions, MBD nor Empire State Realty — which also owns its namesake landmark skyscraper — returned requests for comment.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:30:39.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
