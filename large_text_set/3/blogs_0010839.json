Commonwealth champion, Sinivie Boltic was humiliated by an unknown wrestler from Delta State. \nThe championship which involves 30 weight classes in Greco Roman and Freestyle is aimed at selecting athletes for the national team as president of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation, Dr Daniel Igali said that any athlete who fails the championship may have lost his or her place in the build-up for the Commonwealth Games next year. \nAn elated Igali who spoke on the high standard on display added that Nigeria is sure of podium performances at the Commonwealth Games in Australia next year and the 2020 Olympic Games. He commended the young wrestlers for giving the old ones a run for their money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T04:10:06.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
