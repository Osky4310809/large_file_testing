But the frozen, wine-based drink wasn’t the only contender in Sydney’s cocktail wave. \nWhether you’re a traditionalist on the search for the best Old Fashioned or an experimentalist daring enough to try bacon bourbon mixed with blood orange jam, there’s a cocktail to wet everyone’s whistle. Here’s our pick of the 10 best cocktail bars. 1. THE LOBO PLANTATION — SYDNEY \nThis small CBD cocktail bar is drawing in crowds for its rum-based drinks, dressed up with a Caribbean flare. Our pick of tropical tipple is the ‘Mr Magoo’, a tribute to the 1950s cartoon. It’s a fun concoction of pineapple rum, Lillet Blanc, cacao and fresh lemon juice mixed with ginger beer. media_camera Bartender Jake Downs mixing a masterpiece at This Must be the Place. 2. THIS MUST BE THE PLACE — DARLINGHURST \nA Nordic-feel bar named after a Talking Heads track is just bound to be cool. Two of Australia’s top bartenders are reinvigorating the bar scene with their 19th century Imperial Shaker. The Gloss is a standout, made with fresh strawberries, citrus vodka, watermelon infused riesling and rosewater. It’s devilishly sweet yet fresh and restrained. media_camera Eau de Vie is an experience to be savoured, and not just for the drinks. 3. EAU DE VIE — DARLINGHURST \nThe Eau de Vie cocktail experience is like stepping onto the set of a Baz Luhrmann film. Torch blazed drinks and crystal glasses pluming with liquid nitrogen are just some of the theatrics that lure the debonair folks to this haunt. A must-try on the whisky-focused menu is the Smokey Rob Roy, a mix of whisky, cigar infused rum, vermouth and orange bitters, served under a cloud of wood smoke. media_camera Papa Gedes has a cool voodoo vibe and some seriously good cocktails. 4. PAPA GEDES — SYDNEY \nThis tongue-in-cheek tavern dedicates its entire menu to Papa Gede “A mischievous voodoo spirit and soulful guide.” The tiki cocktails are a bit kooky, but the real trailblazer is ‘The Zombie’; two rums, Cointreau, apricot, grapefruit and lime, mixed together and set on FIRE. media_camera Step back into the 1920s at the speakeasy-styled Palmer & Co. 5. PALMER & CO \nA 1920s Prohibition Cocktail Bar has a certain seductive air about it. The modern-day speakeasy will transport you back in time with dapper waiters and flapper-dressed waitresses. Listen to a live jazz band from Wednesday to Sunday night as you marvel in over 30 gins, 40 tequilas and 80 whiskies. We’re a sucker for the nostalgic ‘Moonlight & Love Song’, made with Altos Blanco tequila, Violette, Rosemary Wine, Lemon and Rose Salt. media_camera Earl’s Juke Joint is always jumping on a weekend/. Pictured is owner Pasan Wijesena. 6. EARL’S JUKE JOINT — NEWTOWN \nIts façade is a dank 1950s butcher shop, but walk inside this New Orleans inspired bar and you’ll be hit with the soulful beat of the Deep South. The cocktail menu is easy-going and focuses on quality. We take our hat off to the Phife Dawg, a refreshing mix of rum, lime, sugar cane and Angostura bitters. media_camera Grandma’s has just what you need after a tough week. media_camera The Barber Shop is an homage to the golden days of gin. 7. GRANDMA’S — CBD \nGrandma’s welcomes you to the only other place as kitsch and cosy as your own gran’s lounge. The long, creative cocktail list is matched only by the eclectic decor, with token-granny toffee apples and knitting yarn scattered around. While there are tropical drinks a plenty, we can’t help but indulge in the ‘Cold Trippn 2.0’, made with pamper especial rum, dark chocolate liquor and cold drip coffee served in a teacup, because it isn’t a visit to Grandma’s without a cup of tea. 8. PS40 \nYou won’t find any Diet Coke mixed drinks at Sydney’s first soda factory. The all-natural soda line is entirely homemade, with cocktail’s containing adventurous ingredients that mirror the food menu. For the daring, we suggest the superbly puntastic ‘Thyme to Turnip the Beet’ cocktail, with Beet infused Tanqueray gin, sherry, turnip puree, thyme and egg-white.
