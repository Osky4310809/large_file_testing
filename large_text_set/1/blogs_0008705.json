I became a part of that story as I drove a prototype 5 series (fun even in manual mode) onto a public Las Vegas highway, pressed a button on a steering wheel, and let the car’s test Co-Pilot system take control so I could focus on other tasks. \nLike filming the HUD on the windshield two-handed using our cameraman Clint’s Canon C100 from the driver’s seat; folding my arms behind my head and closing my eyes to relax and enjoy the ride; or turning completely around in the driver’s seat to face BMW’s Jay Patel and have a conversation about the various things I can do in the car thanks to his company’s Open Mobility Cloud now that I don’t have to pay attention to the road. \nTo back up a bit, before I ever got behind the wheel BMW took me through a demo of what the start of a day might look like once drivers and partners are using its Open Mobility Cloud throughout their lives. A prototype “smart window,” which is not intended to represent a product BMW intends to ship, but just a possible interface for the kind of driver data it wants to keep track of across its customer’s lives, let me arrange a schedule and set tasks. One example was to take a movie a child in the family was watching on Amazon and throw it to your car, letting them pick it up later where they left off at home. bmw-open-mobility-cloud", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:07:51.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
