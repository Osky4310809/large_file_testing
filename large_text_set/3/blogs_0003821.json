Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nN'Golo Kante has got Eden Hazard seeing double â€“ as the incredible Frenchman closes in on one of his own. \nHazard said the tireless midfielder was \"everywhere\" against West Ham to the point where it felt like he was playing alongside Kante twins. \nKante produced yet another lung-bursting, tigerish tackling-filled display in Chelsea's 2-1 win at West Ham. \nHazard and Diego Costa got the goals that fired Chelsea to a victory at the London Stadium that restored their 10-point lead. \nBut it was Kante, with his uncanny ability to read opponents' minds, who played a just as crucial role again and started the move that led to Hazard's vital opener with a trademark interception.

He is everywhere. I think sometimes when I am on the pitch I see him twice. \n\"One on the left and one on the right. I think I'm playing with twins. \n\"He is a fantastic player, he helps the team a lot and we are happy to have him on the team.\" \nBarring a spectacular Chelsea collapse, Kante will be seeing double at the end of the season too when he looks at his medal collection.
