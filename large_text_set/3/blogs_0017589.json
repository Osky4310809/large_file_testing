Photographers: Can we get a handshake? Merkel (to Trump): Do you want to have a handshake? Trump: *no response* \n— David Mack (@davidmackau) March 17, 2017 \nLook at that! She asks if he wants a handshake, and he 100% ignores her. America’s national embarrassment refuses to shake hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel https://t.co/87AQg2GFCV #TrumpMerkel #Resist pic.twitter.com/nC1Kazzkn2 \n— Khary Penebaker (@kharyp) March 17, 2017 \nA lot of people are having a hard time ignoring not just the disrespect, but the implied misogyny. Trump’s refusal to look Angela Merkel in the eye or to shake her hand belies his abject disrespect for all women. Today we are all Angela. pic.twitter.com/0vlXIBuSFP \n— Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 17, 2017 Trump’s body language with Merkel was weird because he doesn’t know how to interact with women without insulting or sexually assaulting them MERKEL: Pleasure to meet you, Mr. President TRUMP: Hi, you’re like a 3 \n— Michael MIA (@Home_Halfway) March 17, 2017 \nThat wasn’t the end of the awkward moments. After this meeting, the two gave a joint press conference. In addition to accidentally calling the country a “company”– Freudian slip? POTUS says “We’re a very powerful company” then corrects to “country” \n— Arwa Gunja (@Arwa_Gunja) March 17, 2017 \nAnd having this fantastic shade thrown at him: Merkel at WH press conference: “I’ve always said it’s much, much better to talk to one another, not about one another.” pic.twitter.com/C6Wmnbjsji \n— Caroline O. (@RVAwonk) March 17, 2017 \nTrump made a “joke” about his own completely baseless claims of wiretapping, in relation to the Obama administration’s actual surveillance of Merkel. Merkel’s reaction when Trump jokes about wiretapping is incredible \n— Marcel Dirsus (@marceldirsus) March 17, 2017 \nTHAT FACE. “As far as wiretapping by, i guess, this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps” pic.twitter.com/dv9MJwJ0d2 \n— Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) March 17, 2017 \nYou can hear the press laughing awkwardly, and they’re definitely laughing at him. hey everyone i just went to the good timeline for a photo of angela merkel’s visit to the white house pic.twitter.com/IEXSPqA2iu \n— Oliver Willis (@owillis) March 17, 2017 \nYou guys, I don’t think Trump is having the best day. \n(featured image via screengrab) \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
