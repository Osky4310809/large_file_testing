After Dipika Kakar , who played the titular role of Simar quit, it is lead actor Dheeraj Dhoopar who has put in his papers. We guess that like Dipika, it is monotony that has exhausted Dheeraj as well. The actor will shoot his last on March 8. Sasural Simar Ka has been a landmark show in Dheeraj’s career and made him a household. He came in as a replacement for Shoaib Ibrahim who left the serial in 2013. The actor has seen the show through its successful supernatural phase and was playing father to two married daughters. He is just 32 in real life.

He is now serving notice period. In a statement to The Times of India, Dheeraj said, “I am parting on a good note. I have quit the show for better opportunities and want to take up a romantic show next. If a project materialises, I could be back on screen within no time. Otherwise, I would like to work on my body and return in a new avatar.” The actor got married in November to long-time girlfriend Vinny Arora.
