ASUS ZenFone 4 flagship spotted on GFXBench, 5.7-inch display and Snapdragon 820 in tow By February 7, 2017 “ASUS is expected to unveil its next flagship ZenFone smartphone soon” \nAt CES in January, ASUS introduced the camera-centric ZenFone 3 Zoom and Google Tango AR-enabled ZenFone AR flagships. Now it appears that the brand is all set to introduce a new flagship. Ahead of the unveiling, the upcoming ASUS ZenFone 4 has been spotted on GFXBench , which has revealed a couple of its specs. \nAs per GFXBench, the ASUS ZenFone 4 will feature a 5.7-inch quad-HD display, and will boot Android Nougat out of the box. It will utilise a 2.1GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, mated to a beefy 6GB of RAM. The device will offer 64GB of internal memory, a 21MP primary shooter with 4K recording and an 8MP rear snapper. Other information about the phone including battery capacity is not available at the moment. \nIt’s worth mentioning that ASUS had already launched the ZenFone 4 back in May 2014, but it was a 4-inch entry-level offering. So the brand could launch its next flagship as the ZenFone 4 as the successors to the ZenFone 3 series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:00:33.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
