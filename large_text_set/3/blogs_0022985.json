The 20-year-old was heavily linked with several teams in January already, including Chelsea and Manchester United and Juventus and just about every other big team out there, and his agent is certainly expecting to be a busy man this summer. “There are at least 20 clubs following the lad, including the best in Europe.” At least! Napoli are just the latest name to be thrown into the hat apparently, but whoever wins the the honor of Kessie’s signature in the end, will have to pay up a fair amount. “Aurelio De Laurentiis?
