So why would his detention raise the eyebrows, and elevate the blood pressure, of the Indian football fraternity? Well, it's because of his evident connections to Goan football. \nLemos is the owner of FC Bardez, a Goa Professional League (GPL) side that participate in the Konkan state's regional football championship. It was earlier this year that the Bardezkars earned direct promotion to the GPL, after paying a sum of INR 10 Lakhs to the Goa Football Association (GFA), after a successful bid was enlisted. \nHowever, the Goan's investment trail in Indian football doesn't end there. In October 2015, Lemos' Australian-based but Dubai headquartered company, FC Prime Markets, of whom he is Chairman, were enlisted as one of the principal sponsors of the Indian Super League (ISL) side FC Goa. They'd signed a FIVE year sponsorship deal, with Exential group being the parent company. However, the deal was terminated when Jaydev Mody took charge of the club. This is the second occasion, ISL's FC Goa have been involved with a company suspect of cheating and money laundering after the earlier case of QNET . \nIt must be noted that Bardez had bid for a direct berth into the I-League but their proposal was rejected by the All India Football Federation (AIFF). \nThe patron-in-chief of FC Bardez was arrested in the City of Gold on account of 'failed return' complaints filed by multiple investors of his company's schemes, wherein a return of 100 per cent was promised on investments upto United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED) 91,800, which converts to INR 17 Lakhs, a per exchange rates today, 3rd January, 2017. \nInvestigators from the United Kingdom working with Dubai's authorities alleged that Lemos ran a ponzi investment scheme surpassing more than AED 50 MILLION (INR 92 CRORE) and have now slapped criminal charges on him. \n\"We are working with various authorities both inside and outside Dubai, and looking at the alleged laundering of more than Dh50m by one individual. We have raised the question of how he could legally set up and run another investment fund when he was apparently never licensed to do this in the first place, is under investigation for illegal trading by the Department of Economic Development (DED) and has judgments against him from the civil courts. \n\"He has now been arrested on criminal allegations,\" revealed a spokesperson of Carlton Huxley, the UK fraud investigation specialists, to Middle Eastern newspapers. \nWhat is important to note here is that Exential claimed that the inability of it to return money back to its investors was specifically because its operations in Australia, under the FC Prime Markets banner, was under the cynosure of Australian anti-money laundering compliance investigators. \nLemos downfall came after he circulated an email to potential highlighting a new \"advisory services\" investment scheme under the moniker of the Exential group. It's also frightening to understand that Lemos' firm had in fact been ordered to cease its forex trading operations in July 2016 by the DED in Dubai, after complaints by Investors.
