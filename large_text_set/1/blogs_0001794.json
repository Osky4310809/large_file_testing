Walter Sabatini, has been a busy, busy man so far. Having arranged the sale of Iago Falque and the loan of Juan Iturbe already this winter, he’s now turned his attentions to finding a short-term replacement for Mohamed Salah, who’s joined up with the Egypt squad for the Africa Cup of Nations for the next month or so. According to Sky Sports Italia , Massara’s personal shopping list is three names long and he’s in London negotiating to take at least one of them back to Rome with him. In addition to the Everton’s Gerard Deulofeu and West Ham’s Sofiane Feghouli, the name that concerns us most is Chelsea youngster Charly Musonda, who’s been recalled from his loan at Real Betis and has been training with the first-team for a couple weeks now. We’ve heard of a possible Musonda loan to Rome before, so that bit isn’t surprising — it was his father, in fact, who posed the binary outcome of Charly Jr either staying with Chelsea for the rest of the season or going to Roma on loan. Since then, Conte has opted against playing Musonda in Sunday’s FA Cup match to keep the loan option open and on the table, so perhaps this will indeed be the outcome.
