By Danielle Zickl Tuesday, March 7, 2017, 2:54 am Ryan Hulvat \nMore than a thousand runners in two different places experienced a race-day disappointment last weekend: Officials directing the Woodlands Marathon in Woodlands, Texas, and the Marathon of the Treasure Coast (and its accompanying half) in Stuart, Florida, made errors that caused the courses to be short for some or all of the runners. \nAfter the Woodlands Marathon on March 4, race organizers discovered that the lead motorcycle misdirected the lead cyclist to skip the second turn. As a result, the USATF-certified course was shortened by 0.8 miles.

A press release issued on March 5 stated that Race Director Willie Fowlkes has contacted the Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) to see if times can be adjusted and submitted for qualification. \n“We are extremely disappointed in this outcome,” Fowlkes said. “We will do everything in our power to assist those trying to submit qualifying times to the Boston Athletic Association for the 2018 event.” A post shared by Marcus (@irondad) on Mar 4, 2017 at 10:28am PST \nThe next day, during the Marathon of the Treasure Coast on the eastern shore of Florida, a police officer directed a pacer off course, causing 51 out of 177 marathoners (and 108 out of 624 half-marathoners) to skip a 0.8-mile portion of the race through downtown Stuart. A post shared by Colleen Lerro Gallagher (@heartandsole_colleen) on Mar 5, 2017 at 9:23am PST \nThe race management team released a statement on March 6, taking full responsibility for the mishap and promising to make improvements at next year’s race. But according to the TC Palm , Race Director Jeanne Brower said participants should have known the course better beforehand to avoid any misdirection.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:19:33.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
