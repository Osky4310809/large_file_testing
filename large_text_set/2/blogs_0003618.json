Although provision had been made in the Official Language Act 1963 for the continued use of English in addition to Hindi, it is expected that Hindi will be used for all official purposes of the Union after January 26 of 1965.“ The news published in a circular issued by the Lal Bahadur Sastri-led Union government in 1964 had enough fuel to trigger the famous anti-Hindi agitation of 1965, an event which not only united Tamils against one cause but also changed the dynamics of politics in Tamil Nadu by bringing Dravidian parties to the forefront. \nThe pattern of the recent protests against the jallikattu ban may have looked like a reprise of the anti-Hindi protests, with both uprisings being spearheaded by students. But, the strings that pulled both were different and so were the repercussions. \nUnlike the jallikattu protest wherein students declined involvement of any political party in the agitation, it was the DMK which laid the foundation for the anti-Hindi protests in 1965. The DMK executive council under general secretary Navalar Era Nedunchezhian on January 8, 1965 declared that the party would celebrate that year’s Republic Day as ‘Mourning Day’ in protest against the Union government’s decision of having chosen the day for the imposition of Hindi in the south. \nWithin six hours of this decision, student leaders met at Pachaiyappa’s College to take the movement forward.This was followed by massive protests by students across the state. Students were afraid that they will not be eligible for Central government jobs if Hindi became the sole official language. The Tamil Nadu Students Anti-Hindi Agitation Council coordinated the anti-Hindi protests. Picketing and protests were seen on the campus of Presidency College, Annamalai University (Chidambaram), The American College (Madurai) and Raja Serfoji College (Thanjavur) among others. An indefinite suspension of the Part XVII of the constitution was demanded at the Tamil Nadu Anti-Hindi Conference, held in Trichy on January 17. \nAs a preventive step, Annadurai was arrested and taken into police custody on January 25. The following day saw more than 50,000 students carrying out a rally from Napier Park to the secretariat to petition the chief minister. \nDMK cadres like Keezhapavoor Chinnasamy and Aranganathan immolated themselves. M Karunanidhi was sent to solitary imprisonment in Palayam Kottai. \nInterestingly , while the fear of loss of job opportunities was the only reason that united students against the imposition of Hindi in TN, the cause that united students on Marina wasn’t jallikattu alone. Jallikattu served as a symbol for students to pour out their pent-up ire against the establishment on a range of issues including the Cauvery water, demonetization and drought in TN. \nWhile the anti-Hindi agitations started on a peaceful note, police firing saw the usually peace-loving Tamils retaliating through violent acts. The uprising led to the fall of the Congress regime in 1967 and pushed DMK to the forefront. The jallikattu protest on the contrary was a highly peaceful agitation which gave students a platform to ex press themselves. That they desired no medium to put forth their demands became evident when they turned down any support from political parties or celebrities. It, however, took an ugly turn, when lumpen elements marred it with violent acts. \nLooking back, I think, in the aftermath of the anti-Hindi protests, the government patted itself on the back just by putting neon lights proclaiming ‘long live Tamil’ in government buildings rather than making Tamil a medium of instruction in schools and colleges. Such hollow assurances sans solid steps continue till date.The real development of Tamil culture is on the back-burner. \nThe anti-Hindi agitation gave birth to many young leaders like K Kalimuthu, P Seenivasan, L Ganesan, A Ravichandran, Durai Murugan, Sedapatti Muthaiah, M Natarajan (Sasikala’s husband) etc. While many of them went on to become ministers and MPs, some faded into oblivion. Fired by a larger cause, a few made their mark in other fields. Will we see any of the jallikattu protesters reaching great heights? The answer to that would depend on the impact the agitation had on Tamil people’s ideas.   The author was a student leader during the anti-Hindi agitation in 1965.
