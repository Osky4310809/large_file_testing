It’s easy to believe that you are better or more powerful or more worthy than everyone else because in many ways, you are. Mark Cuban is worth an estimated $3.5 billion and his seamless crossover into pop culture has made him a double-headed monster. He’s proven time and time again to be a spiteful dude, citing his incessant pissing contests with Donald Trump.\nBut this is a whole other level of using power and status to intimidate and threaten. And it’s petty as fuck.\nLast night, Bleacher report posted a tweet of Dirk Nowitzki air balling a three-pointer, accompanied with the caption, “Dirk Forever.” Here is a screenshot of the tweet, which has since been deleted (we’ll get to that).\nTwitter\n\nA video of the airball:\n\nMavericks owner Mark Cuban caught wind of the tweet and, likely a bit frustrated that his team is in the basement of the Western Conference, sent an aggressive email to David Levy, President of Bleacher Report’s parent company, Turner.\nTwitter\n\nSidenote: If you sign your name with just the first letter, you’re probably a douchebag.\nLevy responded to Cuban like a customer service representative whose email is being monitored for quality assurance. Cuban’s anger could not be fanned.\nTwitter\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the power of a billionaire:\nEarlier today we deleted a tweet about Dirk Nowitzki. Dirk is an NBA legend in our eyes and will be forever.\n— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 25, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:05:03.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
