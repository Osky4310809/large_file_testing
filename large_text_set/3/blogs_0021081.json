Insider Reveals Trump’s Transition Team Was Under Surveillance After Election Day \n“The bots’ end products were largely millions of Twitter and Facebook posts carrying links to stories on conservative internet sites such as Breitbart News and InfoWars, as well as on the Kremlin-backed RT News and Sputnik News,” sources told McClatchy. \n“This may be one of the most highly impactful information operations in the history of intelligence,” one former U.S. intelligence official stated on a condition of anonymity. \nFederal investigators are seeking to discover if Breitbart and other sites cooperated in the efforts.   \nAccording to Alexa , Breitbart’s web traffic shot up dramatically in October, in relation to other similar websites, and has remained at a high level since. It currently is in the top 100 most viewed websites in the country, even outpacing FoxNews.com. \nBreitbart reported on Nov. 19 that it experienced a record 300 million page views over the previous 31 days. \nThe news site did not respond for comment about the McClatchy story. \nBreitbart’s former chairman, Steve Bannon, stepped down to become the CEO of the Trump campaign in August. He now serves as a top adviser on the president’s White House staff.   Gowdy Names 6 Obama Officials As Possible Flynn Unmaskers \nInfoWars’ Alex Jones responded to the story on his radio program on Monday. \n“To be called a Russian asset by McClatchy and by the LA Times and by a bunch of other publications today is funny, if it wasn’t so serious,” he said. \n“I don’t personally take this as a threat … I’m threatened for the country. I mean if the Russians want to secure our borders, cut our taxes, not have us go bankrupt, rebuild our military, block radical Islam — well then, hell, I’m a Russian agent! But I’m not,” Jones added, according to The Daily Caller . \nAs reported by Western Journalism , FBI Director James Comey confirmed on Monday in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that his agency is investigating “alleged links” between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. \nEarlier this month, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated on Meet the Press there was “no evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. \nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., voiced the same conclusion on Fox News Sunday .
