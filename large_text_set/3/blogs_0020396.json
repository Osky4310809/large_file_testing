Screenshots They broke more things than they fixed. by KonnMan The latest update of the app will now open RDP sessions way off center on the screen, you then have to drag the session back up so you can use it.More generally, somehow they still can’t get a multi tabbed interface on this like most other RDP solutions. And like other reviews mentioned, you still can’t put connections in folders.Also, integration with Windows 10 DPI settings is non-existent. Windows 10 leaves the DPI choice up to the connecting client settings, which only seems to work from a windows 10 client. So of course, from the Mac they leave it as default, with no ability to change it. The result is a super tiny user experience if using higher resolutions. The only workaround is to use lower resolutions, which makes things look crappy, or keep using windows 7 for your hosts.Update… 8.0.38 and still many bugs. A little buggy and ugly by jds2726 Had my fair share of connection issues when using this with Server 2007 but problems fixed themselves when I switched to server 2012. Seems to be working okay now though. The icon is also pretty horrible. I know this doesnt impact functionaluty but I really appreciate a decent Icon since I have to see this on my dock all the time. Lost all my configs by scottricketts All of my remote sessions are gone, this is going to take me ages to get back.
