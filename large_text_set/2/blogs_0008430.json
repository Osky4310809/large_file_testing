Shaking my head, but nice try kid. atwatercrushesokoye says: Feb 10, 2017 6:09 PM \nI’m sure this will end well… Feb 10, 2017 6:11 PM \nUnprofessional. Feb 10, 2017 6:12 PM \nHow does this sit with Cleveland? Jeez. \nAs a draftee you don’t pick. You play your ass off for the next mega contract bordner says: Feb 10, 2017 6:13 PM \nPlease, Cleveland. Whether he was on your board or not… please draft him!!! Feb 10, 2017 6:13 PM \nGood for him…why not make a plea to play for your favorite team. dawgturd says: Feb 10, 2017 6:14 PM \nWow, never thought he’d go this route. No divas for me. Maybe every team should not select him that way he falls to dallas’s pick. Wonder how he’d like that pay cut. rodgerstonelson says: Feb 10, 2017 6:14 PM \nWow, talk about smacking Romo in the face. Trade up to get him….lol…has he been drug tested yet? flipola says: Feb 10, 2017 6:16 PM \nI hate the Cowboys, but I like the fact that he’d do this. You can tell he really wants to play for his team, and I’m sure he’d be happy wherever he went. It’s a pretty out there request.. I appreciate his honesty. dickshotdogs says: Feb 10, 2017 6:16 PM \nI’ve listened to this guy speak on several occasions. He is immensely talented. He is also a complete narcissist. He only cares about himself. Nothing about this man indicates he cares about the team. He’s a me guy all day long. Draft him at your peril. Feb 10, 2017 6:16 PM \nHe called Jerry ‘Jerry’, but referred to the coach as “Mr.”. \nHe’s screwed Feb 10, 2017 6:16 PM \nDumb as the day is long, and not as talented as Derek Barnett. Feb 10, 2017 6:17 PM \nReminds me of the time Manziel texted the Browns to pick him – and they did! \nThe rest, as they say, is history. Feb 10, 2017 6:17 PM \nOne or two counts of assault and battery should make it happen. bmack1224 says: Feb 10, 2017 6:19 PM \nYour best chance of playen in Dallas is Getting Arrested for D U I or Possesion. Only then will your draft stock drop. charliecharger says: Feb 10, 2017 6:21 PM \nThe Cowboys might take the advice and trade up. But they’ll select Jonathan Allen instead. jag1959 says: Feb 10, 2017 6:23 PM \nGood luck with that kid. Classy asking for Romo to be jettisoned btw traevin says: Feb 10, 2017 6:23 PM \nDon’t know much about the guy, as I don’t follow college ball, but it would be hard to deny that he has impeccable taste in football teams, am I right? casualmalexlfan says: Feb 10, 2017 6:23 PM \nJust don’t tell em you wanna “wreck this league”. Feb 10, 2017 6:28 PM \nAttention Cleveland: \nIn 2012 for RGIII The Redskins traded from the 6th over all pick to the 2nd and it took two additional first round and another second round pick. Dallas is currently picking 28th over all….. \nThe trade should make Jerry Jones cry on the phone while placing the call to the Commissioner and immediately place Jason Garrett on the Super Bowl or Bust hot seat. BIGGSHAUN says: Feb 10, 2017 6:29 PM \nGoing to Cleveland, where your season is assured of ending in disappointment, or going to Dallas, where your season is assured of ending in disappointment. \nHmmm. Tough choice. redlikethepig says: Feb 10, 2017 6:30 PM \nHe was OK until he mentioned Romo. Then he turned into a spoiled, little diva. Which makes him perfect for the Cowboys. But I seriously hope something like this happens to him when his career starts to fade. Karma … it’s a … something. ravenmadnky says: Feb 10, 2017 6:32 PM \nYeah, if I’m Cleveland, I’m giving up the #1 pick for an old, broken-down, overpriced Romo and some ham sandwich draft picks. Uh huh. Sure. titansfan12 says: Feb 10, 2017 6:38 PM \nOk, trade Dak and Zeke Mr. Jones and you can have him. That’s what I’d tell Dallas. Doesn’t look like it’ll happen. What a stupid video rhett16 says: Feb 10, 2017 6:39 PM \nCleveland should immediately ask for Romo, Jaylon Smith and Dallas’ first 2 picks this year and a 1 next year. When Dallas says no, Cleveland should post a video telling Myles, “We offered you to Dallas, but they don’t want you. Welcome to Cleveland.” coop16 says: Feb 10, 2017 6:42 PM \nMost mock drafts show the Browns taking this guy with the #1 pick, but since it’s clear that he doesn’t want to play for them, they should look elsewhere. No point wasting the top pick on a kid who doesn’t want to play for you and will probably just pout for a few years until he can gain free agency and hurry off to Dallas. \nGranted, I doubt that very many players really WANT to play for that mismanaged dumpster fire of a franchise in Cleveland, but surely there are some talented players out there who are more interested in playing football than in wearing their childhood team’s jersey. rainponcho87 says: Feb 10, 2017 6:42 PM \nNot surprised. This is representative of the millennial generation. You start out assuming you are uniquely valuable and entitled to have your dreams realized immediately. Feb 10, 2017 6:48 PM \nSuddenly, Deshaun Watson doesn’t look so bad right now. \nIf I am Cleveland? I would seriously consider trading down a couple spots for a kings ransom. \nI hear the “once in a generation talent” thing being thrown around. That only goes so far, ask Jamarcus Russell. You have to draft a professional, not a kid in a mans body. Trade down a spot or 2, pick up another 1 next year, and draft Allen. Cleveland has a lot of needs, pass rush is one need but if you watch their games(and outside of their fanbase I don’t blame you if you did not), their interior rush defense is just…just awful. Danny Shelton needs serious help next to him, and I would argue that if you are going BPA you look at Allen, than seriously consider Defensive Back at 12. \nThis QB class is trash, and this isn’t a 1 year rebuild or anything, just chill on QB, grab one of the insane amount of Veterans on a 1 year deal(like a Cutler or something), and wait until next year when you can grab Rosen or USCs dude, among others. Xenu D. Alien says: Feb 10, 2017 6:51 PM \nLooks like a kid just having some fun to me. I can’t blame him for wanting to play for his home team. habsfanatic says: Feb 10, 2017 7:00 PM \nI think this kid should worry about how his future teammates would react if Cleveland drafts him. Not sure Mr Thomas would be pleased with those comments! Feb 10, 2017 7:00 PM \nIf the Browns take Garrett, we may have another “Elway to Marino” saga unfolding. fbwangus8736 says: Feb 10, 2017 7:00 PM \nravenmadnky says: Feb 10, 2017 6:32 PM Yeah, if I’m Cleveland, I’m giving up the #1 pick for an old, broken-down, overpriced Romo and some ham sandwich draft picks. Uh huh. Sure. \nWell they are the Browns! 1phillyphan says: Feb 10, 2017 7:06 PM \nWow, telling the owner to trade away his favorite player and draft picks just to draft you? Not smart kid. Way to isolate 31 other teams. Praying Cleveland drafts you now.. DrSteveBrule says: Feb 10, 2017 7:16 PM \nJust film yourself smoking pot out of a gas mask bong, fall out of second story hotel window, and shoplift. You’ll drop enough spots! Feb 10, 2017 7:18 PM \nWeak. Very weak. He needs a characterless team like Oakland/Vegas/San Antonio/Mehico City. \nAldon Smith would welcome this crybaby with open arms and have celebration bongs with him. Feb 10, 2017 7:19 PM \n“Hey stupid, look at me!” -Michael Kyle homerhunter says: Feb 10, 2017 7:21 PM \nTotally digging the jobless fan boys here plotting strategy and trades for teams they have no access to or intelligence to deal with. Have another Mommy Basement Big Mac home boys! mrfrostyj says: Feb 10, 2017 7:25 PM \nThis was fine up until he started trading away people in a locker room he’s not in. He’s a football player acting like a fan. At this point this guy might end up falling to Dallas in the 3rd round and if he does will probably be forced to dress in the womens restroom for disrespecting a veteran. The cowboys aren’t trading up for him and if the Browns pass on him it’s going to cause his stock to fall pretty far. At this point his agent might be questioning the business he chose to be in with the money that his client is trying to throw away. \nThen again he might end up like the last draft pick to beg his home town to pick him (Brady Quinn) and when they do get him after his draft stock fell try to extort them for the money he felt he should have gotten had he got picked where he thought he should have. mellimac says: Feb 10, 2017 7:27 PM \nI strongly believe a player should be able to ask his fav team that he wants to play for them, but offering up Romo as bait is a bit classless. He needs an agent to keep him from making vids like this… Let the agent do the talking behind the scenes… sopadegato says: Feb 10, 2017 7:30 PM \nWhat kind of talent wants to spend five years of your career – five years that you may not ever make it past – on the most mismanaged team in the league? \nJust refuse. It worked for Eli Manning, didn’t it? Just look how many Super Bowls he’d have won with the Chargers. no drooling,chippy,tpet,Vancouver,crybabies allowed says: Feb 10, 2017 7:31 PM \nAwkward for everyone. I thought most kids grew up excited to be playing on ANY NFL team. I guess not. Sheesh! cardinealsfan20 says: Feb 10, 2017 7:35 PM \nIt’s harmless fun. And Garrett will very soon have millions more dollars than the posters telling him to stay off their lawns. mi6agent says: Feb 10, 2017 7:36 PM \nSo dumb and childish. He really hurts his stock as most draft boards will put an asterisk next to his name = “immature + unprofessional”. Perhaps, he was under influence when making and posting that video?
