UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 10 hours ago 2 US prog thrashers Vektor have announced that guitarist Erik Nelson (in the band since 2004), drummer Blake Anderson (in the band since 2007), and bassist Frank Chin (in the band since 2008) left the band, leaving singer/guitarist/founder David DiSanto as the sole member of the act. The news comes after the success of the group's latest third studio album \" Terminal Redux ,\" which was hailed by the metal community around the globe, and also ranked among the Best Albums of 2016 according to UG community. In a subsequently-deleted Facebook post, the three guys noted: \"Greetings Vektonauts. With sadness we must inform you that we - Blake, Frank, and Erik - are all departing from Vektor effective immediately. It has been a completely incredible 10-ish years that has brought us all around the world and introduced us to so many super generous, passionate, friendly people and produced three albums of which we are extremely proud. Seeing the reception for 'Terminal Redux' in particular after all of the hard work put into it has been very humbling. \"Sadly, we've reached a point where we can't continue with the working arrangement we have, for a number of reasons that we find unnecessary to discuss publicly. There's no big story or drama, people and personalities simply change and drift apart and we've reached our limit. \"The three of us are lifer musicians and will continue to be. You'll be seeing us in other contexts, other bands, recordings, tours, and more. Our time in Vektor has been a major part of our lives and parting with that will be a serious adjustment, but ultimately we're excited to see other new ways we can put our ideas to use. We are -hugely- grateful to everyone that came out to shows, picked up merch, listened to the music, showed us a great time and kept us going. We accomplished more than we ever thought was possible when we joined and we hope you'll stay tuned for what we do next - you have certainly not seen the last of us. \"We don't know if this means Dave will seek new members and continue Vektor or not, that is for him to decide and announce in his own time. \"Given that it's the holidays and the future of the band is out of our hands, we'd appreciate some space for the time being as we enjoy time with friends and family (please don't message our personal pages about it, we won't reply). All the best and we'll see you down the road. -Blake, Frank, and Erik\" DiSanto then posted the following announcement, which is still available on the band's page: \"I apologize to anyone who was concerned about the post from earlier today. Vektor is not stopping. I started writing Vektor songs in 1999 and I'm still writing Vektor songs. As long as I live, Vektor will not die. \"I appreciate everything that Blake, Frank, and Erik have done to help this ship take off. I also appreciate all of my band mates before them: Willy, Pablo, Adam, Mike, and Kian. See you on the road! -Dave\" If you still haven't checked out \"Terminal Redux,\" you can do it in the player below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:03:18.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
