Subri?\nYou've probably never heard of Malaysian soccer player Mohd Faiz Subri, but he just joined some of his sport's biggest names by picking up a rare honor.\nSEE ALSO: The most dad-ass dad sneaker of all time just became even more dad\nSubri won FIFA's Puskas Award for best goal of the year at Monday night's ceremony honoring all things soccer in 2016. The Best FIFA Football Awards also saw trophies given to the year's top men's and women's players, best coaches and more. But it's Subri who was recognized for creating the year's most astonishing scoring moment among a field that also included Neymar and Lionel Messi.\nSubri scored on a long, swerving free kick that seemed to defy the laws of physics before finding the net in a Malaysian Super League match in February. Here's a look at his award-winning strike.\nThe #PuskasAward for best goal of 2016 goes to Mohd Faiz Subri. Who needs physics ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘€ pic.twitter.com/IWfpfkDXwJ\nâ€” BigSport (@BigSportGB) January 9, 2017\nThe Puskas Award winner was determined by an online fan vote, according to FIFA. Past winners include Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Now you can add Subri's name to the list.\n\"This is the best moment of my life,\" Subri said after picking up his hardware, per ESPN.com . \"I never imagined that I would ever win this award. My first thought was to ring my family because without them I would not be a professional footballer.\"\n\"This is an award not just for me and my club but for the whole of Malaysia,\" he added. \"When I went up on the stage to collect it, I honestly didn't know what to say. I couldn't believe that I was in the same company as some of the true greats of football.\"\nQuite a day for the 29-year-old Malaysian.
