Shares \nCayne, the point-and-click horror-adventure from Stasis studio The Brotherhood, will be released tomorrow on Steam . Promised as part of the 2013 Stasis Kickstarter, the \"prequel chapter\" has been built \"from the ground up,\" as developer Chris Bischoff explained last year , which is why it's taken so long to complete, and it will be free for everyone. \nCayne follows the story of Hadley, a woman nine months pregnant who awakens in a mysterious facility with no memory of how she got there. It promises fully-rendered 3D characters and HD backgrounds, professional voice acting, FMV sequences, and \"intuitive puzzles to test your deductive skills.\" A \"deluxe content\" upgrade, with 4K wallpapers, the game script, and the soundtrack, will also be available for purchase. \nExperience with Stasis isn't necessary—Cayne is an \"adjunct story\"—but it is a really good game, so if that sort of blood-soaked horror experience is your thing, I'd definitely recommend it. You can get a feel for what's in store in the trailer below. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Andy Chalk As lead news writer during ‘merican hours, Andy covers the day-to-day events that keep PC gaming so interesting, exciting, and occasionally maddening. He’s fond of RPGs, FPSs, dungeons, Myst, and the glorious irony of his parents buying him a TRS-80 instead of an Atari so he wouldn't end up wasting his life on videogames.
