I don't want him to quit on his stool, or go down with a body shot. I wouldn't be happy with that. David Haye \n\"I'm looking at hitting him, knocking him out, and hitting him as he's going down. \n\"We're practicing hitting a falling target. You're not allowed to hit someone on the floor but, if they're falling, you can hit them. Book the Sky Sports Box Office event here \n\"I really want a slo-mo, show-reel knockout. I don't want him to quit on his stool, or go down with a body shot. I wouldn't be happy with that.\" \nHaye, whose three-and-a-half year hiatus from the ring ended last January, has repeatedly dismissed Bellew's criticism of his warm-weather training camp in Miami. David Haye explains his preparation \n\"If I was fighting Anthony Joshua, I would be doing exactly the same training, because I believe this works for me,\" Haye said. \"The training of old doesn't work for me any more.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:37:50.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
