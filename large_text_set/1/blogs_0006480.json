Woods, who announced the commitment to play Wednesday, won the Farmers in 1999, 2003, 2005-08 and 2013. \nHe also won his last major at   Open in a 19-hole playoff against Rocco Mediate. \nWoods last played on the PGA Tour in the 2015 Wyndham Championship, where he tied for 10th. The winner of 79 Tour titles and 14 majors made his return to competitive golf a month ago in the Hero World Challenge at Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas. He finished 15th in the field of 18 but he, along with winner Hideki Matsuyama, led the field with 24 birdies. \nMORE GOLF: Former pro golfer Wayne Westner commits suicide in South Africa \nAlso on the commitment list are world No. 1 Jason Day, defending tournament champion Brandt Snedeker, reigning U.S. Open champion Dustin Johnson, reigning PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker, Olympic gold medalist Justin Rose, Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler and three-time Farmers champion Phil Mickelson. \nPHOTOS:Tiger Woods' return to competitive golf Facebook Posted!
