Faced with the challenge of creating his debut couture collection as artistic director of the house in just eight weeks, Dior and I follows Raf on an intense, high-pressured journey, while paying homage to the seamstresses who help make his beautiful collection come to life. Valentino: The Last Emperor (2008) \nAlmost 50 years after founding his fashion house in 1959, Valentino Garavani, one of the world’s most celebrated designers, announced his retirement in 2007. Valentino: The Last Emperor explores the professional and personal life of the designer, paying tribute to his career as he prepares for his final show, and taking a closer look at the relationship between him and his long-term partner in business and life, Giancarlo Giammetti. Alexa Chung: The Future Of Fashion (2015) \n“ The Future of Fashion is a mission to uncover the depth of the industry and the huge variety of roles that go towards sending clothes down the catwalk season after season,” explains Vogue contributing editor Alexa Chung, who set out to investigate the truth about the fashion industry with her Vogue Video series by asking the questions everybody wants answers to. From finding out first-hand from Olivier Rousteing how he rose to the ranks of fashion royalty at Balmain, to exploring how to secure a job at Vogue , Alexa brings her signature charm and wit to give an insider view of the ins and outs of the fashion world. \nImage: Getty Jeremy Scott: The People's Designer (2015) \nThe People’s Designer tells Jeremy Scott’s Cinderella story, from rags to riches – or, rather, from small town in Missouri to creative director of Moschino. Originally from humble beginnings, Jeremy endured obstacle after obstacle to get to where he is today; this film takes a closer look at the man behind the flamboyant, tongue-in-cheek designs. Watch out for cameos from a host of his celeb super-fans, including Miley Cyrus, Rita Ora, Katy Perry and the Hilton sisters. \nImage: Getty Lagerfeld Confidential (2007) \nWhat does a day in the life of Karl Lagerfeld look like? Lagerfeld Confidential gives you an idea, with its peek inside the everyday routine of the famously private designer. Karl opens up about his German upbringing and early career, allowing the camera to follow him to intimate spaces, from his chaotic Parisian apartment to a flight in a private jet, giving viewers an insight into the man behind the infamous dark glasses. \nImage: Getty Bill Cunningham New York (2010) \nBill Cunningham New York portrays the late photographer and longtime New York Times contributor at work. The original street style snapper, Bill made his name photographing the colourful streets of New York, getting around the city via his trademark bicycle. He was renowned within the industry, beloved by all. As Anna Wintour explains in the film, “We all get dressed for Bill”. \nImage: Getty Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel (2011) \nBefore editors were personalities, before street style stars and bloggers were the trendsetters, there was the vivacious empress of fashion: Diana Vreeland, the editor who helped bring the industry into the modern age during the Sixties. This film takes a look at her life, from society girl, to Vogue editor-in-chief, to mainspring behind the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, telling the story of exactly how she became one of the most legendary fashion editors to date. \nImage: Getty Iris (2014) \nInstantly recognisable thanks to her signature oversized Jackie O-style frames and New Yorker-drawl, Iris Apfel’s sartorial flamboyance has earned her a firm place as one of New York society’s most legendary style icons – at the grand old age of 95. Iris is an in-depth portrait of the business woman. At the heart of the film lies her unwavering energy, with her free spirit and vivacious nature reminding us that (as clichéd as it might sound) fashion is fleeting, but style really is ageless. \nImage: Getty The Director: An Evolution in Three Acts (2013) \nIt now seems almost impossible to imagine a Gucci without Alessandro Michele at the helm. But not so long ago, the Italian brand was under the direction of Frida Giannini, from 2006 through to 2014. The Director – the brain child of James Franco – follows the famously press-shy designer, exploring the past, present and future of Frida’s Gucci over the course of three collections. \nImage: Getty The September Issue (2009) \nThe aptly-named documentary follows the making of American Vogue ’s 2007 September issue, traditionally the most important issue of the year (interestingly, that particular issue remains US Vogue’s largest to date). At the time, the documentary gave the public unprecedented access to the inner workings of Vogue ; although it’s intriguing watching Anna Wintour hard at work, it’s Grace Codington – the magazine’s former creative director – who really steals the show, her flame-red hair and stead-fast passion helping to shatter Devil Wears Prada myths that surround ideas of what working at US Vogue is really like. \nImage: Getty In Vogue: The Editor's Eye (2015) \nA few years later, the US Vogue editors returned to screens with In Vogue: The Editor’s Eye , commemorating the magazine’s 120th anniversary. Rather than focusing on a specific issue, it takes a look at how some of the publication’s most famous editorials came to life. As well as the editors, many a famous face that has contributed to the magazine’s legacy makes an appearance, with the film featuring interviews with design talents such as Marc Jacobs and Nicolas Ghesquière, and Hollywood stars including Sarah Jessica Parker and Nicole Kidman. \nImage: Getty Mademoiselle C (2013) \nMademoiselle C follows former Paris Vogue editor-in-chief Carine Roitfeld on her quest to found her new publication CR Fashion Book , following her departure from Condé Nast. Friend of Karl Lagerfeld, muse to Tom Ford (both of whom cameo in the film), Carine’s rich and interesting life is exposed as she sets out, with her debut magazine, to create new fashion agenda. \nImage: Getty L'Amour Fou (2010) \nAs Saint Laurent is about to get a new look courtesy of Anthony Vaccarello, there hasn’t been a better time to take a closer look at the figure who founded the eponymous French label. L’Amour Fou does this and more, not only exploring the life of the man behind the namesake label, but focusing in particular on the relationship between him and Pierre Bergé, the designer’s partner in both business and life. Absolutely Fashion: Inside British Vogue (2016) \nTo celebrate British Vogue’s centenary, the BBC was given unprecedented access to the goings on behind the closed doors of our Hanover Square HQ. Expect to get up close and personal with key members of the Vogue team, and spy some of fashion’s most beloved faces, including Kate Moss, Edie Campbell and Mario Testino. \nImage: Getty Inside Dior (2016) \nFollowing Raf Simons’ exit last year, this two-part documentary goes behind the scenes of the hunt for a new creative director, following in the footsteps of Yves Saint Laurent, John Galliano and, of course, Christian Dior. Celebrating the brand’s 70th anniversary, the series offers a unique insight into the luxury French fashion house and this transitional period between designers in the lead up to the appointment of Maria Grazia Chiuri, who was previously at Valentino. \nImage: Getty This article originally appeared on Vogue.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:04:18.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
