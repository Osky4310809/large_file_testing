It was published as Julie lay dying in a Merseyside hospice herself. \nThey wanted the world to know how much they loved each other - and were together until the very end. The Bennet family in happier times \nFamily friend, Heather Heaton Gallagher, a spokesperson for the children, said: “Words cannot express our desperate sadness for such a beautiful family. \n“The Bennets are known to all for their generosity, their love for life, and their down to earth approach. \n\"Julie has kept the children in a normal routine whilst dealing with Mike’s illness over the past few years. \n“When Julie became ill, she made it her purpose to create as many memories as a family for the children to hold onto.” \nAnd she added: “Facing a double terminal cancer diagnosis is beyond belief and, as a community, we are working hard to support the family so that they can stay together and ensure that they can continue their education as planned.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Cancer victim slams NHS care in a heartbreaking video Share this video Watch Next \nDad Mike had been fighting a battle with cancer since 2013 - having been diagnosed with a brain tumour - and had been nursed at home by Julie and the children. \nThe 57-year-old was a self-employed cabinet maker who had served his apprenticeship with Baldock’s Furniture Makers in Liverpool. \nMum Julie, 50, a primary school teacher at Somerville School, Wallasey, was diagnosed with cancer in May 2016. \nShe had liver and kidney cancer which spread to other parts of her body. \nIn the heartbreaking image shared by the children, Julie clings to her dying husband Mike’s hand, as she says goodbye to him. \nMike died last Monday, February 6, surrounded by Julie and their children.

When faced with a devastating diagnosis, she never gave up, she was always focused on taking care of other people, I recall a rare moment of sadness she shared with me, saying: ‘My children don’t deserve this’ and that was Julie, no matter how upset she was personally her focus was on her kids.” \nAnyone who wants to support the family with raffle prizes for fundraiser events or to help in the campaign please contact Sue Wright on 07471030500 and go to JustGiving .
