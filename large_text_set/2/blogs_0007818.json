At the time, it didn’t seem like anything particularly interesting was happened, but upon a closer look there truly was a mine of very cloudy diamonds to be found. \nAdvertisement \n\nWe could discuss Jax sitting in church looking like he expected to burst into flames any minute. There was also Tom Sandavol trying to revive his modeling career by agreeing to a photo shoot with Joe Simpson—one where a case of Coors Light was somehow necessary. We listened to the guys meticulously plot their plans to dress in drag during the bachelor party while Kristin’s boyfriend Carter wondered how he got here. \n\nEven with all that, we have to move on.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nWe’ll start with James because it’s good to just get him out of the way. James and his girlfriend go on a date where she moans about needing a glass of chardonnay which is too bad because she’s 19. \n\nThey recap the events of the previous night when two women who James definitely cheated on his girlfriend with approached him after his deeply embarrassing rap performance. (Trump is out here trying to deport and keep out Muslims while the actual scourges of our nation run free.) \nHis girlfriend rightfully questions how the two women have his clothing and pictures in bed with him. James explains this away with a lie that is almost impressive in its inanity. This poor girl is so simple and if I cared more I might feel bad watching James lie about how he’s not going to cheat on her while she’s in Sonoma. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:17:37.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
