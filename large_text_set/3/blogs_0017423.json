RIGHT: Safaricom chief executive Bob Collymore. By MAUREEN KAKAH \nBlogger Cyprian Nyakundi sentenced to four months imprisonment or ordered to pay a fine of Sh 300,000 for contempt of court by Lady Justice Njunguna. \nMr Nyakundi was sentenced in a case he is accused of defaming Safaricom chief executive Bob Collymore. \nMr Collymore sought orders to have Mr Nyakundi jailed for disobeying an injunction issued on July 18, 2016, blocking him from publishing defamatory articles concerning alleged corruption in the media industry in Kenya. \nLady Justice had on December 02, 2016 ruled that the blogger had acted in contempt of court for publishing information about Mr Collymore despite temporary orders stopping him from the same. \nThe dispute started way back in June when Mr Collymore and his predecessor Michael Joseph sued the blogger for publishing alleged defamatory statements about them. \nLady Justice Njuguna issued temporary orders stopping Mr Nyakundi from making any further publications on his blog- cnyakundi.com about the two. \nBut when he was summoned to appear in court in person to explain himself in person, he apologized for his behaviour while claiming that his posts were merely fair comments on a public interest matter. \nDespite this apology, he went ahead and published another article disparaging Mr Collymore.
