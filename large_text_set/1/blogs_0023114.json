Trump’s executive actions have not gone over well with the press, and Conway has, in just a week, absorbed a lot of the fall out. \nPirro asked what it was like being the focus of enough anger that she needs “ around the clock security .” \n“What is it like for you now? You know, there’s Sean Spicer, he’s in front of cameras, and Reince Priebus,” Pirro said, “and yet, you’re the one that people are focused on. Why do you think that is? Why do you need around the clock security?” \nConway was assigned Secret Service protection after multiple letters containing white substances were sent to her home. She also received death threats . The Secret Service hasn’t released any information on potential investigations into the death threats or letters. \n“Well, there have been threats to me and my family,” she said. “It turns out that there are people who have a problem with women in power, and many of them are women, unfortunately.” (RELATED: ‘I’m A Mother, A Wife, And A Catholic’: Kellyanne Conway Addresses March For Life) \nWATCH: \nEarlier in the week, Conway appeared on NBC’s “Meet The Press” to defend the inauguration audience and said the Trump White House was using “alternative facts” to back up its figures. To her credit, Press Secretary Sean Spicer gave a presser the very next day and noted some of those alternatives — cable and internet viewership — but the damage was already done. “Alternative facts” trended on Twitter. Memes flew around. A tidal wave of online commentary began. \n“I just want them to know, you’re wasting your breath. Because there’s no way anyone is going to redefine or unravel me in 140 characters or less. Why do women feel better about themselves by putting someone down?” (RELATED: Kellyanne Conway Reveals Her Stance On Feminism) \nConway said she “didn’t see the point” of the Women’s March on Washington Jan. 21 — the day after Trump’s inauguration. The march brought hundreds of thousands of people to Washington, D.C., to protest against Trump and for a host of issues like Black Lives Matter, LGBT rights, global warming and abortion. She later spoke at the March for Life Friday.
