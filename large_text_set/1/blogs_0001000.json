REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/Files 5402999 \nBurglars in Midtown Manhattan stole $6 million in jewelry on New Year’s Eve. \nThree men in masks broke into Gregg Ruth jewelry store on West 36th Street in Manhattan at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, The New York Post reports . The robbers were just blocks away while some 7,000 police patrolled Times Square as thousands gathered to watch the ball drop at midnight. \nThe burglars were caught on video inside Gregg Ruth. One of the robbers, a young white male with a beard, looked directly into the camera as they took the jewelry. The three men broke into the shop using a hammer and crowbar, gaining access to four safes filled with diamonds, gold bracelets, earrings and necklaces. The men were only able to hit two of the four safes, but still made out with quite a haul. While it is unclear how the men broke into the safes, authorities believe they were either open or the robbers knew the combinations beforehand, the Post reports. The men exited the building via a stairwell and are still at large. WATCH: Embed: ABC7 New York City The two remaining safes had around $7 million in merchandise. The store’s owner hired a security guard to stand guard outside the building Monday. \nSend tips to [email protected] Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
