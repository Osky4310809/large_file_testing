Rand Paul (R-KY) doubled down on a claim he made last week suggesting jail time for the parties behind the leak. Partial transcript as follows: PAUL: I think it’s unseemly that people in our intelligence community, the CIA director, is out there giving press conferences, criticizing the incoming president — I think that’s inexcusable and I would not have anybody in the CIA that’s publicly criticizing the president. It’s not their job, it’s not their role and it’s frankly, unseemly, and it takes away from the credibility. Look, the intelligence community has had a great loss of credibility in the last couple of years. James Clapper came to the Senate and lied under oath. Now we have the head of the CIA publicly criticizing the incoming president. I think that’s not the role of the CIA. The CIA should be in the background trying to protect our country and not out there trying to score political points. I think it’s a terrible and tragic day, and it hurts all of our intelligence", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T05:45:03.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
