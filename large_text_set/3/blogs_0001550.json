Photography \nWhen Joe Jonas found out that he’d be stripping down to nothing but underwear with Charlotte McKinney for their GUESS campaign, only one thought came to his mind: \"I gotta stop eating this piece of cake right now.” To prep for the super-sexy photos, the DNCE frontman, 27, picked up a rigorous three-and-a-half-month diet and exercise routine — but not without indulging a bit first. \"Once I said yes, we were like, ‘It's the last meal' and we just went crazy,” Jonas told Us Weekly exclusively at the Thursday, March 2, launch of GUESS’ new men’s underwear line, HERO, at Macy's in NYC. \"I had a lot of pasta and a lot of beer, because I didn’t have any beer during the training process.” Of the big night out, he joked: \"I think I had one too many that night!” Hollywood's Shirtless Hunks! \nLuckily, Jonas didn’t have to workout on his own. “Nick is always in the gym,” he tells Us of his younger brother. “He lifts heavy weight and I never really did that.” Jonas also noted that he and Nick have slightly different demeanors when training. \"He’s that guy who screams at the gym with his cut-off sleeves,” he joked. \"I’m just like, 'OK, cool bro.’” \nJonas was also joined for workouts, which are now a part of his daily routine, by his DNCE band members, Cole Whittle , JinJoo Lee , and Jack Lawless . \"Cole does a lot of boxing, so we sometimes mess around and hold pads for each other,” Jonas explained to Us . “We all kind of had goals that we wanted to train for.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T07:10:26.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
