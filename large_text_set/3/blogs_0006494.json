PORT ST. LUCIE — Team Israel entered the World Baseball Classic as seemingly little more than a novelty, ranked just 41st in the world, but with some familiar names such as Ike Davis and Ryan Lavarnway.\nAfter two games, it’s looking more like a powerhouse.\nWith Tuesday’s 15-7 rout over Taiwan in Seoul, Israel improved to 2-0 in Pool A. With a victory over the Netherlands on Wednesday, the Cinderella squad — consisting mostly of journeyman minor leaguers with some Jewish heritage — would win the pool and improbably advance to the second round in Tokyo.\nStill, despite wins over Taiwan (ranked No. 4 in the world) and South Korea (ranked No. 3), manager Jerry Weinstein isn’t celebrating yet.\n“One of the goals here is not to put the cart before the horse,” Weinstein said. “We’re not in the second round yet.”\nYour browser does not support iframes. True, but they’ve already drawn some attention, including in the Mets clubhouse on Monday, when players watched Davis, the ex-Met, draw a walk that led to the winning run over South Korea.\n“For us, for me, this is a huge deal to help possibly kick-start baseball in Israel,” Davis said, according to MLB.com . “It isn’t as big as we’d like, and I think we can change that with what we’re doing.”\nThere is only one native-born Israeli on the roster: Shlomo Lipetz, a 38-year-old sidearm pitcher who played at UC San Diego and whose day job is as the music director at City Winery, a concert venue in downtown New York.\nThe Mensch on the Bench exists and will be traveling to Seoul, Korea, with Team Israel and Cody @Decker6 for first round of @WBCBaseball . pic.twitter.com/HuKCVL7lXC \n— Barry M. Bloom (@Boomskie) February 20, 2017 Adding to Team Israel’s plucky can-do spirit is its unofficial mascot: the “Mensch on a Bench,” a large, mustachioed stuffed toy that reclines in their dugout.\n“He had his own locker,” utility man Cody Decker explained during the qualifying rounds, “and we even gave him offerings: Manischewitz, gelt and gefilte fish.”\nIn the win over Taiwan, with the Mensch observing, Israel got a three-run homer from Nate Freiman, a former A’s first baseman, and a two-run homer from Lavarnway, the one-time Red Sox catcher out of Yale.\nDavis added a pair of RBIs and Corey Baker tossed 4 2/3 scoreless innings before Israel held off a late rally by Taiwan.\nThere’s a long way to go before a Hollywood ending comes into sight — the championship game is March 22 at Dodger Stadium — but Israel already has pulled off two of the biggest surprises in the history of the WBC.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:20:40.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
