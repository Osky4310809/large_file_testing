The Portugal international was whistled and booed from the pitch by the Camp Nou faithful as he was substituted off during Barca's edgy 2-1 defeat of Leganes in La Liga on Sunday. According to Sport , Gomes, 23, \" suffered it like a personal drama, he is very hurt emotionally because he found out that a majority of Barcelona fans are against him, without further nuances.\" The report added that Gomes \" is going through his worst days\" and Sunday's \" criticism was too much for him to take.\" A summer signing for € 35 million (£29.3 million) from Valencia, per BBC Sport , Gomes has endured a poor debut season with Barca and particularly suffered as the team's performances have dipped in recent weeks. He was started ahead of Ivan Rakitic as Barca were thrashed 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League last week and put in a very poor performance, per beIN Sports USA's David Cartlidge: David Cartlidge @davidjaca Partly blame players coming in, not stepping up. Competition winner André Gomes woeful yet again, not first time. But Lucho to blame too. 2/14/2017, 9:43:30 PM Gomes has started 11 La Liga games this season and played from the the bench on six occasions, but he has failed to earn the confidence of Barcelona's fans. Per Sport , the rest of the Barca side were unimpressed that Gomes was singled out for criticism by the supporters: \" The heavyweights of the dressing room, led by Luis Enrique and [Messi], have tried to cheer him up, reminding him that playing for Barcelona means sometimes you have to pay this kind of price.\" It does seem unfair that he has have taken the brunt of fans' frustrations at recent performances. Football writer Rafael Hernandez urged patience on the part of the former Benfica player: Rafael Hernández @RafaelH117 The André Gomes bashing is incredibly exaggerated, he arrived in a messy season, let’s wait and give him a real shot at making it. 2/20/2017, 8:54:41 AM However, it is undeniable that he has so far failed to live up to his price tag, and he will need to be used intelligently between now and the end of the season by Luis Enrique to get the best out of him and spare him further condemnation.
