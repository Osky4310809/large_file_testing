Long Story \nIf you want to make a playlist that really puts the Spot in Spotify, then rack up the reggae and soft rock tunes. \nThe Scottish SPCA and the University of Glasgow have published the results of a study into the effects of music on dogs, by playing them different genres at a rehoming centre in Dumbarton. \nResearchers played the dogs soft rock, Motown, reggae, pop, and classical. They found that the dogs spent more time lying than standing when music was played, regardless of which genre (presumably, the researchers didn’t spin any guaranteed dancefloor-filling bangers, or the place would have been jumping). By measuring the musical mutts’ heartbeats, they found that stress levels reduced the most when they played reggae and soft rock. \nRELATED: What Your Pet Says About You \nPhD student Amy Bowman said, \"We were keen to explore the effect playing different genres of music had. \n\"It was clear that the physiological and behavioural changes observed were maintained during the trial when the dogs were exposed to a variety of music.\" \nPerhaps most interestingly though, the study suggested that the dogs had individual musical tastes , just like people (which could explain why my childhood pet hated Slipknot but went bonkers for the Friends theme song). Based on these results, a bit of \"Bob Marley & Me\" is surely any self-respecting canine's favourite. \nProf Neil Evans said, \"Overall, the response to different genres was mixed highlighting the possibility that like humans, our canine friends have their own individual music preferences.\" \nThe Scottish SPCA said it would now be investing in sound systems for its kennels. Own The Conversation \nDoes your dog have a better taste in music than you do? Drop This Fact \nStudies suggest that dogs actually enjoy watching other dogs on television.
