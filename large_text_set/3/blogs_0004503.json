When I came into the office, I was greeted by an amazing manager, Ethel, who answered all my questions about insurance coverage. She was so smart and sweet, which is very refreshing from most other offices in New York. In addition, the assistant, Kim, who took my x-rays was kind and very gentle on my mouth. During treatment, Dr. Reyes answered all my concerns regarding my teeth and really took the time to understand my needs and come up with a treatment plan for me. I have never experienced such a compassionate dentist before. She never once tried to rush me out of the office, she was attentive, and actually let me speak about my concerns. I will definitely be returning and recommending all my friends and relatives to come here! Less than a month ago by a Verified Patient Bedside Manner Wait Time She was patient and understanding about my nerves. She took the time to go through all of my history and concerns, and she explained what she was looking at and looking for during the exam. She has Netflix or music to help keep your mind occupied, which I found relaxing. She even broke down what the cost of my next steps would be, which no dentist has done in advance for me before. She also was very responsive to my sensitive spots, so I experienced less discomfort. Great visit.
