Stanek, who is the incoming president of the National Sheriffs Association, was among a small group of sheriffs invited to the West Wing for a meeting with the new president. He said Trump \"was actually very well educated about illegal narcotics,\" and said they had a wide-ranging conversation that also touched on Stanek's hope that the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy would be elevated. Former President Obama de-emphasized the position, and Stanek said he would like to see it restored to where it was under former President George W. Bush — citing 144 heroin/opioid-related deaths in Hennepin County last year. He said the number is of crisis proportion. \"Every single one of them is tragic and every single one of them is preventable,\" Stanek said. \"If we had that many murders, people would be off the charts mad about it.\" Stanek said talking to Trump was refreshing because he asked what he could do to help support law enforcement. He noted when he did similar visits with Obama, it was always usually the other way around. \"With Trump, it was what can he do for us,\" Stanek said, in an interview after the White House meeting. \"He said he had our back, he said he will work with us. I was proud to be there.\" Stanek, a Republican, was first elected sheriff in 2006. He has often been seen as a potential statewide candidate for office, and he previously has admitted to considering a bid for governor of Minnesota in 2018. That's also when his current term as sheriff ends. Trump told the sheriffs he was with them in fighting the war on drugs and reinforced his desire to build a wall on the Mexican border. \"We're committed to securing our borders, especially in border states,\" he said to the roundtable. \"We're going to be building a wall.\" On Trump's executive action on the travel ban, Stanek said he told Trump that his office will \"support the rule of law and due process and proper vetting of individuals.\" Trump's order prohibits people from seven Muslim-majority countries — Somalia, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, Iraq, Iran and Syria — from entering the United States for three months, including refugees and those who were legally permitted to be here before. Judges have halted the order, which Trump defended on Tuesday as \"common sense,\" and said he would fight all the way to the Supreme Court to keep it intact. Minnesota is among the top states nationally for refugee resettlement from the blacklisted countries. Trump is making a speech tomorrow to the bigger group of sheriffs in town. \"I'm looking forward to seeing him again,\" Stanek said. \"President Trump was well versed on our issues.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:04:38.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
