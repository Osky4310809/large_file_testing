His Open Society Foundations have given away more than $13 billion to push his globalist, anti-American views.\nThe media turned the march into a celebration of anti-Trump sentiment and ignored or downplayed negative stories. Those ranged from Soros’ backing of the groups involved, controversial event partners such as the Communist Party and Madonna’s F-bomb laden tirade against President Donald Trump that included her fantasies about “blowing up the White House.”\nOther prominent organizers and supporters of the Woman's March include convicted terrorist Rasmea Odeh, Communist former Black Panther Angela Davis , and convicted torture/murderess Donna Hylton.\nThe Women’s March claimed to stand for “vibrant and diverse communities.” However, it hawked the same worn-out liberal ideals of “LGBTQIA rights” (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex and Asexual), abortion, “environmental justice” and others.\nSoros, the 19th richest man in America with a net worth of $24.9 billion, according Forbes , gave more than $246 million to 100 of the Women’s March partner groups over 14 years. He distributed the money through personal contributions and donations from his Open Society Foundations (OSF). Donation records from OSF are only available for 2000 to 2014, meaning Soros’ total donations were most likely much greater.\nThe biggest recipients included cornerstones of the activist left — the ACLU, Human Rights Watch, Planned Parenthood and Center for American Progress. These four organizations have all worked against conservative values.\nWhy has Soros invested so heavily in these \"worn-out liberal\" groups? Fox News contributor (and mother of eight) Rachel Campos-Duffy answered that question on Fox this morning.\n\"Soros has had a lifelong dream of one-world government of elites redistributing wealth and setting up rules for the rest of us,\" she said. \"And the biggest existential threat to the advancements he's made through his investment in President Obama and also his investment in the Hillary campaign (which he didn't get a lot out of) is Donald Trump.\"\nAccording to Fox News , schools in at least four states canceled classes Wednesday so teachers and staff members could participate in \"Day Without a Woman\" demonstrations.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/09/soros-funded-100-groups-behind-day-without-a-woman-protest/", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jZs7AiZlXf4", "http://www.forbes.com/profile/george-soros/?list=billionaires", "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/03/08/day-without-woman-strike-shuts-down-schools-as-teachers-bolt.html", "http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/26/womens-march-featured-speaker-who-kidnapped-raped-and-tortured-a-man/", "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/11/jury-isnt-out-on-angela-davis/", "https://www.womensmarch.com/principles/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE9z-XYFY-M", "http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/02/27/womens-strike-organizer-convicted-terrorist-rasmea-yousef-odeh", "http://www.mrc.org/special-reports/marching-soros-tune-100-womens-march-partners-funded-left-wing-billionaire-0"], "published": "2017-03-09T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:08:39.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
