They were lovely. \n\"We used to go to the same pub as them up the road and they were very friendly.\" \nWest Midlands Police said in a statement: \"A man has been arrested on suspicion of stabbing a woman and her teenage son to death – and seriously injuring her husband – during a knife attack at their Dudley home. A policeman stands guard outside the home (Photo: Birmingham Mail) A police car parked inside the cordon (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \n\"Police and ambulance were called to the property in Greyhound Lane, Norton, just after 8am where a man, woman and a boy were found with serious stab wounds. \n\"There was nothing that could be done to save the woman, understood to be in her 50s, and she was pronounced dead at the scene. \n\"The woman’s 13-year-old son suffered critical stab injuries and was later pronounced dead in hospital. Her husband remains in hospital with stab wounds to his chest and back. Police rushed to the family home at 8am (Photo: Birmingham Mail) Three people were found inside with serious stab wounds (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \n\"A Land Rover stolen from outside the home was intercepted by police at around 8.30am in Norton Road and a man in his 20s arrested. \n\"He is currently in police custody and will later be questioned on suspicion of murder and wounding.\" \nDudley Police Superintendent Lee Kendrick added: “What has unfolded here this morning is horrific and heart-breaking. The road outside remains cordoned off for forensic tests (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \n\"Police and ambulance were confronted with an awful scene: a man, woman and boy all with very serious stab injuries. \n“The woman and boy were found in the house and the man in the garden. \n“Tragically there was nothing that could be done to save the woman – and her son later died in hospital from his injuries. \n\"Our hearts go out to the victims’ family and friends at this devastating news. A map showing where the suspect was arrested in relation to the location of the family home \n“Clearly our investigation is at a very early stage but we understand the suspect was known to the family and may have been living at the address – although he is not a family relative. \n\"We don’t think this was a burglary or a robbery. \n“Our investigation is progressing at pace and we are working to understand exactly what the relationship was between the man and the family. \n\"At this stage we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.” \nAnyone with information is asked to call West Midlands Police on 101.
