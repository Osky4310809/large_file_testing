At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful. \nYates, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama , knew full well this could result in her being fired from her position. Reuters \nWhile it isn’t surprising Trump has terminated Yates after she stood against his unconstitutional ban, and thus upheld the law, it is surprising it happened so swiftly. \nTrump agreed to keep Yates’ on her job until his pick for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Al.), was confirmed by Senate. \nInstead of upholding the agreement, Trump has appointed Dana Boente, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as attorney general until Senator Sessions is confirmed. \nSenator Sessions was considered too racist to be a judge in 1986. Within seconds of Dana Boente being named the acting attorney general, this is what comes up for his Wikipedia page when you search his name pic.twitter.com/SuQKumNGjk \n— John Haltiwanger (@jchaltiwanger) January 31, 2017 \nFiring Yates after she announced the DOJ wouldn’t defend Trump’s ban possibly shows the president does not respect the department’s prosecutorial independence and would rather have another “Yes Man” in his pocket. \nIn a statement released on Donald J. Trump’s Facebook page, he says Yates “betrayed” the Department of Justice. Facebook \nTrump’s ban is already facing a number of lawsuits, and multiple courts have issued orders to release people who have been detained. \nThe executive orders have sparked protests across the United States. \nDemocrats and a number of Republicans have attacked Trump’s order, with a few coming to Yates’ defense including Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Ct.). Sally Yates: person of integrity/attorney with great legal skill. Has served this nation with distinction. Her judgment should be trusted. \n— Eric Holder (@EricHolder) January 31, 2017 \nTrump’s pick for attorney general, Senator Sessions, opposes marriage equality, is a climate change skeptic, is anti-abortion and doesn’t support criminal justice reform or marijuana legalization. \nHe also once fought against legal immigration — because, fuck it, his white ass made it to America so screw everyone else.
