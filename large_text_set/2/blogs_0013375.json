FLOATING ISLAND // ANDREW JACKSON \nAndrew Jackson’s most infamous White House party dish was, without a doubt, the 1400-pound block of cheese that was served at his last public reception. (The damage from the event was so bad, according to Cannon, that cheese was crushed into the carpet and curtains and smeared on the walls of the White House. The next president, Martin van Buren, secured $27,000 from Congress in part to clean up the mess, Cannon says.) At other occasions, Jackson might have served a dish called the Floating Island. Variations of this dessert were popular all over the South; this recipe, which serves 8 to 10, comes from the kitchen of Jackson’s Tennessee home, the Hermitage. \nINGREDIENTS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:53:12.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
