The yesteryear actress was caught in a frame with both, her daughter Jhanvi as well as Sara at two different occasions. In case you guys didn’t know, Saif Ali Khan’s daughter attended GVK scion Keshav Reddy’s sangeet ceremony that was held a day before. Present at the event were a lot of Bollywood actors such as Ranveer Singh, Raveena Tandon, Sridevi Kapoor, Shilpa Shetty and more. Without a doubt, having so many celebs under one roof means only one thing, lots and lots of selfies! And that’s exactly what happened. A lot of pics were clicked at the function including these two, which have recently surfaced. In one pic we see Sara and Sridevi in one frame, in what could be one of the most gorgeous avatars. In another pic shared by the Chandni actress, we see Jhanvi pose in a red hot gown with her mother. Clearly, the two gorgeous divas are going to be touch competitors to each other. ( ALSO READ – This pic of Ranveer Singh and Sara Ali Khan makes us wish rumours of them doing a film together were TRUE ) \nYou can see that in terms of looks, style, appearances and more, they’re both having a neck to neck competition. Well, we can’t really say that it is competition per say but they’ve definitely groomed and prepped pretty well for their Bollywood debut. Just yesterday, in the morning we caught Sridevi along with her daughters at the airport, looking their stylish best and by evening a pic of Sara with Ranveer started going viral! Yes, the star kids are definitely the topic of discussion on social media. Everybody is curious to know when they’ll be making their respective debuts and opposite whom and of course, which director will set their careers soaring. While all speculations of their movies keep happening, let’s take a moment and talk about their ensembles. \nSara Ali Khan I am totally loving what Sara has donned. We spotted the diva-in-the-making twice as she posed next to Sridevi as well as Sandeep Khosla, wearing an Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla ethnic wear. Perhaps it’s her radiant face and the fact that she has learnt the art of pulling off any look because she’s definitely nailing the ethereal look. Doesn’t she look super gorgeous here? Check out her pics below. Jan 28, 2017 at 7:32pm PST \nJhanvi Kapoor We spotted her at the airport as well as at the wedding function. For the wedding, the budding actress has donned a lovely red off shoulder gown. It looks a lot like Manish Malhotra creation but we’ll wait for the designer to put it up officially on his Insta handle. Surely, Jhanvi has got the best of her mother’s genes for she’s looking super hot. Check out the airport pics as well as the wedding pic. \nA photo posted by Sridevi Kapoor (@sridevi.kapoor) on Jan 28, 2017 at 10:00pm PST \nAren’t they both looking drop dead gorgeous? We think they’re going to have a neck to neck competition as they make their Bollywood debut. There have been reports that both the celeb kids will be launched by Karan Johar. Although both of them were supposed to be in Student of the Year’s sequel, we hear that plan has been cancelled. They both wish to have individual releases and not be a part of an ensemble cast. Wise choice ladies! Anyway, who do you thin k nails the ethereal look? Sara or Jhanvi? Tell us in the comments section below oh and do VOTE for the same.
