He deserves to be. \nThe franchise was harmed and Tom Brady had his name dragged through the mud because Goodell had neither the fortitude to tell bitter, jealous loser team owners there was nothing there, or the honesty and skill to run a legitimate investigation. \nAnd there is absolutely nothing wrong with a little booing. \nRead: Hurley: Why Roger Goodell Avoiding Foxboro Is A Big Deal \nI doubt there’s a major sports player or coach who hasn’t heard some boos from time to time. Some of them don’t like it? Too bad. \nUnless you want to force the fans to sit there quietly, you will get the boos along with the cheers. \nIt’s a part of the fabric of American sports that politicians and unpopular celebrities who show their faces at a stadium run the risk of being booed; apparently, it happened at Gillette last weekend when Justin Bieber’s picture was flashed on the scoreboard. \nIf Justin can handle it, so can Goodell. \nSo commissioner, don’t be a sniveling little wuss. \nChange your plans, get up here and take your medicine. \nWe promise we’ll get it all out of our systems in one evening. \nListen to Jon’s commentary: Jon Keller Follow Follow Jon on Twitter E-Mail Jon Keller Jon Keller is WBZ-TV News' Political Analyst, and his \"Keller At Large\" reports on a wide range of topics are regularly featured during WBZ-TV News at 6PM and 11PM.
