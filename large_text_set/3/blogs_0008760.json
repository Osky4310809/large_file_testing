The tight end posted a picture on Instragram of himself signing a contract at Lambeau Field. A post shared by Lance Kendricks (@lkendrix) on Mar 11, 2017 at 2:04pm PST \nGreen Bay confirmed the signing shortly after Kendricksâ€™ Instagram post. \nThis move comes one day after bringing in Martellus Bennett via free agency. \nKendricks spent his first six years in the NFL with the St. Louiis/Los Angeles Rams but was cut earlier in the week in a salary-cap saving move. He emerged as a consistent threat in the passing game, catching 204 passes for 2,132 yards and 17 touchdowns in his career. \nLast season with the Rams, Kendricks had a career-high 50 receptions, totaling 499 yards with two TDs. \nThe 6-foot-3, 240-pound tight end was drafted out of Wisconsin in the second round, No. 47 overall, by the Rams in the 2011 NFL Draft. In 33 games from 2008-10 for the Badgers, Kendricks caught 78 passes for 1,160 yards and eight touchdowns. He was named a consensus All-American after his senior season in 2010. \nThe Packers also have tight end Richard Rodgers, a third-round pick in 2014, on the roster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:53:44.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
