Now, the Trump brand will extend to the animal kingdom with the discovery of Neopalpa donaldtrumpi, a new species of twirler moth named after the politician and real estate magnate. \nThis centimeter-wide moth was identified by evolutionary biologist and lepidopterist Vazrick Nazari, who announced the find in a paper published Tuesday in the open-access journal ZooKeys . Nazari settled on the name N. donaldtrumpi because the silky yellow-white scales these moths develop on their heads in adulthood reminded him of the President-elect’s signature hairdo. Holotype and paratypes of the new species Neopalpa donaldtrumpi . Image: Vazrick Nazari \nThe moth is native to North America, specifically California and Baja Mexico (Trump’s proposed border wall won’t stop this flyer’s migration). \nBy meticulously examining specimens of the moth and its close relatives, Nazari was able to catalogue its unique anatomy, including its male genitalia, which is “comparatively smaller” than the moth’s close relative Neopalpa neonata , according to the study. \nNazari, like Trump, understands the power of good marketing, and hopes that his taxonomical homage to the incoming president will raise awareness about the need to preserve its delicate environment. \n\"The discovery of this distinct micro-moth in the densely populated and otherwise zoologically well-studied southern California underscores the importance of conservation of the fragile habitats that still contain undescribed and threatened species,\" Nazari concludes in the study.
