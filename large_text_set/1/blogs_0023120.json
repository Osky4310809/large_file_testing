If so, was any of it good for the nation? \nHere’s more information about this afternoon’s most talked about EO, the five-year lobbying ban… \nFrom Breitbart : \nPresident Donald J. Trump signed three new executive actions on Saturday afternoon, including a five year lobbying ban, reorganization of the National Security Council, and a plan to defeat the Islamic State. \nFrom the Oval Office, President Trump signed the documents while surrounded by reporters, advisers, and his Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. \nRegarding the lobbying ban, Trump said: \nSo this is a five year lobbying ban, and this is all of the people — most of the people standing behind me will not be able to go to work. \nIt’s a two year ban now and it’s got full of loopholes and this is a five year ban. So you have one last chance to get out. Good, I had a feeling you were going to say that. \nThis was something, the five year ban, that I have been taking a lot about on the campaign trail. \nTrump is taking Washington by storm, and that was the plan from the beginning. \nThe billionaire has been in office for only eight days and he’s already delivered on a number of his campaign promises. \nThis lobbying ban was one of them, if you recall his ‘ Contract with the American Voter .’ \nAgain, we’re just eight days in. \nImagine all the positive steps we can expect Republicans to take over for the next four years!
