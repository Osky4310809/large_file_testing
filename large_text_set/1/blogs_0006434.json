The bright blue Tardis (the Doctor’s time-traveling ship), the unique coats each Doctor wears, but no item holds more significance than the Sonic Screwdriver .\nIt is only fitting that our magic and makeup merging faves, Storybook Cosmetics , would choose the Sonic Screwdriver as their next choice for a makeup brush handle . In the show, which has spanned decades (both season wise and in episodes), the Sonic Screwdriver has a wide variety of uses and is the most important tool that the Doctor has. Kind of like how important our beauty tools are to us when we are not traveling to alien planets.\nSonic Screwdrivers Anyone? So, we've officially finished our conceptual art for our first round of launches. Most of these products depend on licensing. (We are in talks, and will keep you posted!) Keep in mind, an important part of our business model is keeping you all informed. Sometimes things will change, sometimes they will be postponed, and sometimes they won't happen at all. We hope you appreciate being able to follow along through the ups and downs! We have many items already in production, this is a long long process and we are committed to premium quality cosmetics so we won't rush anything. I know it seems like we just draw a lot of pictures, but trust me... amazing, REAL, items are coming soon! ❤️ \nA photo posted by @storybookcosmetics on Jan 3, 2017 at 8:04pm PST \nStorybook promises that there will be more products available soon , informing us on why they post ideas prior to receiving licensing rights:\n“Most of these products depend on licensing.
