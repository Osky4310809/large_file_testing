Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPep Guardiola has hailed the emergence of Leroy Sane as being like a new signing for resurgent Manchester City. \nSane has been one of the Blues ' most consistent performers in recent weeks, as Guardiola’s side have moved up to second in the Premier League and closed to within eight points of leaders Chelsea. \nThe 21-year-old German joined from Schalke in his homeland for £37million last summer, but Guardiola claimed his superb form since the turn of the year has made him more like a January window addition. \nSane set up Raheem Sterling for the opener in City’s 2-0 win at Bournemouth on Monday and has three goals himself in his last six games, as well as contributing three assists.

But, since the game against Arsenal [in mid-December, where he scored in a 2-1 City win], I think he made a click. \n“He showed us a lot of things. He is so fast, his intensity helps us a lot and he helps us defensively, too. And he’s only 21 years old. \n\"I’m so happy for Manchester City, who will have a good player for the next few years.” \nThe stats endorse Guardiola’s view. \nNo City player has averaged more successful dribbles per 90 minutes than Sane, whose work-rate off the ball is equally impressive.

He’s so aggressive when he doesn’t have it [the ball].

They need to be able to recover possession, close down opponents and work just as hard without the ball as they do with it at their feet. \nThat is why it is such a blow for the manager to lose Jesus for much of the rest of the season. The 19-year-old forward's tireless running off the ball is as significant for the manager as his goal-scoring ability. \nIt is why Jesus had made the starting place his ahead of Aguero since arriving from Brazil last month, and why Sane has now made himself indispensable.
