(AP) — Donald Trump was not in attendance at the Golden Globes, but he was there in spirit — or more precisely, as the target of a slew of political barbs, not to mention an impassioned takedown by actress Meryl Streep. \nOnly a few seconds into his monologue, host Jimmy Fallon noted that the Globes was “one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote.” \nHe was just getting started. Fallon went on to compare the president-elect to the evil King Joffrey in “Game of Thrones.” \n“What would it be like if King Joffrey had lived?” Fallon asked. “Well, in 12 days we’re going to find out.” \nIn an interview with the New York Times, Trump said he did not watch the Golden Globes but was “not surprised” he was attacked by “liberal movie people.” \nStreep took things in a much more serious direction, excoriating Trump without mentioning his name in an impassioned speech as she accepted the Cecil B. DeMille Award.

Because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing.” \nTrump took on Streep in a series of early morning tweets Monday, calling her “one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood” and “a Hillary flunky who lost big.” He also reiterated that he wasn’t mocking the disabled reporter. Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a….. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never \"mocked\" a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him……. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 \"groveling\" when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 \nStreep also referenced Trump’s policies on immigration when she pointedly listed the multicultural heritage of many Hollywood actors. \n“Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners and if you kick them all out, you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts,” Streep said, to cheers. \nIn Fallon’s monologue, he referred to a Streep film, “Florence Foster Jenkins,” in which she stars as “the worst opera singer in the world.” Fallon added: “Even she turned down performing at Trump’s inauguration.” \nThe mournful drama “Manchester by the Sea,” he joked, was “the only thing from 2016 that was more depressing than 2016.” He also noted that votes were tabulated by the accounting firm of “Ernst & Young & Putin.” \nHugh Laurie, accepting his award for best supporting actor in “The Night Manager,” also indulged in Trump jokes, speculating that this would perhaps be the last Golden Globes ceremony. \n“I don’t mean to be gloomy, but it has the words ‘Hollywood,’‘foreign’ and ‘press’ in the title,” Laurie said, explaining his pessimism about the awards surviving the Trump era. He added that some Republicans don’t even like the word “association.” \nHe accepted his award “on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T20:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T16:33:06.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
