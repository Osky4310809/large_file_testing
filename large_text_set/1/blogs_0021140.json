(Photo: Jim Brown-USA TODAY Sports) \nWhen Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump, used the term \"alternative facts\" on Sunday to describe White House press secretary Sean Spicer's false claims about crowd size, the internet went predictably wild . \nThe sports world has also joined in. \nWe heard Warriors coach Steve Kerr joke about \"alternative facts,\" and now, Tennessee basketball couldn't resist. The media game notes had an entire section dedicated to \"alternative facts,\" which were, of course, hilariously false.

As was this: \n\"During the 1966-67 season, legendary Vols head coach Ray Mears started using the stopwatch feature on his iPhone (powered, of course, by Verizon) to time Tennessee's offensive possessions during games. When assistant coach Stu Aberdeen inquired about Mears' groundbreaking use of technology, Mears responded, \"I call it my 'shot clock.'\" \nThis seems like a joke we should probably get used to in 2017. It has potential.
