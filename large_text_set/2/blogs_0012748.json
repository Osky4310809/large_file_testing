But these are abnormal times, and the scientific community is on fire, fearful as never before that its values and methods are under threat. High among their priorities are climate change and vaccines, both issues about whose scientific concensus the president has expressed doubts. But in one big way, the fight over these two issues is fundamentally different—and scientists should do everything they can to prevent vaccines from becoming the pitched political fight that climate change has become. Sure, Donald Trump might be our first vaccine-skeptic president, which should cause alarm for anyone who respects science or public health. But before throwing vaccine science into the heat of our ultrapolarized politics, pro-vaccination groups should look at the way extreme partisanship has kneecapped climate change activism. Despite decades of accumulating scientific evidence, the fight has still not shifted from one over whether climate change is created by human activity—a fight over which there is almost no real scientific debate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:32:00.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
