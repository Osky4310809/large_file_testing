Image caption There are 800,000 home care workers in the UK \nOne home care company, Cymorth Llaw, which had contracts with three councils in north Wales, told Panorama it had recently stopped working with one – Conwy, which had initially paid £14.20 an hour for care. \nIt offered to raise that to £15, but the company decided that still wasn’t enough and handed back the contract. \nKen Hogg, at Cymorth Llaw, said: “We didn’t think we could do it for the money – it was as simple as that. \n“We pay as much [in wages] as we possibly can and we’ve always paid above what was the national minimum wage and the national living wage. \n“They get a mileage allowance, they get paid travelling time between their clients.” Image caption Ken Hogg says council funding barely covers his care home company’s costs \nMr Hogg said the company was legally obliged to pay 1% pension and 13.8% national insurance contributions, along with training and other staff-associated costs, which “doesn’t leave a great deal”. \nConwy Council said it was committed to supporting vulnerable people in communities, despite the financial challenges. \nHome care company Mears used to have a contract with Liverpool City Council but cancelled it in July, saying £13.10 an hour was not enough to cover costs. \nMears said it needed at least £15 an hour, and like other companies across the UK, argued its costs are often greater than what councils pay. \nAlan Long, executive director at Mears, said: “That was a terrible thing to do for both service users and for care staff. \n“We absolutely did not take that lightly, but frankly what choice did we have? \n“We just cannot do the two most basic things that you need to do in home care – pay staff the absolute minimum of living wage and be able to recruit enough people to deliver the service that Liverpool Council actually expected from us.” Bed shortages \nThe industry’s trade body, the United Kingdom Homecare Association, said many companies were really struggling. \nColin Angel, its policy and campaigns director, said some care providers are “really desperate” and “really do not know whether they’re going to be able to continue in business, beyond the next year”. \nHe added: “That means they’re really having to make some hard commercial decisions, whether they might need to cease trading or indeed just hand back work to local councils.” \nThe nationwide shortage of carers is leaving many elderly people stuck in NHS wards, which results in bed blocking. \nGovernment figures show there are more than 6,500 people across Britain stuck in an acute hospital bed, despite being well enough to leave. \nIn England, a third of these are waiting for a home care package. Image caption Colin Angel has concerns that more care home companies may close in the coming months \nMike Furlong, manager of the Granby Rehabilitation Unit in Liverpool, told Panorama that while on average people spend 28 days at the care facility, “some patients have been with us 12 and 14 weeks because all the therapy is complete, but unfortunately there’s no care package available at the end of it”. \nLiverpool City Council said that, over the last seven years, its budget had been cut by £330m and it now needed to find a further £90m over the next three years. \nSamih Kalakeche, Liverpool’s director of adult social services, said: “Is there a crisis in the home care services? I’ll say yes, there is – and it’s not just money, it’s the sheer volume of demographics. \n“We’ve got an ageing population which we welcome, but we don’t have enough people coming into the industry.” ‘£2bn extra’ \nEarlier this month, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced £2bn extra for social care for English councils over the next three years. \nScotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales will decide how they spend their extra funding. \nBut the industry says that with an increasingly ageing population, it’s just not enough to keep pace with demand. \nThe government has said it will be bringing forward more proposals later this year, to ensure a financially sustainable social care system. \nPanorama: Britain’s Home Care Crisis – Monday, 20 March, 20:30 GMT, BBC One", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:13:59.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
