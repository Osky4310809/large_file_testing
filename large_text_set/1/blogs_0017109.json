Where does Premier League clubs' revenue come from? \nChampions League holders Real slip to third after 11 years at the top, despite breaking the €600m revenue barrier for the first time. \nThe Deloitte Football Money League measures a club's earnings from matchday revenue, broadcast rights and commercial sources, and ranks them on that basis. The study does not include player transfer fees. \"Manchester United have had to wait 11 years to regain their position as the world's leading revenue-generating club and it has taken phenomenal commercial revenue growth to help them achieve this.\" Dan Jones, Sports Business Group partner at Deloitte \nDan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: \"Manchester United have had to wait 11 years to regain their position as the world's leading revenue-generating club and it has taken phenomenal commercial revenue growth to help them achieve this. \n\"In recent years, their ability to secure commercial partnerships with value in excess of that achievable by their peers has been the crucial factor in enabling the club to regain their place at the top of the Money League. \n\"That said, they'll face strong competition from FC Barcelona and Real Madrid to retain the top spot in next year's edition, due to the lack of Champions League football, the weakening of the pound against the Euro and, over the longer term, as other clubs enter the commercial market demanding similar deals, using United as the precedent.\" \nManchester City sit fifth with £392.6m in revenue and are the next Premier League team on the list, while Arsenal (£350.4m), Chelsea (£334.6m) and Liverpool (£302m) also crack the top ten. \nThe Premier League has eight teams in the top 20 overall, equalling its own record total, with Tottenham (£209.2m), West Ham (£143.8m) and reigning champions Leicester City (£128.7m) also making the cut.
