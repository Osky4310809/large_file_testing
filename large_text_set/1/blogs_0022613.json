She still does her own thinking, and need not subordinate her opinions to those of her husband. In fact, it seems rather sexist to imply otherwise.” Advertisement - story continues below \nThat was a fair argument, especially considering Kaine was the running mate of Hillary Clinton, a candidate who made her potential as the first female president such a big part of her campaign. \nBut the fact that the paper took the time to make an issue out of a relatively minor snafu speaks to how unlikable so many people find Kaine to be, including those in the town where Kaine served as mayor from 1998 to 2001. \nMind you, his unlikability extends beyond Virginia. After the vice presidential debate in October, for example, The Today Show analyst Nicolle Walace noted that Kaine’s behavior at the debate, during which he had repeatedly interrupted then-Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, was in itself “unlikable.” \nFor a reminder of what that looked like, play the video below: \nWhat a schlub — an unlikable and possibly even “sexist” one. Thank goodness he is not America’s vice president.
