As a doctor, when I am well equipped with training and remuneration, I will deliver better. \nOn her part, President- elect, of ARD, Psychiatric hospital, Yaba, Dr. Bolanle Ajayi,, urged Nigerians to join NARD in the quest to reform the health sector as healthcare was a business that concerned all. \nShe appealed to the Federal Government to adhere to its part of the agreement to prevent incessant strike actions in the health sector. \n”This is a fight not only for doctors, but for the health of all Nigerians. We should not forget that average Nigerians are the victims of the deploring state of our healthcare sector, not our leaders, ” Ajayi said. \nThe National Executive Council meeting on Jan. 17, 2017 in Abuja, the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) declared a seven-day warning strike action which commenced Jan. 18 to end midnight today. \nSequel to this, NARD urged all centres to participate and to ensure compliance. This strike is due to the Federal Government’s refusal to yield to the demands made by NARD.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T10:51:12.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
