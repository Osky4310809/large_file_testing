I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let’s do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down.”\nThe Football Association’s rules on betting say: “A participant shall not bet, either directly or indirectly, or instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet on (i) the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in, a football match or competition.”\nSafe to say that after the initial, hilarious reaction, people on Twitter didn't really like that it was a PR stunt:\nSo about this goalie eating a pie. Turns out, the Sun were offering bets before the match on whether he'd do exactly this. https://t.co/lpGRjUAQHd\n— Dai Lama (@WelshDalaiLama) February 20, 2017\n@TeleFootball like his reserve goalkeeper taking backhanders from the sun for something they took bets on????\n— marlon (@inthesmoke) February 21, 2017\nSomeone put up, that the pie eating in the #SuttonvArsenal #FACup match was an advertised bet and PR stunt by The Sun Bets.\n— Gerry Bennison (@AlresfordBear) February 21, 2017\n@TomBlargh FA Cup last night, non-league side had a fat goalie who ate a pie on the bench. The Sun happened to be taking bets on it.\n— Ingobernable Dazzler (@DanTheDazzler) February 21, 2017\nSutton sold their soul to the sun today. The sun were also taking bets on the keeper to eat a pie during the game. And shock horror he did..\n— Steve Elliott (@Teeto_Wxm) February 20, 2017\nTurns out The Sun bets were offering odds on this happening. Massive publicity stunt.\n— David (@davidlewissmart) February 20, 2017\nIt gets worse.
