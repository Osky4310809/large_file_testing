Even during deep-sea fishing and on farm dates, not a shiny strand was out of place. And when she returned to our TV screens for Bachelor in Paradise , you guessed it, her hair still looked damn good when she was outside all day in the humidity. Lucky for all of us, Caila Quinn spilled her hair secrets to Allure . We recently chatted with the 25-year-old to find out which products she can't (and can) live without, what curling iron she uses, and what tips she picked up from Jojo Fletcher and Becca Tilley . The key to flawless hair is her blow-drying technique. Before Quinn curls her hair, she blow dries it using a technique she calls \"bookends.\" First, she starts with her bangs and the crown of her head to add volume. Then, she blow dries her ends. After that, she does the middle. Why? \"This keeps the middle smooth, but also gives the top and the bottom some bounce,\" Quinn tells Allure . Then, she takes her time curling her hair, starting with the bottom layer working her way to the top.

Before Quinn appeared on national television in hopes of winning the heart of Ben H., she used the same curling iron , shampoo, and conditioner she's using right now. \"I've used the same one-and-a-quarter-inch barrel from Conair for almost 10 years,\" Quinn says. That's right, her now-famous curls have been a decade in the making, and she taught herself how to do them all on her own. \"I would always just practice and curl,\" she says. \"I never watched tutorials, but I knew what worked well for me.\" Her love of Biolage shampoo and conditioner hasn't changed either. \"The same one I use now is the same one I used on The Bachelor and in high school,\" she admits. \"I have always loved the scent and the luxury feel of them.\" And in case you were wondering, she only uses the conditioner on her ends twice a week.

She's been using her all-time favorite, moisture product since high school, too. \"Once a week, I deep-condition all of my hair—except the roots—with Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist ,\" Quinn says. Not only is it inexpensive, it's also keeps her hair on point. \"Whether it's a date in Jamaica or on the beaches of Paradise or traveling in Switzerland, it keeps my ends smooth and my hair healthy,\" she says. When it was time for her to pack for The Bachelor , she made sure to bring enough to last her until the last rose ceremony. \"I was like, 'It'll be a red alert emergency if I run out of Aussie 3 Minute Miracle ,'\" she recounts. \"They tell you that you can't shop or anything, so basically I brought one bottle per month I think, even though one bottle can last you three months.\" You probably won't guess what she doesn't use. \"I think my hair secret is, I don't use too many products,\" Quinn says. \"I like the airiness of not using too much. I'm a firm believer in never using hairspray because I find it really clumpy and kind of synthetic looking.\" Instead, she lightly sprays on Not Your Mother's Double Take Dry Finish Texture Spray before and after curling her hair. \"I find that it reduces frizz,\" she says. Brushes aren't part of her beauty routine either. She likes to use her fingers to piece through her hair. \"Those natural oils that your body emotes kind of smoothes out the hair,\" Quinn explains. Loading View on Instagram Being on The Bachelor taught her about the wonders of dry shampoo. \"I didn't know what dry shampoo was until I went on the show,\" she says. \"I saw JoJo and Becca using Dove Refresh + Care Dry Shampoo .\" In turn, she curled the other contestants's hair. \"A lot of them had used wands,\" she says. \"I find wands very scary with the whole glove thing, and I'm not a big fan of the beachy wave look. I like the classic big curl look. I would take my barrel curler and curl some of the girls hair, like Jubilee and Rachel and Shushanna.\" Now, Quinn's a fan of the Drybar Detox Dry Shampoo . \"The scent is nice and light, and it's easy to travel with,\" she says. The latter came in handy when she left for Bachelor in Paradise . \"I definitely remembered to bring dry shampoo because it's an even stickier, more humid climate,\" she says. Quinn picked up some makeup tips while on The Bachelor , too. \"Another thing that I learned from the girls on the show was the magic of Benefit Hello Flawless Powder Foundation,\" she says. \"They have a honey color that almost all the girls used. It's, like, the perfect compact. I would consider it to be quintessential Bachelor makeup product. When we were in airports, they had little Benefit vending machines, so I bought my first one. I've been using it ever since. When I walk out the door, I never leave without my Flawless Powder.\" More Bachelor beauty secrets revealed:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:45:45.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
