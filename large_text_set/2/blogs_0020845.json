Most of them can be found in south Goa, particularly Agonda, Palolem, and Patnem beaches. You'll also find a few on the less developed north Goa beaches, such as the Arambol to Morjim stretch. Read: Goa Beach Guide, Which Beach is Best for You? \nUnfortunately, the beach huts are no longer cheap places to stay though. Rates have been jumping substantially every year, and it's a case of paying for location, location, location. Compared to what you'd get at a hotel for the same price, facilities are minimal. Part of the reason is because the huts have to be pulled down every year and reconstructed for the season, which runs from around November to May. \nThese 10 Goa huts all offer something a little more special than others in their areas. Dwarka Eco Beach Resort cottages. Sharell Cook. 1. Dwarka Eco Beach Resort, Cola \nParadise found is the first thing that comes to mind at the exclusive Dwarka Eco Beach Resort. Tranquilly and seclusion abound with 10 stylish cottages, set amid a sprawling palm grove that borders a lagoon right next to the ocean. Nature is a focus and it's as idyllic as it sounds! To get there, you have to drive through villages and down a dirt road. The location is little-known Cola beach (not to be mistaken with Colva beach) in south Goa, with the closest beaches being Agonda and Benaulim. Expect to pay 8,000 rupees upwards, for a double. The rate includes breakfast, lunch, evening tea/cookies and dinner. More » \ncontinue reading below our video Beware! The 5 Most Common Travel Scams Little Palm Grove beach hut. Sharell Cook. 2.

They're stylish and comfortable, and come with king size bed, porch, and hammock. There's also a restaurant that serves healthy and tasty food on the premises. The location, at hip Ashwem beach (between Morjim and Mandrem), is one of the most peaceful places in north Goa. Yet, it's close enough to more lively Arambol in case you've had enough relaxing and feel like some entertainment. Two minutes walk along the beach and you'll find the smaller and quieter Little Palm Grove , also with six gorgeous bamboo cottages on the beach. Some have perfect sea views! Expect to pay around 8,500 rupees per night, including tax and breakfast. More » Hut at Yab Yum. Sharell Cook. 3. Yab Yum Resort, Ashwem \nYab Yum Resort is a true oasis right by Ashwem beach.

Each dome has its own individual outside space for dining or lazing in a hammock. The Honey Pod and Suite Pod are particularly secluded near the ocean. There's a health and wellness focus, with Ayurvedic massages, yoga and fresh organic food. You definitely won't go hungry staying there! Rates start from 4,000 rupees per night for a standard dome, including a substantial breakfast and taxes. More » Village Susegat. 4. Village Susegat, Morjim \nSusegat means to totally relax and take it easy in Konkani (the language spoken in Goa). Village Susegat is an offshoot of Villa Susegat -- a successful guesthouse run by a British couple. They've now expanded their business and have transformed a neglected palm grove on Morjim beach (around 20 minutes from Anjuna) into what is now “Village Susegat”. The village consists of sixteen solidly built beach huts (so the plumbing does work!) and a beach cafe and bar, Cafe Bar Susegat. Everything has been personally designed and built by the couple, including handcrafting the furniture and fittings. Rates start from 3,500 rupees per hut, per night, and decrease according to the length of stay. And the best thing: the rates remain the same all year round, even over the busy Christmas and New Year period. More » Ozran Heights. 5. Ozran Heights, Vagator \nOzran Heights isn't situated right on the beach but you'd struggle to get a better view of the ocean and sunset anywhere else. The 14 wooden huts are perched on a cliff with sweeping views of Little Vagator!

Rates start from 3,000 rupees for a garden hut. Expect to pay 5,500 rupees per night for one of the new sea view huts. Simrose also has a healthy restaurant that serves as much food from organic farms as possible, and its own yoga shala under the palm trees.

Expect to pay 4,500 rupees per night upwards for a cottage. More » The Art Resort 9.

The restaurant serves fine Indian and European cuisine, and the Chill Out Bar a selection of fresh juices and expertly mixed cocktails. There's often live music.

Cuba Premium Beach Huts, Palolem \nThe very popular Cuba Beach Bungalows has 16 colorful huts set in a semi circle shape, so all huts get at least some view of the beach. The location is central, and staff are friendly and helpful. The crowd is predominantly young and up for a good time, and there's a bar close to the huts, so do take that into consideration when deciding whether to stay here. The vibe is definitely one of fun. Rates start from around 3,000 rupees per night and increase dramatically during December-January. They are pricier than many standard huts, but Cuba's justification is the range of services provided.
