Oh my God.’ I don’t look at them like that.” Matching \nA post shared by bb (@brooklynbeckham) on Jan 8, 2017 at 7:56am PST \nBrooklyn Beckham went on to say that, despite having famous parents, he hoped his photography book would prove that he was talented and more than just his parents’ son.\n“It’s pretty exciting to put my work out there,” he said, “and show people that I’m not just doing it because of my parents are.” While on a recent family vacation skiing, Brooklyn recently suffered a broken collarbone after having an accident snowboarding .\nBroke my collarbone at the end \nA post shared by bb (@brooklynbeckham) on Feb 17, 2017 at 10:46am PST \nJust before his accident ...

Over the Christmas period, 12-year-old Cruz released his first song , the adorable “If Everyday Was Christmas .”\nWe’re wishing Brooklyn well after his accident, and hope he has a speedy recovery. What’s more, we can’t wait to see his photography book when that’s released in May!\nThank you @christianoita @wonderland!
