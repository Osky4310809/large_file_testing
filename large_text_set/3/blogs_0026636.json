It’s the place where one can spend an entire paycheck in a single hour. Although you might believe you’re finding the best-of-the-best when it comes to HomeGoods home décor, there’s always room for improvement. For instance, did you know that late mornings and early afternoons are allegedly the best time to visit HomeGoods ? You learn something new everyday !\nAccording to the brain behind the @HomeGoodsObsessed Instagram account, Christine Lee, late mornings and early afternoons — specifically Tuesdays through Fridays — are prime HomeGoods shopping hours .\nThe store isn’t as crowded because people are at work during this time. Flamingo cuteness overload with these @raedunnclay small plates • $3.99 \nA post shared by @homegoodsobsessed on Mar 22, 2017 at 10:21am PDT \nLee talked to People about her HomeGoods shopping techniques and added, “I avoid weekends at all costs because of the mad rush and bumper to bumper shopping cart traffic. By the time Monday rolls around, the stores seems to be busy recovering, re-shelving, and re-stocking.” So when Tuesday hits, HomeGoods is stocked back up and ready for your business! This chair, wine, and a good book. \nA post shared by @homegoodsobsessed on Mar 12, 2017 at 9:56pm PDT \nAnother HomeGoods tip Lee shared with People has to do with looking at the big items first. Keep track of the larger items you like. If you notice that they’ve been sitting around for a few weeks, that means they’re most likely going to go on sale. At that point, pounce!\nLove me a mirrored table, super glam and sophisticated! \nA post shared by @homegoodsobsessed on Mar 14, 2017 at 10:30am PDT \nOne of our favorite tips from Lee is to buy now and think later. She explained to People, \n“Individual items are not well-stocked at HomeGoods, which gives the whole experience the ‘thrill of the hunt.’ My advice is to go ahead and just buy it! I’ve had one too many moments where I’ve kicked myself for sitting on the fence about something.” As long as you keep your receipt, you can return any item you buy within 30 days. Brilliant! Everyday is a great day for Chanel #timetoshopthebluesaway \nA post shared by @homegoodsobsessed on Nov 9, 2016 at 8:16am PST \nMake sure to shop the entire store, including all the forgotten about sections. Lee told People that HomeGoods has recently gotten in some great stationary sets similar to those you can find at PaperSource. You truly find some treasures when you dig!\nLee, you’ve given us the HomeGoods shopping bug. We just cleared our late mornings/early afternoons, Tuesday through Friday, if anyone would like to join us to do some home décor hunting!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:30:06.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
