Here’s a short film showcasing some of their heartfelt responses. These stories speak volumes about the impact of this policy on our employees and their families. We’re very encouraged by early results, though it’s still too soon to comprehensively assess the full ramifications of our changes. \nSince Etsy’s new parental leave policy took effect, 48 employees have taken leave: 50% identify as men, and 50% as women. (For context, people who identify as women comprise roughly 54% of Etsy’s overall staff, according to our most recent diversity report ). \nFrom our early findings, we’re proud to say that taking generous parental leave has not negatively impacted our employees’ careers. Of those who have taken the new parental leave, 35% have been promoted since April, which means they were promoted either soon before, during or after taking leave. Of those who were promoted, 41% advanced to director level or above. \nConsidering we announced this policy less than a year ago — and employees can schedule their leave over the course of two years — it’s early days, and we know there’s still much to learn. In the coming months we’ll be working to better assess how many eligible employees are using all of their leave and we look forward to sharing more insights as they develop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:59:16.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
