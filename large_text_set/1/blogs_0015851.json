Among the other 208 people whose sentences Obama commuted were Puerto Rican activist Oscar López Rivera as well as San Francisco Giants legend ( and cove namesake ) Willie McCovey.

Fellow Hall of Famer Duke Snider was also convicted in the case, and McCovey got two years probation and a $5,000 fine. \nMcCovey, now 79, works as a senior adviser for the Giants. He made one World Series with the Giants (which he unfortunately ended with a hard lineout at the end of Game 7). McCovey had a real penchant for smacking the dick off the ball, a skill which is the Giants commemorated by naming the cove right outside of their ballpark after him.
