Advertisement – story continues below \nGosnell is currently serving a life sentence in a state prison in Huntingdon, Pa. \nThe doctor was charged with operating a “house of horrors” abortion clinic in the Powelton Village neighborhood of Philadelphia. \nHe faced charges that he used scissors to stab some aborted babies that were still alive in a procedure he referred to as “snipping.” He also allegedly fed parts of aborted babies to crabs inhabiting the water near his residence.
