He never had an aura of intellectual arrogance. He basically he was very humble and very honorable and very caring,” Brownstein said. \nHyatt retired as a partner from the firm in 1991, although he continued to take on a few tax cases. Even though Hyatt’s involvement diminished over time, Brownstein and Farber turned to him often for advice. They never removed his second billing from the firm now called Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. \n“We kept his name because his leadership and integrity were a foundation of the firm. We felt that he deserved the recognition,” Brownstein said. \nAaron Hyatt, Jack’s nephew, said a desire to spend more time with his daughters and to care for his aging mother motivated the early retirement. The firm’s success, plus his skills at managing his investments, left his uncle in a position not only to retire at age 50, but to stay retired. \nFarber said Hyatt made giving back to the community a priority at the firm. Among the causes Hyatt devoted his time and resources to were JEWISHcolorado, Mental Health Colorado and the University of Colorado Law School. \nOne of the causes Hyatt invested in most heavily was Aaron, whose father Hank died when he was only nine months old. \n“He was always there for me and always there for others,” Aaron said. \nJack’s influence as a mentor was so strong on Aaron that he followed his uncle into real estate law at the firm his uncle helped start. \nHyatt was very disciplined about his diet and exercise, jumping rope 45 minutes a day. He was healthy, but started having back and other health issues about five months ago, Aaron said. Back surgery in January resulted in complications and things took a severe turn Saturday before last, when Jack Hyatt was diagnosed with late-stage and incurable melanoma. \nOn Wednesday, Farber and Brownstein spent three hours reminiscing with Hyatt about the early days of what had become a law firm with 250 employees, 11 offices and a reputation as a lobbying powerhouse in Washington, D.C. \n“My expression to Jack was that we did this like brothers, we were close like brothers,” Farber said. \nHyatt is survived by his wife, Andrea; his daughters Holly, Hope and Alyson; and his three grandchildren. A memorial service is planned Monday at the the BMH-BJ Congregation at 560. S. Monaco Parkway, followed by burial at the Emanuel Cemetery at Fairmount.
