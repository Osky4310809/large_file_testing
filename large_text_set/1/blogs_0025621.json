It covers a four-page sheet which I’ve got on my desk, but one page is blank, and another page comprises just the title. Here is the text of the bill itself. AndrewSparrow (@AndrewSparrow) January 31, 2017 \nBeside it I have also got a rather longer document, the notice of amendments. This is the list of all the amendments that have been tabled by MPs and opposition parties and it runs to 85 pages. MPs will debate them, and vote on a select few, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week. That, in theory, is when the debate should get most interesting, because at that point the bill can be changed. \nExcept now it is looking as looking as if the bill may pass the Commons without any significant amendments being passed at all. My colleagues Rowena Mason and Anushka Asthana explain more here in their story. Brexit bill set to pass without amendment as Tory rebels back off Read more \nOne factor is that Tory MPs who had been threatening to cause trouble seem to be satisfied, now that the government has agreed to publish a white paper on its Brexit plans. Nicky Morgan , the former education secretary, has raised concerns about Brexit before (she was strongly pro-remain), but she told the Today programme this morning she was not planning to back any amendments to the bill. She told the programme: \nMy instinct is no at the moment, not to support any amendments. \nMorgan was on the programme with Owen Smith , the Labour MP who challenged Jeremy Corbyn unsuccessfully for the leadership last summer. He said he thought the article 50 bill vote would be the most important he would ever cast and he said that he would be voting against, defying the Labour whip for the first time in his career. Asked why, he explained: \nI don’t think democracy started or ended on June 23 and, in my view, the decisions to leave the European Union is going to leave the constituents I represent worse off. And it is also playing into a politics that is meaner, meaner spirited, than we’ve had in our country traditionally, and I think it is time for the Labour party to stand up for people and to stand up for what we believe is genuinely in their interests. \nHe also accused the government of lying about Brexit. \nAnd I fear that we are still being lied to, lied to during the referendum campaign and lied to still about how easy this is going to be or about the benefits that we will see on the other side of Brexit. \nWhen he was asked if he was really accusing Theresa May of lying, he explained: \nI think she’s dissembling when she says thinks like ‘I’m going to make Britain a global trading nation’. I’m sitting here in the middle of London, the most cosmopolitan, global city in the world. We are the sixth largest economy in the world. We are one of the great trading nations and have been for centuries. The notion the European Union has held us back in that regard and that we are going to suddenly overcome our long-term productivity problems by leaving and becoming even more global is, frankly, for the birds. \nThe debate starts at about 12.40pm and we will be covering it in detail until it ends at 12pm tonight. MPs do not actually vote tomorrow, but the opening speeches may reveal more details about the government and the opposition’s approach to Brexit and, given all that is at stake, the debate itself is set to be a momentous parliamentary occasion. \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n9.45am: Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee. \n9.45am: Nick Gibb, the education minister, gives evidence to the Commons education committee. \nAround 12.40pm: MPs begin debating the second reading of the European Union (notification of withdrawal) bill. The debate will go on until midnight and then carry on tomorrow, with MPs voting at 7pm on Wednesday. \nThis morning I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, but later I will be focusing mostly or entirely on the article 50 debate. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.
