He also had five rebounds and four assists in the wire-to-wire win. \n“It’s a good win for us. We play some tough teams in our next games against San Miguel, TNT, and Rain or Shine,” said coach Franz Pumaren. “At least, this is a buffer for us.” ADVERTISEMENT \nThe Road Warriors managed to trim the Batang Pier’s 50-38 halftime lead to just five, 59-54, but Stanley Pringle anchored a 12-0 run to give them a 71-54 edge with 3:58 left in the third. \nJosh Urbiztondo padded the lead to 21, 82-61, but was met by another rally from NLEX until JR Quinahan stepped on the gas pedal and sealed the deal for the Batang Pier. \n“One thing I really appreciate is they’re starting to accept their roles, and even the bench guys are accepting their roles,” noted Pumaren, as GlobalPort improved to 5-3 card. \nPringle fired 20 markers, seven dimes, five boards, and two steals, while Quinahan added 18 points and seven rebounds. \nPapot Paredes also chipped in 13 markers and six boards in the conquest. \nNLEX once again fell to the cellar with a 2-6 record. \nCarlo Lastimosa topped the Road Warriors with 19 points, six assists, and five rebounds in the loss, while Sean Anthony got 16 markers, nine boards, and five dimes off the bench.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T17:42:42.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
