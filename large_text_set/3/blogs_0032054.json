He later co-hosted the short-lived talk show The Revolution and turned to food shows, hosting TNT's On the Menu and the Food Network's American Diner Revival . Pennington has also made many guest appearances on Rachael Ray . A post shared by Genevieve Gorder (@genevievegorder) on Mar 16, 2017 at 9:09am PDT \nGenevieve Gorder: The Trading Spaces interior designer went on to host her own shows, such as HGTV's Dear Genevieve , in which she helps viewers who had written in with their design problems, and HGTV's White House Christmas , in which she prepared the White House for the holidays for the Obamas for eight years. Gorder was also a judge on HGTV's Design Star between 2009 and 2012. \n\"Now I'm moving to a network I cannot name!\" Gorder told E! News exclusively and cryptically Wednesday. \"There are multiple projects going on with multiple networks so until those contracts are signed, I can't say anything but I'll say I'm launching my line of Land of Nod furniture tonight. So yeah, that's a really big one! There's wallpaper and rugs.\" \n\"And I've been a bit all over the world,\" she added. \"I just did a show in Asia, which is airing now, called The Apartment . So I guess I've been busy!\" Photos A post shared by Christi's (@christis_shop) on Dec 2, 2016 at 4:07pm PST \nChristi Proctor Hurst: Trading Spaces was her first and last reality show. Her last work in production was as an interior designer for the 2013 indie film Where We Started . \nNowadays, she focuses on her boutique in Waco, Texas, Christi's Interiors. \n\"A couple years ago, I decided to open a new little retail store downtown,\" she said. \"And I have a wholesale bedding line that I manufacture here in Texas, that I sell through the markets and it's called Moon Rein. It's a custom bedding line, it's really high end, and so I thought, well, why don't I just sell my bedding as well at the wholesale market and sell other things and just have a boutique? And so that's what I started. It's downtown and so I also do my design business out of there as well.\" \nHurst said customers recognize her from TV and reminisce about Trading Spaces . \n\"People come in and they talk to me and say, 'Oh my God we just miss watching everybody together and seeing the families,\" she said. A post shared by Kia Steave-Dickerson (@kiathedesigner) on Nov 29, 2015 at 11:15am PST \nKia Steave-Dickerson: The designer quit appearing on television after Trading Spaces but continued to work in the industry as a prop master. \n\"For seven years I didn't work in the industry,\" she said. \"I just did design work...before the show, I worked in the film and television industry, but behind the camera, for years before I did Trading Spaces . I told my friend Kevin (an amazing prop master) who wanted me to come work on 30 Rock at the time, 'You know Kevin, I can't come work on 30 Rock . Maybe when my son turns 7 I'll come back.' Three weeks after my son turned seven, Kevin called me and said 'Okay Kia, you gotta come work on the new Rocky movie. Your father worked on the first one and you may never get this opportunity again.'\" \n\"I ended up working on Creed , not knowing that Rocky is now rebirthed and there's a whole new generation of fans for the franchise,\" she continued. \"So I ended up working on Creed and from Creed that took me to Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and I've just completed shooting the third season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt as the assistant prop master to Kevin Ladson . So yeah, I'm working with Tina Fey , who is also from Philadelphia, so we're having a great time.\" \nSteave-Dickerson's son turns 10 this year. \n\"He's still getting used to when people ask to take a picture with me,\" she told E! News. \"When people are like, 'Can I take a picture with your mom?' he's like, 'What?' He's just realizing it. Like the ladies at school will be like, 'That's your mom!?' but to him it's no big deal.\" \nBarry Wood: After starring on Trading Spaces between 2004 and 2007, he appeared on the HGTV show Hidden Potential . In recent years, he concentrated on his work with his company b.wood Architects. \n\"I'm an architect and a construction manager so I am doing a great deal of work for the U.S. government actually on a lot of design and construction for a lot of different types of facilities like academic buildings, marine academy, a baseball field,\" Wood told E! News. \"A lot of our clients are GSA and White House and Social Security and USDA and Department of Labor. I'm doing all kinds of large scale designing and constructing.\" Photos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:13:24.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
