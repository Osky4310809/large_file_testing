And if we know that our words can change minds and hearts, if our presence can save lives, then why shouldn’t we be out here as frequently as we can to make a difference?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:10:10.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
