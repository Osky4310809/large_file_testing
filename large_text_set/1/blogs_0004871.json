It not only delved into ideas of mortality and spirituality, but also revisited themes from the entirety of his incredible career. At that point, everything about his already shocking death took on a deeper, more poetic significance, which probably was his intention. \nNow, a full orbit around the sun later, the Starman’s passing feels just as monumental. For many, his death was a sign of the crap that was to come in 2016. I don’t know about that, but we survived it and for a lot of us, the music he left behind helped. Starting this weekend and continuing throughout the month, there are nearly as many Bowie celebrations as there were when he first left us. So take note Bowie lovers: You’re not alone! Oh no, love! Here’s where to turn on with him and be wonderful in his memory (including, full disclosure, two events at which I'll be DJing). Edward Transsylvania \nFriday, Jan. 6 Hot Tramp, I Love You So!
