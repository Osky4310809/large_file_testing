A new Artlist.io update makes a strong case for choosing music licensing over stock music. \nChoosing music for your film can be an overwhelming task. While many filmmakers understandably wish this wasn't the case, there comes a time when you simply have to let go of temp music and launch yourself into a relentless search through libraries, reaching out to artists, paying them their dues, and hoping they only hit you with a one-time fee. \nBefore you start making those decisions, however, it's best to have a plan of action. Your first question should be, \"stock music or music licensing?\" Stock Music \nTo be sure, there are benefits to both. Stock music, for example, is easily accessible in all types of styles—and most importantly, it’s cheap. For around $20-50, you can get a song for private or commercial purposes. The downside? It's stock music. Like any media item preceded by the term \"stock,\" these are mostly generic-sounding productions with not much artistic emotion or passionate production value. Many times, if you do find a great song, you also have to consider that it has most likely been used thousands of times by other video makers. \nStock music is unique in that the rights belong wholly to a particular company, also known as a library. The library either selects pieces for purchase from artists or employs musicians to work on specific projects, receiving royalties whenever their music is used. This keeps the customer on the hook, forcing them to pay additional fees whenever they use the tracks they purchased. Artlist.io Music Licensing \nIn contrast, traditional music licensing allows filmmakers to purchase rights to use genuine, artistic musical works from established musicians and composers. For the most part, the quality and feel are dramatically superior to most stock music The downside is you are going to pay dearly for it and the terms are far more restrictive. \nIn today’s filmmaking landscape, stock music has come to dominate the industry simply because the vast majority of films are low budget. Sadly, this has limited the available work for great musicians, decreasing the quality of the music you generally hear in video. \nHowever, there are forward-thinking companies like Artlist that have used subscription models to get genuine composers back in the game and give affordable music access to filmmakers. This is a leading trend as the music licensing industry finds new ways to meet the advances of the filmmaking industry. \nArtlist has integrated all the familiar tools that filmmakers use to find music, including powerful new filtering and search options, project organization, and much more, including: \n600+ new songs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T20:23:58.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
