We are hoping to give the Barmy Army a run for its money next year.” \nHennessy has called for official recognition of the day for the iconic Test captain, who died in 2015 aged 84. \n“We’d love day two at the SCG to be known as the Richie Benaud day,” Hennessy said. “Whether it be informally or formally we want day two to be about Richie.” \nAbout 80 Shane Warne lookalikes were on hand to watch Australia dominate on Tuesday.
