Their book, however, was not going to be a how-to guide for would-be flippers. \nRather it was to be “inspirational self-help” in which the El Moussas discussed obstacles they had overcome in life, and offered advice on how the reader could do the same, Yamashita said. \nThat could be awkward at this point. \n“The circumstances are much different now” from when the publisher (a division of Penguin Random House) first acquired the book, she said. \nTarek filed for divorce in January, his publicist confirmed to the Associated Press , offering no further comment at the time. The filing came one month after the couple announced they were separating, and seven months after police were called to their home over what the couple called an \"unfortunate misunderstanding.\" \nDespite their estrangement, the El Moussas, who have two young children, and HGTV have said the TV show will continue. 13 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lArkFl NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
