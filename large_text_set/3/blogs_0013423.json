By Rob Owen / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nABC’s filmed-in-Pittsburgh comedy \"Downward Dog\" finally has an air date. \nThe show will sneak preview at 9:30 p.m. May 17 after the season finale of \"Modern Family\" and move into its regular time slot, 8 p.m. Tuesday, on May 23, the day before the end of the 2016-17 TV season. \nAt one point ABC executives had thought of pairing \"Downward Dog\" with \"Bachelorette\" and airing episodes back-to-back. That's no longer the plan, which bodes better for the show's odds of success, although a summer run is still not ideal for any show. \n“Downward Dog” stars Allison Tolman (“Fargo”) as Nan, a single Pittsburgh woman with a dog, Martin (Ned), whose narcissistic thoughts are heard by viewers (but not by Nan). That high concept for the show — a talking dog!?! — makes it a comedy outlier. \nCreated by Pittsburghers Michael Killen and Samm Hodges, who also voices Martin, “Downward Dog” filmed its pilot in Pittsburgh in December 2015 and returned to shoot the balance of its episodes in fall 2016. \nTV writer Rob Owen: rowen@post-gazette.com or 412-263-2582.
