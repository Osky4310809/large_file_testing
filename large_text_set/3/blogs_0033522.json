Well, at 36-39 they're one game back of Miami and Indiana for the final playoff spot, and both of those teams have a harder remaining schedule: Miami's last four are at Toronto and Washington, then home vs. the Cavs and Wizards; Indiana plays at Toronto and Cleveland and hosts the Raptors, Bucks and Hawks. \nThe Bulls, meanwhile, face only one team with a winning record in their final seven games. Here's a look at Chicago's easy path to the playoffs: David Banks Vs. Atlanta Hawks, Sat., April 1 \nThe Hawks (39-36) are the last team with a winning record that the Bulls will face in the regular season. Atlanta has had Chicago's number, winning the first three matchups, but the Hawks have been limping to the finish line, losing seven of their past 10 games. \nButler's had games of 40 and 39 against Atlanta this season, and one more big performance could be the charm. @ Pelicans, Sun., April 2 \nHeading down to New Orleans won't be an easy back-to-back, especially now that the Pels have DeMarcus Cousins, making them a bigger threat than the team the Bulls beat back in January. Anthony Davis went off for 36 and 14 in that one, and Boogie gives them a 1-2 punch that the Bulls don't have with Wade out. But the Pels haven't made a playoff push since acquiring Cousins, proving to be a bit of a disappointment. Matt Bush @ Knicks, Tues., April 4 \nHow about one more round of Derrick Rose vs. his old team? There won't be much more motivation for the Knicks, who are 2-8 in their past 10 but 2-0 against the Bulls this season, with one win coming while Butler was sidelined. Rose hasn't exactly lit it up, averaging 16 points and seven assists. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP @ 76ers, Thurs., April 6 \nThe Bulls blew a home game against the Sixers earlier this week after winning their first two matchups, so they'll have to atone for the loss with a win in Philly. Butler had 36 in that game but Dario Saric went for 32 and 10, boosting his case for Rookie of the Year. Chicago can't afford another letdown against these guys. @ Nets, Sat., April 8 \nThe Bulls wrap up this crucial four-game trip at Brooklyn, having beaten the Nets twice this season, including a Butler buzzer-beater in a 40-point night back in December. Vs. Magic, Mon., April 10 \nThe Bulls have won two of three against the Magic, losing at Orlando earlier this month as Elfrid Payton had a triple-double with 22, 14 and 14. The Magic are 3-7 in their past 10 and coming off an OT loss to the Thunder in which they blew a 21-point lead. Ouch. NBAE NBAE/Getty Images Vs. Nets, Wed., April 12 \nOne more Lopez brothers battle for good luck. The Nets have the worst record in the NBA, and the Bulls can put a big, shiny bow on it as the finishing touch for that No. 1 draft pick. \nSo there it is: seven games against teams that the Bulls have a combined 7-7 record against. The Bulls will have to beat these bad teams to give themselves a shot at the postseason. Can they do it? Not much in this season makes you think they can, but then again who thought they'd sweep the Cavs and cause some concern about a possible first-round matchup?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:13:57.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
