The unknown is certainly a terrifying place.\" \nWow. \nBosworth went on in her post to describe more about her depression, as well as some of the ways she's pulling herself up out of it — the entire thing can be read HERE . \nShe also shared a new YT video (below): \nPowerful, powerful stuff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T00:23:52.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
