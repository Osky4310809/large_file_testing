The embassy has not explained whether the cardboard Trudeau was ever actually used.\nRegardless, it will now have to go into storage.\n“We are aware of instances where our missions in the United States had decided to purchase and use these cut-outs,” Global Affairs spokeswoman Natasha Nystrom told The Canadian Press in an email.\n“The missions have been asked to no longer use these for their events.”\nIt’s not clear if the missions ever had departmental permission to use the cardboard cut-outs.\nAccording to emails obtained by the Conservatives through the Access to Information Act, the Washington embassy’s interest in using a cardboard likeness was sparked by word that the Atlanta consulate had put one on display at a pre-Canada Day event last year.\nRelated ‘I’m not bragging’: Matthew Perry says he once beat up Justin Trudeau when they were kids Chris Selley: The Trudeau Liberals’ weirdness managed to get even weirder on International Women’s Day Liberal backbenchers vote against Trudeau, pass law banning genetic discrimination Asked if Ottawa had given permission, Louise Blais, the Atlanta consul general, advised the embassy that she did ask but “never got an answer.”\n“Which I took as no objections. But as added cover, the U.S. embassy in Ottawa has one of the Obamas.”\nAnna Gibbs, senior events production manager at the Washington embassy, was excited about the prospect of putting Trudeau’s image on display.\n“I think this will be a hoot and extremely popular and go well with our Snapchat filter,” she wrote in an email.\nWhile some of her colleagues felt the magnified photo of Trudeau in a black suit, black shirt and silver tie “doesn’t seem very prime ministerial,” Gibbs gushed: “Looks (oh so) fine to me!”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:58:56.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
