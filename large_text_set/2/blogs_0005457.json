Juan, Juan, Juan... @Cuadrado from DOWNTOWN lifts the roof off Juventus Stadium!! #JuveInter #FINOALLAFINE pic.twitter.com/ztvFlcyAHz â€” JuventusFC (@juventusfcen) February 5, 2017 \nHandanovic kept out Miralem Pjanic's free-kick at full stretch, but the subsequent corner fell kindly for Cuadrado to drive a stunning strike high into the net from 25 yards. \nPjanic was again denied by Handanovic, low to the goalkeeper's left, early in the second period, while Gagliardini turned a header over the top for Inter. \nIcardi led a counter for the visitors, opting to go for goal himself and blazing over, and Pioli's side were then grateful to Handanovic as sharp saves from Higuain and Mandzukic kept them in the game. \nJeison Murillo's curler missed the top-left corner as Inter attacked time and time again in the closing stages, but their final roll of the dice ended with a red card for Perisic. \nWith Handanovic forward for a corner, referee Nicola Rizzoli spotted a foul, booking the goalkeeper for his protests and then dismissing Perisic after an aggressive confrontation in the final act of a thrilling, fiery clash.
