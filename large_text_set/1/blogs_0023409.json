Palmer told King she denied access to her image three times: once to the producer, once to an assistant and then once to Songz.\n“I wasn’t in the right mind,” she says. “I had been drinking and eating and it wasn’t a professional environment. It was not a place where I’m like, ‘I’m in the right mind to decide if this works with my bran, if I like the artist, if I like what the song says.'”\nShe called the experience “sexual intimidation,” saying as a female she is “put in situations sometimes where males use their masculinity, their sexuality to taunt you.”\nPalmer told King she would pursue legal action, despite the video being taken down.\n“It’s out and it’s over, but, more so, my point isn’t to say it’s not about this person, this guy, and what he did,” she says. “It’s the overall idea that you can’t just do stuff to people and it’s all right, no matter who you are.”\nPalmer blasted Songz on Instagram on Monday, after he released the video for his remix with Fabolous to the Travis Scott and Young Thug song “Pick Up the Phone” on Friday.\nThis is preposterous. How am I in this video Trey? After you found me in a closet HIDING because I was so afraid of anymore conflict. Literally my last option was to hide because you all would not listen when I said I did not want to be in the video the FIRST time. Just cause you give someone food and alcohol and throw in a little sexual intimidation doesn't mean they will buckle. Yet, you still disrespected me as a young women, whom you've known since she was TWELVE. YOU STILL, defied my wishes and in turn showed your lack of respect for a brand that took me fourteen years to build and put me in the video against my wishes. Come on bruh, I clearly said no and you said okay, yet I was being secretly filmed when you told me \"let me just show you the idea\"?? Wow. This is what I'm referring to in my previous post, this is the sexism and misogyny I refer to because if I was a dude, he wouldn't have even tried me like this. Let this be a lesson to all, I'm not for the bullshit. I'm serious about my business and you will not use my likeness without MY permission. When you in front of a boss you treat them like one, like I treat YOU. NO MEANS NO People have to listen to women and stop questioning them and their intelligence. Speak up, cause when you look someone in the face and they say \"I understand. You don't have to feel pressured to do the video\" and they STILL put you in it, it is a violation. It would be great to be able to handle these things privately but why when they aren't respected? \nA photo posted by Laurennnn Palmer (@kekepalmer) on Jan 21, 2017 at 4:54pm PST \n“This is preposterous. How am I in this video Trey? After you found me in a closet HIDING because I was so afraid of anymore conflict,” the 23-year-old Scream Queens actress wrote in a lengthy Instagram post featuring a still from the video. “Literally my last option was to hide because you all would not listen when I said I did not want to be in the video the FIRST time. Just cause you give someone food and alcohol and throw in a little sexual intimidation doesn’t mean they will buckle.” \nPalmer claimed that although the two have known each other for many years, Songz “secretly filmed” her and “ put me in the video against my wishes.” \nIn the video, Palmer makes a short appearance where she takes selfies on her phone while sitting on a couch. However, the music video now appears to have been taken down.\nThe song also names her, when featured artist MIKExANGEL raps, “I palm her p—- like Keke / Like Keke, like Keke.”\nA rep for Palmer had no comment. A rep for Songz did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\nPalmer’s interview on Larry King Now airs Wednesday, Feb. 1 on Ora.tv at 2 p.m. EST/11 a.m. PST.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T04:24:50.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
