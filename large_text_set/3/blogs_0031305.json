Wishing that James Avery was still with us to make this complete. \nA post shared by Alfonso Ribeiro (@therealalfonsoribeiro) on Mar 27, 2017 at 5:27pm PDT \nClassic TV reunions are what we live for, right? Well folks, there’s now been a Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air one.\nPiers Morgan's bolognese recipe took on Mary Berry's on Good Morning Britain - and lost And it’s all thanks to Alfonso Ribeiro, who played Carlton Banks on the show, that we know about the 90s nostalgia fest.\nAlfonso reunited with his former co-stars, including Will Smith, Tatyana Ali, Karyn Parsons, Daphne Maxwell Reid and Joseph Marcell, on Monday.\nPosting a snap of the special occasion on his Instagram page, he wrote: ‘Always amazing to spend an afternoon with my Fresh Prince family.\n‘Wishing that James Avery was still with us to make this complete.’\nWill Smith and James Avery (Picture: Paul Drinkwater/NBCU Photo Bank) James Avery, who played Will’s Uncle Phil, sadly died on New Year’s Day in 2014 .\nIt’s been 21 years since the sitcom, which ran from 1990 to 1996, left our TV screens.\nAnd it’s safe to say that there have been calls for a reunion pretty much ever since Will and co bowed out.\nSmith has previously played down reports of a reunion, telling E! News last year in no uncertain terms: ‘I don’t think ever, like pretty close to when hell freezes over. Like we’re going to leave that one alone.’\nThe Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air aired from 1990 to 1996 (Picture: Allstar Collection/NBC)  \nAnd in 2014, Alfonso said in an interview how the cast are unlikely to reunite to protect Avery’s legacy.\n‘Since the passing of my favorite dad in the world, ever on TV, James Avery passed, the chances of a Fresh Prince coming back together will not happen,’ he said at the time.\n‘I don’t think we feel as a cast that we would do even our fans justice. We all felt like he was the centerpiece or the nucleus of that show. Without him, it just doesn’t work.\n‘So even if the whole cast comes to support me on the show, we’re not looking for that to happen. And that’s OK.’\nMore: TV Over 150 people have complained to Ofcom about the BBC's Red Nose Day show \nLine Of Duty's Vicky McClure won't quit the UK because of sausage rolls \nPrue Leith 'given security after getting threats over Great British Bake Off' \nHowever, Tatyana, who starred as Will’s younger sister Ashley in the comedy, has previously expressed an interest in a reunion episode, saying: ‘I think everyone would be into it [but] it just depends on everyone’s schedule.’\nIf a reunion ever does happen, one person unlikely to return is Janet Hubert, who played Vivian Banks in the NBC show and has been rather vocal about not wanting to ever work with Smith again .\nJames Avery as Philip Banks, Will Smith as William ‘Will’ Smith and Janet Hubert as Vivian Banks (Picture: Chris Haston/NBCU Photo Bank) She told TMZ in 2011: ‘There will never be a reunion as I will never do anything with an a like Will Smith. He is still an egomaniac and has not grown up.\n‘This constant reunion will never ever happen in my lifetime unless there is an apology. He doesn’t know the word.’\nThis isn’t the first time – and it definitely won’t be the last – that the Fresh-Prince crew have reunited, also joining forces in December 2011 for a luncheon . Needless to say, Hubert wasn’t there.\nWhether there is or isn’t a reunion in the future, one thing to get excited about is the rumours that Will Smith and Jazzy Jeff might be playing Glastonbury this year. Now that, we would pay money to see…\n\nMORE: This supercut tribute to Hilary Banks from The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air will make you long for the 90s \nMORE: Ed Sheeran’s cover of The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air theme song is seriously good ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:22:00.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
