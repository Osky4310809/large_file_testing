The 24-day surge to 21,000 matches the fastest-ever such advance in the index’s history, when it rallied from 10,000 to 11,000 in early 1999. ( See the full list of trading sessions between 1,000-point milestones here .) \nYes, milestones are just numbers, but they provide an opportunity to reflect, take stock and consider history. To that end, below is a visual history of the Dow and its important milestones, in one chart. Last updated: March 1, 2017 \nThe 21,000 milestone may have seemed a ways off just days ago, but on Wednesday the Dow surged over 300 points on the heels of President Donald Trump’s first address to Congress. \nAll this came just a day after the Dow failed to hit a different kind of record: On Tuesday, stocks pushed lower , snapping what would have been a record-setting winning streak for the Dow. \nNo matter, though — investor caution going into Trump’s address turned into optimism on Wednesday after his speech was generally well-received and renewed hopes he’ll be able to deliver on campaign promises that include boosting fiscal spending and cutting taxes. \nThe rally from 19,000 to 20,000 was the Dow’s second-fastest 1,000-point advance to a milestone level, since the 59-session span between 13,000 and 14,000 from late March to early July 2007. \nIn the past, the index has struggled with major milestones for years. It first touched 1,000 in 1966 but didn’t close above that mark until November 1972. And the Dow first crossed 10,000 in 1999, but only really took up residence above that milestone in 2010. \nThe Dow saw no such struggle in the run-up to 21,000. The rally that kicked off following Trump’s election last November has only picked up speed since late January, and all this velocity has at least one MarketWatch columnist talking Dow 30,000 in Trump’s first term . \nSome investors and analysts question just how big of a factor Trump policy proposals have been in driving the record-busting rally — attributing rising stock prices more to positive economic conditions and improving earnings numbers. \nMeanwhile, there are some warnings and red flags for those investors looking to curb their own enthusiasm. Many are worried markets could be headed for bubble territory ( though Warren Buffett isn’t one of them ). Then, there’s the increasing possibility of an interest-rate hike from the Fed, ongoing political turmoil in Europe , all of the unknowns surrounding what stance Trump will take on trade, a lack of specifics on many of his coming policies, and the specter of political and legislative hurdles for many of his other proposals.
