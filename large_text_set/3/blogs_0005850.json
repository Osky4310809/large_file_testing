Posted 7 hours ago 3 \nThe rumors about Papa Emeritus firing every member of Ghost have been fueled up with the band's recent acceptance of the Swedish Grammis Award ceremony. \nAs MetalSucks reports, only one Nameless Ghoul was there to accept the Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance award, and seeing that Tobias Forge, aka Papa, previously dressed as Ghouls for interviews (including one conducted by the source), a scenario of Forge accepting the award as a Ghoul doesn't come as too far fetched. \nDuring a recent interview, Forge gave a vague reply on the whole matter, once again only fueling the speculation. \nThe musician told Metal Wani: \"From a practical point of view, you're interested in, on the one hand, preserving the sound, or the elements that make up the sound, and you still wanna progress. I think one of the secrets behind our preserving ability is the fact that we don't necessarily have to have the same six people in the room to make that sound, which helps. \n\"It's always a blessing and a curse when you have some of these classic bands over the course of rock and roll history, where in order for them to sound like that exact band, you need those four individuals, and if one is missing, it does not sound like that. \n\"And, fortunately, we don't have that problem. \n\"Because performing Ghost and recording Ghost has never really been the same thing. So that we can preserve our sound; we don't have to rely on... if some people come and go, which is good. \n\"Queens of the Stone Age is the same thing. Everything goes through Josh's hands, and therefore it sounds like Queens of the Stone Age, regardless of who he brings in and out of the band, which is, I guess, a similar situation.\" \nStay tuned for updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:43:52.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
