IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is here to show us, with this stomach-churning clip from the cockpit of his 220 mile-per-hour race car. The 28-year-old, 24 Hours of Daytona-winning driver posted the video below to Twitter, which features a few speedy solo laps around Phoenix International Raceway with a G-force monitor on the bottom left corner of the screen. Our insides are turning into mush just watching Rahal bend the space-time continuum to his will. \nAccording to the handy G-force monitor, Rahal pushed a maximum of 5.1 Gs around the Arizona oval. Simply put, G-forces represent the force of an object’s acceleration, with 1 G being equal to the force of the Earth’s gravitational pull. For context, the Space Shuttle pulls about 3 Gs on reentry to Earth, while the world’s most extreme roller coaster exerts 6.3 Gs onto occupants. That’s just 1 G less than Rahal’s peak G-force measurement, but don't forget Rahal has to maintain control of his car while the laws of physics are liquefying his internal organs. We really, really hope this is implied, but remember that he’s a professional on a closed course before you conduct your own G-force test on a highway cloverleaf.
