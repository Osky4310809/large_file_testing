It’s the sound of the Rhythm Method, the London duo who are managing to accomplish the hitherto impossible seeming task of making indie music that feels brand new. But where there is innovation, there will be derision, something the makers of this divisively odd sound are all too aware of. “I feel like we’re in for a lot of hate once more people hear us,” says Joey, the band’s 27-year-old frontman. \nIf the fledgling outfit’s current following is anything to go by – Elton John and Suggs are fans, while Mike Skinner produced their latest single – that surge in popularity, and vitriol, could be just around the corner. With their wonkily infectious takes on everything from UK garage and lover’s rock to pop house and new wave, the band are responsible for some of the most distinctive music of the past couple of years. But they are also on a mission: to restore British pop to its former glory. “These days it’s so polarised. You have 6 Music which is so serious, and then you have Radio 1 , which just sounds like a bunch of people having the time of their lives in Ibiza,” Joey’s bandmate Rowan says, explaining the present divide between pop and indie. “We want to have songs that a massive amount of people are singing along to, but we’re never ever being idiotic about it.” ‘Local, Girl sounds very Phoenix Nights, very cheap’ … The Rhythm Method at Albert Hall, Manchester.

I wrote about 25 songs and put them straight on Soundcloud. I think they averaged about seven listens.” Soon afterwards, he moved in with his old friend Rowan, and they began rejigging the results of Joey’s songwriting splurge. “It was like nothing I’d ever heard”, says Rowan. “Like Magnetic Fields done by someone who didn’t really understand anything about music”. \nDespite that naivety, the pair weren’t total amateurs. They first met as teenagers in the 00s indie scene and were both in bands (Rowan’s group, Burmese Days, were once supported by Florence + the Machine ). When that moment passed, they were free to indulge their own, more esoteric tastes. “These are things to amuse ourselves,” says Rowan of the band’s material. Their pub rock song Local, Girl was born when they decided “let’s write a song about pubs. It was all just an in-joke basically,” says Rowan. “And it got played on Radio 1.” \nNot that the band itself are a joke. Although their music is frequently laugh-out-loud – not only in the pun-heavy lyrics, but the sound of the songs themselves (“Local, Girl sounds very Phoenix Nights, very cheap,” says Joey) – their combination of silliness and seriousness aligns them with acts such as Lil Yachty , Grimes and London collective PC Music , for whom irreverence is not at odds with sincerity. “It’s the difference between being funny and being ironic,” explains Rowan. \nIn fact, much of the jarring – even eye-watering – nature of the Rhythm Method’s output comes from the fact they don’t have anything to hide behind, whether it be irony, generic conventions, or a group of like-minded peers. “I feel like people are put off by [our music] because it’s too honest”, reveals Joey. “My lyrics are a bit close to the bone.” \nIt’s true that the band’s songs are almost awkward in their specificity – whether they are referencing Cherie Blair, Wetherspoons or George Best – and the impression is compounded by the vulnerable nature of the sound: Rowan’s offish backing vocals, Joey’s half-spoken lyrics. “I thought if you’re not doing a cockney, mockney accent it would be weird to do it in my neutral lower-middle-class voice,” he says. “But that’s kind of what it’s all about now. That honesty, that suburban boring accent.” \nRhythm Method’s songs gild that suburban mundanity with glimpses of the sublime. Local, Girl imbues the world of slightly depressing boozers with a strange majesty, whereas Home Sweet Home is a paean to a hometown being obliterated through gentrification, injecting everything pedestrian – from yellow lines to Magic FM – with a sense of awe. It’s part of a heritage of sentimental city songs, from Waterloo Sunset to Up the Junction , that evoke an almost unbearable nostalgia for a crappier but happier time. \nJoey’s dad lived in Putney in the 1970s and “filled me with stories. You’d have rock stars and footballers and gangsters all running round with each other and I kind of see the world through those rose-tinted glasses,” he explains. Rowan agrees. “My dad and my uncle were very big Dr Feelgood fans, they would have gone to see Squeeze, and I grew up with that music. We both have this second-hand lineage.” \nThis misty-eyed view of the 70s is something they attribute to growing up in the 90s. “Nothing had actually changed since the 70s and 80s,” Joey says of his childhood. “They were still showing Rising Damp on telly, Only Fools and Horses .” This sense of nostalgia once-removed is something the pair are keen to capture in their music. Their tour driver Mitch once told them it reminded him of “being in a pub as a kid and hearing songs on the radio”, says Rowan. “And I feel like that’s one of the best things ever said about us.” \nMaking music about how much you miss the 70s when you weren’t even there might seem a strange concept, but that doesn’t mean Rhythm Method haven’t got their eyes firmly fixed on the future. “I genuinely want to be the most important slash biggest band of our generation,” says Joey, as they prepare their debut album. “I feel confident about it and I’m not a very confident person. I would know if we were shit, and I don’t think we are.” For now, the pair are playing the long game. “People get won round by it,” says Rowan. “‘I fucking hated you at first, but now I can’t stop listening’ is the reaction we get a lot.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:18:44.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
