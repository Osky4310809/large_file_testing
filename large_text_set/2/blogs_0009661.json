He has been ejected and is currently being arrested by the New York City Police Department. \n“He was a great Knick and we hope he gets some help soon.” [ Archive: Oakley called out Charles Barkley for comments after Cavs-Hawks game ] \nSports writers on the scene reported that Oakley said , “Dolan did this,” among other shouted comments about the owner after being led away by security. Knicks president Phil Jackson attempted to calm down the 53-year-old down, who was yelling , “This is bullish–,” and , “F— that, let me go.” \nOakley, who played for the Knicks from 1988 to 1998 and was selected for the 1994 All-Star Game, became a fan favorite at the Garden while developing a reputation as one of the NBA’s toughest players. However, he has been in something of an exile from the organization, an awkward situation Oakley has blamed on Dolan. \n“The boss don’t like me,” Oakley told the New York Times in October. He went on to say of Dolan, “I mean, I had at least 15 people try to set up a meeting. He won’t meet. I want to sit down to talk to him. I want me and him in a room. And lock the door. Lock that door!” \nOakley added, “I mean, he can have the police outside the door.” \n“As hard as I played for that motherf—–, and he don’t want to talk with me?” Oakley exclaimed about Dolan in 2015 (via the New York Daily News ). “Everybody in New York liked me except this one guy. . . . He’s a bad guy.” SBNY Exclusive: Charles Oakley on the ground surrounded by police and Garden security pic.twitter.com/cemhHF4Lu0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:05:18.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
