Just file a complaint if you want me replaced,” Condoya was quoted as telling Gato. Nation ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nCondoya left the province in May, and told his friends that he was reassigned to the main island of Luzon. \nHe returned after two weeks, left again on June 6, returned in October, then left again after two weeks. He did not open his office during the times he was here. \nGov. Marilou Cayco said she relayed the concern of her province mates to the BIR regional office in July, and was told that they could not find a replacement yet. \nA check at the BIR regional office showed Condoya should have reported for work here starting Jan. 9. \nHowever, nobody has seen him anywhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T10:25:36.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
