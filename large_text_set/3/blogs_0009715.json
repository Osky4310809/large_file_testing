I know there is a lot of hard work ahead and I assure all our fans that I will do all I can to provide a winning and entertaining Rangers team.” \nRangers managing director Stewart Robertsonbelieves Caixinha is the best man for the job and was the most impressive candidate on his shortlist. \n“We are delighted to welcome Pedro to Rangers. We compiled a shortlist of high-quality candidates for the position but we knew after our initial meeting with Pedro that he was the right man to take this club forward,\" he added. \nWho could break Pogba's record? \n“He is a man of great experience and authority and the board has no doubt he will help us achieve our long-term goals. I would like to thank the Rangers supporters for their patience throughout the process but we were determined to appoint the best candidate possible. \n“I would also like to thank Graeme Murty for taking control of the first team. He will complete his duties at Celtic Park on Sunday before returning to his role with the under-20s and Pedro will begin his work on Monday morning.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T19:10:51.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
