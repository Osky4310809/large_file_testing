Allow me to explain. \nThe device has two parts . One is a box-like piece that attaches to your phone and sort of looks like one of those big phone cases that also charges your phone. The other piece is a small chip the size of a microscope slide. Hadi Shafiee/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School \nIn order to test his sperm, your man basically uses a pipette (a small tube) to transfer his semen onto the chip. Then, the chip goes into a slot in the bigger box. \nThe box has lenses that turn your phone’s camera into a microscope, allowing it to get a magnified look at the sample. \nAn app you download along with the device then looks at the image taken by the microscope and counts the total number of sperm, finds their concentration per millimeter and detects their speed and movement. \nThat last part about detecting their speed is pretty key in making the device as accurate as it is. \nYou see, over-the-counter sperm checkers are available right now. But according to Shafiee, they don’t accurately determine a man’s fertility because they only measure concentration, not how quickly or how well the sperm moves. M.K Kanakasabapathy et al, Science Translational Medicine \nResearchers even had untrained users test the device with 350 semen samples, and those users were able to detect abnormal sperm with the device with 98 percent accuracy. \nNPR reports the device is currently only made for Androids, and Shafiee is working on making one that also works for iPhones. \nWhile it’s not yet available in stores, she hopes, one day, it will be easily accessible to everyone: “This device is going to make male infertility screening as simple as home pregnancy tests for a woman.” Surrogate Motherhood: Redefining the Modern Family [INSIGHTS] To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
