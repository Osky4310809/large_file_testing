Let’s not forget about the little guys though. At MWC 2017 Nubia is showing off a new version of the Nubia N1 , a scaled down model dubbed the Nubia N1 Lite.\nThe official press release is honestly a bit vague on the processor, but we do know it offers a quad-core chipset, likely of the MediaTek variety. There’s also 2GB RAM, 16GB storage, a 5.5-inch 720p display, LTE, a 3000 mAh battery, and the main cam is an 8MP shooter with an f/2.0 aperture and dual-LED. Up front is a 5MP shooter with built-in flash. As you can tell, the specs here aren’t exactly exciting, though at least there is still a fingerprint scanner on the back.\nSee also: Best cheap Android phones (February 2017) 6 days ago The software on the N1 Lite will be based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which even for a budget phone is a bit disappointing in 2017. The Nubia N1 Lite will launch in March in Germany, Spain, Italy, and the Czech Republic. It will also be offered in India, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.\nLooking for more great MWC coverage?
