We’re going to keep our citizens safe,” the President said at a rally in Nashville. “The danger is clear. The law is clear. The need for my executive order is clear.” Also Read \nTrump’s new travel ban faces day in court \nThe judge issued his 43-page ruling less than two hours after hearing Hawaii’s request for a temporary restraining order to stop the ban from being put into practice. \nThe ruling came as opponents renewed their legal challenges across the country, asking judges in three states to block the executive order that targets people from six predominantly Muslim countries. Federal courts in Maryland, Washington state and Hawaii heard arguments Wednesday about whether it should be allowed to take effect early Thursday as scheduled. \nIn all, more than half a dozen states are trying to stop the ban. \nJudge Watson made it clear that his decision applied nationwide, ruling that the ban could not be enforced at any U.S. borders or ports of entry or in the issuance of visas. \nNominated to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama in 2012, he is currently the only Native Hawaiian judge serving on the federal bench and the fourth in U.S. history. He received his law degree from Harvard in 1991. \nIn Maryland, attorneys told a federal judge that the measure still discriminates against Muslims.

It doesn’t draw any religious distinctions,” said Jeffrey Wall, who argued for the Justice Department. \nAttorneys for the ACLU and other groups said that Mr. Trump’s statements on the campaign trail and statements from his advisers since he took office make clear that the intent of the ban is to ban Muslims. Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller has said the revised order was designed to have “the same basic policy outcome” as the first. \nThe new version of the ban details more of a national security rationale. It is narrower and eases some concerns about violating the due process rights of travelers. \nIt applies only to new visas from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen and temporarily shuts down the U.S. refugee program. It does not apply to travelers who already have visas. \n“Generally, courts defer on national security to the government,” said U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang. “Do I need to conclude that the national security purpose is a sham and false?” Also Read \nTrump’s command economy \nIn response, ACLU attorney Omar Jadwat pointed to Mr. Miller’s statement and said the government had put out misleading and contradictory information about whether banning travel from six specific countries would make the nation safer. \nThe Maryland lawsuit also argues that it’s against federal law for the Trump administration to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the United States this year by more than half, from 110,000 to 50,000. Attorneys argued that if that aspect of the ban takes effect, 60,000 people would be stranded in war-torn countries with nowhere else to go. \nJudge Chuang made no immediate ruling. \nIn the Hawaii case, the federal government said there was no need to issue an emergency restraining order because Hawaii officials offered only “generalized allegations” of harm. \nJeffrey Wall of the Office of the Solicitor General challenged Hawaii’s claim that the order violates due process rights of Ismail Elshikh as a U.S. citizen who wants his mother-in-law to visit his family from Syria. He says courts have not extended due process rights outside of a spousal relationship. Also Read \nHawaii becomes first state to sue over Trump's new travel ban \nNeal Katyal, a Washington, D.C., attorney representing Hawaii, called the story of Elshiskh, an Egyptian immigrant and naturalised U.S. citizen, “the story of America.” \nIn Washington state, U.S. District Judge James Robart who halted the original ban last month heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, which is making arguments similar to the ACLU’s in the Maryland case. \nJudge Robart said he is most interested in two questions presented by the group’s challenge to the ban- whether the ban violates federal immigration law, and whether the affected immigrants would be “irreparably harmed” should the ban go into effect. \nJudge Robart said he would issue a written order, but he did not say when. He is also overseeing the challenge brought by Washington state. \nAttorney General Bob Ferguson argues that the new order harms residents, universities and businesses, especially tech companies such as Washington state-based Microsoft and Amazon, which rely on foreign workers.
