Rowling just stepped up the game in her online feud with Piers Morgan You might not be aware that J.K. Rowling and Piers Morgan are in the middle of a MASSIVE Twitter feud at the moment, and have been for quite some time.\nThings between Rowling and Morgan became more heated than usual following Morgan‚Äôs appearance on the Real Time with Bill Maher, where Jim Jefferies laid into the rent-a-mouth. Rowling, having seen the clip, shared it to her millions of followers, prompting former-British newspaper editor and friend of President Trump to respond saying he‚Äôd ‚Äúnever read a single word of Harry Potter,‚Äù leading to one book store to start tweeting the professional troll and commentator with lines from The Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone . Awkwardly, Morgan‚Äôs son then got involved , where he showcased his Harry Potter tattoo on Twitter‚Ä¶\nWell this is awkward @piersmorgan @jk_rowling pic.twitter.com/OHhkj8TWlM \n‚Äî Spencer Morgan (@spencermorgan93) February 11, 2017 What‚Äôs more, people were quick to point out that Piers Morgan had, in fact, read the Potter books, as exhibited below.\nMan who claims to have never read a word of Harry Potter quotes liberally from Harry Potter book https://t.co/DhSD0bck9q \n‚Äî Barry Glendenning (@bglendenning) February 11, 2017 Well, on Valentine‚Äôs Day (February 14th), J.K. Rowling laid the perfect Twitter trap for Piers Morgan and he fell right into it. Sharing a screengrab of a flattering description of herself, Rowling tweeted that she wanted to thank whomever had written it. In the text, it notes the writer thanked the author for ‚Äúencouraging children to read, feel inspired, and be creative.‚Äù \n‚ÄúShe has had a greater impact on the world than [many other celebrities],‚Äù it finishes.\nJust been sent this! Could the writer let me know who he is? I'd love to thank him! #Valentines pic.twitter.com/OQtbxPD6AL \n‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 14, 2017 After sharing the picture, Piers Morgan (who must have an alert set up for every time Rowling tweets) quoted the tweet and wrote: ‚ÄúPriceless #humblebrag BS. Nobody plays the celebrity game more abusively or ruthlessly than you, Ms ‚ÄòIntensely Private Billionaire‚Äô.‚Äù \nUnfortunately for Piers, and fortunately for Rowling, people were quick to note that Piers Morgan himself had written the description of Rowling back in March 2010 in a list for the Daily Mail titled ‚Äú100 British celebrities who really matter.‚Äù\nOh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. He doesn't realise.

She's ended Twitter. It's over. It doesn't get better than this.\n‚Äî Aaron Idstein (@titularninja) February 14, 2017 @JamieRoss7 Your Tweet has given everyone I know such joy.

Rowling was an expert at Twitter burns , but this latest one is truly ingenious.
