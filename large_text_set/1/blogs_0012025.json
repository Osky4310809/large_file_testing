There’s no way they will be as defensive as they were that day. \nI don’t think it’s the opposite way around on Sunday, but I think Liverpool will have a mindset whereby they see a point as a minimum requirement. They can’t afford to see United cut the gap on them to two points. \nMourinho will be pragmatic. He’ll know that Liverpool will press high and press hard and he will know that press fades as the game goes on. \nIf they can get through the first hour, he will feel that chances and moments will come in the game and Liverpool will make defensive mistakes.

Will Henderson and Matip be fit? \nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp must make a decision on Jordan Henderson and Joel Matip. \nHenderson has been out since New Year’s Eve while Matip hasn’t played for a month. \nThey have both returned to training and Liverpool could certainly do with them at Old Trafford. \nWe’ll have the latest from Klopp at around 1pm.
