Lucknow shootout: Is Akhilesh Yadav’s ‘vote bank’ politics responsible for ISIS terror? The real concern is not even what happened in UP, the real concern is that it can trigger many such events and in fact, it started today itself when 11 ISIS suspects were reported in Madhya Pradesh. By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 8, 2017 2:04 PM The Samajwadi Party was attacked by other political parties for poor law and order in the state. (Source: PTI) \nNot too long ago, ISIS flag was raised in Kashmir which was the first such incident in India and yesterday, a major encounter involving a member of ISIS module took place right at country’s heart in Uttar Pradesh’s Lucknow. While the attack itself raises a lot of question marks over security arrangements, the fact that it took place one day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s trip to state got over and one before the final phase of voting was scheduled to take place, it is a major concern for all. So, who do we blame for it? Is it the police who failed to keep a check on terrorism or is it the increasing crime rate in the state which has eventually given birth to terrorism in UP. In both cases, Akhilesh Yadav ’s government comes under scrutiny and rightly so. \nThroughout the campaign for this year’s election, the Samajwadi Party was attacked by other political parties for poor law and order in the state but the Chief Minister and his deputies kept denying the fact. What happened in Lucknow on Tuesday only established the fact that SP government’s soft stand on terror has led to a bigger problem. This incident has to do a lot with Akhilesh Yadav’s ‘vote bank’ politics which has forced him not to take any strong stand against Islamic elements in the state. \nThis where the terrorist was hiding in Lucknow’s Thakurganj:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T11:25:13.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
