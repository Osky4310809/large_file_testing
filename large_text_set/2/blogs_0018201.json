Thus far, we‚Äôve debated the collection‚Äôs successes and failures , figured out how you can get Kanye‚Äôs look for less and speculated what vintage sneaker may have inspired Season 5‚Äôs gloriously fugly YEEZY Runner . Now, we set our sights on the clan of youngsters who graced the catwalk (or jumbotron LED screen) in the actual show.\nMeet Bari Diamond , aka ‚ÄúJacuzzi,‚Äù a 20-something creative currently tearing up the Big Apple‚Äôs fashion underworld. If Jacuzzi looks familiar, it might be because you‚Äôve seen him lurking about some smoggy after-hours shindig in East Jesus Nowhere Brooklyn or walking in Hood By Air ‚Äòs SS17 show last fashion week.\nIf you still can‚Äôt pinpoint where you‚Äôve spotted the bald-headed eccentric covered in occult symbol face tattoos, maybe our shoot with buzzy downtown streetwear store Homies Wonderland , where Jacuzzi works as head designer, rings a bell?\nEither way, the emerging fashion star has been causing some commotion in NYC‚Äôs thriving underground community for a minute now, but could his YEEZY modeling gig finally be his big break? As we‚Äôve seen with show veterans Luka Sabbat, Amina Blue and Lil Yachty, a cosign via Kanye can boost one‚Äôs popularity overnight, or at the very least expose them to a wider, more mainstream audience (the follower counts don‚Äôt lie).\nWe caught up with Jacuzzi to find out how he ended up in the show, what it was like working with Kanye and what we can expect from him in 2017. (You‚Äôll have to bear with the answers, they‚Äôre a bit, um, ‚Äúcryptic‚Äù.)\nVibrate.\nThree years on and off.
