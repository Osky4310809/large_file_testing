This University District home was sold in 2014 for $205,000. It’s a very different market now and looking for a new owner with an asking price of $319,900. The house is 3,500 square feet, with six bedrooms, four and a half bathrooms, a breakfast nook, a formal dining room, a finished basement, a sun room, and just a lot of living space. The finished third floor has two of the bedrooms and a bathroom. A lot of original details remain. The kitchen seems a little small, but there are a lot of built-ins downstairs. It’s simply a large move-in ready home in a great neighborhood. The corner lot itself is also huge, with a basketball court and fenced backyard. A few other homes have sold for over $300K in the University District this past year. The new owners might choose to do some cosmetic updates to this one.
