You want to give them one chance, two chances, three chances. \n\"Maybe now, it is too much. Of course I must change something because it is not possible to continue in this way. \n\"We need to work together to find a solution. The machine is not broken, but when you don't play at your maximum level and the others stay at the top, it is a difficult battle. \n\"We stick together and we are training hard. I am very strong, very confident with my players. \n\"I believe in everything and it just takes the right moment to go back. I have all the support of the club, of the fans â€“ everybody.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:28:59.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
