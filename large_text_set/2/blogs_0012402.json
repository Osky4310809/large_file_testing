Weighing 680 kgs at the time of launch, Cartosat-2 is a specialized ‘Earth observation satellite’ in sun-synchronous orbit. This can create high-resolution images at a height of 1 meter, and is all set to benefit South East Asia in determining weather conditions.\n4) Highest number of satellites in this galactic caravan belongs to US, as they have placed 96 satellites, for various objectives. The others are: BGUsat from Israel, Al-Farabi-1 from Kazakhstan, PEASSS from the Netherlands and Nayif-1 from UAE\n5) Out of 96 satellites from US, 88 belong to a San Francisco based space company called Planet Inc. These are small satellites, called as Doves, and weigh only 4.7 kgs. These are infact Triple-CubeSat miniature satellites , and they will help scientists to gather crucial information related to climate monitoring, crop yield prediction, urban planning, and disaster response.\nThe previous record for launching maximum number of satellites belong to Russian Space Agency, when they had placed 37 satellites in one single go in 2014. If we talk about ISRO, then in June 2015, they had launched maximum of 23 satellites in one single go.\nWe had earlier reported that ISRO will now launch a mission for Venus , which would be India’s first; and a second mission to Mars, for which, NASA is keen on partnering with India.\nIndia’s space saga has certainly climbed into a new dimension with this world record breaking feat of launching 104 satellites in one single go.\nThe Complete Launch Video \n\nSources: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \nCheck These Related Articles!
