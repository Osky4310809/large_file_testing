Hot on the heels of an unauthorized TV movie chronicling her life, Britney Spears has taken to Instagram sharing a sexy topless photo, which shows there’s only one Britney -- and she looks fabulous! A post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Feb 19, 2017 at 1:53pm PST The photo was posted on Sunday, shortly after the singer’s ups and downs were reenacted by Australian actress Natasha Bassett in Lifetime’s Britney Ever After biopic. The movie was a hot topic on social media, with many slamming the two-hour film. “Lifetime did a terrible job with the movie,” a fan commented on her sultry shot. Many celebs were also appalled by the biopic, tweeting their thoughts as they watched. “Oh my god - this Britney Spears lifetime movie thing is horrific,” tweeted singer Darren Hayes. “I think the dialogue is all (badly) improvised,” YouTube star Tyler Oakley was meanwhile “gasping” in shock at the movie. “This ain't right y'all, she does NOT deserve THIS!!” he tweeted.
