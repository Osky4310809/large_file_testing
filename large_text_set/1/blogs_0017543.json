Plus, she’s been playing up the wavy-haired look with braids and a top knot. \nDisha Patani \nIf we had hair as beautiful as Disha’s, we too would love to play around with voluminous hairstyles like she does. \nKarisma Kapoor \nKarisma is also a fan of the ponytail, like Alia. But she prefers a higher, more face-framing style instead. \nSwara Bhaskar \nSwara seems to be a fan of keeping her hair away from her face (a feeling we’re totally familiar with), rocking variations of an updo at her recent appearances. \nSonam Kapoor \nSonam’s loose waves are the stuff dreams are made of! \nParineeti Chopra \nParineeti has been playing around with her new short do, sporting waves, curls, and poker straight styles.
