Mark Thompson/Getty Images Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate the ones we love (mainly by giving them tacky presents and a cheap card). However, not all relationships can last forever. In football, while followers remain loyal to their club throughout the good times and the bad, players tend to come and go. While you try not to get too attached along the way, it's impossible not to hold a torch for certain individuals. Right now, Liverpool fans have fallen head over heels for Sadio Mane. Signed from Southampton , the Senegal international caught the eye in the first half of the season. But when Mane was away to represent his country at the Africa Cup of Nations in January, those back on Merseyside longed for his return. There was a feeling of relief on Saturday as the forward marked his first start for Liverpool in 2017 by scoring both goals in the 2-0 triumph over Tottenham Hotspur . Mane is the latest flame for Liverpool fans, but what about those who are no longer around? To mark Saint Valentine's special day, Bleacher Report has picked out five overseas recruits who captured the hearts of the Anfield faithful before moving on. Please note: Only signings made in the Premier League were considered for this list. Honourable Mentions 2 of 7 Sami Hyypia made 464 appearances for Liverpool after joining from Willem II. Alex Livesey/Getty Images Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" includes the oft-quoted lines: \"'Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.\" Liverpool have loved plenty of players from overseas during the Premier League years, that's for sure. Sami Hyypia spent a decade at Anfield, making 464 appearances and winning the treble (FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup) in the 2000/01 season. The Finn also won the Champions League and, such was his strong feeling towards the club, he broke down in tears at the end of his final appearance in red in May 2009. John Arne Riise could easily have cracked the top five, too. Famed for his thunderous shot, the Norwegian scored 31 goals in 348 games for Liverpool. Riise often played in front of goalkeeper Pepe Reina, who displaced Jerzy Dudek—one of the heroes from the miracle of Istanbul in 2005—between the sticks. Dietmar Hamann and Javier Mascherano were outstanding recruits as well, although both had already experienced English football (albeit briefly in the latter's case) with Newcastle United and West Ham United , respectively. There are many others who made a mark: Daniel Agger, Alvaro Arbeloa, Markus Babbel, Milan Baros, Patrik Berger and Mohamed Sissoko. And what about some of the more fleeting romances in recent years? Titi Camara became a cult figure in his one full season with Liverpool, while Maxi Rodriguez worked under three managers — and gained one of the catchiest chants going — during his spell in England. Just to add, current players were not included. While Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Mane are revered, their Liverpool stories are far from over. Xabi Alonso 3 of 7 The thought of a Steven Gerrard-Xabi Alonso midfield combination is enough to make Liverpool fans go weak at the knees. Ian Walton/Getty Images Xabi Alonso's name should bring back bittersweet memories for Liverpool fans. The midfielder, who arrived from Real Sociedad in the summer of 2004 for a fee of £13.6 million, quickly won supporters' hearts with his performances. However, his exit is tinged with sadness, along with questions of what might have been. Comedian Jasper Carrott once joked: \"I hear Glenn Hoddle has found God, that must have been a hell of a pass.\" The same applies to Alonso, who was so elegant on the ball yet also willing to do the dirty work. Alonso played a key part in Liverpool's famous Champions League triumph over AC Milan in 2005, scoring the second goal during the astonishing second-half comeback from 3-0 down. Steven Gerrard wrote in his autobiography (h/t Daily Mail ) how he loved having the Spaniard as a team-mate: \"He was, by some distance, the best central midfielder I ever played alongside.\" As well as talking about their football bromance, Gerrard also claimed the Reds made a \"disastrous decision\" in allowing Alonso to leave in 2009. Manager Rafael Benitez appeared to briefly lose his touch in the summer of 2008, as he inexplicably believed Liverpool needed to buy Aston Villa 's Gareth Barry to pull the strings instead, per the Guardian . Alonso stuck around for one more season, helping the Reds push Manchester United hard for the league title. However, after 210 games and 19 goals (two of them from inside his own half), he eventually joined Real Madrid . The English club made a healthy profit on the player, but the sale left a sizeable void. Like a broken-hearted lover, supporters were left to reminisce about that special someone they'd let slip through their fingers. Forget about a reunion, too, Alonso has confirmed he will retire this summer. Luis Garcia 4 of 7 Did Luis Garcia's shot cross the line against Chelsea? Of course it did. Boris Streubel/Getty Images Luis Garcia will forever be linked with two things when it comes to Liverpool; drinking sangria and scoring a monumental goal against Chelsea . Part of the \"Spanish Armada\" (the \"Rafalution\") that arrived at Anfield in the summer of 2004, manager Benitez knew about Garcia from his time in charge of CD Tenerife . A forward who found a home on the wing, he wrote his name into Anfield folklore with some huge contributions in the club's run to Champions League glory in the 2004/05 season. From an aesthetic point of view, his wonder striker in the quarter-final tie against Juventus was surely the pick of his goals during his time in England. However, in terms of importance, nothing matches his second-leg strike in a closely fought semi-final with domestic rivals Chelsea. Reacting quickly after visiting goalkeeper Petr Cech had flattened Milan Baros, Garcia's scuffed left-footed effort from close range deflected off the diving John Terry and, without a shadow of doubt, crossed the line before Claude Makelele hacked the ball away. Dubbed a \" ghost goal \" by then-Blues boss Jose Mourinho, the controversial strike sent Liverpool through to face AC Milan (and we all know what happened on that night in Istanbul). Garcia scored 30 times in 121 appearances for the Reds before departing for Atletico Madrid in 2007. Despite playing for a host of clubs during his career, Liverpool still holds a special place in his heart. He told the club's official website : \"The three years I spent here and what happened after that with all the people supporting me from far away made me love the club.\" Dirk Kuyt 5 of 7 Dirk Kuyt wheels away to celebrate after scoring against Manchester United. AFP/Getty Images It's not often being sworn at leads to a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, but that's exactly what happened to Dirk Kuyt when he turned out against Manchester United in 2016. While he was playing for Feyenoord in a Europa League fixture at Old Trafford, the home fans refused to allow the forward to forget his deep-rooted connection to one of their rivals. \"60,000 supporters shouted against me, and said you scouse b", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:32:16.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
