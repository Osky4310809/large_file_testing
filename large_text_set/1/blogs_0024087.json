By Wesley Yin-Poole Published 30/01/2017 \nResident Evil 7 is off to a solid sales start in the UK, hitting top spot in this week's chart. \nThe horror game is the third-best week one debut for the Resident Evil series in the UK. The week one record is held by Resident Evil 5, which launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2009. Resident Evil 7 launched on PC, PS4 and Xbox One (the PS4 version works with PSVR). \nFor some reason, UK numbers company Chart-Track failed to mention the second-best week one debut for Resident Evil. Presumably it's 2012's Resident Evil 6. \nChart-Track did say, however, that Resident Evil is Capcom's most successful brand in the UK, based on overall physical revenue since 1995 and up to 2016. It sits just outside the top 30 of all-time brands since arrival in 1996, with around the same revenue as Sony's Crash Bandicoot series and Ubisoft's Just Dance franchise. \nAs always, Chart-Track's data does not include download sales. According to SteamSpy , Resident Evil 7 has sold just over 200,000 copies on Steam, which isn't bad. \nMeanwhile, Square Enix's Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter enters the chart in third place. Sega's Yakuza 0 is in at eight. Bandai Namco's Tales of Berseria debuts at 14. \nOn the hardware front, Chart-Track said the 500GB Glacier White Edition PS4, which came out last week, accounted for around a quarter of all PS4s sold. \nHere's this week's top 10: Resident Evil 7 Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter FIFA 17 Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Rocket League", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T12:33:40.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
