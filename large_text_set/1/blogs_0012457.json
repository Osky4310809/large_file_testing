While existing owners will still get to charge up for free, anyone who orders a Tesla after January 15th would get around 1,000 miles worth of charging credit each year then pay for anything beyond that. \nBut how much would they pay, exactly? \nTurns out there’s not any single answer to that question — due to variations in regulations around the world, the pricing varies a bit depending on where you are. \nTesla started outlining how it works in a blog post tonight: In most of the world, Tesla owners will pay per kWh — that is, you’ll be charged for the actual amount of electricity you receive. In select places, however, Tesla will be required (by local regulations) to charge per-minute at the charging station. It’s a bit less accurate, but Tesla says they going to work with regulators in these regions. In North America, you’ll pay the same price to charge up throughout any given state or province. Outside of North America, pricing is set on a country-by-country basis. \nSo pricing will vary a bit depending on where you are — but within a state’s lines, at least, you know you’ll be paying the same amount at any given supercharger. Beyond that, Tesla says they’re doing this just to help cover costs of Supercharger expansion, and that it’ll “never be a profit center” for the company. \nSince most people think in MPG as opposed to kWh, Tesla broke things down by how much it would cost to use Superchargers for a handful of treks people might be familiar with. According to Tesla: San Francisco to Los Angeles would cost about $15 Los Angeles to New York would cost about $120 Paris to Rome would cost about €60 (or ~$64) Beijing to Shanghai would cost about ¥400 (or ~$60) \nAnd remember: this is only for charging at one of Tesla’s Superchargers (as opposed to charging the car at home, on your own electric bill) and only after the owner has used up their 400 kWh of annual charging credits. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:19:20.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
