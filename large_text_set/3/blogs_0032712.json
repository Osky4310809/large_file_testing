She had reached a whopping 50 pounds after being fed human snacks and been given no exercise. \nThe seven-year-old Spaniel was so overweight a single step would leave her struggling for breath and needing to sit down. \nLast year, Brittney Wilk of the Cavalier Rescue of Alabama rescued Abby, and immediately put her on a strict diet and an underwater treadmill, six times a week, until she was fit enough to go for walks. \nAfter lots of effort, Abby was able to walk and swim all on her own. I love the short clip included in the video below that shows Abby being cheered on in the pool. \nThe sweet dog now weighs a wonderful (and appropriate) 22 pounds and has a new home with a loving family. \nWatch Abby’s amazing transformation in the video below! \nCurious about how to tell if a pet is overweight?
