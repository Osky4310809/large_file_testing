Lionel Luthor brings home a young Lena to live with them. Lex introduces himself and asks if Lena wants to play chess. \nIn the present day, Kara watches a news report about Lillian Luthor's trial at the unnamed alien bars. She has a brief awkward conversation with Mon-El before returning to a table with her friends. Winn and Jimmy speculate about Alex's new \"man\", before Alex arrives with Maggie. Both Winn and Jimmy are surprised, but J'onn knew because he's psychic. Maggie challenges Winn to a game of pool, and Kara mentions that she should see Lena to see how she's doing. \nSure enough, Kara visits Lena to see how she's doing. Lena says that Lillian wants to see her, but she doesn't want to go. Kara says Lena should talk to her mother and tell her how she really feels. After all, her parents are alive (and Kara's aren't). \nLena visits Lillian in prison. Although Lillian is nasty to Lena at first, she apologizes and says that she loves you. Lillian says that all she did was try to protect Lena from Lionel, Lex's father. Lillian reveals that Lionel was Lena's true father, and that Lena was the result of an affair. Lillian says that Lena is a Luthor after all and asks for a second chance. \nIn another part of the prison, James Corbin (aka Metallo) gets a mail call. He opens up the envelope and finds kryptonite inside. \nThe next day, Corbin testifies \"against\" Lillian. He goes on a rant against aliens and says that Lillian is the only person trying to save the planet. When the prosecutor tries to declare Corbin a hostile witness, Corbin stands up and blasts her with a kryptonite ray from his chest. As Corbin goes on a rampage, he frees Lillian and flees the courtroom. Kara goes after her as Supergirl , but Corbin drops a crane on some bystanders. Supergirl saves the bystanders and lets Corbin and Lillian get away. \nBack at the DEO, Maggie gets a call from the prison saying that Metallo must have gotten the kryptonite the previous night. The only problem is that there was only one person who visited the prison: Lena Luthor. \nKara goes to see Lena again and asks if she had anything to do with Metallo's escape. Lena is a bit put off, but then Maggie arrives with video evidence that Lena had kryptonite in her possession. Maggie arrests Lena for aiding and abetting with her mother's escape. \nBack at CatCo, Snapper and Jimmy decide to put Lena on the cover of their magazine. Kara protests, saying that it will ruin Lena's reputation, but Jimmy overrules her and says to run the story. Jimmy says that Lena IS guilty and says he'll prove it to Kara. Afterwards, Kara runs into Jimmy's assistant Eve, only to find out that her date with Mon-El went terribly...because he wouldn't stop talking about Kara. \nMetallo tries to bust Lena out of prison, but Guardian shows up to stop him. Guardian puts up a good fight, but Metallo takes him out. He doesn't kill Guardian though, as his kryptonite heart starts to fade and ebb. Instead, Metallo frees Lena and leaves. \nJimmy gets patched up at the DEO and says that something isn't right with Metallo. Alex says that the DEO needs to treat Lena as if she's guilty. Kara still believes in Lena, but Jimmy points out that Clark and Lex were best friends. He also says that it's frustrating that Kara trusts Lena, but not him. \nKara takes out her frustration on some concrete blocks, when Mon-El shows up. Unlike Jimmy, Mon-El points out that Kara believes in a lot of people that no one else would, himself included. Kara then apologizes to Mon-El for being distant and says she was mad that Mon-El was dating Eve. Mon-El asks why Kara would be mad, but Kara gets flustered and leaves. \nLena tells her mother that no one will believe that she's innocent now that she's been busted out of prison. Lillian says that the public will never believe she's innocent anyways, and then asks Lena to join Cadmus. Meanwhile, Metallo's veins start to glow green, but no one notices. \nLillian takes Lena to one of Lex's old facilities, which contains some of Lex's arsenal. The arsenal is biometrically locked, and Lillian needs Lena's DNA to open it. Lena refuses, but Cyborg Superman forces her to put her hand on it. The arsenal opens up and reveals...one of Lex's warsuits. \nBack at the DEO, Winn discovers that Hank Henshaw hacked into LexCorp and modified the video to frame Lena. Winn also traces Metallo's kryptonite signature into the mountains. Winn points out that Metallo's kryptonite is unstable and that he could blow up at any moment. As Kara flies out to rescue Lena, Alex warns her that when Metallo blows up, it will release a giant poison cloud of kryptonite. \nSupergirl shows up at the Luthor facility, but she's quickly overpowered by some of Lex's sonic weapons. As Supergirl fights back, Winn warns Supergirl that the more Metallo uses his powers, the quicker he'll explode. Cyborg Superman and Lillian flee (but not before Cyborg Superman knocks out Lena) as Metallo begins to go critical. Martian Manhunter shows up to help Supergirl fight and pulls Metallo away. Supergirl and Martian Manhunter grab Lena and fly away just as Metallo explodes. \nThe next morning, Kara triumphantly walks into CatCo and gloats to Snapper about being right. Jimmy asks about Lillian, but Kara says that she and Cyborg Superman got away. Jimmy apologizes too, and Kara says they should go back to being friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:31:42.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
