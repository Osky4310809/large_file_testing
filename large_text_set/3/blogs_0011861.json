The airline will partner with Uber to offer its guests greater choice by facilitating their travel to/from the airport once they have booked a ticket on the Jet Airways app. This path-breaking initiative from the airline will help guests by offering a seamless solution from doorstep to doorstep, with the benefit of two leading players in the travel space – Jet Airways and Uber. Guests booking their flights on the app and using Uber for the first time will also benefit from a discount of Rs. 150 across their first three rides by using the promo code JETUBER. \nYesterday, Uber announced that it is rolling out a ‘real-time ID check’ feature to ensure the driver using the app matches the account registered with the ride-hailing platform. The feature is being launched in five cities in India –Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata and more locations will follow, Uber said in a blog post. With the new feature, drivers will be asked periodically to take a selfie in the Uber app before they accept rides. Then using Microsoft ’s Cognitive Services, the selfie is compared to the one corresponding to the account on file. If the two photos do not match, the account is temporarily blocked while Uber looks into the matter. \nYou may also like to watch: \nIn India, Uber has 4 lakh driver partners registered on its platform and operates in 29 cities. “In India, as of now, we have seen some isolated incidents where riders have reported a mismatch and more often than not it was a case of human error at the driver partner’s end (where drivers sharing a vehicle missed logging out of the app, etc),” the company said. Through this proactive feature, Uber wants to ensure such incidents are pre-empted and thereby, avoided completely. \nThe feature is also being rolled out in other markets like South Africa, Egypt, Russia, Bahrain, the UAE, Qatar, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam.
