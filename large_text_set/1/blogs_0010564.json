She checks her online footprint four times a year, for that reason, and this one just scared her to death because it listed my children as possible associates for her.” \nBrittain, a YA writer, says that almost all of the information on her record card was correct. It even listed her step-father’s ex-wife as her possible associate. On her mother’s page, a young man who briefly stayed with the family for a few weeks during Brittain’s sister’s high school years was listed. \nThe results were even scarier for Alyssa Keele of Washington. \nKeele tells PEOPLE that someone she has a restraining order against was linked to her records. \n“The restraining order I have is against one of the ‘known associates’ that pops up on my profile, who is someone that’s highly dangerous,” she says. “My current address popped up on there and I was legitimately scared.” \nShe says she saw Brittain’s instructions and was able to opt out, but noted, “They don’t make it easy to hide your information.” \nFamilyTreeNow.com and the man listed on LinkedIn as the site’s founder did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s requests for comment. The Washington Post similarly was unable to immediately get in touch with a representative of the site. \nWhile opting out of FamilyTreeNow.com is fairly easy to do, Brittain notes – and many of the people who responded to her Twitter posts also point out – that there are numerous other similar sites that collect information of public record. \nProminent ones include Spokeo , PeekYou , BeenVerified and Whitepages . These websites do simple searches for free, but for information like full telephone numbers and addresses, payments and accounts are required. \nSome, like FamilyTreeNow.com, have opt out options – many of which were compiled by journalist Julia Angwin, on her website , as highlighted by the Post . There’s also a helpful opt out list instruction available on Reddit . \nBrittain also points to Crash Override Network as a resource for anyone dealing with online abuse – which is often aided by information accessible on database sites. \nSays Brittain, “Internet literacy is something you have to learn that they don’t really teach you at school.” \nHere is how to opt out of FamilyTreeNow.com:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T01:23:38.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
