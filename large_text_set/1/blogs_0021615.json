Developer Nordeus has just announced plans to release the card-based fantasy game for Android and iOS later in 2017.\nSee also: Best strategy games for Android April 21, 2016 Nordeus is an experienced mobile developer who have previously released the popular pro soccer/football management game Top Eleven . The team has been working on Spellsouls for the past two years. The goal is to offer players a way to experience intense card and strategy gameplay in brief chucks of three-minute battles.\nThe game itself has the player choosing which of three Spellcasters he or she wants to play, each of which has their own gameplay style. They can then collect the spells they want to use to build up their card decks, and also upgrade their abilities. Then the battles begin in fierce 1v1 matches, as players combine using their spells on their opponent while also controlling their minions in real-time strategy gameplay. Those minions are launched from the top and bottom lane portals on the battle map.\nThe trailers for Spellsouls make the game look very impressive, with some nice graphics, art design and animation. The developers state they wanted to create a MOBA-style game for a mobile device that would be just as fun to play as a MOBA title on the more familiar PC platform.\nThere’s no word yet on pricing for Spellsouls, but it would be surprising if this was not a free-to-play game with in-app purchases. Nordeus has already soft-launched the game for iOS in a few countries, but plans to launch the title worldwide for both iOS and Android sometime later in 2017. In the meantime, you can pre-register your interest in the game on its official website so you can get an email when it officially goes live.\nWhat are your initial impressions of Spellsouls: Duel of Legends?
