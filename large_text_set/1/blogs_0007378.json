It's kind of a stretch considering the pair seemed to be just sitting there and listening… like everyone else in the audience. \nObviously, the theory bemused republicans lik e man baby conservative pundit Tucker Carlson , who cited it as an example of how not everyone is impressed with the so-called Hollywood liberal elite. \nTucker ranted to Fox News : \n\"Here you have a rich and entitled person describing herself as an outsider, an outcast. Look, she doesn't like Trump, that's totally fine, lots of people don't. You're allowed to feel that way, but what I was so struck by is she was telling a crowd exactly what they wanted to hear. She was saying things that are totally uncontroversial within the context she was speaking. That's the least courageous thing you can do.\" \nEither way, the internet had A LOT of feelings… take a look at some of the reactions (below)!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:32:39.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
