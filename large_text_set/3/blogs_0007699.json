Sharmila has got support from the Left Democratic Front (LDF) comprising six parties including CPI, CPIM, JDU and AAP. \n\"We have lost a battle in the long war, but we have started the fire, initiated a movement which will continue. Thanks all for the support,\" PRJA said on Twitter. \nThe Meira Paibis (women activists) who had been Sharmila's backbone during her agitation against the 'draconian' Armed Forces Special Powers Act went against her once she announced entry into politics. \nEven during campaigning, Sharmila looked alone with a bicycle and a whistle (party's symbol). \nWatch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T09:17:48.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
