It never ceases to amaze me that actors take the time and effort to perform my words. When I think about it it's bonkers. What’s been your biggest setback as a writer? I can’t think of one! I didn't make it into the BBC Writers Room a few years ago but I don't think I was ready. Setbacks are to be expected I think it's important to just keep going. And the hardest lesson you’ve had to learn? Self-care, rest, moderation… How to nurture myself as a writer. What do you think is the best thing about theatre? And the worst? Play Talk: Kirsten Childs on writing a musical about an outsider The best thing about theatre is that it's live, it's in the moment and it's about as close to life as you can get without being in it. When it's at its best it's so exciting. The worst thing about theatre is the middle-class stuffy attitude that goes with it. I sometimes get the feeling people like to watch plays about disadvantaged people struggling but don't always welcome it in the real-life audience. I took my son to the theatre once and when he called his cousin sat next to him a 'waste-man' the man on the other side tutted and said my son's behaviour was disgusting. I have written a lot of plays for fringe theatres and all my mates used to come and watch in a right rabble, munching on their pop-corn, drinking coke. It was such a lovely inclusive atmosphere. What’s your best piece of advice for writers who are starting out? Keep writing, just keep writing and give yourself permission to write absolutely shit. Write and write and write and write and only then go back and edit it. Have fun, play with it and don't take heed of the vicious inner critic. Are there any themes and stories you find yourself re-visiting with your plays? Yes. Loss. A lot. And sexuality. Feminist issues. And finding forgiveness.

February 14, British Museum; britishmuseum.org Are you on Twitter? Do you find it a help or a hindrance as a writer? No I'm not. I'm a bit stuck in the stone age. I only got my first proper tele for Christmas and still haven't switched it on. My son is not impressed... Why did you write Glory Whispers? Because I felt I had to. I think I needed to make sense in some way of all the loss and pain I had experienced in my addiction but I also think that this need to write was compounded by the way addicts and homeless people and the disadvantaged are often misrepresented in theatre. I feel like real voices need to speak out, write and tell things a bit more as it is. How do you spend opening night?
