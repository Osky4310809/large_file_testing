Gold’s good.”\nAs the father and daughter sip on their beverages awaiting Jennifer’s entry, Sugar Bear sings his fiancée’s praises with the hope that Alana will come to love her just as much as he does.\n“I’m pretty excited for you to finally get to meet Jennifer and I love her and all that,” he tells Alana, who asks what she should expect of her new stepmother. “I mean, she’s gorgeous. She’s fun — she likes to have fun. She’s a real sweet person. I’ll let y’all meet to see how it goes. Might like her.”\nIn Sugar Bear’s mind, he believes that the two are “going to be best friends” — but Alana’s not so sure.\n“But what if I don’t?” Alana asks him.\nSugar Bear’s advice: “You just have to take it one day at a time.”\nAnd enter Jennifer! Well, sort of. Although viewers only saw her feet and the back right side of her shoulder as she entered the restaurant and approached the table, she still made quite the memorable first impression.\n“Hi Alana!” Jennifer says as Alana smiles and replies “hey” to her. “I’m going to be your new stepmom.” \nThough Mama June wasn’t there to hear this, Alana is pretty sure she’s going to be really upset if she finds out about Jennifer’s new title.\n“When mama hears I met Jennifer, she’s going to lose it,” Alana says, also providing a solution: “So I’m not going to tell her.” Alana may intend to keep those lips tightly sealed, but we have a feeling Mama June is still going to find out.\nMama June: From Not to Hot airs Fridays (10 p.m. ET) on WEtv.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T10:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T05:54:48.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
