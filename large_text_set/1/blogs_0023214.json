Since Flint was outed as being responsible for poisoning its own residents, another 3000 communities have been discovered to have lead levels in their water, higher than Flint’s. But while government continues to scratch its head, twiddle its thumbs, and search for a solution to the crisis, several high-profile hip-hop artists and rappers are taking action to help the people of Flint. \nThe artist known as “The Game” donated 500 thousand dollars to Avita Water, which matched the artists’ donation, in order to provide 1 million dollars’ worth of bottled water to Flint’s residents. After stating his motivation for helping is partly due to the fact that his younger sister’s family lives in Flint, and pointing to the fact that Flint’s affected residents have to use 9 bottles of water daily to drink, wash, and cook, The Game called out other celebrities. “Stop using others tragedies for your won celebrity gain…You’re not fooling ANYONE!” he reportedly said. “I seen Madonna and Jimmy Fallon’s $10,000 donations…that’s cute, but not nearly enough.” \nAccording to one source , The Game is joined by several high-profile artists; \nDiddy and his AQUAhydrate business partner, actor Mark Wahlberg , have pledged to donate one million bottles of water to local residents affected by the poisoned water infiltrating the city. They both have a large stake in the bottled water company. AQUAhydrate reps promised to send 5,000 cases of water to Flint and plan to continue providing additional cases of water to residents until the crisis has been resolved. “The AQUAhydrate team is doing everything it can to help with this issue,” Diddy said. “Mark and I made an initial pledge to donate and are committed to the continued aid to Flint residents as long as they need it. We hope this commitment will inspire others to get involved as well.” Joining them with the cause are Eminem and Wiz Khalifa . \nRapper Big Sean donated 10,000 dollars, and started a fundraising page known as Crowdrise to help others raise needed water funds for Flint. “I’m raising money to support the kids of Flint Michigan,” he stated. “Toxic water in Flint has rendered the water undrinkable and put the entire city in a state of emergency. Flint’s children were hit the hardest and some have experienced permanent and potentially devastating health defects from lead poisoning.” READ MORE: Mainstream Media and Government Remain Silent as Activists From All Over the US Deliver Aid to Flint \nArtist Meek Hill donated 60,000 bottles of water, DJ Mustard donated 10,000 dollars, and Pusha donated 2,000 cases of water. Several other artists have taken action of a different kind, they’ve volunteered their time to meet the residents of Flint where they are, by spending time talking with folks and distributing water. Russell Simmons and Jon Connor have reportedly spent time passing out water and hanging with kids at the local boys and girls clubs in Flint. Other artists have made it a habit of mentioning Flint in their songs and raps — so that no one forgets the ongoing health crisis taking place. \nRussell Simmons and Jon Connor have reportedly spent time passing out water and hanging with kids at the local boys and girls clubs in Flint. Other artists have made it a habit of mentioning Flint in their songs and raps — so that no one forgets the ongoing health crisis taking place. \nFlint’s water supply became poisoned with lead when city officials attempted to save money by switching to the Flint River as the source for its water. The untreated Flint River corroded the city’s piping system, exposing its residents to unsafe levels of lead. While residents were first told their water was unsafe to drink and should be boiled, little did they know more serious poisons were also in their water. \nWhile residents were first told their water was unsafe to drink and should be boiled, little did they know more serious poisons were also in their water. Lead had poisoned the supply, leading to birth defects in babies, developmental disorders and learning disabilities in youth, and painful skin conditions in others. All along, the government has done very little to resolve the health crisis. Flint’s water supply is still unsafe to drink, causing its residents to depend on bottled water for all their water needs.

Flint city and county officials were in a hurry to separate from the Detroit system (Detroit having some of the best water in the country) despite the Lake Huron pipeline not being finished. They resented having to pay the Detroit Water System for clean, already treated drinking water These self-serving DEMOCRAT politicians chose to draw water from the Flint River, thereby endangering its residents. The Flint River has been polluted for generations from industrial processes and is unsuitable for drinking water. In addition, DEMOCRAT city officials REFUSED to allocate $50.00 per day for anti-leaching chemicals, which would have prevented lead from leaching out of the existing water pipes. They are too busy blaming REPUBLICANS for their own failures… It is DEMOCRAT politicians who are responsible for the whole Flint Water fiasco… Social", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T19:12:06.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
