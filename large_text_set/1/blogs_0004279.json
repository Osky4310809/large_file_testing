You could easily interpret that as saying those who fight against freedom of religion are going against what the Founders specifically talked about in the First Amendment. \nNot Fischer. He assumed “religion and morality” were only referring to Christianity, Establishment Clause be damned. \nWashington’s point, Fischer insisted, was that only “sincerely devoted followers of Jesus Christ” can be considered to be patriots , while those who criticize or oppose Christianity or seek to curtail its influence upon society are nothing but “traitors.” \n“I have no hesitation in saying that today,” Fischer said. “You want to find a traitor to your country, find somebody who is actively working to oppose Christianity and oppose the public acknowledgement of the Ten Commandments; you are looking, my friend, right there at an American traitor.” \nIt’s one of those Religious Right talking points that never made any sense. As if people fighting to protect the Constitution are working against America. \nMuslims, Jews, atheists — Christians who don’t think the way Fischer does — we’re all traitors in his mind. \nYou would think if the Founding Fathers wanted to create a theocracy, they would’ve been a little more explicit about it. It was very subversive of them to write all that stuff about not having a religious test for public office or an establishment of religion when they clearly meant that only Christians mattered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T18:09:22.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
