CREDIT: AP Photo/Eric Risberg The Golden State Warriors have hired former San Francisco police Chief Greg Suhr as a security adviser for the team, according to a Wednesday report by NBC Bay Area .\nSuhr resigned from the San Francisco Police Department last May at the request of San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee after police in his district fatally shot an unarmed black woman. But San Francisco residents had been clamoring for him to step down for over a year prior.\nUnder Suhr’s purview, the SFPD was mired in accusations of racial profiling and police brutality.\nThe death of Mario Woods was among the most high-profile scandals under Suhr’s watch. Video of police shooting Woods over a dozen times as he walked away from five officers went viral last year, and Beyonce held up a sign that read “Justice for Mario Woods” during her Super Bowl performance. But Woods was far from alone; the fatal police shootings of Alex Nieto, Amilcar Perez-Lopez, and Kenneth Harding also caused outrage in the community.\nAfter Beyonce’s Super Bowl Statement, Activists Draw 3 More SFPD Victims Out Of The Shadows \nAdditionally, there was a scandal involving the exchange of racist and homophobic text messages sent between five officers, in which they talked about racial profiling and killing black people using very explicit language.\nNonetheless, the Golden State Warriors management said that Suhr is eminently qualified to provide security support.\n“Chief Suhr is an expert on public safety, security issues, event planning and operations, VIP protection, risk assessment and other matters related to the safe and secure operation of a major public venue,” the team said in a statement to NBC Bay Area .\nMany members of the Warriors have been outspoken against racial profiling and police brutality in the past. Team member Andre Iguadala told USA Today last October that police were held to different standards , and that even though he was an NBA star, he still experienced racism. Last year, during the playoffs, Ayesha Curry — wife of two-time MVP Steph Curry — said police working security at Quicken Loans Arena in Ohio during a Warriors game against the Cleveland Cavaliers had racially profiled her father and attempted to arrest him.\n“They kind of profiled my father-in-law and thought he was him. They threatened to arrest him before they checked out his credentials,” Steph said at the time. “It’s kind of been an emotional and tough night all the way around.”\nWarriors hire disgraced former San Francisco Police Chief as security adviser was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:14:13.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
