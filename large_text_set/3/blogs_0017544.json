Law enforcement also offers seminars on security and preventive measures. \n“We are making suggestions and recommendations on security measures taken by gun dealers,” Livingston said. \nA secure storefront with metal gating, deadbolted steel doors and wired glass that triggers an alarm are recommended. But these measures can give a false sense of security. Law enforcement agencies are pitching secondary layers of security inside the stores that include securing all weapons, interior motion detectors, glass break detection, audible security alarms and maintenance to ensure all security systems are working properly. Andy Cross, The Denver Post A Jefferson County crime scene investigator at work on the front door of the Colorado Gun Broker in the Bowles Marketplace near Bowles Ave and Wadsworth Blvd June 21, 2016. A thief or thieves stole over 30 handguns in a smash and grab job overnight. \n“Additional measures slows (thieves) down,” Livingston said. “They’re not spending a long time in the store. They’ve got to get out quickly.” \nIf criminals can’t scoop weapons quickly, they’ll race out empty-handed knowing their entry has triggered an alarm and police are on the way. \nMost thieves are local, and most of the stolen weapons stay in the state. The stolen weapons, predominantly handguns, often are sold on the street to other felons or are exchanged for drugs. These guns sell on the street for $100 to $400 for handguns, $300 to $600 for a shotgun or rifle. \n“The initial theft is dangerous in and of itself,” Livingston said. “These guns then go on to be in the hands of other criminals, people who can’t purchase them legally. The guns are going to be used in crimes. They aren’t just a danger to law enforcement; they’re a danger to the public.” \nIn the past year, ATF and police have arrested 15 suspects and recovered 55 firearms stolen from dealers in Colorado. Some weapons have been recovered during investigations of violent crimes. \n“These are weapons used to harm and kill other people,” said Bob Troyer, acting U.S. attorney for Colorado. \nIn February, Eric Michael Perez, 20, of Denver was sentenced to just less than six years in federal prison for his part in a June 21, 2016, theft of 35 guns from the Colorado Gun Broker in Jefferson County. \nProsecutors in recent years have made strides convicting those involved in straw purchases of firearms. Such crimes can include sellers of firearms lying about the identity of the purchaser or a surrogate buyer purchasing a weapon for third party, possibly a felon. Success in such convictions likely has reduced the number of guns on the street, and that, in turn, likely has fueled the uptick in late-night smash-and-grabs at storefronts. \n“It’s a record-breaking year. We don’t want to hide from that or minimize it,” Troyer said. “It’s a serious risk, and we are throwing everything we have at it.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T12:07:51.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
