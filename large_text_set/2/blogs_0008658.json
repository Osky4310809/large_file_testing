The Democratic Party must be the party that fights for and that is composed of young people. As a generation, millennials have surpassed baby boomers as the largest voting bloc. Consequently, the livelihood of the Democratic Party depends on its ability to engage young people. However, working as student leaders in the party for many years and rising to the national level, we have seen young people taken for granted by our party and its candidates. Moving forward, millennials must extend beyond a political talking point. We demand investment and a serious seat at the table. We have a great amount of respect and appreciation for the politicians and staffers that have furthered youth issues. Our party platform focuses on making debt-free college a reality, reducing the burden of student loans, providing economic mobility, and ensuring that young people have access to affordable healthcare. You’ll rarely find a Democratic candidate that does not mention youth issues. For this, we are grateful but not satisfied. The budgets of the DNC and the campaigns of our candidates do not reflect the rhetoric they uplift. We have advocated for significant investment in young people and their careers as political operatives for years with little success. This has included paid internships on campaigns, comprehensive training programs, and full time staffers focused solely on youth and college participation, among other things listed below. There have been significant strides made under the interim leadership at the DNC, but there is so much more to accomplish. The party has the ability to further this trajectory with the election of a new party chair. Working together as voting members at the DNC, we have used our votes to leverage our fight for youth investment. For months, in our conversations with candidates for every DNC office, we spoke of the institutional barriers that limit full millennial participation and of our vision for a youth-inclusive Democratic Party. We were thrilled to see that candidates for DNC offices have listened to us. It is encouraging to hear them speak about youth investment in speeches, at forums, and in social media. Although we appreciate the spirit, we need specifics. We need enthusiastic commitment. We needed a way to hold them accountable. Too much depends on the future of Democratic Party and our country to trust talking points that may become empty promises. Accordingly, last week, we sent a letter to all of the candidates for DNC Chair and their staff outlining specific actions they must take to empower CDA and our membership composed of thousands of students, should they be elected. CDA is the official student arm of the DNC and is the only youth organization structurally within the national party. Please find the letter we sent to the candidates below. On February 8, 2017, the candidates for Chair of the Democratic National Committee received these action items from the leadership of the College Democrats of America, the official youth arm of the DNC. On February 8, 2017, the candidates for Chair of the Democratic National Committee received these action items from the leadership of the College Democrats of America, the official youth arm of the DNC. To date, as of February 13, 2017, all candidates for DNC Chair have committed to the action items to revive student engagement at the DNC. We’d like to personally thank Sally Boynton Brown, Raymond Buckley, Pette Buttigeg, Keith Ellison, Jehmu Greene, Jaime Harrison, Peter Peckarksy, Tom Perez, Sam Ronan, and Robert Vinson Brannum for supporting CDA and promoting college activism in each of their respective candidacies. In essence, the Democratic Party is the only party that is aligned with young people and our issues. As National President and Vice President of CDA, committing to the action items we have outlined and committing to rebuilding CDA is a prerequisite for earning our support and our vote. There is simply no other way that we could in good conscious support a candidate and uphold our responsibility to serve our members and their interests. We are working to hold the DNC accountable in standing with young people and fostering their participation within the party and in public service. We hope that the upcoming elections in Atlanta catapults us towards achieving these goals. Regardless of the outcome, we will remain steadfast in our commitment to empowering student activists this election and beyond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:01:49.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
