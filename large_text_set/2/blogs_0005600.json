They observe, listen, understand, and talk to us without speaking. Our furry friends, who live in our homes and become family, have a lot to teach us about life, love, and everything in between. But, many people believe that we share this extra special bond only with dogs. Let's not under-estimate the power of the purr machines that some of us live with. Yes, contrary to popular belief, cats also have a lot of learning to offer. They are gravely misunderstood creatures, who hold secrets to many important things, especially love. Yes, that's right. They have wrongly earned the reputation of being unaffectionate and aloof, but they are a lot more than that! Here's everything our feline friends teach us about love: Boundaries, man! What's the most important ingredient of a long-term relationship? Healthy boundaries. Knowing where to draw the line in this game of give-and-take, and no one knows it better than cats! Never compromise on who you are for love Cats are moody. Sometimes, they are lazy. Sometimes, they are feisty. Sometimes, they don't want to look at your face, and at other times, they won't leave you alone no matter what. But, most importantly, they are unabashed and unapologetic about who they are. They will never do anything just to please you. That's why they are so endearing! Take your time Cats scope you out before they make you one of their own. Not everyone is to be trusted, and they will not pretend otherwise. They make you work for their love. Just how it should be. But once you earn their trust, then they have your back for the rest of eternity. Physical intimacy is supremely important Cats will curl up and sleep on your face at night. They will sit on your lap when you poop. They will park themselves on your laptop to give you company when you work. And when you are walking around the house, they will walk right next to you, grazing against your bare ankles. Because that's their equivalent of holding your hand. It's important to be a little vain Cats spend hours licking themselves clean. They will not compromise on their self-grooming regime for any amount of petting or food, or whatever else you can tempt them with. It is only when they are primped up to satisfaction will they come to you for love. It's awesome to hang out together, but it's okay to be alone as well Cats love hanging out with you, and they will show you their gratitude and joy with generous purrs and nuzzles. They will make sure you know how happy they are to be with you. But, they will not throw a shit fit when you leave because they know you've got your own life. More importantly, because they love their own life!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:35:39.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
