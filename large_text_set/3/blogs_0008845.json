ADVERTISEMENT \nHassan was killed after an operation launched by Joint Task Force Tawi-Tawi and police in his residence in Barangay (village) Panglima Alari in Sitangkai. \nTroops also recovered one M16 rifle, five speedboats and several outboard motors found in the residence of Hassan, Petinglay said. \nHe also reportedly used his share of ransom money for illegal drug operations in the municipalities of Sibutu, Sipangkot and Bongao in Tawi-Tawi. \n“Hassan recruited cohorts and acquired several speedboats to sustain illegal activities and became the key facilitator in the illegal drugs trade in Tawi-Tawi,” Petinglay said.
