Samuel Fishwick meets the brains behind London’s most dramatic pop-ups Wednesday 1 March 2017 14:32 GMT Click to followES Going Out A taste for magic: Jacapo Sarzi in his workshop Daniel Hambury/Stella Pictures \nAll Jacopo Sarzi needs for his party trick is a humble carrot. “There are six or seven things I can do with this carrot that will work on your palate differently,” says the Hackney-based Italian, 31. He won £50,000 of free advertising at this year’s Evening Standard Young Progress Makers event at the Roundhouse with his Food Design Lab, a pop-up that turns catering into mouth-watering performance art. \nHe takes a carrot and cuts part of it into discs, grates some, cuts a section into buttons then makes a purée, a mousse and a foam. “The perception of taste is related to shape, and the cutting of vegetables can either enhance the natural flavour or provoke something new in your mouth,” he says. “In theatre you can make something simple into something exceptional, such as a white canvas that represents the sky. In food, I like to do the same, heightening the experience of each ingredient.” \nAt Sarzi’s events his meticulous craftsmanship supports the cooking. One featured a wooden sorbet machine, invented by the Romans and reconstructed by Sarzi in his Trinity Buoy Wharf workshop. \nAnother, inspired by the world’s blue zones, where people live longer, was full of the tastes of islands such as Sicily, Icaria and Okinawa: buffalo mozzarella, gnocchi, steamed buns with yellow-fin tuna, smoked prosciutto, pecorino cheese and smoked ricotta, served on hand-carved, palette-like trays. Meticulous craftsmanship: Sarzi's ice sculpting workshop \nSarzi studied ceramics and design in Faenza, Italy, followed by Erasmus years in Finland and France. In Paris he was mentored by food designer Marc Bretillot, who introduced him to a Michelin-starred firmament of restauranteering. In 2012 he moved to London, which he says refined his culinary tastes further. “London is probably the best place in the world now for different food cultures,” he says. “It’s like a salad. There are so many different ingredients that come together nicely.” \nAs for heroes, there’s Yottam Ottolenghi , who “took vegetables to another level” and Jamie Oliver who, although not one of Sarzi’s favourite chefs, is a “great person for the battles he fought for better food”. Others include Ferran Adria, Bretillot and Alan Yao , although he has no plans to emulate Yao’s sprawling Wagamama empire. “I don’t want to become a millionaire, just have the success to work happily.” 35 must-try dishes in London 35 must-try dishes in London 1/36 35 must-try dishes in London \nClick through the gallery to see which dishes made the cut, and count-up how many you've eaten... 2/36 Bone marrow on toast with parsley salad at St John \nNeither restaurants or dishes get more iconic than this.

At the moment he works with a small team “like an octopus, a one- man band, still clearing up the tables and picking up the rubbish”. Not that he’s complaining. “I like to do everything, it’s just that when you can delegate, you can grow.” Right now he does between seven and 10 events a year, earning between £5,000 and £45,000 on each (he invests around £10,000 on each event). “It’s about quality, not quantity,” he says. After winning the Progress Makers award he plans to expand his kitchen and reach out to more people. London will continue to be his base. “When I arrived here I felt electricity in the air,” he says. “For creatives and foodies, London now is what 19th-century Paris must have been like for artists.” But the shadow of Brexit hangs over his business, with rising costs for studio space and produce. “I haven’t felt hate or disrespect in London but if the electricity goes, I may follow.” Pushing the palate: Sarzi’s canapés \nThat’s not to say he’s not in love with the sense of community here. He lives in a household of five: a British singer-songwriter, a Czech fashion designer, a Portuguese cabinetmaker and a Hungarian in marketing. They are often joined by his girlfriend Matilde, an Italian set designer he met in London. “I enjoy a big epicurean roast once every three or four weeks with friends at mine,” he says, and loves eating out at Sager + Wilde in Hackney and P Franco in Clapton. But his true love, his undying love, is pizza. “It’s like going to church. It’s everything.” \nHis bugbear is people who won’t try new things. “When they come to one of my events, it’s like a performance so they have to respect that. If you don’t like rock music, don’t go to a rock concert.” \nSarzi’s events may be meticulous in their construction but they’re fuelled by a sense of adventure.
