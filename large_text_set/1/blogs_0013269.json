The Club is delighted to confirm that @LucasPiazon 's loan deal has been extended until the end of the season > https://t.co/GO5DVPAb3x pic.twitter.com/PCACHJPpYZ — Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) January 17, 2017 “The Club”! Piazon, who will celebrate his 23rd birthday in a couple days, seems to have fully bought into The Club’s ethos and it wouldn’t surprise me if he eventually converted this into a permanent move, provided that Fulham The Club could afford him. Chelsea paid £5m+ back in 2011 (possibly rising to £10m), and we would look to turn a small profit as usual. A bit further down the pyramid, Chelsea defender/midfielder Dion Conroy has extended his loan stay at non-league Aldershot Town. This news is possibly almost a month old, but I don’t recall reading about it before, so here it is anyway. We are delighted that Dion Conroy @dionjc95 has extended his loan from @ChelseaFC until the end of the season https://t.co/uycaI3dN2w pic.twitter.com/niC0NYf7kX — Aldershot Town FC (@OfficialShots) December 22, 2016 Chelsea official also confirmed Jhoao Rodríguez’s loan switch from Santa Fe to Cortuluá in Colombia ( HUGE NEWS ), as well as goalkeeper Nathan Baxter’s loan switch from Met Police to Solihull Moors. We’re really scraping the depths of the league pyramid here... ️ #SMFC boss Liam McDonald: \"It's a big boost for the football club to bring in such a young talent from @ChelseaFC .\" https://t.co/NaUw4BJXgW — Solihull Moors FC (@SolihullMoors) January 16, 2017  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T04:17:20.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
