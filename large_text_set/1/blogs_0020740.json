It is also the world’s second-largest economy and the target of accusations by Trump that it is stealing American jobs.\nSpicer declined to elaborate when asked how the United States could enforce such a move against China, except to say: “I think, as we develop further, we’ll have more information on it.”\nTillerson narrowly won approval from a Senate committee on Monday and is expected to win confirmation from the full Senate.\nRisk of dangerous escalation \nMilitary experts said that while the U.S. Navy has extensive capabilities in Asia to stage blockading operations with ships, submarines and planes, any such move against China’s growing naval fleets would risk dangerous escalation.\nAides have said that Trump plans a major naval build-up in East Asia to counter China’s rise.\nChina’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the White House remarks.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry said earlier this month it could not guess what Tillerson meant by his remarks, which came after Trump questioned Washington’s longstanding and highly sensitive “one-China” policy over Taiwan.\nWashington-based South China Sea expert Mira Rapp-Hooper at the Center for a New American Security called the threats to bar China’s access in the South China Sea “incredible” and said it had no basis in international law.\n“A blockade – which is what would be required to actually bar access – is an act of war,” she added.\n“The Trump administration has begun to draw red lines in Asia that they will almost certainly not be able to uphold, but they may nonetheless be very destabilizing to the relationship with China, invite crises, and convince the rest of the world that the United States is an unreliable partner.”\nBonnie Glaser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank called Spicer’s remarks “worrisome” and said the new administration was “sending confusing and conflicting messages.”\nDean Cheng, a China expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Spicer’s remarks showed the South China Sea was an important issue for the Trump administration.\nHe said it was significant that neither Spicer nor Tillerson had been specific as to what actions would be taken and this left open the possibility that economic measures – instead of military steps – could be used against China and firms that carry out island building.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:19:33.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
