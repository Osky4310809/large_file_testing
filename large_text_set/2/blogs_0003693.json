I’m not just referring to the big policy moves, most of which conservatives can support fairly easily (so far). I mean the whole whiplash-inducing spectacle: the unfiltered, impulsive tweeting, bizarre interview non sequiturs, glib insults and distractions. \nIf you honestly have no idea what I’m talking about, you may need to be de-programmed from a personality cult. But for example: over the weekend, Donald Trump questioned the legitimacy of what he described as a “ so-called judge ” and suggested — again — that America has no right to judge Vladimir Putin’s Russia given all the killing America has done . Other examples might include recent controversies over everything from inaugural crowd sizes to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on The Apprentice . \nIt’s been interesting to see how various Republican leaders respond to Trump Unfiltered. Sometimes they’ll simply say they’re not going to respond to every distraction emanating from the president’s mouth or twitter feed. Others fall back on saying the president is “unconventional” in the way he communicates, so get over it. \nThis is a particularly popular talking point among his talk radio and cable TV boosters. It’s almost as popular as attacking the Mainstream Media’s very real double standard toward Trump and Obama. \nVice President Mike Pence has taken the “unconventional” defense to an art form. When asked about the “so-called” judge controversy by NBC’s Chuck Todd, Pence replied, “I think people find it very refreshing that they not only understand this president's mind but they understand how he feels about things. He expresses himself in a unique way .” Political consultant Alex Castellanos, a Trump enthusiast, went so far as to suggest that, “Donald Trump's unpredictability is a form of deterrence . It keeps bad people a step back.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:51:32.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
