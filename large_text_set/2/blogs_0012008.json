House Republicans were given a packet of talking points and legislative proposals to take with them when they return home for the Presidents’ Day recess next week. “After the House returns following the Presidents’ Day,” Mr. Ryan said, “we intend to introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. It has become increasingly clear that this law is collapsing. People’s premiums are getting higher and higher. Their deductibles are soaring, and their choices are dwindling.” Mr. Price told House Republicans that Mr. Trump “wants to repeal and replace concurrently, and he is absolutely committed to that,” a person who was in the room reported. “The president is all in on this,” Mr. Price said. He urged lawmakers to embrace the president’s timetable, saying: “Let’s not miss this opportunity. Let’s go shoulder to shoulder, arm to arm.” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said that he and other Senate committee chairmen were working with their House counterparts, with the goal of developing a “consensus document.” The House, he said, will probably act first but “will have the input of senators and the president.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Ryan’s presentation on Thursday was meant to generate a sense of momentum for the Republicans’ campaign to eviscerate President Barack Obama ’s health care law — a campaign that has been plagued by apprehensions, doubts and divisions among Republicans in the last few weeks.
