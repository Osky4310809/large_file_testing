Do you feel your life has meaning and purpose? If the answer is not a resounding yes, have you given thought as to what might be blocking your sense of happiness and purpose? Could it be that you have too much STUFF? \nI’ve written a number of articles about the health benefits of happiness and offered many different strategies shown to increase your happiness level, but I’ve never approached the subject from the angle of re-evaluating your material possessions. \nWhile there’s no wealth of scientific data to show that living with less stuff will increase your happiness, a growing number of people insist that this is in fact part of the equation. \nOver the past few years, a trend best known as “minimalism” has sprung up, with converts hailing the elimination of excess material trappings as the answer to their growing sense of unhappiness and discontent. “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,” which is available on Netflix, has helped spread that message. Why Do We Hold on to Things? \nThe film features Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, two childhood friends best known as “The Minimalists” to the millions of people who read their blog and books. \nMillburn’s journey into minimalism began seven years ago. He was earning a respectable salary and had all the trappings a successful professional married man could want. Then, within the span of a month, his mother died and his wife left him. \nFaced with the task of sorting through and storing all of his mother’s belongings, he had a number of epiphanies, which he describes in the TEDx Talk, “The Art of Letting Go,” above. \nFor example, he realized the reason his mother had held on to every scrap of paper from his first through fourth-grade classes was probably because she was trying to hold on to the memories of his youth. \nBut looking through those papers, he realized that “the memories are in us, not in our things,” and that discarding the papers would not have eliminated her memories of his childhood. Nor would his own memories of those days be destroyed by tossing the papers out. \nTo make a long story short, he ended up canceling the U-Haul truck and the storage unit he’d reserved to transport and store his mother’s belongings and sold, donated and threw away virtually all of it. And then, when he got back home, he did the same with his own stuff. Increasing Your Wealth by Living With Less \nNicodemus’ story began in much the same way. By his late 20s, he was making lots of money and had all the material goods he ever wanted. Yet he felt depressed, depleted and overworked. When meeting Millburn one day, he was astounded to see his friend — who’d just lost his mother and his wife — so upbeat and happy. \nUpon hearing Millburn’s story, he decided to give it a try. The rest, as they say, is history. Today, the pair travel the world sharing the benefits of living with less, which include more time to focus on your health, relationships and personal growth, community involvement, and building a life that has meaning. \nReducing your spending — buying only that which you actually need — also brings financial freedom by eliminating debt and increasing your savings. \nAs noted by Nicodemus, the average credit card debt for Americans who carry a balance is $16,000, 1 and 38 percent of U.S. households carry some amount of credit card debt. The total outstanding consumer debt in the U.S. in 2016 alone was a staggering $3.4 TRILLION. \nMeanwhile, financial hardship and work stress are two significant contributors to depression and anxiety . \nThe answer, they point out, is to buy less. Many who have adopted the minimalist lifestyle claim they’ve been able to significantly reduce the amount of time they have to work to pay their bills, freeing up time for volunteer work, creative pursuits and taking care of their personal health. Radical Measures \nWhen it comes to decluttering and minimizing, there are many ways to go about it. Millburn spent months whittling down his possessions to the bare necessities while Nicodemus decided on a more radical and faster approach. \nTogether, they packed up every last item in his apartment, including the furniture, as you would if you were moving. \nThen, over the course of three weeks, he dug out items from the boxes as he needed them — his toothbrush and a towel here, a cup, plate and fork there. At the end of those three weeks, he knew exactly what he actually needed, and what was superfluous. \nApproximately 80 percent of all his belongings were still in boxes, and all of it was sold, donated or thrown away. So, did it make him happier? Yes, he claims, and it just might make you more content too. \nAs noted by Millburn, we often keep things “just in case,” even though we’ve never needed the item in question in several years or even decades of owning it. Meanwhile, it’s taking up space and costing you both time and money in storage, cleaning and upkeep. Worse, all that excess has a tendency to overwhelm us and prevent us from seeing and appreciating our true “treasures,” be it a particularly cherished item or our own family members. Baby Steps \nIf a “packing party” sounds too extreme, consider Millburn’s approach of whittling things down a little at a time. You may start by asking yourself: How might my life be better with less? What do I value in life? Does this thing add value to my life? \nOne way of making slow but steady progress would be to eliminate one unnecessary item per day.
