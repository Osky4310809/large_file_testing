USC Trojans guard Elijah Stewart dunks over Arizona Wildcats center Dusan Ristic. (Photo: Casey Sapio, USA TODAY Sports)   \nBreaking down the two First Four NCAA tournament games in Dayton, Ohio. No. 16 North Carolina Central (25-8) vs. No. 16 UC Davis (22-12) \nMidwest Region \nTime, TV : 6:40 p.m. ET, truTV \n► Why North Carolina Central will win : The Eagles are an athletic group that likes to push the pace. They aren’t afraid to make the risky pass, which can be a minus but could serve them well in this setting. Coach LeVelle Moton also has several bench contributors whom he can count on for double-digit minutes if needed. \n► Why UC Davis will win : This is the Aggies’ first rodeo, but not so for coach Jim Les, who led his alma mater Bradley to the Sweet 16 in 2006. He was known for his long-range shooting and precision passing as a player, and he has taught his own guards how to find openings. No. 11 Providence (20-12) vs. No. 11 Southern California (24-9) \nEast Region \nTime, TV : 9:10 p.m. ET, truTV \n► Why Providence will win : By season’s end, the Friars were as hot as any team not named Villanova in the Big East. They have good size throughout their lineup and are equipped to take advantage if the Trojans have an off shooting night. \n► Why USC will win : Don’t think for a minute that the USC veterans aren’t aware of who sent them packing from the tournament a year ago. The Trojans will be ready for this rematch with the Friars. Bennie Boatwright has excellent touch and range for a big man and can be counted on at the free-throw line as well. \nMEET THE 68 NCAA TOURNEY TEAMS Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
