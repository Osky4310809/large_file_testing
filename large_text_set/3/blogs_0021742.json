Crazy futuristic transport \nT he technology is just a pipedream at the moment, with rival companies Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT)at the forefront of developments. \nWhile Hyperloop One has already started construction on an impressive test track built in the middle of the Nevada desert, HTT is focusing on constructing the pods.

It has been crucial in our development to go past the simple requirements of freight in order to build a better and safer system for everyone.\" We announce today that we have begun construction of the 1st #Hyperloop passenger capsule in the world. https://t.co/yBGXOlXs1l #HTT — Hyperloop | HTT (@hyperloopglobal) March 21, 2017 \nT his first capsule, set to be officially unveiled in 2018, is “the culmination of over three years and thousands of hours of design, research, and analysis”, say HTT \nThe proposed pod will be able to hold 28-40 passengers and will zoom along the track at 760 mph, if hyperloop ever fully takes off, HTT claims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:46:49.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
