We had the chance to talk to director Scott Derrickson 1-on-1, and we asked him about whether the more overtly supernatural horror elements of the comics (Dracula, Nightmare) might have a place in Doctor Strange 2 and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is generally sci-fi oriented. \n“I wouldn’t necessarily rule anything out,” said Derrickson of Doctor Strange 2 . “That’s certainly where the comics went in the ’80s but I also think that was probably the weakest era of the comics. The alternate dimensions and possibilities of the multiverse that we set up with the first film already give limitless possibilities. What I will say is that the goal would not be to underutilize that, or to create something that was less innovative than the first ‘Doctor Strange.’ The comics, especially the Lee/Ditko comics, were always pushing into unexpectedly weird places and storylines. That has continued on into the current Doctor Strange comics, which are really great. So anything’s possible with Doctor Strange, I wouldn’t rule anything out.” \nSo while Derrickson seemed hesitant to confirm or deny what direction the Strange franchise might take from here, he seemed to indicate that a more overt horror presence was something of a nadir for the comics. He has stated in the past that he considers Nightmare a personal favorite for a Doctor Strange villain, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he will show up in the sequel or be treated in a way closer to the horror genre.
