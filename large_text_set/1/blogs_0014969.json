File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - The Philippines has filed a diplomatic protest against China in response to a report by a US think tank that Beijing appears to have installed weapons, including anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems, on all seven artificial islands it has built in the South China, Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. said yesterday. \n“We have taken action on that. We have issued a note verbale,” Yasay said in an interview on CNN Philippines. \nThe Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) said it has been tracking construction of hexagonal structures on Kagitingan (Fiery Cross), Panganiban (Mischief) and Zamora (Subi) reefs in the Spratly Islands since June and July last year. China has built airstrips on these islands, capable of accommodating large military aircraft. \n“I just want to assure the Filipino people that when we take action at engaging China in this dispute, we do not want to take such aggressive, provocative action that will not solve the problem,” Yasay said. ”We cannot engage China in a war.” \nOn Thursday, Yasay did not categorically answer when asked if the Philippines had filed a diplomatic protest against China for the latter’s installation of weapons systems on the artificial islands. \nBut he said the government was verifying the information as he gave assurance that steps were being taken to protect the country’s interest.   \n“I would like to give you the assurance that the Philippines under our watch, under the watch of President Duterte, will never take any actions that will undermine or prejudice our claims, our sovereignty,” Yasay added. \n“Having said that and that assurance being made, I would not want to get into any other details of any other question because that again can be counterproductive,” Yasay said.
