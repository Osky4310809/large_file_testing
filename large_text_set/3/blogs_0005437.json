The building — a neoclassical gem with purple doors on the outside and pastel light filtering through the stained glass to the pews inside — sat dormant for a time. But the Methodist church still owns the building at Ogden and 16th streets, and a new ministry was in the planning.\nOn Jan. 1, the Rev. Jasper Peters officially left his position as an associate pastor at downtown’s Trinity UMC to work full-time at building the new church, which is named, simply, Belong.\nRJ Sangosti, The Denver Post The Rev. Jasper Peters, at Belong, a new church in Uptown. The church will hold its first weekly Sunday worship service on March 5. Peters hopes people take the name Belong as an honest invitation. The early conversations about Belong, he said, included questions such as “What if we were diverse, and inclusive, and we love justice?” and “What if we try to organize ourselves in the world in a way that we can make a difference?”\nSunday marks the start of Belong’s weekly worship services.\nAlthough this is a new church, and it’s the first time Peters has been at the helm of a congregation, it’s a role he has been preparing for his entire life. His father, the Rev. James D. Peters Jr., was the longtime pastor of Denver’s New Hope Baptist Church and a civil rights movement leader who marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, Ala. Peters Jr. retired from the pulpit more than 10 years ago, but he hasn’t retired from social justice — just last summer on the steps of the state Capitol, he spoke out against violence  after the shooting that targeted police officers in Dallas.\nGrowing up, said Peters, who is now 32, “I remember always being somewhere where someone needed something.” His father would get a call, and they’d be out the door.\n“For me, seeking justice in a social setting is not a separate category than seeking holiness here inside these walls,” he said, sitting in a pew at Belong during an interview last week. “Growing up with him, doing this work — and having done so much of this work already — it’s just a continuation of everything I’ve been taught.\nRelated Articles February 15, 2017 Mother of four fears deportation, declares sanctuary at Denver church February 2, 2017 Temple Aaron in Trinidad, 128-year-old shuttered synagogue, added to list of Colorado’s most endangered places December 1, 2016 Church-turned-condo features stained glass windows, soaring ceilings, choir loft for $1.85 million November 29, 2016 Restoration work underway on iconic north Capitol Hill basilica September 9, 2016 Karen Oliveto, first openly gay bishop in the United Methodist Church, will serve in Colorado “How I learned to follow Jesus included working for justice outside of these four walls.”\nBuilding a church that aims for diversity isn’t just about ethnicity or age, or deliberately welcoming LGBT individuals, Peters said. “It’s not the case that this is only this haven of progressive people or ideals,” he said. “There are still many people (in the Belong community) who come from conservative backgrounds and ideals.”\nPeters said his co-pastor, the Rev. Justin Bullis, “is one of those folks who comes from a more conservative evangelical background.”\nRJ Sangosti, The Denver Post The Rev. Justin Bullis at his new church, Belong, in Uptown, March 1, 2017. Bullis, 35, is bringing a mix of contemporary and traditional music to worship at Belong. “I was raised in very conservative evangelical churches that sang from the hymnal, and in a really musical family,” he said. “And then in high school, of course, there’s the youth group that needs the rock band.”\nHe earned his degree in musical ministry from Colorado Christian University and worked at evangelical churches with house bands in the Denver area for more than a decade. At Belong, he’ll serve as the pastor of worship and outreach. (A Methodist provision for “licensed local pastors” allows him to serve there.)\nIncreasing numbers of Americans report that they not only don’t go to church but are completely done with church, according to Pew Research Center studies. A 2015 Pew report even declares  “Millennials increasingly are driving growth of ‘nones’”  in the headline. The rise of those “nones” and “dones” are a concern to church leaders of every stripe, including in mainline denominations such as the UMC.\nBullis speaks fondly of his years in evangelical churches, which served an important role in his journey. The experience also allows him to connect with those “dones” who left an evangelical church. “I feel,” Bullis said, “like I have a voice with those people. ‘Wait, before you leave, there’s one more brand of Christianity!’ ”\nA small group has been gathering to plan Belong for months now, and “we’re all sharing our past experiences with the church,” said Chris Palmiotto, an IT professional who had been attending Trinity UMC. “To bring so many different perspectives together has been hugely beneficial, … but (you) also recognize that you can’t appease everyone, you can’t make a perfect church.”\nJes Jones, a criminal defense attorney who met Bullis at Foothills Community Church in Arvada, where he was a pastor before, said her passion for social justice is what drew her to Belong. It’s important to have a community when you do social-justice work, she said. “It’s easy to get burned out.”\nBishop Karen Oliveto , who leads the UMC’s Mountain Sky region, which includes Colorado, said Belong’s opening in the old St. Paul space “continues the life cycle of our churches.”\n“We closed a church, but we don’t see death as final,” she said. “So what I love is that it’s a resurrection occurring in the St. Paul building — and maintaining some of the core values of St. Paul’s, but making them available for those of us who are in Denver in a changing demographic, in a time of great change.”\nOne of the things she appreciates about this region in the UMC, she said, is the willingness to experiment, to fail and to try new things again. “And I think that’s the future.”\n \nBelong \n1615 N.
