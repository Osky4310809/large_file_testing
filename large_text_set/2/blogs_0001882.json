Samsung Galaxy S8 leaked schematics reveal rear-mounted fingerprint sensor; teaser expected at MWC By February 2, 2017 “The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will feature large screens integrated into small bodies” \nIn the past couple of weeks, several live images , renders and specs of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus flagships have hit the interwebs. The brand is expected to launch the phone at an event on March 29th . Now, CNet Korea has created detailed schematics of the Galaxy S8 and its bigger sibling, which reveal a couple of important details about these devices. In addition, a report suggests that the brand will share a teaser of the phone at MWC later this month. \nAs per the schematics, the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will feature rear-mounted fingerprint sensors, which will be located beside the camera. The phones will feature highly-narrow bezels and dual-edged curved displays. The Galaxy S8 will be a compact offering, and will be 131.58mm long and 68.05mm wide, even with its rumoured 5.8-inch display. It will be considerably smaller than its predecessor. \nThe Galaxy S8 Plus, on the other hand, will be 159.53mm long and 78.5mm wide. It is expected to be equipped with a 6.2-inch display. It is tipped that these dimensions will give both the devices an aspect ratio of about 18.5 : 9. Note that the schematics posted by CNet are based on an eyewitness account, so they might not be the real deal. \nComing to the teaser report, Korea Herald suggests that Samsung will use MWC as a platform to introduce the first teaser video of the Galaxy S8 to kick off the buzz around it. The brand has scheduled an event for February 26th, where it is expected to unveil the Galaxy Tab S3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T09:54:25.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
