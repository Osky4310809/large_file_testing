Instagram: @rosiehw ID: 10532267 Exclusively posting a big life moment — a pregnancy, wedding, or engagement — brings new people into a celebrity’s social media sphere. And the prevalence of Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram has created more avenues for them to reach a wider audience.\nIt also eliminates having to deal with highly competitive media organizations, said Rob Silverstein, executive producer of Access Hollywood .\nMerry Christmas from my family to yours!\n— Jessica Simpson (@JessicaSimpson) ID: 10532284 “If you have a big announcement or pictures, and you just give it to one outlet, you can upset other outlets — ‘Why did you pick them?’ and that kind of nonsense,” he said.\nPublic attitudes on profiting directly off of children, who are now seen far less in paparazzi photos, have also changed.\nSilverstein said he doesn’t see first-baby exclusive photo deals much anymore, unless the money is being donated to charity. “To me, it feels like you are making money off your kid, and that is distasteful to me,” he said.\nView this image ›\nArmie Hammer and Elizabeth Chambers in 2016.

While it was widely speculated behind closed doors that Amal and George Clooney were expecting, entertainment outlets kept off the news until Julie Chen confirmed it on CBS’s The Talk .\n“We as a show have a policy, even if we know someone is pregnant, we don’t out them until they want it announced,” Silverstein said.\nIt all adds up to more control for celebrities.\n“It is here now,” he said, “and it is going to continue to grow.”\n3.\nBeyoncé Just Announced She’s Pregnant With Twins\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10532264", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/BQTTopJAfBA/#author_rosiehw", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/283611777089011712"], "published": "2017-02-15T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:44:45.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
