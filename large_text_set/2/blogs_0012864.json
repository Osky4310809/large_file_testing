Bloomberg | Getty Images Entrepreneur Staff \nIn times of great difficulty, when it’s hard to summon the reasons to get up in the morning, there is some comfort. That comfort comes from the things we can still control. \nWe often discount the role luck has in our successes, believing them wholly earned -- something bought and paid for with sweat and persistence. This can leave us angry and unprepared for our failures, leaving us feeling as if we’ve been robbed or cheated. In reality, our lives should make the best of both work and luck. \nOf course, that does little to ease the sting of loss or unfairness. The only remedy to for that, the only salve that works, is strength. It's a steady regimen of putting one foot in front of the other. \nLet these quotes on strength and resilience serve as your balm and inspiration -- and help you on your long road forward. Michael Kovac | Getty Images Embrace the fear. \n\"There are few things more liberating in life than having your worst fear realized. … It’s not easy, but your perceived failure can become a catalyst for profound reinvention. … Whether you fear it or not, disappointment will come. The beauty is that through disappointment you can gain clarity, and with clarity comes conviction and true originality.\" \n-- Conan O’Brien, talk show host, during a 2011 commencement address at Dartmouth University 2 / 16 CBS Photo Archive | Getty Images Honor what was lost. \n\"She knew more than her share of tragedy, losing her brother and her husband and three of her sons. But her love for her family and her faith in God somehow gave her the strength not only to go on but to love life without bitterness and instill in all of us a gratitude for every day we have together. And I know it may sound greedy to want more days with a person who lived so long, but the fact that my mother was 92 does not diminish, it only magnifies, the enormity of the room whose door has now quietly shut.\" \n-- Stephen Colbert, talk show host, in a tribute to his mother after her death 3 / 16 Jonathan Leibson | Getty Images Accept your reality. \n\"One year and 13 days ago, I lost my husband, Dave. His death was sudden and unexpected. … A few weeks after Dave died, I was talking to my friend Phil about a father-son activity that Dave was not here to do. We came up with a plan to fill in for Dave. I cried to him, 'But I want Dave.' Phil put his arm around me and said, 'Option A is not available. So let’s just kick the shit out of option B.' We all at some point live some form of option B. The question is: What do we do then?\" \n-Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, during a 2016 commencement speech at the University of California at Berkeley. 4 / 16 Paras Griffin | Getty Images Remember: Setbacks are natural. \n\"At some point you are bound to stumble because if you’re constantly doing what we do, raising the bar. If you’re constantly pushing yourself higher, higher the law of averages not to mention the Myth of Icarus predicts that you will at some point fall. And when you do I want you to know this, remember this: there is no such thing as failure. Failure is just life trying to move us in another direction.\" Tasia Wells | Getty Images Forget perfect. \n\"If you focus on perfection, you may never get out of the gate since you'll fear falling short of that. Even in diving, the definition of a score of 10 is excellent, not perfect.\" -Greg Louganis, Olympic diver, in an article on Entrepreneur.com 6 / 16 Bloomberg | Getty Images Hold on. \n“Be hard core. … Hard core means tenacious. Hard core means long-term. Hard core means determined. I don't care what you do, you're going to have to be patient and industrious and really stay after things. … You're going to have to be determined and long-term.\" -- Steve Ballmer, former Microsoft CEO, during a 2014 commencement at the University of Washington 7 / 16 Bloomberg | Getty Images Do what counts. \n\"Back in 2001, when I folded my first company, it wasn’t just that my self-confidence was depleted. I contemplated suicide. It was really dark. And then you realize you sulking isn’t going to make a difference. It’s not going to make you smarter or better. The only thing to do is learn from it, get up and try again.\" \n-- Ben Huh, founder of Cheezburger, during a video interview with Entrepreneur.com 8 / 16 Marla Aufmuth | Getty Images Be fearless. \n\" While I was in Beijing, one of our Chinese journalists, Patrick Song, was detained for hours by authorities. The government meant to scare and intimidate him. Why was he detained? Simply because he worked as a truthful journalist. So what did he do? He came right back to work and quietly got on with things. 'I did what I believe, and that makes me fearless,' Patrick told me after his ordeal.\" -- Jill Abramson, former New York Times executive editor, during a commencement speech at Wake Forest University 9 / 16 Mike Windle | Getty Images Listen to reason. \n\"I listen to motivational tapes and my favorite is an early series by Wayne Dyer , How to Be a No-Limit Person . When I was 16, I saw my good friend get run over by a car and killed. Around the same time, my parents separated, and my dad handed me that series, and said, 'I wish someone gave this to me when I was your age instead of having to discover it when I was 40.' I memorized all 10 tapes. It's my go-to gift for people I care about.\" -- Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx, during an interview with Entrepreneur 10 / 16 Connect with others. \n\"Instinctively and maybe even genetically, we divide the world into ‘us’ and ‘them.’ So the burning question must be: How do all of us together find the ‘we? ’\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T17:02:09.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
