We can base there if we can fare with them or we don’t have a chance. At least against them, we can feel how a champion team plays. It’s an important game for me and for us,” Romeo said in Filipino. \nSo far, Romeo has made a good account of himself in trying to share the wealth with his fellow Batang Pier.

That’s why I was just spotting up and let the others perform. \nRomeo, however, said that if the Batang Pier needs him, he will have no second thoughts of taking over, \n“If I see that they need me, I’ll get the ball and make plays. I saw that they can sustain so the credit goes to our coaches and my teammates.” \nSitting at solo third with a 5-3 card, Romeo doesn’t want GlobalPort to be satisfied with its standing with the chance to get into the top two, which comes with a twice-to-beat incentive in the quarterfinals, still up for grabs. \n“We have to forget that we won today. It’s not a disrespect to NLEX, but our goal has to be making it to number one or number two. We need to set a goal that we can beat San Miguel so our confidence will go higher and believe that we can beat all teams in the PBA.” \nGlobalPort face San Miguel next Saturday at Lapu-Lapu City in Cebu.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T17:42:42.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
