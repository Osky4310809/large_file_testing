You were wrong. So. Very. Wrong. \nBut admit it: You’re so glad she’s still in your life. \nThe real-life meme — actual name Danielle Bregoli — has returned to “Dr. Phil” to finish what she started. \nThe 13-year-old (yeah, she’s 13, HOWBOWDAH?) went head-to-head with the TV host for the second time, so she could finally get the help she needs as a problem-child/boost ratings for “Dr. Phil” to the max. \n— Michael Cameron (@MichaelCameronz) February 10, 2017 \nHowever, this time, the doctor wanted the upper hand, so he invited her in for a chat without an audience. \nIt obviously threw her off. When she entered the room to empty chairs, she was all like, \nWhere is everybody? There’s no hoes. \nBut that didn’t stop her from turning up. If you thought Big D was coming in hot before, you’d better brace yourself for what she says this time. \nThe teenager goes straight for Dr. Phil’s jugular, launching a majorly personal attack on his career. Danielle's back! Find out why her mom is asking for help once again. #DrPhil #cashmeousside pic.twitter.com/0UNQpVJH76 \n— The Dr. Phil Show (@TheDrPhilShow) February 10, 2017 \nA clip from the interview shows Dr. Phil asking Danielle, \nYou’ve gotten a lot of attention on the internet since you were here, is that a good thing or a bad thing? \nShe simply replies, “Both.” To which the host asks, “What’s good about it?” \nThen the little fire-breather comes out with this absolute zinger: \nI guess what’s good for you is I made you just how Oprah made you. You were nothin’ before I came on this show. Giphy \nD MMMMN. \nThe doctor can brush it off all he wants, but we know that comment is tearing him up inside and will, ultimately, be the root of many, many sleepless nights. #PrayForDrPhil. \nHe calmly looks at the camera and responds: \nThank you for that. \nShe quips, “No problem.” \nIt’s a scary exposure of the strange power this girl wields, and a harsh reminder no one, anywhere, in their right-thinking mind, would ever want to be caught outside alone with Big D. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
