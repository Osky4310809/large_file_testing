In fact, more than 50 million Americans suffer from allergies each year and spend more than $18 billion on treatment. \nYou suffer from an allergy when your immune system reacts to a substance that doesn’t cause a reaction in most people. \nThe job of the immune system is to find foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, and get rid of them. In people with allergies, the immune system mistakenly identifies a harmless element like pollen or peanuts as a dangerous intruder and begins to produce chemicals to fight against it. This in turn causes the symptoms of an allergic reaction. \nMany things can trigger an allergic reaction, which can range from mild and annoying to sudden and life-threatening. \nHere are the 10 most common allergy triggers. 1. Pollen \nExposure to pollen, a fine powder produced by trees, grasses and weeds, can trigger an allergic reaction in the body. In fact, pollen is one of the most common causes of allergies in the U.S. \nThe tiny particles are released from trees, weeds and grasses to fertilize parts of other plants. But as the pollen hitch rides on currents of air, sometimes they enter your nasal passage or throat, triggering a type of seasonal allergic reaction. \nThis type of allergy is known as hay fever or rose fever (depending on the season in which the symptoms occur). \nHay fever symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose, a scratchy throat, coughing, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes. \nYou can minimize the discomfort of hay or rose fever by staying indoors as much as possible on hot, windy days when pollen counts are high. Also, keep your doors and windows closed and use an air conditioner to lower indoor humidity and reduce the amount of airborne pollen that finds its way indoors. 2. Animal Dander \nMany families around the world have pets. In the U.S. alone, the American Pet Products Association estimates that 65 percent of households have a pet. \nOwning a pet has many benefits , but it can be a common allergy trigger for you or your family members. \nThe proteins present in a pet’s dander (skin flakes), saliva and urine can cause an allergic reaction. It can also aggravate asthma symptoms in some people. Moreover, pet hair or fur can collect pollen, mold spores and other outdoor allergens, thus bringing those common triggers into your home. \nSome symptoms of a pet dander allergy are sneezing, a runny nose, itchy or watery eyes, nasal congestion, an itchy nose, coughing, facial pressure and pain due to inflammation of the sinuses, difficulty breathing and chest tightness or pain. \nFor those with this allergy, it’s important to take steps to reduce the amount of pet dander in the home. You can do this by regularly bathing your pet, vacuuming the floor and furniture, changing and washing your bedding, and keeping your pet off of furniture and out of your bedroom. 3. Mold \nMold is a class of fungus that grows in damp places. It can grow almost anywhere that is warm, damp and humid environments like basements or bathrooms as well as in grass or mulch. \nThis fungus reproduces via spores and these spores can be present in the air, too. When the spores make their way into your nasal cavity, they trigger an allergic reaction. Some symptoms of a mold allergy are sneezing, itching, a runny nose, eye irritation, a cough, congestion, post-nasal drip and asthma attack. \nThose living in a house with poor ventilation and high humidity are more likely to have problems with mold. To help prevent the growth of mold: Ventilate damp areas to reduce the moisture level. For example, use an exhaust fan in the bathroom while showering. Regularly clean damp areas in the bathroom, kitchen and around the house to prevent mold spores from developing. Use a dehumidifier in areas that feel humid or smell musty. Always clean the dehumidifier’s filters and coils regularly. Eliminate sources of excess moisture like leaky pipes or roof shingles. Keep drainage areas around your home clear. Get rid of moldy leaves or damp firewood in the yard. 4. House Dust Mites \nHouse dust mites are microscopic organisms that live in house dust. They feed on the dead skin cells that people shed regularly. Dust mites can survive in all climates and at most altitudes. \nAccording to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, about 20 million people in the U.S. are allergic to dust mites. \nA dust mite allergy can cause a wide range of signs and symptoms, including a runny or itchy nose, post-nasal drip, itchy skin, congestion, sinus pressure, watery eyes, a scratchy throat, coughing, swollen eyes, trouble sleeping, chest pain or tightness, difficulty breathing and shortness of breath . \nTo prevent allergic reactions to dust mites: Use allergen-proof bed covers on the mattress, box spring and pillows to prevent the allergens from getting into the beds. Wash all your beddings (sheets, pillowcases, blankets and bed covers) in hot water at least once a week. Dry them in a hot dryer or in natural sunlight during the summer months. Keep your house as free as possible of items that collect dust, such as stuffed animals, curtains and carpets. Vacuum your home on a regular basis. 5. Cockroaches \nThe creepy and crawling cockroaches that many people cannot even bear the sight of are another common trigger of allergic reactions. \nA kind of protein in their droppings, saliva and appendages is the troublesome allergen. If there are cockroaches in your home or workplace, you can inhale the protein. \nCommon symptoms of this type of allergy include coughing, nasal congestion, a skin rash, wheezing and an ear or sinus infection. Cockroaches can also trigger asthma attacks as well as coughing and wheezing in babies and small children. \nThese creepy insects are notoriously hardy and difficult to get rid of. However, you can prevent an infestation by: Not leaving human or pet food sitting out for them to feed on. Covering trashcans, washing your dishes and cleaning up food crumbs promptly. Sealing cracks in your walls and floors. Fixing or cleaning up sources of excess moisture. Reducing humidity in your home, as it promotes the growth of cockroaches and other pests. Using roach traps or gels to get rid of cockroaches. 6. Food \nYou suffer from a food allergy if your immune system reacts abnormally to something you eat or drink. According to the Food Allergy Research and Education organization, some 15 million Americans have food allergies. \nWhen it comes to food allergies, there are some common foods that are known to be the main culprits. These include cow’s milk, eggs, peanuts, fish, shellfish, tree nuts (such as cashews or walnuts), wheat and soy. \nA food allergy can cause mild or severe symptoms. Mild symptoms may include sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, watery eyes, swelling, a rash, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. On the other hand, severe symptoms are difficulty breathing, wheezing, hives and dizziness. \nTo prevent allergic reactions, avoid problematic foods even in small amounts. Also, when purchasing food at a supermarket or ordering food in a restaurant, check the ingredients thoroughly.
