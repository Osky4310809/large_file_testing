He showed up for the coin toss and let’s just say it was pretty awesome. \nBush 41 is an American hero by every metric. The guy has a resume that just can’t be matched. \nHe has also had some pretty serious health problems and the fact he was able to make it to the game was really impressive. \nA recent report shed some light on Bush 41’s frame of mind when he was discharged from the hospital and apparently he was singing himself back to health during the last few hours of his hospital stay. \nFrom Washington Examiner : \nHis spokesman told Secrets that as Bush recovered last week, he had a different attending doctor, internist Dr. Amy Mynderse. Her name stuck in Bush’s mind. \nAnd on the day he felt good enough to leave, Jan. 30, when she came for a final visit, the president began serenading her with Frank Sinatra’s “Once in Love with Amy.” \nLove it. \nBush 41 is a class act no matter how you slice it. \nGuess what a lot of liberals did during the Super Bowl? \nMercilessly mocked the former president for being so frail. \nLiberals are great aren’t they?
