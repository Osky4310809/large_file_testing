By: FE Online | Published: March 11, 2017 10:03 AM This kind of victory comment come in the wake of the massive election campaign that Prime Minister Narendra Modi carried out in the state. (IE) \nUttar Pradesh Election Results 2017: With the counting of votes having started for UP, Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) state party leader Keshav Prasad Maurya met the media and indicated his confidence in capturing power massively and not just dethroning Samajwadi Party and its Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow, he went on to indicate that he expects a wave of his MLAs winning and giving him the kind of powerful victory that will virtually leave the opposition in tatters. With BJP leading in 133 seats, SP and Congress alliance in 33 seats and Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP in third place with 26), a clearly ecstatic Maurya said, “We are winning with 2/3rd majority, SP and BSP will be wiped out.” This kind of victory comment come in the wake of the massive election campaign that Prime Minister Narendra Modi carried out in the state. He in fact focussed his attention the most on India’s largest state as it has immense ramifications to decide the future of India (through UP polls triumph, he is eyeing a takeover in Rajya Sabha in Parliament eventually too, where the BJP is in a minority and the NDA government is not being able to effect the kind of reforms PM wants at the Centre because Congress and other parties are playing spoilsport.) \nWhile the PM has been catching eye-balls in his many rallies and through his volatile and catchy comments from ‘Kabristan’ to ‘Shamshaan’ and more, also helping the BJP cause was that the SP was not able to deliver the kind of economic development that the people think Modi can if BJP party comes to power. PM Modi has made big moves at the Centre to get the Indian economy into high gear and the UP electorate may well be hoping he pulls off the same kind of trick in the state that has massive potential but has not been able to bring that clout in reality as successive government’s were either caught in corruption allegatioons or were not able to effect the kind of out-of-the-box policies that would put it at the forefront of development. Also, the SP parivar that saw Akhilesh Yadav take power over from his father Mulayam in a virtual coup, left many SP supporters disenchanted. Yadav tried to project himself as a gung-ho young leader intent on development, yet the people do not seem to have bought his words. \nAlso watch this: http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress/?fref=nf \nPM Modi, as well as the BJP, have been able to project themselves as being above caste and regionalism even though they have a saffron background and talk of Ram temple is just beneath the surface for its leaders. This kind of voting wave for BJP is courtesy PM Modi’s clarion call for ‘Saabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’. He has said that his party and governments in states will never cater to parochial and narrow interests. Now, with the results in Uttar Pradesh going BJP way, PM may well have to deliver on his big promises and do that quickly and efficiently. \nEXIT POLLS PREDICTION IN UTTAR PRADESH (Total seats 402) DONE \nIn Uttar Pradesh the BJP under PM Narendra Modi and party President Amit Shah is expected to get a whopping majority according to most exit polls.
