By Erin Strout Friday, March 10, 2017, 2:16 pm Rob Krar gets iced down by his crew around mile 80 of the 2015 Western States Endurance Run. It ended up being his second consecutive victory there. Photograph courtesy of Erin Strout \nWhen Rob Krar asked me to be a member of his crew for his first 100-mile race at the 2013 Western States Endurance Run , I didn’t even think about it. I have a college degree, how hard could this possibly be? Never mind that I had yet to attend any event longer than 26.2 miles, I was in. See you in Squaw , as they say (in reference to the starting line in Squaw Valley, California). \nBut what I didn’t account for is that supporting somebody running 100 miles requires driving 250 miles on remote dirt roads to far-flung aid stations where GPS and cell phones don’t work, when it’s 105 degrees outside and the car’s air conditioning goes kaput halfway through. It’s lugging heavy coolers and chairs two miles down a canyon, waiting hours in places that feel like the surface of the sun so you can enthusiastically greet your uncommunicative athlete for approximately 90 seconds, then dragging all that gear back up to the car, only to pack and unpack it five more times before the finish.

This person placed enough trust in me to be part of a massive, meaningful goal. The adventures and misadventures that happened along the way remain the fodder of countless dinnertime conversations. \n“There’s nothing better than when you get that hug from your runner at the finish line,” says John Trent, an ultrarunner in his own right and a member of the Western States board of directors. “I have yet to crew for a runner who hasn’t felt like you have done something noble and gracious for them.” \nI don’t always teem with graciousness, but I’ve been a crew member for Krar several times since that first 100 miles, where he placed second. He went on to win Western States two consecutive years thereafter and those were some of the sweetest finish lines of my life, I’ll admit. He may be an expert at running long distances super fast, but me ? I can mix sports drinks and whip up an ice pack like no other. \nHere’s what I know about how to crew, with input from a few other veterans in the sport. \nPlan for the unexepected. A lot of unanticipated events can unfold during the course of an ultramarathon. Crew people are able to remain calm and adjust on the fly when they feel most prepared. It’s critical to have some honest conversations with the runner in advance of the big day about his or her primary goals, what challenges might pop up, and an exhaustive account of what items may or may not be needed. \nWhile it’s good to know what general timeframe the runner expects to hit every crewing station, it’s also helpful to have an idea of what a bad day might look like. For 100 miles, the fastest runners could finish in 15 hours or so, depending on the type of course. The back of the pack can be out there for 30 hours. And sometimes the people in between wind up running much longer than they hoped they would. Plan for the dark of night, temperature fluctuations, increased fueling needs, and potentially a lack of sleep (or even a nap—never leave home without sleeping bags). \nJust be willing to roll with it, preferably with a smile on your face. \n“When I organize a crew I want people who will find humor in the absurdity of it all,” Trent says. “It’s just part of the deal.” \nMake lists, study maps, and know the rules. Your runner should come up with detailed lists of what he or she might want at every crewing station, be it snacks, gels, drinks, new socks, a change of shoes, a headlamp, a jacket—whatever that phase of the race may dictate. Nobody can be too “Type A” when preparing for an ultra race. Talk about how the runner wants all of these things presented upon arrival. Some people want everything ready to go in a new pack that you simply hand off. Others like stuff laid out on a towel so they can see the options. Some runners like to sit down and linger. Others are all about efficiency—in and out without a lot of fuss. \nNo detail is too small to talk about prerace and write down. \n“I remember one race my crew kept handing me bottles in the wrong direction—I couldn’t grip them correctly that way,” says Ian Torrence, a coach and race director who has more than 200 ultramarathon finishes to his name. “At 80 miles I just threw the bottle down and said ‘I’m too tired! Stop handing me these stupid bottles the wrong way!’” \nMaterials should also include written directions to the aid stations, hardcopy maps, and the important rules. Pay attention to parking policies and where you’re allowed to aid your runner (usually within a certain distance of an aid station). Supporters never want to be the cause of a runner’s disqualification. \n“Crews should look at all the information available on the race website before race day,” Torrence says. “Don’t trust a GPS—know the distances between destinations and road names. I see a lot of people relying on the person driving in front of them. Don’t do that—they probably don ’ t know where they ’ re going either.” \nStay focused and keep track of time. Torrence says the No. 1 mistake rookie crews make usually comes at an early juncture in an ultra: the start. \n“I see people thinking they have a more time than they do so they go get coffee or breakfast and miss their runner at the first station, which is a really crappy precedent for the rest of the race,” he says. \nAnd even if you have a split crew—meaning one group is covering half the stations and another is manning the remainder—you have to stay on task in case your services are needed elsewhere. Torrence remembers helping his friend Hal Koerner, who’s won Western States, Hardrock Hundred, and others, at Western States. After leaving him in a pacer’s hands at mile 80, Torrence decided to get something to eat. \n“I went to get pizza and relax, then we decided to head to another aid station to cheer him on,” Torrence says. “He got there and he had lost his pacer, so he actually needed me. You really have to be engaged the whole time—you were invited to do this and it’s a responsibility.” \nPlan for self care and have a mother hen. During my first crewing experience I was so hyper-focused on Krar’s needs that I spent 15 hours, 22 minutes, and five seconds forgetting to hydrate or fuel myself. It was the second-hottest Western States on record—one aid station recorded 107 degrees Fahrenheit that day. The good news was that Krar was just fine by the end, all of us having paid monumental attention to his fluid intake throughout the day. Me? Not so much. I was dehydrated—not to mention famished. \nTrent suggests nominating one crew member to be the “mother hen.” That person is constantly asking the others if they’re eating, drinking, and taking care of themselves. He or she is wise to come up with a meal plan and have refreshments at the ready for the group. If the runner is going to be out there overnight, the crew ought to also consider taking turns napping. \n“While everybody else is thinking about the runner, this person is thinking about you,” Trent says. “You want to make sure the crew is sharp because at a certain point the crew functions as the brain for the runner. If you’re making dumb decisions, it melts into the runner’s performance.” \nBauer and I have gotten wiser over the years—half the cooler in the back of the car is filled with her homemade salads, drinks, and snacks reserved just for us. And, of course, the all-important cold brew coffee. Don’t underestimate the importance of caffeine in crewing. \nPack light and be familiar with the gear. Emily Harrison, an elite trail runner who lives in Flagstaff, Arizona, has crewed and been crewed for many times over the last few years. One thing she always asks of her team is that they understand the gear she uses, which helps make aid stations go more smoothly for everybody. \n“It’s important to be familiar with the nuances of any equipment the runner is using. If you don’t know how to fill a bladder in a hydration pack or how a particular bottle is unscrewed, it becomes frustrating,” she says. “I also like to show my crew where I want my [nutrition] products placed in my pack. As the race progresses, my brain function isn’t 100 percent anymore, so I like to know that my gel is always in the same pocket.” \nSeasoned ultrarunners also advise that crews and athletes carefully pick and choose what they really deem necessary to have on hand. Trent remembers the first time he ran an ultramarathon. His wife served as his crew, with his two young daughters in tow. It wasn’t until after they got home and she unloaded all the contents of the car that he realized how unnecessary much of it was. \n“The front yard looked like the Normandy Invasion,” he says. “Tents, coolers, blankets strewn all over. I wished that I had known we didn’t need all that stuff—it was so unfair to her to have to transport it around.” \nKnow when to give a runner tough love—and when not to. The moment that any crew member fears is the one in which a runner suggests it’s time to drop out of the race. Deciding whether to encourage that person to keep moving forward or to enable the athlete to give up can be agonizing. \n“I always say that if you can find a crew person who’s in the nursing field, it’s phenomenal because they are the gold standard in terms of their ability to handle anything,” Trent says. “They take care of people in distress every day and get them to function again at a high level. Lacking a nurse, a social worker is the next best thing—they know how to bring assets and resources into play to help somebody.” \nHarrison and Torrence, who are getting married this spring and have helped each other through dozens of ultras, have dealt with many scenarios in which one or the other hit low points. \n“Usually we tell each other to buck up. I tell Emily in the late stages of a race that it sucks because she’s running 100 miles,” Torrence says. “She also knows that when I want to lie down, it’s okay. I’ll get up. She doesn’t panic.” \nThe most important aspect of negotiating the dark moments is to try to decipher whether the runner is struggling with an injury or just a bad patch of physical and mental fatigue. If it’s the latter, it’s time to give some tough love or your best motivational speech and force the runner back out on the trail. If you’re at an impasse with your athlete, bring in third-party help. \n“It can get emotional and dealing with the decision is the single-biggest dilemma you can have as a crew,” Trent says. “If you have to, punt. Go get an aid station captain to evaluate and give perspective. They’ll tell the runner if they’re just being wimpy or that they should drop out.” \nHave fun. Hopefully this tip comes naturally, but crewing can indeed provide some of the grandest running adventures in some of the most breathtaking parts of the world, often only accessible by foot. All those hours spent waiting for runners to arrive are also an excellent opportunity to meet new people—Western States feels more like a family reunion each year we go back. And although I have not been enticed to try an ultra myself yet, it is a front-row seat to what it takes to tackle the challenge. \n“It’s a good time to learn and see it without going through it yourself,” Torrence says. “You see people beaten up and spit out who still somehow make it to the finish line.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T05:21:06.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
