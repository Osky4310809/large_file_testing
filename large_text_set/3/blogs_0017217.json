Underneath all that blue paint, we can hardly tell who‚Äôs channeling the Blue Man Group here‚Ä¶ kidding ! Nina and her girl squad took to Instagram to show off their hilarious face masks yesterday , dubbing themselves as the ‚ÄúBlue (wo)Man Group.‚Äù And as you can probably guess, whenever Nina and her crew are involved in an impromptu Instagram shoot , the results were absolutely hysterical.\nIn the first of the slew of snapshots, the actress and her pals sported GlamGlow‚Äôs new Sonic the Hedgehog face masks while piled on top of each other to pose with an equally blue pool.\nBlue (wo)Man Group. \nA post shared by Nina Dobrev (@nina) on Mar 18, 2017 at 3:39pm PDT \nThe XXX: Return of Xander Cage star didn‚Äôt exactly limit the mask‚Äôs health benefits to just her face. Nope, instead, she used the leftover mask to paint on some gnarly blue abs of steel, captioning the funny shot: ‚ÄúSame abs. Different effort.‚Äù\nSame abs. Different effort. #paintedbypicasso \nA post shared by Nina Dobrev (@nina) on Mar 18, 2017 at 4:27pm PDT \nThis peel-off mask is all the rage on Instagram right now, selling out on the Sephora app before it even officially launched back in January. Lucky for the former Vampire Diaries star and her besties, it seems they didn‚Äôt have any trouble scoring the nutrient-packed, color changing mud mask.\nBlue-fballs ü§£ \nA post shared by Nina Dobrev (@nina) on Mar 18, 2017 at 3:51pm PDT \nNina‚Äôs practically the queen of the Instagram girl squad (no offense, TSwift), and is always showcasing her girl gang‚Äôs adventures at places like Coachella, Joshua Tree, and Hawaii. And if you look very closely (and behind the blue paint), you‚Äôll note fellow CW star Danielle Campbell of The Originals is also a member of Nina‚Äôs girl tribe.\nA bunch of girls (and mark) got together for a BBQ... this is what followed... check the Insta story #BlueBBQ \nA post shared by Nicole Cogan (@nobread) on Mar 18, 2017 at 5:30pm PDT \nWhile these Blue Man-perfect masks no doubt make for a great selfie opportunity, they‚Äôre also packed with skin-nourishing ingredients like algae extracts, Icelandic kelp, and hyaluronic acid. And if you‚Äôre willing to shell out a cool $70 , you too can have Nina-perfect skin (and faux abs!).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:20:46.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
