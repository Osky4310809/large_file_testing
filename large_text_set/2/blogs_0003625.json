Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chair of the House oversight committee, has said he wants no part of the probe. Ohio's GOP secretary of state, Jon Husted, has dismissed the need for it. And the bipartisan umbrella group for state election officials has said it knows of no evidence to support Trump's fraud claims. \nNumerous studies have shown conclusively that, though there are rare cases of illegal voting, systemic voter fraud simply doesn't exist. \nThe White House may simply be waiting until Sen. Jeff Sessions is confirmed as attorney general, since he'd likely oversee the probe. Voting rights advocates, meanwhile, have expressed concern that a seemingly unwarranted federal voter fraud investigation would simply lay the groundwork to enact strict new voting laws and policies that end up keeping large numbers of would-be voters from the polls. President Trump expressed staunch support for such laws on the campaign trail , and stoked fears of a \"rigged\" election in the last weeks of his campaign when it was not clear that he would prevail. \nIn a tweet on October 17, he declared that there's \"large-scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,\" an substantiated claim he would repeat after winning the election (though not the popular vote) on Twitter and then make again months later as president. \nIn January, he used his first official meeting with congressional leaders at the White House to falsely claim that 3 to 5 million \"illegals\" voted, costing him the popular vote. Trump, who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes to Democrat Hillary Clinton, still has not offered any proof. \nRelated: Who Is Gregg Phillips, the Man Trump Name-Checked to Prove Voter Fraud? \nOne nightmare scenario of launching a federal investigation into already debunked claims of voter fraud, voting rights advocates say, would be an effort to pass a federal law requiring documentary proof of citizenship for anyone registering to vote â€” effectively a nationwide voter ID requirement for voter registration that makes it all but impossible to conduct community registration drives. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the architect of such a law in his state and a close Trump ally, said this week he's advised Trump to investigate fraud. \nThe Justice Department could also try to force purges of voter rolls, using a provision of federal voting law requiring states to keep their rolls up to date. In the past, such purges conducted by state and local election officials have often removed eligible voters. \n\"I expect the Trump civil rights division to bring suits under that provision in places with large minority, youth, or other Democratic-leaning populations,\" Samuel Bagenstos, a former top civil rights division official during the Obama administration, wrote recently. \"The goal of these lawsuits will be to trim the voting rolls.\" Play", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:51:30.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
