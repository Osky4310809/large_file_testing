About five mice per hectare would be considered normal, Mr Henry said. \nMouse plagues regularly occur only in Australia's grain belts and a province in north-west China, the CSIRO said. Threat to farms \nVictoria and South Australia occupy a large part of the Murray-Darling Basin, a fertile region accounting for almost 40% of Australia's agricultural income, according to the government . \nOutbreaks of mice create a significant financial hit to farmers who are forced to buy costly bait and often re-sow crops. \nMr Henry said plague conditions also led to stress in rural communities. \n\"It's the fact that they are invading people's houses, they're in their vehicles, everywhere they turn around there's a mouse,\" he said. \n\"People in the cities are aghast when they have a mouse in the house. These people in the country, they're jamming up every crack in their house with steel wool to stop the mice from getting in.\" \nMice were introduced to Australia by European settlers. They have few natural predators and face little competition from native wildlife.
