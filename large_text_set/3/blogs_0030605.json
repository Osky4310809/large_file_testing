Arianna Huffington, the cofounder and editor in chief of The Huffington Post, is that businesswoman. And for good reason. In 2007, Arianna experienced a major wake-up call: she literally broke a cheekbone when she fell asleep at her desk from lack of sleep and being overworked. The moment inspired a rethinking of her priorities and the understanding that being successful begins with fundamentals, like sleep.\nThe passion for zzz's and research into the science of sleep led to her new book, The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life One Night at a Time .\nI interviewed Arianna about how to achieve success and work-life balance, and she listed sleep as the top priority. Otherwise, \"everything becomes transactional. You go through the motions — you go to your meetings, you get your to-do list. There's no joy and there's no real creativity.\" Arianna believes in this approach so deeply The Huffington Post now has nap pods you can book throughout the day for a rest — whenever you need it.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://api.shopstyle.com/action/apiVisitRetailer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB011G3HC0U%2Fref%3Ddp-kindle-redirect%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26btkr%3D1&pid=popsugar&pdata=843889", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/QCJZOZTovhvuGrmeSiYC4esa3Q4/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/07/13/126/n/1922441/d8f59f57b130a9a7_GettyImages-522346142.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-26T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T08:09:02.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
