Dudu Rochatec \nFreshly leaked images of what is purported to be Lenovo's upcoming Moto G5 show what appears to be a metal body and suggest it will feature a removable battery. \nThe handset, which is expected to debut later this month at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, was shown in the hands-on images shared by Portuguese tech site Dudu Rochatec running Android 7.0 Nougat. The images also show the handset sporting a physical home button below the display as well as the familiar \"M\" logo on the back. \nLenovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe Moto G5 is expected to have a 5-inch screen, according to a leak earlier this month, while its larger companion, the G5 Plus, will have a larger 5.2-inch display. Both are also said to feature Snapdragon octa-core processors and Android 7.0 Nougat. \nCNET will be on the ground at MWC 2017 when Lenovo officially debuts these phones, so check back often for more info. \nVirtual reality 101 : CNET tells you everything you need to know about what VR is and how it'll affect your life. \nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech stuff is cool.
