Democracy means every day.” \n“You know, we still have a constitution. We still have organizations. We still have rights,” he continued. “We still get a chance to express ourselves. \nJones noted that when House “Republicans said, ‘we’re going to throw the ethics out. We don’t have no more ethics.’ Guess what, Democrats and Republicans, people, citizens, ordinary people stood up and said no and they said, ‘never mind right away.'” \n“It showed the power of the people, not just politicians. If you like or don’t like the president you still have a responsibility to participate.” Donald Trump (Getty Images) \nJones added that while filming his special, he “talked to African-American mothers in Detroit.” \n“Hillary Clinton lost the whole state of Michigan by only 10,000 votes,” he continued. “There was 100,000 people in Detroit alone who came out in 2012 who didn’t come out for Hillary… and there was literally an African-American woman who did not vote for Hillary because she’s a woman, and my brain just came oozing out.” \nJones reiterated that political conversations have “gotten so particular polarized and the whole discussion is ‘you’re right, I’m wrong.’ I can never be on TV and just say, ‘I didn’t know that. You’re correct, Mr. Republican.” \n“You can’t say that. I have to be right all the time, so we decided let’s do a show where we can have surprise, confession and discovery together and not always put people into a box.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T18:11:58.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
