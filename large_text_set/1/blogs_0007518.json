King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 14 hours ago 11 Megadeth bassist David Ellefson admitted he finds it unsettling that the band's finest music was released during the days of their heaviest drug abuse.He tells My Global Mind : \"I think the end came for us in 1989 - a very dark year. The band had splintered, management had splintered, and Capitol Records sat idle waiting for us to get our act together.\"Ironically, we wrote one of our fan-favorite records, ' Rust in Peace ,' during that time. What's interesting is that in another dark and tumultuous time we managed to write another one of fan favorites - ' Peace Sells... But Who's Buying ' - just a few years earlier.\"What starts to trouble you as an artist is you realize that in your darkest days you wrote your best music. There's always a looming call to go back to it so you can recapture it.\"Unfortunately, as a human being, you can't operate under that premise. What made 'Rust in Peace' so successful was that we wrote the record in a very dark time but got clean and sober and recorded it stone-cold sober. Then we went out and were able to tour to bring the band to even greater success with sober judgment.\"Even with ' Dystopia ,' it was a record written in a dark time in the band's career with lineup and management changes. All these sorts of things turning around in the camp I think in a weird way it created this disturbance 'within' that created this terrific music for 'without.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T10:02:00.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
