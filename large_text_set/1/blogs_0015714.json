Lithium is a strategic mineral given its importance in modern technologies. \n“If the team at Cornish Lithium is successful in developing this opportunity the UK may not have to rely on imports of this vital mineral in future.” \nThe company will explore a large area centred on the traditional mining areas of Camborne, Redruth and St Day. It puts the cost of this exploration phase at £5m and is looking for investors. Negotiations are ongoing with other owners of mineral rights within Cornwall. \nThe majority of lithium comes from South America, Australia and China. The company intends to extract lithium through drill holes and has also secured rights to geothermal energy contained in the hot springs. \nIt is anticipated that this energy will be utilised to generate power to reduce processing costs, but also may be used for other industries in the region.

Prof Kip Jeffrey, the head of Camborne School of Mines, said: “Although this project is still at an early stage it is very exciting news. \n“If successful, it will be good for the whole of Cornwall and I believe will also have wider potential implications for the whole of the UK. \nLithium was recently described as “the new gasoline” by a Goldman Sachs expert because of its use in batteries for electric vehicles . It is abundant but difficult to get to but its lightness makes it attractive to carmakers. \nIt is thought the presence of high levels of lithium in the Cornish springs is due to the interaction between highly saline water from a nearby sedimentary basin and the granite under Cornwall. \nSome of the granite rocks in Cornwall are enriched in lithium and, over millions of years, this lithium appears to have become dissolved in the waters that have interacted with the granite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T13:10:36.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
