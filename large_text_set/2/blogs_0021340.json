We believe there is no best country, best gender, bet religion or best color. We want this award to stand as a symbol of the unity between nations and the freedom of the arts.” \nThe statement was signed by Asghar Farhadi, Martin Zandvliet, Hannes Holm, Maren Ade, Martin Butler, and Bentley Dean. The directors dedicated the award for which they are nominated to, “all the poeple, artists, journalists and activists who are working to foster unity and understanding, and who uphold freedom and expression and human dignity.” You can read the full statement here . \nWhen Donald Trump—who, after five weeks, remains our dangerously egomaniacal president—signed a travel ban on some predominantly Muslim countries in January, many outlets reported the Farhadi, an Iranian director and one of the letter’s signatories, would not be permitted to attend the Oscars. Farhadi quickly responded that he wouldn’t attend the Oscars even if he could.

The AP’s reporting, based in part on an internal Trump administration correspondence, found that the last-minute ban was implemented because U.S. officials discovered “derogatory information” about Khateeb.
