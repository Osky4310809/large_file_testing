The material he was filming was promoted and distributed Thursday via ISIS Telegram channels. London-based bus driver Abu Haleema, an associate of extremist Anjem Choudary, was arrested in spring 2015 by Scotland Yard; he'd warned in a video two months before that \"we’re going to see the black flag of sharia in the White House, we’re going to see the black flag of sharia over Windsor castle, we’re going to see the black flag of the khilafah on the Suez Canal.\" He was freed on bail -- on the condition that he stop stoking jihad through his active YouTube, Facebook and Twitter accounts. “Officers from the counter-terrorism command SO15 arrested a 37-year-old man in a west London street on suspicion of encouragement of terrorism contrary to Section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2006,\" British law enforcement officials said at the time. “He was taken to a central London Police Station and has since been bailed to a date in mid-June pending further enquiries. The man was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.” Early this year, Abu Haleema turned his focus to stoking jihad in Australia , with videos attacking more moderate Muslim leaders, including one who issued a fatwa confirming Australian Muslims can join the police and military. He was featured in a January documentary, The Jihadis Next Door , released by Britain's Channel 4. Abu Haleema told the filmmaker that he wanted to re-create ISIS videos in London, including throwing gays off tall buildings and stoning to death adulterers on Haven Green in Ealing, West London. He's considered to be one of those leading the Islamic extremist movement in the UK left behind by Siddartha Dhar when he went to the Islamic State and became their new English-speaking \"Jihadi John\" executioner. In the documentary, Abu Haleema and Mohammed Shamsuddin laugh and joke while watching an ISIS execution video during dinner. In the video released Monday, Abu Haleema speaks on a nighttime street, illuminated by the lights of a parking lot across the way. He begins by rattling off verses from the Quran. \"What are we seeing now? We've seen this five years now the war's been happening in Syria, five years now the people have been trying to liberate themselves from the kuffar [disbelievers],\" he said in his belligerent, rapid-fire style. \nhttps://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2016/03/31/british-extremist-films-pro-jihad-screed-on-open-street-with-passers-by/", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:36:55.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
