Two different challenges that we face with the same goal in our minds: winning both of them.

Most of them have been good wins that made us happy, although we've also got several draws that were not so easy to take. \n\"It happened on Saturday at Stoke, where we added one point at the end thanks to a great free-kick goal from Wayne. I want to congratulate Wayne once again. \n\"He's become the top goalscorer in the history of the club and I'm so happy for him. I'm sure that he will keep scoring many more goals and improving his amazing stats.

We created chances to get the three points and it makes us mad to see that the ball just doesn't go in. \n\"It's especially frustrating when you're so unlucky as to score an own goal, when you're trying precisely to avoid that. \n\"Anyway, this is football and, as always, we have to stay determined and motivated, and carry on.\" poll loading Who will win the EFL Cup? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T19:23:49.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
