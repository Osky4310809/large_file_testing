This is about our values,” said one mother with her child.

They also praised mayors of sanctuary cities in the Commonwealth. \n“Even though you can ban our brothers and sisters from entering the country, you cannot ban the souls that will rise up against it,” another speaker said. \nThey also called for support of recently-filed state legislation, called the Massachusetts Safe Communities Act , that would ensure due process rights to people detained for civil immigration violations and ensure police don’t participate in immigration enforcement. \n“We call on our governor, Charlie Baker, to take a bold stand against the myriad orders from the Trump administration, threatening the safety and well-being of so many in our state,” one of the religious leaders said. People from congregations and groups across the state say they are part of a solidarity network, “Sanctuary Congregations”. pic.twitter.com/3k0pqimjQU \n— KarynRegal (@Karynregal) January 31, 2017 \n“Our message is this: These bills must be fast-tracked. To the governor, our message is clear. Stand with us in support and sign the Safe Communities Act and speak a resounding ‘no’ to Massachusetts becoming a Trump state,” said the Rev. Cody Sanders of Cambridge. \nA rally in support of the Massachusetts Safe Communities Act is planned for noon Wednesday at the State House. \nEarly Tuesday afternoon, Gov. Baker’s press secretary Billy Pitman released a statement on the Safe Communities Act. \n“Governor Baker opposes the recent executive order as it puts our global community and economy at risk, will not improve our security, and lacks the guidance associated with such an abrupt and overwhelming decision that is problematic for all involved. The administration plans to share our concerns with the federal government this week and has worked with the Attorney General’s office in support of her challenging this action today. Governor Baker does not support a sanctuary state,” Pitman said.
