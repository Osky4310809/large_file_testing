Sadly, April's still carrying her little one and it's unknown when she'll actually give birth.\nRelated: Report Reveals Giraffes Are Officially 'Vulnerable' To Extinction \nStill, it doesn't mean things aren't progressing along for the giraffe. On Sunday, April's zookeepers took to Facebook to give a labor update to her many fans. Alongside the pic (above), the Animal Adventure Park 's employees wrote: \n\"Keeper report is 'holy smokes' baby is sticking out. It is very evident in visual observations that the calf is moving up and sticking out! All are happy with progress, we are not in labor at this time.\"\nBummer. The crew continued:\n\"Temperatures are warming and snow is melting. We hope to have the giraffes outside soon! Excitingly - a new batch of enrichment items should be arriving tomorrow and will be installed for viewer enjoyment! Hope all had a great weekend and we look forward to another week and hopefully the arrival of our long awaited calf.\"\nUg . We can only imagine how badly April wants to give birth right now!\nNonetheless, we're glad the zookeepers are playing it safe with the updates as there have been enough false alarms so far. Although, we have a gut feeling that April will give birth any day now, as the zookeepers noted during their Sunday morning update:\n\"Keepers have noted a calming down of the calf and April carrying everything a bit towards the rear. This is exactly what we want! Wax caps are still in place. Appetite remains strong.\"\nHowever, we're not zoologists by any means, so don't hold us to our prediction.
