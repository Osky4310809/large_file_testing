Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view – NO FEDERAL FUNDS?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \nMilo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to speak at the university after being invited by the Berkeley College Republicans. A statement released by the university said “about 150 masked agitators” had interrupted “an otherwise non-violent” protest and the university police had therefore decided to cancel the event. Yiannopoulos wrote on his Facebook page that “violent left-wing protestors tore down barricades.”\nBerkeley received approximately $370 million for research in federal funding from 2015-2016, according to the university website. Yiannopoulos, a Trump supporter who styles himself as promoting free speech, was barred from Twitter last year for his role in inciting harassment against Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones. Yiannopoulos is a senior editor at Breitbart, the website where Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon made his name.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:35:53.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
