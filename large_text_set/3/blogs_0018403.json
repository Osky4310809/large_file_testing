No coffee while they wait now.

Poor you, how will you cope???\n— Kieran (@sh0utatthemoon) March 21, 2017 \nCan we talk about the real issue today which is Waitrose is dropping their free coffee #what #peoplewillrevolt #freecoffeenomore \n— Madalena de Lellis (@madalenaaaa) March 21, 2017 \n\nMartin Lane, Managing Editor of money.co.uk said: ‘I’m sure this will have many loyal Waitrose customers up in arms as the famous freebie has become a firm favourite with shoppers. Paying customers can still get free tea and coffee so long as they buy something. This could be a good thing for genuine punters doing their weekly food shop and might stop some people who cheekily nip in for a regular freebie without buying anything.\n‘For genuine customers, nothing really changes – it’s only the freeloaders who will suffer so it’s win win for the Waitrose tribe.’\nIt comes after the supermarket also changed its free newspaper offer, meaning shoppers now have to spend a minmium of £10 to benefit.\nIt'll be the free coffee next! ☕ Another cut to supermarket loyalty card perks #waitrose #newspapers @MoneyFightClub @PRVix pic.twitter.com/OHCEDX0Y43 \n— Georgie Frost (@GECFrost) October 18, 2016 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:05:23.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
