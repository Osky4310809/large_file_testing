The diner’s oven vent was tilted and near collapse, and the roof was completely gone. The building was declared a total loss. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. \nOne visitor said Framingham had plenty of chains, but family restaurants like this needed to be saved. J&M Diner was among the buildings destroyed by a Framingham fire.

It’s just a building, but a big part of my life,” St. Hilaire said. \nNow her Styles & Smiles hair salon is nothing but a pile of rubble and her dreams and business gone up in flames. \n“To see this is just heart breaking,” St. Hiliare said. \nOn Sunday, David Mezzone returned to see J & M Diner gone. \n“My father and I have breakfast all the time. It’s a horrible thing to witness,” Mezzone said. \nFortunately, no was killed or injured but the pain runs deep. Jackie says her biggest concern is not her building but her customers. \n“Primarily children and special needs kids. I loved this place. This was my home away from home,” St. Hilaire said. \nMeanwhile, diner manager Olivia vowed to continue on despite the fire. \n“The diner fell,” she said. “We didn’t.” \nWBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Karyn Regal reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T02:00:54.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
