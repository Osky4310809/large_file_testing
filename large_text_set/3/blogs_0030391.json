Rob Havenstein to switch to guard, will Rams draft offensive lineman? By Bryan Kalbrosky 6 hours ago Follow @BryanKalbrosky 103 shares By: Bryan Kalbrosky | 6 hours ago Follow @BryanKalbrosky \nWhile the Los Angeles Rams were entirely unproductive at offensive line last season, it seems they will may look to the draft for help. \nLast season, Rodger Saffold was the most impressive and productive offensive lineman for the Rams. He played right guard and was a leadership presence for Los Angeles during the first season after relocation. \nThe Rams beefed up their offensive line when they added veteran a left tackle, Andrew Whitworth. Saffold will join Whitworth on the left side, which offers more reliable protection for Jared Goff. Related: \nAccording to a report from ESPN , the Rams will switch former No. 2 overall pick Greg Robinson to right tackle. Rob Havenstein, meanwhile, will jump to right guard. \nRams general manager Les Snead spoke about why Havenstein will make the jump: \n“He’s a very, very, very smart guy. Being inside, you have to be mentally agile in there, a lot more than you have to be at tackle. Things happen quicker, and ther are more options of who you block. Most of the time at tackle, it’s a very limited number of people based on what changes in a defense.” \nWhitworth, Saffold, Robinson and Havenstein make up four of the five positions for the Los Angeles offensive line. \nSnead also hinted about what the team plans to do at center, which is a missing link for the 2017 season: \n“The biggest key for us right now, because you do have a second-year QB, is whoever that player is has got to be mentally astute. You’d probably rather have a veteran who’s done it, at least a veteran mentor.” \nThe Rams made an offer sheet for Bills center Ryan Groy, who will instead remain with Buffalo. Groy had already played for new Rams offensive line coordinator Aaron Kromer for two different teams. \nLos Angeles also met with John Sullivan, who played under new Rams head coach Sean McVay in Washington in 2016. Related: John Sullivan can bring experience to protect Jared Goff, Todd Gurley \nWhile the Rams have not yet signed Sullivan, Gonzalaz reports that the team is still exploring “free agency and trades” for a center. \nHe estimates that Los Angeles has somewhere between $10 million and $12 million in available cap space, though $5 million will be used to pay the new rookie class. \nIt seems unlikely that they reach early for an offensive lineman during the draft. Instead, they may find one later as a sleeper project. \nLos Angeles has met with Chase Roullier from Wyoming, who brags experience at center and offensive guard. They have also interviewed offensive tackle Julie’n Davenport from Bucknell and. Not surprising, given where their issues lie, but pretty clear at this point: the Rams are expected to go heavy at WR and TE in the draft. \n— Alden Gonzalez (@Alden_Gonzalez) March 28, 2017 \nAccording to Tony Pauline , they spoke with offensive lineman Darrell Williams, Jr. from Western Kentucky and Northern Illinois guard Levon Myers . \nThe highest pick of any of those players, as projected by Bleacher Report’s Matt Miller , was Davenport in the fourth round. Experiments at offensive line may not be the best call for a troubling unit. \nInstead, Rams fans should expect rounds two and/or three to target a wide receiver or tight end and then find a starting center somewhere outside of the draft.
