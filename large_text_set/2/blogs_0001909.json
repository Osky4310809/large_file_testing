Specific products you can use included. UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 6 hours ago 7 \nA useful video guide has surfaced via Recording Revolution, explaining how you can build a solid home studio with just $350. \nMr. Graham explained: \"There are a lot of opinions [on the internet], and most of them are crazy! They will tell you that you need to spend lots and lots of money and that you need all kinds of complicated stuff. But the whole industry has changed! There's so much fantastic-sounding and accessible gear at rock-bottom prices. \n\"There has never been a better time to make music.\" \nYou can check out the list of products the dude picked in the rundown below, feel free to watch the video for the whole thing. 0) The computer you already have \n\"You don't need to buy a separate computer, that's ludicrous! Use the one you have and when you get good at this, then invest in yourself and get a dedicated computer for recording and mixing if you need it.\" 1) Audio Interface - Focusrite Scarlett Solo - $99 \n\"Scarlett Solo is one of the only budget interfaces that can record at high, high sample rate; sample rate that most pro interfaces record at. ... This is the most important part of your studio, and it's only $99.\" 2) Recording/mixing software - $0 \n\"What I love about the Scarlett Solo is that it comes with 2 free pieces of recording software - Ableton Live Lite and Pro Tools First.\" 3) Microphone - Samsone C01 - $79 \n\"Every home studio needs a large-diaphragm condenser microphone. These are great because they're very sensitive mics. They can capture vocals and all the details beautifully; they can capture acoustic guitars, they're great over a piano, they're great over a drum kit because they capture all the cymbals beautifully.\" 4) Studio headphones - KRK KNS6400 - $99 \n\"Just get a pair of headphones [instead of studio monitors] - then the room is out of the equation, you can work late at night, you can work if you have roommates or dogs or neighbors - so much benefit comes from headphones!\" 5) Mic XLR cable - $19 \n\"This is a standard microphone cable. You can get a 15-20-foot cable for around $20.\" 6) Microphone stand - $25 \n\"I prefer the tripod stand 'cause they're a little more stable, and you'll want a stand that's got a boom arm so you can position that microphone exactly the way you want.\" 7) Pop filter - $19 \n\"If you're going to record vocals, you'll need a pop filter.\"Total price: $340", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:52:51.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
