More choice \nSeems Google might play catch-up on some features, considering waterproofing the Pixel 2 though that has yet been confirmed. \nThe Pixel 2 will have a lot of attention paid to the camera, with even better low light capabilities. As for the processor, it could either be using Qualcomm's Snapdragon 83X chips or perhaps Intel's. Word is that MediaTek was also bandied about but dropped in favour of Qualcomm and Intel's chips. \nGoogle had also been experimenting with creating its own custom chipset but that might just be in testing and might not come to the Pixel 2. \nBad news: it might cost at least US$50 (S$75) more than the current model. \nAs for the cheaper phone model codenamed the Pixel 2B, it would be cheaper, have less high-end specs as well as being targetted to different markets. So perhaps Southeast Asia is a possible destination for the phone but it's likely Google might prioritise markets such as India and China. \nStill wondering if you want to fork out money for the current Pixel?
