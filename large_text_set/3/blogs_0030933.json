Previous reports have suggested that pre-orders for the Galaxy S8 might open in the first week of April, in some markets they might go live after the announcement tomorrow . \nIf you’re looking forward to pre-order the Galaxy S8 you might want to do that from one of our selected partners. That way you can get a special gift from SamMobile over and above any pre-order incentives that Samsung will offer with the Galaxy S8 . \nReaders based in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, India and Australia will receive a special gift from us if they pre-order Galaxy S8 from one of our partners that include Samsung itself, Amazon and mobile carriers. \nIs your country not on this list? Don’t worry, we’re trying to work with more partners to expand this pre-order incentive for the Galaxy S8 to more countries. We’ll update when more countries are added to the list. More information about this incentive will be revealed once the Galaxy S8 is officially announced and available for pre-order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:57:50.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
