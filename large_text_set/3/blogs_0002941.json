During his keynote presentation, Google Vice President of Engineering David Besbris said these partnerships “tremendously increase the reach of where AMP pages can go” and help fulfill the promise that publishers can build one file that works well on every distribution platform. \n“[AMP pages are] the same as the web,” Besbris said. “That’s not typically the case in the distribution platforms.” \nOther services that already support AMP include Bing, Pinterest and LinkedIn. In fact, Besbris said that on LinkedIn, AMP articles see a 10 percent increase in time spent reading compared to non-AMP articles.And he said Yahoo-owned Tumblr will be rolling out AMP support to all Tumblr blogs. \nBesbris also noted that while AMP was initially just for news stories, it has since expanded into other areas like e-commerce . He even showed off a messaging app built in AMP — not that that’s the project’s real purpose. (“It wasn’t intended to build applications, it was intended to build content sites.”) Still, it illustrates Besbris’ point that AMP can work with a number of different content types, not just static articles. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:09:36.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
