Although police chose not to name the gang, FOX 5 claims it is MS-13, which the victim’s mother confirmed in an interview. She told WUSA she brought her daughter from El Salvador to Gaithersburg, Md., trying to get her away from a gang. @CounterMoonbat Missed this on CNN too. \n— Frank atda Lake (@Ease_Private) February 16, 2017 @CounterMoonbat @RealSallyKonn these poor innocent dreamers.
