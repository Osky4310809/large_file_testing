Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com)   4:45pm Bryan Adams' “Go Up” World Tour marked the singer's third visit to Manila. Philstar.com/Efigenio Christopher Toledo IV \nMANILA, Philippines – Bryan Adams still has it. \nThe 57-year-old Canadian singer might have become a little wrinkled and old, but the same cannot be about his songs and vocal power. \nHis “Go Up” World Tour marked his third visit to Manila. The last one, he said, was about 20 years ago. \nDuring last night’s full house concert at the Araneta Coliseum, he made an international audience reminisce and sing along with his ‘90s hits that have become the soundtracks of some of Hollywood’s classics: \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" featured in Johnny Depp’s “Don Juan De Marco”, “All for Love” used in the ‘90s cult “The Three Musketeers”, and “(Everything I Do) I Do It For You“ that added wattage to Kevin Costner’s “Robin Hood”. Compositions such as these gave him nominations – three times for Academy Awards and five times for the Golden Globes. \n“All for Love”, \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" and “Heaven” were also listed in the US Billboard Hot 100 number one singles. \nLast night, Adams caught watchers by off-guard when he unceremoniously began singing “Heaven” right after a lesser known song. “Heaven” has been covered in different languages all over the world, including by “Asia’s Songbird” Regine Velasquez and Renz Verano, who claimed to be the “Bryan Adams of the Philippines” for his similar husky voice.   \nWatch Bryan Adams as he sings \"Heaven\" in Manila: \n\nBryan Adams in Manila singing Heaven \nTruly, there are a few artists in the world with unique and iconic voices, and Bryan is one of them. Last night, however, he let go of some of his signature huskiness and saved them for his classics like “Summer of ‘69” and “When You’re Gone”, originally a duet with former Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm. He showed more of his other facets: as a master guitar player with rippling and acrobatic riffs, and as a head-banging rock star with a good boy Rolling Stones kind of swag. \nNot only did he try to be relevant among today’s millennials through his more upbeat music, like his opening number, “Do What Ya Gotta Do” from his new album, “Get Up”. He also made sure he is socially wired by inviting fans from all over the world to submit their headshots in his Instagram and Facebook accounts. Thousands replied, and their photos were flashed as a video collage for Bryan’s giant screen backdrop. \nVideo collage made of headshots submitted by fans Philstar.com/Deni Rose M. Afinidad-Bernardo \n\n“A lot of people sent us the wrong ‘headshots’, so we cannot show these. But we still have them for our own private viewing,” quipped the recording icon, who injected some of his trademark sexiness into the concert, such as projecting a music video of a naked woman tattooed with his “Summer of ‘69” lyrics. \nIn a world drooling over YouTube, nothing beats the experience of seeing a live concert, with fans going gaga in their LED-lit bunny ears. \n\nMore scenes from last night's concert: \nThe backdrop big screen flashing Adams' new album cover for \"Get Up\".
