Given the ongoing war being waged by President Trump, against the Free Press, and his most recent deflections of attention away from matters that truly matter: i.e., the depth and extent of Russian meddling in our American democracy and any possible collusion (or motives for such) by Mr. Trump — we now run a serious risk of chasing the wrong stories, as well as reaching the wrong conclusions. T.A. Frank, writing for Vanity Fair, has offered up a compelling piece in that regard. He sets up the three most widely-accepted scenarios relative to the Jeff Sessions’ affair, then, goes on to objectively debunk all three and offer up an alternative narrative… “Originally, when writing this story, I intended to offer three hypotheses for what could have happened: (1) Sessions was colluding with Moscow and trying to hide it. (2) Sessions wasn’t colluding with Moscow, but he forgot about his meetings with Kislyak. (3) Sessions wasn’t colluding with Moscow, but decided to lie about contacts with Russians.” I find myself agreeing with much of what Mr. Frank says, as far as wrong motives being ascribed to Attorney General Sessions and his perjury before the Senate Armed Forces Committee. I won’t go nearly as far as Sen. Ted Cruz, in calling it a “nothing burger” because it’s always a big deal whenever someone, especially someone so intimately connected to the law and now, law enforcement either lies, evades, or offers up unsolicited testimony (Franken’s Q&A) which is shown — by facts — to be patently false. In watching (several times) this damning record of the confirmation hearing exchange, it strikes me that Mr. Sessions was prepared for a wholly different question , and simply blurted out his own, prepared denial to any anticipated accusations directed at him personally; failing to elaborate about any “other,” i.e., non-campaign related meetings he might have had with Ambassador Kislyak, which could well be seen as intentional evasion. Of the three original options offered up by Mr. Frank, in the Vanity Fair piece; I still tend to think #3 hits closest to the truth mark. But, I don’t think Jeff Sessions wittingly served as a go-between for Team Trump, relative to any Russian espionage or possible (i.e., not yet proven) collusion with them to influence the Presidential Election. Rather — as acknowledged by Steve Bannon — I see Sessions as Trump’s legal “ clearing house ” for various domestic policies designed to ethnically cleanse America of unwanted “hordes” of brown people and non-Christians, not as a useful co-conspirator in flirtations with Putin and possible treason. Moreover, I ascribe rather different motives to the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, a very savvy diplomat. I suspect it was a routine attempt to “fluff” a key confidant to then-candidate Trump and mine him for whatever useful human intelligence that might be gleaned from him, relative to current and future Russian policy interests, like Ukraine, which Sessions has acknowledged as coming up in the private meeting held in his Senate office. I also largely agree with noted Never-Trump Conservative, David Frum , as stated in recent appearances on MSNBC, i.e., that we run the foolish risk of chasing the Sessions story down a “rabbit hole” — which will lead us further away from that central issue: i.e., the threat to our democratic sovereignty and national security, rather than uncovering any real or damning evidence of collusion, and answer the logical ‘end question’ of possible impeachment of the President of the United States. Frum has also recently weighed-in on the whether there should be a “special prosecutor” or an “independent commission” (like the 9/11 Commission), taking the investigation from the Senate Intelligence Committee, or at least — augmenting it — given the already partisan actions of Committee Chairman, Richard Burr (R-NC), and similar concerns about Senate Judiciary Chairman, Chuck Grassley (R-IA), regarding the Jeff Sessions flap. Perhaps the most compelling bits of substance, in regard to answering the ‘impeachment question’ — or at least moving us in that direction — is the seedy ‘money trail’ of foreign entanglements between the Russian Oligarchs under Putin (now the richest man in the world), and the American President, as is set forth in this chilling segment (on topic) from a recent Rachel Maddow show… There, I continue to insist that we must “follow the money” e.g., all of the trips abroad by Trump team members (and family) and the curious case of Cyprus as being the repository of illicit BILLION$ stashed there by Russian oligarchs, with the able assistance of Trump’s new Commerce Secretary and others. Once again ,…Trump’s undisclosed tax returns remain as the one piece of critical, likely damning evidence against him. Unless and until they are released, and either fully reviewed by the appropriate committees or a commission; that mystery will continue to cloud any definitive proofs as to the true motives of Donald Trumps unabashed love affair with Vladimir Putin. And that cloud, one of deep suspicion and abject distrust of this president — still in the infancy of his term of office — will plague and undermine everything he says or does in the minds of most of the American People. ► President Obama responds to latest Trump accusation of “wiretapping”…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T21:56:13.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
