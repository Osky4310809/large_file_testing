Suppliers say the stay order is so that engineers can see how the two vehicles are able to share parts and elements with Nissan models, Automotive News reports. \nThe new Outlander was slated to be launched sometime in the first quarter of 2019, with the replacement for the third-gen ASX due to arrive in 2020. Now, word is that the introduction of former has been pushed back to late 2019 or early 2020, and the new ASX won’t see the light of day until 2021. \nAccording to a supplier, development of both models have been halted as the automaker and Nissan look to find ways to share components and underpinnings, the ASX with the Nissan Qashqai (known as the Rogue Sport in the US) and the Outlander, with the X-Trail (the Rogue in the US). The idea is to standardise elements hidden away from sight in a bid to cut costs. \nThe completion of Nissan’s purchase of a 34% stake in Mitsubishi last year saw the mention of Nissan and MMC cooperating on a wide-ranging synergy of programmes, including joint purchasing and plant localisation as well as common vehicle platforms and technology sharing in a bid to reduce costs. \nPlatform sharing and co-development have of course been bandied – there’s talk of the Alliance consolidating all its electric vehicle platforms , and there is a possibility that the next-generation Nissan NP300 Navara and Mitsubishi Triton could share the same underpinnings and tech , albeit with their own distinct styling.
