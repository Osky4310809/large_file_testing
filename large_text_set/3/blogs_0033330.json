REUTERS/Marco Bello MARCO BELLO / Reuters \n\"We call for the government of Venezuela to permit the democratically-elected National Assembly to perform its constitutional functions, hold elections as soon as possible and to release all political prisoners,\" Toner stated. \nU.S. Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Bob Menendez, D-N.J. issued a joint statement Thursday evening calling the power grab \"an attack on what remained of democratic institutions in Venezuela\" and an affront to its people. \n\"Venezuela's democracy has been on life support for years now, but the decision to shut down the country's legislative body confirms our worst fears; Maduro is an unhinged dictator who has systematically dismantled democracy in this country,\" Menendez and Rubio said in their statement. \nRubio also met with Venezuelan legislators Wednesday concerning human rights, liberty and free elections in the country, according to tweets by him and one of Luis Florido, president of the Venezuela National Assembly's Commission on Foreign Policy, Sovereignty and Integration. In another tweet, he called Venezuela \"officially a dictatorship.\" #Venezuela now officially a dictatorship after Supreme Court assumes powers of opposition-controlled congress https://t.co/C5nkuyAN90 — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) March 30, 2017 \nVenezuela Assembly President Julio Borges joined opposition leaders in calling for more demonstrations, beginning with a march on Saturday, The Associated Press reported. \n\"Maduro is now the National Assembly,\" Borges told the AP. \nLuis Almagro, Secretary General of the Organization of American States, issued a statement Thursday saying the body of 35 independent states of the Americas \"denounces the self-inflicted coup d´état perpetrated by the Venezuelan regime against the National Assembly.\" \n\"Unfortunately what we had warned has come to pass,\" Almagro said in the statement. \nThe statement said Almargo is calling for a meeting of the Permanent Council of the OAS to consider the situation in Venezuela and respond. Earlier this week, Almargo had proposed to suspend Venezuela from the OAS, but that proposal was not adopted. \nVenezuelans have been unable to get basic necessities and have had to deal with food shortages as Maduro's government has struggled with triple-digit inflation amid falling oil prices. Venezuela, home to vast oil reserves, has been in political turmoil. Opposition leaders who swept the 2015 congressional elections have clashed with Maduro. In return, Maduro has crack down on the opposition, jailing them and usurping their powers. \nJust last month, the U.S., using the Kingpin Act, declared Venezuela's Vice President Tareck El Aissami a narcotics trafficker and imposed sanctions on a wealthy businessman considered to be El Aissami's front man. \nReuters reported that in response to the Venezuela court's actions, Peru was recalling its ambassador to Venezuela in response. The country's foreign affairs ministry also has begun consulting with members of the Organization of American States to discuss preserving Venezuela's democracy. \nThe court's ruling Wednesday stemmed from Venezuela's congress' refusal to authorize a joint venture with private companies by the state-run oil company, the AP reported.
