Liverpool vs Burnley Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \nBut Dyche said: \"I don't think it's about intimidation. I think we just deal with the realities of the challenge in front of us. \n\"You've got to go home and away to all these places and there are some very good sides. We've shown ourselves to be one with our home form. We are obviously an underdog. We would be anyway but also we haven't won away. \n\"But the beauty of football is it brings up strange anomalies. We've got to make that happen, we can't wait for it. Dyche insists Burnley have togetherness that's important to them \n\"They're a very good squad. They've got depth, can change the side, as they should have - they're a top club. They're still vying for Europe of course. They're certainly one of the bigger challengers, certainly on the road, that come along in the Premier League \n\"But belief and team-ship is an important factor. Although we spent some money this year, we're not cherry picking some of the best technical players in Europe like others are. So that team unity and belief is an important factor.\" Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:44:40.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
