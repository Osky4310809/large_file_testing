Pep Guardiola says it's a shame Chelsea's table lead is so comfortable considering how well Man City are currently playing. Leroy Sane and Sergio Aguero continued their scoring ways as Man City sealed a comfortable win against lowly Sunderland. \nSunderland are expecting Manchester City to make a bid for goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in the summer, a source has told ESPNFC. \nCity's long-term keeper situation is still to be resolved with Claudio Bravo, who joined from Barcelona last August in a Â£17 million deal, now Pep Guardiola's second choice at the club. \nWilly Caballero, who is the current No. 1, will be out of the contract at the end of the summer while England international Joe Hart, who is on loan at Torino, is not expected to return to the Etihad. \nA number of scouts from Premier League clubs have watched Pickford closely and the 22-year-old may consider his future if rock-bottom Sunderland are relegated at the end of the season. \nPep Guardiola told a news conference ahead of Wednesday's Premier League clash with Stoke City that he would like to bring more English players to the Etihad when the summer transfer window opens. \nEngland under-21 international Pickford would appear to fit into that philosophy although City have been linked with a host of other keepers including Benfica's Ederson, Real Sociedad's Geronimo Rulli , and Kasper Schmeichel of Leicester City. \nGuardiola says he has impressed with the quality of English players since he moved to the Premier League and that he would like to add more to his squad. \n\"I would like English players because they know the league and that is much better,\" he said. \"I am really impressed with how many good English players your country has. \n\"Tottenham players, the English players are all amazing, City, United, Chelsea players as well like Cahill. Believe me I would like English players, but it is impossible. It is so expensive.\" \nTottenham full-backs Danny Rose, Kyle Walker and Dele Alli have also been linked with possible moves to the Etihad for next season. \nJonathan is ESPN FC's Manchester City correspondent.
