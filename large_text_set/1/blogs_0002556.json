The book will be published on March 14 by Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. \nIn response, some critics have threatened to boycott all Simon & Schuster books. In response to this disgusting validation of hate, we will not cover a single @simonschuster book in 2017. https://t.co/NAJhTgdeyX — Chicago Rev of Books (@bookschicago) December 29, 2016 Sometimes it's a tough call for bookshops between respecting free speech and not promoting hate speech. Sometimes not.
