There are dandelions all over my yard. I have bees. I have birds that you don't see where you live, but they come to us because it's so quiet and there are so many trees. So I just ask you to please find another approach.\" \nNeighbors have launched a grassroots effort against the Highway 380 Bypass plans, including an online petition that as of Tuesday night had garnered more than 800 signatures . \nDuring a Monday work session, council members told city staff they did not support a bypass route on Bloomdale Road â one of the three road alignment options. The city is now exploring additional alignment options, but no route is off the table, said Jennifer Arnold, McKinney planning manager, in an email. \nLast year, the City Council passed a resolution opposing conversion of busy Highway 380 into a limited access roadway or freeway because of a lack of right of way on each side. \n\"The reality is we have to do something,\" McKinney Mayor Brian Loughmiller said. \"We're not there yet. Most likely there's going to be continued studies on multiple routes, multiple concepts.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:29:41.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
