Terrence Romeo dropped 27 points in the win against the Bolts. Photo by Josh Albelda/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The numbers GlobalPort Batang Pier star Terrence Romeo has been putting up 7 games into the 2017 PBA season are staggering. As difficult as it was to imagine Romeo getting even better following last PBA season, that’s been the case in the Philippine Cup, where GlobalPort has won 4 games against 3 losses, mostly on the brilliance of their superstar and face of the franchise. Romeo’s 27 points per game on 43.6% shooting and 39.3% accuracy from downtown are career-highs. He’s also getting to the free throw line 8.1 times a contest and nailing 89.5% of his charities (also career bests) while dishing out 6.1 dimes a game - the most he’s ever averaged since entering the pro league out of FEU. It was only a matter of time before Romeo started to challenge June Mar Fajardo, the PBA’s reigning 3-time MVP, and Jayson Castro for the title of the best local player in the league. That time is now. More than the numbers, the eye test also shows that Romeo has improved. In basketball, often times slower is better. While Romeo has both the speed and ball handling to elude defenders for open jumpers or drives to the rim, he’s been better at navigating the floor and using change of pace hesitation moves to find open teammates, which explains the increased assist numbers. He’s become more patient, and the results are rewarding for the Batang Pier. ( READ: Becoming elite passer next step in Terrence Romeo’s evolution ) “It keeps you on your toes a lot more,” said Chris Newsome about defending Romeo’s added passing ability. Newsome is one of the best one-on-one defenders in the PBA and spent most of his time during the Bolts’ defeat to GlobalPort guarding Stanley Pringle. But during moments he was matched up against Romeo, it was the latter who had the advantage. “You can’t just hard show or you can’t double team him, cause he’s a willing passer, so he’ll make the right play majority of the time.” Two possessions during crunch time of GlobalPort’s win against Meralco stand out to display the overall package of Romeo’s capabilities. With the Batang Pier ahead 89-85 and 1:40 remaining on the game clock, Pringle had the ball at the top of the key. Romeo used a screen set by JR Quinahan on the baseline to get open at the wing. That split second when Romeo was left open from deep had both Anjo Caram and Reynel Hugnatan - Quinahan’s man - rush to contest a potential Romeo jumper, leaving Quinahan open to cut to the rim for an easy floater. Cliff Hodge, one of the most athletic players in the PBA, couldn’t get to Quinahan in time on the rotation for a clean block. He was called for goaltending, extending GlobalPort’s lead to 6 with a minute and a half to go. “ Credit sa mga teammates ko tapos sa coaching staff, kasi mga crucial moments, nag deliver sila ,” said Romeo after the game. (Credit goes to my teammates and coaching staff, because during the crucial moments, they delivered.) Hugnatan then scored on a hook shot on the other end to cut the lead back down to 4. On the next Batang Pier offensive possession, the action started again with Pringle holding the ball at the top of the key. Pringle attacked the lane a little bit before handing the ball to Romeo and then giving him a screen. Romeo didn’t use the screen and pulled the ball back out a little further, giving his defender - Meralco rookie Ed Daquioag - time to get in a defensive stance. Romeo decided to go isolation, using his top-notch ball handling skills to gather momentum. First, he dribbled left, then right, getting Daquioag off-balance. Romeo was able to get a step on his defender to enter the paint. Hodge came over on the rotation to contest, but Romeo was too quick and had a clean-enough look to bank in a floater which essentially sealed the game. “That comes down to playing team defense in order to be able to stop somebody like that,” Newsome said. “You have to have your team defense on point.” “ Ang option i-set ako, pero good reads nang teammates ko - si Stanley at si kuya JR - kasi masyadong collapse saakin yung depensa ,” explained Romeo. (The option is to set me up, but my teammates - Stanley and JR - made good reads, because the defense was collapsing on me.) The current PBA hierarchy is simple: there’s the 6-1 San Miguel Beermen, and then everyone else. GlobalPort still has a shot at the second seed for the playoffs, but consistency is something it will need - especially when it comes to holding leads. But the benefit of having a Romeo on the Batang Pier’s roster means they have a shot against anyone in any game. Romeo can go off for 40 on any evening, and now that he’s become an even more well-rounded player, it makes him and his team just more lethal. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
