I am a small town girl who moved to the big city a decade ago. And, like most people who find their homes outside their comfort zones, I fell in love with Mumbai. So this, for lack of a better word, is my love sage with the city of stars. Okay let's, dive right in. \nOne of the constants that you'll hear from people in Mumbai is that they will never be able to live anywhere else, ever again. And, honestly, that holds true for me as well. As someone who moved to the city a decade ago, I cannot even imagine moving in any other part of the country and not missing Mumbai every minute. Not that Mumbai is a dream city, it really isn't. You've got insane amounts of traffic, you've got horrible roads, water problems, too much pollution, lots of people everywhere, zero space to breathe... still, despite all this, I and most Mumbaikars will never be able to survive anywhere else. \nDespite its not so romantic spirit, Mumbai has a charm that reigns you in. The thing with Mumbai is, you either love it or you hate it. The first time you step into the city, that's what will decide your fate. Look around, and you either see the beautiful skyline with the sea in the backdrop, or you see insane amounts of traffic on your Google map and mayhem on the streets... there is no in-between! \nOn a recent trip to Delhi , I ended up having a \"I love Mumbai a bit too much to give Delhi a fair chance\" conversation (come on, we've all had them) with a colleague, and she actually summed it up best. \"Mumbai is too real.\" That is probably the most honest way to describe the city. It's real, very real. \nFor a place that is known as the \"City of Dreams\", Mumbai can also be quite heartbreaking. Yes, it does let you dream, but it also gives you a big kick if you aren't prepared to work for that dream. You need to make sure you are all in, to make it work, because the city won't let your dreams come true without putting in the work. You need to get your hustle boots on, and work your way up. \nThe city is also very practical. In Mumbai you see life as is. You work hard just like everyone else, you run to catch that train just like everyone else, you deal with all the problems just like everyone else... no privilege, no entitlement is going to help you cut corners. That fair playground that everyone has, that's what makes the city beautiful. You know that if you work hard, you'll make it. \nI've stuck around for 10 years, and even today, when I look at the pretty skyline we have between Worli and Bandra, I smile because I know that I am in Mumbai and despite all its flaws, this is one place that is going to push me to be the best version of myself. And just for that, I will choose to anchor my life's ship at this harbour, for as long as I can..
