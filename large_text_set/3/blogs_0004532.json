So is Lionel Messi’s . \nThe Argentine forward hasn’t always seen eye to eye with his manager although their relationship has strengthened over time. \nIn just 10 months time Messi can be approached by any club to be signed on a free transfer, because his contract expires in June 2018 and thus far he has not put pen to paper on a new deal. \nWhen it comes to Messi’s signing a renewal, perhaps more significant than Luis Enrique leaving is who the club are planning to appoint instead. Messi's deal expires in less than 18 months (Photo: Alex Caparros) Luis Enrique is standing down at the end of the season (Photo: David Ramos) \nThis is one of the reasons that Jorge Sampaoli is such a strong choice for the role. \nThe Sevillla manager would love the chance to work with Messi and Leo can rest assured that if his compatriot takes the reins then he will be given a lot of freedom and a big say in how the team functions around him. How Mundo Deportivo reported the news (Photo: ) \nTalks have taken place between Messi, his father Jorge, and the board, but they will take on a new colour after Lucho’s early statement on his future. \nThe surprise about his decision boils down to the timing. For months it had seemed likely he would walk away from the Camp Nou when his contract expired in June, moreso after the crushing 4-0 defeat by PSG in the Champions League last 16 first leg.

Barca have moved to the top of La Liga (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nWaiting until the end of the season would have bordered on farcical, with the frenzy over his future sure to distract both team and coach from their goals, while not allowing Barcelona sufficient time to react. \nAnnouncing his decision after a fine performance in which many of the major qualities from his reign were on display—not least the chemistry of his razor sharp trio of forwards, Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar—made this seem like a last call to arms, rather than a desertion. \nBecause Barcelona are alive in three competitions and there is a small, but quiet belief at Camp Nou that even at 4-0 down against PSG, the game is not over, the jig is not up. Barca are still hopeful of a Champions League comeback (Photo: AFP) Read More Pep Guardiola \"sad\" about Luis Enrique quitting at Barcelona \nWith hot-shot Suarez, lightning bolt Neymar and the man widely considered the best player of all time—clue: Argentine, wears the No 10 shirt—nothing is impossible. \nAnd like Barcelona’s chief Josep Maria Bartomeu did when he called presidential elections in January 2014, Luis Enrique’s announcement to leave could be the spur the team needs in the coming weeks to kick on as the season hits its home straight. Sport's front cover on Thursday \nHowever the timing of the decision wasn’t for everyone. One of Lucho’s biggest detractors, the always-polemic Diario Sport editor Lluis Mascaro, wrote: “Nonsensical timing, especially considering in his pre-game press conference he knocked back claims he was tired, announcing he was ‘exultant’. Twenty-four hours later, he'd changed his mind. Insulting…” \nWhile few expected him to continue, the timing was also a surprise for the players, with Sport reporting the dressing room was shocked into silence when he told them the news. \n“First he told us he was going to leave, then the media. Now we want to enjoy what’s left of the season and hopefully finish with success,” said Ivan Rakitic.
