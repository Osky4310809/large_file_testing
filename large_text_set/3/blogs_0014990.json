They use smaller pigs, and sometimes their little legs get broken and their shoulders get broken.”\nRobb’s change.org petition had about 2,765 signatures by midday Tuesday. It calls for an end to the event at the Prince Edward Island Plowing Match and Agricultural Fair, which is scheduled to be held in late August in Dundas.\nShe said the event may be steeped in tradition, but it remains cruel.\nRelated After stints in P.E.I. and N.L., skip Adam Casey finds a home with Saskatchewan at the Brier A fresh indignity for Canada’s smallest province: P.E.I. wiped off several maps Forget New Brunswick, P.E.I. politicians seek to end any debate over where Confederation began “If it’s part of history, shouldn’t it stay in the past? Times are changing,” she said. “Society is viewing animal cruelty differently now … If the kids were told what happens to the poor pigs, and they realized that they get hurt, well they wouldn’t want to do it.”\nFair president Gordon Jackson was unavailable for comment Tuesday. However, he told the Charlottetown Guardian that the fair’s board will be talking about the event with the provincial Department of Agriculture, which must ensure animals are treated humanely.\nEarlier this year, Robb led a successful campaign to stop a similar pig scramble at the Westmorland County Agricultural Fair in Petitcodiac, N.B.\nRobb said she works closely with Toronto Pig Save, whose website encourages plant-based vegan living and holds regular vigils to remember the young pigs killed daily at slaughter houses in the city.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:44:34.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
