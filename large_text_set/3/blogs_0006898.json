Toronto police spokesman Mark Pugash did not tell VICE why Cannabis Culture was specifically targeted except to say that it would \"become clear\" in court. \nIn downtown Vancouver, around a dozen local officers raided Cannabis Culture's headquarters Thursday morning, the Vancouver Sun reported. Rex Mekkem, a manager at the Hamilton location that was raided said cops had taken employees' cellphones as evidence, according to Leafly . \n\"They're just taking everybody's names and everybody's phones and kicking us loose, because it has to do with Toronto, they said.\" \nThe Emerys own around 20 Cannabis Culture shops across Canada. The first Toronto store opened just after the city-wide Project Claudia raids. They sell weed to anyone who is legal age, no prescription required. \nLawyer and cannabis advocate Kirk Tousaw has been providing updates on the situation on social media. He said there is a bail hearing for all five arrested tomorrow at Toronto's Old City Hall and that the Crown is seeking \"large dollar value sureties\" in order to have them released. \nTousaw strongly condemned the police's actions. \n\"Good human beings are being literally locked into cages for cannabis. Canada. 2017. Shameful. History will judge us poorly for this immoral and unjust war on peaceful people and a simple, beneficial plant.\" \nBut Pugash said his force will continue to crack down on dispensaries until the laws change. \n\"The only people who appear to be unhappy are the people who are making a lot of money operating an illegal business.\" \nFollow Manisha Krishnan on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:06:29.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
