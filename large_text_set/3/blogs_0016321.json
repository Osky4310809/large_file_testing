India has plans to generate 25 percent of its electricity from nuclear power by 2050, according to the World Nuclear Association . America could get less than 10 percent of its electricity from nuclear by 2050, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:48:42.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
