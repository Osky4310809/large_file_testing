But the 2004 Oscars party dress that Kirsten Dunst recently recycled ? We never want this frock to disappear.\nAttending the launch of Chopard’s Garden of Kalahari collection in Paris over the weekend, Dunst wore a vintage lace Christian Lacroix dress from her personal collection (meaning the designer didn’t loan her the dress for the occasion). As People first reported , Dunst previously wore the ’80s-inspired dress to an Academy Awards after party 13 years ago.\nHere she is Saturday night in Paris. David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Chopard And here she is, in 2004, wearing the same dress with similar layered diamond necklaces and a pair of red satin heels. Jean-Paul Aussenard/WireImage So. Utterly. Gorgeous. \nSwitching up the look only slightly, Dunst at one point on Saturday buttoned a black blazer over her dress, amping up the sexy, Madonna-esque quality of her look (is anyone else getting “Like a Virgin” vibes?).\nJulien M. Hekimian/Getty Images for Chopard Dunst’s longtime stylists, Nina and Clare Hallworth, put Dunst’s Paris look together, noting in an Instagram post that the lace dress belonged to the actress.\n@kirstendunst a night out in #paris dressed to the nines in her own vintage @christianlacroix #hautecouture @chopard @chopardbycaroline /styled by @nina.clare @therexagency makeup @sabrinabmakeup hair @carlosferraz_ #revisited #loved #again #andagain #leggs11 #bts #lotd #cityoflove #christianlacroix #kirstendunst \nA photo posted by @nina.clare on Jan 21, 2017 at 12:45pm PST \nIn a previous interview with People , the Hallworths said of Dunst , “Kirsten is an adventurous old soul. She has confidence and style and can carry off many looks.”\nConfidence and style were on full display Saturday night and Kirsten, you’ve never looked better! (BTW, can we borrow that dress some time? It’s perfect !)\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:01:34.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
