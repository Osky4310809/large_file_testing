FUTA was in the 15th position. \n“Many of our courses are on interim accreditation. A good example is the School of Environmental Technology with six departments where only one department (Building Technology) got full accreditation due to lack of equipment in the laboratories. \n“Prof. Daramola embarked on global tours all in the name of signing MOUs which has not added any value to the university but rather, causing more harm to our foreign exchange as a nation. \n“As at today, there is no single foreign student or expatriate in FUTA again unlike before. \nDurojaiye asked the Economic and Financial Crime Commission, EFCC, to either clear the institution’s Vice Chancellor of alleged corrupt practices or charge him to court. \nHe expressed concern over the slow pace of investigation which started three months ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:22:50.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
