The offer has now gone live, and the telco is giving users 10GB of free 4G data per month for three months – 30GB in total.To claim the free data offer, you need to download the MyAirtel app on Android or iOS, and log in using your number. You’ll see a banner at the top asking you to claim your free data, and clicking on it will credit the data to your account. You’ll receive a confirmation SMS notifying you when the offer has been activated in your account. Airtel’s free data offer for postpaid users comes soon after the brand announced its ‘ Broadband surprises ‘ offer for all users. However, in the case of its broadband users, Airtel was offering free data for life, while for postpaid users, it’s just for a few months. Airtel has chosen an apt time to roll out free data to postpaid users, given that Reliance Jio’s Happy New Year offer is expiring at the end of the month, and will require users to recharge for Rs 303 per month if they want to continue the 1GB per day data benefits under its Prime membership .
