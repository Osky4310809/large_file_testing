Trump tweet \nCalifornia is \"out of control\" in many ways, and voters agree \"otherwise they wouldnt have voted for me,\" he added. Trump lost California, which leans left politically, by a wide margin to former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. \n\"I don't want to defund the state or city, I don't want to defund anybody, I want to give them the money they need to properly operate a city or a state,\" Trump said. \nThat said, \"if they're going to have sanctuary cities we may have to do that - certainly that would be a weapon.\" show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:49:20.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
