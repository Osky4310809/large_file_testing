Photo: Apple \nApple’s surprise announcement of new products and software wasn’t all that surprising if you’ve been keeping up with the latest rumors. \nThe updates were practically announced yesterday when the company said its store would be down in the morning for “maintenance.” Despite all the rumors of new iPads and RED iPhones that have been out for weeks, Apple still managed to sneak in a few surprises that were both good and bad. \nWe’re eagerly awaiting Apple’s rumored April keynote, but here’s the biggest news from today’s teaser: Clips \nApple’s decision to take on Snapchat with its new social sharing app Clips is perhaps the biggest surprise of the day. There was a rumor last year that Apple planned to launch a social app in early 2017 , but considering how badly Apple’s previous efforts in social have gone, we didn’t think they’d actually do it. \nClips launches next month. Instead of being a closed platform, Apple’s app will let users export their videos and photos to be shared on Facebook, Instagram, and iMessage. Fat iPad iPad is more affordable than ever. Photo: Apple \nNot only did Apple drop the price on the iPad Air 2’s successor (now simply called ‘iPad’), but it is thicker and heavier too. That’s sacrilegious to Jony Ive’s entire design philosophy. It could also help Apple move more units though. With a $329 price tag, brighter screen, faster processor and improved cameras, the new iPad could be a big hit in the Education market. White face iPhone \nRumors of a (RED) iPhone surfaced more than a month before its official unveiling today, but we didn’t know it was going to be quite so lame. Sure, the red color casing looks fine, but it would look so much better with a black front instead of an ugly white face. \nThe new RED devices are also the most expensive iPhone models. Apple should’ve made them $50 cheaper than the baseline iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 to get more people to upgrade. Instead prices start at $749. New Bands New colors for a new look this spring. Photo: Apple \nThe rumor mill never caught wind of the new Spring Apple Watch band colors before they were unveiled today. Prices on the new bands range from $49 to $689. There are a variety of options for woven nylon, sport, Nike Sport, and Hermès bands. Apple loves coming out with new bands every couple of months to attract attention for the Apple Watch so the new spring bands shouldn’t weren’t the biggest of surprises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:38:07.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
