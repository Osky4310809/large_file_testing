After the chaotic opening, Jimmy then attempts to bring some calm to the proceedings with a somber parody of the La La Land tune “City of Stars,” only to have his attention stolen firstly by a fresh-breathed Ryan Reynolds, and then a resplendent Justin Timberlake. It’s safe to say that the musical’s star, Ryan Gosling, is nonplussed by the host’s efforts.\nWatch the hilarious footage above, and then check out Donald Glover giving props to Migos’s monster hit “Bad and Boujee” at the ceremony here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T12:50:58.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
