A record number of entries were submitted for this year's competition, which is in its 53rd year. \nBT Ireland has announced that it has extended its partnership with the exhibition until at least 2020. \nOpening the conference, Mr Higgins highlighted the importance of science and of technology transfer in the response to current global challenges such as pollution, poverty and climate change. \nHe also spoke about the crucial role of imagination in scientific endeavour. \nOver the next four days 550 science projects from all over the country will be on display. \nThey were chosen from a record 2,091 individual and group entries, involving 4,591 students and 375 schools will be represented, up 2% on last year. \nGood news emerging from the @BTYSTE this morning is that @BTGroup has committed to sponsoring it for another 3 years. pic.twitter.com/p14jJxvF4I — Will Goodbody (@willgoodbody) January 11, 2017 \nJust under two thirds (61%) of this year's entrants are female, which the organisers consider to be a positive sign that girls interest in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) is increasing. \nThe most popular category for entries was Social and Behavioural Sciences, which accounts for 41% of the projects. \nThe county with the largest number of entries is Cork, followed by Dublin and Limerick. \nThe main exhibition will be open to the public from Thursday until Saturday. The winners will be crowned on Friday evening at an awards ceremony. \nAlso running alongside the main event will be the RDS Primary Science Fair, which is now in its eighth year. \nBeginning on Thursday, hundreds of fourth, fifth and sixth class pupils from all over the country will display their science, technology, engineering and maths projects in a non-competitive forum. \nOther events taking place include The Ultimate Science Show, Discover the Cosmos 3D and another show by mentalist David Meade. \nOn Thursday, the former Manchester United and England footballer Rio Ferdinand and Graeme Hackland, the IT Director at Formula 1 team Williams are taking part in an event to encourage young people from disadvantage backgrounds to pursue a career in STEM. \nWorld of Robots and TITAN the Robot will also be back again this year to entertain the visiting public.
