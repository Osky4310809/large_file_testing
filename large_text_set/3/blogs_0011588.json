They are kept in small cages in laboratories, deprived of fitting mental and physical stimulation, with absolutely no company. \nSeeing as primates are very similar to humans, in their emotional and mental intelligence, it is no surprise that these awful conditions lead many of the animals to develop obsessive behaviors or even resort to self-harm due to their inability to cope with the situation. While the types of experiments carried out on primates may vary, recent investigations into labs have shown gruesome research on the brain where monkeys had chambers implanted into their skulls along with electrodes. The methods used to restrain primates in labs are nothing short of horrific, often they are restrained in full body chambers that prohibits movement of any kind. Given that primates are known to experience pain and fear like humans, we can only imagine the suffering these intelligent beings go through – all in the name of “science.” \nKnowing the horrors of primate experimentation, many airlines have stood up and refused to transport primates from breeding farms to laboratories. According to a petition on Care2 , Vietnam Airlines joined other carriers in their decision to no longer support the practice of flying animals to the locations of laboratories. This was in 2013 – but just three years later, in 2016 , the airline was caught breaking that prohibition by shipping several monkeys to Russia for experiments. \nThis awful step backward and it comes at great cost to the animals who are now being sent to a very cruel and unusual death. \nThe good news is we all have the power to pressure this airline to make a change. Opposition to the practice of transporting lab animals is what lead to the prohibition in the first place, so it is time to put the heat back on! \nClick here to sign the petition to Vietnam Airlines’s CEO to stick to the company’s declaration to never again support the primate shipments for animal testing! \nImage source: Michael Bezushko /Shutterstock Want to read more posts like this?
