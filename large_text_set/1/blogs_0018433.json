But since our theme is ‘When Silence Becomes Betrayal,’ I think us continuing to be silent about the people behind him while knowing their importance is a sign of betrayal, so we decided to open up that dialogue.” \nSet up in Heritage Hall were nine circular tables, each covered in confetti and a list of questions regarding the LGBTQA movement and how it relates to Dr. King’s accomplishments. Friends, family and strangers sat at tables discussing each question at hand. \nAfter a free dinner and some time to contemplate responses, discussion opened up to the entire room. The question, ‘is it possible to support Black Lives Matter without supporting LGBTQA rights’ began the honest conversation and prompted a young boy sitting at table seven with his family to raise his hand and give an answer that would cue the rest of the room to clap and cheer enthusiastically. \n“I say no because you can’t support Black Lives Matter without supporting all black people,” he said. \nAfter a handful more of questions and courageous responses that provoked snaps from other members of the audience, five performances took the stage. Each performance began by introducing a forgotten woman or LGBTQA persons who helped Dr. King in his efforts. \nThe first performance of the night did not hold back by doing contemporary dance to a slam poem about the ‘Hands Up, Don’t Shoot’ protest. Each participant was dressed in white face paint and bright red lips. The performance evoked strong and powerful emotions about the fight against police brutality. At the end, each dancer held up a poster with the name of a black casualty to police violence. \nDavid Gaines, the last performer of the night, performed a powerful slam poem he wrote that ended up winning second place. He said this poem in particular was for the people who are often silenced for talking about the issues that pertain to them. \n“Especially in a PWI, predominantly white institution, when a black person has a lot of white friends, because those problems don’t directly apply to them they feel as though they don’t have to discuss them,” Gaines (senior - English) said. “I find most times it’s almost annoying to them, so I wrote that poem out of frustration of me talking to a lot of people and me feeling as though my issues weren’t important to them.” \nRebecca Machtinger said she came to the event because this is something she’s interested in. \n“Coming to these events gets me more inspired to get out there and be an activist and be a member of the community,” Machtinger (senior - human development and family studies) said. “And since I am white, this isn’t really my domain, so I just want to learn more, really.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T10:51:41.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
