Other news publications confirmed that the meeting was taking place, however, so it was hardly a secret. \nFezzan, which is twice the size of Italy, is inhabited by only 400,000 people. The huge desert region is regularly crossed by caravans of smugglers who deliver migrants from Niger’s border to the coastal regions, where they are placed on boats heading for Europe. \nFor their help in stopping human trafficking, the Italian authorities reportedly offered the Libyan delegation economic aid, investment, and equipment, such as drones and access to satellite technology for surveillance purposes. \nThe deal between the mayors and the Italian government also envisages investment in Libyan healthcare, transport, education, renewable energy, and research. In addition, it includes funding to help the Libyan coastguard intercept migrant vessels and for training frontier guards.

The next meeting is scheduled for March. \nUnder the February 2 deal, local authorities in Libya’s southern regions are expected to establish patrols and close off the southern border that serves as the “main gate” for sub-Saharan migrants trying to reach Europe. Italy will reportedly provide money, training, and equipment to the UN-supported Libyan government in Tripoli so that it can strengthen its coast guard and control over its borders. \nLibya has fallen into chaos since 2011, when its former leader, Muammar Gaddafi, was toppled and murdered during a civil war, in which NATO and its allies supported the rebels. Once a prosperous country that served as a migration buffer zone between Africa and Europe due to Gaddafi’s policies, Libya has turned into a major human trafficking hub since his demise, as clan-based militias have capitalized on opportunities to profit from people smuggling. \nEurope has seen an unprecedented flood of migrants arriving since 2014. One of the favored entry routes takes asylum seekers across the central Mediterranean. They often land in Italy, the second largest recipient of arrivals, after Greece, according to Europol. More than 180,000 migrants were illegally smuggled from Africa into Italy on board unseaworthy and overcrowded vessels in 2016, according to the UN refugee agency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:19:13.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
