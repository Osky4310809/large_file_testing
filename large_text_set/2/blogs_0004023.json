So far, 3,000 e-trikes have been rolled out aimed to jumpstart the shift to e-vehicles to reduce the country’s fuel imports and lessen annual carbon dioxide emissions.   \nApart from including e-vehicle charging areas, the DOE also wants to update standards for gas stations to include other amenities such as the parking area, comfort rooms, CCTVs and even convenience stores, among others. \n“Apart from readying electric vehicle infrastructures, we also want to strengthen our gasoline stations’ consumer welfare and satisfaction through well-maintained and functional amenities within its premises,” Cusi said. \nUnder the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act 8479 or the Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1998, the DOE is empowered to subject all industry participants to provide suitability of facilities for their proposed operation in accordance with existing national and accepted international standards. \nBased on existing policies, this provision in the Oil Deregulation Law was reflected in the DOE’s Retail Rules on Liquid Petroleum Products (Department Circular DC2003-11-010), wherein the Philippine National Standards on Petroleum Products, Retail Outlets and Health, Safety and Environment specifies that the building/structures (i.e., gasoline stations) shall have a sales office, toilet facilities and an electrical/mechanical room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:49:34.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
