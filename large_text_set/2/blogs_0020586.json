They weren't worth exploring. The ones we were looking for had little blips Their brightness stayed constant except for small dips \nEach dip is a planet that, just as it passes In front of the star, blocks some light from our glasses The brightness we measure goes blip every time The planet goes once around. Then it re-aligns.(Another way that you can think of the dips:Each blip is like a single tiny eclipse) \nArmed with the star's brightness, we measured and figured How big are the planets and how they're configured. This new star with planets is called TRAPPIST-1 It's not a star that is at all like the Sun It's much much much smaller, and also less hot Two thousand times fainter. (Now that is a lot).An \"ultracool dwarf\" star they call it. And hey, It’s just about 40-odd light years away. NASA/JPL-Caltech The planets have letters for names. Now, you see, From outside to in it’s h, g, f, e, d, And, yes, as you guessed, after that, c and b (The first one's called b. There is no planet a. The \"a\" is reserved for the star, by the way). \nAll seven planets are close to their star. They orbit real fast since they're not very far Planet b's year: one and a half Earth days. If you lived there you'd have all sorts of birthdays! Stand on a planet in the TRAPPIST-1 system Oh, the planets you'd see in the sky – you can't miss 'em! Their orbits are so close that they'd each appear As big as the full Moon! Bigger when they're near. (Imagine the werewolf problem they must fear!) The Sun in the sky would stay in the same place. The planets always show the star the same face The planets would shift and sometimes look like crescents A peek at that sky's like an antidepressant! IoA/Amanda Smith The two inner planets, planets b and c. Are too hot for oceans. Water would be steam. But the next four planets: d, e, f, and g Are all at about the right place for a sea. They could have liquid water, although We don't know if they even have H2 or O. \nThere's plenty of planets out there that are dry Just look at that big red dot up in Earth's sky.That's Mars, it's got water but only a trace And Venus, of course, is a hot hot dry place IoA/Amanda Smith The planets' orbits were not set by chance They seem to be following a cool cosmic dance Take for example planets d and e When e completes two orbits, d has done three. They meet up again at the very same place This orbital resonance is common in space. Each pair of planets is in resonance. So, It's like the whole system is doing a tango! We think that a resonant configuration Is a signpost of the planets' migration That means that the planets' orbits shifted While they were forming, inward they drifted. One cool last thing I really should say-o TRAPPIST-1’s connected to Galileo! He found four big moons orbiting Jupiter's skies And the TRAPPIST-1 star is about Jupiter's size The TRAPPIST-1s planets are much farther out But take about the same time to go around. Now let's wrap up with a ditty for later It's written for you if you're a planet hater \"Planets\", you say, \"no big deal. There's a zillion. Eight in our Solar System and a billion In orbit around other stars in the sky Why should I care about this one little guy?\" Getty Images I'd answer your question with a look back at history Discovering new planets may help solve a big mystery. Are we all alone? Is there other smart life? (Do I have an alien doppelganger and wife?) It's not at all simple. But here's a suggestion Any life out there will need its own planet Maybe with oceans or ice caps or granite. NASA We now have the telescopes, tools and techniques To find other planets and take a sneak peak To try to find out if the Earth is unique.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:31:17.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
