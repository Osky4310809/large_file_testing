Beall, who also wrote an early (and ultimately scrapped) version of \"Justice League,\" recently spoke with Collider about DC's next big screen outings, and said a significant change was in store for fans. \nHere's what he told Collider: \n\" ... [W]hat you're going to see — I hope I'm not going to get in trouble for saying this — but it's much more fun, much poppier, than ... I haven't seen 'Wonder Woman' yet, but 'Batman vs Superman' was a little more somber. But 'Justice League' is a lot more fun. And I think that feels to me like the direction those movies are heading now.\" \nThat's certainly a diplomatic way of putting things, and should excite DC fans who were disappointed by the unrelenting darkness of \"Dawn of Justice.\" \n\"Justice League\" is due in theaters on November 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T05:46:45.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
