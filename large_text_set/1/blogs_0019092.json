The 58-year-old actress visited the late night show to talk about the highly anticipated NBC reboot of her beloved comedy sitcom. She noted that in its nine seasons on the air, Will & Grace , had a handful of A-list guest stars, including Madonna, Cher, Matt Damon, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, Elton John, and more. WATCH: 'Will & Grace' Revival Series Officially Coming to NBC One big surprise came when Madonna appeared on the show in 2003. “We had a lot of other famous, movie star type of people but the pop stars were really interesting,” Mullally dished. “Everybody was really cool though. A lot cooler than you would think, like Madonna was very cool.” Photo: NBC The comedian added that Madonna was “really nice and really present,” saying the chart-topper was not a prima donna, despite her name's implications. “She didn't necessarily know our real names in real life because why should she, who cares?” Mullally quipped. “Some of the cast were really offended, like, 'She doesn't even know my name!' and I was like, 'Who cares? Madonna's doing our show! It doesn't matter.'” “So she'd be like, 'Hi, Will, hi, Grace?'” Kimmel asked. “Yeah, kinda, yeah, yeah, yeah, but in a nice way,”Mullally admitted. “She doesn't need to know our names for crying out loud. She's doing our show. Who cares?” One diva who lived up to her name was Cher, who appeared on the show in 2000 in an episode titled, “Gypsies, Tramps and Weed.” “I always thought, 'Oh Cher seems so cool, if I ever met her, I know we'd be best friends,'” Mullally said. “Well, not really because, I met her really briefly but that was it because they dropped her in like one of those, like a crane came in and dropped her into the set and then they airlifted her back out at the end of the scene, and we didn't get to talk to her at all.” Apparently the Moonstruck star had a “huge trailer” that she never even used. “All the writers on our show went in and got in the bed and took a picture in Cher's bed, even though she was never in it,” Mullally revealed. WATCH: EXCLUSIVE: Molly Shannon Is So Excited About 'Will & Grace' Revival: 'It's the Best News Ever!' Cher did connect with one member of the cast – Sean Hayes. “She invited Sean to go to her castle in Italy for Thanksgiving, and Sean was like, ‘No,’\" Mullally revealed. \"Sean is so funny, one time he went to Ireland for two weeks with his mother, and Ireland is so beautiful, and he got back, we were like, 'How was it?' and he was like, 'Ugh I was so bored.'” As for the revival of the beloved show, Mullally had fewer details. “We didn't even really know officially until a day before yesterday that it was really officially real, for real, coming back,” she admitted. The 10-episode revival series will feature original stars Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes and will air in the 2017-2018 season.
