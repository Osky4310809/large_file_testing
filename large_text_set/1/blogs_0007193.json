Leongson - Reporter / @RLeongsonINQ INQUIRER.net / 06:45 PM January 10, 2017 \nThrough hardships and triumphs, San Miguel has been toughened by the challenges thrown their way over the past two seasons. \nThat’s why it’s no surprise that the Beermen had enough poise to gut out the 72-70 win over Ginebra on Sunday, prompting team captain Arwind Santos to unearth the old San Miguel mantra of “Iba na ang may pinagsamahan (We go a long way).” ADVERTISEMENT \n“I’m so proud of the brotherhood we have in this team, because I think this is really the best team. Our relationship with each other is different. We’re really solid and you won’t look for anything else.” \nThere’s no denying Santos’ statement with the way the Beermen have been rolling this 2017 PBA Philippine Cup, distancing themselves from the pack as they occupy the pole position at 7-1. \nThe 2013 PBA Most Valuable player said that the team’s chemistry has been the key in the team’s great run so far, now at six straight wins, with stars willing to take the back seat and reserves doing the extra mile all for the benefit of the squad. \n“Every one here is willing to sacrifice the ball rather than shoot it. Nobody will mind if you hog the ball because here, we’re automatic. You can feel it, every one here can score and can be relied on. That’s our bread and butter. We’re number one because of our chemistry. And if your team has a great chemistry, the team will play great.” \nIt also shouldn’t come as a shock that San Miguel is in the top half of the league in points (95.6 points per game), rebounds (53.4 boards) and assists (20.5 assists per game) per outing. \nDespite injuries and off-nights, the Beermen have found a way to fill in for one another with every player knowing their roles all for one common goal. \n“That’s what’s scary about our team. Teams don’t know who will perform for San Miguel. Every one here knows their part, what they have to do, what they have to adjust on, and we’re getting it quickly.” \nSan Miguel returns to action on Friday against Rain or Shine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T18:19:02.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
