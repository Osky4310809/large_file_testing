The group now intends to focus on a five-year building programme to better balance funding and investment. \nSwitching to coal power \nIt was further learned that the company has switched to using coal at its cement plants across the country in response to disruption to gas supplies and to lower input costs. \nThe company reported that its fuels costs rose by 32.3 percent to $14.4/t in 2016. The cement producer intends to use 12,000t/day of coal. \nAll our cement plants have been converted to coal,” said owner, Aliko Dangote. \nIntermittent periods \nSimilarly, Alhaji Abdulsamad Rabiu, the chairman of BUA Group, said its subsidiary, the Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN) was forced to shut down its Sokoto cement plant for intermittent periods in late 2015 due to poor supplies of low pour fuel oil (LFPO) from the Kaduna refinery. \nHe noted that imported inputs such as fuel, machinery, spare parts and gypsum would all affect the price of cemment. \nAlso, Production managers at Lafarge Africa’s cement plants at Ewekoro and Sagamu, Ogun State have complained about poor supplies of gas. \nSegun Shoyoye and Hannes Diedericks said that the situation started in early 2016 and has led to low production at the plants. \n“The major issue is lack of gas supply because of the blowing up of oil and gas pipelines by militants in the Niger Delta region. We are now using a mixture of gas and black oil for our operations, which is highly costly, and also drops our production from 100 per cent to 75 percent at the Ewekoro plant. This has been going on since February 2016,” said Shoyoye. \nHe added that production at Sagamu stopped for six weeks in May 2016. Production has dropped from 3000t/day to 1000t/day due to the issue. \nLafarge Africa is currently sourcing alternative sources of energy for its cement plants. \nVanguard further learned that Lafarge Africa has signed a $35million contract with Chinese company Rughn Power to build a 16MW captive power plant at its Ashaka cement plant in Gombe State. \nThe lignite burning plant should provide a reliable energy source for the plant to increase its cement production capacity to 1Mt/yr. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:21:35.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
