Back then, BSP chief Mayawati had described the act of merging and then it being called off as a ‘drama’ that would not cover Akhilesh government’s weakness in controlling crime. Former chief minister Mayawati takes immense pride in the fact that voters remember her for her iron grip over law and order in the state. But the halo surrounding her is about to vanish.\nAfter being denied a ticket by Akhilesh, Ansari has been given the BSP ticket from Mau Sadar seat in the upcoming election. The new found camaraderie is such that Mayawati is willing to welcome his entire family. Ansari’s brother Sibgatulla has been given a ticket from Mohammadabad in Ghazipur district while his son Abbas will contest as BSP candidate from and Ghosi in Mau district. Ansari is currently in Lucknow jail for his alleged involvement in BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai’s murder.\nMukhtar Ansari who has joined BSP again, gets ticket from Mau Sadar. Son Abbas gets ticket from Ghosi pic.twitter.com/NWwue5qh64\n— ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) January 26, 2017\nDuring a press conference in June, Mayawati had castigated Akhilesh to such an extent that she claimed if action is taken against criminals, it would ‘fill all jails in the state and SP will be left with none’. In a span of few months, BSP chief is now willing to withdraw the three candidates who have already been given party tickets from these seats where the Ansari family will contest. BSP is betting big on the Dalit-Muslim combine to deliver for them in this election and the assumption is Ansari’s entry would help them consolidate Muslims in their favour in a few districts of eastern UP.\n@yadavakhilesh has his way, SP revokes merger with Mukhtar Ansari's party https://t.co/QytATtIs0c https://t.co/aViFMuWdDM\n— Times of India (@timesofindia) June 26, 2016\nAnsari had formed the QED in 2010 and won two seats in the 2012 assembly election. Shivpal was in favour of giving tickets to Ansari and his family members as this would strengthen their core Muslim vote in the region. But Akhilesh gave a clear indication that he will not give tickets to persons with a criminal background when he went ahead and announced his own candidate from Mau Sadar. Now Mayawati seems to have thrown away all pretensions of having any concern for candidates with a criminal record if it comes at the cost of winning a single assembly seat.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/747108646211858432", "https://twitter.com/ANINewsUP/status/824585384625467393", "https://twitter.com/yadavakhilesh", "https://t.co/NWwue5qh64", "https://t.co/QytATtIs0c", "https://t.co/aViFMuWdDM"], "published": "2017-01-26T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T15:02:58.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
