File photo MANILA, Philippines ( Philippine News Agency ) -- The United States Embassy in Manila is not implementing stricter measures in issuing visas for Filipinos who wish to enter the US. Molly Koschina, US Embassy press attaché, said Filipinos are not among those included in an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump. \"The US Embassy in the Philippines has not changed visa processing or visa requirements. Filipinos are still very much welcome to the United States,\" Koscina said in a chance interview. She said that under the Executive Order on Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals, signed by US President Trump on January 27, only visa issuances to nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen have been suspended. “This executive order does not restrict the travel of dual nationals, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa,” she pointed out.
