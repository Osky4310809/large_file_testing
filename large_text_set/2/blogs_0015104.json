Pep Guardiola is eyeing a reunion with the Argentine ace (Photo: Getty) \nAfter handing new deals to Neymar and Luis Suarez, Barca will struggle to hand Messi an increase on his current wages and stay within the boundaries of La Liga’s salary restrictions. \nClubs cannot spend more than 70 percent of their income on wages – and Messi already earns £20million-a-year after tax. \nBarcelona’s 4-0 Champions League humbling at the hands of Paris St Germain last Tuesday has also raised optimism in Manchester that Messi will seek a new challenge. \nNou Camp chiefs are aware that they are approaching the end of an era and that a major team restructure is required.

They are certain that Guardiola will honour the remaining two-and-a-half years of his contract – and now expect him to stay beyond 2019. \nThe message to Messi is that if he wants to play for Pep again then he will have to move to Manchester.
