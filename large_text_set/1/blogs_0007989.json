He injured his right foot late in the fourth quarter. By Ray Fittipaldo / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nSteelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger had his right foot in a walking boot at his postgame news conference today following the Steelers’ 30-12 victory against the Miami Dolphins in an AFC wild-card game at Heinz Field. Roethlisberger said the injury occurred late in the fourth quarter when he was intercepted by Xavien Howard. Dolphins defensive end Cameron Wake dragged Roethlisberger down from behind as he released the ball. \n“Don’t know anything yet but we’ll find out soon hopefully,” Roethlisberger said. \nRoethlisberger promised to play Sunday when the Steelers travel to Kansas City for an AFC divisional round playoff game against the Chiefs. The game is at 1 p.m. Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium. \n“You’re always worried about being hurt, but I’ll be out there next week,” Roethlisberger said. \nRoethlisberger said he was not surprised head coach Mike Tomlin left him in the game in the fourth quarter when the Steelers led by 24 and 18 points. \n“I don’t know if they had a conversation about staying in or out, but I love being out there with the guys,” he said. \nTomlin did not mention Roethlisberger when he ran down the injuries at his postgame news conference. He said there were “bumps and bruises, nothing of extreme significance.” \nTomlin’s news conference occurred about 20-30 minutes before Roethlisberger’s, so it’s possible he was unaware of the injury when he took the podium. \nRay Fittipaldo: rfittipaldo@post-gazette.com and Twitter @rayfitt1.
