He’s able to cope with most centre-forwards p hysically, and in Portugal, he’s rarely looked flustered in his duties. Additionally, he’s composed on the ball, able to pick short passes into midfield and arrow long balls to a striker or out to the flanks. Gualter Fatia/Getty Images Lindelof has been strongly linked with a move to United. \nThose ball-playing traits and his watchful style of defending seem to make Lindelof a perfect partner for Bailly in practice. The United man was a colossus at the back for Jose Mourinho’s side early in the season, adapting quickly to the robust nature of the Premier League and dominating opposition strikers with his front-foot approach. \nPer sports journalist Liam Canning, if Lindelof was to arrive, he’d become part of a burgeoning young spine of players at Old Trafford: Luke Shaw, Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelöf (providing he joins #mufc ) all under 23. José Mourinho is assembling a very promising defence. — Liam Canning (@LiamPaulCanning) December 21, 2016 \nThere’s no guarantee he’d walk into the team, though, with Bailly himself finding it difficult to get minutes in the starting XI since his return from injury due to the impressive form of Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Rojo and Jones have been so important to United's positive recent form. \nIndeed, when Mourinho was appointed United boss ahead of the campaign, few would have envisioned the pair being his best centre-back partnership. But Jones’ committed defensive style has flourished alongside the composed Rojo, who, being left-sided, has added some desirable balance to the defence. \nAs noted by Squawka Football, the pair have been the bedrock behind the encouraging recent run United find themselves on: Man Utd's Premier League form when Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones have played together this season:WDDD — Squawka Football (@Squawka) January 2, 2017 \nEven so, there will be doubts lingering in the back of the mind of United fans as to how long Jones and Rojo can preserve this dynamic. Not only have both players been inconsistent in the past, but they’ve each suffered with injury issues throughout their career. \nIt’s why Mourinho may turn to someone like Lindelof and do so in January. Although United may struggle to challenge for the title, they remain in contention for the EFL Cup, FA Cup and the UEFA Europa League. Subsequently, there’ll be ample opportunity to put a partnership with Bailly in motion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T11:09:57.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
