Enter Philabundance. On Thursday, the nonprofit launches a program giving each of Gideon’s 330 students a backpack containing three to five pounds of food, such as cereal, canned tuna and raisins, says Philabundance deputy director of community food programs Kendra Gudgeon. \n“Every month, we’ll send enough bags for every student to be able to take home those kid-friendly items and some household staples to be able to have a few extra meals,” Gudgeon explained. \nAnd some produce, too. \n“Gideon will be getting in its first delivery, apples,” she said. “So, apples are a really easy, hard durable produce item that kids can eat and handle easily.” \nGudgeon says the pilot program will be in eight area schools this month, with an eye toward making the monthly giveaways more frequent.
