Bayern Munich’s goalkeeper Manuel Neuer (R) stops a penalty kick from Real Madrid’s Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo (L) during the UEFA Champions League second leg semi-final football match Real Madrid against Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid on April 25, 2012. Bayern Munich reached the Champions League final beating nine-time champions Real Madrid 3-1 on penalties after the two-legged match finished 3-3 on aggregate. Bastian Schweinsteiger slotted home the winning penalty in a thrilling shootout which saw Bayern lead 2-0 at one point after Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka missed theirs for Real.
