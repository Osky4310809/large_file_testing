Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA loving couple described as 'soulmates' died within hours of each other after being married for nearly seven decades in what's being dubbed the 'real life Notebook'. \nThe doting husband had kept his wife 'safe' as she deteriorated from Alzheimer's disease , visiting her every day and hoping they died at the same time so they didn't have to be apart. \nElmer, 93, and Ruth Bihl, 89, met during World War Two when their eyes locked across a dance floor and they swiftly fell in love. \nThe couple married in September 1948 and had five children together. He worked as the manager of a farm and she looked after the kids at their home in Florida. \n\"When she stood at the stove, sometimes with a smudge of flour on her face, he’d give her a hug and a kiss as he headed back to work on the farm after lunch,\" their children in an interview with the Orlando Sentinel. Ruth and Elmer were married for nearly 70 years (Photo: Bihl Family) \n\"Whenever he looked at her, it was obvious that he adored her.\" \nThe pair were inseparable and spent all of their time together after Elmer retired. \nThen tragedy struck when Ruth was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. \nElmer learned to do the chores Ruth would never let him touch when the couple were younger - cooking, cleaning and ironing. \nWhen she was moved to a nursing home after her condition deteriorated, her loving husband turned up to visit at 12pm every day so he could sit with her while she at her lunch. (Photo: Bihl Family) \n\"He wanted to make sure that she was taken care of and safe,\" granddaughter Christine Dudgeon said, \"he doted on her every second of every day until he couldn’t do so anymore.” \nElmer was diagnosed with cancer and, last year, was admitted to the same home where the couple shared a room together. \nElmer died on March 1 at 6.10am. Ruth passed away exactly 23 hours later on March 2 at 5.10am. Their story has been compared with the film The Notebook (Photo: Rex Features) \n“As my dad said, he had to go first because he had to hold the door for her,” granddaughter Christine Dudgeon told the Orlando Sentinel. \nTheir story has drawn comparisons with the film The Notebook, in which a couple who met in the 1940s grow old together. \nAfter the female character, Allie, is diagnosed with dementia, her husband Noah visits the care home every day and they die together on her bed. \nThe couple's funeral took place on Monday and their ashes will be laid to rest together.
