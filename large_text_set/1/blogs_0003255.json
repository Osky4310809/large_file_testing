We don’t want to move.” (Julia Rendleman/For The Washington Post) POWHATAN, Va. — Each day, the sisters of a black order of nuns pass the cemetery lined with white crosses, where enslaved people who worked this plantation are buried.\n“This is sacred land,” said Sister Maureen T. Carroll as she looked over its rolling hills 40 miles west of Richmond and worried about the future.\nIt was her religious order — the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament — that transformed a plantation that once profited from slavery into Catholic boarding schools for African American children. St. Emma Military Academy for boys and St. Francis de Sales School for girls are credited with educating 15,000 black students. But the schools were closed in the early 1970s, and now the cash-strapped order, headquartered in Philadelphia, wants to sell the 2,265 acres known as Belmead Plantation, or Belmead-on-the-James.\nThe remaining five nuns living here say they fear that the land, which has an assessed value of more than $8 million, will wind up in the hands of developers. They are waging a desperate fight to save it.\nAt night, Sister Beulah Martin said, she asks God to help them.\n“I cry,” she said, standing near the James River that flows through the former tobacco plantation. “No one can hear me, but I cry and I pray.”\nThe five nuns — four of whom are white — range in age from 50 to 75. Three of the sisters live in a historical but dilapidated neo-Gothic mansion that sits atop a winding hill. Two others live in an old teachers’ cottage.\nCarroll, 74, said the Virginia nuns understand the need for their superiors in Philadelphia to sell the land, but they are hoping that the order will give them time to raise the money to buy Belmead and run it as an environmental preserve.\nThe sale of the property is being managed by Plante Moran Real Estate Investment Advisors, which asked for proposals by Dec. 19 and will present them to the order’s leadership in January.\nSister Beulah Martin vacuums the nuns’ living quarters.

(Julia Rendleman/For The Washington Post) The decision to put the land and historical buildings on the market mirrors the paths of other religious communities across the country that are selling churches, convents, schools and parishes as their populations decrease.\n“You had to build these big places for sisters to live when you had hundreds and hundreds of sisters,” explained Sister Sandra Schmidt, who serves as a councilor on the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament’s leadership team. “Now you don’t have hundreds and hundreds of sisters, but you have these big places.”\nThe order is also selling its motherhouse in Bensalem, Pa., the site of the National Shrine of Katharine Drexel, who was canonized by the Catholic Church in 2000.\nThere are 150 Blessed Sacrament nuns scattered across the country and abroad, including 50 in Philadelphia and others in New Orleans, Arizona, Haiti and Jamaica. At the order’s peak, there were 600.\n“The median age is 79,” Schmidt said. “Looking at the pool of sisters, there is no one to follow us in leadership roles.”\n[ A young nun in a disappearing world ]\nProceeds from the sale of the Virginia property and the motherhouse will be used to help take care of the elderly sisters as well as support their missions, she said.\n“The big majority are very supportive of the decisions we are making,” Schmidt said. “There is a sadness for all of us. We have taken nothing lightly.”\nThe Virginia property has a rich history. Belmead was built in 1835 by Philip St. George Cocke, who commissioned architect A.J. Davis to build the manor house. About 150 slaves worked the land, growing tobacco and grains.\nIn 1861, Cocke, a U.S. Military Academy graduate, fatally shot himself at Belmead after commanding Confederate troops in the First Battle of Bull Run.\nYears after the war ended, the plantation was put up for sale. In 1891, Katharine Drexel, an heiress who took her religious vows that year, founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People.\nIn 1895, Katharine Drexel, her sister Louise Drexel Morrell and brother-in-law Edward Morrell established two Catholic boarding schools on the property. Thousands of black students came from across the country to attend the schools.\n“This land and property embody extraordinary American history, African American history,” said Patricia C. Gunn, a graduate of St. Francis de Sales High School and an associate professor of law at Ohio University. “It’s extremely important that we save it.”\n[ One man’s quest to preserve the haunting black history of Pocahantas Island ]\nIn 2011, Belmead was placed on the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places . The manor house, the two teachers’ cottages, a stone granary and the St. Francis de Sales school are the only structures still standing on the property.\nDuring a tour, Carroll stopped at the red brick building that once housed the girls’ school. Vines were growing through the stained glass windows of the old chapel.\nSince the announcement of the sale, the community and alumni have formed a nonprofit group, Belmead on the James, to mount a fundraising campaign.\n“What we need to do is show we have the ability to make a multimillion-dollar offer to the sisters in Philadelphia,” said Demetrius Venable, a professor of physics at Howard University and president of Belmead on the James.\nSo far, they have raised $86,000. They are working with graduates of the schools and descendants of Belmead’s slaves and urging their supporters to sign their change.org petition . They have written to philanthropists — including Oprah Winfrey — requesting help. Sister Donna Gould closes that missive with a plea:\n“We cannot lose this place of peace, justice and healing especially in this political climate. Oprah, I ask you to come and see, touch, taste, breathe and listen to the story being told by this land.”\nThey have not heard from Oprah. “Not yet,” Gould said. But she and the other nuns haven’t given up. They still believe their prayers will be answered.\n“It’s always a challenge to keep believing, but we still do,” Carroll said. “That is the work of the spirit.”\nRead more:\nMarcus Garvey’s son wants President Obama to pardon his famous father.
