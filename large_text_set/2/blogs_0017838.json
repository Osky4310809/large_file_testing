Between her rocker dad, Lenny, and her bohemian actress and musician mom, Lisa Bonet, Zoë's inner and outer beauty can't be denied. In a recent interview, Zoë opened up about why she idolizes her mother particularly : \"She kind of stumbled into [the acting] world. It wasn't a conscious choice (a) to be an actress, (b) to be a famous actress, and (c) to be — she shook things up — a model for so many young women. The beautiful thing about her is that she just thought a certain way and lived her life that way.\" \nWe've rounded up Lisa and Zoë's cutest snaps — the ones that always make us do a double take to figure out whether they're actually mother and daughter or some sort of sorceress sisters.
