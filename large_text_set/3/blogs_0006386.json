But it was right. \nThe Frenchman was sent off for the denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity in the 53rd minute of Arsenal's second leg tie with Bayern Munich with the Gunners leading 1-0. \nGreek referee Tasos Sidiropoulos - who was taking charge of his first-ever Champions League knockout game - originally handed a yellow card to Koscielny.

It certainly was. \nOver the two legs, with Koscielny on the pitch, Arsenal would have been leading 2-1.
