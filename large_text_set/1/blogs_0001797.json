After eight long years, the Obama administration is coming to an end. Can you believe it? For years, we’ve been blown away by the grace and dignity the Obamas have carried, despite the racism they’ve faced and the difficulties in bridging the partisan gap. Though his time in office is coming to a close, we can’t help but be proud of everything the Obamas have accomplished .\nFollowing First Lady Michelle Obama’s final speech honoring the School Counselor of the Year, the Obamas threw one last party to celebrate the end of President Obama’s tenure.\nFrom Stephen Spielberg to Meryl Streep, and Nick Jonas to Magic Johnson, pretty much every celebrity you could think of was in attendance.\nThough no cell phones were allowed into the event, CNN’s Betsy Klein tweeted the arrivals so it was almost like being there. Almost . Favorite couples alert- @tomhanks and @RitaWilson , followed shortly by @johnlegend and @chrissyteigen at the White House pic.twitter.com/Pv3GPYVZu7 \n— Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) January 7, 2017 In addition to Betsy Klein’s tweets, several celebs posted pictures of themselves with their dates for the night, whether it be friends, or in Jordin Sparks’ case, family.\nGetting to take my Dad to the White House...Priceless. Soooo excited! Cheers! *drops mic* \nA photo posted by Jordin Sparks (@jordinsparks) on Jan 6, 2017 at 5:50pm PST \nThough we weren’t in attendance — the event was held for donors and supporters over the years — the joy from social media posts shared from celebs in attendance was infectious, and reminded us that there is so much to celebrate about the Obamas.\nBout to fly 21 hours to DC to bid farewell to the greatest president in US history. God bless you @Potus \n— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) January 5, 2017 And if we’re not emotional yet, we definitely will be when we see Obama’s farewell speech in a few days.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T03:14:44.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
