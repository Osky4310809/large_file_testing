Enter the eSight 3 , a breakthrough in electronic glasses that uses tiny, high-speed, high-definition cameras to project a video feed that allows visually impaired users to see their surroundings. “It was the most beautiful thing,” said Yvonne Felix, referring to the moment she saw her 2-month-old son for the first time in an interview with CNET . “Like it’s burned in my mind for the rest of my life.” (See the eSight 3 in action via CNET below.) \nThink of the eSight 3 as a combination of Google Glass and a VR headset: Tiny cameras project real-time images onto two OLED screens, and the entire system tilts with the user to avoid eliminating peripheral vision, which helps keep the user from getting nauseous or losing balance. And a controller attached to the headset lets users manipulate an image by zooming in and out and controlling contrast. RoboCop has nothing on this trick piece of tech.
