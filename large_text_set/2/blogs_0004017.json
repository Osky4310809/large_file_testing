Manitoba’s Welcome Place, the province’s largest refugee settlement agency, helped 91 individuals seeking asylum between Nov. 1 and Jan. 25. This three month total represented more asylum seekers than the agency previously processes in a typical year. Many of those the agency assisted braved the freezing prairie winter to walk into Canada, according to Reuters reporting .

Some are entering Canada legally, others illegally, at points all along the U.S.-Canadian border. The Canada Border Services Agency reported 7,000 refugee applicants entered Canada in 2016 through land ports of entry from the United States, a 63 percent increase from the prior year.
