However, I think the most important thing is that he is sober and his life is in order. As fans, we sometime forget that football is secondary to life, which goes well beyond any career. We should be pulling for him as a person, not a player. silvernblacksabbath says: Feb 10, 2017 9:37 AM \n“The QB must go down and he must go down hard” -Al Feb 10, 2017 9:46 AM \nWhen does Greg Hardy’s plane touchdown!

The Raiders can certainly use him, but with Mack and Irvin they don’t fall apart if he’s gone. Hopefully he can keep it together. redlikethepig says: Feb 10, 2017 10:16 AM \nCan Joe Mixon be far behind? ricko1112 says: Feb 10, 2017 10:47 AM \nCome on!
