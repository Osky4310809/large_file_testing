Kayla says back in February 2016, she was sitting at her desk and was horrified to see her mentor, Mike -- a Delta employee for approximately 25 years -- had whipped out his penis and self-pleasured.\nKayla says she told Lauren about it and Lauren said Mike had done the same thing in her view.\nThe suit claims the 2 women reported the incidents and rather than the higher-ups taking it seriously, it became the subject of office jokes. They claim 2 Delta execs were joking in February 2016, where one said, \"I'm horny. Hey Peter, let me sit at your desk and rub one out by the window so everyone could see.\"\nThe women claim they were fired as retaliation for reporting Mike.\nThey're suing for more than $5 million.\nWe reached out to Delta.
