Simply because I didn’t know what the hell to pack! I sort of figured what not to pack — we’ll come to that later. But even before the suitcase was taken down from the loft, and the woollies located, I decided to scan my passport…just in case.\nThis precaution was taken after a long conversation with a highly distressed lady from Hyderabad who was in tears talking about her young daughter’s recent trauma as she tried to go back to her university in America after her spring break.\nShe had a couple of semesters left to finish, all her papers were in place. And yet, she was turned back from the airport when she landed in New York. Her mother was in tears and wondering what to do about the various stamps on the family’s visa pages. Yes, they had been to Syria on a pilgrimage. Iraq, too.\nINCREDIBLE INDIA: If Trumpland’s off your bucket list, try going local. Discover the Gir lion\nAnother lady helpfully suggested this solution: “Why not claim your daughter has lost her passport and apply for a new one?” Some of the others narrated similar problems and warned me to “be careful”. What does that even mean? ‘Be careful’ about what? My surname? My appearance? Something else?\nMy surname has caused a few embarrassing moments in the past, particularly in Europe, where I would be asked, “De? How can that be your family name? De WHAT?” I’d smile and say, “Just De. De nothing!” I’d get the European shrug and be waved through. Well, not always. I have had to step aside a countless number of times because my physical features confused computer screens.\nFrom, “Are you related to Benazir Bhutto? There is a resemblance. Have you ever lived in Pakistan?” to a more direct, “You must be from the Middle East originally. Lebanese? Syrian? Please come this way…” Not fun.\nLondon creates its own challenges these days. Wearing a saree (unless you are Sushma Swaraj) gets you rude stares in certain areas. Placing a bindi in the centre of your forehead is asking for target practice. Wearing a loose tunic with a Peshawari shalwar? Forget it! Even a more traditional salwar-suit attracts the occasional, “Bloody Paki… go home!” jibe.\nSince I don’t wear Hillary Clinton-style pant-suits, and I don’t possess Melania Trump’s amazing silhouette to be able to carry off fitted, super chic, powder-blue couture, I am stumped. I hate blue jeans. I have never worn ‘frocks’ – well, not after leaving school at any rate, so what do I pack without attracting trouble?\nOur weather-friendly chappals are a no-no. Open-toed sandals are permissible during summers in Capri. But the sight of bare feet deeply offends people in certain cultures. Open hair is another bugbear.\nKeeping my hair loose, without pinning or clipping the somewhat wild and unkempt strands is unacceptable to some — only wayward and wanton women do that (no problem, baby!). I have to avoid baring my arms, too. Or make sure I have a scarf handy to cover my exposed shoulders. A hat is always a good idea. But a hat with a saree?\nAnd that’s only the ‘look test’. Then comes the inquisition. Since my passport pages do feature stamps of interesting destinations, I’d better prep myself for some intense questioning. It won’t be enough to state frankly I went to XYZ place because I was attracted to its magnificent architecture/food/ bazaars.\nIt’s come to a point where I might be advised by a boorish immigration officer to stay home and watch travel shows on television instead of visiting countries Donald Trump does not approve of and may wish to bomb in the near future.\nThere are thousands of eager, adventurous people like me, who are rethinking their plans to discover places which have featured on their bucket list for decades. Travel in the time of Trump has taken on a whole new meaning.\nMeanwhile, the lady from Hyderabad is still struggling to find a solution. Her daughter’s education is in a state of limbo. There is one hell of a lot of serious money that seems to have gone down the drain. Even if America gets struck off many lists as a favourite tourist destination, Europe is only going to get tougher for us. What an irony! Much of Europe is borderline broke. As is Britain. They can do with our Indian rupees at this juncture. Phir bhi, they display such exaggerated ‘mizaaj’.\nSo, my friends, the writing is on the wall. The same one Trump is building. Stay home. Plan a Bharat darshan this summer. DeMo your nationalistic pride. Discover the Gir lion. Make out in India. Honeymoon travels ke achhe din are here again. Nothing like a Made in India baby to strengthen this great country of ours!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T05:14:19.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
