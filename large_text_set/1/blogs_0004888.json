DCLeaks did not immediately return a request for comment from TheDC. \nThe DNI report notes that the “high confidence” label “generally indicates that judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple sources. High confidence in a judgment does not imply that the assessment is a fact or a certainty; such judgments might be wrong.” \nThe Daily Caller was the first to report that Colin Powell’s hacked emails had been published by DCLeaks. Liberal outlets like The New York Times later used DCLeaks to report on the contents of Powell’s emails. In a story titled, “Colin Powell, in Hacked Emails, Shows Scorn for Trump and Irritation at Clinton,” the Times’ Michael Shear noted that “It is unclear who operates DCLeaks.com.” (RELATED: Exclusive: Colin Powell’s Personal Email Hacked) \nDCLeaks also published hacked documents from liberal financier George Soros’s Open Society Foundations in August.
