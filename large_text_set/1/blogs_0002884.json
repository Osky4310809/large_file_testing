City were in fine form at the London Stadium (Photo: Nigel French/PA) \n“It’s the only way in this kind of team. We are not strong enough, like the other ones. We are not fast enough, like the other ones. \n“We have to try to play with the ball, as much as possible, to win the games. If not, all the other contenders are stronger than us. \n“We can’t achieve our targets if we don’t play - and to play is to keep the ball.” The loss was West Ham's worst ever at home in the FA Cup (Photo: Ian Walton) \nCity sent West Ham tumbling to their worst ever home defeat in the FA Cup. \nThey went ahead after being awarded a controversial penalty by referee Michael Oliver when Pablo Zabaleta tumbled over in the box after colliding with Angelo Ogbonna. \nSlaven Bilic labelled the penalty as “soft” and the Hammers boss added: “The penalty was a very important point of the game, but it is hard to talk about that when you lose 5-0.” Bilic rued to first-half penalty decision (Photo: Ian Walton) \nHe added: “It’s very bad night for us. It’s hard to say anything positive when you have been beaten 5-0 at home. \n“Now it’s time for the team to show character. Fortunately we have had a few defeats like that. Bilic couldn't find anything positive from the performance (Photo: Dan Mullan) \n“After the Arsenal (5-1) one we showed character, quality and team spirit and went to Liverpool and after that game we had 10 points from four games. \n“Now it is time to do it again.” poll loading Should West Ham sack Slaven Bilic? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:18:29.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
