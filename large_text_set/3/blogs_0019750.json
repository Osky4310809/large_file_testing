Hart is a better keeper than Caballero or Bravo, but was bombed out on loan (Photo: PA Wire) Read More Rio Ferdinand says he felt sorry for John Stones during City's loss in Monaco \nSo when you go into the second leg of a Champions League knockout tie with Stones and career left-back Aleksandar Kolarov as your two centre-halves, you are asking for trouble. \nSurely a world class coach would recognise that his Achilles heel is his defence and do something to protect it, rather play five attackers? \nWith City 5-3 up going into Wednesday night, he should have been saying, ‘Monaco ran out of steam late in the first game. Let’s keep things tight maybe for 60, 65 minutes and then turn up the gas, make one or two tactical substitutions and go and win the game 1-0 or 2-0.’ \nThey were more than capable of doing that. \nLots of journalists and fans think Guardiola has reinvented football. \nFor me, he was just a guy who inherited Lionel Messi and built around him with some very good players from Barcelona’s B side and their Academy, and they became a world class team. City's gameplan for the second leg against Monaco was hugely naive (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Read More Guardiola blames Man City's lack of European experience after last-16 exit \nHe then went to Bayern Munich, who have a 60 to 70 per cent chance of winning the German title every season, and failed to make a dent on the Champions League. \nIn terms of what he does at teams that aren’t ready-built for him, he looks distinctly average. \nConceding six goals in two games is not elite level football or defending. \nAnd who has Guardiola made better this season? I can’t think of one City player over 20 or 30 games. \nFabian Delph came out with a bonkers comment in July, saying he had learnt more in the first three weeks under Guardiola than he had in his whole career to that point. \nThat may well be the case, but I have yet to see that translated onto the pitch by any of the players Guardiola has had for almost a year now.

Yes he did, but at Man City you have to try different things. \nYou have to get people working better on set-pieces, on individual defending, on defending as a team, on keeping the ball better even — something Guardiola is supposed to be amazing at.
