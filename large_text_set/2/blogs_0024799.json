The running \"feud\" between the two stars started on Kimmel's late-night show. Each night, Kimmel apologizes to Damon for running out of time for the \"Bourne Identity\" star. Finally, it led to Damon making a viral video with Kimmel's ex-girlfriend Sarah Silverman .\nFrom there, the two have played stunts on each other for years and have even attempted \"couple's counseling.\"\nSunday evening, during Kimmel's monologue, the late-show host called out his frenemy onstage to seemingly make peace while discussing how divided the country is right now.\n\"I'm not the man to unite this country, but it can be done,\" said Kimmel. \"If every person watching this show, I don't want to get too serious, but there are millions and millions of people watching right now, and if every one of you took a minute to reach out to one person you disagree with, someone you like and have a positive, considerate conversation, not as liberals or conservatives, as Americans, if we would all do that we could make America great again. We really could. It starts with us.\"\n\"Tonight, in the spirit of healing and bringing people together, I would like to bury the hatchet with someone I've had issues with,\" he continued as the camera panned over to Damon in the audience.\nABC\n\"I've known Matt for a long time now. I've known Matt so long [that] when I first met Matt I was the fat one,\" Kimmel said. \"And we've had problems. He's a selfish person. Those of you who've work with him know this. But Matt did something very unselfish and I want to commend him for it. For real.\"\nKimmel recalled how Damon could have starred in Oscar-nominated \"Manchester by the Sea,\" which is nominated for six Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor.\n\"He could have taken that lead actor part for himself, but he didn't,\" said Kimmel. \"He gave that role to Casey Affleck, his childhood friend. He handed what turned out to be a caliber role over to his friend and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead.\"\nDamon was quick to point out that Affleck had a ponytail of his own. ABC\nThat movie, of course, is \"The Great Wall,\" which recently bombed at the box office in the states. The movie cost a reported $150 million to make . Domestically, the film has grossed $34 million. The film is faring better overseas where it has grossed another $94 million.\n\"Smooth move, dumba--,\" said Kimmel.\nAhead of the Oscars Sunday evening, Matt Damon appeared on \"Ellen \" where he told her he hoped Kimmel screwed up during the show.\n\"I'm hoping that he messes up,\" said Damon. \"I'm going to be there a few rows deep hoping that he messes up. I may even throw things at him.\"\nRead the original article on INSIDER . Follow INSIDER on Facebook . Copyright 2017.
