(Win McNamee/Getty Images) If President Trump really cares about health care — and I’m afraid he doesn’t — the logical thing for him to do now is pick up the phone and call Nancy Pelosi.\nHe tried relying on Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) and the Republican majority in Congress to pass something, anything , that would allow the administration to put a win on the scoreboard and declare the issue settled. It didn’t work. It didn’t even come close to working, because even if the House had passed that Frankenstein’s monster of a bill, the Senate surely would have balked.\nThe fact is that after screaming “repeal and replace” at the top of their lungs for seven long years, Republicans have nothing approaching consensus on the “replace” part. Some want a full-monty libertarian approach, wherein we return to the days when Ol’ Doc made house calls and accepted payment in butter and chickens. Others apparently believe the problem is requiring health-insurance policies to cover maternity, which much of the Freedom Caucus seems to consider icky . Others believe the real imperative is ensuring that those who cannot afford to pay for care are made to endure as much humiliation as possible. And a few realize that all of the foregoing is nuts\nSo the Affordable Care Act remains in place. But it can and should be improved. It could even be replaced in a way that lets Trump keep a campaign promise — you know, the one about how there would be health care “ for everybody .”\nIf Trump is the populist maverick he claimed to be, he should call Minority Leader Pelosi (D-Calif.) and propose they work together in designing a truly universal system of health insurance that would be something like Sen. Bernie Sanders’s “Medicare for everyone” proposal\nSure, it would be hard to get every single House Democrat to agree to such a thing, and harder to snag the necessary couple-dozen Republican votes. But it couldn’t possibly be more difficult than getting the GOP to agree on anything. And yes, in the Senate it would be hard to assemble 60 votes, but hear me out.\nI believe it has begun to penetrate the popular consciousness that compared to the United States, every advanced nation on Earth delivers universal care, for less money, often with better outcomes. Republican officials would self-immolate in rage at the very idea, but one of Trump’s insights during the campaign was that the GOP base is not allergic to government services.\nThe flaw in my plan is that to create such a revolution in health care would take at least a year of sustained effort, perhaps more. Trump would have to really care about the issue, and he would have to radically lengthen his attention span. But if he really wants to be a transformative president, fulfill a big promise and leave a lasting mark, I’m sure Pelosi would be glad to take his call.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@Eugene_Robinson"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:43:04.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
