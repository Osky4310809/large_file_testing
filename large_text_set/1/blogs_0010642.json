So you can imagine how insanely happy it made us to discover that Damon and Affleck still hang out on the regs .\nThat’s right. According to an interview with Affleck for US Magazine , the two will use what little down time they have each week to just chill out and watch Sunday football. And while that might sound like NBD, it kind of warms our hearts to know that two kids who grew up together in Boston still genuinely enjoy spending time together.\nSpecifically, the interviewer asked Affleck: “What’s a perfect day like for you when you’re not working and not with your kids?”\nTo which he said, “I don’t know if that day ever comes.
