We have been meeting all of the standards, it’s just the state has indicated some of our readings were showing irregularities and they wanted us to provide this boil water order and an abundance of caution,” says Weimar. \nWeimar adds they will be working with the state until the issue is resolved. \nCustomers with questions can go to the PWSA website at www.pgh2o.com or call Customer Service at (412)-255-2423. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter Lisa Washington Lisa Washington joined KDKA TV in May of 2015.
