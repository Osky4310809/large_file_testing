It’s a story about Green Beret, Matt Bessler, and his service dog, Mike. Mike is credited for saving hundreds of lives sniffing out over 2,000 lbs. of explosives in Iraq. Matt and Mike retired to a quiet community in Wyoming. \nOne day, a disturbed neighbor carrying a shotgun strapped to the handlebars of his bike shot and killed Mike for no reason. He was never arrested or charged. 8 \nWe are building one of the first War Dog Memorials of it’s kind to honor the memory of this amazing dog. And I think we should build a big, strong, memorial in Wyoming to remember war dogs everywhere – A towering memorial so when that man rides his bike by it everyday, he can’t miss it.
