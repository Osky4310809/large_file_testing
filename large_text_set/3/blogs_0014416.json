When a question was thrown to him, that hasn’t Modi raised too many expectations in 2014, he replied “It is great that we are living in an era pf expectations. This is a government that takes risks and the biggest risk is not taking a risk and this is the reason why I am positive of Modi,” he said replying to the question at a discussion being held at the India Today conclave. When asked about a message that he would like to give to NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, Mahindra said, “Get a global advisory council for NITI Aayog on the lines of Singapore”. \nThis is not the first time that he has been seen speaking in support of Narendra Modi. Recently, he was seen praising PM’s demonetisation drive. He said that demonetisation is a very bold move which everyone should respect. In a tweet, Mahindra said, “Urgent message to anyone who robbed a bank tonight: You just got robbed.” In a separate tweet a few days later Mahindra said, “Demonetization, apart from attacking black money , is a significant move against counterfeiting & terror financing. It deserves citizen support.” \nYou may also like to watch: \nNot just this, when Modi launched BHIM app – a biometric payment system using the Aadhaar platform, Mahindra was quick to tweet. “Just downloaded the BHIM app on my pixel. What if this were to become the most widely used payment app in India–& then the world?” he wrote. To this, BHIM developers replied with a thank you note and said: “thank you for the wishes! We are working hard to improve the user experience even more!”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:54:45.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
