Natalie Portman starred in James Blake’s new music video for the song “My Willing Heart” and she looks totally amazing . We also love this low key acting gig for the super talented actress who probably has her pick of the litter in movie roles.\nThe music video for “My Willing Heart” was shot only days before Natalie gave birth t o her daughter, Amalia, so we imagine the video is pretty special to her too! The track was co-written by Frank Ocean and it’s from Blake’s latest album, The Colour in Anything, that came out a little less than a year ago.\nConsidering most of us only have grainy photographs and amateurish home videos to watch of our families before they were, y’know, our families, we’re sure Amalia is going to think this peek into her mom’s life just days before she was born is amazingly cool once she’s old enough to appreciate it.\nWe also love that this video was directed by a woman: Anna Rose Holmer. Congratulations to Natalie on both this stunning vid and her new little girl!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:02:56.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
