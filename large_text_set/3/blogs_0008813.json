The spots are called \"Unleash\" and \"Time For Power', and put the action sequences squarely in the spotlight. \nThe first clip, \"Unleash\", shows off the initial revelation of the Zords, with Alpha 5 doing the honors of course. The previously shown Goldar fight also gets a few pieces of new footage, with the Pink Ranger and Black Ranger working together to drop the Mastodon Zord right atop of the enormous enemy. The five Rangers can also be seen approaching the massive enemy right before the spot concludes. \nIn the second spot, \"Time For Power\", fans get a much closer look at what appears to be the initial Putties battle, with all the Rangers getting some hits in before the new spot ends. The Red Ranger can also be seen using his sword, though the other Rangers don't seem to be using their weapons. Rita Repulsa also makes a guest appearance before the spot concludes. \nYou can view the \"Unleash\" spot above, and hit the next slide for the \"Time For Power\" spot as well as new screens from both. Power Rangers currently holds a 3.47 out of 5 on ComicBook.com's anticipation rankings , and you can view the official description below. \n\"Saban’s Power Rangers follows five ordinary high school kids who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove – and the world – is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover that they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so they will have to overcome their real-life issues and band together as the Power Rangers before it is too late.\" \nPower Rangers stars Bryan Cranston (Zordon), Elizabeth Banks (Rita Repulsa), Naomi Scott (Kimberly/Pink Ranger), David Denman (Sam Scott), Becky G. (Trini/Yellow Ranger), Sarah Grey (Amanda), RJ Cyler (Billy Cranston/Blue Ranger), Emily Maddison (Rebecca), Ludi Lin (Zack Taylor/Black Ranger), and Dacre Montgomery (Jason Lee Scott/Red Ranger). \nPower Rangers is set to land in theaters on March 24, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:13:41.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
