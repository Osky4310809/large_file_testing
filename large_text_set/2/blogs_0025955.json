However, we mustn't forget that where there is a huge awards show, there is a legendary afterparty—filled with even more stars and the requisite beauty looks that go along. This year's Oscars red carpet brought us an influx of bold red lips and surprising washes of color , but Nina Dobrev's Vanity Fair Oscars party appearance was all about that flawless dewy glow tho. Dobrev's skin looked absolutely stunning as she walked down the red carpet in a white Dior dress, showing off off her new A-line bob inspired by Audrey Hepburn. Normally, skin this glowy is the result of a 12-step , triple-digit-price-tag facial, but luckily for us, Dobrev's swoonworthy strobing effect comes courtesy of an affordable highlighter you can find at your nearest drugstore. For this light-catching luminosity, celebrity makeup artist Spencer Barnes applied E.L.F. Baked Highlighter in Moonlight Pearls atop the cheeks, the bridge of the nose, and the upper lip—adeptly proving just what a difference the lightest touch of highlighter can make. That's right, fellow beauty junkies: You can get Dobrev's red carpet glow for just four bucks. I'm guessing that's less than you spent on coffee this morning.
