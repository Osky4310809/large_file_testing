PPD/Ace Morandante \nMANILA, Philippines – Faced with the challenge to improve the lives of Filipinos amidst human rights concerns over his bloody war on drugs, President Duterte yesterday underscored the need to improve peace and order to push the country’s development. \nDuterte welcomed the New Year by asking the people to be the government’s partners in the fight against illegal drugs, crime and corruption. \nDuterte, in his New Year’s message, urged everyone to welcome 2017 with renewed determination and a reinvigorated spirit for the country to surmount the challenges ahead. \nThe President batted for his administration’s goals amid the concern of human rights groups over his campaign against illegal drugs that has claimed thousands of lives, including those of innocent children. \nHe had asked for forgiveness for the “unintentional” deaths in the war on drugs. \nBut the Commission on Human Rights said Duterte’s apology was not enough and the government should hold those responsible for the killings accountable.   \n“The achievement of these goals will reclaim order and safety in our communities and will enable us to restore the people’s trust in government and in our people’s capacity to serve,” said Duterte. \n“My warmest greetings to the Filipino people, here in the Philippines and across the globe, as we celebrate the New Year,” Duterte said. “Indeed, there is no greater happiness than spending time with our loved ones during the holiday season.” \n“I hope that we will all enjoy the time of the year by demonstrating love, solidarity, understanding, happiness and optimism toward our personal ambitions and national aspirations,” he added. \nThe President said that while others might forget the events of the past year, those in government would always remember them. \n“Soon, we will be pre-occupied with our daily grind and usual day-to-day activities. Many will forget the events of the past year. But we, in government, will remember because it is our duty to evaluate our work and make sure that its gains redound to the common good,” he said. \nDuterte arrived in Davao City Friday night after visiting the victims of an explosion during a fiesta celebration in Hilongos, Leyte. \nThe President celebrated New Year’s Eve at his home in Davao City with his family. Concern for OFWs \nIn his first New Year message as president, Duterte talked about his dream of providing better lives for the millions of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who have decided to leave their families to earn a living. \nDuterte expressed hope that no Filipino would leave for abroad to work. \n“Let us work together to enliven our business environment -- by attracting more investments and creating more job opportunities for the people – so that in the near future, working abroad would only be an option for our kababayans and not a necessity,” he said. Palace hopes for better 2017 \nWith the President given leeway in his P3.35-trillion budget for change, a Malacañang official expressed hope that the lives of Filipinos would improve this year. \n“As the President walked the extra mile for peace, he made the country’s economic growth the fastest among emerging Asian economies and lowered unemployment rate to its lowest level in more than a decade,” Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said. \nIn television interviews on Thursday, Duterte said the economy has grown ny up to seven percent of the GDP. \nAlthough he and his economic managers noted a slight dip in the numbers, Duterte said he expects more public spending to happen this year. \nAndanar noted how the Duterte administration unveiled a budget to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure and bring forth the promise of real change in the country.” \n“The President hit the ground running in the first six months and we expect much more will be done in the succeeding months and years,” Andanar said in a statement. \nThe Palace official said Duterte’s passion to serve would continue to benefit the Filipinos. \nAndanar also said the President’s efforts to unify the people by striking peace agreements with the Moro groups and the communist rebels have started to pay off. \nAndanar said the nation has witnessed drastic changes in public governance characterized by courageous and compassionate leadership since Duterte assumed the presidency on June 30. \nDuterte launched an unprecedented anti-drug war that saw the surrender of more than a million drug addicts, and charted a new course in international relations with his pursuit of an independent foreign policy. \nThe President has started moving strongly and swiftly toward regional economic rebalancing for closer integration. The Philippines has forged closer ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan and Russia. \nTo restore faith in government, Andanar noted how Duterte moved the bureaucracy to effectively implement programs that benefit the poorest. \n“Basic services, formerly broken or unavailable, are working. More passengers are being served by the railway system while driver’s license cards are ready for pick up. Free education, hospitalization and medicine as well as irrigation are within the grasp of the marginalized and the poor,” Andanar said. PNP seeks public support \nPhilippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa called on the people yesterday to continue supporting the PNP’s campaign against drugs and crime. \n“Let us learn from the lessons of the past year to strengthen the unity of the people and police,” Dela Rosa said in his New Year’s message. \nDespite the challenges faced by the PNP last year, Dela Rosa is confident there will be more accomplishments for the police force in 2017. \nHe believes Filipinos can surpass the challenges that may come this year. \n“Let’s all welcome the New Year with hope,” he said. – With Edith Regalado, Emmanuel Tupas  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-12-31T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T00:36:19.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
