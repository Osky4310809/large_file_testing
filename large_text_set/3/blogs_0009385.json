Next season, Munnerlyn will be back where his career began as he has agreed to a contract with the Carolina Panthers. — Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) March 11, 2017 \nMunnerlyn's contract with the Panthers is reported to be a four year deal worth $21 million with a $6 million signing bonus. \nAccording to St. Paul Pioneer Press reporter Chris Tomasson, Munnerlyn said it was a deal that he simply couldn't turn down. Captain Munnerlyn: \"In terms of the contract (4yr $21M), I couldn't turn it down. It was a good deal. I have a home in Charlotte.'' — Chris Tomasson (@christomasson) March 11, 2017 \nWith Munnerlyn leaving, the Vikings will need to fill the void at the nickel defensive back position, one which many would now assume will be filled by second-year corner Mackensie Alexander. \nAlexander finished last year with just five total tackles.
