But others noticed that the sole source for that assertion was a quote from a former Trump transition official that wasn’t quite as strong as the Times ‘ claim. “If you asked him on that first day he said yes, he would have said, ‘I want to be an advocate for energy,’” Michael McKenna told them. “If you asked him now, he’d say, ‘I’m serious about the challenges facing the nuclear complex.’ It’s been a learning curve.” \nMcKenna later told The Daily Caller that his remarks were taken out of context and “of course” Perry knew what the job entailed when he took it. Washington Examiner media critic T. Becket Adams noted that McKenna wasn’t even part of the transition team when Perry was named, and that Perry’s original statement specifically mentioned that he’d oversee the nuclear arsenal. Also, it’s worth noting NYT’s source was booted from the Trump transition team in Nov. Perry was picked in December: https://t.co/djbeIIPJ2l \n— T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) January 19, 2017 Anyway, I’ll leave you this morning with this Dec. 14, 2016, quote from Perry. Issued the day he was asked to head DoE. Note the highlight. pic.twitter.com/z3qiw8sM1a \n— T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) January 19, 2017 \nThe backlash was swift, mostly from conservatives but also from some liberals who spread the initial story. Thin, thin gruel. A guy who wasn’t there thinks Rick Perry might have thought a thing and might answer a question this way. FIT TO PRINT! \n— Mary Katharine Ham (@mkhammer) January 19, 2017 It took two writers to make up that Perry story. Two. \n— Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) January 19, 2017 So while I was gone NYT essentially fabricated an entire story about how Rick Perry didn’t understand DoE. And the Left happily spread it \n— Jeff B/DDHQ (@EsotericCD) January 19, 2017 That NYT hit on Perry was the very definition of fake news. Many political reporters spread it. https://t.co/udJUXr79fs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T18:12:55.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
