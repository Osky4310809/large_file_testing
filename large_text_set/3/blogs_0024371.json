AP/File \nMANILA, Philippines - The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has prepared a “predictive analytics” for its humanitarian response in the event that the Big One, or the 7.2-magnitude earthquake, hits Metro Manila and nearby areas. \nBased on the analytics, the areas that will experience the greatest impact are Metro Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, Laguna, Rizal, Pampanga, Zambales and Aurora. A total of 5,828,967 families will be affected. \nIn Metro Manila alone, 2,570,188 families will experience the impact of the massive disaster. \nThis number includes 585,017 families in Quezon City, 351,615 in Manila, 314,842 in Caloocan, 160,683 in Taguig, 159,973 families in Pasig, 49,513 in Navotas, 24,373 in San Juan and 12,744 in Pateros. \nAffected families will require 5.8 million family food packs worth P2,098,428,120 in the first two days alone. \nIn a statement, Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo said the DSWD has been coordinating with the National Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) regarding preparations for the earthquake that could be triggered by the West Valley Fault.   \n“This makes the agency better equipped to provide what assistance the Filipinos will need if and when the earthquake hits.” \n“DSWD has handled disasters of huge magnitude and scope before, and we will tap the collective experience and strength of the entire agency to rise to the task of helping Filipinos should the Big One strike,” she said. \n“As all disasters are local in nature, our team, together with other members of the NDRRMC, is now making the rounds of communities to educate the different barangays on the steps they need to take so that they can be more prepared against the earthquake. We must strengthen the capabilities of communities and help them be more resilient,” she added.
