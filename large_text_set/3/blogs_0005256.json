Check out the latest deals here . Juve, Liverpool, Dortmund vie for Inaki Williams \nJuventus are preparing a major bid for Inaki Williams , according to Mundo Deportivo , with the Old Lady thought to be ready to trigger the 22-year-old's €50 million release clause. \nThe report suggested that Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund are also interested in the Spain under-21 forward, who would represent one of the biggest signings of the summer. \nThe Basque club are notorious for their refusal to negotiate with rivals regarding the price of their key players, which is why the Italian giants, or any other club interested, will have to pay the full amount of the clause. \nWilliams has five goals and five assists in 38 appearances across all competitions this term, and he has the ability to play wide right and through the middle. Galaxy look to lure Ibrahimovic \nLA Galaxy are trying to prize Zlatan Ibrahimovic away from Manchester United, sources have told to ESPN FC , in a move that would make the Swede the highest-paid player in MLS history. Brian McBride says MLS players have self-preservation in mind when welcoming DPs to the league. \nThe 35-year-old has yet to commit to a further season at Old Trafford, despite a remarkable debut campaign in England that has included 26 goals in all competitions. \nThe Galaxy were interested in Ibrahimovic before he opted to join Man United last summer after letting his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expire, and they might finally get their man. 'Ox' to join Alexis, Ozil through Emirates exit \nAmid the furore surrounding Arsenal's catastrophic Champions League exit, the first signs of unrest appear to have developed, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain keen to leave this summer, according to ESPN FC sources . \nThe Gunners midfielder was one of the few to emerge with any credit from Tuesday's capitulation at the hands of Bayern Munich, and the 23-year-old has just one year remaining on his deal. \nChamberlain will join both Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez out the door as Arsenal prepare for a squad overhaul as another season unravels under Arsene Wenger. It has been revealed that Ozil has also failed to respond to a £200,000-per-week offer for a new deal, with the German eager to move on this summer. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is reportedly ready to follow Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez out of Arsenal this summer. Juve to raid Milan for De Sciglio \nJuventus are set to make an audacious move for AC Milan's Mattia De Sciglio , Corriere dello Sport claimed, in a bid to bring in their full-back of the future. \nThe Italy international has just one year remaining on his contract and could represent a bargain buy, given that the Rossoneri will be forced to sell now or risk allowing the 24-year-old to leave for free in 2018. \nDespite an inconsistent couple of seasons, De Sciglio has outstanding potential and the versatility to play on either flank. General director Beppe Marotta is ready to risk riling their domestic rivals for a homegrown player who would consolidate the Bianconeri 's presence in the national team. Tap-ins \n-- Newcastle will move for Nottingham Forest starlet Ben Osborn this summer once they have secured promotion back to the Premier League, the Mirror claimed. Rafael Benitez is a huge admirer of the 22-year-old and tried to bring the midfielder to St James' Park in January. The Magpies will reignite their interest once the window reopens. \n-- Rangers striker Kenny Miller could be set for a summer move for Hibernian, the Express claimed, with the veteran Scot set to be out of contract. The 37-year-old started his career at Easter Road before his first of three spells with the Gers, but with no new deal forthcoming, despite nine goals in all competitions this term, Miller might opt to head home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:11:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
