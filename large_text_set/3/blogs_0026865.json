The passengers (Sunday) were United pass riders and not in compliance with our dress code for company benefit travel.” \nUnited added: “We regularly remind our employees that when they place a family member or friend on a flight for free as a standby passenger, they need to follow our dress code.” To our customers…your leggings are welcome!

I don’t care what kind of passengers they were. https://t.co/9VwGKgvWys \n— Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 26, 2017 2) This behavior is sexist and sexualizes young girls. Not to mention that the families were mortified and inconveninced. \n— Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 26, 2017 \nThe situation drew reaction from thousands — including celebrities — and was trending on Twitter. \n“I applaud @united for making those girls change their leggings,” comedian Jim Norton said on Twitter. “Nothing on a plane offends me more than a comfortable woman.” Understandable. It’s just that saying a dad in cargo shorts is more appropriate than a 10 y/o girl in leggings is weird maybe rethink https://t.co/U1xzH5P6Ar \n— Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) March 27, 2017 \nOthers posted on social media that they would be flying United in leggings in protest. \nFueling the controversy on Sunday were initial United tweets in response to Watts that lacked context in which United said it “shall have the right to refuse passengers if they are not properly clothed via our Contract of Carriage.” \nSeveral media outlets also posted stories online that initially lacked the pass traveler information or comment from United. @united You’re just repeating a simplistic & disingenuous claim. Rules DON’T mention leggings. She was a CHILD! You let a guy in shorts on. \n— Mark Hughes (@markhughesfilms) March 27, 2017 @dwaynebenji As you aren’t a pass traveler, your attire doesn’t need to meet the United pass travel clothing requirements. See you soon. ^AH \nOther airline passengers said on social media that it’s not unusual for pass travelers to be barred from wearing leggings, or other clothing like flip flops, on flights.
