He chose Midtown as his crime scene because Manhattan is the media capital of the world, and a place where people of different races live together and love one another.” \nJackson turned himself in to police in Times Square, telling officers they needed to arrest him and that he had knives in his pocket. \nInvestigators later found a 26-inch mini-sword they said he used to stab Caughman in the back while he was collecting bottles to recycle. \nThe Baltimore man later told police he was angered by black men dating white women. \nIf found guilty of the top charge, Jackson faces a mandatory life sentence in prison. \nHe was scheduled to be arraigned on the indictment in Manhattan Supreme Criminal Court Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:11:50.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
