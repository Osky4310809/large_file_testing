The Ganges river dolphin was officially discovered in 1801. Ganges river dolphins once lived in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. But the species is extinct from most of its early distribution ranges. There are only about 1,800 Ganges river dolphins left and numbers are still falling. Unsurprisingly, humans are responsible. A proliferation of damming projects along the Ganges along with constant pesticide and fertiliser run-off makes the river a harsh and difficult place to live. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, 9,000 tons of toxic pesticides and 6 million tons of fertiliser are used near the Ganges every year.The Ganges river dolphin is struggling to cope with destructive dams, overfishing, pollution and hunting, much the same things that exterminated the baiji. Most of these also have an impact on the people who depend on the Ganges. Protecting this iconic species would also protect one of India&rsquo;s most vital ecosystems and the people and animals that depend on it. \nIf the river dolphin is to be saved, immediate action to reduce pollution, address unsustainable fishing methods and stop further destructive development is essential. \nI ask you to join me in this stand to save the Ganges River Dolphin. I hope that you will learn from the irreversible mistakes of other countries and take the lead in conservation initiatives. Together, we can prevent the extinction of this beautiful species.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:59:45.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
