Gmail now accepts attachments up to 50 MB \nEverytown for Gun Safety , a gun safety and gun control nonprofit backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, faced an awkward decision while working with Snapchat last year, according to leaked emails obtained by Mic . \nEverytown was collaborating with the Snapchat news team on a “Guns in America” Live Story tied to National Gun Violence Awareness Day . This prompted Snapchat’s head of political sales Rob Saliterman (who’d already been discussing an ad campaign with Everytown) to send an email to Everytown that said, “I would urgently like to speak with you about advertising opportunities within the story, as there will be three ad slots. We are also talking to the NRA about running ads within the story.” \nThe nonprofit said that the ads would be out of its budget, and it also expressed concern about the possible NRA ads. Saliterman, who previously held a similar role at Google, said that “the story has the potential to be bought by any advertiser, including the NRA,” but added, “The advertising will not impact the editorial content within the story as our teams are independent.” \nWhen we reached out to Snapchat’s parent company Snap Inc., a spokesperson argued there was no breakdown here in the division between the editorial and advertising teams. Instead, they said the editorial team created their calendar independently, then sent it to the ad team to sell advertising on those stories.

Snap explored selling a 360 camera The NRA then found out about the story through the normal sales channels and expressed interest in buying one of the ads, which are available on a first-come, first-served basis (assuming they meet Snapchat’s political guidelines ). In Snap’s view, Saliterman was simply providing Everytown with information that it would want to know.\nNone of Snap’s account seems to be contradicted by Mic’s reporting — and to be clear, the article doesn’t really suggest that Snap let the ad team influence editorial. So why is this getting attention? Perhaps because there’s something unseemly, or just plain gross, about considering an NRA ad for this particular Live Story — and then using that possibility as a negotiating point. \nIn fact, while a spokesperson for Everytown declined to comment, Snap said that the organization did end up contributing to the “Guns in America” story after all.
