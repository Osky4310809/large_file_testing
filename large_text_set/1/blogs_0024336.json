Plan to start digging in a month or so,\" he tweeted . \nYou might think that Musk is joking. I might even join you. However, asked by Twitterers about where the digging would start, he replied : \"Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX.\" \nI'm sure the construction work will be extremely helpful to traffic in the short term. Still, Musk was asked: \"So you were serious? Like seriously serious.\" \nHe replied expansively : \"Yup.\" \nAnd when asked whether LA's penchant for tremors might get in the way of this idea, Musk explained : \"Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. That's why LA can have a (lame, but getting better) subway.\" Some offered their version of humor. \"Does it go under Mexico?\" asked Twitter user Taoboat. \nStill, not everyone was convinced. \" More than one Twitterer wondered if the tunnel would head for Mexico.
