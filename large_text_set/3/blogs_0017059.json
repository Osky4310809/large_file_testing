The U.S. is continually gathering new intelligence about that effort, the officials said. \n\"This is something they could have decided to do last month, or never,\" one U.S. official said. \"There is no new critical piece of intelligence, but at the same time there are bad people trying to do bad things.\" \nAt least some element of the general threat points back to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and its master bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, two of the officials said. Al-Asiri, who is believed responsible for two bombs hidden in U.S.-bound cargo planes in 2010, is believed to have taught others some of his techniques, they added. The cargo plane bombs were discovered before they could go off.
