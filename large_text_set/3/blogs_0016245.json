(Jason Johnson via Periscope) Amazonâ€™s Prime Air drone made its first package delivery in December , in England, but regular folks havenâ€™t seen it in action out in the open here in the States. Until today.\nThe drone demonstrated its delivery technique during Amazonâ€™s MARS 2017 conference at a resort in Palm Springs, Calif. The merchandise? A box containing sunscreen for the sunny California weather, of course.\nAmazon has been providing video of its prototype drones for well more than a year, and the testing continues in the U.S. and Britain as well as other countries. However, the previous glimpses weâ€™ve gotten have been professionally packaged videos , created by Amazon.\nIn contrast, the video we saw today was basically a smartphone clip shot by Jason Johnson , whoâ€™s the founder and CEO of August Home (and an attendee at MARS 2017).\nAmazon Prime Air drone delivery https://t.co/A04FSdcqRq \nâ€” Jason Johnson (@jcjohnson) March 20, 2017 \nYou can see the quadcopter flying in over a lawn at the resort, touching down on a target square, dropping off its package and then flying away. Another attendee, Caltech researcher Christine Corbett Moran, reports that there was sunscreen inside the package. ( On her website , Corbett Moran reports that sheâ€™s a finalist for NASAâ€™s next astronaut candidate class, due to be named in June .)\nCorbett Moran also got a chance to take a walk on a virtual Mars, and sit in the pilot seat of the giant Method-2 robot that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos rode in on the night before.\nFirst drone delivery: sunscreen for sunny Palm Springs pic.twitter.com/y0EQqlzJKT \nâ€” @corbett:explore ðŸš€ (@corbett) March 20, 2017 \nTime to take over the world.

When the service goes commercial, itâ€™s expected to deliver packages in 30 minutes or less, using flying robots that can travel up to 50 mph.\nIt shouldnâ€™t be a surprise that Amazon is providing a sneak peek at its delivery drones at MARS 2017 . Amazon is presenting the semi-secret conference this week to show off technologies in M achine learning, home A utomation, R obotics and S pace exploration.for a select audience.
