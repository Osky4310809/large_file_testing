Cup in place of Ashley Cole aged just 18, Luke Shaw looked to have it all. PA:Press Association Archive Luke Shaw’s time at Manchester United will come to an end this summer \nSomething, somewhere, has gone very wrong with his career. Keep up to date with all the latest news, gossip, rumours and done deals in SunSport’s live transfer blog \nThe end of a tortuous spell at Manchester United — the termination of his relationship with Jose Mourinho — cannot come soon enough. \nBoss Mourinho will happily wave him on his way. \nThis summer will be Shaw’s chance to start afresh, to leave the Special One behind and start playing first-team football again. \nShaw would dearly love to be reunited with Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham . Saturday Premier League match preview featuring Liverpool v Everton Reuters 7 Jose Mourinho has had enough of dealing with the left-back \nThey have a special relationship, a rapport built during the defender’s rapid progress when he was a young player at Southampton . \nShaw, earning £130,000-a-week at Old Trafford following his initial £27million move from St Mary’s, is desperate to work with him again. \nPoch got the best out of his protege on the South Coast, putting structure into his life and teaching him how to become a top-class professional. \nThe days of Shaw running through the bushes after training and picking up two bags of wine gums on the way home were over when the Argentine arrived in English football. \nInstead he nurtured him, believing in his ability and giving him the confidence to play for Southampton’s first team when he was still only 17.

Action Images 7 Shaw would love the chance to work with Mauricio Pochettino once again \nMarcus Rojo , Daley Blind and Matteo Darmian have all been preferred to him at left-back during another difficult season. \nBehind the scenes, the tension with Mourinho remains. \nThey have never really found a way past the meeting with Shaw and his family in 2014, that ended sourly when Mourinho was Chelsea manager. \nWith Shaw’s Surrey roots and his well-known affection for the Blues as his boyhood club, a transfer from the Saints to Stamford Bridge looked like a tap-in. \nInstead, Mourinho was left angered by the youngster’s apparent pre- occupation with money instead of the chance to move to Chelsea. PA:Press Association 7 Shaw looked out of shape during his brief England cameo last week \nIn return, Shaw’s family were not impressed by Mourinho and were never quite convinced he was his preferred target. Their relationship has never really recovered. \nThe latest run-in came following the 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on March 4, when United’s manager laid into him after he started talking to some of Eddie Howe’s players. \nShaw, who was shocked by the outburst, has not played a single minute since then. \nMourinho’s demands are high, with his record of winning trophies over the years giving him significant clout in the dressing room. PA:Press Association 7 The best thing for Shaw would be a fresh start with the guarantee of regular action \nHe is entitled to expect every Manchester United player to be the ultimate professional, fully focused and committed to meeting the enormous demands of the club. \nThe Special One has not had that from Shaw. \nThe left-back has retreated into his shell, with his confidence shaken after failing to settle into that famous red shirt. \nFor that reason, Shaw has to start all over again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:30:24.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
