DerriLynnee August 11, 2012 at 10:08 pm \nLeonardo DaVinci was said to be very good looking. \nThis is said by one of DaVinci’s contemporaries of his physical appearance after his meeting DaVinci in Pavia: “He was very attractive. Well-proportioned, graceful, and good looking. He wore a short rose-pink tunic, knee length at a time when most people wore long gowns. He had beautiful curling hair, carefully styled, which came down to the middle of his chest.” \nAccording to Giorgio Vasari, of his physical appearance: “In the normal course of events many men and women are born with various remarkable qualities and talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by heaven with beauty, grace and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind… Everyone acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty who displayed infinite grace in everything he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied were solved with ease. He possessed great strength and dexterity; he was a man of regal spirit and tremendous breadth of mind…” from wikipedia. – think Viggo Mortensen!!!- \nUnlike what most people are told, DaVinci was painted MANY times by his students, & contemporaries in Religious Art! His face was “lent” repeatedly to Christ, God, St. John the Baptist, St. Roch, St. Nicholas, and St. Ambrose, and others. – He was very good looking. In the many religious paintings by Bernardino Luini, he uses the face of his friend and teacher, Leonardo DaVinci. He is honored and immortalized as Christ, or St. Joseph, and more Catholic saints. This is a fact, but it is not well known. \nIf you want to see DaVinci’s face – look at the works of Bernardino Luini and the works of DaVinci’s students! \nMaybe one day this will become common knowledge… again. But, maybe not – people want Da Vinci to be an athiet and not to have remained in the Catholic tradition and culture, of which there is absolutely no proof and it is highly unlikey since he died in 1519, before the Reformation. (I am not Catholic to say this)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T09:15:30.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
