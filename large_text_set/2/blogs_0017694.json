Wouldn’t you stay away?\"\nThe star comic further wondered why Melania still hasn't moved into the White House.\n\"That's pretty bad. I mean, think about it: Hillary Clinton didn't move out of the White House and her husband got a blowjob in it.\"\nHe also mentioned Barron Trump appears publicly unengaged with audiences, Fox News reports. \nApatow said: \"You ever see the look on his face when Trump’s talking? \n\"People are like, \"Is there something wrong with him?\" No! He knows his dad’s a f g a e!\"\nThe comedian did not hesitate to lambast Barron during his routine, despite the recent suspension of a \"Saturday Night Live\" writer over her negative comments about the ten-year-old. \nThe producer presented the show while promoting his new HBO series \"Crashing,\" the Daily Beast reports.\nDuring the roast, Apatow said Trump only laughs after insulting someone.\n\"Laughter is how we connect, it's how you show people you love them,\" he said.\n\"[Trump] only laughs when he makes someone feel bad. What does he do to laugh, just go on YouTube and watch Special Olympics bloopers?\"\nSome Twitter observers called Apatow's routine a \"slap in the face\" and \"completely humiliating to every victim of rape.\"\nOne Twitter user defended Barron Trump by saying that comedians should not address children in their routines. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:50:23.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
