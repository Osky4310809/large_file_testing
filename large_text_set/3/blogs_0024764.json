You were over there I think, when I predicted that, right, the day before.\" Trump loves to say he predicted Brexit when he was in Scotland \"the day before.\" But he was not there the day before . This didn't happen. \n8. \"Brexit, I predicted Brexit, you remember that, the day before the event. I said, no, Brexit is going to happen, and everybody laughed, and Brexit happened.\" This is all kind of funny if you believe we live in a simulation. \n7. \"I got attacked on Brexit, when I was saying, I said long before the day before, I said the day before the opening, but I was saying Brexit was going to pass, and everybody was laughing, and I turned out to be right on that.\" [swear words]\n6. \"I mean mostly they register wrong, in other words, for the votes, they register incorrectly, and/or illegally. And they then vote. You have tremendous numbers of people.\" Trump has never provided any evidence to show illegal voting happened on a widespread scale during this past presidential election, or any other election. Such evidence does not exist . This debate has been beaten to death, resurrected and beaten to death again. There is no debate, because it is dead. Yay.\n5. \"I assume this is going to be a cover too, have I set the record? I guess, right? Covers, nobody’s had more covers.\" Former President Richard Nixon has many more covers . When this was pointed out to Trump, he said he was \"sure\" he would \"win.\"\n4. \"Sweden. I make the statement, everyone goes crazy. The next day they have a massive riot, and death, and problems.\" Well, see, the president made a statement about some kind of terrorist attack in Sweden that did not happen . Then, days later there was a riot in Sweden, though no one died. \n3. \"When I said wiretapping, it was in quotes. Because a wiretapping is, you know today it is different than wire tapping. It is just a good description. But wiretapping was in quotes. What I’m talking about is surveillance. \" It was in quotes, sure, until it wasn't. \n2. \"No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he’s a friend of mine. But that was in the newspaper. I wasn’t, I didn’t say that. I was referring to a newspaper. A Ted Cruz article referred to a newspaper story with, had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast.\" Trump once tried to connect Sen. Ted Cruz to Lee Harvey Oswald (the man who fatally shot former President John F. Kennedy). Trump cited The National Enquirer . \n1. \"I’m a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right.\" :)\nWATCH: Paranoid like 'Snowden'?
