Sheen 30th March 2017, 9:49 am Updated: 30th March 2017, 10:57 am Comments LEYTON ORIENT have confirmed that Danny Webb has resigned from the League Two crisis club. \nSunSport broke the news on Wednesday night that Webb intended to step down from The O’s after a bust-up with controversial owner Francesco Becchetti. Rex Features Danny Webb has resigned from Leyton Orient after a bust-up with owner Francesco Becchetti Getty Images 5 Controversial millionaire owner Francesco Becchetti was meddling in team selection and Webb had enough \nIn a statement on the club website, Orient confirmed that assistant boss Omer Riza will take over first-team duties “until the end of the season”– he becomes the crisis club’s FIFTH manager of the season. \nThe club said: “[Riza is] very determined to make sure that the team finishes the season strong and he’s looking forward for the challenge.” \nWebb leaves Brisbane road after Italian Bechetti again began meddling in team affairs, telling him who he wanted to be played. \nLike Kevin Nolan before him, the 33-year-old Webb refused to co-operate and has opted to walk away. \nAlthough Webb only won two of his 12 games games in charge, he was known to be popular in the dressing room and the move has left players upset. \nMOST READ IN FOOTBALL YOU WHAT?

Fred Nathan Leyton Orient faced a winding up order at the High Court earlier this month \nBut Becchetti, who lives in a £20m Mayfair mansion, is still getting involved in first-team affairs. \nRiza is now the ELEVENTH manager to take charge of the club in the 33 months since Becchetti bought the club. \nPrevious owner Barry Hearn had just six managers in 19 YEARS.
