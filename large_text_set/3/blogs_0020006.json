Apple replaces iPad Air 2 with more affordable 9.7-inch iPad, prices start at Rs 28,900 By - March 21, 2017 “The new 9.7-inch iPad comes with a brighter display and is powered by an Apple A9 chip” \nIn a sudden turn of events, the Apple has announced a cheaper variant of the 9.7-inch iPad, that is set to replace the current iPad Air 2 in the brand’s tablet lineup. The new product is simply called ‘iPad’, and will be available in silver, gold and space gray hues with 32GB of internal storage and iOS 10 out-of-the-box. \nDo note however, that the iPad Pro lineup will remain the top-of-the-line tablets from Apple. On the contrary, the new iPad features older internals like an 64-bit A9 chip, which is still an upgrade over the A8X chip found inside the iPad Air 2. The 9.7-inch Retina display of the iPad is said to have been made brighter, while features like TouchID, Picture-in-Picture, Slide Over and Split Screen are still on-board. That said, the device misses out on support for Apple Pencil, and neither does it come with a Smart Connector like the Pro lineup. \nAs per the pricing, the 32GB Wi-Fi model will be sold for Rs 28,900, while the 32GB Wi-Fi + Cellular model will set you back by Rs 39,900. The device will go on sale in India in April. Additionally, Apple has also increased the storage capacity of the iPad mini 4 to up to 128GB. The Wi-Fi only model will retail for Rs 34,900, while the Wi-Fi + Cellular edition will set you back by Rs 45,900.
