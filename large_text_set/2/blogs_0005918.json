In April 2016, true crime writer and Oswalt’s wife of more than a decade Michelle McNamara laid down to try and get a good night’s rest after working long and crazy hours on her latest project. Sadly, she didn’t wake up the next morning and EMT’s pronounced her dead at the scene at the young age of 46. \nAt the time, they had no official word on what caused her sudden death although the comedian speculated at the time that the love of his life had passed away in her sleep due to some Xanax she had taken before napping. McNamara left behind a young daughter, Alice, as well as her husband . \nNow, the results have come back on what caused her death and Oswalt’s initial guess wasn’t far off the eventual outcome. According to an exclusive statement Oswalt gave to the Associated Press , Michelle died due to a combination of Xanax, Adderall, and fentanyl (a pain reliever), as well as a previously unknown health condition that caused blockages in her arteries. Patton has written and spoken beautifully about his loss and his unexpected status as a single father, and while there may be no way to alleviate that grief any faster than it wants to go hopefully this new information offers some sense of closure after an unimaginably rough year. \n(via The AP )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:22:30.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
