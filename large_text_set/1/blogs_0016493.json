However, when he reluctantly gets a loud and enthusiastic sidekick — who has already picked out his own codename, Robin — the orphaned crime-fighter will begin to feel as though he has a family again. \nIn the irreverent spirit of fun that made The LEGO Movie a worldwide phenomenon, the self-described leading man of that ensemble – LEGO Batman – stars in his own big-screen adventure. But there are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if he wants to save the city from The Joker’s hostile takeover, Batman may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others and maybe, just maybe, learn to lighten up. \nWill Arnett reprises his starring role from The LEGO Movie as the voice of LEGO Batman, aka Bruce Wayne. Zach Galifianakis ( Hangover films) stars as The Joker; Michael Cera (TV’s Arrested Development ) as the orphan Dick Grayson; Rosario Dawson (TV’s Daredevil ) as Barbara Gordon; and Ralph Fiennes ( Harry Potter films) as Alfred. \nThe LEGO Batman Movie is directed by Chris McKay and produced by Dan Lin, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Roy Lee, who worked together on The LEGO Movie . It is written by Seth Grahame-Smith and Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers, with additional screenplay material by Jared Stern & John Whittington, based on LEGO Construction Toys. Jill Wilfert, Matthew Ashton and Will Allegra serve as executive producers. \nThe LEGO Batman Movie will open in theaters on February 10, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T11:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T11:00:32.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
