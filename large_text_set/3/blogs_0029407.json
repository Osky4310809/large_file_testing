In the pictures, she sported a shell bra top, pink lei, and a giant pink mermaid tail, of course. Roz hilariously noted in one of her captions, \"I'm a gotdamn mermaid.\"\nRelated:\nThis Mermaid Toast Is as Gorgeous as It Is Healthy\nWhile Roz loved her empowering photoshoot, she was unfortunately the target of some unwarranted comments. Faced with some particularly negative responses, Roz decided to share screenshots of some of the hateful comments in an attempt to hold those people accountable. One comment read , \"Don't go in the water. The fish is bad.\"\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BR6ezlUjXWY/", "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s750x750/sh0.08/e35/17333856_837977093007235_4852644940842270720_n.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRtRC8sDa6-/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRy9PXYj_Fr", "http://rozthediva.com/fancy-credentials", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BR6ckmlji8Q/", "https://www.facebook.com/coralscandidphotography"], "published": "2017-03-24T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:19:33.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
