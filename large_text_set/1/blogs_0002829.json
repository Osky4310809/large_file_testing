Then, they were forced to admit that it was only one isolated laptop infected with a virus. And finally, a Monday report in which the capital’s paper of record informed its readers the hack probably wasn’t linked at all to Russian operatives. \nNow, one writer from Forbes has traced back how The Washington Post got it so wrong. As it turns out, looking at digitally archived versions of the story as it broke proves that their blunders seem to go far beyond simple error and reveal just how shoddy the reporting was — including revealing the fact that the newspaper hadn’t even reached out to the utility to confirm the story before it was published. Advertisement - story continues below \nOn Monday, The Post published a mea culpa of sorts, detailing just how wrong they’d gotten it when it came to the “Russian hacking” of Burlington Electric in Bernie Sanders’ home state. \nAs federal officials investigate suspicious Internet activity found last week on a Vermont utility computer, they are finding evidence that the incident is not linked to any Russian government effort to target or hack the utility, according to experts and officials close to the investigation. \nAn employee at Burlington Electric Department was checking his Yahoo email account Friday and triggered an alert indicating that his computer had connected to a suspicious IP address associated by authorities with the Russian hacking operation that infiltrated the Democratic Party. Officials told the company that traffic with this particular address is found elsewhere in the country and is not unique to Burlington Electric, suggesting the company wasn’t being targeted by the Russians. \nThe computer, it turns out, was hacked with a software suite that intruders can use to put embed malware, but it has nothing to do with the “Grizzly Steppe” hacking program Russian intelligence allegedly runs. \nThe article said that once Burlington Electric released a statement clarifying that the computer was not connected to the grid, the newspaper admitted, they “immediately corrected its article and later added an editor’s note explaining the change.” \nHowever, an article by Kalev Leetaru in Forbes reveals that the truth is a bit more complicated than that. \nLeetaru had asked The Washington Post several questions about how their fact-finding had gone awry on the Burlington Electric story. “[I]t seemed odd that Burlington Electric issued a formal response refuting the Post’s claims just an hour and a half after the Post’s publication,” he wrote. “This would suggest that the Post would have gotten a response from Burlington if only it had just contacted the utility prior to publication, as is required by standard journalistic practice.” Advertisement - story continues below", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T02:49:17.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
