Peter Handscomb remains unbeaten on 83, while debutant Hilton Cartwright is batting on 25. Handscomb now has a 50-plus score in each of his four Tests. Renshaw, who struck his maiden ton on Tuesday, looked set to convert that into a double ton as he resumed Day Two in 167. He added just 17 more runs to his tally as he dragged one back on to his stumps off Imran Khan, giving him his first wicket of the innings. \nAfter Renshaw’s dismissal in the sixth over of the day, Handscomb and Cartwright have batted very well and have also added for 50 for the fifth wicket. Cartwright in fact got off the mark with a boundary off the very first ball he faced in international cricket. They have taken their time, yet Australia continue to score at close to four an over. Handscomb especially has taken a liking to Yasir Shah. He has slog swept Yasir with utmost ease and has collected a boundary on almost all occasions. Pakistan have managed to cut down the run flow, but have not been able to create pressure to pick up more than a wicket. \nFULL CRICKET SCORECARD: Australia vs Pakistan 3rd Test at Sydney \nAustralia had a chance to dismiss Cartwright right at the end of the session. Azhar Ali’s flighted ball took Cartwright’s outside edge. But Younis Khan failed to hang on to a low catch to his right, giving the youngster a lucky break. \nAustralia resumed Day Two of the Test at 365 for 4, after winning the toss on Day One and electing to bat first. David Warner initially stole the limelight with a magnificent 78-ball ton, which he scored before lunch. Warner thus became the fifth batsman after Victor Trumper, Charles Maccartney, Don Bradman and Majid Khan to score a century before the first session on the first day of a Test. His opening partner Renshaw took some time to get going, but reached his first ever Test ton in just his fourth Test. \nAustralia have already won the series and this match is nothing but a dead rubber. Australia won the first Test at Brisbane by 39 runs and followed that with an innings and 18-run win in the second Test at Melbourne. In this Test, other than Cartwright, Australia have also included Steve O’Keefe, who will partner Nathan Lyon in the spin department. As far as Pakistan are concerned, they have handed out a Test debut to Sharjeel Khan. Also, Imran Khan makes it back to the playing XI in place of Sohail Khan. \nBrief Scores : \nAustralia 454 for 4 (Matt Renshaw 184, David Warner 113; Imran Khan 1 for 97, Wahab Riaz 2 for 70) vs Pakistan .
