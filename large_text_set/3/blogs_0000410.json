You can’t tell her that. She has to find out for herself. You can give her clues and then eventually one thing will lead to another, she’ll come to her conclusion. But if you tell her right up front, you’ll lose a friend. So we’re not interested in losing any friends. Let them find out.” \nPelosi also did have some critical words for “white educated women who voted against Hillary,” on a day when she and many other female members of Congress are wearing white as a symbolic show of support for women’s rights: Tonight, our Democratic #WomenWearWhite in support of women’s rights — in spite of a @POTUS who doesn’t! pic.twitter.com/kKJpfV5iUE \n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 28, 2017 \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T05:16:40.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
