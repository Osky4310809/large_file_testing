Thornton China Center of the Brookings Institution, said that improving US relations with China and Russia is part of Trump's global strategy. \nLi Haidong, a professor of US studies at China Foreign Affairs University, said that Trump's clarification on the one-China policy likely is the result of evolving discussions within the Trump team on China policies and the end of the team's internal divergence. \nSince China is indispensable for resolving many global and regional issues, part of Trump's long-term diplomatic strategy may be to \"strike a balance between US treaty allies and China\", not sabotaging ties with either side, Li added. \nZhong Feiteng, an expert on Asia-Pacific affairs at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Trump's clarification might have been partly driven by the urgency to fulfill his campaign pledges on economic policies. \n\"Since China accounts for 30 to 40 percent of global growth, if he breaks up with China, it will be quite difficult for him to boost public satisfaction and employment,\" Zhong added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T13:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:08:55.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
