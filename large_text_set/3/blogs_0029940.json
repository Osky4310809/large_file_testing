Obsessed with wealth and himself, Stark gave little attention to the world around him until a terrorist cell ripped his world apart. Back in 2008, fans watched as the smarmy fellow pulled a turnaround after escaping the Ten Rings. Stark left behind his days as a weapons overlord to become an (albeit egocentric) superhero. However, when S pider-Man: Homecoming gets released this summer, fans will get a chance to see what might have happened if Stark went dark side. \nEarlier today, USA Today shed new light on the Spider-Man flick by giving fans a look into its villain, the Vulture. Played by Michael Keaton, the ground-up baddie has been seen a handful of times thus far in trailers, but there is plenty lying in wait behind the character’s psyche. According to co-producer Eirc Hauserman Carroll, Adrian Toomes is what happens when Tony Stark goes dark. \nIn the interview, Carroll said the Vulture has a case to pick against Tony Stark. Prior to becoming a villain, Toomes was a blue-collar worker who ran a company that would clean up disaster sites left behind after superheroes did battle. However, in the aftermath of Captain America: Civil War , Stark buys up the firm to Carroll’s dismay. Unhappy with the billionaire’s play, Toomes takes up the name Vulture as he and two other baddies begin scrapping alien tech to make deadly weapon for resale. And, if this all sounds familiar to you, then it’s because Tony could have gone that route long ago. Instead, the hero’s former mentor Obadiah Stane did. \nBack in Iron Man , Stark was shocked to learn his longtime friend Obadiah was going behind his back to profiteer off illegal weaponry sales. The elder man was displeased with Stark’s exorbitant use of wealth, and he even tried to kill the Stark to no avail. With the new Spider-Man film coming up, Stark will be faced with two people who’ve infiltrated the weapon’s trade to get back at him - and Iron Man will not take too kindly to it. \nFans seem to be intrigued by the Vulture and his inherent motives so far, and the Stark comparison only adds to the hype. Robert Downey Jr. will star in the upcoming movie, so audiences will see how Stark deals with the Vulture’s fallout firsthand. If the movie’s main baddie is primarily driven to do evil because of greed and a desire for revenge, then Stark is just the guy to help Peter Parker take them down. After all, the Avenger does have experience in the matter. \nA young Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland), who made his sensational debut in Captain America: Civil War, begins to navigate his newfound identity as the web-slinging super hero in Spider-Man: Homecoming . Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter returns home, where he lives with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.). Peter tries to fall back into his normal daily routine – distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man – but when the Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as a new villain, everything that Peter holds most important will be threatened. \nSpider-Man: Homecoming currently holds an impressive 4.06/5 in our user anticipation ratings!
