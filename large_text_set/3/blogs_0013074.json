He’s a true villain, isn’t he?). But there are a few mediums superheroes have not yet conquered, and here they are! Novels \n(source) \nMichael Chabon’s \"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay\" won a Pulitzer for its portrayal of two creators of a Superman-style hero. However, a novel about a straight-up superhero never really hit in the same way. Maybe it's hard to write prose versions of superpowered fist-fights? Fine Art \n(source) \nAlthough Roy Lichstein has done blow-ups of comic book panels in the past, superheroes have mostly stayed out of the fine art world, even as overbearing metaphor. Unless you count the ancient gods as superheroes, of course. And until the ancient gods have magnet powers, I dunno you guys! Theater \nThe Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark had some serious pedigree behind it — in particular, the director of the Lion King stage adaptation, Julie Taymor. Unfortunately, a terrible soundtrack and a slew of actors literally breaking their bones kept it from becoming the masterpiece it wanted to be. Fine food \nSure, there’ve been birthday cakes, but we have yet to eat gourmet food in the shape of Batman. And that is a crime. Everyday wear \n(source) \nWhy is my Sinestro costume not acceptable day to day wear?! This is an insult. I hate everything. Ugh. \nSomeday, superheroes will be in everything we love, and we will barf and be sick of them. Until then, tell me why I’m wrong at @AlexFirer .
