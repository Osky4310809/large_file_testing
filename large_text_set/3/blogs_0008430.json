Fondly called Magnificent Mary, the 34 -year-old boxer, hailing from Manipur, is only female boxer to have won a medal in each of the six world championships.

Ranked as No. 4 in AIBA World Women's Ranking Flyweight category, she went on to become the first Indian female boxer to get a gold medal in the 2014 Asian Games held in Incheon, South Korea. From being a small town girl, born to a farmers' family in Manipur, to becoming an award-winning (including the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shree) sportswoman, Mary's journey is nothing less than magnificent.
