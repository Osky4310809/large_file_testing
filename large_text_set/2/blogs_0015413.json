To be an actor and be able to have a positive impact on someone else’s life is the biggest reward, I think, that any actor could ever ask for, and to have you guys’ support is the cherry on top. \n“So thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you dearly and I hope to see you all again in the future.” \nAfter arriving in Albert Square as the son of Mick and Linda, former squaddie Lee decided to pack his bags to start a new life in Dover on Friday's episode of the soap. \nHis departure left wife Whitney in floods of tears. \nBefore jumping into a black cab, his dad Mick called out to him for one last heart-to-heart to say goodbye.
