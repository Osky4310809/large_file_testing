The character had about as much screen time in the original film as he did in a trailer for the sequel. \nLuckily for fans hoping to see more of the tiny house plant, Baby Groot will be a major part of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and it's not just a move made to sell adorable merchandise. Speaking to press on the set of Vol. 2 , Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige revealed the reasoning for Groot staying little throughout the sequel rather than growing into the fully formed tree we met in the original. \n\"I don’t know if you’re aware, but the growth cycle of a Groot is slower,\" Feige said. \"This movie takes place relatively soon after the events of the last film.\" \nBy \"relatively soon,\" Feige means \"a couple months\" after the the 2014 film which saw the Guardians, Baby Groot in tow, heading off of Xandar to an unknown destination. \n\"He’s probably just grown out of that pot and stepped out, and is now this size, but as James [Gunn] I’m sure will tell you, he’s just as dumb as big Groot was, and I mean, he’s not really a baby,\" Feige said. \"As James said in that sizzle, he gets, he gets mad at people. And then of course, the fun thing is, as you saw briefly in there, whereas Groot was Rocket’s protector in the first movie, Rocket is Groot’s protector, and they sort of all are in this movie, which was something we had talked about and planned on. It was one of those things, when we were making the first film, and we were just concentrating on making that film as great as it can be, there are always little things that we say, boy, if we get to make another one, it would be really fun. And from the moment we were shooting and animating Rocket on Groot shoulder, we were saying, on the next one, we’ll reverse it. Wouldn’t that be cool? And that’s what we’re doing.\" \nLet's just hope Groot is smart enought to not set that bomb off that we saw in the trailer! \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hits theaters May 5, 2017.
