The company’s INSTO 5-Step Process Technology Operator Training for professionals has been used by downstream oil firms all over the world to improve significantly plant efficiencies. \nSpeaking at the event, held in Lagos, U.S. Consul General, John Bray, said that for Nigeria to overcome its current economic challenges, it must find ways to diversify its economy while improving firm-level productivity. \nHe urged participants to actively engage with Simulation Solutions to improve their organizations’ bottom-line profitability. President of Simulation Solutions, Inc, Don Glaser and Project Engineer, Matthew Garvey, showcased the Simulation Solution’s patented training programs, which combine collaborative classroom techniques with innovative simulator exercises to achieve a “Hands-On/Minds-On” work ethic among students. \n“U.S. Commercial Service in Nigeria will continue its support for Simulation Solutions and its Nigeria partners as they roll out training programs at interested organizations across the country. \n“The Foreign Commercial Service of the U.S. government works to promote the expansion of U.S. trade and investment to Nigeria through support of business partnerships between American and Nigerian companies”, he said.
