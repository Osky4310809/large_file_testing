News Group Newspapers Ltd 6 Ruben Bover played alongside some of football’s greats \nHis time amid the glitz and glamour of The City That Never Sleeps came after he started his career in non-league at Kidderminster Harriers. \nHe went on to play in front of 20,000 fans in the MLS with former Everton star Tim Cahill, free-kick maestro Juninho Pernambucano and Arsenal legend Henry at New York Red Bulls. \nBover says: “Thierry is the best I’ve ever played with – he is top level, a different class. All he has done is because he worked hard for it. \n“Playing next to him, I learned something every day. It’s a thing I can take into my game now and move forward. He is one of the best strikers in the history of this game. New York Red Bulls and New York City fans clash before the Major \n“I learnt from him that if you want something you have to work hard, improve every day and do extra work in training - and then maybe one day you will achieve all that he has.” \nAnd the former France striker, famous for his va-va-voom, taught Bover that passion and enjoyment were just as important as hard work and talent on the road to greatness. \nBover, 24, says: “He showed you have to have love and passion for the game. He was a great character in the dressing room, too. Thierry is serious sometimes because he has to be, but he’s also really funny.

Raul is another legend – especially for me as a Spanish guy watching him play for the national team. Being able to play next to him every day was amazing. \n“I also shared a room with Marcos Senna, another Spanish legend who won the Euros. He had the biggest impact on my game as a midfielder. Last season I played every game because I learned so much from him.

Their personality says everything about them. You see them as superstars but they are normal people. Winning the league with them was amazing.” \nDespite his triumphs in America, Bover found himself without a club in early December and had an extended holiday back home in Mallorca before Barnet came knocking at the end of January. \nHe is the latest of seven new faces at the recently refurbished Hive and says his new club matches his ambitions – despite perhaps lacking some of the New York glamour.

People from all over the world would come and you played in some great atmospheres. It was a very good feeling. \n“For me New York is the best city in the world. You can do anything you want – you can do something different every day. But I wanted to improve as a player and grow and the best leagues are in England – that’s why I came here and I’m very excited to be with Barnet. \n“I was back home in Mallorca for a month and a half. It’s a long time for holidays, but this opportunity came and I didn’t think twice about it. I trained with them and liked it and they liked me so I’m moving forward. \n“In training you can see already people settling in. I am the latest one but you can see everyone is gelling. It’s an amazing atmosphere down here and that’s going to help the team achieve our goal to go up to League One. This club deserve to be higher.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:34:18.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
