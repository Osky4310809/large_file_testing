I am focused on our game on Sunday. \n\"I'm not here to talk about what happened in midweek.\" \nMadrid enjoyed their own impressive Champions League outing 24 hours before Barcelona, coming from behind at a hostile Stadio San Paolo to repeat their first-leg scoreline of a 3-1 victory over Serie A high-flyers Napoli. \nZidane maintains fighting to defend their European crown will not distract Madrid from their quest to win LaLiga for the first time since 2011-12. \nProof Barca get the most penalties \n\"We have not won the league for quite a few years, maybe five or six years,\" he added. \n\"We are really motivated, we want to win this league title. It's difficult to play every three days with the same intensity and energy. \n\"Rivals also play their part and can make life hard for you. The league is important and we want to win this league title this season \n\"My players are up for the title race.\" \nBarcelona host Valencia at Camp Nou on Sunday.
