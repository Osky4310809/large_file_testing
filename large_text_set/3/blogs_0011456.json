Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nCeltic and Rangers will meet in the fourth Old Firm derby of the season on Sunday. \nWith the Scottish title virtually wrapped up by Brendan Rodgers' side, bragging rights are all that are at stake at Parkhead. \nCeltic are 24 points clear at the top of the table and 33 ahead of their Glasgow rivals. \nThey've won all three Old Firm derbies so far this season, but Rangers will be hoping to salvage a bit of pride in what has been a disappointing season. \nCan they pull off a shock win to impress new manager Pedro Caixinha who will be watching from the stands? \nHere, reporters from our sister paper the Daily Record make their predictions for the match: Read More New Rangers boss Pedro Caixinha will watch proceedings from the stands at Celtic Park (Photo: Anadolu Agency/Getty) Keith Jackson \nCeltic 3 Rangers 0 \nCeltic are red-hot favourites for a reason. Better players all over the pitch and a better boss in the dugout. \nIf Moussa Dembele and Scott Sinclair hit top form it will only be a matter of how many. David McCarthy \nCeltic 3 Rangers 1 \nBrendan Rodgers’ team have too much quality and firepower to be denied by a Rangers outfit which doesn’t travel well. Celtic's Moussa Dembele will be the star player on show in the Old Firm derby (Photo: Ian MacNicol) \nThe visitors will surely have too much pride to submit to the kind of hammering they suffered in September, but they won't come away celebrating an unlikely victory. Craig Swan \nCeltic 1 Rangers 0 \nCeltic should win on form. But the last two meetings have been tight and Rangers will dig in again and make it tough for the champions. Gary Ralston \nCeltic 3 Rangers 1 \nRangers may have improved in recent weeks, but Celtic show no signs of letting up in their drive for the Treble.

Michael Gannon \nCeltic 4 Rangers 2 \nForget this gibberish about record scores. Rangers will get chances and that could make it interesting but an early Celtic goal and it’ll be damage limitation for Gers. Scott McDermott \nCeltic 2 Rangers 0 \nGraeme Murty will have Rangers organised defensively to ensure it’s not another Parkhead rout. Dembele and Sinclair are likely to be match winners.

Gordon Waddell \nCeltic 2 Rangers 0 \nIn their first post-Mark Warburton derby, Rangers have to understand they can’t go toe to toe with Celtic without suffering the same consequences as before. They’ll only limit the damage.

However, it may be closer than many have predicted. Anthony Haggerty \nCeltic 4 Rangers 0 \nNew Rangers boss Pedro Caixinha will be watching from the Parkhead stands but it might be a case of red rag to a bull for the Portuguese coach. Celtic have an abundance of match winners. Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T10:52:16.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
