Santalab makes WSW history 0:54 \nBut after halftime he produced a wonderful purple patch. \nFirst he latched onto a delightful ball from Scott Neville, finding space among four defenders to head home.But if the second goal was a classic striker’s finish, Santalab’s third was an exceptional one. \nWith City goalkeeper Sorensen rushing forward, Santalab put his body on the line and headed home goal number 14 of 2016/17, sealing his first hat-trick for the Wanderers. \n“What a brave header,” Robbie Slater said on Fox Sports. \n“When you look at it, big Sorensen coming at you, not every striker would have gone for it.” \nIt was a genuinely delightful striker’s performance and one that has surely cemented his spot as the man leading the line week in, week out. \nMATCH REPORT: SANTALAB HITS HAT-TRICK AS WANDERERS SINK CITY \n“Popa’s got no choice but to start him,” Sasa Ognenovski said on Fox Sports post-match. \n“He’s the heartbeat of this team, you can see when he scores a goal, his teammates rush to him.” \nWhen he exited the game, in the 85th minute, Santalab — ever a fan favourite at Wanderland — earned a standing ovation from the Western Sydney faithful. \nAppropriately, it was for Lachlan Scott, the lanky youngster who looms as Santalab’s heir apparent. \nBut if those five goals in two weeks are to be believed, the changing of the guard is a fair way off yet. \nThat said — Scott could get his chance next week, with Santalab suspended for the trip to Newcastle after picking up a yellow card. \nNOT ‘PANIC STATIONS’ FOR INCONSISTENT CITY \nTo say the result was disappointing for Melbourne City is an understatement. \nSecond place — already an unrealistic aim — looks all but gone, while their hold on third place has become tentative. \nThe two second-half goals earned the ire of coach Michael Valkanis, while Bruno Fornaroli missed a gilt-edged chance to cut the deficit back to a goal when he had a poor penalty saved by Vedran Janjetovic. \nBut Rudan said City needed to be measured with its response. \n“It’s not panic stations for them,” he said. \n“They started the game off quite well ... their games against the Wanderers are always quite tough, they're always quite tight. \n“From a whole, I don't think they’re too far away. They certainly weren’t at the races today, their head wasn’t in the game and they’ve got to improve.” \nBut Ognenovski was critical of a City side that had delivered a “scintillating” performance against the Jets the week before. \n“The most concerning thing for me is ... we didn’t see that same energy tonight,” he said. \n“The Melbourne City fans, the Melbourne City club needs to see that energy, week-in, week-out. \n“How can you support Melbourne City when you don’t know what you’re going to get? \n“There’s something missing, there’s something amiss in that club.” \nWANDERERS YOUNGSTER HAD TO BE BETTER: RUDAN \nWhen Neil Kilkenny lashed home the game’s opening goal, it came off the back of a poor defensive passage of play all-round from the Wanderers. \nFirst, Nick Fitzgerald cut his way through the Wanderers defence. Kilkenny silences WSW 0:46 \nBut the worst was yet to come. \nWhen Neil Kilkenny unleashed an ambitious long-range strike, it cannoned off the shoulder of Jonathan Aspropotamitis and past Vedran Janjetovic. \nCrucially, the young Wanderers centre-back turned his back, a decision that caught the eye of Rudan. \nThe former Sydney FC defender said the youngster had broken a golden rule: “don’t turn your back (on the ball)”. \n“Aspro needs to just face the ball,” Rudan said. \n“Take one in the head if you need to.” \nNICHOLS’ NIGHT OF NEARLYS \nTry as he might, it felt like a goal just wasn’t coming for Mitch Nichols. \nHe really should have scored when he was one-on-one with Sorensen early in the game, yet took a heavy touch into the City goalkeeper. WSW v MCY: Match Highlights 3:54 \nThen, he unleashed an ambitious volley that just skied over the bar — a sublime piece of skill that didn’t quite pay off. \nEarly in the second half, he went on another run, but again couldn’t find the back of the net. \nIn the 56th minute, with Bruce Kamau for company, Nichols again charged forward. \nThis time, his shot was tame — straight into the arms of Sorensen. \nThe midfielder saw the lighter side of his misfortune post-match. \n“Santa keeps putting them away ... hopefully I can get one soon,” he told Fox Sports.
