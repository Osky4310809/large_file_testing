(AP) — Defensive standout Kevin Kiermaier and the Tampa Bay Rays have finalized a six-year, $53.6 million contract extension that keeps the centerfielder with the team through 2022. \nThe deal announced Monday includes a club option for 2023 which — including incentives — could boost the value of the agreement to $66.15 million. \nThe two-time AL Gold Glove winner avoided salary arbitration in January when he agreed to a one-year contract that would pay him $2.975 million for the upcoming season. \nThe 26-year-old made $514,400 last season while batting .246 with 12 homers, 37 RBIs and career-best 21 stolen bases in 105 games. \nKiermaier missed 48 games with a broken left hand last year, including a stretch when the Rays lost 22 of 25 games to tumble to last place in the AL East. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:55:52.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
