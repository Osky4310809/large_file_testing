(he was honestly super happy that Moonlight had won because he thought it was fantastic). And today, we found out exactly why Gosling was laughing during the Oscars mix-up .\nAnd tbh, it makes a lot of sense. In case you missed it, we’re referring to the fact that while everyone else on stage during that anxiety-inducing moment ran the gamut from confused to downright shocked, Gosling just looked like he was trying not to giggle .\nRYAN GOSLING IS LAUGHING AT THE FACT LA LA LAND ACTUALLY LOST BEST PICTURE THIS IS WHY I LOVE RYAN GOSLING pic.twitter.com/LniXdflpnR \n— gosling (@allthelovhazza) March 3, 2017 And here’s why. “What really was happening as I was watching, it was surreal anyway, I was watching people start to have this panicked reaction in the crowd and guys were coming on with headsets and I felt like someone had been hurt,” he said at an Adobe event on March 22nd. “I thought there was some kind of medical situation, and I had this worst-case scenario playing out in my head. And then I just heard Moonlight won and I was so relieved that I started laughing.” via GIPHY \nWe get it, Ryan. We truly do (and way to keep everything in perspective). And tbh we wouldn’t have wanted your reaction to be any other way, because you trying to keep it together in that insane moment GIVES US LIFE.\nAt the end of the day, we’re just super glad that Moonlight received the accolades it deserves (if you haven’t seen it, drop everything you’re doing and do so now! It’s a subtle, beautiful film that will stick with you for days).\nAnd, as always, we’re super glad that Ryan continues to keep it chill AF. Forever and always.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:24:52.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
