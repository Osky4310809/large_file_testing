Some of Donald Trump’s most controversial campaign proposals will move one step closer to reality Wednesday when the president is expected to sign a series of sweeping executive actions on immigration and border security, reportedly fulfilling promises to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, curtail the number of refugees entering the country, ban immigration from several majority-Muslim countries, and crack down on so-called “sanctuary cities.” \nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/824083821889015809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw The executive actions are among several planned changes to the U.S. national security policy, The New York Times reports , including potentially designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization and reviewing whether to resume the use of C.I.A. “black site” detention centers. While one draft reviewed by the Times says that “no person in the custody of the United States shall at any time be subjected to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as describe by U.S. or international law,” the draft of another would order a reevaluation of so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques,” which could include water boarding. With his executive action on border security, Trump is expected to direct the use of federal funds to begin construction of a wall under the expanded authority of a pre-existing 2006 law giving the Department of Homeland Security discretion over what kind of barrier to build. (The cost of construction, Trump has said, will be paid by U.S. taxpayers until he can figure out how to “have Mexico pay,” as he promised repeatedly on the campaign trail. President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico has insisted his government will not reimburse Trump.) Democrats have said expenditures on the wall could top $14 billion. Trump is also reportedly considering a temporary ban on visas to individuals trying to enter the country from a number of majority-Muslim Middle Eastern countries—Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The proposed policy would not go as far as Trump’s campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States, although it would have a similar effect. Trump will also review the U.S. refugee program, The Washington Post reports , and could issue a four-month freeze on the program while his administration determines a long-term plan. “From a legal standpoint, it would be exactly within his legal rights,” Stephen Legomsky , who was chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under President Obama, told Reuters. “But from a policy standpoint, it would be terrible idea because there is such an urgent humanitarian need right now for refugees.” The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump will likely limit the number of refugees allowed to resettle in the U.S. during the fiscal year at 50,000, less than half of the 110,000 cap set under President Obama, according to an official close to the discussions. Immigration advocates are outraged by the expected shift in policy, which Trump could order as soon as Wednesday. “To think that Trump’s first 100 days are going to be marked by this very shameful shutting of our doors to everybody who is seeking refuge in this country is very concerning,” Marielena Hincapié , the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, told the Times . “Everything points to this being simply a backdoor Muslim ban.” Trump’s promised crackdown on immigrants would not end at the nation’s borders, either. The president is also expected to sign an executive order that would punish so-called “sanctuary cities”—such as New York City, Boston, and San Francisco—that protect undocumented immigrants, the Post reports . It is unclear if the string of executive orders expected on Wednesday will impact the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children. One official told the Post that “many options are being worked through on DACA.” In a press conference on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested that the program might be off the table for the time being, as the administration focuses on deporting “criminals,” effectively continuing the prioritization regime established under Obama. While Trump has signaled that he does not intend to follow through on his campaign promise of mass deportations, there are signs his administration may yet expand the scope of his national security agenda to include other kinds of enhanced federal law enforcement actions. “If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!” Trump wrote on Twitter Tuesday night, threatening the imposition of martial law. The tweet followed a Chicago Tribune crime report released on Monday, detailing the upsurge in homicides in the Midwestern city. Trump’s tweet came minutes after Fox News host __Bill O’Reilly reviewed the statistics on his show, The O’Reilly Factor , suggesting that Trump was watching the program. The president’s online outburst might also suggest a threat aimed at Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, who Politico notes recently lambasted the newly-elected president for fixating on the number of supporters who came out to watch his swearing-in ceremony over the weekend. “You didn’t get elected to debate the crowd size at your inaugural,” Emanuel cracked. “You got elected to make sure that people have a job, that the economy continues to grow, people have security as it relates to their kids’ education. It wasn’t about your crowd size. It was about their lives and their jobs.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T05:33:21.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
