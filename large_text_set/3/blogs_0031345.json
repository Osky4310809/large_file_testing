There’s been a number of companies trying to adopt it to a desktop platform as well lately, and we’ve talked about Remix OS from Jide quite extensively in the past. They aren’t the only people working on this idea though, and we’ve touched on Phoenix OS a couple of times before as well.\nAs it is right now, you can download Phoenix OS in two different flavors. The first is designed to bring Android to the desktop platform and it can be installed on x86 hardware. There’s also a tablet version though, and this currently supports the Nexus 9 , Nexus 7 ( Grouper and Flo ), and the Nexus 10 . They even have a version that is specifically made to work on the Firefly RK3288 development board. Their current stable version is 1.2.3-277, which is based on Android 5.1 Lollipop, but now they’re testing an alpha build of version 2.0.\nVersion 2.0 of Phoenix OS is based on Android 7.1 Nougat and that is a big step up from what people have been using. The new update was officially announced late last week, and like the other builds it is available in either an EXE or ISO format for you to download. The team has been working on more than just updating the sources to Android 7.1 Nougat too — one of the bigger additions is brand new support for 8188EU and 8723B network adapters.\nThe new 2.0 alpha build also brings support for virtual machines, and they fixed a bug that was causing people to not be able to enter Phoenix OS due to a conflict with the Linux kernel. The new version comes with updated pre-installed applications, some new wallpapers, and a user guide has been added to the start menu. Remember though, this is an alpha build so there could be rough around the edges. So just be sure to have a backup plan in case something doesn’t work the way it was intended.\nSource: Phoenix Studio ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:56:12.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
