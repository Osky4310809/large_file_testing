[Photo/Agencies] \nThousands of demonstrators turned out Monday across the US to challenge Donald Trump in a Presidents' Day protest dubbed Not My President's Day. \nThe numbers weren't close to the million-plus who thronged the streets following Trump's inauguration a month earlier, but the message was similar. \nThousands of flag-waving protesters lined up outside Central Park in Manhattan. Many in the crowd chanted \"No ban, no wall. The Trump regime has got to fall.\" They held aloft signs saying \"Uphold the Constitution Now\" and \"Impeach the Liar.\" \nIn Chicago, several hundred rallied across the river from the Trump Tower, shouting \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go.\" Rebecca Wolfram of Chicago, who's in her 60s, said concerns about climate change and immigrant rights under Trump prompted her to start attending rallies. \n\"I'm trying to demonstrate as much as possible until I figure out what else to do,\" said Wolfram, who held a sign that said \"Old white ladies are really displeased.\" Several hundred demonstrated in Washington, D.C. \nDozens gathered around the fountain in Dupont Circle chanting \"Dump Trump\" and \"Love, not hate: That's what makes America great.\" \nDozens marched through midtown Atlanta for a rally named with a Georgia flavor: \"ImPEACH NOW! (Not My) President's Day March.\" Hundreds of protesters chanting \"This is what democracy looks like\" marched through Salt Lake City. \nThe Salt Lake Tribune reports that the crowd marched to push back against Trump and his administration's stance on such issues as the environment, immigration, free speech and Russia. \nSome people raised signs that said \"Not My President,\" while others held up a large American flag. \nProtester Reg Brookings warned the crowd that Trump is trying to divide the country by making such groups as immigrants the enemy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:08:30.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
