Princess Charlotte was also in attendance, which officially made this intimate London get together our ultimate fantasy brunch trio. Better yet, Meghan Markle gave Kate Middleton something very special and we just NEED to know more.\nI mean, can you imagine sipping mimosas and munching on scones with these three? #squadgoals for life. According to People , the meeting went down last Tuesday at Kensington Palace. While Harry introduced Markle to his brother, Prince William, two months ago, this was Meghan’s first time hanging out with Princess Kate. The introduction came right on the heels of Kate’s 35th birthday, and The Sun reports that Markle brought along a special gift for the Duchess to mark the occasion.\nRay Tamarra/Getty Images Here’s where things get really interesting. Because what on earth do you give Kate Middleton for her birthday? Let’s face it. She lives in a palace. She’s married to Prince Charming. She’s got two adorable kids and totally rocks at carrying out her royal philanthropy duties. She’s never had a bad hair day. And oh yeah, one day she’ll be the Queen of England. So basically, Meghan had her work cut out for her.\nBut anyone who’s taken even a cursory glance at Markle’s lifestyle website The Tig knows that she has impeccable taste. Meghan is all about finding inspiration in the beauty of life around her, whether from books, travel or fine food. Her gift for Princess Kate fits right in with her positive vibe. According to The Sun , Meghan gave Kate a leather-bound dream journal.\nWe can totally see Meghan Markle being into something like a dream journal. We’re guessing hers is full of inspirational quotes like the ones on her Instagram and possibly pics of Prince Harry cuddling with her dogs. She might even record her actual dreams in a journal, especially since she sleeps in a gorgeous bed she calls “the bird cage.”\nNight night #bedtime #birdcage \nA photo posted by Meghan Markle (@meghanmarkle) on Jun 10, 2016 at 7:03pm PDT \nWhat is a dream journal exactly?
