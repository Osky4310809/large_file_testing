The mouth-watering menu is straight forward, with a selection of sandwiches, paninis, salads and pizzas that go beyond the typical fast-casual route. Management is still finalizing the printed menu for the counter-service spot, so visitors will use a chalkboard menu this week, said co-owner Georg Simos. Simos shared a preliminary version that gives eaters a good idea of Vidalia’s offerings. They’re going for a deli feel with quality meats and cheeses. Haywood Tavern chef Rodney Staton created the food. Smoked meats power many of the sandwiches. Case in point it the “High Street Pork,” originally described as Vidalia’s answer to the Philly cheesesteak. The smoked pork shoulder comes with provolone, sautéed and spicy broccolini, and grain mustard aioli on ciabatta. Then there’s a Montreal-style smoked brisket sandwich, plus a smoked salmon with goat and cream cheese spread, cucumber, tomato-caper relish on pumpernickel. A smoked chicken salad sandwich rounds out the bunch. Georg Simos There are eight cold sandwiches on the menu as well as eight paninis. It’s not all meat-heavy, as veggie options include the mushroom and Taleggio panini, as well as a red pepper and goat cheese. A Nutella, banana and mascarpone provides a sweet respite. Vidalia’s pizza differs from Dante’s New York-style pies. They describe it as their take on Chicago thin crust with four signature pies: The sausage, pepper and garlic; a bacon, leek and ricotta pizza; a pepperoni, soppressata and nduja pie; and an artichoke, roasted tomato, arugula pie with garlic sauce. Folks can also pick their own toppings. Eventually they’ll add delivery, but for now, Simos and his colleagues are ready to peel the curtain off Vidalia at 11 a.m. on Wednesday. Vidalia, 1964 W. Lawrence Ave., (773) 293-7608 , open 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:40:26.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
