If the election were held today, voters would deliver a 1.5% swing towards Labor, giving Mark McGowan’s opposition a 14-seat majority. \nOne Nation’s primary vote in WA has increased from 3% to 13%, that could result in the party holding the balance of power in the state’s upper house. Joyce tells WA Liberals a One Nation preference deal risks feud with Nationals Read more \nThe Liberal party’s primary vote has decreased to just 30%, but Labor also saw a slump in its primary support from 41% to 38%. \nThe strong polling for One Nation is likely to increase pressure on the premier, Colin Barnett, to enter into a preference deal with the minority party, but such an arrangement could spark political divisions between the Liberals and Nationals. However, One Nation’s leader in WA, Colin Tincknell, ruled out entering into preference deals with any of the major parties. \nThe National’s campaign launch is scheduled for the south-west town of Bunbury on Friday, with leader Brendon Grylls likely to be quizzed over his contentious plan to increase an iron ore charge paid by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto by twentyfold. The plan has angered the mining companies and the Chamber of Minerals and Energy. \nBut Grylls, who won the support of country voters with his Royalties for Regions program in 2008, says the charge hasn’t increased since it was introduced in the 1960s.He argues his hike will raise $7.2bn for government coffers, which is sorely needed because the state isn’t getting its fair share of GST revenue.While Barnett has refused to commit to adopting the policy if the Liberal-National alliance is returned for a third term, he stood up for Grylls on Thursday, saying he wasn’t happy with the industry’s campaign against the Pilbara MP.
