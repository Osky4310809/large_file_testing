The story has been written by KV Vijayendra Prasad of Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Baahubali fame. \nAccording to a report in Mid-Day , Kangana and Ketan Mehta have fallen out. \nThe report stated that Mehta wanted to shoot his film in English as he wanted the biopic to have a global appeal. But Kangana, who also worked on the script, had a different opinion. A source was quoted as telling the daily, \"Ketan was insistent that his movie be made in English for an international audience, like Gurinder Chadha's The Viceroy House , but those working on the film felt it won't go with the ethos of the story. The actress and the filmmaker couldn't find common ground on the language factor, leaving the project in a limbo.\" \nKangana will next be seen in Hansal Mehta's Simran . The film is scheduled to release on 15 September. \n  07:23   07:23 pm Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:13:40.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
