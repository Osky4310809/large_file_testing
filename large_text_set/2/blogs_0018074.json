Cabin-like interior. French doors. Is literally a boat. Where else can you find a loft and a rooftop deck in Seattle for less than $200,000 ? The home, dubbed “Emma,” has more of a traditional boat design than many floating homes, so you get that full skipper lifestyle in a little, 406 square foot package. It’s described as a bit of a “fixer,” but with a little work the right person can build the floating home of their dreams. Special Agents Realty Special Agents Realty Special Agents Realty The living area is full of windows, bringing out the warm tones in the wooden walls. A wood stove keeps the boat cozy. The small kitchen takes care of the basics—a sink, a stove, a fridge—and not much else. The bedroom window crawls right out onto the roof deck for easy access to crisp, morning air. Slip rent at the current site in Wallingford near Gas Works Park is $920 a month, with room for another, smaller, boat. But that’s the great thing about boats: If you’re not attached to the location, you can eventually float on down to somewhere else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:52:17.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
