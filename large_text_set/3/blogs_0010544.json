House Speaker Paul Ryan (Photo: Michael Reynolds, epa) 45 CONNECT 11 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Congressional Budget Office, the gold standard in trying to divine the impact of legislation, was not kind to the Republican alternative to Obamacare. The measure that passed in committee last week would reduce the number of insured people by 14 million next year and 24 million by 2026, the CBO said Monday . \nAt the same time, the non-partisan agency said, in the next two years premiums in the individual market would jump by 15% to 20% more than they would under current law, undercutting the Republicans' argument that their legislation is needed to rein in rising premiums and that people wouldn't be hurt by their plan. \nThe House GOP measure would greatly curtail the financial incentives for individuals to buy insurance on state exchanges while all but eliminating the penalties for not doing so. It would also scale back on Medicaid, the principal form of insurance for those on the bottom rungs of the income ladder. \nThe result would be bleak, if not horrific. One out of every 14 Americans who now has insurance would lose it over the next decade. The government's red ink would be reduced by $337 billion in the same period, but that would come largely by cutting assistance to poorer people while offering a whopping tax cut for families making more than $250,000 a year. \nGiven the CBO \"scoring\" of their bill, House Republicans ought to start over on their plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Better yet, they should look for ways to retain and repair the current law. Instead, their initial reaction was to to blame the messenger by bad-mouthing the CBO. Paul Ryan: Our plan offers more choices \nRep. David Brat, R-Va., for example, claimed that “the CBO has scored everything wrong, forever.” Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said \"we disagree strenuously\" and the CBO estimate is \"just not believable.\" \nEstimating the impact over time of any legislation is a Herculean task that does not always lend itself to perfect accuracy. But the CBO has long had a better track record than the Office of Management and Budget, which is under the control of the White House. \nRepublicans have traditionally been more supportive of the CBO, using it to counter more rosy estimates made by the Clinton and Obama administrations. What's more, when Republicans took control of both chamber of Congress in 2015, they dumped the longtime and well-respected director of the CBO, Douglas Elmendorf, and replaced him with Keith Hall , a proponent of \"dynamic\" scoring methods that generally see GOP proposals in a more favorable light. \nAttacking the CBO now will only strengthen the argument that President Trump and his backers on Capitol Hill live in a world of alternative facts and relative truths. A superior approach would be to come up with a way to actually improve the nation’s health care system. \nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board , separate from the news staff.
