(Mizzou Athletics photo) Mizzou submits stadium architect approval Thursday By Dave Matter St. Louis Post-Dispatch 2 hrs ago \nMissouri's proposed rendering of the new south end zone structure at Memorial Stadium. (Mizzou Athletics photo) TownNews.com Content Exchange \nCOLUMBIA, MO. • At Thursday’s meeting of the University of Missouri Board of Curators, Mizzou athletics will propose funding for an architect to design the south end zone facility for Memorial Stadium. The total project budget has been set at $96.7 million, while $4.31 million has been committed to cover the design costs through private gifts, according to the meeting agenda released Monday by the board. \nThe proposed project is a four-story football team facility affixed to a newly constructed south side of the stadium that will feature new areas for private suites and general admission seating. Rather than build around the current south end zone structure, Missouri has decided to take down the entire south bowl and build a new structure, athletics director Jim Sterk announced in December. Mizzou also released artist renderings of the project in December. \nThough the curators are only voting Thursday to approve the architect, the measure is expected to generate more dialogue than typical for an athletics funding project, especially in the wake of Gov. Eric Greitens’ plans to cut state funding for the UM system. One university source expected the measure to eventually pass but not without thorough discussion. \nMU is proposing approval for the hiring of Populous, Inc., a Kansas City architectural firm, to design the facility. Poulous has handled similar football facilities at Colorado, Kansas State and Oklahoma. \nHere’s more from the Curators' agenda: \n“Nearly all Intercollegiate Athletic (ICA) programs utilize the same training, study, and dining facilities located in the Mizzou Athletic Training Complex (MATC). The heavy use of the MATC by all sports presents scheduling challenges and limited availability of resources to student athletes and team training programs. Many Division I teams have invested in excellent football focused team facilities, including many Southeastern Conference (SEC) institutions. Top recruits factor access to this type of focused facilities in their decision as to which university to attend. Construction of a football focused facility will enhance recruiting specifically for football but also of student athletes across all sports and academic interests since it will alleviate congestion at the MATC. Memorial Stadium is the heart of the football program for fans and the team. Facility improvements have been made over the last 20 years to many areas of the stadium and field. The south end bowl of 10,800 general admission seats was constructed in 1977. It has not been measurably updated to improve the fan experience and is showing signs of deterioration and settlement consistent with a structure of this age. A change in seating mix to include premium seating and premium amenities and new general admission seating is projected to provide an increase in revenue \n“MU’s ICA Master Planner and planning team recently completed a study to address the issues of creating a football focused team facility and eliminating an aging component of Memorial Stadium with the goal to improve the fan experience and revenues. The proposed project will build a new four-story building and seating at the south end of Memorial Stadium. The football team facility component of the project is approximately 107,000 gross square feet (GSF). Spaces include a new team locker room (both training and game day use), football training facility, weight room, coaching offices and team meeting rooms, public and recruiting reception areas, equipment storage, and broadcast space. New kitchen and dining space is planned to serve both premium seating venues and team dining functions. The facility related to seating for fans includes approximately 38,500 GSF of enclosed premium club space, twenty-four (24) suites with twelve (12) seats each, and associated support spaces. Public amenities for general admission seats include new concessions and restrooms. The seating area is planned for 5,000 total seats with 1,000 premium seats and 4,000 general admission seats.” More from this section", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:46:50.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
