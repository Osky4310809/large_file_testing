While none of the footage is new, AMC made them appear new with a cool blood-red saturation. \nIn less than a month, the second-half of The Walking Dead 's seventh season will commence. It'll kick off with Rick meeting with leaders of each community, trying to unite them all so that they can increase their odds of defeating the vicious Negan and his loyal flock of Saviors. \nRick’s group will find out yet again that the world isn’t what they thought it was. It’s much bigger than anything they’ve seen so far. While they have a singular purpose - to defeat Negan - it won’t come easy. More importantly, victory will require more than Alexandria. They need the numbers of the Kingdom and the Hilltop, but, similar to how Rick felt, Ezekiel (Khary Payton) and Gregory (Xander Berkeley) do not want bloodshed. To convince them otherwise will take more than speeches. The lengths Rick and the group will have to go to in order to find weapons, food and new fighters is nothing short of remarkable. \nWe’ll meet new survivors in incredible places. We’ll see Rick and the group tested in ways we’ve never seen before. We'll see treachery from people we trust. Rick is confident as he will see his group and many others band together with the common goal of taking down Negan. But no amount of planning will prepare the group for all-out war with Negan and his army. \nThe series stars Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes, Steven Yeun as Glenn , Norman Reedus as Daryl Dixon, Chandler Riggs as Carl, Lauren Cohan as Maggie, Danai Gurira as Michonne, Melissa McBride as Carol, Sonequa-Martin Green as Sasha, Michael Cudlitz as Abraham , and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Negan. \nThe Walking Dead is executive produced by Scott M. Gimple, Kirkman, Gale Anne Hurd, David Alpert, Greg Nicotero and Tom Luse. \nDon't miss the Season 7 midseason premiere of The Walking Dead on Sunday, February 12 at 9/8c.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:40:36.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
