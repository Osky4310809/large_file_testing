(Photo: JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images) On if the health care bill vote will be delayed \nIt’s scheduled for Thursday night. \n“That’s what I understand is the House’s schedule,” Spicer said. “That would be up to Ryan and McCarthy. We have continued to make progress every day.” On how the president’s meeting with the Freedom Caucus went \n“There were over 30 members there today. Some of them, frankly, came to say, ‘Thank you. What you’ve done so far has been an improvement.’ There were some members in the meeting who stood up and said, ‘I’m with you now.'” \n“We are not seeing people fall off. We are seeing people come on board.” On if Trump will take responsibility if the bill fails \n“At the end of the day we can’t make people vote,” Spicer said. “It’s the best bill that takes into consideration all of the goals and all of the values.” \n“We are not focused on blaming. We are focused on winning.” On if there is a plan B for health care \n“The president’s plan is to pass the bill tonight. That’s the president’s plan. That’s why he’s been fighting for it.” On what Trump’s reaction will be to Republicans who vote against health care \n“Republicans have made a commitment to their constituents, that if given the opportunity to have a Republican president or a Republican Senate or a Republican House, that they would enact a repeal and replace. He believes, as he mentioned, this is something that we’ve talked about. This is for real, and we are going to do what we pledged to the American people. The members of the House and the Senate have an obligation to fulfill their promise to the American people.” On intelligence revelations made by Rep. Devin Nunes Wednesday \n“He said he wanted to make it very clear that the revelations he had did not regard anything to do with Russia, and he wanted the president to understand that. At some point, there should be a concern about the substance, [not the process]. At some point, I would implore, urge, beg some of you to look into what happened and why did it happen.” On if the intelligence Nunes said he had is the same surveillance Trump says he has \n“We are not going to comment. My understanding, because I was not briefed, was that he spoke generally about what he had seen in these reports. I am not aware of the specific nature of it. On if the administration provided Nunes with intelligence information \n“That doesn’t pass the smell test.” On if Trump ‘associates’ had contact with Russian operatives \n“The way that associates is thrown around — I don’t understand what that means. When you use a term like associates, there’s a reason that you’re doing it, which is that you don’t have anything concrete. When you throw out a vague term like that, it’s a catch all.” \n“No, I cannot unequivocally say that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:08:05.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
