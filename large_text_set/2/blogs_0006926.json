It's FREE and always will be! \nMatteo Stucchi is a pastry chef from Monza, Italy, who has won quite a following on Instagram by building playful miniature scenes using his desserts and “tiny people”. \nInspired by Gulliver’s Travels , Matteo said he gets inspiration from other artists. “I get the ideas by seeing other artists on the web who create an interplay between objects and food; and from that, I focus on my desserts, in order to make them different and innovative in some way, using all my imagination to try to surprise my followers,” he told Reshareworthy.com. \nAs you’ll see in his creations below, the “Lilliputians” are hard at work, building delicious confections and fantastical scenes that almost make the desserts too good to eat.
