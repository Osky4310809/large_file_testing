Got it! \nClick the heart, it's called favoriting. Favorite the stuff you like. Got it! ✉ Email \nJapanese cultural experiences—such as ikebana , tea ceremonies, Zen gardens, and Japanese pottery—always remind me that a non-decorative space can also have a meaningful design. I love a rustic look myself, and also take time to think about something called \"wabi-sabi\" aesthetics. Here's what I mean: Photo by Mika Horie \nThe image to the left is a completely broken, old sliding door in my photo and paper-making studio. I have worked here for four years, and I never thought to repair it or get a new one. In the Japanese tradition of wabi-sabi, in fact, it isn't just an old door—it represents the passage of time. By replacing it, I could never re-create the all-natural, elemental sculpture of its shape. Advertisement \nSome of my friends ask me, \"When are you going to fix it?\" and I just answer, \"I am not going to do it.\" As long as I work as an artist, I will be capturing and representing Japanese aesthetics in my artworks. Before this space, I worked in modern buildings with no vintage aspects to their design. But now, I get to enjoy seeing this door everyday; it's about finding the beauty in imperfection and experiencing an awareness of the transience of things . \nIn Japanese, \"wabi\" connotes rustic simplicity, freshness, quietness, and natural and human-made objects; \"sabi\" stands for the beauty or serenity that comes with age, when the life of the object and its impermanence are evidenced in its patina and wear. I believe that wabi-sabi is one of the most unique ways to experience aesthetic pleasure in our daily lives, and probably the most characteristic principle of Japanese art. \nMika Horie is a photographer and visual artist based in Kyoto and Ishikawa. She specializes in photo printing on washi paper that she makes herself, using traditional methods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:19:09.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
