There were the cops who shared the photo of the old-fashioned pistol they confiscated. And the cops who responded to a woman’s tweet asking for pot. Some people say they shouldn’t post this kinda stuff online, but I’m all for our men and women in blue having a little fun with their extremely stressful jobs. They aren’t shaming people like those magazines full of embarrassing mugshots that you find on every gas station counter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:54:48.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
