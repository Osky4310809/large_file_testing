Upon the mention of our military, the entire room--Republican and Democrat--were on their feet. Well, almost everyone. \nUnbelievably, a handful of Democratic women who had dressed in white (for reasons hard to understand ) to protest the president, remained seated at the mention of our soldiers. \nYou would think supporting our military would be a bipartisan issue. \nShortly after that, Trump recognized fallen Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens, who died in a raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen in January. His widow, Carryn Owens, was one of Trump's special guests tonight, sitting right beside his daughter Ivanka. What followed was a beautiful tribute to her brave husband. Throughout the president's remarks, Mrs. Owens glanced to the sky and let her tears fall. It was one of the most emotional moments ever to occur at a joint session of Congress. . @POTUS recognizes Carryn Owens, widow of U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens. #Jointsession #JointAddress pic.twitter.com/oOV6YbDAZF — CSPAN (@cspan) March 1, 2017 \nIt really exposed the contrast of the moment. Dana Loesch said it best. All you women in white — you better get a look at Carryn Owens.
