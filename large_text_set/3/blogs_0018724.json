Attorney Steve Wise speaks to his supporters after arguing before the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division First Department on Thursday that chimpanzees deserve the rights of personhood. Kalhan Rosenblatt / NBC News \n\"All courts are bound by this irrational and biased rule,\" he said, adding that the ruling is not based in science. \nSix experts, including iconic primatologist Jane Goodall, filed affidavits supporting the claim that chimpanzees do have responsibilities and duties in their communities. \nRelated: Do Apes Deserve 'Personhood' Rights? \n\"As lawyers, we're used to having judges yell at us. Don't take it seriously as meaning that we lost or we won,\" Wise told dozens of supporters after the hearing. \"All I can say is, some cases I thought I lost — I won. Some cases I thought I won, I lost.\" Carmen Presti poses with Kiko, his chimpanzee, at the Primate Sanctuary in Niagara Falls, New York. Courtesy of Carmen Presti \nThe court's decision could take weeks. \nWise said whatever the decision, which could take weeks to come down, he's not going to be deterred. His next lawsuit will concern elephants, he said, and he'll continue to fight on behalf of cognitively complex animals. \n\"We've just begun to fight. Whether we win this one or whether we lose — if we win it and chimpanzees are persons in the state of New York, well that means we only have 49 more states and 199 countries to go,\" Wise said.
