But that doesn’t mean we’re complaining. Following up yesterday’s epic waterfight , Paramount has quit with the teasing and released the first five minutes of the upcoming movie in full.\nIntroduced by protagonist The Major (a.k.a Scarlett Johansson), the clip sees the creepy AF geisha-robots staging a dinner coup before coming to blows (or bullets) with a group of unsavory criminals. It might only be five minutes long, but there’s enough headshots to satisfy even the most barbarous Call of Duty fan.\nWatch the clip above, and check out the movie when it hits theaters on March 31. Alternatively, you could just watch the below for a pretty good idea as to how it pans out.\n\n\n\nNow check out the first trailer for Netflix’s live-action Death Note movie.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:49:11.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
