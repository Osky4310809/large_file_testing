Slot to Auburn Links Bruce Pearl coaches against Kentucky at Rupp Arena. (Photo: Mark Zerof, USA TODAY Sports) \nAUBURN, Ala. — Auburn played strong, tough and was within striking distance until the final 6 minutes Saturday at Kentucky. \nNo. 6 Kentucky, however, was just too powerful and its talent took over in the final minutes as the Wildcats cruised to a 92-72 victory. Auburn failed to score in the final 4:28 of the game as the Wildcats finished the game on fire with Malik Monk leading the way with a game-high 24 points. \nAuburn was carried by senior guard T.J. Dunans' career-high 23 points on 10 of 20 shooting. Mustapha Heron added 11. \nLet's get to the analysis. Auburn played well enough Auburn shot more than 50 percent from the floor for most of the game, and the Tigers found a way to attack the basket and find a way to score against the bigger Kentucky frontcourt. The problem continues to be defense, especially on the perimeter, but credit Kentucky for that turnaround on offense. The ultra-talented group rebounded from a 1 of 9 performance beyond the arc against Vanderbilt to hit seven of its first nine 3-pointers to start the game. Still, Auburn needs to challenge those shots because teams hitting 3-pointer after 3-pointer against the Tigers is nothing new this season. Another issue: rebounding (40-28 at minus-12) and free-throw shooting (5 of 15). The Tigers need to fix the free throw shooting and perimeter defense. There is no reason a team should hit 58 percent of their 3-pointers against the Tigers. Offensive effort was hot to start Auburn was absolutely on fire and grabbed several leads in the first 10 minutes of the game. The Tigers were shooting as high as 71 percent in the first half before things cooled down a bit. Auburn was shooting 57 percent in the first 11 minutes of the second half, too, and pulled within four points thanks to an incredible effort by senior guard T.J. Dunans. Auburn has been a slow-starting team for most of the season, but something got into the Tigers heading into Rupp Arena. Maybe it was the bright lights, the idea of playing the best SEC team or the fact the program has not won in Lexington since 1988. Whatever it was, Auburn needs to bring that effort to start games the rest of the season. There is a crucial stretch coming up, and Auburn needs to win the next two games to keep postseason (NIT) hopes alive. Dunans the key Too often Auburn has settled for 3-pointers this season, but T.J. Dunans has long been the key to Auburn slashing to the basket. We’ve seen glimpses — and we definitely saw the potential before he was injured last season — but he was absolutely on fire slashing to the basket and hitting shots from the perimeter when spots were open on the floor. He scored 12 straight points at one point to help pull the Tigers within four points midway through the second half. Auburn couldn’t do much after that, however, and the talent of Malik Monk and Co. blazed through the Tigers’ lineup as Austin Wiley had to take a seat on the bench in the final 6 minutes after fouling out. Dunans, however, was the key to Auburn staying close to the Wildcats. He needs to continue to play and fill the role as a driver to the basket. Next 2 games crucial Auburn hosts LSU and Alabama in back-to-back games next week. Both games are winnable and absolutely crucial to the Tigers’ postseason hopes. Alabama knocked off LSU by 15 points on Saturday. A loss to LSU at home would be devastating for the Tigers, who are already 1-4 in the SEC. The Tigers can claw back near .500 wth a pair of wins against LSU (which might be the second-worst team in the conference) and rival Alabama. Auburn then must travel to South Carolina, which looks the part of an NCAA team at the moment, and gets a “break” by traveling to TCU for the Big 12/SEC Challenge. Two losses next week would not end the season, obviously, but it certainly would derail the postseason hopes (NIT) for the Tigers with a deep 1-6 SEC conference record.
