Lewandowski, Muller and Alaba were all on the scoresheet (Photo: REUTERS) Arturo Vidal fired home the opener (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) Read More Ancelotti reaches 1,000 games as manager - and gets a deliciously odd present \nRobert Lewandowski helped himself to a hat-trick, including one penalty, as they maintained their five point lead over RB Leipzig, 3-1 winners over Köln at the top of the table. \nArturo Vidal put Bayern in front, driving home after a clever touch from Thomas Muller before Lewandowski’s penalty made it 2-0 after 24 minutes. \nLewandowski helped himself to a second three minutes before the break, and then the league’s top scorer made it 19 Bundesliga goals and 28 in all competitions in the 54th minute, when rolling confidently past a helpless Rene Adler. Within two minutes, David Alaba had made it five. Lewandowski coolly converts (Photo: REUTERS) \nHSV could have been forgiven for thinking that would be that, particularly as Ancelotti replaced Lewandowski with Portuguese starlet Renato Sanches and withdrew the outstanding Thiago to hand French winger Kingsley Coman minutes. \nComan has endured a difficult second season in Bavaria, but the 20-year-old soon made his presence felt, scoring twice in nine minutes. \nFirst he evaded a Johannes Djourou challenge to side-foot home from close range, before thrashing past Adler in the 69th minute as the ball sat up kindly on the edge of the box.
