Health care decisions for women should NOT be made by politicians in Washington. They should be made by a woman & her doctor. #HR7 pic.twitter.com/rQkFhBiTTp \n— Rep. Dan Kildee (@RepDanKildee) January 24, 2017 \nBecause of the Medicaid piece, the Hyde Amendment pretty directly targets low-income women and disproportionately women of color. \nIt was originally proposed as a method to stop abortions three years after the Supreme Court ruled that abortions are legal in Roe v Wade . \nThe Hyde Amendment had its 40th anniversary in 2016. It was introduced by Henry Hyde, a Republican congressman. In 1977, Hyde said , \nI certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman or a poor woman […] Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the (Medicaid) bill. \nThe Hyde Amendment had to be voted in by the Congress every single year when voting on budgets. This new HR 7 act makes it permanent, so there is no opportunity every year to get rid of it. The right to choose is meaningless w/out the access to choose. Anti-choice bill on the floor today takes away access https://t.co/Rr1jmUZiTT pic.twitter.com/5ht74paIBv \n— Carolyn B. Maloney (@RepMaloney) January 24, 2017 \nDr. Willie Parker, board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said in a statement on Tuesday, \nThe House of Representatives’ vote today on H.R. 7 was a vote to punish women who seek abortions on the basis of how much money they earn, where they live, and how they are insured. […] While this vote is not surprising, I am disappointed for my patients and their families. \nYamani Hernandez, executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds , which provides money to women seeking abortions, added in her own statement on Tuesday, \nBy passing this bill on to the House, Congress has shown complete and utter disregard for the health and welfare of those seeking abortions, particularly those who cannot afford it. \nPro-choice advocates were on their way to getting rid of the Hyde Amendment. It was added as part of the Democratic platform this past summer with the campaign of Hillary Clinton . I am appalled by the moral arrogance of @HouseGOP imposing their views on the millions of women who want to make their own decisions. #HR7 pic.twitter.com/HnocmbB8dr \n— (((Rep. Nadler))) (@RepJerryNadler) January 24, 2017 \nCampaigns such as All* Above All have been working to undo Hyde. Last year, Democratic Representative Barbara Lee introduced the EACH Woman Act, which was supposed to undo the effects of Hyde. \nOnce Donald Trump won the election and Republicans had control of Congress, however, women’s reproductive rights were put in peril . \nThis is just the latest attack on reproductive rights. \nOn Monday, Trump reinstated the so-called “ Global Gag Rule ” that barred federal funding for foreign aid organizations that provide information about abortion. Federal funding for foreign aid that provides abortion is already barred under the Helms Amendment .
