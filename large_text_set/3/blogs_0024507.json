The bank also pledged its commitment to help Small and Medium Scale Enterprises, SMEs, in Nigeria particularly, the South East, to grow the zone’s economy. \nManaging Director/CEO, Fidelity Bank Plc, Nnamdi Okonkwo disclosed this during the bank’s customers’ forum, saying that so far, the bank has disbursed N2.3 billion to 102 customers to support their businesses. \nOkonkwo, who expressed happiness over the level of support and patronage from the region, said the bank also needs to reciprocate by supporting them with finance to grow their businesses. “Our people are entrepreneurial in nature and there are plenty of small businesses all over the place. Some have export ideas, but they do not know the documentations involved. \n“We are going to provide a more structured access to quality information that can help your business. What we appeal to people is to ensure they always pay back when they receive loans from the bank. So far, our loans are doing well and we do not have incidences of bad loan,” he stated. \nChairman, Board of Directors , Fidelity Bank Plc, Mr. Ernest Ebi, who was also graced both occasions said Fidelity Bank has over the years become a big bank that cannot be ignored by any serious business concern, and has remained true to helping its customers break new frontiers in business. “We are here to connect with our customers and to let them know that we do not take them for granted, and that we are ready to help them out with their businesses.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:18:55.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
