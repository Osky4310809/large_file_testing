Townhall employs the technique of everyone reading the same script and mashing it up to create one clip that includes all participants. \"It's your job to be creative,\" the group tells celebrities. \"And yet how many of these lame-ass videos have you made that look exactly like this?\" \"You entertain us,\" Katie Pavlich says. \"It's literally your whole job,\" Guy Benson chimes in. The group then demands that celebrities reject anything that is \"anti-original, anti-interesting, anti-convincing.\" \"We demand that you try harder,\" the group says. \"If not, we'll continue to not care,\" Mary Katherine Ham says. Other participants include S.E. Cupp and Mollie Hemingway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T03:18:17.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
