To try and create something out of nothing and he was terrific again today. \n\"He got man of the match and I am sure he has got about nine of them at home after this season. He is in great form, long may that continue. Just like the rest of the boys. Everyone is in great form.\" \nCahill will likely be joining up with England later this month, while Hazard heads off with Belgium soon, and the club's stand-in captain was keen to urge Chelsea to maintain focus in a strange month containing only two Premier League fixtures. \nWATCH: Mullerâ€™s priceless reaction \n\"We have worked tremendously hard, up until this point, and we have got a lot of games left but it is a funny month as we have the cup next week and then we have got a league game and internationals,\" he added. \n\"I was speaking today thinking we have two important games this month to get in a healthy position and that should be our aim. It is bizarre that we have got only two league games in a month. We have got the first one out of the way and a bit of time off until the next one.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:36:10.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
