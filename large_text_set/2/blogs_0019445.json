In a former avatar, he might first have laughed to the point of nearly tearing a stomach muscle, before saying: “I’d say they’re out of their minds.” \nFor all you know, he still thinks that. He just isn’t saying it. What he did say was this: “We are not worried about the opposition’s combinations, or what they want to come up with. We are pretty comfortable with what we want to do. We are pretty sure about how we want to go about this game and the series. That’s our strength, not focusing on opposition too much.” Josh Hazlewood could miss out on selection for the Australian team to play India in the first Test. Source: News Corp Australia \nFor the record, Hazlewood has 109 Test wickets at 24.78 and is currently the highest-ranked pace bowler in the ICC rankings, at No.3. He’s tall, has a lovely, repeatable action, and concedes less than three runs an over. The men who might allegedly replace him — Glenn Maxwell and Ashton Agar — aren’t exactly spin bowlers in the Richie Benaud-Ashley Mallett league. \nThat Australia’s team management would even contemplate something so daft, four Tests on from sacking half the playing XI, is a commentary of how poorly the sport continues to be analysed, especially by those that should know better. \nIn the build-up to this series, there have been so many sound bites, several from former pros who should know better, about the raging turners or dustbowls likely to greet Australia. Well, here’s the thing. The Indian season began in September. Most of the pitches are old and tired. Kohli himself was convinced that the Pune surface would slow, low and very dry. The Pune pitch showing its many cracks Source: Supplied Mitch Marsh on Asia form 0:42 \nIndia have already played nine Tests this home season. Anyone that’s watched even a session or two from those games — three against New Zealand, five against England and the most recent against Bangladesh — could tell you that not one of them was played on a Bunsen burner. \nEngland crossed 400 in the first innings in three of five Tests. Bangladesh made 388 and 250. Sorry, if that’s your definition of a dust bowl, you obviously didn’t watch the carnage at the Wankhede in 2004, when Damien Martyn, Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman played innings of rare majesty even as wickets fell like pins in a bowling alley around them. \nAnd here’s the other thing. Of the 20 visiting bowlers to have taken 30 wickets or more in India, only seven have been spinners. Among Australians, Benaud leads the way with 52 wickets at 18.38. Shane Warne’s 34 came at a much higher cost (43.11), but it’s the numbers for four pace greats that are really eye-catching. Garth McKenzie (34 at 19.26), Jason Gillespie (33 at 21.72), Glenn McGrath (33 at 21.3) and Alan Davidson (30 at 15.76) were all part of series victories in India. Stuart Clark's Test side 1:48 \nHazlewood has the potential to be as good one day. And though he hasn’t spoken to the triumvirate — Gillespie, McGrath and Michael Kasprowicz — that led Australia to a 2-1 victory in 2004, the last time they so much as won a Test on these shores, he’s well aware of the adjustments they made to be so successful. \n“In Australia, you get good bounce most of the games,” he said two days before the start of the Test. “Obviously, you are not going to get that here and you have to look to get wickets in other ways, whether it’s through reverse swing, or cutters on wickets that can spin and grip as well. \n“I have read a few articles [about 2004]. I guess it’s always the case that in India, you bowl a lot straighter. In Australia, you bowl in that channel on and outside the off stump. In India, you bowl a lot tighter, on middle and off. I think it’s about drying up the runs.” \nAustralia’s 4-0 loss in 2013 had much to do with their inability to stem the flow of runs — India scored at 3.72 over the series. Hazlewood may not run through sides in these conditions, but he offers the promise of control. After a warm-up fixture that saw both specialist spinners carted all over the park, it’s ludicrous that Australia would even consider going into a game without that. \nDileep Premachandran is editor-in-chief of Wisden India .
