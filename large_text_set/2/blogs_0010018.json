I wish I had no money most days. I say to myself, ‘My life would be so much easier if I hadn’t won.’ \n“People look at me and think, ‘I wish I had her lifestyle, I wish I had her money.’ But they don’t realise the extent of my stress. \n“I have material things but apart from that my life is empty. What is my purpose in life?” Jane Park, 21, was only 17-years-old when she scooped £1million (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \nAstonishingly this is not the first time young lotto winners have complained about how their stupendous windfalls ruined their lives. \nMeet Britain's youngest winners and how they spent their fortune.... Callie Rogers Callie attempted suicide after she frittered money on parties, drugs and cosmetic surgery (Photo: PA) \nAt 16 Callie Rogers became Britain’s youngest lottery jackpot winner, scooping £1.9million. \nBut the prize for the £3.08 an hour Co-op checkout worker proved more of a curse than a blessing. \nShe gave up her job and frittered most of her money on parties, drugs, cosmetic surgery, holidays and gifts. But she felt lonely and she even attempted suicide. \nTen years after her 2003 windfall, Callie only had £2,000 in the bank and was training to be a nurse. She then said she was never happier. \nCallie said: \"I can’t believe ten years have passed since I stood holding that huge cheque. It feels like a lifetime ago. \n\"I don't think of myself as a lottery winner - I try to forget the ups and downs I’ve been through and just feel like a normal person. \n\"It was too much money for someone so young. Even if you say your life won’t change, it does – and often not for the better.\" Mickey 'Lotto Lout' Carroll The ex-binman won £9.7million when he was 19 and went on a spree of cocaine, gambling and hookers (Photo: PA) \nSwaggering Carroll became Britain’s most notorious Lotto loser after buying a lucky dip in 2002 while wearing an electronic crime tag. \nThe ex-binman won £9.7million when he was 19 and went on a spree – cocaine, gambling and hookers. He was nicknamed the Lotto Lout after getting an Asbo for terrorising ­neighbours and being jailed twice for drugs and affray. \nAfter his winnings drained away he was forced to live on benefits, then worked in biscuit factory in 2011 before his current job in a slaughterhouse. Leah Sumray Leah was jailed for 14 days for missing a court date after she jetted off on holiday instead (Photo: SWNS) \nScratch card winner Leah Sumray, who scooped £1million at the age of 21, was jailed for 14 days after she went on holiday instead of giving evidence in court in 2009. \nShe ignored a witness summons and went to Fuerteventura instead of attending Truro crown court in Cornwall where she should have testified against a man on assault charges. \nLeah, of St Ives, who earned £4.60 an hour before her win, was arrested at Bristol Airport when she returned and taken before a judge.
