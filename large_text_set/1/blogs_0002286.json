Bush administration. \n“They shared with me some of their advice,” Spicer said, adding with a joke: “I had my own version of a press conference with Josh and Jen and fired off questions on everything from logistics to how certain things currently operate.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:20:39.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
