Max Scherzer would not commit to being ready for opening day. Knuckle is healed, but still has symptoms. Played catch today. \n— Chelsea Janes (@chelsea_janes) February 16, 2017 \nManager Dusty Baker is thinking of alternative plans in case Scherzer isn’t ready. Dusty said Nats have to make plans in case Scherzer isn't ready to start the season, but that they just don't know yet. \n— Chelsea Janes (@chelsea_janes) February 16, 2017 Dusty made two obvious but important points re Max: 1) better knuckle than elbow/shoulder. 2) fewer innings early means more strength late. \n— Chelsea Janes (@chelsea_janes) February 16, 2017 \nScherzer, the 2016 National League Cy Young winner, was 20-7 with a 2.96 ERA in 228-plus innings in 2016. He struck out 284 batters, including a spectacular 20-strikeout performance against the Detroit Tigers on May 11. \nThere was some good news at Nationals camp as Stephen Straburg looked ready to return after an injury-marred 2016 campaign. Stephen Strasburg is throwing off a mound. Seems unrestricted. pic.twitter.com/zoR8eKn5IA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:44:49.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
