But by not following certain rules and regulations, you may loose a part of your hard-earned money. Moreover, you may also have to provide more proofs for claiming the amount, which might delay the payment. In the new regime of EPFO, the non-Aadhaar card holder needs to provide extra information while claiming for funds through the newly-designed one page Composite Claim Form. \nEven those who are having the Aadhaar card must get it linked to their bank account in order to enjoy the seamless process of PF withdrawal. Moreover, one should also get one’s PAN card made if one doesn’t have it, because if you do not do so, you may be liable to pay heavy tax while claiming your PF money. \nHere are the following extra things which you need to mention in your non–Aadhaar Composite Claim Form: \nPF account number: \nMost of the citizens do not have the Universal Account Number (UAN) with them. UAN readily captures the KYC details of its member in order to eliminate the dependency on the employer and enhances the service quality. This way it helps you to view your accumulated PF funds under one platform where one employer or the other links your member ID with your UAN from time to time while switching the job. \nIf in case you do not have the UAN number, you will need to provide your PF number to the EPFO department by mentioning the details in the Composite Claim Form. \nYou may also watch: \nAadhaar number (for seeding): \nFor EPFO subscribers, who are yet to seed Aadhaar and Bank details with their UAN, the new Composite Claim Form (Non-Aadhar) replaces the existing Forms No 19, 10C & 31. The new single page Composite Claim Form (Non-Aadhaar) can be submitted with the attestation of employers. \nDate of Birth: \nDate of birth is always mentioned on your Aadhaar card and PAN card, but if you are not having it then in such a case you need to mention the birth date in the Composite Claim Form (Non-Aadhaar). \nFather’s/ Husbands Name: \nYou need to provide the detailed name of your father or the detailed name of your husband. You also need to certify that the particulars provided by you are true to your knowledge. \nBank account details for payment: \nNon-Aadhaar card holder needs to carry a copy of canceled cheque and if they do not have the same, they can get the copy of the first page of their bank passbook. The details on the first page should be clearly mentioned. \nYou may also watch: \nTDS implication while submitting claim form \nIn the facility, having a PAN number is must. Otherwise, you will be charged heavy tax. Firstly, TDS is going to be deducted if the services are less than of 5 years. Secondly, if you have a PAN card number, then TDS will get deducted at 10 per cent, while if you do not have a PAN Card, then the TDS at 34.608 per cent will be deducted from your balance amount. However, no TDS is going to be deducted in case the total balance is less than Rs 50000. \nThe following clauses are applicable to both the forms whether you are filling your Aadhaar-based or Non-Aadhaar based Composite Claim form. \nSubmission of the Composite Claim Form (Aadhaar/ Non-Aadhaar) should be duly signed by the EPF subscriber, which will be interpreted as ‘self-certification’ for the said partial withdrawals, for which no document would be required to be submitted to the EPFO offices.
