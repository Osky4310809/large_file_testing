And especially people called Friend. \nReferee Kevin Friend was in a forgiving mood with the Swede on on Saturday afternoon, deciding not to sent him off despite his clear elbow to the face of Bournemouth's Tyrone Mings - who had just introduced his studs to the side of the big man's head. \nBoth men should have gone, really, but what was most interesting about the whole affair was the sight of Zlatan chatting to Friend as the referee decided what his next move was going to be. It ended up being sending off Andrew Surman.
