And yes, they’re happy tears, so get ready to be moved. \nIn 2014, Oklahoma-based photographer Lora Scantling wrote a Facebook post offering a special photo shoot for young girls who had been diagnosed with cancer . She chose three girls who’d just started chemotherapy, Rheann, Ainsley, and Riley, and produced a heart-wrenching and unforgettable image of the girls hugging each other.\nNeedless to say, the poignant photo went viral, and now the Oklahoma girls have reunited to celebrate life cancer-free , two years later.\nA post shared by Lora Scantling (@scantling_photography) on Apr 7, 2016 at 9:23am PDT \nIn an Instagram post about the reunion photo, Scantling wrote, “ Look at these 3 getting so big! … I love that these 3 are still inspiring others and helping raise childhood cancer awareness! All 3 are still doing great and in remission/cancer free.” \nIf you’re anything like us, you’re feeling Kate Winslet’s mixture of emotions at the Oscars right now.\nWe’re not sure whether it’s relief, an over-abundance of love, sadness, or happiness that’s causing this emotional swell. Maybe all of the above. But regardless, it is so lovely to see the image of Rheann, now 9, Ainsley, 7, and Riley, 6, in good health and good spirits.\nA post shared by Lora Scantling (@scantling_photography) on Sep 20, 2015 at 8:39am PDT \nScantling explained her motivation behind the original photo in an Instagram caption, writing, “ I was inspired by [photographer] Anne Geddes…and chose cancer because at the time my step dad was fighting cancer. I wanted to take a picture that would speak a thousand words at a glance.” \nWe’d say her pictures have definitely achieved that goal. And, according to an interview published by Peopl e this week , Scantling has offered to continue taking pictures of the three girls together every year for the rest of their lives.\nA post shared by Lora Scantling (@scantling_photography) on Jul 1, 2015 at 7:28pm PDT \n“They’re inspiring to so many that I’m happy to keep taking photos for the rest of their lives,” she explained. “Besides an annual photo shoot, I’d love to take pictures of their high school graduations, their weddings, all of their biggest milestones. To have them all alive and doing well is wonderful. It’s like they’re family now. She added, “The girls have become good friends ever since their unfortunate circumstances brought them together, and an annual photo shoot of the small warriors sounds like a great way to celebrate their lives! We are definitely here for it.”\nA post shared by Lora Scantling (@scantling_photography) on Sep 19, 2015 at 7:29am PDT \nWe can’t wait to watch Rheann, Ainsley, and Rylie grow into amazing women who continue to support each other through difficult times. Okay, we’re crying again.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:31:36.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
