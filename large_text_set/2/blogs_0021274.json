The two need no introductions as they have been old sparring mates under Freddie Roach. \nPacquiao's adviser Mike Koncz confirmed that it was indeed the Filipino icon who tweeted the development. \n\"I have no statement at this time other than to confirm that yes, that is Manny's tweet, and we have come to terms to fight Amir khan with him and his team,\" Koncz told Philstar.com in a text message. Pacquiao, a Philippine senator and the sport's only eight-division world title holder, was initially set to fight Jeff Horn in Australia. He recently came back from retirement and took the welterweight crown from Jessie Vargas. \nLittle has been bared regarding the venue of the Pacquiao - Khan slugfest, but the former has hinted on fighting in the United Arab Emirates. — Denison Rey A.
