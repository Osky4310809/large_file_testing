We are just trying to do our job by winning every game.” \nUnited were in danger of seeing their recent productive run ended by defeat at the hands of Liverpool, with a Zlatan Ibrahimovic header rescuing them a point six minutes from time in a 1-1 draw. \nMourinho’s men displayed commendable battling qualities as they fought their way back into the game, while the introduction of experienced internationals off the bench once again helped to highlight the strength in depth within their ranks. \n“Not only Marouane [Fellaini] but also Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata put freshness in the team,” Mkhitaryan explained. \nGoal machine Ibra matches PL greats \n“They helped us a lot up front and we are happy that they could change something in our game. We are happy to have them coming on.” \nUnited will be looking to get back to winning ways on Saturday when they travel to Stoke City, with a four-point gap currently separating them from Arsenal in fourth.
