He could have fell out or anything,” she said. \nAccording to WJZ, the dental programs became more common following a 2007 incident when a 12-year-old Prince George County boy died from an infected tooth . \nThe school, for its part, is claiming Flemming signed a waiver at the beginning of the year, permitting the school to perform the procedure. However, the third-grader’s mother said she thought the permission slip was only for routine cleanings, not tooth extractions. \n“I just don’t understand how a school or a company can take it in their hands to do something like this to a child,” the distraught mother said. \nFlemming said Michael is scheduled to see their family dentist Monday.
