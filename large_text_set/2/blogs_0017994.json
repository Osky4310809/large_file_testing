Those that could hinder it include anti-inflammation meds called glucocorticoids (which can treat autoimmune disorders or asthma), the diabetes injection insulin, the hypertension drug metoprolol, allergy medications known as first-generation antihistamines, and the antidepressant paroxetine, also known as Paxil or Seroxat. \nBecause people with obesity are especially prone to some of these conditions, this can make weight gain a self-perpetuating cycle. \nAnd the problem is, doctors without expertise in weight management often prescribe these meds without taking into account their effects on weight gain. So patients might take them without realizing they could promote weight gain , lead author Leon Igel, M.D., explained in a press release. \nBut all these conditions can be treated with drugs that tdon’t affect weight—or may even decrease it. The antidepressants fluoxetine (Prozac), bupropion (Wellbutrin), and sertraline, second- and third-generation antihistamines, inhaled and topical anti-inflammatory drugs, antihypertensives called ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for diabetes are less likely to cause weight gain. \nSo before you start a medication, research the side effects. And if you’re already on one of the drugs that can cause weight gain and are struggling to reach or maintain a healthy weight, talk to your doctor. He or she may be able to help you choose an alternative, or at least figure out how to combat the medication’s unintended consequences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:54:42.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
