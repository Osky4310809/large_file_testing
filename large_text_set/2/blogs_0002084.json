However, fans requested we collaborate for the third part of ‘ Singam ‘, and we obliged. Luckily, Hari had another script ready and we were good to go right away.” Talking about the experience of working with Hari, he said: “I’m still in awe of the pace at which he works. You feel like you’re always on the toes on his set. Usually, you shoot three or four shots in a day when you’re working with any director.
