David Sullivan also issued a stark warning to Slaven Bilic last week \nAnd Sullivan said: \"I think all we can do after Saturday's defeat is say sorry to the supporters. \n\"To be 2-0 down after seven minutes of any football match, be it in the Premier League or in your local Sunday League, makes it very difficult to get a positive result. \n\"In parts of the second half we were very good. But, we need to be good before we are losing. WATCH: Highlights of West Ham 2-3 Leicester \n\"We have to find out why we are conceding so many goals and fix it because it is obviously harder to win games when you concede two or three goals in a game than if you keep a clean sheet. \n\"The next few games now become vital for our season. We go to Hull City, then to Arsenal, before we welcome Swansea City to London Stadium.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T14:19:39.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
