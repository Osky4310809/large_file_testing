That made it the best week in the demo since November 5, 2012, and the most total viewers since October 27, 2008. \nNo. 2, FNC’s The O’Reilly Factor, averaged 691,000 demo viewers over 4 nights. Friday night Fox News ran a special edition of The Five at 8 p.m. In fact, O’Reilly hasn’t hosted a Friday night show since inauguration day, two months ago today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:07:41.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
