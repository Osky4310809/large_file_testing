Steptoe’s words, too, go straight for the heart, redeeming often harsh facts of the artist’s life by focusing on how both his strength and his pain powered his art. \n38 pp. Little, Brown. $17.99. (Picture book; ages 4 to 8) Photo Credit From \"Muhammad Ali: A Champion is Born\" ​Muhammad Ali: A Champion Is Born By Gene Barretta. Illustrated by Frank Morrison. \n“He owed it all to a stolen bicycle,” Barretta writes in this playful, dynamic look at the champion’s quest for greatness. We see how one childhood incident — the young Cassius Clay reported the theft to a police officer, who invited him to learn to box — set the stage for a long career. There are highlights of his boxing fame, later years and racial-justice and humanitarian work. Morrison (“The Quickest Kid in Clarksville”) gives the art a joyful zing and a serious yet eminently kid-friendly vibe. \n40 pp. Katherine Tegen/HarperCollins. $17.99. (Picture book; ages 4 to 8) Photo Credit From \"The Legendary Miss Lena Horne\" ​The Legendary Miss Lena Horne By Carole Boston Weatherford. Illustrated by Elizabeth Zunon. \nThe veteran biographer Weatherford stirringly tells Lena Horne’s extraordinary story — her birth into a high-achieving black family; her itinerant childhood; the showbiz career she built while enduring Jim Crow and Hollywood racism; her place in the civil rights movement; the ways “music saved her” to the end. Zunon (“Don’t Call Me Grandma”) plays with shadow and light to suggest the hidden depths of a very public life. The book’s sizzling clarity recalls Horne’s own voice. \n32 pp. Atheneum. $17.99. (Picture book; ages 5 to 9) Photo Credit From \"The Youngest Marcher\" The Youngest Marcher By Cynthia Levinson. Illustrated by Vanessa Brantley Newton. \nIt’s one of the more shocking and little-known stories of the civil rights movement: In 1963, the City of Birmingham jailed hundreds of kids for joining the Children’s March. Among them was 9-year-old Audrey Faye Hendricks, taken from her family to spend a week behind bars, eating “oily grits” and sleeping on a bare mattress. Levinson and Newton keep her story bright and snappy, emphasizing the girl’s eagerness to make a difference and her proud place in her community. \n32 pp. Atheneum. $17.99. (Picture book; ages 5 to 9) Photo Credit From \"Frederick Douglass: The Lion Who Wrote History\" ​Frederick Douglass: The Lion Who Wrote History By Walter Dean Myers. Illustrated by Floyd Cooper. \nDouglass’s life story has a magisterial glow in this posthumous work from the esteemed Myers. (It stands taller than most picture books, a fitting design decision.) Myers’s words pointedly convey the centrality of reading and “careful decisions” to Douglass’s struggle for freedom and his later public work, offering an anchor to children trying to comprehend the cruelties of American slavery. Cooper’s realistic, slightly smudged art feels equally consequential, balancing dignity and emotion. \n40 pp. Harper/HarperCollins. $17.99.
