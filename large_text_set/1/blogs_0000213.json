Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images. 5402221 \nWith just over two weeks left in office, President Barack Obama wants you to know that it’s for him it’s “always been about you.” “In 1796, as George Washington set the precedent for a peaceful, democratic transfer of power, he also set a precedent by penning a farewell address to the American people. And over the 220 years since, many American presidents have followed his lead,” Obama said in a blog post about the speech he plans to deliver in Chicago on Jan. 10. He added: “I’m just beginning to write my remarks. But I’m thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you’ve changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.” The president said in the post that since he’s entered office “we’ve faced our fair share of challenges, and come through them stronger.” Obama said that this due to Americans not letting “go of a belief that has guided us ever since our founding — our conviction that, together, we can change this country for the better.” The president said he hopes Americans join him for the event, “because, for me, it’s always been about you.” (RELATED: Obama Mentions Himself 45 Times During Memorial Speech For Dallas Officers)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T19:27:50.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
