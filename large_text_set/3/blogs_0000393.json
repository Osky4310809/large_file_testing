I would never do that. That's not in my game. Hard and fair is how I like to tackle but off the ball stuff like that isn't in my game. \n\"He [Ibrahimovic] is who he is, he's a good player, he's a physical player. I knew what sort of battle I was going to be in for coming here. And that's what we had all day, it was a battle. \n\"There was maybe an elbow when the ball came in after, I didn't see it, I felt it. But what happened after that with Surman getting sent off, I didn't see it.\" \nIbrahimovic also saw a second-half penalty saved by goalkeeper Artur Boruc as United failed to climb the table and remain sixth. Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Tyrone Mings were both fortunate to remain on the pitch after their clashes. \nUnited captain Wayne Rooney said after the match that he expected Mings to face retrospective action for the incident \nHe told Sky: \"I don't think he [the referee] has seen Mings stamp on Zlatan's head -- I was right there. It's wrong. \n\"Everyone likes to go in for tackle in the game but to try and stamp on a player's head is wrong -- there's no place for it. I'm sure there will be punishment.\" \nJose Mourinho refused to be drawn on the incident after the match, \nThe United manager said: \"I don't like to speak after matches. The referee was there; if you ask me if I'm going to be happy if Mings gets a four or five-game ban, I really don't care about it. He knows what he did better than anyone, better than the referee the intention or the emotion of the moment.\" \nInformation from the Press Association was used in this report. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T18:08:51.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
