I can’t even. pic.twitter.com/MvI9Jqp1vy \n— Dan Froomkin (@froomkin) February 16, 2017 \nHaving carefully avoided questions from all but a handful of friendly reporters in recent days as evidence of his stumbling performance as president mounted, Trump devoted less than 60 seconds to introducing his new secretary of labor nominee Alexander Acosta. Then he launched into what amounted to a 20-minute campaign speech blaming reporters in the room for portraying an administration in chaos when it was, he said, “running like a fine-tuned machine.”\nPresident Trump: “This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.” https://t.co/OBLCVoLF0C https://t.co/0Zeckvjt7P \n— CNN (@CNN) February 16, 2017 \nWhen he opened the floor to questions, Trump responded to them in a sarcastic, rambling, not entirely coherent manner, frequently adopting the tone of an insult comic, roasting reporters as if at the annual correspondents’ dinner. He raged at the profusion of leaks that have been coming out of his administration — and at what he called the “fake news” that was based on those leaks.\nThe performance, which prompted an outpouring of disbelief from viewers around the world, was the clearest example yet of Trump treating reporters who fail to flatter him as “the opposition party,” as his chief White House strategist, Steve Bannon, explained to The New York Times last month.\nRussian friend texts me during the presser: “What an embarrassment.”\n— Julia Ioffe (@juliaioffe) February 16, 2017 \nI think both houses of Congress should assemble and watch the video of this press conference w/o interruption, then talk about what to do.\n— southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) February 16, 2017 \nI was watching trump’s presser at the gym and I had to stop cycling and leave cause I was laughing too much\n— tiny jihad (@mirahwood) February 16, 2017 \n@daveweigel .

Lewis (@mattklewis) February 16, 2017 \nThere were so many jaw-dropping moments that it is hard to compile a highlight reel, but here, for the convenience of readers who might lack the strength or stamina to take in the whole spectacle , are six of the most remarkable moments.\nTrump Says He Did Not Direct Flynn to Discuss Sanctions With Russia, but Was Glad Flynn Did, Even Though He Fired Him for Doing It \nThis is just as confusing as it sounds. Asked if he had directed his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the United States in December, after the election but before the inauguration, Trump said, “No, I did not.” He then added: “It certainly would’ve been okay with me if he did it. I would’ve directed him to do it, if I thought he wasn’t doing it. I didn’t direct him, but I would’ve directed him.”\nGot that?\nTrump says he didn’t direct Flynn to discuss Russian sanctions—but “I would have directed him to do it.” pic.twitter.com/p2ziUt2bos \n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 16, 2017 \n“I didn’t direct him but I would have directed him,” Trump says of Flynn talking sanctions to Russia. Classic psychopath talk for “I did it”\n— Dan Froomkin (@froomkin) February 16, 2017 \nAmong those baffled by Trump’s reply was Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn, Jr., who retweeted a former Breitbart reporter’s confused summary of it.\nFlynn’s Son Retweeted This. pic.twitter.com/MWqSXQztz2 \n— Yashar (@yashar) February 16, 2017 \n\nTrump’s claim that there was nothing at all wrong with Flynn’s decision to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador seemed to be undermined a short time later by the breaking news that Flynn had reportedly lied about having done so in an interview with the FBI in January. Lying to federal agents, as Flynn well knows , is a felony offense.\nTrump also maintained that reports of his own ties to Russia were “fake news put out by the media,” and insisted that he has no financial dealings with Russians.\nTrump: “Speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia” pic.twitter.com/KzA6y4VvSl \n— BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) February 16, 2017 \nThat is a direct contradiction of a statement made by his son, Donald Jr. “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia,” the younger Trump told a real estate publication in 2008 . “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” he explained, “say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York.”\nTrump’s answers failed to convince Representative Mike Quigley, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.\nCan’t allow #Trump ’s bizarre rant to distract us from the real issues at hand. Need independent investigation into Trump-Russia connection.\n— Mike Quigley (@RepMikeQuigley) February 16, 2017 \nTrump Asks a Black Reporter if Black Lawmakers Are ‘Friends of Yours’ \nPressed by April Ryan, the Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks, to say if he intends to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus to discuss the problems of inner cities, Trump asked her to schedule a meeting. “Are they friends of yours?” he said.\nPresident Trump asks @AprilDRyan on @officialcbc : “Are they friends of yours?” pic.twitter.com/MkWD8Wx6pl \n— CSPAN (@cspan) February 16, 2017 \nA member of the group, Representative Gwen Moore, pointed out to Trump on Twitter that Ryan is “not your secretary.”\nHey @realDonaldTrump : @AprilDRyan is a honest & professional reporter. She’s not your secretary. @Reince knows @RepRichmond ‘s number. Use it\n— Gwen Moore (@RepGwenMoore) February 16, 2017 \n\nTrump Tells Reporter From Jewish Newspaper Asking About Anti-Semitic Attacks Is ‘Insulting’ \nWhen a reporter from a Jewish newspaper asked Trump how his government plans to respond to the recent uptick in anti-Semitic threats and attacks, he was careful to preface it by saying that he did not think the president or anyone on his staff was an anti-Semite.\nReporter specifically said he didn’t think Trump was anti-Semitic, yet Trump was still offended he asked for a plan to fight anti-Semitism pic.twitter.com/PpmI2EmbGw \n— Tommy Christopher (@tommyxtopher) February 16, 2017 \nDespite that, Trump cut the questioner off, ordering him to sit down and “be quiet,” and then responded as if he was being accused of being an anti-Semite. He called that allegation, which was specifically not made, “unfair,” citing his long friendship with Israel’s prime minister — “Betinyahu” — as proof that he was “the least anti-Semitic person.”\n“So you should take that,” Trump concluded, “instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question.”\nOne viewer, Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida, pointed out the question was more than fair.\n60 bomb threats against Jewish Centers in 27 states. Oh, it’s fair. https://t.co/hppIW0RWKy \n— Rep. Ted Deutch (@RepTedDeutch) February 16, 2017 \nTrump Suggests He Would Blow Up Russian Ship, but Fears ‘Nuclear Holocaust’ \nWhile making the case that he could be tough with Russia, Trump suggested, bizarrely, that Americans would cheer if he blew up a Russian ship off the coast of the United States, in international waters.\nTrump discusses Russian spy ship spotted off CT coast: “If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing” https://t.co/XTUOKhV3an pic.twitter.com/JAj5amqrCQ \n— CNN (@CNN) February 16, 2017 \n\nHe then suggested that what held him back from doing so was two things: a desire to “do a deal with Russia” — on what, he did not say — and the fact that a “nuclear holocaust” would be bad.\n… today, the president of the united states brought up “nuclear holocaust” at a press conference getting global coverage. #thisisnotnormal pic.twitter.com/ywlh11fEo2 \n— nick ramsey (@nick_ramsey) February 16, 2017 \nFact-Checked on False Claim, Trump Takes No Responsibility \nPeter Alexander, an NBC correspondent, pointed out to Trump that his claim to have won the biggest electoral margin since Ronald Reagan was patently false, given that both Barack Obama and George H.W. Bush eclipsed his total. Trump objected, “I was given that information, I don’t know.”\nThis needs to happen on EVERY lie. It’s up to the press to do this EVERY time. Go hard, y’all. On EVERY lie. pic.twitter.com/TGbishcDRj \n— Ava DuVernay (@ava) February 16, 2017 \nWhen Alexander went on to ask why Americans should trust him more than the news media when he is providing false information, Trump responded simply: “Well, I don’t know, I was given that information — actually I’ve seen that information around.”\nThe Leaks Are Real, but the News Is Fake, Trump Says \nIn a pair of bizarre exchanges, Trump was asked by both Jonathan Karl of ABC News and Jim Acosta of CNN if he could explain the logical contradiction between his claim that reports based on leaks from inside the government are fake and his anger about those same leaks.\n“The leaks are absolutely real, the news is fake because so much of the news is fake.” – President Trump to @jonkarl pic.twitter.com/WuExjt2uuW \n— Good Morning America (@GMA) February 16, 2017 \n“Is it fake news, or are these real leaks?” Karl asked.\nApparently not recognizing the illogic, Trump replied, “The leaks are absolutely real, the news is fake.”\n“[You said] the leaks are real, but the news is fake… I don’t understand,” reporter asks Pres.
