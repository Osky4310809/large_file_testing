Why marrying millennials are giving the finger to diamond rings Read more \nThe large stone was discovered by Emmanuel Momoh, one of thousands who work in the informal mining sector dominating the diamond-rich Kono region, the government said. \nThe government plans to hold a transparent auction for the gem in a country once tainted by so-called blood diamonds”. \n“A 706-carat diamond was presented to President Dr Ernest Bai Koroma yesterday evening,” the president’s office said on Thursday. “Receiving the diamond, President Koroma thanked the chief and his people for not smuggling the diamond out of the country,” it added, referring to the Tankoro chiefdom where Momoh uncovered the gem. \nIt will be sold in Sierra Leone with a “transparent bidding process to the benefit of the community and country, the government said. The uncut Cullinan stone weighed 3,106 carats.

He died in jail in September before he could stand trial. \nThe death toll from the civil war is estimated at 120,000, making it one of Africa’s deadliest conflicts in recent history. \nThe government has attempted to crack down on cross-border diamond trafficking to persuade foreign investors that blood diamonds are a thing of the past. \nThe diamond presented on Thursday, once confirmed by experts, is expected to rank among the largest. A 1,111-carat diamond was discovered at a mine in Botswana in 2015, the biggest find for more than a century. \nThat gem is second in size only to the Cullinan diamond, which was unearthed in South Africa in 1905. It weighed 3,106 carats uncut, according to the Cape Town Diamond Museum. \nThe Cullinan was cut into several gems, including two set into the sceptre and crown of the British crown jewels.
