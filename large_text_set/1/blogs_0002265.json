In their first year back, they finished the season 4-12, fired Jeff Fisher during the season, and had the NFL’s worst offense.\nIf all of that wasn’t frustrating enough for everybody in the organization, tight end Lance Kendricks had his season end with a costly missed opportunity:\nThe agony of incentives: Rams TE Lance Kendricks needed 500 yards to earn a $250,000 incentive this year. He finished with 499.\n— Field Yates (@FieldYates) January 2, 2017 That’s right, a single yard cost Kendricks a chance at $250,000. The Rams played the Cardinals this past Sunday, where Kendricks came into the game with 487 yards. He had two receptions for 12 yards on the afternoon. Twice this season, he didn’t have a single yard. Once against the Bucs, and the other against the Jets.\nKendricks signed his deal when the team was still in St. Louis back in March of 2015, for four years and $18.5 million, according to ESPN . The contract came with $10 million in guaranteed money, with an average annual salary of $4,625,000.\nThe contract has $1.75 million in incentives, including the 500-yard bonus. Kendricks would also get $150,000 if he made the Pro Bowl (he didn’t). He did have the second best year of his career, with the first coming back in 2012 when he had 519 yards receiving and four touchdowns.\nYes, there’s definitely plenty of other money that Kendricks isn’t missing out on, but $250,000 is still $250,000.\nNot everyone can be as fortunate as Sen’Derrick Marks, who got the sack he needed for a $600,000 bonus on the last play of the Jaguars season back in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T02:34:16.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
