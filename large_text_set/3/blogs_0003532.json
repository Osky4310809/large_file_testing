I'm always just kind of quietly stunned.\" \nDan Stevens, who plays the Beast in their upcoming movie, asked her what people were saying about her, to which Emma replied: \"They were saying that I couldn't be a feminist and... and have boobs.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T12:20:59.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
