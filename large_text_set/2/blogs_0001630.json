How falcons get first-class airline treatment \nThis viral picture of VIP birds of prey en route to Saudi Arabia came as no surprise to Bryn Close, breeder to the sheikhs Carrion baggage: 80 falcon hawks on a flight to Jeddah. Photograph: Ahmet Yasar View more sharing options   15.24 GMT Last modified on   15.26 GMT \nB ryn Close was not surprised by the picture flying around the web this week showing 80 falcons on an airline flight to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia . The birds of prey sit on boxes on the middle-row seats, apparently ignoring the safety talk. “To me that’s totally normal, we do it all the time,” he says from a Doncaster industrial estate, where he breeds the fastest birds in the world . “But when we do it they normally send a private jet over here to pick them up.” \nThere is big money in falcons, nearly all of it circling around the deserts outside Middle Eastern cities. For centuries, tribesmen in the region used the birds to hunt. Today, as cities including Jeddah as well as Dubai and Abu Dhabi have exploded, falcons have become economic as well as cultural status symbols. \n“It’s all part of a massive heritage,” says Close, who exports about 200 young birds a year to Middle Eastern clients including Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum , the billionaire crown prince of Dubai. The prince, 34, is also a keen horseman, fisherman, skydiver and car collector. \nToday, the birds have exhausted their prey around the cities, and lavish hunting trips to wilder grounds in Pakistan, Iran and Morocco are popular. “But then they started getting kidnapped and it was costing them millions in ransoms,” Close says. In 2015, 100 armed men kidnapped 26 Qatari hunters in Iraq , including members of the ruling family. \nFalcon racing has exploded as a safer, local pursuit. Close has just returned from the President’s Cup in Abu Dhabi. The president himself is another client. In 2014, the top seven winning birds in the title race came from Close’s farm. “They gave me a Rolex and a Range Rover for my efforts,” he says. “I sold the Range Rover out there because it was left-hand drive.” \nClose delivers his birds while they are young in padded travel boxes. Airlines in the region are equipped to carry them between races. Qatar Airways allows six falcons in the economy cabin per flight , for an excess baggage fee of up to $630 (£500) per bird. The airline would not comment on how many avian passengers it carries. \nClose, a former shop fitter from an impoverished background in Newcastle upon Tyne, sleeps in a caravan for half the year while he tends to his beloved birds. But life has been good since he started breeding 17 years ago. He prefers not to talk prices, but it is fair to say his revenues are in the millions. “I have to pinch myself sometimes,” he says. “When I first went to Abu Dhabi I was staying on a mattress on the floor in a converted greenhouse. This year, I was picked up in a gold Rolls-Royce and taken to the presidential suite at the Emirates Palace hotel.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:38:45.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
