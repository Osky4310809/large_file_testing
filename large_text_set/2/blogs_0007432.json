King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 12 hours ago 9 \nDream Theater's John Petrucci talked about what learning to play songs on guitar was like before the internet made instructional videos and tabs widely available. \nThe guitarist told Cosmo Music : \"I remember when Yngwie came on the scene and he had that solo with Steeler [Malmsteen's early band only active in 1983] - just unaccompanied. When I heard that for the first time I was like, 'What the fuck?!'\" \nExplaining how he was absolutely blown away by the fact that Yngwie was \"this 18-19-year-old kid from Sweden with long hair and ripped jeans\" and not someone looking like Al Di Meola or Paco De Lucia, John added: \n\"I remember just trying to learn all of those riffs. Slowing it down, putting the record on, putting it on the slower speed so it was like an octave lower. \n\"No tab back then! My friend had a cassette player that had a variable speed thing and I literally sat there and learned every one of those riffs - just practice them over and over and over and over. I did that with Di Meola and Allan Holdsworth.\"Because you can't see the person play, it wasn't like YouTube. When you're young and you're listening to this, you don't even know what you're listening to. Let's say you have delay on and you hear these kind of ghost notes and you're like, 'What the f... How do you play that?!' \n\"I remember listening to Boston and trying to learn how to harmonize solos and literally not knowing how to do that - my guitar just doesn't sound like that no matter what I do... Hearing ' Eruption ' for the first time, and he does the hammer-on part and it's phaser on it and the delay - it didn't sound like guitar to me, I couldn't comprehend how that was a guitar. \n\"And now kids are getting really, really good at a really young age because they can see how all of this is done. Just look it up, 'Oh, that's how you're doing it.' But back then, you just literally did not know what the technique was and you had to discover it. \n\"There was a lot of listening over and over and over. And hearing like Satriani do some crazy whammy bar thing and going, 'How is that a guitar?! The note is way too high, it's a spaceship! My guitar can't do that!'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:49:30.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
