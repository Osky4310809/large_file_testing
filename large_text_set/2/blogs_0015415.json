Late last Friday, news broke that Cloverfield , Let Me In , and Planet of the Apes director Matt Reeves was in negotiations to direct Warner Bros. Pictures’ upcoming Batman movie. Now, The Hollywood Reporter says those Batman negotiations have broken down. \nAccording to the trade, Reeves has exited the talks, though the studio is intent on making the movie no matter what. They do add that talks could possibly resume “when heads cool.” Prior to Reeves receiving the offer, Ridley Scott and Fede Alvarez were among the names on the shortlist. \nBen Affleck was originally attached to direct, but he decided to concentrate on acting in the film. \n“There are certain characters who hold a special place in the hearts of millions,” Affleck wrote in his recent statement. “Performing this role demands focus, passion and the very best performance I can give. It has become clear that I cannot do both jobs to the level they require. Together with the studio, I have decided to find a partner in a director who will collaborate with me on this massive film. I am still in this, and we are making it, but we are currently looking for a director. I remain extremely committed to this project, and look forward to bringing this to life for fans around the world.” \nWarner Bros. Pictures then added: “Warner Bros. fully supports Ben Affleck’s decision and remains committed to working with him to bring a standalone Batman picture to life.” \nIn The Batman , Affleck will face off against Joe Manganiello , who will play Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke, in the film. Additional appearances by Jeremy Irons as Alfred and J.K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon are expected to happen as well. \nAn official release date for The Batman , written by Affleck and Geoff Johns , hasn’t been set. Affleck will next appear as Batman in Justice League , opening in theaters on November 17. You can view photos from that film in the gallery below. \n(Photo Credit: Photo by Fotonoticias / FilmMagic / GETTY Images)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:55:38.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
