Your curiosity piqued? Evidently Jimmy Kimmel ‘s was, so he decided to meet up with the guy who “acquired” this rather expensive snack.\nUpon being tracked down in Los Angeles, Jimmy paid a visit to the man’s law office. What happens next is rather hilarious, as Kimmel decides to sucker punch the poor guy and then eat his $100k Harambe Cheeto. Is nothing sacred?!\nClearly, this is just a spoof, but press play above for a good laugh.\nFor reference, the individual who bid nearly $100,000 USD on the Cheeto has since backed out of the bid.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:57:08.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
