Hell hath no fury like a Bachelor mom scorned! Bachelor contestant Corinne Olympios has been rapidly making headlines since the premiere of Nick Viall 's season due to her promiscuous behavior and outlandish comments. (Like putting whipped cream on her breasts and proudly telling the cameras: \"My heart is gold, but my vagine is platinum.\") But now, Corinne's 's mom, Peri Olympios , is coming to her daughter's defense and clearing up some rumors -- and only ET has the exclusive quotes! PHOTOS: Spoiler Alert? 'Bachelor' Villain Corinne Spotted With a Ring on THAT Finger -- What Does It Mean? Over the weekend, Corinne was spotted on Instagram rocking a very sparkly ring on that finger, but according to her mom, she's definitely not engaged. \"It was the comedian's ring,\" Peri tells ET, referring to social media personality , Claudia Oshry , who is seen smiling next to Corinne. \"They did it as a spoof! Actually, it's the comedian who's engaged. It's Claudia's ring. They wanted to do a little skit thing. A spoof.\" While the rumors of Corinne's engagement are fake, Peri says that the social media bullying her daughter has been enduring over the past few weeks is very real. \"Corinne is a very smart, bright, wonderful girl who is larger than life -- kind of like me -- and so I was just saying things to protect her when they were calling her a 'slut' and a 'whore,' because she's not.\" \"The show is great and enhanced her personality,\" Peri adds. \"So, you know, that's why people were saying what they were saying when they were saying she's a little promiscuous. As a mother, I'm going to protect my daughter.\" WATCH: 'Bachelor' Nick Viall Admits He Was 'Uncomfortable' When Corinne Took Her Top Off Peri, who thinks that Corinne's time on The Bachelor will be a \"wonderful thing\" for her career, saying that she's already seen her daughter gain some devoted fans. \"There are some bad things, but then there are a lot of people who run up to her and think she's the greatest thing. I'm a huge fan of how she handled herself,\" she shares. Fans were sent into a frenzy during last week's episode when the 24-year-old Miami native confessed to her fellow contestants that she still has a nanny named Raquel who cooks, cleans and takes care of her. In fact, one Bachelor fan, Mark Chandley, created a GoFundMe page to raise money to \"#FreeRaquel.\" Corinne subsequently took to her own Instagram page last week to fire back at the fans writing, \"This is not a joke anymore someone took this way too far and is trying to make money for themselves. Raquel is not a slave and my family and I treat her like part of the family. Leave it alone already it's getting old. Grow up. #raquelisfree #celebnanny.\" While Peri does not deny that her daughter is still coddled by the nanny, she is quick to stress that Raquel is an integral part of the Olympios family. \"What had happened was we were getting a lot of calls [at our business from fans] and then people were saying we were abusing [our nanny] Raquel,\" Peri explains. \"As a mother, I'm going to protect my daughter and of course somebody who's been with me for 17 years.\" WATCH: 'Bachelor' Villain Corinne Fires Back at GoFundMe Account Made to 'Free' Her Nanny: 'This Is Not a Joke' \"The woman was with me while I survived cancer,\" Peri continues. \"Believe me, this woman could do no wrong. She can have anything she wants and she's a part of our family.\" As for Corinne's label as this season's Bachelor \"villain,\" Peri stresses that her daughter \"doesn't have a mean bone\" in her body. \"The show is great and enhanced her personality,\" she says. \"The winner and the few that stick out with their large personalities are the ones that get remembered.\" \"[Corinne] wanted to do this, and she went out and did it as elegantly as she did,\" Peri notes. \"She is very happy with the outcome, the people, everything.\" The Bachelor airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.
