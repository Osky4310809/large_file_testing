The police reacted as they do in any situation where they get assaulted first. This [is the] PNG reality where cops are outnumbered.” Iranian refugees on Manus allegedly assaulted by PNG police Read more \nKnight told Guardian Australia: “We cannot compare Australian and PNG police standards. This is PNG and the reality of keeping peace here with a small force is they have to be brutal. I would add that their [the refugees] injuries are what locals also get when assaulting police and acting like this. Only locals don’t get bail.” \nKnight said the police were sober and professional. \nThe men and other refugees on the island vehemently dispute Knight’s version of events, and say it was the immigration officers and police who were drunk, and who aggressively told them they were not allowed to be outside the detention centre at night. \n“The refugees said the first to attack them were two PNG immigration officers who were drunk and came to them and said ‘you don’t have the right to be outside of the prison at this moment’,” a fellow refugee told Guardian Australia. \n“After a few minutes the police joined them and beat them extremely badly in the head, face, back and hands.” \nThe men suffered serious injuries, including suspected fractures, facial wounds and internal injuries. Pictures show the men with wounds to their faces, backs and limbs. \nThe two men, whose first names are Mehdi and Mohammad, spent 36 hours in police custody before being bailed on payment of 200 kina ($A100) on charges of drunkenness and resisting arrest. \nThe New Year’s Eve incident is the latest to involve clashes between locals and refugees on the island. \nKnight has repeatedly said security inside the immigration detention centre had deteriorated so badly that the compounds were dangerous and lawless. He has posted online pictures of weapons and home-brew alcohol allegedly seized from inside the centre.
