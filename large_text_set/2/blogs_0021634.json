That could include people arrested for shop lifting or minor traffic offenses.\nThe DHS memos eliminate far more narrow guidance issued under the Obama administration that focused resources strictly on immigrants who had been convicted of serious crimes, threats to national security and recent border crossers.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio fired back Tuesday night, saying “the president has chosen the politics of division over our nation’s safety.”\n“We have been clear from the start that we will work with federal immigration authorities to remove individuals who are proven public safety threats in our City. What we will not do is turn our NYPD officers into immigration agents – or our jails into holding pens for deportation policy that will only undermine the inclusiveness that has helped make New York City the safest big city in the nation,” his statement read in part.\nThe DHS memos do not change U.S. immigration laws, but take a far harder line toward enforcement.\n(© Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
