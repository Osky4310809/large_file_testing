Sharah (l) partied on the yacht (Photo: Instagram/kaysha_louise) \nThe model shared the rant in a scathing message comparing both his and Mark Wahlberg's Calvin Klein campaigns. \nSharah wrote: \"Bieber looks like [he] just left church [and] stuck some transfer tats on to compensate [for] his small d**k and glorious 12-year-old body!\" \nIt was posted in 2015 - but it's not likely she'd be invited back if Bieber finds out about the post. She criticised his Calvin Klein ad (Photo: justinbieber/instagram) Don't listen to her, Justin (Photo: ChinaFotoPress via Getty) \nHis father Jeremy tweeted: \"@justinbieber what do you feed that thing. #proud daddy (sic)\" He's been defended by fans, friends and even family in the past (Photo: Splash) \nHis personal-trainer Patrick Nilsson also previously claimed Justin was \"well-endowed\" despite reports his Calvin Klein underwear campaign had been photoshopped to give him a bigger package. \nHe said: \"I can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy. I sound weird saying that, but yes.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:54:06.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
