At the same event, Koh Dong-jin, chief of Samsung Mobile said that the long-awaited Galaxy S8 flagship will be launched later than expected. The phone is delayed because the brand has pledged to enhance product safety following an investigation into the cause of fires in the Galaxy Note7 flagship.

Koh added that procedures had been put in place to avoid a repeat of the Galaxy Note7-like fires as the brand prepares the launch of the Galaxy S8. \n“The lessons of this incident are deeply reflected in our culture and process,” Koh told reporters at the press briefing. “Samsung Electronics will be working hard to regain consumer trust.” \nEarlier reports had suggested that the Samsung Galaxy S8 would be unveiled at an event on March 29th. The rumour mill also suggests that the phone will be available starting at $849, which is roughly Rs 58,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T14:17:11.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
