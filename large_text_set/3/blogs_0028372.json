By: FE Online | New Delhi   1:53 PM Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu addressing the party workers in New Delhi. (Source: BJP) \nUnion Minister Venakiah Naidu was at his aggressive best while speaking at the BJP convention in New Delhi on Saturday afternoon ahead of the 2017 MC polls. He attacked Congress by saying that it is a sinking ship nobody wants to step on. Naidu used the examples of Goa and Manipur assembly elections where Congress failed to form the government despite being the single largest party. He hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi by saying that he is ‘messiah of the poor’ and has changed the fortunes of the country. \n“Congress is a sinking ship, nobody wants to step on while Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the ‘messiah of the poor’. He is a 3-in-1 man and there is no one who can compete with him,” said Naidu who is currently serving as the Minister of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation and Information and Broadcasting in the Modi ministry. He further added that “Bharatiya Janata Party is the largest party in the world. India is one nation, one people, one country and that is the ideology of BJP which has made it popular in the country. \nWatch the full convention here: \nAbout 65,000 party workers attended the convention along with senior leaders like BJP President Amit Shah and BJP Delhi unit Chief Manoj Tiwari. Amit Shah took on the Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal during his speech. “I saw Arvind Kejriwal’s press conference before coming here. He said BJP promised loans waiver for farmers. We haven’t even finished one week in UP and he is already asking for our report card. What about his promises of making 20 new Universities, Unified Transport Authority, women security etc,” asked Shah. \nHe added that BJP’s aim is not just to win this year’s MCD election but also to lay a stronger foundation for the 2019 Lok Sabha election. “We had promised economic development of the country and today India is the fastest growing economy in the world. PM Modi promised electricity in villages and 16,000 new villages have electricity in last three years. BJP has introduced so many new initiatives like Digital India , Make in India etc. We have fulfilled all our promises. Delhi is India’s heart but there is a white spot there. We are not contesting these elections to win but to lay a foundation for the next Lok Sabha election,” he added.
