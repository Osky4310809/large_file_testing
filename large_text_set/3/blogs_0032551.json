By Gaurang Chauhan | Published: March 31, 2017 10:35 am When Badlapur actor Varun Dhawan forgot all about his 'badla' on meeting Sachin Tendulkar! \nFew days ago an image that showed two gentlemen, one holding a bat and another a mic, standing facing backwards. In no time the image went viral and people started speculating about the identity of the duo, which was an easy task as the two legends in the pic were Sonu Nigam and Sachin Tendulkar. The difficult task however was to speculate, as to what they have in store for us. Many thought this might be related to Sachin’s film but they were wrong. Turns out, the collaboration was for a song for Sachin’s newly launched app, ‘100 MB’. Where 100 probably signifies his record of 100 centuries and MB for Master Blaster, as he was fondly called by many. \nTalking at the launch of his app, he said, “I’m a shy person by nature. It takes some time to change. That doesn’t mean I will not come out and talk. I’m still figuring out.” He further revealed as to what prompted him for launching this app, he said, “Being a private person, I was not comfortable initially. Now, through tweets, I am able to read what others have posted. Sometimes, it brings smiles on your lips and I have felt ‘Wow, I wish I could meet this person’.” Also read: Am I seeing Sachin Tendulkar holding a mike and Sonu Nigam wielding a bat in this mystery pic? \nThe app will help his fans, followers and devotees to get to know their idol closely and vice-versa. Talking about that aspect of the app he said, “This is something I am looking forward to in the digital world, to be closer to my fans. This app will guarantee that whatever I say reaches my fans. Through this app, my fans can directly connect with me. My views, whatever I post, are guaranteed of reaching all my fans. Whatever I am today is because of the fans. Whatever my videos, opinions, posts will reach my fans.” \nTalking about his singing stint with Sonu Nigam, he said, “I have always been fond of music. I never thought I would sing a song. My wife (Anjali) is the brain behind me singing this song. It was her idea. She was the only one who believed I could sing.” \nCheck out Sachin’s tweet below: \n— sachin tendulkar (@sachin_rt) March 30, 2017 \nLater while talking to DNA, he mentioned that he didn’t practice much before going behind the mic, “I did not practice much. It was just then and there that I sang. I heard the tune. I quite liked it. After that, I was asked to practice a little bit, which I did in the studio. Before that, I had not practiced much. It helped, I was used to listening to music and humming songs. It helped.” Also read: Sachin Tendulkar’s biopic – Sachin: A Billion Dreams to release on May 26, 2017 \nHe sang alongside Sonu Nigam and revealed how it was a special experience, he said. “His commitment, his preparation, he worships music, that means a lot. Any passionate person does that. For us, it is cricket. For him, it is music. You ask anybody who has been top in his profession, he will be is passionate. It does not come on its own. It requires preparation.” \nHe however mentioned that he has no specific interest in music. Talking about his choice of music he said “I have heard different songs at different phases. I have listened to even Spanish songs, not knowing a single word. Hindi, Rockband, you name it. Music helps control emotions. It helps while going out to bat. It helps me unwind after a day’s play. It depends at that moment what I want to listen.” \nThrough the song, Tendulkar has also thanked all the players who has been part of his 24-year international journey including six World Cups.
