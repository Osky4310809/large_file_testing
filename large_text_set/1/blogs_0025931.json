Thousands of new Israeli homes in both East Jerusalem and the West Bank have been announced in the week since US President Donald Trump took office EPA \nIsrael has approved another 153 settler homes in occupied East Jerusalem and planning building permits for another 11,000 buildings, the city’s deputy mayor has said. \nThe vast expansion in building over the 1967 Green Line - viewed as illegal by the international community - comes after the announcement of thousands more homes in East Jerusalem and the West Bank in the last week. \nThe bold new policy approach has come into effect since US President Donald Trump - who is sympathetic to Israeli interests - took office last week.

Mr Obama’s administration was critical of Israeli settlements, warning that such construction was chipping away at hopes for a two-state solution. \nThe additional 153 buildings, will be located in Gilo, an established settlement neighbourhood. The move comes after 566 new settler housing units were announced last Sunday. \nSeparately, Israel’s Defence Ministry announced on Monday a planned 2,500 homes in the West Bank. \nBoth the United Nations and the European Union condemned the accelerated settlement expansion initiatives earlier this week. \nThe Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has demanded international action on the major expansions, saying in a statement it believed the Israeli moves came as a result of “what they consider encouragement by American President Donald Trump.” \nThe incoming Trump administration has struck a much less critical tone towards Israel than his predecessor.
