Called the Concept X, the car is not specifically meant to preview any upcoming model; rather, it is merely supposed to be a demonstration of the in-house design team’s skills. \nTaking the form of an MPV (with similar proportions to the Alza ), it’s certainly a very attractive design, even though it carries all the typical concept car cues such as slit-like headlights, large wheels hiding Brembo-branded disc brakes, a massive panoramic roof, flush door handles, a minimalist interior and the lack of any B-pillars or door mirrors. \nAt the front, there’s a slimline grille linking the headlights, with the Perodua badge mounted separately below. The bumper has an aggressive design with honeycomb-motif air intakes, while the sides feature a stepped window line and a character line that droops past the front wheels before rising up to meet the tail lights. \nMoving rearward, the rear wheel arches are blown to provide added muscle, and the D-pillars are blacked out to provide a floating roof look. The tail lights are angular and C-shaped (much like Subaru’s newer concepts), linked by a red bar. The rear bumper design mirrors that of the front. \nInside, there’s a driver-oriented, cockpit-like dashboard, as well as doors with a red colour scheme that links to the deep crimson exterior. There are six seats, but the rearmost pews are folded; the rest of the seats are sporty individual buckets with headrest-mounted monitors. \nAs mentioned, Perodua personnel present at the event say that the car does not preview any forthcoming model, but seeing as the Alza is due for a replacement, the next-generation model could incorporate a few cues present here. In fact, Daihatsu has already showcased a number of Ultra Function Compact (UFC) concepts that are supposed to preview an Alza-sized MPV, so this car could be Perodua’s own version. \nThe company has been steadily increasing its input in the design and engineering of its Daihatsu-based vehicles; last year’s Bezza sedan was its first car to feature an upper body designed completely in house. Perodua has also embarked on a five-year Transformation 2.0 plan this year, with one of the pillars being an increase in its research and development capabilities.
