Besides being the most vocal progressives around, they are all clueless about the America they claim to love. \nAnybody who’s anybody knows that our American flag should never touch the ground. It may not seem like a big deal in the Hollywood bubble, but it’s serious enough to be a part of the U.S. Code, Title 4, Chapter 1, Section 8 on “Respect for the flag:” \nThe flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise. \nWhy? Because brave men and women have spilled their blood to protect the freedoms it stands for and allowing it to touch the ground is a show of disrespect to their sacrifices. But these progressive pinheads didn’t just allow the flag to touch the floor for their cover shoot for Variety , they grabbed it, draped it across their bodies, and let the bottom puddle on the floor. Pathetic. \nThese are the same people who constantly lecture flyover country on what real patriotism looks like: abortion, communism, same-sex marriage, man-made climate change, etc. But they are clueless as to why they even have the freedoms to say such asinine things. \nThis cover should be changed and every copy destroyed: It’s disgusting that @Variety would publish a cover with our Flag touching the ground! Demand it be changed! \n— Bikers 4 Liberty (@Bikers4Liberty) January 17, 2017 \n\nThese people pretend to be patriots, but they’re far from that classification. This picture is all the proof needed. \nVariety should be ashamed they published this disgusting and disrespectful photograph.
