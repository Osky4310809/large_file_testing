The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that British actor has joined season two of The Crown , Netflix's Golden Globe-winning series about the rule of Queen Elizabeth II. He'll play Antony Armstrong-Jones, better known as Lord Snowdon, the society photographer who was married to Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) from 1960 until 1978. The couple, who had two children together, divorced after 18 years of marriage. Snowdon died earlier in January at the age of 86. The 10-episode drama created by Peter Morgan ( The Queen ) premiered to rave reviews in November 2016 and went on to pick up two Golden Globes in January: one for best drama and another for series star Claire Foy, who plays the Queen. The plan is for the show to follow her Royal Highness through the years, up until present time. \"The idea is to do this over six decades, in six seasons presumably, and make the whole show over eight to 10 years,\" Netflix chief Ted Sarandos said on a panel last Nov. Along with producer Sony Pictures Television, Netflix will find new actors to play the main characters at different stages of their lives. Season two is currently in production. For his part, Goode is also set as the lead in WGN America's sci-fi pilot Roadside Picnic , based on the 1972 novel of the same name by Arkady and Boris Strugatskys. Previously, he's had parts in A+E's Roots reboot and the fifth and sixth seasons of CBS' The Good Wife , which has since ended. His film credits include Allied , The Imitation Gam e, Watchmen and Match Point . Goode is repped by CAA, and Dalzell and Beresford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:11:57.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
