Top Rank promoter Bob Arum, who used to represent Mayweather, explained how the mixed martial arts organization is expecting too much of the purse. \"I think the only impediment there is the UFC, because UFC doesn't treat fighters the same way that boxing promoters do,\" Arum said, per Tim Burke of Bloody Elbow. \"In other words, UFC fighters get so much less than boxers do. They proposed a deal to Conor that on his share of the purse, they take 50 percent. Now, give me a break.\" McGregor said on IFL TV this week that he and Mayweather are \"very close to inking\" the bout, per Damon Martin of Fox Sports. As is often the case with Mayweather fights, however, the holdup usually comes down to money, and who gets what percentage of it. The highly anticipated matchup between Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao was discussed for years before the two finally got together. Still, Arum believes Dana White and Co. are the reason the sides might not come to a deal this time. \"If that fight doesn't happen, the blame will only be on the UFC,\" he said. Mayweather retired with a 49-0 record, but he told fans he was coming out of retirement to face the Irish star. While McGregor has been a dominant force in MMA , he has no professional experience as a boxer.
