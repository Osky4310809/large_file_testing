Alastair Cook is England's highest runscorer in Test cricket England captain Alastair Cook will meet director of cricket Andrew Strauss on Friday, but no decision on his role as skipper is expected to be made. \nThe 32-year-old admitted to having \"questions\" over his position during the 4-0 series defeat in India. \nHe meets with Strauss to review each series England play and has maintained that it is in these meetings in which his future will be decided. \nAppointed in 2012, Cook has captained in an England record 59 Tests. \nSpeculation over how long he might remain as leader first arose before the tour of India, when Cook said he was looking forward to a time when he was no longer captain. \nThough England gained a creditable draw in the first Test, their performances deteriorated. \nIn the fourth Test they became only the third side to lose by an innings after making 400 or more batting first, a result that sealed a series defeat and after which Cook said he thought vice-captain Joe Root was \"ready\" to lead. \nThe fifth Test saw the tourists again beaten by an innings after hitting 477 batting first, this time with India piling on 759-7, their highest Test total and the largest made by any side against England. \nIn the aftermath, former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott called on Cook to step aside, while ex-captain Michael Vaughan said he expected the opener to stand down. \nIf Cook resigns, or is sacked, then Root, 26, is expected to take over.
