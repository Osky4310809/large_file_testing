The film is monumental for its sheer length (clocking in at just under eight hours) but also for its and scope. \nThe film centers on O.J. Simpson and the brutal double murder of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown, but it also shows in painstaking detail the racial politics circling around the trial: the racist history of the LAPD, the Rodney King beating, and the LA riots, and how they were inseparable from the not-guilty verdict that was eventually delivered. \nSo it’s only natural that Edelman, who is the son of Children’s Defense Fund founder Marian Wright Edelman, would pay equal tribute to Brown, Goldman, and the victims of police brutality. #Oscars : Ezra Edelman dedicates his award to the \"victims of police violence and police brutalities.\" pic.twitter.com/C8J3SUhVUK \n— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017 Story Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:02:29.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
