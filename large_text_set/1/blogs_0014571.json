Rec Shamus Clancy admits Jahlil Okafor jokes are a big part of his Twitter account. Still, his tweet on Saturday was relatively mild, all things considered. He didn’t expect this would be the one that would have Okafor’s dad trying to fight him. Here’s Chukwudi Okafor’s now-deleted response to Clancy, who is a writer at SB Nation’s 76ers blog Liberty Ballers. Clancy saw the tweet immediately and laughed, not expecting it to get much bigger than that. “I assumed it was something that people were going to hassle and poke fun at me for on Sixers Twitter, not thinking it was going to become something picked up on by national publications,” Clancy told SB Nation. But the tweet picked up momentum. Chukwudi and Clancy had never interacted on Twitter before, but Okafor’s father has been outspoken about his son. After the original tweet was deleted, the senior Okafor tweeted “I was hacked ” before also deleting that tweet. Okafor started on Saturday because Joel Embiid sat out for rest. The Wizards lost, 109-93, but Clancy referenced a two-hour bus ride because that’s exactly what 350 Sixers fans did, coming from Philadelphia to Washington D.C. for the game to support Embiid and the Sixers in a trip organized by a popular 76ers podcast and even supported by head coach Brett Brown , who donated $2,000 to help cover the costs.

With so many of those people being staunch defenders of Nerlens Noel in the never-ending Okafor vs. Noel debate, I thought it warranted mentioning since Sixers coach Brett Brown elected to start Okafor over Noel.” Clancy said neither Jahlil, nor Chukwudi Okafor, nor the Sixers reached out to him about the tweet. Still, I had to ask whether Clancy would accept Chukwudi’s offer. “What offer? He was hacked.” Next Up In NBA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T00:20:44.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
