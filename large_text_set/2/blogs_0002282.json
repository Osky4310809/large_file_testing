TMG breaks down some examples of Depp's alleged spending in the court documents, including $75 million to buy, improve and furnish 14 residences, including a 45-acre chateau in South France, a chain of islands in the Bahamas and a fully-functioning house farm in Kentucky, all which required a staff of employees to maintain the properties. The documents also claim Depp spent $18 million to buy and renovate a luxury yacht, $30,000 a month to have wines personally flown to him and millions to maintain his expensive art , guitar, jewelry and Hollywood memorabilia collections.

He is also asking for preliminary and permanent injunction on TMG's foreclosure of his four Sweetzer Trust & Mooh Investment Trust properties in Los Angeles.
