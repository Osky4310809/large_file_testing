But it will be visible to the naked eye after midnight where it will be closest to Earth.\nIt will pass by at a distance of 7.4 million miles – that’s 30 times further away than the moon.\nThe periodic comet was first spotted in 1948 and returns every five and a quarter years, and is marked out by a bright purple tail.\n(Picture: Met Office/PA) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:41:05.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
