The money will be shared between three charities supporting young refugees: Help Refugees , Safe Passage , and the Children’s Society . \nThe charities thanked readers for their generosity, saying the donations would make a huge difference to the lives of thousands of children, both those facing a bleak winter in the refugee camps, and those attempting to rebuild their lives in the UK. The charities supported by the Guardian and Observer 2016 appeal Read more \nThe charities provide a range of support, from supplying emergency aid to refugee camps to enabling unaccompanied refugee children to find legal sanctuary with relatives in the UK, and providing support to help youngsters adapt to life in Britain. \nMatthew Reed, the Children’s Society’s chief executive, said: “The generosity of the Guardian and Observer readers has been overwhelming. £1.75m is an incredible amount and we are extremely grateful for every single penny donated. The money raised will make a huge difference to the lives of the child and young refugees we work with, helping them to rebuild their lives here in the UK.” \nJosie Naughton, a co-founder of Help Refugees, said: “This morning thousands of refugee children woke up in tents in sub-zero temperatures across Europe. Help Refugees will ensure the generous donations from the Guardian readers go towards improving the lives of these very children. \n“Throughout the entire appeal we have been overwhelmed by the generosity and support we have received and want to thank everyone who donated, as well as the Guardian and Observer”. \nNeil Jameson, executive director of Citizens UK , which oversees Safe Passage, said: “We have been overwhelmed by the support of Guardian and Observer readers. We will be putting the funds raised to immediate use; as Greece sees refugees camping in sub-zero temperatures, our team are working hard to identify those who have a legal right to safe passage. \n“In the longer term, the funds will be used to open safe and legal routes to many more refugees, as well as supporting communities to build a welcoming environment here in the UK.” \nThe 2015 appeal , in support of six refugee charities, raised £2.6m. The previous highest amount raised was £1.4m in 2004 in the wake of the tsunami disaster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T16:03:51.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
