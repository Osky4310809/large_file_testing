Right from flagships from the stable of LG, Huawei and Sony to mid-rangers from the likes of Lenovo and Nokia – MWC 2017 had it all. But while we’re waiting for these phones to come our way, which are the phones consumers are searching for right now? To find that out, we dug deeper into the data based on the top phones searched by 91mobiles users in the month of February. Keep in mind that this list is based on smartphones available to buy in India, and just indicates consumer interest, but not necessarily the actual sales of the mentioned devices. The Top 5 \nWhile the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( review ) and vivo’s V5 Plus ( review ) continue to sit at the first and second spots respectively, the rest of the three positions in the top 5 seemed to have shuffled. Sitting on the third place, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4’s 3GB RAM has jumped nine spots compared to its popularity ranking in the month of January. The vivo V5 ( review ) has also risen one place to sit at the fourth position. The table-toppers just have devices from Xiaomi and vivo, as the fifth place is taken by the budget powerhouse, the Xiaomi Redmi 3s Prime ( review ). Complete list \nTalking about the entire list of top 20 mobile phones in the month of February, you won’t find many changes. Most of the devices have been able to maintain their popularity rrankings to remain in the chart, albeit with a drop in their rankings. Let’s take a closer look along with checking out the changes in their positions from January, their price bands and the month of launch in the subcontinent. Hits and misses Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro: 8th position \nSamsung’s latest offering for the Indian market offers flagship-level specs at an upper mid-range price, but that’s not the only thing worth highlighting about the Galaxy C9 Pro ( review ). It’s the first smartphone from Korean giant’s stable that features 6 gigs of RAM and a 16-megapixel camera at the front. It also takes phablet obession to the extreme with its large display panel measuring 6-inches, along with promising a long runtime with its 4,000mAh battery. Lenovo K6 Power: 9th position \nLenovo’s K6 Power is one of the best compact smartphones one can buy priced under Rs 10,000, and that’s why we aren’t surprised to see it find a place in the top 20 chart. The 5-incher comes powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 chipset, which is mated to 3GB of RAM. For imaging, it offers a pair of 13- and 8-megapixel cameras. OPPO A37: 20th position \nWhile most of the smartphones from OPPO are available in the mid-range, the A37 is the brand’s sub-Rs 10,000 offering. Being a budget device, it offers a 5-inch HD display and gets Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 410 along with 2GB RAM under the hood. Like all the handsets from company’s stable, the A37 focusses on camera capabilities as it flaunts an 8MP camera at the back and a 5MP front-facing shooter. Trend analysis Xiaomi and Lenovo end Samsung’s dream run \nOver the past few months, Samsung was able to maintain its top spot with the most number of popular devices featured in our monthly top 20 lists. However in the month of February, its dream run seems to have ended. Toppling it from first place is not one, but two brands – Xiaomi and Lenovo – with five most popular devices from each. Samsung has been relegated to the third position with four phones present in the list. \nInterestingly, we think the month of February saw the number of brands present in the list shrink, as usually around 10 companies are present with their phones listed in the top 20. Compact devices making a comeback \nWhile phablets seem to have taken over the market, compact phones are now making a comeback. Last month, out of 20 phones, only eight phones fell in the phablet category. What this means is that large-screened smartphones aren’t enjoying the same popularity as they used to, and consumers are valuing the one-hand experience more.
