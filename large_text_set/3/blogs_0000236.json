Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nHe was a recent Manila visitor as he was among the imports signed by the Mighty Sports team in its campaign in a recently held Dubai international tournament. \nThe Hotshots, aching to sustain their solid third-place showing in the all-Filipino tourney, are bringing in a new face in Mitchel, a 24-year-old 6-foot-8 forward selected at 37th overall by the Detroit Pistons in the 2013 NBA Draft. \nThe Milwaukee native was subsequently signed up by the Pistons with whom he played 21 games in the 2013-14 NBA season. \nWith North Texas in college play, Mitchel bagged the Sun Belt Freshman of the Year honors in 2012 while also making the All-Sun Belt First Team. He then gained All-Sun Selt Second Team citation the following year. \nLeft unsigned by the Hotshots, Bowles was picked by the Texters. \n“He wants to be with a winning team and he wants to win. That’s all he’s been saying,” said TNT team manager Virgil Villavicencio of Bowles, a champion import and Best Import winner for Star (then B-Meg) in the 2012 Commissioner’s Cup. \nThe 6-foot-10 center/forward, who split four years of college ball with Texas A&M and James Madison, has attended three shootout sessions with the Texters. Actual practice starts today. \nA concern for the team will be the absence of Jason Castro, RR Pogoy and Troy Rosario once they start to train with Gilas Pilipinas for the coming SEABA Championship. \nTNT is now looking around for somebody who can fill in Castro’s spot. Being considered is a possible trade deal for Rain or Shine’s Jericho Cruz. \n“There are now feelers (for trade), but it’s not yet in the drawing board. Coach Nash (Racela) is the one working on it,” said Villavicencio.
