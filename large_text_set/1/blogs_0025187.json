HSBC is shutting its branches the fastest, with 222 closures in 2016, and a further 56 to come this year. Read More Yorkshire and Clydesdale Bank announces 79 branch closures: Full list of places due to shut down this year \nHowever, the Post Office says through offering counter-based banking services, the impact of local branch closures on communities can be minimised. \nNick Kennett, chief executive of Post Office Financial Services, said: \"We are working with banks to ensure that our network of bricks and mortar locations gives consistent and widest possible availability of face-to-face banking services across the UK, with many customers already benefiting from this. \n\"Making banking services available through Post Offices better and more efficient will significantly improve overall ease of access, and ensure we are continuing to reach vulnerable customers and those in remote areas, who depend on it most.‚Äù \nBusiness minister Margot James said: \"Millions of consumers and small businesses across the UK will now benefit from unrivalled access to banking services, including on Sundays, thanks to the Post Office. \n\"This is the biggest expansion in branch banking services in a generation and I am delighted the network is able to offer these services to so many customers.\" How can I get involved? \nCustomers do not need to register to this scheme. If you bank with any of the firms listed above, you automatically qualify for this service. \nAll you have to do is visit your local branch with your personal banking details to get started.
