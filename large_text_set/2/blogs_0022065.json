Dalupang (philstar.com)   5:30pm From left: Japeth Aguilar, Jayjay Helterbrand, Solomon Mercado, and Mark Caguioa of Ginebra | Philstar Photo \nMANILA, Philippines — It seems there’s no stopping Ginebra’s famed tandem. \nFans of Jayjay Helterbrand and Mark Caguioa believed that the final chapters to their career arc have started to unfold after the Gin Kings’ duo added another PBA title to their collection. \nBut that may all change, as they are once again within striking distance of one more crown. \n“You should ask Jayjay right here,” Caguioa teased, during the PBA’s Philippine Cup Finals presser at Sambo Kojin restaurant in Eastwood, Quezon City on Wednesday. \n“Y’all want me retired?” Helterbrand chimed in with a chuckle. “I don’t know, man. We’re just going to keep playing hard as long as we can.” \nHaving won five championships together under the Ginebra banner, Helterbrand and Caguioa go way back. Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nOnce known as the “Bandana brothers” of the early 2000s, they went on to become the “Fast and the Furious”—a nod to the pop-culture tandem off the popular racing movie franchise. Both became All-Stars and snared the Most Valuable Player award, and at the same time, put themselves into the ranks of the club history’s most recognizable faces. \nNow, they’re just four wins away from further growing their legends. \nMark Caguioa (L) and Jayjay Helterbrand during the Finals series with Meralco in last year's season-ending Governors' Cup. | Philstar.com File/Jonathan Asuncion \n“Si coach [Alfrancis Chua] na lang mag-dedecide n’on,” Caguioa said in jest. \nBut he also made a strong case of their relevance: “Back-to-back kami sa Finals. Come on, man, ang hirap [kaya] n’on.” \nThe two cagers were pivotal in Ginebra’s title conquest in the 2016 Governors’ Cup, helping their squad outduel a pesky Meralco Bolts side. \n“Whatever happens, happens,” said the 40-year-old Helterbrand. “I’m just very happy to be here and to have another opportunity to get another championship.” \n“We’re excited to be back in the Finals again,” added the 37-year-old Caguioa. \nHelterbrand’s contract was renewed for a year last October, while his partner’s was extended for two more years a month after. \nAnd as the spotlight continue to beam at their partnership, Caguioa also went to add that their legacy’s continued run is all thanks to one man: Tim Cone. \n“Coach Tim he tells us that we are the magic,” he shared. “But I think siya talaga yung magic dito.” \n“He presses the right buttons—or he knows what kind of buttons to push—to make the players play the way they’re playing now,” Caguioa noted. \n“So it’s all thanks to him and all these guys who brought us to the finals,” he closed. \nThe Fast and the Furious will again refuse to be the past and the previous against defending conference champions San Miguel Beer in their Finals series which tips off at 7 p.m. Friday at the Mall of Asia Arena.
