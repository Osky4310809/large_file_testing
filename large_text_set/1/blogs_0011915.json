Kelly has put an end to rumors that he’s scheduled to perform at Donald Trump’s inauguration. \nKelz posted the following message on a bright yellow background (yes, yellow), and uploaded it to Instagram Thursday (January 12). \n“Despite the rumors circulating online, R. Kelly will not be performing at this years inauguration ceremony. Any reports stating otherwise are simply untrue.” A photo posted by R Kelly (@rkelly) on Jan 12, 2017 at 5:08pm PST \nJokes about R. Kelly performing at the inauguration quickly spread on social media this week, spurred by the combination of Trump and his team’s inability to book a marquee performer , and the release of an unverified dossier that alleged that Trump orchestrated a “golden shower” show with some prostitutes while in Moscow. (Kelly, as you most likely remember, was accused of urinating on an underage girl on video and was charged with child pornography. He was acquitted of the charges in 2008.) BREAKING: R. Kelly confirmed to perform at inauguration. \n— Jonathan Torrens (@TorrensJonathan) January 11, 2017 \nThe singer’s straight-forward message on Instagram comes as fellow artist Snoop Dogg threatened to offer a verbal lashing to anyone willing to perform at the president-elect’s inauguration. \n“So, ain’t nobody gonna perform for Donald Trump, huh? Which one of you jiggaboo-ass niggas gonna be the first one to do it? I’m waiting,” the Long Beach rapper said. “I’m gonna roast the fuck out of you Uncle Tom-ass niggas for doing it. Which one of you niggas gonna do it first?” \nDonald Trump’s inauguration is set to take place on Friday, January 20.
