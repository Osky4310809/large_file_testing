The Head-to-Knee Pose \nNow raise both hands over-head and gently ease the trunk and hand as far down as you can then return upright with hands still overhead and then go back down again. Do this for a couple more times to limber the back and hamstrings for the head to knee pose. In the final stage of the posture you form a ring with the fore-finger and thumb around the big toes with the forehead resting on the knees and the elbows touching the floor. \nIn the initial stages when it’s impossible to assume the full posture, it will do to hold as far down the legs as you can and lower the trunk as well. Stay in the position for as long as 10 seconds and eventually hit the target of two minutes in one stretch. \nIt …… to allow the circulation to stabilise and also get in a little rest. \nBenefits: \nThe head to knee pose tones up the muscles of the back, the arms and the hamstrings. The effect of “doubling up” lends a gentle massage to the digestive organs improving the way the body handles nourishment. \nIn the womenfolk, this pose is said to help painful periods and eventually stop it completely. It’s also a great exercise for long distance runners as the hamstrings are where the long distance runner is most likely to develop muscle pulls. \nPhysical benefits: \nPowerfully massages all the abdominal organs, \n* Stimulates and tones the digestive organs, increases peristalsis, and relieves constipation and other problems. \n* Counteracts obesity and enlargement of the spleen and liver. \n* Regulates the pancreatic function, providing a valuable aid for those with diabetes or hypogly-caemia. \n* Mobilises the joints and increases elasticity in the lumbar spine. \n* Relieves compression of the spine and sciatica. \n* Strengthens and stretches the hamstrings. \nMental benefits: \n* Greatly enhances concentration and mental endurance. \n* Invigorates the mind and nervous system, controlling many nervous complaints.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T13:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T08:34:17.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
