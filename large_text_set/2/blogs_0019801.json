Palanisami took charge. By: FE Online | Published: February 21, 2017 12:11 PM MK Stalin is reportedly scheduled to meet President Mukherjee on February 23rd. Sources: Reuters \nMK Stalin, DMK’s working president, is not sitting quietly after Tamil Nadu’s new chief minister E. Palanisami took charge. The DMK had moved the Madras High Court to declare the results of Saturday’s elections null and void. The latest update we have is that the DMK hearing has been postponed. Madras High Court will hear the plea tomorrow. Also, MK Stalin is reportedly scheduled to meet President Mukherjee on February 23rd. Not only has MK Stalin said that he wants to move a second no-confidence motion against him but he also termed the government as a ”proxy” that is being controlled by the convicted AIADMK general secretary Sasikala. \nQuestioning the legitimacy of the government formed by Palanisami, MK Stalin said that the party will seek an appointment with President Pranab Mukherjee and submit a report to understand. Stalin also questioned the legitimacy of the current state government and said that the party would be seeking an appointment with President Pranab Mukherjee. According to MK Stalin, the floor test was not legitimate for one simple reason – there was no Opposition. \nAlso Watch: \nGiven these fast-paced developments in Tamil Nadu politics, TTV Dinakaran, Sasikala’s nephew, visited her for over 40 minutes at the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison in Bengaluru yesterday. Their meeting is significant as it may point to the legal options and strategies they are planning with regard to Stalin moving the High Court. Now that we know the plea will be heard tomorrow by the Madras High Court, it is clear that the EPS camp will also be gearing up to explore various legal options and be ready with a political strategy to counter MK Stalin.
