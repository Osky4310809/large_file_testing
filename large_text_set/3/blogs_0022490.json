(AP) By Adam McCalvy and Chris Haft / MLB.com | + 0 COMMENTS \nPHOENIX -- Denard Span and Jae-gyun Hwang each hit a two-run home run, Hwang's a go-ahead shot during a three-run seventh inning, and the Giants beat the Brewers, 6-4, on Wednesday at Maryvale Baseball Park. \nBrewers starter Jimmy Nelson pitched effectively into the sixth inning and was in line for the win before the Giants rallied with two outs in the seventh against reliever Carlos Torres . Tim Federowicz doubled home a run to tie the game at 4, and Hwang followed with a homer to right field. Full Game Coverage \nMatt Cain , fighting for his spot in the San Francisco rotation, dealt with baserunners throughout a five-inning start in which he surrendered four earned runs on seven Brewers hits, with a walk and four strikeouts. The Brewers scored three of their runs off Cain in the first inning, when Ryan Braun doubled and Domingo Santana singled for back-to-back RBIs. The Brewers made it 3-0 on a steal of home, with Jesus Aguilar breaking from first base and Hernan Perez scoring from third on a delayed double steal. Perez slid home safely when second baseman Gordon Beckham 's throw sailed wide of the catcher. \nAguilar added another run in the fourth with a solo homer to center field, his fifth this spring, as the right-handed-hitting slugger bids for a spot on the Brewers' bench. \n\"Our offense has been here every single day,\" Nelson said. \"My last two starts, they got me 3-4 runs in the first inning both times. â€¦ I think the later it gets in Spring Training, the more you can [read into that]. The pitchers are trying to get more into game mode.\" \nNelson also praised the Brewers' defense after he allowed only two hits, including Span's two-run homer in the third. The other hit off Nelson was Aaron Hill 's two-out double in the sixth, which led to a run when Hunter Pence hit a soft double down the right-field line against reliever Nick Ramirez. \nIncluding his two-walk, four-strikeout performance Wednesday, Nelson has walked two batters and struck out 16 in 12 2/3 innings in Cactus League games. \n\"That was one of the main focuses, getting ahead of guys and having [fewer] baserunners on the stuff I can control,\" Nelson said. \"Pound the zone. There's going to be hits, but I'm making them earn it.\" \nBrewers center fielder Keon Broxton provided a light moment in the first inning when he stumbled around first base and slid face-first in the dirt. Broxton settled for a single and a hug from first-base coach Carlos Subero. \n\"I was laughing on the way down,\" Broxton said. \"I just accepted it, man.\" \nGiants Up Next: A potentially scintillating pitching matchup is in store for Thursday beginning at 6:05 p.m. PT on MLB.TV , as Giants left-hander Matt Moore opposes Mariners right-hander Felix Hernandez .
