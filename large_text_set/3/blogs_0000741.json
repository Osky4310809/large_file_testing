Sometimes they’re streetballers who take a special pride and pleasure in going out on the streets and embarrassing all comers with a spectacular array of flicks and tricks. \nAnd sometimes we get the cream of the crop. \nLittle kids with sauce. \n— SPORF (@Sporf) February 28, 2017 \nLook at the pure, casual nature of the nutmeg. The unbothered calm before the storm. The intricate but oh so smoothly executed footwork before little dude decides to teach his baby sister an early lesson in public humiliation. \nThe meg’s so clean, his sister doesn’t even know what’s happened until her pants nearly split. \nEverything about it is the highest levels of sauce, and it’s probably the best one we’ve seen this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:48:43.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
