Manson Gave Burton the Nickname ‘Star’ \nNicknamed “Star” by Manson, Burton has taken this to heart and has been calling herself that ever since. \nStar bears a resemblance to Manson Family member Susan Atkins, also known as Sexy Sadie, incarcerated for the role she played in the Tate-LaBianca murders. Star, however, has stated in a Rolling Stone interview , “That bitch was fucking crazy, she was a crazy fucking whore. ‘Oh Charlie, I did this for you.’ She didn’t know what she was doing.” \nIn the same interview with Rolling Stone, she claims she can prove she’s more devoted than any of the other girls, saying , “I’ll tell you straight up, Charlie and I are going to get married. When that will be, we don’t know. But I take it very seriously. Charlie is my husband. Charlie told me to tell you this. We haven’t told anybody about that.” This was in 2013. \nShe has also carved an X on her forehead in the same fashion females of the Manson Family cult had done in the past. 5. She Comes From a Deeply Religious Background \nBurton grew up near St. Louis in a devout Baptist family. According to her , Burton’s family locked her in her room and kept her from her friends during high school. Her father denies this . She says at this time, during her interview with Rolling Stone , “I was smoking marijuana, eating mushrooms, not wanting to go to church every Sunday.” It was during her high school years that a friend introduced her to Manson’s environmental writings and she initiated contact with him. When she moved to Corcoran at 19, Burton says she saved $2,000 to move there after working in a retirement home kitchen. \nIn an email with Daily Mail, Burton’s father Phil says , “We have not, we are not going to and we never will, no matter what she does in her life, disown our daughter. I love my kids more than life itself. I love my daughter, my wife loves my daughter and I know she still loves us.” \nHe also told the Daily Mail , regarding Burton’s claims about being locked away, “I’ve never in my life ever locked any of my kids in their rooms. I consider myself to be strict by today’s standards. But I honestly don’t know where all that stuff came from. Is it her perception? I don’t know.” \nStar’s relationship with her family is fairly positive , but her father has stated they will not attend the wedding or welcome Manson into their family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T06:03:04.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
