It’s everywhere tonight for a very good cause Many people turn to entertainment to escape the burdens of reality — the great droves which attended movies during the Great Depression illustrates just that — but at this point, can we expect politics and Hollywood to remain separate ? If this year’s Oscars red carpet is any indication, the answer is no. Many stars are taking to the red carpet with blue ribbons pinned to their couture gowns and bespoke tuxes. It turns out that the ribbons represent support for the organization’s “ Stand with the ACLU ” initiative.\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ruth Negga are among the stars sporting the ribbons, which make perfect sense: Miranda publicly shared his concerns with the Trump Administration’s potential threats to the country and Ruth Negga’s film for which she is nominated, Loving , is largely tied to the ACLU .\nJeff Kravitz/Getty Images According to People , the ACLU released a statement requesting Hollywood’s elite to wear the ribbon, for the rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution to everyone in the United States The ACLU recently published its “next endeavor,” which is to mobilize grassroots initiative and empower individuals to protect U.S. citizens’ basic freedoms in a time when they are being challenged.\nSupermodel, Karlie Kloss, also dawned the ribbon on her white gown, proving yet again that supermodels aren’t afraid of getting political when civil liberties are at stake.\nJeff Kravitz/Getty Images The ACLU has taken to Twitter to show their excitement over the Oscar attendees’ participation.\nYes, blue ribbons represent ACLU. Let us know who you spot wearing them! So far we've seen Ruth Negga and @Lin_Manuel ! #Oscars #Oscars2017 https://t.co/2Bo4giuJcT \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) February 26, 2017 Whether their wearing their ribbons in protest of Trump’s Islamophobic attempts to ban immigration from certain countries , his recent reversal of protection for trans students , or the intensified allowance of deportations , the Oscar red carpet is likely to be dabbled with blue. Props to all the stars who are taking a stand.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:14:21.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
