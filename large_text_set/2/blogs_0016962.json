We worked really well together the entire race. I’ll keep that in mind in the (Daytona) 500.” \nStewart-Haas Racing teammates Clint Bowyer and Kurt Busch finished second and third, respectively, behind Hamlin’s Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota, as Earnhardt faded to sixth on the last lap. \n“I don’t know what I could have done differently to defend that,” said Earnhardt, who led 53 of 60 laps. “… Ain’t much you can do about it. It’s not really defendable. Good job by Denny.” \n“Just super impressed with this team,” added Bowyer, who had a strong run in his first race with SHR. \nEarnhardt, who on Sunday qualified second for the Daytona 500, started the second Duel on the pole in his No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet. It was Earnhardt’s first race since last July, when he was sidelined by a concussion for the entire second half of the NASCAR season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:22:13.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
