Antonio Conte hopes there will be no repeat of the violence that marred the EFL Cup match between Chelsea and West Ham. \n\"Last time wasn't good,\" Conte said. \"I hope in this game our fans, the West Ham fans, enjoy totally the game and find the right atmosphere. In England, it's very strange for me to talk about this -- usually in every game you find the right atmosphere. \n\"The last game against West Ham there was an exception. But I hope, on Monday, to find a good atmosphere in the stadium. I think the players, the club, the country deserves this.\" \nWest Ham are one of only two teams to beat Chelsea since Conte's decision to switch to a 3-4-3 formation in late September, and he has primed his players for another difficult challenge as they bid to restore a 10-point lead at the top of the Premier League. \n\"This game against West Ham, for us, is very important,\" he added. \"In the last away game, the way we played against Burnley, we drew. They played very physical football against us. \n\"Maybe it can happen, the same, against West Ham on Monday. But for this reason we are preparing for this type of situation. It will be a really tough game.\" \nLiam is ESPN FC's Chelsea correspondent.
