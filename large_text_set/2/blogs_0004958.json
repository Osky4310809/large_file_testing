File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - The chief special prosecutor whom former president Benigno Aquino III sacked but was reinstated by the Court of Appeals (CA) will retire on March 11. \nAquino sacked Office of the Ombudsman chief special prosecutor Wendell Barreras-Sulit in 2013 for entering into a plea bargain agreement with retired military comptroller Maj. Gen. Carlos Garcia, who was facing a plunder charge. \nThe Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) yesterday announced that it would be entertaining applications and recommendations for the position to be vacated by Sulit. \nThe deadline for submission is on Feb. 28. The JBC shall deem the date of actual receipt of the applications and complete documentary requirements as the date of filing. \nGarcia, a graduate of Philippine Military Academy class 1971, was charged with plunder for having unexplained wealth, including millions of pesos and a condominium at Trump Plaza in New York. \nUnder the supervision of former ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez, Sulit entered into a plea bargain agreement with Garcia.   \nUnder the agreement, the plunder charge against Garcia was downgraded to direct bribery charges but Garcia should return P135,433,387.84 to the government. \nOn July 22, 2016, the CA Special 10th Division issued decision ordering the reinstatement of Sulit. \nThe CA ruled that Aquino and former executive secretary Paquito Ochoa Jr. made an error and usurped the authority of the courts when they dismissed Sulit. \nThe CA believed that the plea bargaining agreement was lawfully implemented because it was done under the supervision of Gutierrez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:29:11.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
