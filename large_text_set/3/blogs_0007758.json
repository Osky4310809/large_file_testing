Lance brought up hearings that took place in years past, but Hayes said he’s just talking about during this Congress so far. \nLance highlighted the committee’s 27-hour marathon session . Hayes countered that he means hearings with expert witnesses that can be brought in. With such significant legislation, he asked Lance if he really thinks those 27 hours are sufficient. \nSome Republicans have taken issue with the speed of the legislative process   Act, most notably Senator Tom Cotton , who said Thursday morning , “What matters in long run is better, more affordable health care for Americans, NOT House leaders’ arbitrary legislative calendar.” \nBefore speaking with Lance, Hayes spoke to fellow Republican congressman Steve King and confronted him about the number of people in his district on the ACA exchanges. He asked the same question to Lance as well, and in both cases he told them they got the number wrong. \nWatch above, via MSNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:23:12.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
