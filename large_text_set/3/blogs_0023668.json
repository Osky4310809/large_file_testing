(Photo courtesy Zeke Cohen) The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!\nPresident Trump, Feb. 12, 2017\nOver the past few weeks, the community I represent has been slowly disappearing. First we lost a barber. Then a small-business owner vanished outside of a pharmacy. Finally, a father was handcuffed and detained after dropping off his son at school.\nContrary to President Trump’s tweet, the aforementioned men have no criminal records. They are not gang members or drug dealers. Like my grandmother who fled Austria, they left behind violence and persecution. They came in search of their own American Dream. They built thriving businesses, raised loving families and added texture to our community. Their only perceived sin is their status: They are undocumented.\nI am proud to represent a diverse swath of Southeast Baltimore on the City Council. With our thriving port, the First District has traditionally been a second home to settlers — from Ukraine, Germany, Poland, Greece, Italy and all over the world. Each wave of new arrivals experienced and overcame discrimination. As the Polish community emigrated to Fells Point, anti-Catholic sentiment burned throughout much of America. They erected churches, restaurants and a political establishment as a form of self-protection. Native daughter Barbara Mikulski would go on to become the longest-serving woman in the U.S. Senate.\nMore recently, Baltimore has welcomed a large and growing Central American contingent. Instability in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala has led to a surge of new families moving to our city. Additionally, the International Rescue Center supports refugees from Somalia, Sudan, Iraq and other war wounded countries. These new arrivals have been a blessing for Baltimore. Aside from adding to our cultural vitality, they have helped stem a population decline. Neighborhoods in my District that otherwise might have fallen victim to blight and decay are starting to stabilize and, in some cases, thrive.\nThe recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests have had a chilling effect. Panic has spread throughout the community. Public safety has been undermined. The thin trust between our immigrant neighbors and law enforcement has been shattered. Victims of violent crime are afraid to report. Parents are terrified to send their kids to school. Some people won’t event leave their homes. A trip to the pharmacy could result in arrest and deportation. A 9-year-old child returned home to find that his father, his only parent, had been taken away.\nThe local resistance has been bold and beautiful. Latino youth leaders organized “Salsa on ICE: Dance Against Deportations.” The protest used traditional dance to humanize people who our president has deceitfully called “criminals and rapists.” Casa De Maryland constructed a “Sanctuary Network,” complete with safe houses, churches, schools and a robust “bystander training.” Legislators in Annapolis are poised to pass the “Maryland Trust Act,” which would limit collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE until a person has been convicted of a crime. This law would significantly enhance public safety by rebuilding the broken trust between law enforcement and our immigrant community. After hearing from a group of student leaders, I introduced and the Baltimore City Council unanimously passed a resolution reaffirming our status as a “Welcoming City.” We call on ICE to adopt more humane tactics and focus all of their resources on targeting criminals that actually threaten public safety. These efforts have been led by immigrant organizers, backed by a remarkably varied array of supporters. They are a testament to the resilience of a community under siege.\nDonald Trump will not make America great again. Our country is already great because of the diversity and perseverance of its people. We have chosen to resist not as a personal attack on President Trump, but as an affirmation of our fundamental belief in justice. When the statue of liberty proclaims, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” she calls not only to my Austrian grandmother, but to my Honduran neighbors as well. They deserve all that America has to offer. They deserve liberty and to pursue happiness. Most of all, they deserve life.\nZeke Cohen serves on the Baltimore City Council.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:31:33.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
