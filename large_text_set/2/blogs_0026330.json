It’s the only time when we get to go all out with the ethnic power in our closet. From the looks of it Sonam Kapoor believes in our theory as well. Spotted at a family wedding, Sonam looks like the definition of a desi damsel in this outfit. Sister/stylist Rhea Kapoor picks out this embroidered marvel from Anamika Khanna . Rhea accessorises this contemporary number with a mix of statement jewellery (in silver and gold), a red clutch and a pair of pretty juttis . A post shared by sonamkapoor (@sonamkapoor) on Feb 26, 2017 at 6:06am PST \nWhat we love the most about Sonam’s avatar is that even her hair and makeup looks equally amazing as the outfit. Celebrity makeup artist Namrata Soni gives her dark kohl eyes with a matte plum lip. Celebrity hairstylist Hiral Bhatia gives her big hair with lust-worthy, curly locks. Could this look get any better? We don’t think so! A post shared by Hiral Bhatia (@bbhiral) on Feb 26, 2017 at 7:14am PST \nLoving the clutch?
