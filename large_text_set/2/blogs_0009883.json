She filled out a written application, and then came into the restaurant for an interview. She nervously waited for the final decision.\nThen she got a text from the assistant manager, and uh, WOW:\nvia Twitter Like, how unprofessional can you be?\nFirst, who the heck sends the result of a job application via text? Typically someone would expect a phone call, or at the very least, an email.\nAlso, just sending “it’s a no x.” Um, like what? But that seems 100% normal in comparison to the reason provided when Megan asked why. The assistant manager said she was too basic?\nWhat?\nMegan told media that the whole experience was really bad, and that the manager could’ve actually given her some real feedback:\nThe least she should have given me was some proper feedback. And the laughing face emoji was so unprofessional. It was a really bitchy thing to do.\nThe company has said that the text messages were intended for the general manager, and not the candidate:\nIt was never our intention to be disrespectful or upset her in any way. The texts were sent in error and were intended for our manager, not the candidate.\nHowever, we expect our team to act professionally at all times and to give constructive feedback after any interview via email. We are taking this extremely seriously and will be investigating to ensure it never happens again.\nI guess a cellular phone isn’t “basic” enough technology for the assistant manager. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:19:17.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
