Photo: AP \nIndia had their opportunity to finish off Australia but lacked the knockout blow. They will be ruing Karun Nair's dropped chance off Handscomb when he was on six. It was difficult but one they could not afford to squander on a surprisingly benign fifth-day track against an opponent up for the fight. \nThere will now be renewed confidence in the Australian camp they can retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy when this stirring series reaches its climax in the foothills of the Himalayas in Dharamsala. \nThat the series is locked at 1-1 with one to play is a feather in the caps of the Australians, whom many believed were staring at another humiliating whitewash in India. \nFew would have given them any chance of escaping such a dire situation 24 hours ago but Smith's inexperienced team showed character beyond their years. \nFor that they can thank Marsh and Handscomb, two men at opposite ends of their international careers but still proving their worth at the highest level. \nThe pair added 124 for the fifth wicket but more important was the 374 balls they took out of the game. First they had to tame a rampant Indian team that had their tails up after rolling Matt Renshaw and Smith in the space of four balls. \nThey were also brave enough to attack anything loose, which was vital in erasing the deficit and preventing Virat Kohli from suffocating them with a ring of fielders in close. \nThey also overcame a testing period of reverse swing as well as the constant danger of the rough, which was more concerning to the left-handed Marsh. \n\"You try not to think about it too much, you play the ball,\" Marsh said of the rough. \nThe Western Australian's 53 should go a long way to ending his reputation as one of the underachievers in Australian cricket. Marsh, who is in the finest phase of his career, batted for nearly four hours in a performance up there with any of his Test centuries. \nMarsh narrowly survived a stumping chance on 38 in the first over after tea but was otherwise stout in defence. \nHis partner, Handscomb, made a seamless transition to Test cricket during the home summer however this tour had thus far been punctuated with starts but nothing of substance. \nThat changed here after a 261-minute long display of defiance. It will not go down as his prettiest knock but was arguably more important than any of his efforts against the hapless Pakistan.
