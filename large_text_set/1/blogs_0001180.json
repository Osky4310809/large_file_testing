After just his first season in the Bay Area, his mostly losing season — finishing just better than the Browns -- didn’t deserve a second chance in the eyes of the team.\nKelly’s expected firing is a part of “sweeping chhanges, per Schefter, with general manager Trent Baalke expected to be fired as well.\nSan Francisco closes out its regular season on Sunday afternoon against the division rival Seattle Seahawks.\nKelly’s commitment to the team was never questioned, especially after he coached just two days after his father’s death in early December. And he offered no excuses in that week’s 26-6 loss to the Bears — which included 106 penalty yards and an offense that only recorded 54 yards the entire second half.\nThe 2016 season was just Kelly’s fourth in the NFL, coming from a three year try in Philadelphia. The coach had issues in and out of the locker room, but the issues he had with Eagles players didn’t seem to follow him to San Francisco. He publicly supported quarterback Colin Kaepernick early in the year, and seemed to be invested in teaching him a brand new scheme and improving his turnover margin.\nEven before the season, Kaepernick wanted a trade and then spent five weeks on the bench with “arm fatigue”. Despite Kelly’s best effort, it was reported in early December that the quarterback would be opting out of his 2017 option following the season, and the head coach would be starting all over — again. His overall NFL coaching record is 28–35 (.444), a far cry from being 46–7 (.868) in the NCAA.\nAs soon as Chip Kelly’s future comes into question, the rumor mills go directly to him returning to college football. There is certainly interest from schools in bringing Kelly back into the college-fold — Maryland's president, Wallace Loh, made several direct comments about trying to land the head coach in 2015.
