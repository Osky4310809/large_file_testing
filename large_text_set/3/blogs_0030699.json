(Photo: Gregg DeGuire, WireImage) 95   \nSarah Silverman's political comedy is headed to Hulu. \nSilverman, a former Bernie Sanders surrogate who has frequently spoken out against President Trump , is teaming up with Funny or Die for I Love You, America , a weekly half-hour comedy on Hulu. \nThe ten-episode series, led by executive producers Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Amy Zvi, features Silverman \"(discussing) the current political/emotional landscape of the country,\" Hulu says. \nWhile late-night shows often play up the differences between Americans on opposite sides of the political spectrum, Silverman's new program aims to sow seeds of unity, by interacting with Americans with whom she doesn't necessarily agree. \n\"While it's great to connect with like-minded people, Silverman feels it's crucial, now more than ever, to connect with un-like-minded people\" to \"expose the fact that we are all the same.\" \nSilverman's upcoming projects include a new Netflix comedy special premiering on May 30, a follow-up to her 2013 Emmy-winning HBO special Sarah Silverman: We are Miracles .
