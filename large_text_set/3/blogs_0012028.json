She did manage to provide a viral example of liberal ignorance.   \nAnother masterful interview by Tucker. \nThe only thing I wish Tucker had mentioned was that there are thousands of health centers across the country who can provide all the services PP does minus abortion. All you have to do is strip PP of the money and reallocate it to the health centers and the problem is solved. PP can go ahead providing abortions all they want by raising money from the private sector like every other non-profit does. \nOther than that, Tucker wiped the floor with her. \nYou ever notice how liberals just repeat the same talking point over and over without answering the question?   \nThe reality of the situation is that this woman knows stopping a heartbeat is wrong.   \nShe just can’t bring herself to admit it.  3'); }); \nThis interview really tells you everything you need to know about Planned Parenthood. \nProps to Tucker. Without a doubt the best show on cable news.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:38:27.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
