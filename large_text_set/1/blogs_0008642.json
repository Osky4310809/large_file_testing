So I'd like to hear from her today, if she wants to come and continue her platform on behalf of the disabled. And Donald Trump is absolutely right. He has debunked this so many times. She sounds like 2014. The election is over. She lost. And he is absolutely right about something else too. Everybody in that audience with very few exceptions was of a single myopic mind of how they wanted the election to go and how they expected the election to go. They lost. And I really wish she would have stood up last night and said I didn't like the election results but he is our president and we're going to support him. But this is Hollywood. I think where there is self-pity, a lot more self-awareness would do them some charm. Talking about how vilified poor Hollywood is, in their gazillion-dollar gowns. Can I borrow a couple of those for the inaugural address?
