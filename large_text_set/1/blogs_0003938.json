The reality TV star remained mostly silence about the happening since then and even left Instagram for many months, only having returned recently onto the platform. She was accused of faking the robbery as well. It looks like Kim is finally opening up both about the life-threatening nightmare and as well about her husband’s mental breakdown in late 2016. Kanye West ended up in hospital in late 2016 for mental exhaustion reasons and even cancelled the remainder of his Saint Pablo tour. Watch a first teaser of the new season of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” here above, where you see Kim Kardashian talk about Paris and Kanye. The new season of the show officially airs March 2017.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T12:17:29.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
