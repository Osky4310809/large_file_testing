So hurray, 5,000 yards! Fred says: Jan 1, 2017 6:31 PM \nHe cares more about padding his stats and taking up tons of cap space than actually winning. lsuzilla says: Jan 1, 2017 6:37 PM \nOr maybe Bree’s can redo his contract so they can get good players around him? grogansheroes says: Jan 1, 2017 6:42 PM \nHe’s the modern day Dan Marino. Puts up unreal stats, but almost never wins. MannamedJay says: Jan 1, 2017 6:42 PM \nWhy do people complain about his salary? First he is a top 5 QB in the league and maybe all time, and second, ownership had the option NOT to pay him and let him go. I’m sure everyone complaining about his cap hit would gladly go to their boss and say “no, I make enough. Give the rest of the money you were going to pay me to someone else, I’m good.” Theres around 25-28 other teams in the league that would love to pay him “too much”. arosspen says: Jan 1, 2017 6:43 PM \nHe did a new team friendly contract already, dudes. He’s worth what he gets paid. Do a little comparison of his cap number for this year and next to other qbs. Let me know what you find out. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment.
