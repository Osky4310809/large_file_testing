He stated: “It was evident in the last quarter of 2016 that total OECD commercial oil stocks were falling, and it is expected that we will see a further drop during 2017, as a result of these decisions and developments. We will continue to focus on the level of inventory drawdown to bring the level closer to the five-year industry average. \n“These decisions should also mean that prices stabilise at levels that are more conducive to the kind of investments the industry needs, specifically by lessening the financial and operational stresses for companies and reducing the pressure to cancel or postpone planned projects. We believe as the market rebalances the price will find its equilibrium. \n“The gravity of the sharp contraction in oil industry investment is underscored in the fact that in both 2015 and 2016 we witnessed a dramatic rationalization of projects.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:17:52.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
