In his first press conference in over one hundred days, Donald Trump indirectly addressed some of the more salacious details of the unconfirmed memo released by Buzzfeed Tuesday, denying they ever happened.\nA reporter asked Trump point-black if he had ever done anything in Moscow he later regretted and that the Russians could use to blackmail him.
