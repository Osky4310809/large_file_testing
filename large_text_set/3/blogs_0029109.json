And it didn’t stop there. Players , coaches , the media , and other league personnel have been unapologetically vocal in their dissent of the controversial agenda he’s tried to push since taking office. \nGrizzlies forward Vince Carter joined the fray recently in the most amusing way imaginable, i.e. by taking arguably the most iconic poster dunk of his career and making Donald Trump the victim of his aerial wrath on this glorious new graphic t-shirt. \n#VinceCarter dunks Trump? Former Raptor 'will definitely' wear sassy T-shirt @mrvincecarter @TheDoctorCarson https://t.co/KG7DnvsFHC pic.twitter.com/NTIc6uEbvT \n— Peter Edwards (@PeterEdwards3) March 27, 2017 \n\nThe shirt was apparently a gift from Fox Sports writer Dan Carson and is available at TeePublic.com for just $20. Carter, for his part, seemed pretty psyched about it and apparently isn’t at all worried about the backlash that might accompany it. \n\n“Pretty cool,” Carter said. “Brings back good memories. I mean, of course, it wasn’t Donald Trump, but I appreciate the shirt, man. I definitely will wear it, so hopefully you can get a picture or see a picture of me wearing that. It’ll probably bring up some controversy, but hey, it’s all worth it.” \nGiven his thin skin and general pettiness, it seems inevitable that Trump will fire back with angry, humorless tweets directed at Carter and probably the league as a whole and maybe even the t-shirt makers. But getting utterly annihilated by Vince Carter in his prime is a pretty apt way to depict how his healthcare reform bill fell apart last week.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:17:53.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
