It’s also one of the 10 tiniest houses in Boston , period. Despite its diminutive size, 54 Snow Hill certainly packs a lot in. There’s a bedroom loft, for one thing, and a full kitchen. There is also a full bathroom and a living room. There’s even a fireplace and a private patio. FYI, too: The owner regularly rents the place out for between $2,600 and $3,400 a month, depending on the time of year and the length of the lease.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:29:56.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
