Photograph: Image Source/Getty Images   Friday 17 March 2017 01.45 GMT Last modified on Friday 17 March 2017 01.46 GMT \nMore than 1,100 complaints of child sexual abuse in the Anglican church at the hands of hundreds of clergy and laypeople were made in Australia over 35 years, new data shows. \nThe child abuse royal commission released another tranche of data about Australia’s churches on Friday, this time revealing the scale of the abuse crisis within the Anglican church’s parishes, schools and youth groups. \nThe data shows that 1,115 complaints of child sexual abuse were received by the church between 1980 and the end of 2015, involving 22 of the 23 Anglican dioceses in Australia. Those complaints were made by 1,082 survivors against 569 named and 133 unnamed perpetrators. 4,444 victims: extent of abuse in Catholic church in Australia revealed Read more \nThe alleged abuse took place at the hands of 285 laypeople and 247 ordained clergy. The royal commission has referred 84 alleged perpetrators to police, four of whom have been prosecuted and 23 are still under investigation. \nPrevious hearings of the royal commission have heard damning evidence about the church’s handling of child sexual abuse . The church actively worked to discourage survivors from complaining and failed comprehensively in its handling of perpetrators. \nIn the Church of England Boys’ Society, a youth group for boys between six and 16, networks of perpetrators existed across Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane and Tasmania. \nThe general secretary of the church’s general synod, Anne Hywood, made a statement to the royal commission on Friday. She acknowledged the church had been more concerned with its own reputation than those who had been harmed, and had failed to act to protect children when it became aware of abuse. \n“We have witnessed first hand the suffering of those who have shared their stories,” she said. “We have seen in their faces and heard in their voices not only the pain of the abuse they suffered as a child, but the further damage we inflicted when they came forward as adults, seeking justice and comfort, and we pushed them aside. \n“We are appalled at the stark presentation of the number of abusers and those they harmed.” \nHywood said the church was “prepared to confront” the challenges ahead. She repeated an unreserved apology to survivors. \n“We apologise for the shameful way we actively worked against and discouraged those who came to us and reported abuse,” Hywood said. “We are ashamed to acknowledge that we only took notice when the survivors of abuse became a threat to us.” \nThe networks of abusers had knowledge of each other’s activities, the royal commission found. \nThe counsel assisting, Gail Furness, SC, said the autonomous and unregulated nature of the society’s various branches had contributed to the abuse. \n“The royal commission found that these factors, combined with the nature of the activities run by [the Church of England Boys’ Society], such as overnight trips and camps, provided access to boys and opportunities to sexually abuse those boys,” Furness said. \nThe royal commission had earlier found that the church’s Grafton diocese took a hard line and legalistic approach to survivors of abuse at the North Coast children’s home in Lismore, and failed to follow its own policies for responding to complaints. \nIt found that as recently as 2000, a headmaster who failed to act on child abuse complaints was promoted to executive director of the Anglican Schools Commission. That occurred despite members of the appointing committee being aware that the headmaster had failed to act. \nIn total, the Anglican church, known as the Church of England until 1981, has paid $31m in compensation to survivors. \nLess than half of all abuse complaints resulted in compensation and survivors received an average of $67,000. The most any survivor received was $113,000. \nNine per cent of all private sessions held by the royal commission involved survivors of abuse within the Anglican church. \nThe Anglican church issued a statement shortly before the royal commission hearing began on Friday. The Anglican primate, Archbishop Philip Freier, said his church had a “pronounced appetite” for change and was eagerly awaiting the royal commission’s recommendations. \n“Anglicans have been truly shocked and dismayed at the unfolding in the royal commission of the scope of our failure to tackle child sexual abuse within the church and the depth of survivors’ pain and suffering,” Freier said. \n“We are deeply ashamed of the many ways in which we have let down survivors, both in the way we have acted and the way we have failed to act.” Newcastle bishop resigns, saying he was threatened after revealing abuse by clergy Read more \nFurness said the church had cooperated with the royal commission’s attempts to obtain the data. The royal commission gathered the information using a complaints survey and engaged data specialists, who then liaised with the 23 dioceses. \nThe results, which only include survivors who were able to lodge a complaint, are likely to underreport the true scale of child sexual abuse within the church. \nThey are not directly comparable to shocking figures released about the Catholic church last month , which related to redress claims made against the church, rather than complaints. \nFriday’s revelations come after years of royal commission investigations into the Anglican church. \nThe church was first ordered to produce documents in April 2013 and the royal commission has since received roughly 1.5m documents. The royal commission has heard from 169 witnesses and held 500 private sessions associated with the church.
