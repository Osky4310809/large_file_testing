At the center of the contention was whose faction gets to use the bicycle, the party’s logo since its inception in 1992.\nThe Election Commission of India said the group led by younger Akhilesh Yadav is the genuine Samajwadi Party and “is entitled to use its name and (the) reserved symbol ‘bicycle’” because it had the support of the majority of the party cadre.\nJostling over political symbols is an established trend in India, especially when parties split.\nThe emblems are valuable because they could be used to solicit voters’ loyalty that would have taken years to cultivate.\nCongress, the current national main opposition party, has had to choose new symbols in the past after party splits. It settled for its current symbol–an open palm, which a party leader said stands for hard work and toil–ahead of the 1980 elections.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party meanwhile has retained its original election symbol– the lotus flower, that epitomizes creativity and prosperity in Hinduism–since its formation in 1980.\nThe bicycle has significant brand value for the Samajwadi Party, which has its voter base in the mostly rural and agrarian Uttar Pradesh, where the human-powered vehicle is one of the most-favored and affordable means of transportation. To connect to voters, the party’s leaders often cycle during campaigns and distribute bikes to their supporters.\nThe party says on its website that it “gives immense importance to the development of common man and thus adopted the vehicle of the common man–a bicycle as its symbol.”\n \n\nShare this: Elections India Samajwadi Party State Elections Uttar Pradesh Previous This Is Just How Unequal India Is", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T07:35:38.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
