(@christiecreative) on Feb 21, 2017 at 8:50am PST My illustration project, 100 Day Yoga Crash Course , was born from the intention to simplify the different aspects of the yoga world and to make the philosophy of yoga more accessible to everyone. \nThe project is meant to shed light on aspects of yoga that can be strange or mysterious: meditation , ayurvedic healing and pranayama technique. My blog is both for yogi gurus and people who are just curious about yoga practice. \nThe Instagram project began on 1st December in 2016 and lasts for 100 days (85 and counting!) \nAs an artist, I am inspired most by travelling—it allows you to see life through another lens, just like yoga. I’ve met many inspirational people throughout my travels , but an endless pool of inspiration for this project are the yogis on Instagram.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:06:48.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
