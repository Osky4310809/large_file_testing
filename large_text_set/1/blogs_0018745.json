Traveling is often about splurging, letting loose, and treating yourself. But for the truly fitness minded, a week away from the gym sounds like pure stress, which is actually the opposite of how a vacation is meant to make you feel. To help ease your anxiety, these hotel brands have fitness baked (never fried) into their design concepts, helping you to stick to your goals while away from home. 1/7 IHG EVEN Hotels \nThis new-ish brand concept from InterContinental Hotels Group is for travelers who have serious health and wellness goals. EVEN Hotels makes it easy to stay on track. Not only do their fitness centers go beyond the rinky-dink hotel gyms with a rackety treadmill and mismatched weights, but their in-room design is complete with cork flooring, personal training equipment, and fitness videos. \nMenus at EVEN’s Cork & Kale restaurants are designed with all types of diets in mind, whether you’re counting macros, going gluten-free, or subscribe to any sort of “-itarian” lifestyle, with menu items labeled as super foods, vegan, under 426 calories, with 20 grams of protein, and more. Find EVEN Hotels in five locations in New York City (including Brooklyn); Norwalk, CT; Rockville, MD, and Omaha, NE, with more slated to open down the line. 2/7 Starwood Hotels Westin \nStarwood’s upper class hotel brand, Westin, has developed its signature Westin Wellness program to help you maintain (and enhance) your current routine. The brand partners with New Balance to provide a Gear Lending program: For a $5 fee (or currency equivalent), the hotel will deliver workout shoes and clothing to your room. (All clothing is immediately laundered after use, insoles in sneakers are replaced, and the socks are yours to keep.) \nWestin also has its own Run Concierge, who has scoped out the best 3- and 5-mile running routes in the area around the hotel. On top of that, Westin has 24/7 fitness studios and FitStar Premium, an app-based guide chock full of video workouts that you can do in your hotel room. Some Westins even have the option of booking a guest room with a treadmill or stationary bike. Basically Westin tries to eliminate every excuse in the book for missing your workout, so if you do, it’s entirely on you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T06:28:54.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
