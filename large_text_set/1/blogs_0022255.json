She then walked onto the property later that same morning to commit her bizarre crime spree. \nWeidman reportedly has worked for the U.S. Postal Service since 1999, the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel reported. It is unclear whether this incident would result in her dismissal. \nHer age was not immediately clear as of Tuesday morning. Some news services were reporting that she was 51, while others were reporting that she was 48. We suggest that she was old enough to know better in either case but that mental health issues might have been a factor. \nThis incident possibly was not politically motivated but was rather the result of Weidman suffering from some sort of mental breakdown . Why else would someone hide balloons in bushes and smear bananas on people’s cars?
