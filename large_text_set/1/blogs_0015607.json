Leeds new owner Andrea Radrizzani says they will be active in the transfer market \n“It’s not a big issue, to be honest. We are in communication – myself, Massimo and Garry,” he said. \n“I see that all the three parties are convinced and have the intention to stay together. Sooner or later we will sit down. \n“At the moment, everyone is focused on the day-to-day work. We will fix this, I am very confident we will fix it.” WATCH: Highlights of Leeds United win over Derby County \nMonk succeeded Steve Evans, who was the sixth manager to be sacked by Cellino in his two-and-a-half-year spell at the helm, in June 2016. \nHe has guided the Yorkshire club to 15 Championship wins, three draws and eight defeats in his 26 league games in charge.
