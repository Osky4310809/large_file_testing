While most LG devices have a double tap to wake feature (what they call “KnockON”), you’ll have a hard time finding this feature on devices from other manufacturers.\nWith a custom kernel such as the popular ElementalX by XDA Recognized Developer flar2 , you can use double tap to wake on a wide range of previously unsupported devices. If a custom kernel isn’t available for your device, sometimes you can use a hidden toggle to enable double tap to wake – provided that the stock kernel has support for it. This is true for certain Huawei/Honor devices such as the Huawei Mate 8 and Huawei P9 . With root access , you can enable the native double tap to wake feature that was disabled by Huawei. \nDouble Tap to Wake on Some Huawei/Honor Phones Discovered by XDA Senior Member ajsmsg78 , you can enable double tap to wake on certain Huawei/Honor phones that have kernel support for the feature by editing two files on your device.\nThe first file you will need to edit is build.prop located in /system. Open up the file with a root explorer application (or a build.prop editor from the Play Store) and change the following line from\nro.config.hw_easywakeup=false \nto\nro.config.hw_easywakeup=true \nIf you can’t find this line in build.prop, just manually add it to the file.\nNext, we’ll modify another file called hw_easywakeupmotion_config.xml located in /system/emui/base/xml . Again, open up this file with a root explorer application and changing the following line from\n<EasyWakeupMotion name=\"Double_Touch\" support=\"1\" value=\"0\" flag=\"0\" keycode=\"131\" /> \nto\n<EasyWakeupMotion name=\"Double_Touch\" support=\"1\" value=\"1\" flag=\"0\" keycode=\"131\" /> \nIf you can’t find this line in the XML file, then manually add it near the end. Once you reboot, you will find a new “ Double tap ” feature located in Settings –> Smart Assistance –> Motion Control. Enable the feature then reboot one more time, and you should now have double tap to wake!\nAlternatively, rather than manually editing these two files, you can flash this zip in recovery made by XDA Senior Member paulobrien .\nUsers on our forums have confirmed that this works for the Huawei Mate 8 and Huawei P9, but have been unable to get this working on the Huawei Mate 9. Try it out on your rooted Huawei/Honor device and let us know if it works for you! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:33:02.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
