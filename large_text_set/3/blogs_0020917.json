It is important to attempt an answer without resorting to polemic or hyperbole. To suggest Modi is already the “most popular leader since Independence” is premature. Equally, or perhaps more so, to be churlish and dismiss Modi as a “great campaigner” but not a “great leader” is hypocritical and dishonest.\nTwo episodes from the recent election period offer clues to Modi’s thinking, his instincts and ultimately his leadership. These may not convince everybody, but nevertheless merit reflection. The first concerns Modi’s ethic of governance and the second his political instinct.\nOn March 2, with two rounds of voting to go in Uttar Pradesh, the Union government raised the price of non-subsidised LPG by Rs 86 per cylinder. News reports described this hike as the “steepest in India’s history”. A month earlier, on February 1, three days before Goa and Punjab voted and 10 days prior to polling stations opening in UP, the price of an LPG cylinder had been raised by Rs 66.50.\nThe easier availability of LPG cylinders, especially to poorer sections, was a campaign theme of the BJP. This was built on a cross-subsidy created by better-off consumers who paid full price and who were affected by the February 1 and March 2 price increases. On the eve of elections these moves could well have backfired. Many would have advocated caution; Modi persisted.\nAn analogy would help here. In February-March 2012, UP saw an assembly election on which the Congress and Rahul Gandhi pinned many hopes. The then UPA government was supportive, as could be expected. What did it do?\nFor a year before the election, global oil prices were rising. A recalibration of prices in the domestic market was called for. Yet, the UPA government decided not to inconvenience the Congress’s UP campaign.\nThe issue of energy prices and the unsustainable subsidy on diesel worried economists, but the government was unmoved. Between June 2011 and September 2012 diesel prices were not raised. Rahul Gandhi’s canvassing in UP took precedence.\nThe impact on the economy was substantial. The fiscal deficit rose. Discrepancy between diesel and petrol prices led to a surge in the sale of diesel-fuelled cars. In turn, this dieselisation of the automobile industry hurt companies that had invested in petrol engine capacities.\nOther than jeopardising calculations in the automobile industry – one of India’s few manufacturing success stories – the increase in the number of diesel cars had an environmental impact.\nIn Delhi, for instance, it contributed to the nullifying of hard-won gains in air quality following the mandating of CNG for public transport a decade earlier. That failure to raise diesel prices for a good 15 months had a cascading effect. It became emblematic of the economic mess the UPA left behind in 2014.\nRather than write long essays on how Modi compares to Indira Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru – irrelevant in a current context – it is more appropriate to study the prime minister’s administrative and policy actions in contrast to those of the immediate predecessor government.\nThat is what a contemporary voter will go by. In the case of LPG price hikes, it would also negate the lazy assumption that the electorate rewards only populism and punishes a government taking hard decisions. Despite the price rise, UP renewed its faith in Modi – not because it was happy to pay more (nobody ever is) but because it trusted Modi with doing the right thing.\nThe second episode has to do with Modi’s three-day campaign in Varanasi and the Poorvanchal region of eastern UP. Why did he do this? Was he worried about his own re-election from his Lok Sabha constituency, as some wide-eyed commentators suggested? Should prime ministers campaign so vigorously in state elections, even elections in states that “adopt” them? Was Manmohan Singh’s degree of involvement in the 2006 and 2011 assembly elections in Assam (a state he represents in Parliament) the appropriate role model for Modi?\nDepending on how one sees it, these are very good questions or very silly questions. Fundamentally, they flow from an artificial distinction some make between governance as a technocratic, managerial exercise and politics as a muscular and passionate impulse, with philosophical or even ideological moorings.\nTo be honest, there is no single template for political leadership. The chief executive who “does not read a file” (Vajpayee and Reagan) but defines big goals offers one approach. The prime minister as super-bureaucrat (Manmohan Singh) offers another. Modi presents a third example: of a driven, 24/7 political animal who seeks to validate his electoral appeal and use the resultant political capital to drive his government’s priority initiatives.\nThis dual role is in the best traditions of democracy; it is also a model that governments in Delhi have been unused to for a considerable period. It explained the disquiet when Modi went to Varanasi for the final leg of the campaign – a general in the trenches.\nThis galvanised party workers who redoubled efforts simply because the prime minister himself was taking to the streets to mobilise voters. Modi’s last-mile charge was about the passion and drama of popular politics. Most of all, it was about the demonstration of leadership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T04:48:47.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
