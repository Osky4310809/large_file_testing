The car was out of control and was beginning to slow down in speed as it careened off the center divider. Living in LA for most of my life, I know that incidents like this can turn nasty rather quickly. So Kick, without any regard to his expensive Tesla Model S, pulled ahead of the swerving car and created a barrier so it could be stopped. \nAs soon as Kick managed to stop the out of control car, he managed to get the unconscious man out of his car and began to administer first aid. Onlookers aided Kick as they immediately contacted emergency services. \nAlthough Kick’s Tesla did suffer some damage the situation could have been much worse if it weren’t for his swift actions. It was later learned that the unconscious driver did suffer a stroke and without the help of onlookers, he may not have survived the incident. 2 \nCommending Kicks quick judgement, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk took to twitter to congratulate him on his heroic deed and his importance for life rather than his Tesla’s condition. 3 \nMusk further tweeted saying that in appreciation, Tesla will provide all repair costs free of charge. 4 GIF \nThe incident is still under investigation, since Kick technically caused an accident, but no charges or citations are expected. It’s just a case of one good guy doing something to keep others safe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:36:05.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
