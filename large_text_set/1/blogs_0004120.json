Jackson, Usher, Oprah Winfrey, George Lucas, J.J. Abrams, and Bradley Cooper.  \n10 days before the party, the President will address the nation for the final time from McCormick Place in Chicago.  He plans to deliver his farewell speech on January 10, in the same city he gave is introductory speech as President.  \nFirst Lady Michelle Obama also plans to present a farewell speech which she hopes to give to the nation some time this month. \nThe Obamas are no strangers to star-studded parties at the White House, as the President held his 55th birthday there in August, and Michelle had her 50th there in 2014.  Both events were attended by a gala of stars, including Al Roker, Ashley Judd, Donna Karan, and Disney CEO Bob Iger.  \nIn an email to supporters, the President referenced our founding father  as inspiration for his own farewell address.  He wrote: \nIn 1796, as George Washington set the precedent for a peaceful, democratic transfer of power, he also set a precedent by penning a farewell address to the American people. And over the 220 years since, many American presidents have followed his lead. On Tuesday, January 10, I'll go home to Chicago to say my grateful farewell to you, even if you can't be there in person.\nI'm just beginning to write my remarks. But I'm thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you've changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here. \nSince 2009, we've faced our fair share of challenges, and come through them stronger.  That's because we have never let go of a belief that has guided us ever since our founding - our conviction that, together, we can change this country for the better.\nSo I hope you'll join me one last time. Because, for me, it's always been about you.\nAccording to ABC News, the Presidentâ€™s farewell speech will be free and open to the public, but tickets will be required for entry.  Tickets will be distributed in McCormick Park this weekend. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T19:00:26.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
