It seemed like the company had forgotten about them, but today the unexpected happened. The iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus have been officially launche in red.\nThe company previously launched special red cases for the smartphones, but now we have the actual product in red. Known as the Product (RED) iPhone, it comes with a red aluminum finish and yes it will be a part of Apple’s partnership with (RED) to fight against HIV and AIDS.\n\nAfter announcing a new jet black colour option last year and rose gold with the iPhone 6S the new red option is quite interesting. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will be available in the new hue from 24 March in 128GB and 256GB models. Pricing starts at $749 (Rs 82,000 approx). We still need to confirm if the new colour is heading to India.\nApple has been working with (Red) for a while now and all the funds raised go to fund various programs to treat and research HIV and AIDS which includes testing, counseling, treatment and prevention. According to Apple, (Red) has generated more than $465 million (over Rs 3,000 crores) for its Global Fund since the year 2006 and more than $130 million (Rs 850 crores approx) coming from Apple itself.\nThe post Apple launches special red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:57:34.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
