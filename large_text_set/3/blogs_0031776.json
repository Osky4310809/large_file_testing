This year's festivities will be exceptional as it'll be the first convention before the release of The Last Jedi , the Han Solo film, and, sadly, one of the biggest reunions of Star Wars cast members following the tragic death of Carrie Fisher . Among many of this year's incredible guests, it has recently been announced that Mark Hamill will be in attendance to host a tribute to his on-screen sister. (Photo: Lucasfilm ) UP NEXT: No Star Wars Celebration in 2018, Next One In 2019 \nStar Wars released the news themselves on their website with the following announcement: \n\"The legendary actor — known as Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars saga, the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series and the Arkham video game series, host of Mark Hamill’s Pop Culture Quest , and much more — is set to return for his sixth Star Wars Celebration. Hamill, a Star Wars icon, has become a Celebration favorite for his insightful, heartfelt, and very funny talks. At Celebration Orlando, he will be present for all four days of the show, signing autographs and part of some very special programming. \nOn Friday, April 14, fans can attend 'Mark Hamill’s Tribute to Carrie Fisher,' in which the actor remembers the talent, humor, and legacy of his friend and co-star. \nSunday, April 16, will see Hamill take the stage solo (no pun intended) for the appropriately titled 'Hamill Himself,' featuring an hour of anecdotes and audience Q&A. In the past, Hamill has discussed everything from making the Star Wars films to how he gave his complete collection of vintage Star Wars toys to his kids, allowing them to open every single item. (He’ll also throw in the occasional Beatles reference.) Who knows what he’ll discuss this time? \nThe Jedi returns this April. Don’t miss it.\" \nIn addition to appearing at the aforementioned panels, Hamill will also be signing autographs on Saturday afternoon. \nHamill's panels, particularly his tribute to Carrie Fisher, are sure to be some of the most memorable and emotional panels of the whole event. \nAre you going to be checking out Hamill's presentations at this year's Celebration?
