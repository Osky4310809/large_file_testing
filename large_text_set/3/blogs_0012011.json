[The injury] is not serious, but we are being considerate of her while filming to avoid worsening her condition.” \nThe actress’s agency, YNK Entertainment, also reassured, “It’s not a serious injury. She just went to the hospital due to the pain. She is fine as of now, and we are continuing to film without delay.” \nMeanwhile, the new tvN drama “Chicago Typewriter” is a fantasy-romance story that centers around a bestselling author, the “ghost” writer under his name, and the writer’s anti-fan. It will start airing in April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:58:13.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
