But, are you also breaking the rules? Inside the Sporting Club at the Bellevue, most members admit to one or two pet peeves. \n“Maybe grunting out loud, too loud,” said Phil Moran of Center City. \n“Not wiping down after your workout,” added fellow Philly resident Shelley Johnson. \nFor Rick DeOliveira of Center City, “wearing too much cologne” was unwelcome. \nSo, what are the rules of the gym? \nLisa Rothstein, a personal trainer and group fitness instructor, has seen the do’s don’ts and absolute nevers. She says it comes down to three categories, beginning with equipment. \nFrom putting weights back where you found them to tying up equipment. One of the biggest complaints? Folks who don’t clean the machines! \n“If you’re getting a good workout in, you’re probably going to sweat. Proper etiquette? Wipe away your sweat.” \nNext up? Cell phones. From talking too loud for too long to taking one too many gym selfies. \n“Lifting up your shirt, showing off your abs, taking a quick picture,” explained Rothstein. \n“I’d limit that to zero probably,” said Moran. \nAnd never, ever recording anyone else… ever. \n“Definitely not allowed at this gym. That’s an absolute no, no,” said Rothstein. \nFinally… the fine line of social interaction and knowing when it’s not wanted. \n“When they’ve got their ear phones in, that’s code for don’t bother me,” explained Rothstein. \nEspecially if you’re correcting their form. \n“More often than not, it’s not appreciated.” \nAlong the same lines… give it a rest with the pick-up lines. \nAccording to Rothstein, “It’s not match.com . You’re not j-swiping or tindering. The gym isn’t the right place for that.” \nNicole Brewer facebook Follow Philadelphia’s own Nicole Brewer joined CBS 3 in April, 2008 as local television’s first digital journalist, reporting primarily for CBSPhilly.com.
