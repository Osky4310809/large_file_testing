Image copyright AP Image caption Brazilians have become concerned about the quality of the meat they consume \nBut the effort was in vain. China, the EU, South Korea and Chile have now announced restrictions on Brazilian meat products. \nTogether they accounted for nearly one third of Brazilian meat exports in 2016, O Globo newspaper reported. \nBrazil is the world's biggest red meat and poultry exporter. \nOn Friday, federal police raided meat-producing plants and arrested more than 30 people. \nThe government suspended more than 30 senior civil servants who should have spotted the unhygienic and illegal practices. \nThey are being investigated for corruption. \nThree meat-packing plants have been closed and another 21 are being investigated. \nMr Temer said the plants under scrutiny represented a tiny proportion of Brazil's meat industry. \n\"Only 21 units out of 4,837 in Brazil subject to government inspection are facing allegations of irregularities. And only six of them have exported in the past 60 days,\" said Mr Temer at a meeting with foreign diplomats on Sunday. Image copyright AFP Image caption Both JBS and BRF say they are co-operating with the police \nOperation Weak Flesh was launched in the early hours of Friday in six Brazilian states after a two-year investigation. \nFederal police carried out raids in 194 locations, deploying more than 1,000 officers. \nThe investigators allege that some managers bribed health inspectors and politicians to get government certificates for their products. \nThey accuse more than 30 companies of a number of unhygienic practices. Among them are JBS, the world's largest beef exporter, and BRF, the world's top poultry producer. \n\"They used acid and other chemicals to mask the aspect of the product. In some cases, the products used were carcinogenic,\" the police said. \nBoth JBS and BRF said they followed high quality standards and sanitary regulations. \nProsecutors say a percentage of the bribe money was paid to two parties from the governing coalition - the PP and President Michel Temer's PMDB.
