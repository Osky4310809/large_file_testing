There is one year that every school child will know and that year is the year of 2016,â Farage told conservatives. \nâBecause in 2016 we witnessed the beginning of a global political revolution and it is one that is not going to stop and it is one that is going to roll out across the rest of the free world,â he said.

Iâm seeing an elected leader who is trying to put in place the platform on which he was elected! How about that?” Farage said. “What Trump is doing, by trying to put in place that ticket on which he was elected, he is restoring faith in the democratic process, and good for him.” \nFarage also took the occasion to note that Brexit might never have been passed without President Barack Obama’s British visit in which he told Britons they should not leave the European Union. \n“I will, until my dying day, be grateful that President Obama came to my country, intervened in the referendum, and told the United Kingdom, told America’s greatest friend in the world, that if we chose independence we would go to the back of the line,” he said. \nFarage also affirmed his opposition to globalism and noted there are three things that define the true allies his nation has in the world. \nâOur real friends in the world speak English , have common law and stand by us in times of crisis,â he added. \nFarage noted the movement against globalism must not be perceived in a negative light. \n“Weâve got to be clear: Weâre not against anybody based on religion or ethnicity. Weâre not against anybody. But weâre for ourselves, weâre for our country, weâre for our communities, weâre for making our people safe and with less risk from global terror! That is what weâre for! And weâre for our country! And weâre for our people! And we are winning!â he said. \nPrior to the speech, Farage talked to The Guardian about Trump’s executive order on travel and immigration. \nâI just donât get the hypocrisy of all you people. Sixteen countries ban (Israelis) going into them, you donât say a dicky bird. This man says for 90 days heâs going to put a temporary suspension on while he looks at the vetting rules —Â and by the way, Americaâs vetting rules are quite strict already, interestingly —Â working out whether itâs right or not, and itâs being portrayed amongst elements in the media and by many in Western politics as if itâs some sort of road to fascism or something awful,” Farage said. \nâI just frankly think itâs the most massively over-the-top reaction. Now obviously heâs got caught up in legal complexity; heâs going to come back and have another try,â he added. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
