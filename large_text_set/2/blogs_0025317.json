Could   \nThe cast and crew of La La Land were left humiliated at the Oscars after they were given the award for Best Picture by mistake. \nAnd now PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accountancy firm that counts, verifies and delivers the Oscar votes, has explained exactly how it happened. \n\"At the end of the day we made a human error,\" Tim Ryan, U.S. chairman and senior partner of PwC told USA TODAY . \n\"We made a mistake. What happened was, our partner on the left side of the stage, Brian Cullinan, he handed the wrong envelope to Warren Beatty. And then the second we realized that we notified the appropriate parties and corrected the mistake.\" Confusion on stage as the correct envelope is found (Photo: Getty) \n\"We apologise to the cast of La La Land for having to have made those speeches in the time that it took to (correct it),\" says Ryan. \n\"Immediately when it was announced, again, because of our mistake, both our partners who knew who the winner was – and they’re the only two who know – they realised the mistake had been made and they began to notify the appropriate people. \nHe continued: \"It was a little chaotic and just took time to get out onstage and let people know that the mistake was made. And unfortunately that took enough time to get through two and a half acceptance speeches.\" Beatty looked puzzled at first, then handed the envelope to Dunaway who read out the winner, not realising it was wrong (Photo: Rex Features) \nThere was a desperate hunt for the correct winner’s envelope on stage at last night’s Oscars 2017 and a \"sense of urgency\", following that astonishing gaffe that saw the WRONG film crowned Best Picture. \nViewers watched with amazement as presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced La La Land had won the coveted prize, only for Moonlight to be declared the true winner minutes later. \nThey had been given the wrong envelope; instead of the one for Best Picture, they were handed one announcing Emma Stone's earlier win as Best Actress for La La Land.

Horowitz handing the trophy to Moonlight's director Barry Jenkins (Photo: Getty) \n“They asked to see my envelope, which I haven’t opened. Clearly something was wrong. They open my envelope, and it says ‘Emma Stone, La La Land.’” \n“So clearly something is not right,” he continued. \n“The guys in headsets were going around with urgency looking for the other envelope — it just kind of appeared. One of the guys opens it, and it says Moonlight. I took it onstage and went to the microphone and said what I said.” \nHorowitz said on stage that Moonlight was the correct winner, causing plenty of confusion among viewers at home who had been unaware until that point that something was wrong. \nHe graciously added he was happy for the Moonlight team, despite his own disappoinment. \n“We’ve been on the circuit with them for six months. If that kind of thing has to happen, I’m glad to give it to them.” \nMoonlight’s director Barry Jenkins earlier praised the cast and crew of La La Land for being “so gracious” about the shocking Oscars mishap. Jenkins tweeted this photo as proof his movie won Best Picture (Photo: Twitter/Barry Jenkins) \nSpeaking backstage, Moonlight filmmaker Jenkins said: “Things just happen. The folks from La La Land were so gracious. I can’t imagine being in their position. \n“We spent a lot of time together over the last six months, and I can’t imagine being in their position. It’s why I was speechless — I wasn’t speechless because I won, I was so speechless that they had to do that.” \n“I’d never seen that happen before,” he added. “It made a special feeling more special but not in the way I expected. The last 20 minutes of my life have been insane … beyond life changing.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:32:01.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
