Write down short-term and long-term goals. \nEveryone needs goals so they have a firm direction. Write down your goals for the next year, the next five years and for the next couple of decades. It takes time to tick them off, but by writing them down you’re in a better position to achieve them. It sounds silly, but all successful entrepreneurs do this for a reason -- it works. \nRemember to look back on them and update them as your situation changes. You never know what’s around the corner. \nRelated: 7 Productivity Tips to Help You Accomplish Your Biggest Goals 2.
