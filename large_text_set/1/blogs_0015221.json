Up Next Governments suck at social media, but you deserve some blame Photo by SpaceX \nSpaceX 's Falcon 9 reusable rocket made another successful launch and landing on the weekend, marking the company's seventh success since the start of the reusable launch system program in 2013. You can read all about the exciting event here , but this gorgeous photo deserves its own glory. \nIt's just one of a series captured of the rocket's first stage. This is after it successfully separated from the second stage and sent it on to low-Earth orbit with its payload of communications satellites. As it returned to Earth, it landed nearly dead in the middle of the waiting drone ship in the Pacific Ocean, with equipment waiting to record the moment. \nThis isn't just for posterity. If anything were to go wrong with any of its Falcon 9 landings (which it has), visual data can help SpaceX ascertain what that was, and then help them to fix it for the next launch. \nYou can view SpaceX's Flickr Photostream here , with more shots of the landing. \nCNET Magazine : Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition. \nLife, Disrupted : In Europe, millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle.
