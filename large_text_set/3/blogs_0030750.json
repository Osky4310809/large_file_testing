All it was showing was a bit of leg,\" said one pupil. \nThe students watched staff subsequently march their teacher off the school premises as she was suspended pending an investigation. \nPupils have shown their support for Miss Ferguson, who is part of the pastoral care team, and launched a petition called \"Get Miss Ferguson Back\" as they accused the school of being too prudish.

She does so much to help us and we're so upset she's been suspended.\" \nThe petition had more than 250 signatures within just 24 hours of the pupils starting it - with some of signatures coming from parents. \nThe picture itself generated more than 300 comments on Facebook but one pupil said: \"Not a single person thinks there is anything inappropriate about it.\" \nOusedale head teacher Sue Carbert said: \"If we have any concerns about a staff member, this would not be discussed with students. We are aware of rumours but conclusions are being drawn which have no factual basis.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:37:19.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
