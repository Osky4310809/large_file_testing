But what happened to the young White House intern whose relationship with the president led to scandal? Lewinsky was only 22-years-old, when, as a White House intern, she had an affair with the president. \nThe details of the scandal are well known: The blue dress with the president’s DNA on it, the taped conversations with Linda Tripp , the president’s impeachment , the lengthy and graphic report from independent prosecutor Ken Starr, and Bill Clinton’s line, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.” He eventually admitted the contact: \nSince the scandal, Lewinsky has dabbled in several different careers – handbag designer, weight loss pitchwoman – before virtually disappearing from the public stage for a decade while she attended grad school. In the last two years, though, Lewinsky has reemerged into the public spotlight. She has stayed out of political commentary, though, and has not weighed in on the 2016 presidential race.
