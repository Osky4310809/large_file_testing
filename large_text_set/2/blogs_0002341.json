It's already been reported that Malia is doing an internship in NY, but where is Sasha during all this?\nThe couple was pictured alone arriving at a local airport by helicopter to board a plane and fly to Washington D.c., Daily Mail reported. The Obamas were not accompanied by their oldest daughter Malia, who is in New York to start an internship with filmmaker Harvey Weinstein. Younger daughter Sasha was also absent because she is attending high school in Washington.\nYahoo News reported in January that Sasha, 14, will remain at Sidwells Friends in D.C. until graduation and that the Obama family would remain in the city until then.\n\"We're going to have to stay a couple of years so Sasha can finish school,\" Barack Obama said last March, Yahoo reported. \"Transferring someone in the middle of high school. Tough.\"\n\nSasha and Malia did join their parents for a weekend in Palm Springs following the inauguration of Donald Trump Jan. 20.\nThe Obamas spent much of their time in the Virgin Islands relaxing, including at a lunch with billionaire Richard Branson on Jan. 31. Branson owns the island where the Obamas resided during their vacation.\nBut the former President did release a statement on one controversial issue over recent days: President Trump's travel ban on Muslims traveling to the US from seven countries.\n\n\"President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,\" the statement read, according to the Mail.\nObama previously indicated he would intervene into political debates when \"core issues\" were involved.\n\"Citizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake,\" the statement continued.\nAround 100 aids, mainly from the Secret Service, accompanied the Obamas on vacation.\nStaff at the hotel where the couple stayed were forbidden from carrying cell phones to work, according to an anonymous source, and were subject to frequent searches.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:03:46.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
