The plot presented a few challenges, which the pair overcame with a minimalist 12-foot-wide design that comes with its own rooftop garden and indoor hammock. If you need some inspiration, take a closer look at their SkinnySCAR house after the jump.\n\n\nThe plot of land had been vacant for decades due to its small size. However, the couple was determined to efficiently convert the skinny space into a fully livable home. They clad the three-story strucure in a sophisticated black brick with two extra large windows, adding a strong character to the previously empty lot.\nRelated: Super skinny 4-meter-wide home is squeezed between buildings in Tokyo \nhttps://vimeo.com/203146648\nOf course, working with such a narrow space created a number of challenges on the interior. To create a sense of openness, the architects took advantage of the tall, skinny space by building three stories, all with incredibly high ceilings. Multiple large windows offer optimal natural light , and exposed concrete and white walls enhance the minimalist interior design.\nThe entranceway to the 1,506-square-foot space opens up into the kitchen and dining area in the back of the home, which leads out into a shared garden space. The second floor houses a small library and reading lounge that includes a reading hammock that looks out over the interior garden space.\n\nTwo small bedrooms and a unique bathroom with an open shower and aquatic green accents are housed on the third floor. For private outdoor space, the architects put a quaint little herb garden on their rooftop, which shares space with the home's solar array .\n+ SkinnySCAR House \n+ JagerJanssen \nVia New Atlas \nImages via SkinnySCAR House \n\n\n\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:09:15.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
