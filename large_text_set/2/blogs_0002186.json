The opposition are babies who just got a flu shot. It’s for their protection, they know it, but they’re still crying.” \nYou can watch the segment above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:03:37.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
