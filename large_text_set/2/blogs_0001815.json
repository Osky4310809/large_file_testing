That’s how the Atlanta Hawks came from down 20 points with only 8:26 left in the fourth quarter to beat the Houston Rockets on Thursday.\nIn Dwight Howard ’s return to Houston, the Rockets looked ready to coast to an easy win. Then Hardaway Jr. happened, with 23 points in the fourth quarter alone compared to Houston’s 22. This smash just about sealed the win for Atlanta.\nBye, Houston ✌️✌️✌️ pic.twitter.com/K3KHxqrsSm \n— SB Nation NBA (@SBNationNBA) February 3, 2017 Hardaway Jr. was going so good on Thursday that he just decided to take this layup in himself, rather than helping Dwight Howard pad his stats in the revenge game.\nTim Hardaway Jr. is too on fire to pass this to Dwight pic.twitter.com/E4ZARNUwx2 \n— SB Nation NBA (@SBNationNBA) February 3, 2017 Hardaway Jr. — in the starting five since Kyle Korver was dealt — finished shooting 12-of-18 with four threes on his 33-point night. He’s having a career year this season with Atlanta and he’s still just 24, not nearly soon enough to rule out further development.\nAnd hey, if nothing else, he can say he just about single-handedly won an NBA game once.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:57:04.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
