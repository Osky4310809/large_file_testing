Pharrell, who appeared on the episode, echoed Ellen’s sentiments, telling the host that there wasn’t any room for “any kind of prejudice in 2017 and moving on.” \nThe producer said while he loved Burrell, much like he loves everyone else, “we all have to get used to everyone’s differences and understand that this is a big, gigantic, beautiful, colorful world and it only works with inclusion and empathy. It only works that way.” Adding, “Live and let live. Love and let love.” \nEllen added that people like Burrell are why she frequently says “be kind to one another.” It’s something she wholeheartedly believes in as someone who’s faced hate and discrimination for being gay. “I just don’t understand anyone who’s experienced that kind of oppression or anything like that — it only gives me more compassion. It gives me more empty. I don’t want anyone to feel hurt because they’re different.” \nWatch the clip below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T15:41:50.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
