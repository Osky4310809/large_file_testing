Paolo Romero/Twitter \nMANILA, Philippines - Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV failed to block the confirmation of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, who obtained the Commission on Appointments (CA)’s approval yesterday. \nAguirre apologized to Trillanes for calling him a gagong senador (stupid senator) in previous interviews. \n“I’m really wrong in name calling your person,” he said, noting it was the first time that he lost his temper as justice secretary. \nAguirre said he lost his temper after he was implicated in the controversy involving Macau-based gaming tycoon Jack Lam. \nTrillanes said Aguirre was unfit for the position when he asked the CA committee on justice and Judicial and Bar Council to reject his appointment. \nHe said the justice chief was vindictive, vengeful, lacks the required equanimity for him to be entrusted with the power and authority of the government as secretary of justice and is psychologically and emotionally unstable.   \nThe senator cited the reported special privileges granted by Aguirre to convicts of the New Bilibid Prisons in exchange for their testimony against Sen. Leila de Lima on the alleged drug trade at the NBP. \nTrillanes said Aguirre was guilty of tampering with or bribing witnesses, the same claims the justice chief made against De Lima. \nHe said CA should dig deeper into the alleged perks granted to the prisoners. \nHe said the officer in charge of the Armed Forces of the Philippines custodial center and Bureau of Corrections legal office chief Alvin Lim should be summoned to shed light on the issue. \nTrillanes said the CA was pressured by Malacañang to confirm Aguirre. \nAguirre denied granting privileges to prisoners, saying these were mere hearsay. \nHe reminded Trillanes of the time when the senator, along with his fellow Magdalo Group members, faced the Feliciano Commission and that he was the only lawyer they trusted from the side of the government. \nTrillanes said he “used to look at him as an upright lawyer,” but people and circumstances change as seen in the recent events he cited. \nHe said, although confirmed, Aguirre is not yet off the hook because the Senate can still look into the abuses and misuse of power in the Executive branch. \nThe CA deferred the appointment of Social Welfare and Development Secretary Judy Taguiwalo due to lack of time. \nSen. Loren Legarda urged the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate the killings tied to the government’s war against drugs. \nLegarda told Aguirre that she was bothered by the killings, in response to Trillanes’ remark that the DOJ refused to investigate the crimes. \nTrillanes said he does not see Aguirre investigating the killings because “he will just follow orders from his principal who wants to kill people.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:45:47.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
