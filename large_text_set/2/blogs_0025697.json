And Desi Arnaz was practically a national phenomenon. \nSince then, there were no major Oscar nominations for Latinos until the late 1980s, Herrera says. (Edward James Olmos was nominated for his portrayal of Escalante in Stand and Deliver ; Norma Aleandro was nominated for supporting actress for 1987’s Gaby: A True Story. ) That ‘80s wave of success was fueled in part by Chicano social consciousness in the 1960s, particularly in theater, according to Herrera. Valdez of La Bamba fame had founded Teatro Campesino near San Jose in 1965. Olmos won a Tony award in 1979 for his Broadway acting in Valdez’s Zoot Suit . “They were coming from outside Hollywood — from theater — and crossing over into film in the later ‘70s and into the ‘80s,” Herrera says. \nMany of the Latinos who’ve seen recent success in film have launched their careers outside of Hollywood. The Latinos with the most Oscar wins in recent years, Alejandro González Iñárritu (named best director in 2015 and 2016) and Alfonso Cuarón (best director in 2014), are from Mexico City. Sin City director Robert Rodriguez has based his Latino-centric El Rey television network in his hometown of Austin, Texas. Even today’s top Latino Oscar contender, Miranda, is not a product of Hollywood (he’s a New York Puerto Rican). \nMuch of the problem is that 90 percent of decision makers at major Hollywood talent agents are white, according to the 2014 “Hollywood Diversity Report.\" “Hollywood has been aggressive in not engaging with Latino culture in Los Angeles,” Herrera says. \nSome Hollywood executives see the Latino market as a Spanish-language demographic that’s better served by the Mexican film market and the likes of Univision and Telemundo. “When Hollywood thinks Latino, they think niche market, not mainstream market,” Hunt of UCLA says. But 62 percent of Latinos in the United States speak English, according to the Pew Research Center . And the success of La Bamba and Stand and Deliver prove that Latinos yearn to see themselves on the big screen — and not just as gangsters, maids and immigrants. \nLatinos have arguably had more success on television than in film in recent decades. Nericcio of San Diego State University says Melissa Villaseñor , a Mexican-American from Whittier, broke Saturday Night Live ’s “mole ceiling.” And he’s psyched that TBS’ Conan is airing a “Conan Without Borders” show from Mexico City on March 1. \nPart of the solution to the diversity problem in film is educating studios and agencies, according to Herrera. He argues that the industry’s exclusion of Latinos could be partly solved by getting actors, writers and directors gigs on the ground floor. If the talent pipeline isn’t delivering diverse candidates, the Academy Awards will almost never see Latinos in top categories. \nHe warns that Latinos shouldn’t get their hopes up when they see Diego Luna in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story or Gina Rodriguez in Jane the Virgin . “There's still no clear sense that Hollywood is especially invested culturally in Latino talent,” Herrera says. “It’s a cycle. I don't think progress is permanent.” \nHollywood has to look at itself in the context of this great Latino city and take down its studio walls. \n“One of the reasons Latinos can be marginalized politically is we are so marginalized in portrayals in television and film,” says Felix Sanchez, co-founder the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts. “There's no excuse for not courting cult and hiring Latino actors. There's no excuse at all. There's plenty of talent out there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:34:10.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
