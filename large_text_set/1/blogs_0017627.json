Advertisement \nWelcome to Lifehacker’s Monday Brain Buffet , a series where we round up interesting, informative, and thought-provoking podcasts, interviews, articles, and other media that will teach you something new, inspire you, and hopefully start your week off on the right foot. How Hackers Really Steal Your Passwords \nWith the exception of social engineering , which is a very convenient way to steal credentials, most passwords aren’t stolen by simple dictionary attacks or super complicated cracking. In fact, it’s much easier than you think, especially when databases that aren’t properly salted and hashed are concerned. Why Social Engineering Should Be Your Biggest Security Concern Why Social Engineering Should Be Your Biggest Security Concern Why Social Engineering Should Be Your Biggest… We all know the basics—strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and so on. However, the most… Read more Read more \nThis video from DNews explains how evildoers really get their hands on your passwords, and how you’re especially vulnerable if you’re using uncomplicated passwords, popular ones that everyone uses, or easily guessed passwords. In reality, once someone gets their hand on a password database, they just check it for already hashed passwords that are known and long decrypted. So a password like “password123\" or even “passWord123!” already have well-known hashes, and if that hash is found in the database, that’s a cracked account for the taking, no brute forcing required. Of course, salting and hashing password databases is the solution here, but the video goes into more detail. Check it out - and then go change your password to something you don’t know . And get a good password manager while you’re at it. [ via DNews (YouTube) ] You have a ton of options for password managers, but when it comes to your security, you want the… Read more Read more Have You Ever Taken a Job Just for the Perks? \nIf you’re lucky enough to have a job with perks, odds are they’re something simple, like free coffee in the breakroom and maybe an employee discount program with some select retailers or something. But this thread at Quora offers up an interesting question: Have you ever taken a job just for the perks? Advertisement Advertisement \nI mean, some jobs have great perks - Google is kind of famous for this, with their sprawling campus packed with cafeterias and snack shops that cater to all kinds, and on-campus rec and exercise facilities, all for free to employees (and in some cases, their families.) Or maybe getting a job at a stadium just to see your favorite team play for free, or an arena just to get access to the concerts. Of course, many perks are designed to keep you at work as much as possible, but there’s no denying the perks are lovely. This answer in the thread gave me a chuckle: \nGrowing up in Italy, my husband loved bread so much he was literally leaving none left for the family’s dinner. In Italy the bread is bought fresh every morning for the day’s lunch and dinner. \nSo my mother-in-law sent him to work as a delivery boy for the local baker. Problem solved! \nTo this day he loves nothing more than a few slices of salami on some good Italian ciabatta bread. \nBut the question remains. What about you? Have you ever taken a job just for the perks it offered, even if those perks were minimal? [ via Quora ] Could You Make Zero Trash for 30 Days? \nConsidering the average American produces about four pounds of garbage per day , it’s a pretty big challenge to try and produce zero for thirty days , but Buzzfeed’s Auri Jackson tried , and learned a lot along the way. She learned how to adapt, what the stakes are if we don’t start recycling and reusing and repurposing more of the things we bring home and otherwise just toss in the garbage, and she also learned how much of a privilege in itself it was to even try the challenge , since most affordable and accessible foods come in packaging, but things like fresh produce comes in no packaging, but is more expensive. \nThe full five minute video of her challenge is fun and entertaining to watch, but it’s also a bit of an eye opener, and kind of runs counter to the whole “one person really can’t make a difference” mentality that’s so prevalent right now. After all, all we have is ourselves to make a difference with. [ via Buzzfeed (YouTube) , thanks Boing Boing ! ] How Close You Live to a Nuclear Bomb \nSo, how close do you live to a nuclear bomb? Well, if you live in the southern hemisphere, congratulations, you’re probably pretty far from one. But considering 80% of the human population on Earth lives in the northern hemisphere, well, odds are you’re relatively close to one, especially if you’re reading this from inside the United States, in Europe, or somewhere in Russia. Advertisement Sponsored \nThis video, from Real Life Lore, outlines where many countries, including the United States, tend to keep their nuclear weapons and silos, and that’s just on land, and on top of that, what’s public information. It’s also worth keeping in mind that many countries keep a substantial number of nuclear weapons on submarines and other launch platforms at sea, in classified locations. Bottom line though, depending on where you live, you’re either very close—mostly if you live in Europe or western Russia, or substantially farther, like in the United States. \nThat all said though, it’s less whether you live close to one now and whether you live near a city on a nuclear target list, right?
