The officer smelled marijuana, searched Allison’s car and found three cigars, two of which were filled with marijuana, according to the police report. \nAllison, who told police he played for the Packers, was given a speeding citation that came with a $200.50 fine. He has a court appearance on January 23 for the marijuana possession charge. \nAn undrafted rookie out of Illinois, Allison came on strong late in the season, with his two best games of the year coming in Week 16 and Week 17. The Packers will need another big game out of Allison if Jordy Nelson can’t play this week against the Cowboys.
