As soon as I found out, I went to the abortion clinic but could not afford it. My pregnancy advanced and my boyfriend continued to threaten to push me down the stairs or punch me in the stomach.\n“When my parents found out, my dad took me to DC where abortions are legal until 20 weeks. I was put in a large room with about 20 women and one by one we were taken back for the abortion and then brought back in. Each woman came back holding their stomach and crying. The process was quick and heartless.\n“I suffered for two years with depression that went untreated. It has been the most painful and traumatic experience of my life. But I want anyone that reads this to know I do not regret my choice. I did choose life…I chose my life. Having that baby would have kept me in an abusive relationship that I don’t know if I could have survived.”\n—Nicole, 33\nID: 10357061 2. “The moment I said I wanted an abortion, they offered me a free ultrasound, showed me pictures and models of what the fetus looked like, and gave me mountains of pamphlets.” “The first clinic I went to ended up being a Christian counseling center disguised as a pregnancy resource center. The moment I said I wanted an abortion, they offered me a free ultrasound, showed me pictures and models of what the fetus looked like, and gave me mountains of pamphlets. They followed up on a daily basis with phone calls and messages.\n“When I found the real abortion clinic, they were patient, professional, caring, and honestly some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. The doctor who performed the procedure was funny and helpful. He thanked my boyfriend for being there as most men don’t come in for the appointment. I had cookies and juice in a weird recovery room with a bunch of other women and girls before the nurse came and let me leave. It was a surreal experience that has definitely stuck with me, but not in a negative way.\n“I experienced depression for a few months afterward — it flared up whenever I saw pregnant women, but I kept it to myself because my boyfriend didn’t want to talk about it. I often wonder what would have happened if we decided to keep it, but I don’t regret the decision I made. That relationship ended up being toxic, emotionally abusive, and very manipulative, so thinking about what it would have been like to raise a child in that environment is enough to know I made the right decision.”\n—Anonymous, 28\nID: 10338457 3. “We spent $25,000 roughly on fertility treatments. Then this happened.” View this image ›\nKoya79 / Getty Images “My husband and I dealt with infertility for a few years and conceived via IVF. Our child is the light of our lives, but it was hard, and I decided I never wanted to do IVF again. I also didn’t think we needed to use birth control since the doctors called it ‘next to impossible’ that we would conceive naturally.\n“And then, when our child was only 1, we discovered that nothing is impossible. We were shocked. We spent about an hour talking and crying about it and decided to go forward with terminating. I live in a state where it is relatively easy. I called Planned Parenthood and made an appointment for a week out for a ‘medical abortion,’ which is the pill form. I took the pill in the office by myself. And a day and a half later, took the other pill. I took one day off from work.\n“I don’t regret it, but I feel a great deal of shame. We are 35 years old, both have a master’s degree, and make $150,000 a year. We spent $25,000 roughly on fertility treatments. Then this happened. We could never tell our friends and families who are still ‘hoping for a miracle,’ but I’m very happy with one child. I went back to PP for an IUD. But I honestly wish I could erase this from my medical past because I’m afraid of judgment from future medical providers.”\n—Anonymous, 35\nID: 10338388 4. “I was scared and overwhelmed with how I was going to support the two kids I had.” “Twenty years ago I had a surgical abortion in Colorado. My husband had just left me and our two kids, and I found out I was pregnant with a third. I was scared and overwhelmed with how I was going to support the two kids I had.\n“It was a relief when I got an appointment. They gave me a Valium before so I would relax. The machine was loud so I kept talking to drown out the sound. Luckily the nurse knew what I was doing and kept it from being one-sided. After it was done, I still felt relief. Unfortunately, the clinic was shut down a few years later. The nearest clinic is now over four hours away.”\n—Anonymous, 41\nID: 10364227 5. “I had just started my dream job, and I was sure about what I was going to do as soon as I read the positive strip.” View this image ›\nCillay / Getty Images “I was 29 and he was a one-night stand. I had just started my dream job, and I was sure about what I was going to do as soon as I read the positive strip. I had a surgical abortion at six weeks. I had support and was financially stable. The experience was unfortunate, but I have never once regretted my choice.”\n—Anonymous, 39\nID: 10363892 6. “I found out I was pregnant three days after my brother’s funeral.” “I called my mom. I guess she just assumed I was happy about it, and she had me tell my stepdad and my other brother, who were both so excited. My brother even told me it was the first time he had really smiled since our brother died. Everyone saw so much meaning in it. A life was gone and now there’s this new one. So I tried to force myself to be happy with it. But in the following days I just couldn’t do it; rather, I couldn’t do anything. It hit me so hard and so suddenly. I would just crumble on the floor and cry. The whole thing was just too much.\n“Everyone was supportive of me, but my boyfriend of five years was the first person to tell me something that made sense: He told me I was allowed to be selfish. If I wanted that baby, I was allowed to be selfish and have that baby. If I didn’t want that baby, I was allowed to be selfish and not have that baby. There is no wrong decision, I just had to be selfish. What finally made my decision though was looking at my cat and realizing I felt more like a mother looking at her than I did thinking about what was growing inside me. So a week after finding out I was pregnant, I opted to have a medical abortion.\n“The abortion itself was (mostly) a wonderful experience. Everyone working at the clinic was so helpful and supportive. And I got to complete the abortion at home. So the next day I crawled into bed with my boyfriend, put on my super cool adult diapers, inserted the pills, and put on some Game of Thrones . And let me fucking tell you, it was excruciating, like… I honestly believed I could go into shock kind of pain. These cramps radiated throughout my whole body to the point where I could barely breathe. I actually cut my palms on my nails from clenching my fists so hard. But once it was done, it was done.”\n—Maggie, 26\nID: 10363906 7. “I know that people may judge me for being seemingly prepared to have a baby at the time, but we weren’t and we knew it.” View this image ›\nreddit.com “I was 26 and just moved to a new city with my partner, having recently graduated and started new jobs. My partner and I knew we wanted kids, but we were simply not ready at that time. I went to Planned Parenthood, and was reassured that having an abortion would not impact my chances of having children in the future.\n“Ten years later, I’m married to that same partner with two little ones. I know that people may judge me for being seemingly prepared to have a baby at the time, but we weren’t and we knew it. It wasn’t a decision we took lightly, and one that I don’t regret.”\n—Anonymous\nID: 10338820 8. “I have always been very against abortion and wanted the child. However, I knew the odds were very good that I would die in childbirth, leaving the children I already had without a mother.” “I am happily married and have two children already. When my second child was born, I had a brain hemorrhage that almost killed me. I was advised not to have any more children. Seven years later, I got pregnant again. I have always been very against abortion and wanted the child. However, I knew the odds were very good that I would die in childbirth, leaving the children I already had without a mother. I decided to terminate the pregnancy.\n“My best friend accompanied me to a clinic, and escorted me past protesters. Because I was only five weeks pregnant, I qualified for the pill method. However, because I live in Texas, I was required to have an ultrasound to be sure I understood the thing inside me was a baby. As if I didn’t know. I had the ultrasound. The nurse was very sensitive and didn’t force me to look at the ultrasound. I was given information and sent home to wait the required 24 hours.\n“I went back the next day, past more protesters. I was called back with a group of about 10 other women. A nurse read us the required statement and we took a pill to stop the pregnancy from developing. We were all sent home with two more pills to take the next day. I shook the entire day, violently. I bled horrifically. I mourned and cried. Two weeks later, I went back to confirm the pregnancy had indeed been terminated.\n“The next day, Texas passed stricter abortion laws and the clinic shut down.”\n—Katie, 35\nID: 10357263 9. “My boyfriend at the time felt like he was losing me so he started poking holes in condoms.” View this image ›\nSasimoto / Getty Images “I was 22. My boyfriend at the time felt like he was losing me so he started poking holes in condoms. I found out I was pregnant after leaving him. Shortly after, he was arrested for sleeping with a student. He was a special education teacher.\n“Thankfully my regular doctor was able to prescribe me the abortion pill. It was just like a heavy period. I have zero regrets; I do however keep it a secret because of my strict Catholic family. I wish I was strong enough to be more vocal about my experience. The hardest part for me is when a friend or acquaintance is in the same situation and considering one, the vast majority of women I know will say that she shouldn’t do it because she’ll regret it forever.”\n—Jen, 33\nID: 10357030 10. “Our two sons were in state custody, and we were fighting to get them back when I found out I was pregnant.” “My husband and I were going through a hard time. Our two sons were in state custody, and we were fighting to get them back when I found out I was pregnant. We talked about it and decided it would be best to get an abortion rather then have it and then it go into state custody. My two sons were abused while in custody. I chose medical abortion.”\n—Anonymous, 44\nID: 10364354 11. “Despite my taking Plan B, I was in fact, pregnant.” View this image ›\nJustin Sullivan / Getty Images “I was 19 years old and in love with a boy who never really loved or respected me. One night, after having a few too many drinks at the college bar, he took me home and without my permission, failed to pull out. After taking the Plan B pill four hours later, I still felt extremely uneasy. A week later, I took a home pregnancy test only to find out that despite my taking Plan B, I was in fact, pregnant.\n“Completely devastated, the boy I was dating told me that he wasn’t going to take care of the baby and that no one would want to be with a 20-year-old single mom. At the time, I had two family members suffering from cancer and couldn’t fathom completely wrecking their world. I was a promising college student who had the world at her fingertips. I wanted to keep the baby, but I didn’t know how I would be able to provide the necessary resources for it.\n“Two weeks later, I went to the clinic and took the pill that would abort the baby. Scared and alone, I lay on my bed sobbing and trying to find the words in prayer that would help God forgive me. After years of learning to forgive myself, I know that my decision was the best thing for me. I have forgiven myself and more importantly, learned to love myself.”\n—Anonymous, 26\nID: 10338512 12. “Some people might think that that makes me a monster, but it was just the way we handled it. Not emotionless, just rational.” “I was 25 years old and had just started dating my now-husband. We got pregnant accidentally after five months of knowing each other. We knew we wanted kids one day but it just wasn’t the right time — we were just getting to know ourselves and each other, we both lived far away from our families. And deep down I knew I wasn’t ready to be the kind of mother I want to be.\n“So at around four or five weeks pregnant we booked an appointment at a clinic and had the procedure. I paid the extra to get ‘knocked out’ and didn’t feel much pain at all. It was $500 in the DC area. Then we went home and snuggled on the couch and watched movies as I recovered.\n“What amazed/surprised me about the experience was how I was very calm and very sure that we were making the right decision. Some people might think that that makes me a monster, but it was just the way we handled it. Not emotionless, just rational.\n“Plus, we are now married and expecting our first child! There’s nothing wrong with doing things in your own time — parenting is a huge responsibility and if you’re not prepared for it I imagine it’s incredibly difficult. No shame in doing what’s right for you and your partner. After all, it’s nobody else’s business.”\n—Jane, 31\nID: 10357342 13. “ Roe v. Wade had gone into effect four months before.” View this image ›\nDrew Angerer / Getty Images “ Roe v. Wade had gone into effect four months before, and I was able to terminate my pregnancy by vacuum procedure in a nearby, calming, non-abusive, and medically safe environment. The procedure itself unpleasant, but I was cared for through it all with fondness and compassion.\n“It was a close call — the legal limit for abortion was eight weeks and I only had one week to get an appointment. It was a painful but easy decision and although I would grieve every year at that time, there has never been the slightest doubt that it was the right decision both for the baby and for me.”\n—Linda, 69\nID: 10357499 14. “My wanted pregnancy had a severe fetal abnormality that would have resulted in a miscarriage, stillbirth, or a baby who would live only hours after birth.” “At 12 weeks, we decided to terminate instead of waiting, thinking it wouldn’t be difficult because even conservative states have fetal abnormality exceptions.\n“The only clinic in the state had long wait times and protesters. We decided to drive six hours to the next state. This clinic was located in a 12-story medical building, so there were no protesters. The doctors and nurses there were wonderful and understanding, and the procedure itself took five minutes. It cost $800 for the termination, $100 for extra sedatives, and another $500 for a private room (so we didn’t have to be with strangers in the waiting room); our government employee insurance covered none of this.\n“Afterward, I joined an online support group and discovered that my experience was nowhere near the most appalling when it came to terminating a wanted pregnancy; one woman was forced to terminate at a Catholic hospital, where the nurses openly judged her and refused to give her sufficient painkillers; another woman’s clinic ran out of anesthesia the week she went in. I was comparatively lucky to discover my fetal abnormality so early and to have had a relatively easy procedure, but I’m still furious I had to travel out of state and that my usual doctor, whom I admire and trust, couldn’t perform the procedure due to our ridiculous anti-science, anti-women state laws.”\n—Anonymous, 29\nID: 10357175 15. “I didn’t want to know what it felt like to be pregnant yet, I wanted that to be a joyous moment, not one where I felt like I was an animal trapped in a corner needing to chew my own arm off to escape.” View this image ›\nJenny Chang / Via buzzfeed.com “I was careful, I used protection and the morning-after pill. Both had failed me. I no longer felt in control of my own body. It had betrayed me. The first words out of my mouth were that I wanted an abortion. The nurse tried to calm me down and asked if I wanted to hear my options and I said no, I knew what my only real option was. I was a barista living on my own; I barely had enough money to take care of myself and my cat, let alone a child. I wasn’t going to let a broken condom be the reason my entire life would change.\n“I was honestly heartbroken. I had always wanted to get pregnant and be a mom. Now it felt like something that was forced onto me that I didn’t want. I didn’t want to know what it felt like to be pregnant yet, I wanted that to be a joyous moment, not one where I felt like I was an animal trapped in a corner needing to chew my own arm off to escape. If anyone ever asks me what the hardest part of the abortion was I say, ‘Being pregnant for those three days.’ Yes, I had been pregnant for about four weeks at this point. But those three days between finding out and getting the abortion were the absolute worst.\n“I live in Washington state, where abortion services are very accessible. I made an appointment with Planned Parenthood and went in that next week. Because I was so early I was able to do the medical abortion on my own at home. The amazing nurse was so helpful and could see how scared I was. She did the ultrasound (required to see how far along I was), and she kept the volume on mute and I didn’t have to see the ultrasound at all. She gave me the information about what I was going to do (with no judgment whatsoever), and helped me book an appointment to get an IUD two weeks later. I took the first pill in the clinic, with instructions to rest and take the second pill the next day when I was comfortable.\n“After it was over, all I felt was relief. I was so goddamn relieved to not be pregnant anymore. It was over — I felt like I owned my own body again. It was a sad thing that had to happen, but it was the right thing. I don’t know what my life would be like today if I didn’t have the option to make that choice. I still have moments of sadness, but not because I regret having the abortion. I have never regretted it.”\n—Anonymous, 24\nID: 10338919 16. “What she didn’t understand, given the predicament I was currently in, was that I actually identified as gay and that’s why I had left my marriage.” “I was in my early twenties, and I had a 2-year-old at the time. I was newly divorced and had a night of vodka and poor judgment with a friend only to realize several weeks later I was pregnant.\n“I never had a doubt it was the right thing for me. I walked in, had the procedure, and never looked back. Insurance paid for it. I was fortunate. The worst part of the whole ordeal was being scolded by the counselor at the clinic for not opting for an IUD after the procedure. What she didn’t understand, given the predicament I was currently in, was that I actually identified as gay and that’s why I had left my marriage.\n“The procedure itself was uncomfortable but not incredibly painful. I ended up knowing one of the nurses that assisted and she asked if I wanted to see the sac; I said yes. It was interesting. I was 10–12 weeks and it looked like a jellyfish about the size of a quarter. Just a clump of cells. That’s all it was and nothing more.\n“I’ve never second-guessed my decision or wished for any other outcome. I was lucky to have access to the procedure and really lucky to have insurance cover it. I only tell my story when I think it can help someone. Not everyone wishes for ‘what could have been.’ Not everyone feels a ‘loss.’\n“Today, I’m happily married to my wife and we have two beautiful kids.”\n—LJ, 33\nID: 10357464 17. “I am terrified of how many other women are doing such dangerous acts if they are not allowed access to proper medical attention for this matter.” View this image ›\nLeszekczerwonka / Getty Images “I was 18 and fresh out of high school. In a state of depression, I turned to my friends for advice on what to do. Their response: ‘party it out.’ My boyfriend (now ex) loved the idea. He had me take a week off of work and drink all day every day. I thought I was going to die.\n“Aside from how badly I damaged my body, it worked. I got my ‘period’ Christmas day. Thinking it was a normal period, I was happy. Two days later, I had the most painful miscarriage. I was devastated, and the fact that I had destroyed my body tore me up.\n“I thought it was all over, but on New Year’s Day I had to be rushed to the hospital, because I had woken up in a pool of blood so large, it had soaked through the mattress, and I was rushed into surgery. I am alive today thanks to that. I am terrified of how many other woman are doing such dangerous acts if they are not allowed access to proper medical attention for this matter.”\n—Anonymous, 25|\nID: 10357374 18. “I had given birth a year prior and my husband became very sick that same year.” “I had a surgical abortion at age 29 at Planned Parenthood. I had given birth a year prior and my husband became very sick that same year. He passed away three years later. Planned Parenthood gave no judgements. They showed the required ultrasound and film of the pregnancy, allowed me to talk to a counselor and cry, and supported me through the entire process.\n“There was no physical or financial way to provide for another child. I have never felt more relieved than when it was over and have no regrets about my decision to this day. I do mourn the loss of what could have been every time I look at my now 15-year-old. Regret, no. Guilt, some. Primarily, certainty that I made the correct decision for my family and myself.\n“What stands out the most from that day, though, is the memory of the women who were waiting for their procedures taking the time to talk to each other and listen. Supportive women who were all in the same position coming from various circumstances. Strangers who cried and listened together. There wasn’t a woman there who wasn’t extremely grateful for a place like Planned Parenthood or anyone who treated the process as if it were no big deal.”\n—Anonymous, 43\nID: 10339407 19. “It was either I get the abortion, or he beats me to the point where I’d have a miscarriage.” View this image ›\nDjedzura / Getty Images “I was so numb sitting in the waiting room. My face was expressionless and I had no thoughts. My mom was sitting next to me giving me a pep talk. She knew what I was going through.

I didn’t want to do it, but if I didn’t, I would’ve been stuck with a man who hurts me physically, mentally, and emotionally.\n“We got to the room and I immediately lay down. I just wanted it over with. The nurse connected this little glass bottle with some type of medicine to my IV. I recall screaming once but I can’t remember the pain. My mom picked me up and was so supportive. I’m extremely thankful for her. It was very bittersweet. I still think about my unborn child. Was it a he or a she?

My parents were devout Muslims and could not fathom how I had become pregnant, as if their abstinence-centered approach to sex ed had done the job. Being very old-fashioned, they ordered me to keep the baby and threatened to kick me out if I did not comply.\n“For me, however, the social stigma surrounding teen pregnancy was enough to convince me that this baby would come out one way or another. Not only that, the father was a boy I met at one of the few parties I had ever been to, and I was not in a relationship with him, much less would I be able to raise a child with him.\n“So my best friend (a caring girl native to our South Carolina town) and I took a trip to Planned Parenthood after one of our final exams. It was quick and relatively painless, besides the cramps that ensued the day after. I went home and was swiftly kicked out, yet I wouldn’t change a thing. I graduated 10th in my class and stayed with my best friend until we both left for college. This was my choice, and I want everyone to know that whatever you choose to do is OK.

The waves of emotion, severe depression for years due to what I had done, the agonizing physical pain and quantities of blood and tissue that I would lose. There was no after-care or phone calls. No follow-up to see how I was doing. It was like being in a mill where they simply swept our little secrets under the rug and pretended like the problems never existed in the first place.

The truth was, I was more than ready to be able to have a child. I was certainly of age, my career was in a good place, and I was financially independent. But at that point, having a baby was something I never really considered.

And he didn’t have the same commitment to family that I did. When I told him, he said, ‘Get rid of it.’ I knew it was something he didn’t want, but the way he said it was hurtful and harsh. I felt guilty and considered keeping it. I’m not sure why. Ultimately, at nine weeks, I went into Planned Parenthood and asked for the abortion pill. Of course, I paid for it myself and went alone because he couldn’t afford it nor could he be bothered to accompany me.\n“Interestingly, I never felt guilty once I committed to the decision.

He would tell me to keep it one day, and the next he was telling our friends it wasn’t his.

I made the decision immediately.\n“Because I had taken so long to go to a doctor, I had to travel out of state almost four hours to have the operation. It was a two-day process.

This was one of the most painful things I have ever gone through. The next day you came back and had the operation.\n“Looking around the waiting room I could see other women, from all walks of life, going through this same pain, almost in concert.

The next day my mom and I drove up to the clinic where the doctor did blood work, an ultrasound, and explained the abortion process to me. He explained that I was within the window of time that allowed me to take two different pills to induce the abortion, but once I took the medication, I was required to follow through with the abortion due to the medication causing severe birth defects if they were ineffective. Per Arizona law, I had to wait 24 hours after seeing a medical professional to make my decision. So my mom and I drove home and the next morning we drove back up to the clinic where I received the medication.\n“Two weeks later I went up to the clinic for a follow-up ultrasound to see if the medication had worked. The ultrasound revealed that the fetus was still in my uterus but no longer had a heartbeat. The doctor explained that this happens to only 1% of women who get abortions and that I needed to have a D&C which included dilating my cervix and manually removing the fetus. The procedure was painful, but successful. My insurance would not cover the cost of the abortion. I ended up having to use $1,000 from my student loan to pay for it.\n“Fast-forward four years to the present: I am now a registered nurse working a full-time job and I’m still with my boyfriend.

Abortion was absolutely the right decision for me.”\n—Anonymous, 29\nID: 10357406 42. “I was supposed to go back for a checkup in two weeks to ensure all the tissue had been passed, but because the clinic was understaffed, they had to schedule my follow-up appointment for three weeks later.” “I was 25 and in a serious relationship but not ready for a child. I was lucky enough to catch the pregnancy early and make a quick decision, so I had my abortion at less than seven weeks. There was a single protester outside of the clinic. I had no second thoughts about my decision, but several of the other women in the clinic looked nervous. I opted for a medical abortion (the pill) since I was so early in the pregnancy.\n“I was supposed to go back for a checkup in two weeks to ensure all the tissue had been passed, but because the clinic was understaffed, they had to schedule my follow-up appointment for three weeks later. Two weeks to the day after I had the abortion, I hemorrhaged. I went to the ER where I had to be given a blood transfusion. They called in a team and I had an emergency D&C at about 4 a.m. and woke up in the ICU just before 7 a.m.\n“I would have died if I hadn’t received such quick care, and I’m extremely grateful to the OB-GYN and the team of nurses. Despite the complications, I have never regretted terminating that pregnancy.”\n—Nina, 27\nID: 10357276 43. “As I was putting the pad on, I looked down and saw what I can only describe as the single most horrific sight.” “It has been a month since I had my abortion and it seems as if I will never stop bleeding. My boyfriend and I have been together for three and a half years, a year and a half of which were spent living apart. One month, I noticed I skipped my period and couldn’t hold any food down to save my life. I took a test and to my surprise, it was positive! I say that because my periods have been irregular over periods of my life due to my battle with anorexia/bulimia.\n“I don’t have any children and we have talked about having children; we even have the names picked out. Still, when I told him, he wasn’t as surprised or happy as I was. As my pregnancy went on, I became very depressed realizing that right now we aren’t in a position to take care of a child and the constant throwing up had triggered my eating disorder once again. We discussed our options and he suggested abortion. My heart sank even though I understood his reasoning and knew we weren’t ready for a child. We asked my mom for the money and she obliged. I went to the doctor and since I was a week shy of being 10 weeks, I had the option of a pill I took there and four pills I would take the following day.\n“Within an hour, I experienced the worst cramps I have ever felt. When the crippling pain subsided enough, I got up to go to the bathroom and put a pad on. As I was putting the pad on, I looked down and saw what I can only describe as the single most horrific sight. I watched my fetus still in its sac fall out of me into the toilet. All I could do was scream and sob.\n“All I have ever wanted was a child and the first time I got pregnant I wasn’t in a stable place in my life to raise one. I’ve been very emotional since then and still bleeding. It has put a huge strain on my relationship and every day has been an emotional battle.”\n—Ally, 29\nID: 10357423 44. “Regardless of a wanted or unwanted pregnancy, abortion is between a doctor and a patient — not a patient and the government.” View this image ›\nSian Butcher / Via buzzfeed.com “My husband and I planned to give our daughter a little brother or sister when she was about 5 months old. We were ecstatic when we got our positive pregnancy test. Everything was going great until we went in for our routine 12-week ultrasound. Our little baby had never developed a brain (ventriculomegaly is the medical term). This very wanted child had a 10% chance of making it to birth. If we did make it to birth, our sweet baby would suffer and die shortly after birth. My husband and I made the most compassionate choice we could and decided to end the pregnancy. I was not going to let my child suffer.\n“My health insurance would not cover abortion under any circumstances, so a few days later I was on my way to Hope Clinic in Illinois. We went out of state to avoid the 72-hour waiting period in Missouri. When we got to the clinic there were protesters outside and escorts had to walk us in. One man yelled to me and my husband as we were entering the building: ‘As soon as you walk into that room and open your legs, your womb becomes a war zone.’\n“I remember wanting to die as I put my feet into the stirrups. I remember the numbing shot into the cervix and I remember the physical feeling of having my baby taken out of me. After that, I don’t remember much except this unbearable pain in my chest and a lot of blood. And as I left, the same protester that greeted me when i first got there yelled, ‘Where’s your baby?! What happened to your baby?!’ Those words have never stopped echoing in my head.\n“Regardless of a wanted or unwanted pregnancy, abortion is between a doctor and a patient — not a patient and the government.”\n—Paige, 23\nID: 10357286 Submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.\nID: 10368221 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/45cdUEPgDv/", "https://www.facebook.com/BuzzfeedCommunity/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/285e3g/wife_took_a_pregnancy_test_and_this_came_up_what/?st=iy6fkcnu&sh=fa2599ea", "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsvdwbgrif4rdkV-GdxpZ2LBHOCcKhVxrpZJZ5vpdXRCKIlA/viewform", "https://www.instagram.com/p/z5tzoMgZww/", "https://unsplash.com/search/photos/sad?photo=wESKMSgZJDo"], "published": "2017-01-22T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T18:59:19.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
