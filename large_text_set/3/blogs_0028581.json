You’ve got Russia. If the president puts Russian dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that’s a Russian connection,” Spicer said. The quip instantly spawned a raft of Twitter jokes about the unglorified sauce. \nThe dialogue between Ryan and Spicer escalated as Ryan expressed her disapproval of the press secretary’s answers. “You’re shaking your head. I appreciate it,” Spicer said sarcastically. “At some point, April, you’re going to have to take no for an answer with respect to whether or not there was collusion,” he continued. \nThe acrimonious exchange continued when Spicer took issue with Ryan’s refusal to accept his responses. “I’m sorry, please stop shaking your head again,\" he said sparking another avalanche of tweets. \nRyan later responded on MSNBC saying the press secretary was trying to make the White House \"look better than what it does right now. Unfortunately, I was roadkill today.” \nSpicer shot to prominence almost as soon as Trump took office when he accused reporters of understating the attendance at Trump’s inauguration. He has since been embroiled in other incidents including being accused of racism when he was caught on tape saying to an American woman of Indian descent that the US was “such a great country that allows you to be here.” \nHe also prompted a flurry of speculation when he attended a press briefing wearing an American flag pin upside down, an official distress signal. He later dismissed the incident as a mistake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:54:31.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
