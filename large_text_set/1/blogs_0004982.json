Or it shouldn’t be. \nIt’s about performance – and respect for things beyond a red, white and blue-colored cloth. \n“I just find it hard to believe. You’re a 2-14 football team. He’s won one football game. What has he inspired?” Theismann asked during the Fox News program. \n“I think that the National Football League has to take a stand. It’s about the veterans … It’s about those that have fought, and served and died. It’s about the police officers that defend our lives.” \nNow, granted, a 2-14 team probably doesn’t have a lot of “inspirational” options to choose from in the first place. And with the firing of NFL-flameout coach Chip Kelly even before the last game of the season was played, the 49ers could be forgiven for not taking the whole exercise all that seriously in terms of football. \nBut that doesn’t mean the players should get a pass for giving an award intended to recognize on-the-field commitment and leadership by example – an award that has previously gone to NFL giants like Y.A. Tittle, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and Steve Young — to a malcontent like Kaepernick masquerading as an activist, just for making headlines. \nBut in the final days of Barack Obama — the Nobel Peace Prize president who blundered through eight years of indecisive, inconclusive warfare that’s left the country more vulnerable than before he took office — it’s a travesty that’s almost fitting.
