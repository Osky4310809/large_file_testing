The effort advances Vallery, Swift and Co. — all present for their rematch — to the district semifinals Tuesday at Garfield Heights. \nThe seventh-seeded Tigers (10-14) will play No. 3 Gilmour, a 72-49 winner against Wickliffe. \nFor Vallery and his teammates, it’s a step closer to redemption. Warrensville lost by two in last year’s district semifinals to eventual state runner-up Villa Angela-St. Joseph without leading scorer Yavari Hall. This group returns to that stage after Vallery scored 24 points and fellow senior guard Sha’Mar Latham added 21 with five 3-pointers.

They trailed by seven points, as Dorian Crutcher and the Panthers attacked the basket and took advantage of 17 turnovers. \nVallery found creases in the EC defense, and Latham scored the tying 3 with 4:30 to go. The fourth quarter concluded with both teams scoring in the final 10 seconds, but Vallery’s end-to-end score with 3.6 left forced overtime. \n“We played bad the whole game,” Vallery said. “We didn’t play our top stuff. We played angry. I told them, ‘We’ve got this.’” \nCrutcher led Elyria Catholic with 21 points. Sean Szabo scored 11 and set the Panthers’ all-time 3-point record in his final game. Szabo hit three 3s Friday, and his last basket cut Warrensville’s overtime lead to one point.

Vallery scored 16 of his 24 in the fourth quarter and overtime. \n“He really took over in overtime,” Elyria Catholic coach Phil Kuchta said. “When you put him out there with Sha’Mar Latham and Brandon Rush , those three guards are as good as any in Northeast Ohio.” \nTo Swift, Vallery’s improvement this season and junior Donte Norris ’ return from injury made this late run — Friday and for the season — possible. \n“He gives us a different look and rotation,” Swift said of Norris, who hit a fourth-quarter 3. “All of those guys fit their roles. Sha’Mar Latham has been great all season.” \nSo has Rush, a sophomore guard who added 11 points and nine rebounds. He scored seven points in the second quarter as Warrensville hushed an early EC surge. The Panthers jumped out to a 10-2 lead, but Vallery served as a calming influence in huddles and talks. \nWarrensville didn’t have that Dec. 28 when it lost to Elyria Catholic, 70-56. \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
