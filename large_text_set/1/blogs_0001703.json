In the words of our favorite Lord Vader: “Do not want!” Advertisement \nLast year, YouTuber GratefulDeadpool dubbed a Chinese bootleg of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, based on a machine’s poorly translated English subtitles from the bootleg’s Mandarin. Several months later, Star Wars The Third Gathers: Backstroke of the West is starting to make the rounds...and for good reason. It’s basically the greatest thing on Earth. I know what I’m watching tonight. In full. \nSeriously, nothing about that isn’t gloriousness defined. It actually makes some of the scenes make more sense than they did before! I’m joking, of course, but it at least makes them entertaining. And if you thought Yoda was already sometimes hard to understand, just imagine what he’s like after 3+ rounds of translation. Spoilers: It’s actually no worse than anyone else. Except for that part where he calls Padme an “intimate friend.” Creepy. \nYou can watch the entire dub on YouTube , at least before someone catches wind and it gets taken down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:23:04.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
