Paul Mariner compares and contrasts Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho's styles, highlighting their defensive differences. \nThe only surprise when Bastian Schweinsteiger announced his transfer to MLS' Chicago Fire this week was that the decision to leave hadn't come earlier. \nJose Mourinho made it clear that the former Germany international had no place in his Manchester United squad, even if he did later renege on that, giving Schweinsteiger four appearances in cup competitions. Still, it would have made sense for him to leave in January with the others. \nFollowing on from Memphis Depay and Morgan Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger is the latest of players to be moved on by Mourinho and the fifth of Louis van Gaal's 13 signings to leave the club. \nIt takes time to build a squad as Mourinho approaches his one-year anniversary as manager of United, but also money. Those three exits alone spell an extra £400,000-a-week at the club's disposal and it's unlikely they will be the only players to have left by the start of next season. \nHere are seven footballers who could leave the club and a decision on whether or not Mourinho should keep them on board: Wayne Rooney \nRooney is probably the most obvious departure , given his poor form and huge salary. The England international still has a further two years remaining on his current deal so he might be keen to cling on, knowing that only a move to China would allow him to earn anything close to his current wage. \nHowever, with Rooney approaching the end of his career, he's unlikely to accept spending another season warming the bench and will be eased out of the club with the goal-scoring record under his belt. That frees up around another £200,000-a-week for United to bring in a player who can justify so much money. \nVerdict: Leave With Wayne Rooney approaching the end of his career, he's unlikely to accept spending another season warming the bench. Zlatan Ibrahimovic \nAnother potential big-name departure could be Ibrahimovic,who has yet to confirm where he will be playing next season. A few months ago, Mourinho implied that his contract extension was more or less a done deal, but the boss has since backtracked. Reports suggest that MLS clubs are keen to take the striker to America, although there may have been potential movement last weekend, with his agent pictured at the team hotel. \nIbrahimovic has been wasteful in front of goal, even if he is the club's top scorer this campaign, but has still played an important role on and off the pitch. He shouldn't continue to start every game if he does stay, but Mourinho should certainly do all he can to convince the player that his future is at United. \nVerdict: Stay Marouane Fellaini \nFellaini is a player who splits opinion, with most supporters agreeing that he doesn't have the talent to be at the club, while Mourinho is clearly a fan. It's hard to think of a player with less ability that's managed to make 120 appearances for United, yet it's undeniable he gives the team a different option. \nThere are plenty of areas United need to strengthen in this summer, so perhaps keeping Fellaini for a further season as an option in midfield makes sense. \nVerdict: Stay Luke Shaw \nWhile Mourinho has shown he likes Fellaini, Shaw is a player the manager has given the cold shoulder. Injuries, poor form and a questionable attitude have meant the left-back has played a peripheral role this season, with Matteo Darmian and Marcos Rojo too regularly chosen in preference to him, despite being poor in this position. \nThat said, before his injury Shaw was a quality player and if Mourinho can bring that sort of form back out in him, United could have their left-back position for the next decade sorted. \nVerdict: Stay It remains to be seen whether Luke Shaw can regain his form at left-back following a string of injuries and lack of playing time. Chris Smalling \nSmalling goes through phases of looking like a great central defender, before putting in comedic performances and appearing totally unreliable. At 27, he should be at his peak, but it looks as though he's still learning his trade. When he plays alongside a solid defender he looks better, but he makes too many silly errors for a player of his experience. Smalling is not a bad squad player to have, but United should bring in a better footballer for the starting lineup. \nVerdict: Jury is out Phil Jones \nAfter a few months of playing well in a partnership with Rojo, Jones has reverted to the injury-prone, mistake-making centre-half that United fans had become accustomed to. Having never fulfilled the potential Sir Alex Ferguson claimed he had despite being six seasons into his United career, it's probably time for the club to cut their losses. \nVerdict: Leave Matteo Darmian \nFinally, another defender whose future is on the line is Darmian, a further Van Gaal purchase who has not made the grade. Despite boasting some great performances for Italy, he's struggled to replicate that form in his time at United. \nAfter a good start, Darmian has gone well off the boil and it's hard to have any confidence in him. He's better on the right than on the left but, truth be told, he has not played well on either side this season. United are not inundated with backups for this position, though, so he might just manage to prolong his United career by a further season and have the opportunity to prove he deserves longer. \nVerdict: Jury is out", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:09:12.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
