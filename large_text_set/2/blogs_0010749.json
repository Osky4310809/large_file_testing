When asked whether Simmons is close to starting those types of activities, Brown was blunt with his assessment. \n“I don’t think so,” Brown said. \n“I feel like he’s moving forward, but to say that we believe he’s going to be ready for 5-on-5 during the All-Star break would be misleading. I don’t see that. Ben Simmons’ debut is looking more and more unlikely. Source: Getty Images \n“He is moving forward but it’s at a very slow pace, our pace. I think when we all get back and he’s around the team again, because it’s not an ideal situation to manufacture 5-on-5 during a break, then we can better craft and construct to allow the return to play to be more responsible.” \nAs noted by Philly.com’s Bob Cooney , the 76ers have just 28 games remaining, which includes a flurry of games away from home. Simmons hasn’t been with the team on road trips, lately, so it’s tough to imagine he’ll be able to get in the required practices while the team is travelling so much. \nWhile the 76ers are keen to develop their two young stars, Simmons and Joel Embiid, the health of the athletes would be paramount, along with the potential of earning a high draft pick in a draft stacked with quality point guards; a team need. \nReached for comment, Simmons’ management told foxpsorts.com.au that no schedule has been set for his NBA debut.
