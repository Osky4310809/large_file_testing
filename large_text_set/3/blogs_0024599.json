So, after a lot of thought and emotion and difficulties we switched to Chris,” Amy told the Daily Mail. \nChris, 33, identifies as a male but had all of his female reproductive organs when he and Amy began trying for their first child.\nHe suffered one miscarriage and five more failed intrauterine insemination treatments but finally he got pregnant with a girl.\n“Being pregnant is such a female thing and that’s when I started to question that it was not what I was,” Chris admitted. “I don’t think I had a problem emotionally having a child, I wasn’t losing a part of my identity. I think the world had a bigger problem with it than I did.”\nThe expectant couple was over the moon but Amy struggled with her own emotions of not being able to initially bear children.\n“When Chris was pregnant it was really difficult because I always thought I would be the one to carry our children. It was definitely a strain and it was difficult,” Amy said.\nChris gave birth on Dec. 20, 2014 to a healthy 8 pound, 11 ounce girl named Hayden.\nAmy, who is legally registered as Hayden’s mother, had taken hormones to help her produce breast milk, but Chris wound up nursing after Amy’s treatment didn’t work.\nThe Rehs-Dupins tried again for a second child and this time, it was Amy who wound up getting pregnant.\nThey welcomed Milo into the world on Oct. 1, 2016.\n“When I was the pregnant one, because I had a husband who had been there before, it was different,” Amy said. “He understood what I was going through, what I was feeling. It was a benefit that not a lot of women have.”\nChris has since begun his transition to become a man and is raising money on GoFundMe to undergo breast reconstruction surgery.\n \n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:42:10.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
