In a report in the Hindustan Times, the 25-year-old from Jharkhand, in eastern India said he was named Saddam Hussein by his grandfather in honour of the Iraqi ruler. However the notorious dictator, with a string of atrocities to his name, was feared by his people and finally executed by the US in 2006 after his government was toppled in 2003. The dictator’s infamy however lives on as the young Saddam is tormented by unemployment simply because multinational shipping companies in India refuse to employ a man whose name will arouse instant suspicion. “People are scared to hire me,” the young Saddam was quoted by the daily as saying. \n\n\nThat sucks. That sucks A LOT. As if the job market isn’t tough enough already (I really don’t know. Is it tough right now? That’s not me trying to be a dick. That’s me having no idea what’s going on in the real world because I refuse to grow up and be an adult). Having the exact same name as a dictator is tough. Real real tough. That dude just wants to be an engineer. And fuck Saddam Hussein for ruining that name for everyone else. He’s the one who sucks. With of that said, I have a hard time feeling too bad for this dude once I stumbled upon this part of the article \n\nFor the first six months, Saddam was stumped as to why he was rejected time and again while those in his batch gained employment relatively easily. \n\nForget that this guy’s name is Saddam Hussein. Forget all of the negative memories that go along with that name. Forget how much people hated the other Saddam Hussein. The fact that this kid didn’t understand why he kept getting rejected is a severe lack of self awareness. He didn’t realize it for SIX MONTHS. Not a day. Not a week. Six months! Self awareness is the key to living a full life and it’s hard to see hiring someone with so little. I’m not saying he should be getting rejected for his name, he shouldn’t be, but he should at least understand why it’s happening. That’s like someone who plays basketball being named Michael Jordan being like, “Why do people keep setting such high standards for me? I don’t get it.” Trent |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:55:57.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
