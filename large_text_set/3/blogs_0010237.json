Jose Roman, 24, faces charges in Cook County Criminal Court in two 2014 gun cases and a separate shooting in 2015. | Photo from Federal Court filing \nCurrently, the law only spells out that prosecutors can ask to deny bail to people charged with illegal gun possession near a school, said Dart’s policy director, Cara Smith. \nShe plans to testify before a state Senate committee Tuesday about the proposed legislation, which was sponsored by Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago. \n“These measures would have an immediate impact on the gun violence in Chicago,” Smith said. \nEarlier this year, Rep. Christian Mitchell, D-Chicago, introduced legislation to do away with the state’s cash-bond system entirely. \nUnder his bill, people charged with nonviolent offenses would be freed on their own recognizance until their cases are adjudicated. Judges would have the discretion to order detention or electronic monitoring for people accused of harming others. \nSmith described Mitchell’s measure as a “long-term solution” and Cunningham’s bill as a “short-term step” to combat gun violence. \nCunningham’s bill would have applied to about 2,600 cases in which people received bonds in gun cases last year, Smith said. \nMore than half of those defendants came up with $5,000 or more to post the required 10 percent of their bonds. About 16 percent paid $10,000 or more. And about 5 percent came up with $15,000 or more. \nOne in five defendants were able to post bond to get out of jail within 45 days of their arrest, according to the sheriff’s office. \nDart’s get-tough approach to bonds for gun cases comes as he pushes to eliminate bonds for nonviolent offenses like shoplifting. \nOn Monday, nearly 200 people who are charged with nonviolent offenses were unable to pay $1,000 or less to be released from the jail on bond, Smith said. \nThen there are the people with repeated gun arrests, like Roman, who are able to raise the money for their steep bonds. \nRoman drew the ire of then-police Supt. Garry McCarthy in 2015 after he was arrested as an alleged accomplice in the shooting of a man on the Northwest Side. \nMcCarthy pointed to Roman as a symbol of how Cook County’s justice system is soft on illegal gun possession. \nRoman, 24, was arrested twice in 2014 for having illegal guns in vehicles he was riding in. \nBoth times, he was charged with being a felon in possession of a gun and with aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. And both times, he was freed on bond. \nThe bonds were set at $250,000 and $100,000 each and Roman paid 10 percent of those totals to be released pending trial. The cases are still pending. \nIn 2015, he and a friend, Thaddeus “T.J.” Jimenez, were driving around in Jimenez’s Mercedes. Jimenez, 38, shot a man in the legs while Roman watched. A video of the shooting was captured on Roman’s cellphone. \nJimenez, who received a $25 million settlement in a wrongful conviction lawsuit against the city, used the money to build up his gang, the Simon City Royals, federal officials said. Both men were recently sentenced to federal prison on gun charges. They also face trial in Cook County Criminal Court on charges related to the 2015 shooting. Kevin Lenoir, 23, is charged with murder in the AK-47 killing of a man in Englewood in 2016. | Cook County Sheriff’s photo \nSmith pointed to another man — Kevin Lenoir — as an example of the need for legislation to allow for pretrial detention of people charged with gun crimes. \nIn March 2016, Lenoir was arrested after he allegedly tossed a loaded gun from a car during a police chase. He was charged with aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, came up with $10,500 for his bond and was released from jail. \nWhile he was still free on bond in July 2016, Lenoir was on a porch in Englewood and allegedly fired an AK-47 rifle at a man in a minivan, killing him. Lenoir, 23, is being held in the Cook County Jail without bond. He’s awaiting trial on a murder charge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T05:24:52.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
