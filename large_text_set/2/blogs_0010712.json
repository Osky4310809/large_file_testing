We met my freshman year, his senior year. We were both quiet, intellectual, artistic, and very leftist in politics. He had long hair and many comparisons were made to John Lennon and Yoko Ono, as I am an Asian-American woman with long black hair. We played music, hosted surrealist themed parties, tripped on acid, and wrote poetry by typewriter in our small apartment as incense burned and the warm air blew in through the open windows. For two years, we lived a rather bohemian lifestyle. Him, working in the organic and vegan bakery down the street, me finishing my degree and writing a novel by night. In the fall of 2015, he fell into a sort of depression due to the fact that he had graduated but done nothing of real (to his definition) value so far, while I was earning awards and scholarships for outstanding academic work. Around this time he had cut his hair into a crew-cut with the intention of being more employable. Retrospectively, this was really when his personality snapped. He began spending much of his time on Reddit, first discovering r/theredpill which is a Men’s Rights website, then discovering Million Dollar Entertainment, a production of Sam Hyde that focuses on alt-right ideas and trolling the internet. From this he discovered Breitbart, and then moved to Stormfront, a neo-Nazi publication that actively uses swastika imagery and denies that the Holocaust occurred. Around this time, an obsession with Donald Trump began to develop. He revered him and watched his primary campaign speeches with glassy eyes. He thought Trump was the epitome of manhood and what strength looks like. We had broken up shortly before Christmas of 2015 because of his new personality (his belief in a man’s superiority because of r/theredpill led him to be increasingly aggressive and downright violent towards me), but as anyone who has been emotionally and physically abused knows, it is hard to turn away from your abuser when your self-esteem has been destroyed and you think that the only love in the world that you deserve is from the abuser himself. I flew to his small Midwestern town to spend Christmas with his family. Over the first few days, he had cut his hair even shorter than before, almost to a buzzcut. I saw as we would spend quiet time reading together that the websites he was visiting had alarming imagery and attempted to confront him about it. It all came out into the open as I probed more and more into his newfound beliefs. I challenged him on an intellectual level, to debates, requiring him to back up his arguments with evidence that did not come from Breitbart or Stormfront. He could not do this. He said he would never have children with me because my Asian blood would “taint” them. He said that we would adopt white children who need a home because my genes would make our son a “beta male.” He said that if we were to get married, I wouldn’t be allowed to have a job, or ever make more money than him, because a “woman’s place is in the home.” His justification for dating a woman of Asian descent was that “Asians pull their own weight, unlike the blacks. You are the good ones.” After he said these things, I called my mother crying and flew home two hours later. At 3:30am a small plane covered in snow took off from a tiny Midwestern town, leaving behind my proudly self-proclaimed American Nazi ex boyfriend and what I thought was a sure case of mental collapse. On November 8, 2016 I watched with tears in my eyes as Donald Trump became the president-elect. My new partner, a man with politics aligned more with Bernie than Trump, who would take my last name and is proud of my professional aspirations, who wants to be a stay at home dad so I can achieve my dreams, held my hand as I watched that nation I immigrated to as a child vote for a man who represents everything I had not believed that fall of 2015. I watched America validate the nasty things that my ex said, I watched as thousands of people placed a man in power who inspires fragile men to become hateful, close minded followers. Since 45’s inauguration, I have dedicated myself to resisting against everything that the election of a neo-Nazi president stands for. I will read more, I will volunteer, I will make calls, I will fax, I will march, and I will not be quiet until our voices have been heard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:05:43.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
