In other forthcoming cookbook news: — Top Chef winner and chef Kristen Kish’s new cookbook, Kristen Kish Cooking: Recipes and Techniques , lands on shelves this fall. In it, Kish lays out 80 recipes that cover her “Korean heritage, Michigan upbringing, Boston cooking years,” and Top Chef days. The cover — with or without a jacket — looks pretty cool, too: A post shared by Meredith Erickson (@ericksonmeredith) on Jan 20, 2017 at 3:19am PST — James Beard Award-winning food writer John Birdsall has signed on to compose a new biography of one of the food world’s most prolific champions: James Beard. According to Publisher’s Marketplace (subscription req’d) James Beard: The Man Who Ate Too Much will be “a reassessment of James Beard's life, chronicling how the failed actor turned caterer became such a widely-read food personality and author, tracing how Beard's personal call for a return to America's natural bounty and an embrace of pleasure in cooking and eating brought cuisine into culture, and in the process constructed what we understand as ‘American Food.’” The book does not yet have a release date. — The Art of Flavor: Practices and Principles for Creating Delicious Food is SF-based chef Daniel Patterson’s new book, which he co-wrote with noted perfumer and author Mandy Aftel . In 60 recipes and nearly 300 pages Patterson and Aftel champion the idea that “foods in their natural state are infinitely more nuanced than the laboratory can replicate — and offer far greater possibilities for deliciousness.” The authors outline “four basic rules” for coaxing flavor out of food, using scent as a guide. The book will be available this summer, on August 1. — Finally, Atlanta-based chef, restaurateur, and some time TV personality Hugh Acheson is writing another cookbook. Called The Chef and the Slow Cooker , it will feature photographs by Andrew Thomas Lee when it hits shelves on October 17, 2017.
