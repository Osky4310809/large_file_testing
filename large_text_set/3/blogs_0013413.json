The team and Aurora officials have been working since early 2016 on plans for the development on a portion of the 21,000-acre Aerotropolis project planned south of Denver International Airport. \nAmy Larson, spokeswoman for Aurora Highlands, said the developers’ vision for project is a full, multi-use, master planned community that will eventually cover 5,000-acres between E-470 on the west side, Powhaton Road on the east and 26th Avenue to the south and 56th Avenue to the north. \n“We’re currently planning for about 23,000 homes, which we’re estimating will eventually be home to about 60,000 residents,” Larson said. “In addition to that there will be a corporate campus, a medical campus, retail space, class-A office space and additional commercial space. There will also be a variety of parks and open space and the biking and hiking trails and green space that we all love.” \nPlans for Aurora Highlands include affordable housing units among the multi-family and single family homes, tentatively prices from $200,000 to more than $1 million. Early plans include a main entryway to the community marked with a large monument. \nThe principals of Aurora Highlands have successfully developed a combined total of nearly 100,000 homes throughout the Southwest, according to a news release. One of the developers, Carlo Ferriera, helped create a 3,500-acre community outside Houston called Shadow Creek Ranch. \nThe Aurora Highlands vision will be similar to Shadow Creek Ranch , and will include amenities like recreation centers, open space and park as well as a downtown district with retail, restaurants, entertainment and office space developments.
