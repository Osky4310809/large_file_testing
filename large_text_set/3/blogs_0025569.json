That is today what we are taking forward. \n“The very positive announcement of allowing couples who are desiring to have a family to get access to three cycles has been welcomed across the different fertility organisations.” \nThe Scottish National party minister said money had been “put aside” to fund the IVF programme. \nAsked how she squared this with other demands on funding in the Scottish NHS, she said: “We have got a fairly strong record across Scotland on our NHS. Some of our A&Es have outperformed the lion’s share of England’s A&Es. \n“We are outperforming A&Es across the UK and have done for some months. We have good investment levels in the NHS and we have record numbers of staff. \n“We have got a commitment to our NHS that we will invest more money in our NHS than any of the other parties that stood in the election.” \nFrom 1 April, new patients referred for IVF treatment may be eligible for three full cycles rather than two, after the change was recommended to ministers by the National Infertility Group last year . \nCampbell said: “We want to make access to treatment on the NHS as fair as possible – giving more people the opportunity to conceive. Over the last five years we have invested around £24m to reduce IVF waiting times and improve the outcomes for couples. These changes make NHS IVF access in Scotland by far the fairest and most generous in the UK.” \nScottish Labour’s health spokesman, Anas Sarwar, said: “Scottish Labour argued in its manifesto for an increase in the number of full cycles of IVF available to couples from two to three. This is a very welcome and long-overdue announcement from the Scottish government.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:48:07.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
