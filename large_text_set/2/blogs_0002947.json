Edelman stayed with the pass after Falcons rookie Robert Alford tipped the pass up into the air, diving at the ball as it fell to the turf. \nAs Alford fell backward and Edelman dove for the ball, he somehow outfought two more Atlanta Falcons defenders and got his hands under the biggest catch in Super bowl history. He then readjusted his grip on the ball to secure the catch before it ever touched the NRG Stadium turf.\nOH MY WORD EDELMAN pic.twitter.com/7mITmFmayY \n— Maria Martin (@Ria_Martin) February 6, 2017 \n\nHow?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:14:45.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
