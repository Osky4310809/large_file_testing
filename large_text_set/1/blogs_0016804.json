Looks like Samsung is keeping its promise to release the Android 7.0 Nougat update to its flagship devices on January 17. The South Korean giant is already rolling out the update to users in China and the UK – to all users, not just those who have signed up for the company’s Nougat beta program. We do, however, expect that the update will soon be rolling out to users in other countries as well.\nThe update weighs in at around 1.2 GB and obviously brings a bunch of new features to the devices. According to the official changelog, these include a new UX and various performance modes, improved usability of the Notification feature and Quick Settings button, improved usability of the Multi-window feature, and much more.\nSee also: Android Nougat update: when will you get it? 5 days ago The update should keep you busy for a while as there are a lot of new things to test out, which is always fun, isn’t it?
