As # GlobalCitizens , we can make our voices heard and turn awareness into meaningful action and positive change. # WomensMarch .” \nBeyoncé’s sister Solange will be performing on January 19 at a non-partisan alternative to the Inauguration Ball, called the Peace Ball, to take place in the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC. Guests for the event, which is to “celebrate the accomplishments and successes of the past 4 years and the vow to continue to be the change we want to see in the world,” include Esperanza Spalding, activist Angela Davis, and The Color Purple author Alice Walker. \nFor those wishing to protest in Los Angeles, Prophets Of Rage (featuring Chuck D and B-Real), Vic Mensa, Audioslave and Jackson Browne are playing an Anti-Inauguration Ball at the Teragram Ballroom on Friday, January 20. \n“The Anti-Inaugural Ball is a celebration of resistance,” said Prophets Of Rage/Rage Against The Machine member Tom Morello in a statement published on Billboard . “Resistance to racism. Resistance to sexism. Resistance to homophobia. Resistance to bullying. Resistance to environmental devastation. Resistance to fascism. Resistance to Donald Trump.” \nAs the musicians-against-Trump movement continues to pick up members (bands like The National and Sleater-Kinney will also be performing at the Women’s March after-party on January 21), Trump himself is struggling to put together a viable entertainment line-up for his Inauguration Ball. \nThe latest artist to sign on to perform for Trump is former Motown artist Chrisette Michele, who suffered a major backlash on Twitter once fans found out.
