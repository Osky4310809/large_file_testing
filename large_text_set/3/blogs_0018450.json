The guys answer your tweets on where Alexis Sanchez will end up, how Neymar's abscence affected Barca, and the FA Cup. Barcelona boss Luis Enrique had an unusual problem to deal with in a recent press conference, a sleeping journalist! PSG boss Unai Emery says the joy of winning another Ligue 1 title will help the team recover from their loss to Barcelona. Lionel Messi scored twice as Barcelona took advantage of the extra man to best Valencia at Camp Nou. \nNeymar has dropped the biggest hint yet that he could play in the Premier League one day if he ever decides to leave Barcelona for new pastures. \nThe Brazil international is enjoying his fourth season at Barca since joining from Santos in 2013 and signed a new five-year-deal at the end of last year . \nPrior to committing his future to the Catalan club he had been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain and he even admitted that he had listened to what the French champions had to say last summer. \nAnd even since penning new terms at Camp Nou, there continued to be talk of a potential move to England, with Diario Sport reporting last month that Jose Mourinho has been personally phoning him in an attempt to get him to move to Manchester United. \n\"I like the playing style and the teams,\" Neymar told The Sun at a sponsorship event, when asked about the possibility of a move to the Premier League. \"And who knows, someday, I would like to play at it, yes. \n\"I admire Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool -- these are the teams that are always there fighting. \n\"And then you have high-level coaches like Mourinho and [Manchester City's Pep] Guardiola. These are coaches with whom any player would like to work.\" Neymar says he admires the style of football in England's Premier League. \nNeymar, 25, also admitted the unpredictability and competitiveness of England's top flight is a big draw. \n\"In the Premier League you never know who is going to win or who will be champions, it is always a surprise,\" he said speaking before Friday's Champions League draw, which included last season's title winners Leicester City. \n\"Leicester are very good. They had a great season last year, they were Prem champions and therefore we need to respect them if we draw them in the Champions League.\" \nHowever, Neymar is not thought to be looking to flee Barcelona anytime soon, even if there is uncertainty about who will be in charge of the club next season after Luis Enrique confirmed he will not extend his contract beyond June. \nHe starred in the recent comeback over PSG in the Champions League, scoring twice and creating the winner in an enthralling ending to the tie, and has spoken about how happy he is in Catalonia. \nSince signing four years ago, he has scored 99 goals and won seven trophies, including two La Liga titles and the Champions League. \nSamuel Marsden covers Barcelona for ESPN FC.
