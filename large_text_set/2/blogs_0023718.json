Try to walk around as much as you can, although auto rickshaws are readily available to provide transport from the bus or train station to either of the bridges. Make sure you watch out for the plentiful monkeys which make quite a menace of themselves, particularly on the bridges. Side Trips \nShivpuri is a highly recommended side trip, especially if you're into adventure. Located 22 kilometers (14 miles) upstream, it's a place of mesmerizing natural beauty. You'll find excellent white water rafting there, with Grade 3 and 4 rapids.
