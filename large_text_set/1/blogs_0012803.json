Florida Atlantic won the game 79-77. (Photo: Joseph Maiorana, USA TODAY Sports) \nIn light of Friday's mass shooting at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, the Florida Atlantic men's basketball team has adjusted its travel regimen because the coaches and players fly commercially from the airport to face opponents in Conference USA play. \nThey (the football team uses a charter jet) also frequently use Delta Airlines — located in Fort Lauderdale's Terminal 2 — which is where Esteban Santiago allegedly pulled a gun from his suitcase and opened fire on a crowd of travelers in baggage claim, killing five and wounding six. \nThe biggest change is keeping the team together upon landing in an airport and keeping players in a secured area while airport staff brings the checked bags to the team's bus. \n“I think it’s the right thing ... so that (the players) can talk to their families because I’m sure their families were going to have questions,” FAU coach Michael Curry told FAUOwlAccess . No vigils, public memorials found after Florida airport shooting \nPlayers also will not be able to wear headphones in airports as a safety precaution. \n“I just want everybody to always be conscious and aware of what is going on around them,” Curry added to FAUOwlAccess . \nFAU (5-9, 1-2 in C-USA) plays at Texas-San Antonio on Thursday. The university's campus is located in Boca Raton, Fla. \nHIGHLIGHTS: BEST ACTION IN COLLEGE HOOPS THIS WEEK Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
