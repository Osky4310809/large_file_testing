It’s the UK debut if you like for the official Liverpool Legends team. The Bernabeu was the first game a couple of years ago and then we played Manchester United in Stockholm, so this is the first at Anfield as well. \n“All the signs are really positive. We’re going to have a sold-out stadium, like the All-stars game a couple of years back, but of course with an even bigger stadium now. \n”It’s one of those projects where everybody wins really. The players absolutely love it, they really want to play, to wear the shirt again, to play in front of the new Main Stand for the first time, to see each other again, to have a reunion and share the old stories, and of course just to play a game, maybe score a goal.

This year they include Alder Hey hospital, a University of Liverpool project to help improve the number of children from the Anfield area entering higher education and a Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine project to use the club to help encourage people to access health support. \nSteve McManaman is set to repeat his feat of of playing for both sides, as he did in the Bernabeu, having represented both during his career, while Michael Owen may well do the same. \nAlso turning out for Liverpool include Patrik Berger, Dietmar Hamann, Jerzy Dudek, Stephane Henchoz, John Arne Riise, Jason McAteer, Vladimir Smicer, David Thompson, Bjorn Tore Kvarme, Sander Westerveld, Salif Diao and Phil Babb, poll loading Did Steven Gerrard retire too early? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:46:45.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
