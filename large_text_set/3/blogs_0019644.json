Trump had allocated $19.1 billion for NASA in his budget, which is slightly down from the current year, but still an improvement from the past decade, which saw the end of the space shuttle program. \nThe commander in chief signed the bill surrounded by astronauts and his former Republican rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who both sponsored the bill. \nGetting to Mars, though, isn't expected to happen during the Trump presidency. NASA has its sights set on getting to the red planet in the 2030s. \nRelated: Elon Musk Makes His Case for Colonizing Mars \nNASA laid out its plan for Mars in a 36-page report, detailing milestones the space agency must hit over the next few years to help ensure a successful future trek into deep space. \nIn the near term, NASA plans to test its Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket, in addition to visiting an asteroid and redirecting a chunk of it into orbit around the moon. Astronauts could later visit the boulder and use the mission to test some of the tools needed for a Mars mission. \nThe president tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that he was honored to support NASA's \"pursuit of discovery.\" Honored to sign S.442 today. With this legislation, we support @NASA 's scientists, engineers, and astronauts in their pursuit of discovery! pic.twitter.com/9W37qQ0GVf â€” Donald J.
