It's a natural effect of growing up, especially when you both want to pursue a similar career. \nAnthony Martial seemed to outshine his older brother Johan when he signed for Manchester United for £36 million and lifted the Golden Boy trophy. \nThe baffling mystery of Thomas Muller \nHowever, the forward's second season at Old Trafford has failed to live up to the first - and now he may have to look to Johan for inspiration on how to re-find his scoring touch. \nThe older Martial is a defender at Ligue 2 side Troyes, and bagged his second and third league goals of the season on Tuesday night to give himself an enviable record against his brother. #MUFC striker Anthony Martial has a worse goals-per-min ratio (356) this season than bro Johan (279). Johan is a centre-back @estac_officiel — Robin Bairner (@RBairner) February 7, 2017 \nBy netting twice in Troyes' 4-0 win over Strasbourg, Johan Martial brought his goals-per-minute ratio in front of his brother, who has struggled in front of goal this campaign. \nThe United forward has just two goals in 13 league appearances for Jose Mourinho's side, a vast drop from his 11-goal return in his debut Premier League season.
