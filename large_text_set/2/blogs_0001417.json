Abbi Holland playing dress ups in hospital (Photo: MEN) \n“It’s an eye opener, that something so small and simple could be life changing.” \nHe explained that Abbi was treated in 2013 at North Manchester General Hospital (NMGH). \nBut she was transferred to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital for scans which revealed the infection from the cut had caused her aortic valve to leak.

Abbi Holland (Photo: MEN) \nDave added: “To be told that they are going to have to stop your little girl’s heart and there’s no guarantee they will be able to start it again is terrifying. \n“Then to hear that if they did manage to there was a chance she could be brain damaged – well you wouldn’t wish that on your worst enemy. \n“We are not trying to bad mouth or blacklist anyone, we just want to promote basic first aid and get the message out about how important it is.
