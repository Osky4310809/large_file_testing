The album is filled with rousing sing-along moments perfect for the family trip (“Belle,” “Gaston,” and “Be Our Guest”) or when you need some alone time in the driveway (“How Does a Moment Last Forever” and “Evermore”). Customer Reviews Review of Beauty and the Beast Single Only by Katie Jay I must admit, I have been incredibly excited ever since this movie remake was initially announced, even more so when I found out that Emma Watson would be portraying Belle. However, I must also admit that I was disappointed upon hearing that Ariana Grande and John Legend would be singing the iconic Beauty and the Beast duet. I am personally not a fan of Ariana Grande, but I decided to withhold judgment until the single was released. Upon hearing the song in the final movie trailer that aired earlier this week, I was hopeful. Their voices sounded beautiful and it seemed that they had surpassed my expectations. Unfortunately, upon hearing the single, I am even more disappointed than I initially thought I would be. This is an epic BALLAD, which deserves authentic instruments as opposed to electronic keyboards and overly-produced, digital instruments. Frankly, this is not a pop song, and its disappointing that they treated it as such. Beauty and the Beast deserved better than this. Disappointed by Libramoon56 I was expecting a beautiful ballad for a beautiful Disney classic. The one from the trailer sounded so much better. Why didn't you release that one? This track sounds like it came off of a karaoke machine. The original is so much better. Why? by glink123 Throw two flavors of the week into a recording room with a beat-box, and 30 minutes later, you end up with this mess. Disney deserves better. They ruined this song.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T07:05:49.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
