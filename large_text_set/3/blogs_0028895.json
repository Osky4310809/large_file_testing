Krejci has yet to miss a game this season. \nQUICK START Patrice Bergeron opened the scoring for the B’s with a goal at 2:28 of the first period. The Bruins center crashed the net and buried a rebound off a Zdeno Chara shot for his 18th goal of the season.

Pastrnak made a sweet pass to Krejci entering the attacking zone to complete a give-and-go that ended with the B’s center scoring his 22nd goal of the campaign. Drew Stafford also picked up an assist on the goal, which was tallied at 13:52 of the first period.

Bruins forward Noel Acciari scored his first NHL goal at 15:57 of the third period. It was an important one, too, as it gave the Bruins a 3-1 lead less than four minutes after Predators forward Craig Smith cut Boston’s lead in half with a goal of his own. Riley Nash picked up the assist on Acciari’s goal, giving him a three-game point streak (five total points in that span).

The only goal he allowed came on a redirect at the edge of the crease. \nUP NEXT The Bruins host Tyler Seguin and the Dallas Stars on Thursday night at TD Garden. Puck drop is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET. \nThumbnail photo via Winslow Townson/USA TODAY Sports Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:22:26.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
