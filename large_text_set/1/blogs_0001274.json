The airport said traffic was heavy coming into the departures level.\nIn Atlanta, CBP public affairs officer Robert Brisley says the outage at the city’s airport lasted about an hour from late afternoon into early evening. He said that officers were working to recover quickly afterward but even short outages can lead to backups at the airport, one of the world’s busiest.\nHe said the agency apologizes to travelers who were delayed getting into the country after long flights.\nBrisley said the cause of the outage was still being evaluated.\n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
