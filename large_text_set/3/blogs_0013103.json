Unfortunately, it seems nobody listened, as it proved to be a big hit—big enough, it seems, to have earned the show a second season of maddeningly depressing situations for the poor Baudelaire orphans.\nSnicket—who, in the series, chronicles the Baudelaire’s plights—penned a letter, which Netflix shared to break the news to everyone.\nWe hope you’re happy. Because you won’t be, ever again. #ASOUE Season 2. pic.twitter.com/MlXpqqs2dJ \n— Netflix US (@netflix) March 13, 2017 \nChilling, no?\nI confess: watching through the series on Netflix brought out the worst kinds of depressing, nihilistic feelings in me. If these kids can’t be happy, then can anyone truly be ?! Sigh. But in the same way that, say, hot sauce causes all kinds of pain in order to trigger an endorphin rush, or how sour candy is only sour for a moment, the show found its way into my heart with its sweet, tender core. You know, despite that core being surrounded entirely by thorns and henchpeople with hooked hands.\nI know I’ll be tuning in when the show comes back.
