Nawar al-Awlaki (Nora): 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published Updated 7:56 pm EDT, February 1, 2017 3 Comments By Jessica McBride 9.2k Share Tweet Follow \nAn 8-year-old American girl was reportedly killed in Donald Trump’s first approved clandestine operation against Al-Qaeda in Yemen, according to NBC News. \nNawar al-Awlaki, sometimes called Nora, the daughter of an American-born Al-Qaeda leader assassinated by the United States several years ago, was slain in the U.S. operation that also killed a Navy Seal, the network reported. \nOther news organizations had attributed claims of the girl’s death to her grandfather. NBC News reported that a “senior military official” the network did not name had confirmed the child’s death. The New York Times reported that U.S. officials denied there were civilian casualties but then said they were “assessing reports that women and children” had died. \nAlso killed in the raid targeting Al-Qaeda militants was American Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens. He was a member of the famed SEAL Team 6. Owens was the first U.S. combat death under President Trump. \nHeavy asked the Department of Defense, “Is it true that another American citizen died in that incident also? Who? And what age? Is it true that an 8-year-old American citizen, Nawar al-Alwaki, was killed in the incident? Was she killed by the Americans, Al-Qaeda or in another manner? How did she die?” \nChristopher Sherwood, a Department of Defense spokesman, responded, “We take all civilian casualty reports seriously. As is CENTCOM’s policy, they are looking into the civilian casualty claims and will make a determination on if there needs to be a full investigation.” \nThe military has now released a statement saying that it’s likely civilian casualties resulted from the raid, including possibly children.

Hennigan (@wjhenn) February 2, 2017 \nThe child’s father, Anwar al-Awlaki, was born in New Mexico but became a high-profile leader of Al-Qaeda. \nHere’s what you need to know: 1. Nawar’s Father & Teenage Brother Were Previously Killed by the Americans \nThe child’s grandfather claimed that she “was hit with a bullet in her neck and suffered for two hours,” according to the Christian Science Monitor. \nThe grandfather, Nasser al-Awlaki, told Reuters: “Why kill children? This is the new (US) administration – it’s very sad, a big crime.” \nThe United States, upon the order of President Barack Obama, killed the girl’s father with a drone in 2011. Her father, Anwar al-Awlaki, was a New Mexico born cleric who was the top Al-Qaeda leader in Yemen, according to The New York Times. The Times reported that his brother-in-law, also an Al-Qaeda leader, was believed killed in the recent raid. \nNawar’s 16-year-old brother, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, also an American citizen, was then killed in another drone strike also authorized by Obama, according to the Atlantic. \nThe recent operation was planned for months, before Trump took office, but he authorized it, according to KTLA. \nThe Times reported that a Yemeni official contends seven children died in the recent raid, but this was not confirmed. 2. The Raid Was Supposed to Obtain Intelligence, Such as Computer Equipment, but Things ‘Went Wrong’ (Getty) \nThe raid was targeting a powerful family associated with Al-Qaeda terrorist, Abdulraoof al-Dhahab. KTLA reported that the raid was “against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula headquarters.” According to The New York Times, a “fierce firefight” erupted in the raid, which was part of the “yearslong shadow war against Al-Qaeda’s “Yemen affiliate.” \nThe Times reported that the goal was to obtain computer planning intelligence of plots against America in the targeted Al-Qaeda home. \n“Almost everything went wrong,” NBC News quoted the unnamed official of the botched raid, which was overshadowed by the protests and controversies over Trump’s immigration ban. \nAccording to Reuters , accounts of the dead and injured conflicted. \nThe U.S. military claimed 14 militants were killed, but medics present “said around 30 people, including 10 women and children, were killed,” Reuters reported. \nAt least two other U.S. service members were injured, and a military aircraft had to be purposely destroyed, Reuters reported. 3. Owens, Killed During a Firefight on the Ground, Was a Decorated SEAL 🇺🇸 Navy SEAL killed in a raid on Al Qaeda identified as Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owen https://t.co/lw2cypnAkE 👈 see here 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/0x84gyqjKN \n— American Girl Thinks (@usa_news_24) January 31, 2017 \nOwens, 36, of Peoria, Illinois, was a “decorated Navy SEAL from the Virginia-based elite unit known as SEAL Team 6,” according to the San Diego Union Tribune . \nThe newspaper said the SEAL “was twice awarded the Bronze Star medal with V for valor in combat.” According to the Union-Tribune, Al-Qaeda women were among the fighters the SEALS faced. \nThe gun battle that killed Owens lasted for two hours, reported the San Diego Union-Tribune. Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, went to meet Owens’ body as he arrived back on American soil.
