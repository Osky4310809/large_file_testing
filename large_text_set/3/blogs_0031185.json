Getty Images 4 Olivier Giroud is out of favour at the Emirates \nAnd while Giroud failed to score his two other Group A appearances for Les Bleus, Deschamps justified selecting him when he produced the goods yesterday. \nAfter being told by a reporter that he was right to keep faith in Giroud, Dechamps said: “Thank you, but that is his merit and I will not take it off him.
