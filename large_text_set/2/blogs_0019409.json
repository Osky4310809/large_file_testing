(Chris Pizzello, The Associated Press) \nIs there anything sadder than a shmear-less bagel? Lisa Edelstein doesn’t think so, and the vegetarian actress — best known for her roles on “House” and “Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce”— isn’t gonna take it anymore. In a letter sent on PETA’s behalf to the CEO and president of Colorado-based Einstein Bros. Bagels, Mike Tattersfield, Edelstein pleads her case for a vegan shmear: \n“There are few things I enjoy more than a good bagel in the morning — or any time of the day, really. That’s why I’m writing to you today urging you to consider adding vegan cream cheese options to your menus so that people who can’t — or won’t — consume dairy foods might still be able to enjoy a good bagel with shmear at your many establishments.” \nFor the love of God, can someone get that woman a bagel with shmear? All she wants is a vegan pumpernickel bagel with non-dairy cream cheese. That’s it. She doesn’t want hummus. (Who would want hummus?) She wants what every other red-blooded, bagel-loving American wants: shmear. \nIn the letter, Edelstein highlights plant-based cream cheeses in grocery store aisles, as well as dairy-free options at fast-casual competitors Chipotle Mexican Grill and Moe’s Southwest Grill. \n“The time is ripe for vegan cream cheese … I hope your brands will soon join others in meeting the demand for exciting plant-based menu items,” she wrote. \nDid you hear that, Einstein Bros.? These are exciting times we’re living in! This very well may be the golden age of plant-based menu items. Get with it. GET LISA EDELSTEIN HER SHMEAR! #Veganshmearforlisa Bagels, just waiting to be shmeared.
