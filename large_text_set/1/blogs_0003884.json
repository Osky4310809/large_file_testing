While we love to cover all aspects of pop and geek culture, our roots lie in the comics community and the plethora of characters and stories that have sprung from it. If you speak with anyone in the comics community about what has made the medium successful in North America, you’ll quickly discover one answer that stands far above the rest: local comics stores. They are the bedrock of comics in the United States and Canada, supporting fans, communities, and conventions with open doors and a dedicated staff. \nThis year on ComicBook.Com we are highlighting this important aspect of comics and culture by taking a look at one local comic store each week. These are stores that embody what it means to support culture and community. We hope you can visit some of them throughout 2017. \n\nOutsiders may wonder why the word “collection” is repeated on the storefront of Space Cadets Collection Collection in North Houston. Store owner Jen King says that it’s because a store like hers relies on collecting collections. Comics and gaming stores service such a wide array of interests and hobbies that it’s integral to her model that they have a different sort of collection for everyone to look through. King has been collecting something unexpected across the past few decades of running Space Cadets as well: people. \nThat’s not surprising if you speak with King though. She says the purpose of her store has not changed since it opened in 1995, simply put, it’s “to be a place where everyone felt comfortable and valued.” You can see the success of that goal in the many customers the store attracts today. Its clientele is evenly split between men and women. Men come from all ranges of age, but the women who come to the store for comics trend younger, between pre-adolescence and college, typically. \nThat speaks to a trend within comics as an industry too. During the boom of the 1990s in which Space Cadets was opened, most readers were male, and so was the readership that first visited the store. King suggests that many women may have stuck to mail order comics at this time, but it’s difficult to say. The slow shift towards more even demographics inside the store speaks to the hard work of building an accepting storefront and culture in which everyone can enjoy their hobbies. \nWhile King may not have been the first female comics store owner in the United States, she was certainly one of the first. Starting out at only the age of 25 and in Midland, Texas , King’s passions were as important as her ambitions. The very first day at her first store, her total sales were only $12, but she went home smiling. King says, “I was living the dream and still am.” \nSince that first day things have changed a lot for both King and Space Cadets. The store has moved across the state of Texas and become considerably more successful. It’s now a staple in its community and among comics retailers. King is known as someone who is dedicated to her work and willing to experiment with new ideas. \nClick ahead to read more about Space Cadets and why some consider Jen King to be \"half crazy\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:08:15.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
