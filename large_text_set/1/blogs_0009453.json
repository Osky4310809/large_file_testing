By using it, you can control certain functions of your device with your voice and save a bit of time in the process.\nBut Google’s Assistant is not without faults. Although it can continue a conversation based on context, you still have to activate it by saying “OK Google” before you ask a question, which can get annoying after a while and just makes the experience unnatural.\nSee also: Nvidia’s new Shield TV brings 4K HDR, Google Assistant, and smart home features 4 days ago It looks like Google is aware of this issue and is making a few changes that will improve how Assistant works. Well, at least on Android TV. According to a video posted online by Android Police , Google’s Assistant on Android TV supports continuous conversation mode. What this means is that after you get a response to your question, Assistant will keep listening for a little while just in case you want to ask it something else. If you want to continue the conversation, you can ask whatever you’re interested in without activating the voice assistant first by saying “OK Google”.\n\nThe feature really does make a difference if you’re using Assistant on a daily basis. That’s why we would love to see it on other Assistant enabled devices including the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones and Google Home . Unfortunately, Google hasn’t commented regarding this topic yet so, for now, all we can do is wait and hope that the online search giant will eventually bring the feature to other tech gadgets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T12:34:39.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
