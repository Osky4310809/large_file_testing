And we’re here to scoop it all up.\nThat’s right, she’s dropping handy pieces of movie trivia! In Watson’s latest post, she mentions being in Paris for the first leg of the tour, and then tells us some pretty cool (yet random) trivia about the movie’s French translation. And it has to do with two of our most favorite characters: Lumiere’s lovable sidekick Cogsworth …\nvia GIPHY And Belle’s sweet horse Philippe!\nvia GIPHY “Did you know in the French version of the film, Cogsworth is called Big Ben? And Philippe is called Philbert?!” she wrote in her Insta post. \nBig Ben refers to the giant clock tower in London, so that’s pretty appropriate. And Philbert is just…oh-so-cute.\n\nIncidentally, if you haven’t seen any other versions of Beauty and the Beast (not including the animated one from our childhoods, of course!), they’re totally worth checking out. The story has been filmed many times in various languages and interpretations, and the 2014 French version starred a familiar face from the James Bond movie Spectre , Léa Seydoux. Hmmm…movie marathon, anyone?\nHere’s Watson’s whole Insta post, which also breaks down all the eco-friendly items she’s wearing (even down to her makeup):\nMerci beaucoup Paris for the wonderful start to the @beautyandthebeast tour! We felt like we were back in the heart of the film. Next stop - London. Did you know in the French version of the film, Cogsworth is called Big Ben? And Philippe is called Philbert?!
