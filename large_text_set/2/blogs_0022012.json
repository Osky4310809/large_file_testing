Marvel’s Inhumans series is set to premiere in September and we haven’t heard much about it besides basic premise details. But now we’ve finally gotten word of the first confirmed cast member.\nIwan Rheon, who recently had a rough time with some dogs on Game of Thrones , has been cast in Marvel’s Inhumans drama\n“Iwan’s ability to be charming, roguish and still completely unexpectedly dangerous were all the different sides we needed to bring the character to life. We’re thrilled to have him on board,” Marvel TV head Jeph Loeb said.\nThe transition makes sense, especially now that Rheon isn’t tied to Game of Thrones anymore (spoilers?). The actor played Ramsay Bolton for four seasons, straddling the line between comically sadistic, especially in those earlier seasons, and just normal, uncomfortable sadistic. Ramsay is a one-note bad guy, only focusing on how far he’d go to be evil, and Rheon was able to give him more dimension.\n(The clip below is NSFW).\nThe thinking is that Rheon will bring the same ambiguity and complexity to Maximus, who will most likely function as the series’ villain. In the comics, Maximus is an inhuman who tries multiple times to stage a coup against Black Bolt, his brother, and the rest of the Royal Family. Like his brother, he is also incredibly powerful, possessing mind powers that allow him to control others. He’s also an extremely smart inventor, giving him multiple avenues to try and bring down the king.\n“Maximus is a complex character. Likable, charming, tragic and villainous all in the same moment, and I’m very excited to have someone of Iwan’s considerable talent,” said Scott Buck, who is writing and executive producing the show.\n\nWe’re excited too. Ramsay might’ve been a boring villain in the grand scheme of the Game of Thrones universe, but Rheon has a lot of range. We first fell in love with him as the awkward Simon Bellamy in Misfits , where he transformed from a socially uncomfortable teen to a dashing, confident hero.\nInhumans is a new live-action series from Marvel based on Black Bolt and the Royal Family. The twist here is that Marvel is teaming up with IMAX to distribute the first two episodes in theaters for two weeks in September 2017. The episodes will then air on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:47:49.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
