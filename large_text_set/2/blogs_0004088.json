Monday: Arrive Heathrow, economy class. Get taxi to Premier Inn in Euston. Spend afternoon shopping at Harrods. Have a Not-So-Happy Meal with Theresa May at McDonald’s. Tuesday: two hour guided tour of London, taking in views of Buckingham Palace and Houses of Parliament. Lunch with Nigel Farage and his French au pair at a pub in Chelsea. Watch them get pissed before taking them to see Brexit: The Musical. Wednesday: Stay indoors and tweet about BAD PEOPLE! TV dinner with Piers Morgan to watch repeats of the American Apprentice. Thursday: Check waxwork likeness at Madame Tussauds. Go home. \nThis wasn’t quite what Theresa May envisaged when she let the President of the United States caress her hand at the White House 10 days ago. Then, the idea of inviting The Donald for a full state visit had seemed like a masterstroke of diplomacy. A chance to make her look a player on the global stage at a time when all the EU leaders were giving her the cold shoulder . It hadn’t been easy explaining to the president just what an honour she was offering, but once she had showed him some old photos of the gold carriage he had wanted to talk of little else. Even if his priapism was a little off-putting. And now his — and her — dreams were in tatters. \nIt had all looked to be business as usual when the prime minister had gone to the house to make a statement about the informal European Council meeting in Malta the previous weekend. Theresa had had to skirt over the fact that she had been pretty much ignored by everyone — Angela Merkel had only spoken to her for a couple of minutes as they queued for the toilet — but she was getting used to creating her own FAKE NEWS ! Maybe the president’s narcissism was contagious. Her advisers had managed to rewrite her 20 minutes in Valetta as a personal triumph and who was she to disagree? \nEverything changed with a point of order from Labour’s Stephen Doughty about an early day motion objecting to the possibility of Trump being invited to give a speech in Westminster Hall. The speaker sighed before rising. It was a shame the prime minister hadn’t stayed to hear his ruling but she’d hear about it soon enough. He’d never much liked her; she had always treated him like dirt and now was as good a time as any to exact revenge. Besides, if the Labour party wasn’t going to offer much by way of opposition, he might as well do so. \n“We value our relationship with the United States. If a state visit takes place, that is way beyond beyond and above the pay grade of the Speaker,” he began. \n“However, as far as this place is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons .” \nHaving given Theresa’s special relationship a good kicking, he went on to slit its throat. As one of the three people needed to give a Westminster Hall speech the go ahead he was putting it on record that he would make sure no invitation would be extended . And, though he had less clout when it came to what went on in the Royal Gallery, he would do everything in his power from letting The Donald shoot his mouth off there either. \nBercow sat down to loud cheers from the opposition benches. Even Diane Abbott, who had risen from her death bed to drag herself in to Westminster, managed to join in the applause. The Tories looked on in silence, scarcely able to believe what they had just heard. They weren’t used to being challenged. The speaker hadn’t spoken for them. They had been quite happy to condone a little bit of light racism and sexism if it got Britain a better trade deal. Now it was all in danger of going tits up. If Bercow could unilaterally put the kibosh on the president speaking in parliament, imagine what would happen if the queen chose to throw a sickie.
