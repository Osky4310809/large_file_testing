In some cases, it is a case of back log of salaries running into months. These unfortunate and condemnable developments are blamed on shortfall in and non-release of subvention from governments. \n“In University of Benin and Federal University of Petroleum Resources, FUPR, Ogbomoro, Warri, the two federal Universities in Benin Zone, the shortfall is such that government is only able to meet about 80 percent of monthly salary.” \n“The state Universities in the zone are worst off. In Ondo State University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, the staff of the institution have been without salary for six months. In the same Ondo State, the older University, Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, salary is in arrear of five months, March will make it six. \n“ hese developments are unacceptable especially given the current harsh economic climate and also considering that the salary in question is a product of collective bargaining. They amount to unilateral cut in and seizure of salary and breaches of the outcome of collective bargaining process that midwifed the 2009 FGN/ASUU agreement. So after 14 days if our demands are not met we will embark on a strike action,” he stated.
