Cuomo’s proposed budget has $4.3 billion in 60 discretionary funding pots, up $2 billion last year.\nThe group said the budget includes another $9.5 billion for economic development with little or no oversight.\nCitizens Union director Dick Dadey charged that the system is ripe for corruption.\n“We first stumbled upon this when Malcolm Smith was charged with accessing these funds,” Dadey said, a reference to the former Queens state senator who was convicted of corruption .\n“Then as we know, Shelly Silver and his conviction was due in part to accessing a very similar pot of money from many years ago and of course Dean Skelos’ access to these as well as Majority Leader.”\nSilver, the former Assembly speaker, was also charged and convicted of corruption, as was Skelos, the one-time state Senate majority leader.\n“We have a crime wave of corruption,” said Dadey.\nThe watchdog group is calling on lawmakers to identify all lump sum funds in the budget, explain their purpose and how decisions are made about doling out the funds.\nThe Assembly and Senate have both proposed increased disclosure and transparency for the state’s economic development initiatives. Those proposals are being negotiated as part of the state budget which is due by April 1.\nThe governor’s office said all the spending is subject to rigorous agency review and contingency funds are necessary because the state can’t predict all expenses ahead of time. \nCuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi also criticized Citizens Union for demanding transparency from the state while refusing to release its list of donors.\n“Dadey and his patrons issued the same tired report last year and the only difference now is they are hypocrites for preaching transparency while suing to keep their own donors secret,” said Azzopardi.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:28:56.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
