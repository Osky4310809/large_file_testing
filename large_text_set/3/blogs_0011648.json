Pinnick Amaju \n“First things first, I want to see Nigerian referees getting considerations in officiating in top CAF competitions and most importantly, officiating at the World Cup”, the NFF President said. \nNigerian referees have become outcasts in CAF competitions but Pinnick said their relegation was not borne out of incompetence but out of dirty politics of not having anybody to put in words for them. \n“With all sense of modesty, Nigerian referees are among the best in Africa. The time has come for a Nigerian to officiate at the global stage, which is the World Cup”. Pinnick also said that his victory at the polls would also see a Nigerian work at the CAF headquarters in Egypt. \nPinnick played a prominent role to see that African football wears a garb of change in mobilizing other like-minded Africans in overthrowing Issa Hayatou, 71, who ruled CAF with a tight grip for 29 years. \n“It is not going to be about Nigerian interests. Together with a listening and pragmatic CAF President, Ahmad and other Executive members, we’re going to bring positive changes to African football”. \nThe NFF President, who was hailed by other African administrators for his tireless role in achieving a change of guard in CAF, said he was happy that he realized his dream of ensuring stability at home and gain global recognition. \n“I’m not going to be a peripheral member in CAF but an integral member who will work for Nigerian football and ensure that African football competes favourably with the rest of world powers in the game”.
