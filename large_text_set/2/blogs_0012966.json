The full-bodied, no –damn giving actress refuses to succumb to the pressures of adhering to the standard Bollywood measurements. And, her recent outfit choices are proof. By flaunting her body (that most actresses would put under a strict regimen) in socially-unforgiving silhouettes (that most ladies would steer clear of), Huma’s tolerance for the “dress for your body” diktat is pleasantly low. While the actress may have graced multiple magazine covers with her voluptuous frame as the flag bearer of body positivity, it’s her unabashed dressing that is straight-up inspiring. What better way to preach than to wear your ideology like a seasoned rebel? Here’s looking at how the actress is helping us pull up our droopy self-esteems – 1. Huma takes on both, plunging neckline and a thigh-high slit, and finishes this stunner of a combination with a military-inspired blazer on top. Hereby, thigh-high slits are as much for thick thighs as they are for the ones they are deemed ideal for. sanjanabatra/via Instagrarm Get this Lulu & Sky dress here .Get this Madison on Peddar coat here . 2. Don’t hide under that expensive trench dress that you saved up to snatch at a discount. Instead, cinch it with a contrasting belt on top like Huma, and let your curves have a solo moment. sanjanabatra/via Instagram Get This Madison on Peddar coat here . 3. If you do pick a floor-sweeping maxi, don’t fall prey to the regular dress-up routine. Throw over a biker jacket and indulge in a little textural play. Huma does the same by mixing her brand of feminine vibe with some harmless grunge. sanjanabatra/via Instagram Get the Avaro Figlio maxi here .Get the Forever New leather jacket here . 4. Don’t be skepetical to cinch. Huma does the impossible by enlivening an already-peppy floral jumpsuit. All she does is that she puts a belt on it. Curves secured. Mission accomplished. sanjanabatra/via Instagram Get the label Ritu Kumar jumpsuit here .Get the Promod belt here . 5. Another day, another masterful cinch by Huma. This time, the actress introduces our faithful friend, layering, in the sartorial mix. She throws on a cute cape over her paparazzi-tackling dress and works the hell out of it. \nsanjanabatra/via Instagram Get the Kavita Bhartia dress here Get the Hemant & Nandita cape here 6. The all-inclusive cold-shoulder gets a definitive nod from Huma, who ticks all boxes of unconventional in a cheery yellow hue, an exaggerated shoulder and a calf-grazing length. sanjanabatra/via Instagarm Get the ASOS dress here. 7. Treat your curves in a well-fitted wrap-jumpsuit. In a single sartorial move, Huma disregards all rules that imply jumpsuits don’t belong on curvy women. Well, in 2017, it is an ancient theory. \nsanjanabatra/via Instagarm", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:57:12.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
