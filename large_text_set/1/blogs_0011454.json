Keep in mind, we've spent hours playing as these evil versions of Mario and Luigi as research, meaning the conclusions we come to here will be DEFINITIVE . Let’s explore, guys. This matter deserves our full attention. Are They Brothers? \n(source) \nThis might be controversial, but Wario and Waluigi are 100 percent not brothers. While Mario and Luigi are absolutely siblings, this doesn't mean that relationship translates to their doppelgangers. And since we've seen Baby Wario appear in the Yoshi’s Island series, we never see Baby Waluigi. Clearly this duo met later in life. Are They Lovers? \nI can’t state this any more clearly — it is incredibly likely that Wario and Waluigi are in a relationship. Here are two men with common interests and similar habits who hang around with each other all the time. But there is one scrap of evidence that refutes this idea — Waluigi is the main antagonist in Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix , and what was Wario? Simply a mini-boss at a carnival. I like to think that if Wario and Waluigi were in fact true lovers, their partnership would be that of equals, and Wario would make sure his boyfriend appeared in his games. As much as it breaks my heart, Wario and Waluigi are probably not lovers. Are They Cousins? \n(source) \nAccording to the Mario Wiki entry for Waluigi, the DS version of Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games suggests Wario and Waluigi are cousins. But hold on. Not only is there a huge citation needed tag on that entry, there is no way I'm trusting a Sonic game to give me definitive proof of the relationship between Waluigi and Wario. Sonic is the master of deceit for us Mario fans. Sorry Sonic, but no way! Did Wario Just Want A Partner Who Looked Like Him In Nintendo 64's Mario Tennis ? \n(source) \nThis is probably the relationship — Waluigi is part of Mario’s attempts to fit in with other Nintendo pairings like Peach and Daisy and Toad and Toadette. Wario must've paid a man to dress up as him to play tennis alongside him. Are They Just Two Weird Friends? \n(source) \nAccording to an interview with Waluigi and Wario voice actor Charles Martinet in 2008, Wario and Waluigi are in fact just acquaintances, and maybe friends. He said on Kombo , \"I don't actually know if they're brothers or not. I don't think so... I think they're just two nice, evil guys who found each other.\" Remember, this is coming from the man who voices them. Who feels them. Who is them. And this is most likely Wario and Waluigi's true relationship — just a couple of weird friends bein' weird together. \nYou can discuss this in the comments or find me on Twitter at @AlexFirer , but I hardly see the point because I am extremely right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T10:38:09.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
