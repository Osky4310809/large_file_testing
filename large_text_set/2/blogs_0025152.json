The poison was so fast-acting that Kim died soon after, on the way to the hospital.\nWhat is VX? VX has been described as the \" most potent of all nerve agents\" , and is so lethal its only known use is in chemical warfare.\nNerve agents are the most toxic and rapidly acting of all the known chemical warfare agents.\nVX has been banned under the UN Chemical Weapons Convention , which North Korea has not signed.\nThis odourless and tasteless liquid was first developed in the U.K. in the 1950s.\nIt has an oily texture and is amber in colour.\nHow does it work? Even a tiny drop of VX on the skin — unless washed off immediately, could prove lethal.\nImage: OJO Images/REX/Shutterstock\nNerve agents work by preventing the operation of an enzyme that acts as the body's \"off-switch\" for glands and muscles.\nWithout this \"off-switch\", the glands and muscles cannot turn off, causing uncontrollable muscle contractions which eventually stop the victim from breathing.\nOf all the known nerve agents, VX is the slowest to evaporate — making its effects able to last over a long period of time.\nUnder average weather conditions, it can last for days on objects.\nWhat happens to you if you're poisoned? According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention , exposure to a low or moderate dosage of VX might include symptoms such as chest tightness, confusion, nausea and blurred vision.\nExposure to a large dose of the agent may result in convulsions, loss of consciousness, paralysis and respiratory failure leading to death.\nThe movie \"The Rock\" centered around San Francisco being poisoned with VX gas\nImage: Cablogula/ youtube\nThose exposed to a low or moderate dosage usually recover, though severely exposed people are unlikely to survive.\nWe wonder how well protected the assassins were, given that they came so close in contact with VX, but there's a chance they weren't aware of how toxic it was.\nHopefully they were carry antidotes. You have to administer it almost immediately in case of contact, because the agent is so fast-acting.\nDo any countries have VX? North Korea is believed to possess between 2,500 and 5,000 tonnes of chemical warfare agents.\nVX is ten times more lethal than Sarin.\nVX and Sarin, another highly toxic nerve agent, is thought to be the focus of North Korean production.\nThe U.S. and Russia once had large stockpiles of VX.\nHowever, the U.S. has destroyed some 9 percent of its stockpile and Russia has promised to eliminate its supply.\nVX is ten times more lethal than Sarin, which prior to this attack, was the focus of widespread media coverage 1995, after an attack on a Japan subway by a doomsday cult.\nSyria is also believed to have had more than several tens of tonnes of VX.\nBONUS: North Korea celebrates nuclear test with coordinated dancing in the streets", "external_links": ["http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/20/asia/malaysia-investigaton-kim-jong-nam/", "http://www.cwc.gov/cwc_treaty_chemicals_schedule1.html", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TwZh666kMu2brY88Fgd0OqaJ234=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393996%2F32e24474-a0b6-45b1-a28a-68027ef6d94f.jpg", "https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/vx/basics/facts.asp", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iCQwajuByIzgbzxkDjJcZb5FGy8=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F394003%2Fdadc9725-5994-44f2-aa74-d87b6313c66f.png", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22307705", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/VzdbH0EH.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/VzdbH0EH.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QGWR0yl_MCf8i5atXET1qXacm9s=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393996%2F32e24474-a0b6-45b1-a28a-68027ef6d94f.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RHR28c8V917brT-P-HVlu8wrfZY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F394003%2Fdadc9725-5994-44f2-aa74-d87b6313c66f.png", "http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/north-korea/chemical/", "http://www.cfr.org/weapons-of-mass-destruction/vx/p9556"], "published": "2017-02-24T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:53:10.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
