ASUS CEO Jerry Shen revealed that the company would launch a Google Tango-powered smartphone at CES. Expected to be called the ASUS ZenFone AR, it would be the second smartphone to boast this functionality after the Lenovo PHAB2 Pro . \nBut just a day ahead of the official unveiling, Qualcomm accidently published a blog post dated January 4th, which inadvertently revealed the ZenFone AR. The post, which has since been taken down, says that the ASUS ZenFone AR will be the world’s first Tango-enabled smartphone to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 SoC. It will also be first to be both Tango-enabled and Daydream VR-ready. \nAlongside, a press render of the ASUS ZenFone AR has been posted by gadget tipster Evan Blass aka @ evleaks . The wallpaper in the render features the date January 4th and location as Las Vegas, which suggests that the device will be unveiled tomorrow at CES. The photo shows a beefy camera setup at the back, which will should feature special depth-sensing sensors to map its physical surroundings. \nsThere’s no word regarding the other specs of the phone at the moment. We will update you tomorrow when the brand unveils it at CES.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T09:03:26.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
