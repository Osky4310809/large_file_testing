The reason behind this wasn’t commented on, but The Korea Herald ‘s sources also indicate that Samsung’s own Exynos 8895 production is “falling behind market expectations.”\nIn January, we heard rumors that Samsung was “hoarding” Snapdragon 835 orders and that this had prevented other manufacturers from obtaining them. The LG G6 and HTC U Ultra were both subsequently released with a Snapdragon 821 processor. Meanwhile, Forbes also reported that the Snapdragon 835 wouldn’t be available “in large quantities until after the Galaxy S8 [launch].”\nSee also: When a small fire in Singapore is big news for Samsung 1 hour ago It has later been speculated that Samsung is predicting a greater number of pre-orders for the S8 and S8 Plus than it received for the Galaxy Note 7 , and greater initial sales than the S7 and S7 Edge achieved.\nConsidering all of this, it seems entirely plausible that there won’t be enough chipsets to meet the initial demand for the devices. It looks like Samsung has managed to guarantee its new flagships will be the first to sport the Snapdragon 835, but in doing so it might have cost itself access to significant quantities of them.\nWhile there is concern over Samsung’s own Exynos chips, it seems that the Snapdragon production may be the biggest problem. It may not result in a delay in the S8’s US debut (the Western Galaxy S8 models usually feature Qualcomm’s chipsets), though it could mean that they are in short supply at launch. Something to keep in mind if you’re considering pre-ordering the S8 or S8 Plus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T17:12:12.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
