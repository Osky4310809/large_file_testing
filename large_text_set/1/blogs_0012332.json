Bean trendy Commentary: The president-elect endorses the outdoor clothing company on Twitter, and the tweets immediately pour out --for and against. \nSomehow, I can't see Donald Trump wearing these. Photo by Press Herald via Getty Images \nThe worst presidential product endorsement I've ever seen involved President Barack Obama holding a selfie stick . \nI have no idea whether this affected sales of these frightful things or not. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump , however, usually restricts himself to recommending products that have the word \"Trump\" in their name. Until Wednesday, that is. \nIn his regular morning Twittering to the nation, Trump declared : \"Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean.\" \nI confess I'd never imagine Trump to be a duck-boot wearer, hiking his way through forests and glades. I couldn't find any golf shoes on the company's site either. \nSo why this product placement? As Trump intimated, Linda Bean, a company heiress and board member, is a proud Trump supporter. She's so much of a supporter that she's been accused by the Federal Election Commission of exceeding the contribution limits to Trump's political action committee, the Associated Press reported last week . \nThis led to her -- and L.L. Bean -- being targeted by an organization called Grab Your Wallet , which seeks to encourage boycotts of companies that do business, in one way or another, with Trump. \nFor its part, L.L. Bean took to Facebook on Sunday to say that Linda Bean is one of more than 50 directors of the company. It added: \"L.L.Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. Simply put, we stay out of politics.\" \nBut now Trump has brought the company into the sharpest political light. Which means, of course, that the company became a trending topic on Twitter . \n\"If you're salty about Donald Trump using his twitter account as an ad platform, let me remind you that LL Bean has an unlimited return poliy [sic],\" tweeted Pascalle Lepas .
