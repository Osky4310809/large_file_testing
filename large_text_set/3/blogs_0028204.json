US Magistrate Judge Andrew Austin confirmed that this is the case during an immigration hearing held on Monday, saying that a raid conducted in Austin, Texas was done in part to retaliate against Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernadez’s refusal to comply , saying that her department would only hold immigrants if the “individual was arrested for murder, sexual assault or human trafficking, or a warrant had been issued.”\nFrom CNN:\nAdvertisement \n\n“There’s been questions about whether Austin is being targeted. We had a briefing.... that we could expect a big operation, agents coming in from out of town. There was going to be a specific operation, and it was at least related to us in that meeting that it was a result of the sheriff’s new policy that this was going to happen,” Austin says in audio of the proceedings provided by the court.\nAccording to Austin, at a meeting in January, ICE officials told him and another judge that their increased enforcement operations were in “direct response” to Hernandez’s declaration of Travis County adopting “sanctuary policy.” Hernandez’s refusal to comply was in direct response to a bill passed by the Texas Senate that withholds state money from sanctuary cities. Governor Greg Abbot also cut $1.5 million in funding to Travis County. \nICE has denied that any increase in raids in Travis County were in retaliation to Hernandez’s decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T07:28:41.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
