The recent report is messier and shows that our decision not to confirm his nomination was right.” \nHe asked Nigerians to “continue to have full confidence and trust in the Senate as it discharges its responsibilities according to the letter and spirit of the Nigerian constitution.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T08:18:53.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
