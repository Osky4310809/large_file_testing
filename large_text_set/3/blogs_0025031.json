Arsenal power rankings: Who's in form and who must improve? Arsenal power rankings: Who's in form and who must improve? 1/10 Impressed: 1/5 \nAlexis Sanchez: Even with the controversy over contracts and his apparent 'laugh' during the defeat to Bayern, Sanchez has shown why he is Arsenal's best player. He came on to assist Welbeck after he was benched at Anfield and his goal against West Bromwich Albion was the result of a player producing as much as he can in a team that struggles to reach the same standards. Getty 2/10 Impressed: 2/5 \nTheo Walcott: Walcott is still to reach the heights of Sanchez but the goal against Bayern at least brought hope that he could end the season strongly. If only he could score similar goals on a regular basis. The inconsistent winger was also the one to break the deadlock against Lincoln, but offered little against an organised West Brom. Getty 3/10 Impressed: 3/5 \nAaron Ramsey: He missed the Liverpool game but with Ozil out the team Aaron Ramsey has had to handle the burden as the key passer for Arsenal, finding the space to move defence to attack, a solid performance and goal against Lincoln City showed promise. He had chances against West Brom he should have taken but overall the Welshman has been better than poor in March. Getty 4/10 Impressed: 4/5 \nHector Bellerin: A stand-out performance against Lincoln made the difference for Bellerin, who constantly pressed forward to open up a rigid defence. Rumours of Barcelona being interested in the right-back indicate what a key player he is for the north Londoners. Getty 5/10 Impressed: 5/5 \nDanny Welbeck: The former Manchester United striker is still on his way back from injury, but the early signs have been encouraging. Even though his return is in its ‘don’t strain yourself or you'll be injured again’ stage, the goal against Liverpool showed he can rise to the occasion. Getty 6/10 Must improve: 1/5 \nOlivier Giroud: When Sanchez was dropped at Anfield, Giroud had the opportunity to establish himself as Arsenal’s frontman, yet he struggled against an average Liverpool defence. He could not provide any inspiration in the defeat to Bayern Munich, either and scored only once in the month's four games, against non-league Lincoln. Getty 7/10 Must improve: 2/5 \nAlex Iwobi: Iwobi burst onto the scene last year, with impressive performances in the Champions League and domestically, but the last few months have been a learning curve. The Nigeria international is struggling to sparkle in the final third as defences become more aware of to what to expect. Getty 8/10 Must improve: 3/5 \nGranit Xhaka: Xhaka has managed to quell his temper over recent weeks, but he is still struggling with the Premier League's physciality. Meek displays against Liverpool and West Bromwich Albion proved that the Switzerland international has a long summer in the gym ahead of him if he is to add bulk to his bite. GettyGetty 9/10 Must improve: 4/5 \nShkodran Mustafi: The summer signing was injured in December and has struggled ever since the New Year. Laurent Koscielny arguably has not helped his partner's cause, getting himself sent off in the defeat to Bayern, but whether facing the skill of Arjen Robben or the physical prowess of Salomon Rondon, Mustafi has been left wanting. Getty 10/10 Must improve: 5/5 \nFrancis Coquelin: The Frenchman was supposed to become the lynchpin of Arsenal’s midfield, but his breakthrough seems a distant memory now. After playing only 45 minutes at Liverpool, he was benched for the visits of Bayern Munich and Lincoln City and didn’t even feature in the defeat to West Bromwich Albion. Coquelin has clearly fallen down the pecking order and will struggle to work his way back up it. Getty \nBut German Ozil insists he’s happy in north London and is remaining relaxed about his contract situation. \n\"I am contracted until 2018 and I feel very comfortable,\" he told German newspaper Die Welt . Wenger is more important to Arsenal than Sanchez or Özil, says Pires \n\"We'll talk soon and then make a decision.\" \nOzil’s comments will come as a welcome boost to the Gunners with their form deteriorating as they slip further out of the race for the top four. \nBut despite the recent downturn Ozil believes they can still end the season on a high. \n\"Of course, we have had a difficult time recently and we are not satisfied with sixth place,” he added. \n\"I am convinced, however, that we will catch up again soon. Let's see what the future holds.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T13:14:22.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
