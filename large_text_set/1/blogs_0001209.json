Today, in response to a Twitter user who called Scarborough a “disgrace,” Cuomo said that Scarborough was “not a journo” and that he worked on a “different standard.” MSNBC is a political talk show. He is a pol not a journo. He can be friends and support candidates. Different standard. https://t.co/pdSlFbPOCR \n— Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) January 2, 2017 \nCuomo’s jab comes after Scarborough threw shade at CNN earlier today. During an angry Twitter tangent against reporter Sopan Deb , the Morning Joe host told the former CBS journalist that he should write for CNN because “you’re very good at pushing fake news.” \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T04:27:49.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
