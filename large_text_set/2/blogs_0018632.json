SmackDown Live general manager Daniel Bryan announced Tuesday she had to surrender the title since her knee injury will prevent her from defending the belt during the mandated 30-day window, per WWE : WWE @WWE Bryan then pitted Alexa Bliss against Becky Lynch to determine a new champion, and Bliss prevailed. WWE Universe shared a look at the now two-time SmackDown women's champ: WWE Universe @WWEUniverse 2/22/2017, 1:32:25 AM The fact that Bryan was the person to break the news to Naomi was a cruel twist of irony, since he had to relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and Intercontinental Championship for health reasons. Tuesday's development seemingly confirms the injury she suffered during her victory over Bliss at Elimination Chamber is legitimate. WWE wouldn't take the title away—especially so soon after changed hands—unless it was sure she wasn't healthy enough to compete. Bliss revealed the injury during last week's SmackDown Live and demanded a rematch against Naomi for Tuesday night: Wrestling Inc's Marc Middleton wrote Monday that Naomi didn't wrestle during any live events over the weekend, but doubt over her status remained since she still held the women's championship. The timing of Naomi's injury couldn't be much worse. She was poised to be the champion going into WrestleMania 33. A native of Sanford, Florida, defending the women's title at the biggest show of the year—in nearby Orlando no less—would've been a special moment for her. Of course, WrestleMania isn't until April 2, leaving Naomi with over a month to recover. Her spot on the card may not be gone just yet.
