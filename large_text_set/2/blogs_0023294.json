Ana Consuelo “Jamby” Madrigal and Laguna Rep. Marlyn Alonte Naguiat of being behind the P100-million bribe allegedly dangled to drug convicts to retract their testimonies linking Sen. Leila de Lima to the drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP). Photo taken from www.facebook.com/Sen.Jamby.Madrigal \nMANILA, Philippines - Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II has accused former senator Ma. Ana Consuelo “Jamby” Madrigal and Laguna Rep. Marlyn Alonte Naguiat of being behind the P100-million bribe allegedly dangled to drug convicts to retract their testimonies linking Sen. Leila de Lima to the drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP). \nIn a radio interview yesterday morning, Aguirre claimed that Alonte and Madrigal were behind the P100-million offer, but the inmates rejected it. \nHe also claimed that the offer was made to drum up support for another people power that would have been timed with the celebration of the 31st anniversary of the 1986 EDSA people power revolt that toppled the Marcos dictatorial regime. \n“They should retract their statements on De Lima before Feb. 25, which is the anniversary of the People Power Revolution,” Aguirre said. \nIf people power succeeded, drug convicts would be set free, Aguirre claimed. \nAguirre said the source of his information was Lalaine Madrigal Martinez, wife of Noel Martinez, one of the drug convicts who testified against De Lima. He also claimed the informant is reportedly a relative of former senator Madrigal. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nAguirre said Madrigal asked Lalaine to help Alonte get in touch with the high-profile inmates. \nA source yesterday told The STAR that NBP inmates Herbert Colanggo, Engelberto Durano, Rodolfo Magleo, Edgar Cinco and Clarence Dongail were transferred to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) from the custodial center of the Armed Forces of the Philippines between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Thursday. \nThe source added the NBI invited them to give their statements, but refused to say what for. \nEarlier, Colanggo and Durano told a congressional inquiry that they allegedly gave millions to De Lima to fund her senatorial bid. Police: No shooting in Makati \nAguirre further claimed yesterday that Lalaine’s car was ambushed early yesterday morning at the old Sta. Ana racetrack in Makati City. The area is now a mall complex called Circuit Makati. \nBut Makati police chief Senior Supt. Dionisio Bartolome said no shooting took place at Circuit Makati based on their verification. \n“We have searched the area and the result has been negative,” Bartolome said in a text message, noting security is strict at the Circuit. \nThere has been no report of an injured person brought to any hospital in Makati and other areas, he added. \nSuperintendent Jenny Tecson, spokesperson for the Southern Police District, said no such incident happened. \nMadrigal is a member of the opposition Liberal Party. Naguiat, meanwhile, was elected representative of the lone congressional district of Biñan City in Laguna under the LP. She joined President Duterte’s PDP-Laban after the May 2016 elections. \nAguirre claimed that Naguiat is the “best friend” of television host Kris Aquino, sister of former president Benigno Aquino III. \nBut Naguiat said she does not even know any of the inmates whom Aguirre said she tried to bribe, and that she was willing to face Aguirre and his informant. \nShe also said she would talk to Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and other PDP-Laban leaders for “guidance or help.” \nShe said Aguirre’s accusation has put her and her district in a bad light and the justice secretary should have first verified his information. \nMajority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas, a party mate of Alonte in the administration, said Aguirre “should substantiate his allegations and file the necessary charges in order for Rep. Alonte to be afforded her right to due process.” ‘Aguirre’s claims are lies’ \nMadrigal also denied Aguirre’s accusation. In a statement issued from abroad, Madrigal branded as “baseless, malicious and outright lies” the claims of Aguirre. \nMadrigal also demanded an apology from Aguirre or she would undertake legal action to clear her family’s name. \nShe said Aguirre’s allegation is something she “not only know nothing (about), but have no reason to be interested in whatsoever.” \n“I have been living the life of a quiet citizen far removed from the political mudslinging Mr. Aguirre apparently enjoys,” she added. \nA staff of Madrigal told a radio interview that the former senator was abroad. \nShe also categorically denied ever having met Lalaine or that she was related to her. \n“I don’t know her and it isn’t true that I spoke or made any offer to her. The information being peddled by Aguirre is another bum steer,” Madrigal said. “I hope Secretary Aguirre isn’t losing his marbles.” – With Jess Diaz, Paolo Romero, Emmanuel Tupas, Ghio Ong", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:46:15.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
