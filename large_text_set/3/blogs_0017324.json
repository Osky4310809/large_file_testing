There are two options when you reach the end of your career: one is to retire at Barca, and the other is to try something new, like Xavi. But only Iniesta can decide that.\" — Andrés Iniesta (@andresiniesta8) March 9, 2017 \nBarca travel to Mestalla to face Valencia on Sunday knowing they will be five points adrift of leaders Real Madrid by the time they kick off if Zinedine Zidane's side beat Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. \nLuis Enrique, however, expects the title race to continue until the closing stages of the season. \n\"We're still involved in deciding this LaLiga and, as in previous seasons, it'll be decided at the end,\" he said. \"I believe that it will finish in a very similar way to other seasons.\" \nBarca team news vs Valencia \nBarca loanee Munir El Haddadi has struggled for consistency at Valencia this term - although he did score in the 1-1 draw with Sporting Gijon last week - but Luis Enrique has faith he will develop into a top player. \n\"Munir needs to have minutes,\" he said. \"He is very young and has a lot of potential. I'm sure he will improve.\" \nBarca have been drawn against Juventus in the Champions League quarter-finals in a repeat of the 2015 decider, a game in which the Catalans triumphed 3-1 to secure a treble at the end of Luis Enrique's first season in charge. \nRakitic was wanted at Madrid \nThe 46-year-old believes Juve are a stronger team than they were two years ago and expects a stern challenge. \n\"In the quarter-finals, you can't expect not to meet a big side,\" he said. \"Everyone has the final in Berlin in mind, but [although] they have changed players, they are still a fearsome opponent. \n\"They have different options. In the last few games, they've played a 4-2-3-1, but ultimately it depends on the function of the players. I'm more worried about the collective than by individuals.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T10:46:52.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
