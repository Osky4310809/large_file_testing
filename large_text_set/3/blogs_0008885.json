At all. With the score in hand, Ryan's line that Trumpcare isn't about getting insurance coverage to people but about \"access\" to health care just looks pathetic in light of the CBO's numbers . 14 million lose insurance by 2018 21 million lose insurance by 2020 24 million lose insurance by 2026 52 million total uninsured by 2026 (there were 46 million uninsured before Obamacare became law) $880 billion cut from Medicaid by 2026 15 percent of Planned Parenthood patients would lose access to care 64-year-old making $26,500 would pay $14,600 for insurance in 2026 ($1,700 under Obamacare) \nBut for all that, it does reduce deficits by $336 billion. Here's how. x \nAHCA reduces deficits by $336 billion, despite huge regressive tax cuts, because it offers people $1.2 trillion less help affording care. — Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) March 13, 2017 \nFor any one Freedom Caucus type swayed by that deficit cut, there will be a half dozen moderates who find the rest of it unacceptable. Because no matter how much Paul Ryan spins it as good or the White House spins it as bad , the newspaper headlines back home are going to be brutal. \nThe House Trumpcare bill is not a serious healthcare plan, and falls short of Trump's claim that any replacement would \"get insurance for everybody.\" Call the Capitol Hill switchboard at (202) 224-3121, and demand they reject it. \nHere are some of the other highlights of the day. \nThe CBO scoring confirms the analysis that health insurance under Trumpcare could cost more for some older people than they actually earn in a year's time. Trump repeated his conspiracy theory that President Obama set Obamacare up to implode in 2017. So Republicans have to come to the rescue. And the only way to do that is to take insurance away from 14 million people in the next year, apparently. Our president is not a stable person, and he's being enabled by people who clearly don't care about this country. He's not won over the Freedom Caucus maniacs yet, though, even with all the pizza and bowling invitations. Republican divisions, in fact, persist and will be harder to overcome now that the CBO score is out there. Ohio's delegation might not even need the CBO score to jump ship, since we know that 1 in 4 Ohioans could lose coverage under Trumpcare. Sen. Rob Portman's opposition to the Medicaid proposals in the bill could end up in firm opposition to the whole thing now that we've got a more complete picture. That could lead to more defections like the one we're already seeing from Nevada's Dean Heller , probably the most vulnerable Republican on the ballot in 2018. As goes Heller, so goes every Republican incumbent in any state or district that's even tinged purple. \nAnd for posterity’s sake, here’s candidate Donald Trump. x \nI was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid.
