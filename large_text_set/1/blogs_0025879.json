It also bars for around three months anyone from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan. IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's immigration orders triggered airline turbulence. Here's why Trump's moves may derail the stock market rally , and his tax and infrastructure plans. \nThe move also, Syth noted, suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows some travelers from outside the U.S. to renew a visa without holding an in-person interview with a U.S. Consular officer. \n\"Not only does this make it more cumbersome to obtain a U.S. visa, it sets up the possibility of retaliatory actions on U.S. travelers from these countries,\" Syth said. \"However, it is unclear how many current applicants are able to take advantage of the interview waiver and how many may be discouraged from traveling to the U.S. as a result.\" \nDelta shares fell 4.1% in the stock market today , while American lost 4.4% and United 3.6%. All three global carriers tumbled below their 50-day moving averages. \nSouthwest ( LUV ) and JetBlue ( JBLU ), which have fewer international flights, fell 0.7% and 1.5%, respectively. \nTrump on Saturday defended the executive order, saying it was \"not a Muslim ban\" and was \"working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\" \nBut protests, and confusion over the order itself, escalated through Sunday. Trump defended the order again on Monday over Twitter, saying over two tweets: Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage, \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 \nDelta was not immediately available for comment. \nThe carrier said flights were canceled after its \"essential IT systems\" went down at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday. Those systems were \"restored a few hours later\" and all systems resumed normal operations shortly after midnight on Monday, Delta said. \nLater Monday morning, the carrier said the outage caused takeoff delays and about 170 flight cancellations on Sunday and roughly 110 on Monday, with more possible. \nSyth said Delta was the least exposed to any fallout from the interview waiver program's suspension. American was the most exposed, she said, followed by United. \nThe stock slide comes after airline shares fell Friday as American Air hinted that it could start expanding capacity again after appearing show to more restraint in recent months. \nInvestors spent much of 2015 and last year hoping airlines would try to align their overall carrying capacity with passenger demand. Delta, American and United also face more competition from low-cost, long-haul carriers flying over the Atlantic. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T03:25:15.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
