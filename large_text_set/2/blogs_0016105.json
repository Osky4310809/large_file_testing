However, Cyrus Jones , a cornerback and punt returner for the New England Patriots doesn’t believe he deserves any credit for his team’s Super Bowl win over the Atlanta Falcons .\nJones said this to The Baltimore Sun: \"I'll never take credit for something I don't feel I contributed to. I was part of the team, but I didn't feel a part of it.\" \nEven though Jones’ rookie campaign ended with the team hoisting the Lombardi Trophy, he said his first season in the NFL “was hell for me.” That was the only way he could describe it. \n“I didn't feel I deserved to be part of anything that was happening with the team. I felt embarrassed that these people probably thought they wasted a pick on me,” Jones said. \nNew England drafted the 23-year-old in the second round in last year’s draft. The former Alabama cornerback got off to a rough start. He returned 11 punts, averaged 4.2 yards per attempt, and fumbled five times. His underwhelming performance weighed on him. \nWhen asked if he still has confidence Jones after fumbling many times, head coach Bill Belichick said, “ We have confidence in all of our players.” \n“We’ve seen (Matthew) Slater fumble before. We’ve seen (Tom) Brady throw an interception before, too. We’ll always do what we feel is best for the football team based on the situation, the particular game and what we’re dealing with.”\nThe 23-year-old is looking ahead to his sophomore season. Jones canceled a planned vacation and will spend the offseason in the gym. Will the fumbling problems fade away in 2017? Only Jones can answer that. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:18:51.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
