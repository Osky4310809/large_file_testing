Eldin Jakupovic - Hull Jakupovic earned his side a point (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nA huge performance between the sticks at Old Trafford, with his saves from Ibrahimovic, Pogba and Mata securing a hard-earned point for Marco Silva's men. And don't let Jose's customary post-match distraction techniques make you forget how good Hull were at the back. Read More Michael Keane - Burnley Keane's fine season continues (Photo: Alex Livesey) \nBurnley had a good day on Tuesday. A couple of shrewd deadline day signings in Ashley Westwood and Robbie Brady and another Premier League win to take them into the top half of the table. Solid at the back and a nuisance in the Leicester penalty area, Keane was key for Sean Dyche's men. David Luiz - Chelsea Luiz's quick thinking paid off (Photo: REUTERS) \nIt's not the first time that he's tried that free-kick routine this season, but the Brazilian proved that practice makes perfect as he made Simon Mignolet look more than a tad silly. While his brilliant goal would almost be enough to win him a place in our XI, he also put in an excellent shift at the back.

The defender made an early block to prevent Son Heung-min from getting on the end of a Harry Kane cross. The Ivorian will now be even more crucial for the Black Cats in their fight against relegation, with David Moyes moving to a three-man defence in lieu of any recognised left-backs following Patrick van Aanholt's departure. Etienne Capoue - Watford Capoue was a menace against the Gunners (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nThe former Spurs man played a key part in the 2-1 win over Arsenal which has quite likely put the kibosh on the Gunners' title hopes for yet another season. His run into the heart of the home side's defence set up the winner and Wenger's men couldn't cope with his drive.
