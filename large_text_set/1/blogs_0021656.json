Magu \nHe also commended the Chairperson of Iyaniwura Group, Mrs. Taiwo Osopitan, for heeding its advice against mobilising its members to Abuja to demonstrate in favour of Magu’s confirmation. \nHis words: “The report of the security service should be put in its right place: in the dustbin of history. We admonish the Senate to be part of the positive part of history by confirming the appointment of Ibrahim Magu. \n“The quest of the league in supporting Magu has nothing to do with his person, but intended to strengthen EFCC by ensuring that its head, now or in the future, is not blackmailed, intimidated or derailed.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T08:10:03.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
