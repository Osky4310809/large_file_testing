The brewery announced on its website that there will be a farewell party on Saturday, April 29. \n\"This is not a decision we have been forced to make, nor is it one that we take lightly. It’s a choice that will allow us (Scott Palmieri and Scott Wood) to focus on our full-time jobs, streamline our daily obligations, and most importantly, refocus attention on our own families,\" a message on the brewery's site read. \nAs of April 30, the owners of Mason Jar Tavern in Holly Springs and Fuquay-Varinawill be taking over brewery and tap room operations. The newly launched Mason Jar Lager Company will be a 100 percent lager brewery, a new direction compared to most of the area craft brewers. \nThe new place is expected to open in late spring/early summer. Mason Jar has also announced the launch of Mason Jar Mobile, a food truck that serves up beer-inspired snacks like chili spiced boiled peanuts at the brewery. \nAdam Eshbaugh of Mason Jar Tavern and 919 Beer will run the new brewery. \n[Read more craft beer news from Out & About.] Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:31:35.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
