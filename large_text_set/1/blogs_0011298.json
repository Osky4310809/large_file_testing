Her phone has been switched off since. \nThe teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, was then spotted on CCTV outside the Birthdays bar in Dalston at about 1.45pm on Wednesday. CCTV: Morgan was spotted outside a bar in Dalston on Wednesday at about 1.45pm \nMs Findlay, a project manager in market research, told the Standard she was at her “wits’ end” as she made an emotional plea for her daughter to return home. \nShe said: “I am absolutely going out of my mind with worry. We have had no contact with her for almost a week now. \n“We don’t know what she is doing or who she is with. She has only just turned 16. \n“We haven’t had any arguments at all and she wasn’t in any trouble. We think she might be worried to come home. We just need to find her. \n“We want her to contact us so we know that she is safe. Morgan Williams (left) with her mother Tania Findlay (Handout) \n“It’s freezing outside. She must be starving. She can’t have any money left now after being gone for more than a week.” \nMorgan had first travelled to London last Monday at about 11.40am to spend the day with some friends in Elephant and Castle. \nShe had called her mum to ask for a lift home from High Wycombe station as she travelled on the 453 bus from Camberwell towards Marylebone station at about 6pm. \nHer mum added: “We are not sure what happened or why she went. She said she would let me know when she got back to High Wycombe station so I could give her a lift. \n“She had kept completely up to date with her movements until then. \n“We then didn’t hear from her again until the next day when she messaged me to say she had been robbed. \n“All I can think is that she must have got distracted on the way home and it’s just spiralled out of control.” Appeal: Morgan's family are desperate for her to return home (Handout) \nThames Valley Police has issued an appeal to help trace the teenager. \nMorgan is described as black, 5ft 2ins tall, and of slim build with dark brown, long curly hair with freckles on her cheeks. \nWhen she was last seen by her family, she wore a black tracksuit, a Nike jumper and black trainers. She carried a cream-coloured holdall. \nInvestigating officer Sgt Hayley McEvoy, leading the search, said: “I would like to hear from anyone who has any information about Morgan’s whereabouts as we are understandably concerned for her due to her age and the length of time she has been missing. \n“If anyone recognises someone fitting Morgan’s description, please come forward and speak to officers. \n“Morgan, if you see this appeal, you are not in any trouble however please call the police so we can check you are ok.” \nAnyone with any information about Morgan’s whereabouts should contact the 24-hour Thames Valley Police enquiry centre on 101.
