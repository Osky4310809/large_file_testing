I have just got a call from my distributor Satish Anand that the breakthrough has been done by Kaabil.

He confirms the same saying, “Yes it’s the first film to release. Only Kaabil.” \nIt definitely is a big deal for the Hrithik film. Pakistan Government had lifted the ban and there were reports that Kaabil, Raees and Dangal will release after they are certified by the Censor board. Guess Kaabil managed to get their first.
