BARCELONA INJURIES \nAleix Vidal is sidelined for the remainder of the season after suffering a horrific ankle injury in last weekend's win away to Eibar. The former Sevilla right-back is likely to be out for five months and Barca are allowed to sign a replacement if they so decide. \nJavier Mascherano is also set to be out, while Arda Turan is doubtful after missing the trip to Paris. However, Neymar is fit again following a knock on Tuesday and the Brazilian trained normally in Friday's session to give Luis Enrique a boost ahead of the game on Sunday. BARCELONA SUSPENSIONS \nLuis Suarez will miss the Copa del Rey final against Alaves after picking up a two-match ban for the red card he was shown in the 1-1 draw with Atletico on February 1. \nBarca are set to appeal again in the hope that the Uruguayan will be available for the cup showpiece on May 27 at the Vicente Calderon, but the decision is likely to stand. \nSergio Busquets is banned for the game against Leganes on Sunday after picking up a fifth yellow card of the Liga season last weekend. BARCELONA POTENTIAL STARTING LINE-UP \nLuis Enrique is set to name a strong side for the visit of Leganes as the Catalans look to bounce back from the humbling defeat at the hands of PSG on Tuesday. \nThe defence is likely to remain unchanged, but with Busquets banned and Mascherano injured, Ivan Rakitic should start in the role of defensive midfielder alongside Andre Gomes and Andres Iniesta. \nLionel Messi, Suarez and Neymar, meanwhile, will be together for the 100th time in a Barca game. LEGANES TEAM NEWS \nLeganes sit just two points above the relegation zone after last weekend's disappointing defeat at home to Sporting Gijon. \nThe promoted side lost that one 2-0 and are without a win since November, having claimed victory in just four of their last 22 Primera Division fixtures. \nThe Madrid-based club will be without Robert Ibanez, Mamadou Kone, Jon Ander Serantes, David Timor and Ruben Perez on Sunday. BEST OPTA MATCH FACTS \nBarcelona won 5-1 in the very first meeting between the two sides in La Liga, the first game of this season in which the three MSN members scored. \nLeganes will play at Camp Nou for the first time. Only two sides have won their very first La Liga game there: Malaga in 1999 (2-1) and Villarreal in 1998 (3-1). \nLionel Messi has scored against 33 out of the 35 sides he has faced in La Liga at Camp Nou. Only Xerez and Hercules managed to shut the Argentine out. \nNeymar is the player with the highest average of chances created per game (3.06 per game), most dribbles completed (five per game) and most touches in the opposition box (8.33 per game) in La Liga this season. TV COVERAGE & KICK-OFF TIME \nBarcelona versus Leganes kicks off at 20:45 CET at Camp Nou on Sunday evening and will be shown live in the UK from 19:30 GMT on Sky Sports 3.
