To her credit, Lahren seems to be taking the suspension well. So I've got some \"me\" time tonight. Anything good on TV? 😂 #TeamTomi \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 20, 2017 \nLahren’s suspension — for something she said on a different television show, no less — has raised three important points about conservatives and conservative media. \n1. The abortion debate is the third rail of conservative punditry \nWhile Lahren has said quite a few things that have upset people outside of her core audience, the conservative darling may have broken the unwritten rules of contemporary right-wing politics. \nAs the Daily Caller noted , Lahren’s comments sparked rebukes from her colleagues. In an ordinary world, disagreements over beliefs would be left alone, but this is abortion we’re talking about — an opinion on abortion that diverges from conservative orthodoxy, to be specific. \nSoon after Lahren’s tweet, a reporter at The Blaze, Kate Scanlon, tweeted , “There is no ‘my truth.’ There is only the truth.” \nAnother reporter at The Blaze, Kaitlyn Schallhorn, tweeted soon after: “Even Hillary Clinton didn’t call pro-life conservatives hypocrites.” \nSo you can say pretty much anything, except pro-choice statements. \n2. Glenn Beck now believes there are consequences for speech \nBeck made a name for himself as leader of a movement that was convinced — absolutely convinced — that President Barack Obama was going to lead the United States into some sort of fascist-communist dystopia . But even he has standards. \nFrom the Daily Caller, which listened to Beck’s radio program Monday: \n“I would disagree that you’re a hypocrite if you want limited government and yet you want the government to protect life of the unborn. It’s very, very clear. But it takes intellectual honesty, and it takes a willingness to actually think these things through and to do more than just read Twitter or Facebook to get your news and your political opinions. You actually have to study things — these things out in your mind. Especially at a time period like today,” Beck said. \n“Bomb throwing is — bomb throwing in today’s world is dangerous. Freedom of speech, it’s not free. Speech isn’t free. It comes with a very high price tag. First, being intellectually honest and intellectually curious. Speech is not free. It comes with another cost and usually to the other people at the other end of your argument. The pen is mightier than the sword, and it can destroy people if your aim is clicks, views, and ratings,” he continued. In 2009, Beck said that Obama was instituting a “national civilian security force.” He has a penchant for comparing people to Adolf Hitler . But Glenn Beck is right about saying that speech “comes with a very high price tag”: In 2014, he settled a lawsuit brought by a 20-year-old Saudi exchange student whom Beck said was somehow responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing. \n3. Tomi Lahren learns that conservatism isn’t as tolerant of “diversity of thought” as she says \nIt’s ironic, though, that Lahren told Bill O’Reilly in December that she knew she was “going to be walking into a crowd of people that was going to boo me and jeer me” when she went on “The Daily Show” earlier last year, saying that she didn’t expect “anything from the mainstream media to be fair.” \nLater in the month, Lahren went back to Fox News, where she railed against the “unloving, intolerant left.” \n“The tolerance is really one-sided,” Lahren added, “because they seem to be pretty accepting when their narrative is pushed, but as soon as Kanye West ventures over to the other side, that’s somehow unacceptable.” \nBut even though she was more than willing to call out liberals directly while on a conservative-friendly Fox News show, she tweeted only in innuendo. I have my beliefs and you have yours. Doesn't make you right. Never said y'all have to agree with me.
