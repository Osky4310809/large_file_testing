Sutton United v Arsenal… UNDERWAY COME ON YOU GUNNERS! 🔴 — Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) February 20, 2017 \nConsidering all that, the actual match went well for Walcott. \nAfter missing out on the chance to score his 100th Arsenal goal when he failed to connect with Lucas Perez’s shot (that ended up in Sutton’s goal), he made amends by doubling the lead in the 55th minute. 👏👏👏 Massive congratulations to @theowalcott - the 18th player in our history to reach 💯 Arsenal goals ⚽ #Theo100 pic.twitter.com/fTdwbSmHPP — Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) February 20, 2017 \nTHE REAL STAR OF SUTTON v ARSENAL \nSutton’s 46-year-old reserve goalkeeper didn’t get on the pitch against Arsenal, but that didn’t stop him stealing the show. \nWayne Shaw has become an internet sensation since his non-league side drew the Gunners in the FA Cup fifth round, and today he took it to another level. \nBefore the match he was pictured hoovering the dugout, at half-time he was in the bar, and in the 83rd minute he was captured on camera eating a pie. \nBefore the match, former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer recalled a time when they were young teammates at Southampton. \n“He did (play in the same team as me), absolutely. When we were 14 or 15,” said Shearer \n“I actually followed my dreams to the Premier League, and he followed his to the burger van, I think.” Hoovers dugout before the game, in the bar at halftime, pie in the last 10 minutes.

We have to give them credit because every error we made they took advantage of on this pitch. They played very well.” Arsenal's French manager Arsene Wenger, second left, sits with his substitutes.

Within minutes there were audible chants from Arsenal fans saying: “Give it to Sanchez”. \nHowever, the Sutton fans chanted: “Who are ya?”. Though they obviously knew who he was because after the match Sanchez was mobbed by excited fans on the pitch. Spectators embrace Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez.
