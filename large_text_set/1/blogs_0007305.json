Add to this a change in user expectation and you have a recipe for disaster: where once it was perfectly acceptable to post a reply on a forum and wait for an administrator to approve it, this would be utterly unthinkable to most people in 2017. The impact on Facebook's share price, not to mention the free and open debate the site enshrines, of pre-moderation -- \"hold on, we're just checking the photo you've tried to post is OK\" -- would be absolutely catastrophic. Facebook Live is the latest example of this drive toward breaking down the barriers and filters between you and an audience. Live video, streaming with a click, is beamed to an audience of millions without any hope of the content being checked before it hits the eyeballs responsible for Facebook's billions of pounds of revenue. The challenges of fighting against filters are well known. In the wake of the murder of a television anchor in America live on air , both Facebook and Twitter came under fire for automatically playing the video. The same was said after the recent murder of the Russian ambassador to Turkey , shot live on television; his last moments shared time and again by Twitter and Facebook users, as it is every time a video emerges of the barbaric crimes of ISIS. Anyone connected with someone sharing these videos could have been scrolling through their timelines or news feeds and suddenly been force-fed a snuff video -- hardly fulfilling these companies' promises of a family-friendly, mainstream and safe web experience. Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook It isn't just snuff or gore, either. Islamist extremists and the far right also operate on major social media platforms. As web users are increasingly concentrated on a small handful of sites, we click shoulder-to-shoulder with the kinds of people sharing the kinds of content we didn't expect nor want in our lives. There's a contradiction here. On the one hand, governments and commentators are calling for social media companies to take greater responsibility for the content on their sites. On the other, these companies are embracing technological change that makes publication quicker, audiences bigger and administration more difficult. If this pattern continues, we can expect further outrages along the lines of the Chicago video, and less patience from governments already keen to pass the buck on Internet governance. Major social media platforms have nothing to gain from hosting this content, of course, but the truth is they are building beasts that they cannot tame. It's clear that 2017 will be a busy year for their policy teams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T16:45:33.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
