What angered me was not my Facebook acquaintance’s opinion, but her choice of words where she had casually called the DU student “an imbecile”, and drawn attention to the inaccuracy of the events that led to her father’s death. The argument was whether Gurmeher can be rightfully hailed as a Kargil martyr’s daughter. I cursed myself for engaging in a conversation so utterly futile. Tell me, do you even have a narratable recollection of what happened? Is the violent dissection of a soldier’s martyrdom necessary? And, most importantly, is this the price Gurmeher has to pay for having a peaceful opinion? Following the conflict between Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (hereafter, ABVP), and the students of University of Delhi and JNU, DU student Gurmeher Kaur started a campaign against the RSS-funded student organisation. She changed her Facebook profile picture to one where she is holding a placard that says, \"I am a student of Delhi University. I am not afraid of ABVP. I am not alone. Every student of India is with me. #StudentsAgainstABVP.\" The Internet, in return, hit back at Gurmeher by digging out a three-year-old video where she had blamed “war” (the Kargil war, in this case) for her father’s death (and not Pakistan). Celebrities and cricketers lashed at her opinion, jumping onto the narrative without even the slightest of compassion. What’s worse was that the DU student received rape threats for her allegedly anti-national stance, as it so happens every time a woman decides to have so much as an opinion. Despite media and the likes taking vicious jibes at her, Gurmeher stood on her peaceful protest. She didn’t resort to online bullying, unlike many other self-righteous bullies who responded to her with the worst kind of criticism. Here’s the thing – Gurmeher’s dissent didn’t begin with accusations. She didn’t pick on the fascism of governments or the impulsiveness of political leaders (if there was any). Her grief didn’t take over her rational side. It’s funny that most people, who hit at her with the choicest of expletives, don’t have a real understanding of what sacrifice means. Yet Gurmeher’s incident was poorly used against her argument. She was declared insane, owing to her personal loss, and attention seeking, following her weak (read calm) rebuttals. If anything, the 20-year-old’s perspective of war, sacrifice, and loss should be regarded higher than any of ours, we who have sat from the sidewalks and commented like the eternal know-it-alls. What do we know about losing a kin member to war? Imagine having to wait months before you could see your loved one’s face? Think about the nights that you would have to spend, in uncertainty, with a prayer in your heart? And then one day, out of nowhere, you are informed that out of all the soldiers, your person didn’t make it back? Now tell us, who will you hold responsible for that one bullet that hit your family member? Perspective is a funny thing. We all think we have it, till something earth-shattering happens to us and we are compelled to think otherwise. All Gurmeher had was perspective, a heart of a martyr’s daughter, and a peaceful opinion to share. What she got, instead, were insinuations, questioning her loyalty to the country, and disillusionment. Virendra Sehwag even drew a regrettable parallel between his bat and Gurmeher’s dead father. We failed to respect opinions, while expressing ours. And while we did that, we broke the girl’s resolve and chased her away out of the city. Out of everything that emanated out of Gurmeher’s protest, her decision to exercise her right to opinion without violence is the most memorable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T10:44:59.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
