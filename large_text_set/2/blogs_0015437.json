That’s where it’s important to determine who will and who won’t cope.” Mitchell Johnson in action for Kings XI Punjab last year. Source: AFP \nAt Monday’s auction Woodhill will work closely alongside Bangalore head coach Daniel Vettori and the franchise’s key decision makers to secure the talent needed to bolster an already impressive roster. \nThere are 30 Australian players up for sale, including star fast bowlers Mitchell Johnson and Pat Cummins. \nBut just because their services are available, does not mean they are guaranteed IPL riches. \nLast year, Usman Khawaja, fresh off averaging 172.50 in the Big Bash League, went unsold at the auction – though he did eventually pick up a contract with the Rising Pune Supergiants, replacing the injured Hashim Amla. \nThat same year, unknown Indian spinner Murugan Ashwin, who had played two List A games in his career, landed a contract worth $890,000. \nThat’s the way things work in the IPL and there is some logic to the madness. Murugan Ashwin became a very wealthy man at last year’s IPL auction. Source: Twitter \nFirstly, every side must play at least seven Indian players each match, meaning high quality home-grown talent comes at a premium. \nAnd secondly, there is a belief that local talent is more likely to thrive in India than the big-name international. \n“It’s around recognising whether international players, who are doing well either internationally or domestically, have to ability to perform in the IPL... BBL form definitely doesn’t guarantee a high auction price or that you’ll be picked up at all. \n“The unknown Indian player is already comfortable in their surroundings. \n“They have been identified as players of talent through either local performances or state performances and it’s sometimes easier to help them settle into the IPL than it is for an overseas player. \n“T20 is a performance sport, whereas the Australian ODI team is increasingly picked on potential. T20 players are expected to perform and are paid to do so which brings a different kind of pressure as it’s tough to rebound from a poor season.” \nTHE AUSSIES ON THE BLOCK \nHere is a full list of all the Aussie hopefuls and their reserve price: \n$389,000 reserve", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:09:27.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
