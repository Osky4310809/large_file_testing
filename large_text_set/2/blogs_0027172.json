Carol Vorderman and Richard Whiteley \nThe show was presented by Richard Whiteley and former politician Woodrow Wyatt, also deceased. \nRicky, best known as Bobby Grant in Brookside and Jim Royle in The Royle Family, told The Chester Chronicle : “I’ve got documents at home, which are printed ‘confidential’, ‘strictly confidential’, ‘not to be seen’, but it involves the likes of Ted Heath, Woodrow Wyatt. \n\"And we’ve just discovered that they made a film which went out on television the night the jury were out considering the verdict called Red Under the Bed and it was so anti-trade union that two of the jury changed their mind and brought a majority verdict in of 10-2 guilty. Sue Johnston and Ricky Tomlinson in Brookside \n“We found out this week that the film was designed, written, made and paid for by the security services. \n\"Woodrow Wyatt was a member of the security services and unbelievably so was Richard Whiteley who hosted the show. \n\"Richard Whiteley from Countdown was a member of the intelligence services.” \nRicky insists he has the evidence but was not prepared to pass it to the Chester Chronicle. \nScouser Ricky, who was actually born in Blackpool after being evacuated during the war, recalled that weekly union meetings were held in The Bull & Stirrup where all the decisions were made.

We know of four sedatives that were used on him. We also have certain evidence about a doctor that followed him into jail giving him injections.“ Ricky Tomlinson pictured for BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? (Photo: Stephen Perry) \nRicky warned that new ‘anti-trade union laws’ were being brought in this week which he described as ‘ludicrous’. \n“Things are going backwards instead of progressing,” added Ricky, who is fully behind Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: “I love him. \n\"I think what he stands for is tremendous. He’s not asking for anything that isn’t reasonable. \n\"And what the Labour Party needs to do; the MPs need to get behind the man and give him all the help in the world. Don’t be sniping at him behind his back.” \nRicky remains a close friend of his TV wife Sue Johnston and sees Chester-based former Brookside stars Vince Earl (Ron Dixon) and Steven Pinder (Max Farnham) from ‘every now and again’.

I didn’t know she was that ill because she never mentioned it, ever, ever. \n\"It never stopped her working. It never stopped her writing, never stopped her having a laugh and all that time she must have been in tremendous pain. She had a Mensa IQ of 174.” \nHe said Ralf Little, who played his son Antony in The Royle Family, was particularly close to actress Liz Smith who passed away in December aged 95. \n“In the show I was always having a go at Antony but he loved Liz Smith. \n\"He used to go and visit her. He loved her.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T22:16:12.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
