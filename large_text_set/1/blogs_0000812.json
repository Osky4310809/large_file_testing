When they arrive, she was almost dead, severely emaciated and was covered in her own feces. They were not expecting the dog to make it. 2 \nAs detective Eva Wagner described, \n“We realized [the dog] was alive, but just barely, so we rushed her to the Austin Animal Center where vets began emergency treatment. Her temperature was too low to even register on a thermometer and she wasn’t moving at all. We didn’t think there was any way she would survive.” 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-12-31T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T01:25:41.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
