Mazzarri asks a lot of his players and doesn't allow them many rest days (Photo: Getty) \nThe Hornets are in the middle of an injury crisis on the back of a gruelling run of fixtures and training programme. \nItalian Mazzarri is known as a tough taskmaster and pushes his squad hard in training. \nThey have also been given few rest days and many players have been left feeling jaded — which is there for all to see in their recent match-day performances. \nWatford still look safe of immediate danger, but the players would prefer lighter sessions to try to keep them fresh for games. Watford conceded four goals at home to Tottenham on Sunday...
