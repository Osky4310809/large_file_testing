Someone who isn't aware of what's been going on.\" \nPortuguese Silva quit Olympiakos for personal reasons in the summer after guiding them to the Greek title, and also won promotion to the Portuguese top flight with Estoril before a brief spell at Sporting Lisbon. \n\"They need to get the new guy in sooner rather than later,\" said Ashbee \n\"He's got good stock from overseas, but has no experience of the Premier League. \n\"It's a difficult task even if he had the whole of pre-season to put his plans in place, but it would appear to be impossible now.\" \nIt has been a tumultuous season for Hull, who are up for sale. In July, Steve Bruce left as manager after his relationship with vice-chairman Ehab Allam broke down. \nPhelan was placed in temporary charge and, even though he had only 13 fit senior players at his disposal, his side marked their Premier League return with successive wins and he was named manager of the month for August. \nHowever, the Tigers are now three points from safety and without a league win since 6 November. \nCommenting on the situation, former Hull manager Phil Brown told BBC Radio 5 live: \"It's not just about relegation as far as Hull are concerned. The fans are worried about their club. \n\"The KC stadium was a fortress when I was there and the fans kept us in the league. Now it's known as the library. It's scandalous what's happened to the club. \n\"There has to be a joined-up thinking in wanting to take the club forward.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T16:39:36.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
