In just its third weekend in theaters, Get Out has made Peele the first black writer-director to earn $100 million with his debut movie, TheWrap reports . \nJordan Peele Explains Why Childish Gambino’s “Redbone” Was Perfect For Get Out \nGet Out blew past its anticipated $24 million opening weekend to achieve a $34 million showing, which set the stage for its current estimated $111 million in domestic ticket sales. He also set a new studio record for Blumhouse in the process. \nThe film has been praised for creatively taking the horror genre to new heights while also cleverly inserting a much-needed conversation about race throughout the United States. It stars Allison Williams, Lakeith Stanfield, Catherine Keener, Lil Rel Howery and Daniel Kaluuya, who recently responded to a bit of controversy caused by Samuel L. Jackson, regarding his Euro-black status in real life. \nNot appearing in the film was Peele, who explained his acting absence in an interview with HipHopDX during a screening hosted by Chance The Rapper. \n“As an audience member, I feel like [my inclusion] would have taken myself out of it … they would be like, ‘There go Peele from Key & Peele,’ you know?” he explained to HipHopDX Editor-In-Chief, Trent Clark. \n“Also, I don’t think I’m a good enough actor but truthfully, directing and writing it, there was no chill. I didn’t have a second. And when I’m acting, I have to get into the character. I need time. And this was like nonstop decision making, nonstop directing. So I didn’t want to fuck that up. Because I know if I fucked up directing and I put out anything out to challenge that … never again.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
