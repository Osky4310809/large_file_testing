Virtually all of them said spontaneously, it’s a very positive letter, the tone was good, and so on. \nI will post a full summary of his interviews soon. \nThen, later, he is publishing the white paper on the “great repeal bill”. I will be covering that in detail. \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n9.45am: Justine Greening, the education secretary, gives a speech to a social mobility conference. \n10.30am: Ken Livingstone faces a Labour misconduct panel over his comments about Hitler and Zionism. \n11am: Steve Rotheram, Labour’s candidate for Liverpool Metro mayor, publishes his manifesto. \nAround 11.30am: David Davis , the Brexit secretary, makes a statement to MPs about the “great repeal bill” white paper. \nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time.
