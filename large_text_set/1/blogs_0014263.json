A quick overview guide of the players in the ecosystem can be seen below and should be explored as part of any strategy: \nThe benefit of this whole-of-market approach was summed up brilliantly in an article for Marketing Week by Jonathan McCauley-Oliver, the online sales manager at National Rail Enquiries in the UK. \nThey use programmatic to ensure that ads against the millions of page impressions its website receives each month are served smoothly and to their target audiences. \nHe explained: “If I go to a marketer and say that I can deliver your message to the one person who is likely to buy your product, that is worth a lot. If I can do that in five seconds to 8 million users, they’ll bite my hand off. This one-to-one relationship is afforded by these advancements in technology.\" \nImagine this as a central tool in your content distribution arsenal… How could this work in the wild? \nWith a ‘full stack’ of Supply-Side options at your disposal, the world looks very, very exciting, especially when you start to think about how you can follow and interact with your audience, almost irrespective of where you are. \nThe process starts with an understanding of where your audience can be found elsewhere on the web. We can use a number of tools and platforms that you may already be well aware of as part of the wider audience understanding work you do across marketing to do this. Audience understanding \nBefore you start any campaign, you MUST have a clear idea of where your target consumers are. To do this, I follow a basic process: \n1 . At Zazzle we have access to a great tool called Global Web Index . It's something I've written and spoken about several times recently, as it's becoming a core cog in the overall strategic wheel. In this process we use it to tell us which channels our audience uses regularly, such as in the example below. \nHere we see three similar brands compared to the UK average (purple). It is clearly telling us that they use search and consumer review sites. This provides validation that our targeting will work. \n2 . Next, we want to get more granular. To do this, we start with Comscore and Hitwise , a leading supplier of audience insight data. From within it we can extract information on everything from which sites our audiences go to before and after ours, as well as a broader view of interests and visit behavior. You can see below an example of what an upstream report looks like for the BBC website in the UK: \nUsing these two tools, you can quickly build up an accurate picture of where your audience is hanging out, either by analyzing your own site or those of your competitors or industry leaders. \nFor those that can't stretch to such enterprise tools, Alexa and Similarweb can give you similar information, albeit from smaller data sets. \n3 . We can also layer over a multitude of other data here. These are usually segmented into the following pots: \nIn reality, you would rarely need to worry about individual data providers. However, many of the programmatic platforms aggregate this into their systems to give you a one-stop solution to target correctly (we talk about example platforms a little later). Creative \nIn creating this guide we are assuming that you already have the process of creating the right kind of content nailed. I've written previously about how to design content strategies and campaigns to maximize impact if there are any question marks over your approach, but the beauty of this delivery mechanism is that it's just as effective for articles and guides as it is for major campaigns. \nTo understand what I mean, let's look at a couple of theoretical examples and how that could play out: Example 1: Video review content for a person buying a sports car Imagine the scene: You’ve been thinking about buying a new car for several months and finally, after several attempts, you’ve got a weekend free to test out that car of your dreams.\nOn Saturday you test three rival brand options and go away more confused than ever, as the car you thought you wanted wasn’t the best to drive. \nThat night, as you ponder that decision, those brands want to be front-of-mind. The smartest of the three has deployed a programmatic ad content strategy. By collating geo-location data alongside information from its own test drive database and by looking at Google searches, YouTube viewership, etc, the brand can work out which cars are in the frame. \nThis presents a unique opportunity. \nRather than deliver a display banner, all the data within the setup could provide us the opportunity to deliver a richer content experience. If we know that a user lives in Brighton, currently drives a sports car that is 3 years old, and has been researching new cars, we could tailor his brand experience accordingly (e.g. content could provide local Brighton dealerships, knowing user already has sports car and lease could be expiring soon). \nOr, even smarter than that, it could serve up a YouTube-hosted video favorably comparing their car with that of the rivals. \nA call-to-action could then take that person to the brand site and onto a dynamically personalized page that presents the strongest argument for buying their car. \nI don’t know about you, but I would be pretty impressed by that experience. Example 2: A person buying a laptop \nIt’s a similar story for businesses in the retail sector. Let’s say you run an ecommerce business and want to help add value at the critical point of the purchase funnel: when a potential customer is making their final decision on which product to buy. \nThis could play out in any purchase process, but for the sake of this second example, let’s imagine it is for laptops. \nThe decision is down to the last two options (Macbook Air and the Surface Pro). We know this as search behavior has included reading reviews and looking at comparisons. \nImagine if we could place our own review slap-bang into the middle of that process, in real time. As they trawl the Internet for info, our in-depth comparison review follows them. The likelihood of interaction is huge and we can even include dynamic call-to-action creative within it, offering a personalized discount or incentive to ‘buy now’ and from our site. So how do I get involved? \nBy this point, you should be thinking about how you may go about adding to your 2017 strategy but wondering where on earth to start. \nThe choices, as explained earlier in the piece, are still relatively limited simply due to the relative immaturity of the market and tech. Things are changing fast, however. \nIf your budgets are larger, then chances are you're already using the approach as part of your paid media mix. In this situation, the challenge is to reimagine the strategy with greater emphasis on content as opposed to commercial ad messaging. Think of it as softening the message and attempting to add value more. Talk to your agency or team and challenge them to test it. \nI'll almost guarantee they're not thinking about the distribution method as a platform for anything other than advertising message, so make it your mission to push them and help them understand that it may be more powerful as a delivery mechanism for value-adding articles, videos, and interactive assets. \nThis switch in thinking represents a huge opportunity for those that are willing and able to try it first, and the good news is there are a number of easy-to-use tools out there allowing you to give it a go. Programmatic for smaller business \nIf, like the majority, you are in charge of smaller budgets and don’t have the ability to onboard a global network agency with in-house proprietary tech like Cadreon, don’t think you're out of luck. There is an ever-growing pack of platforms designed specifically for this market. \nA personal favorite is Admedo , an easy-to-use system for those with little or no programmatic experience. With its own DSP (Demand-Side Platform), you can customize to your heart's content. We have seen some brilliant results from it. \nOthers worth considering include: Zypmedia – Great for local advertising campaign work and for businesses where geo-location is critical. Pocketmath – Another great option for the small business owner wanting full control of targeting, creative, and delivery. Brandzooka – A good choice for those looking to focus campaigns on video creative. Next steps \nSo, fancy giving programmatic a go?
