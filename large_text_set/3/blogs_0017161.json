By Sreeju Sudhakaran | Published: March 19, 2017 4:46 pm Jolly LLB 3 announced: Akshay Kumar has a childlike reaction to it – read details \nAkshay Kumar has been asked to flag off the Fourth T1 Prima Truck Racing competition that is happening currently happening at Budh International Circuit in Greater Noida. Knowing his mean stunts in movies, we can’t think of a better person than Akshay Kumar to do the honours. Akshay Kumar has even posted a picture of his from the event, after flagging off the race and expressing his thrill about it. He captioned the pic with this message, “So thrilling to flag off the 4th #T1PrimaRacing at Buddh International Circuit. These Tata trucks can seriously move ;)” \nIf you are unaware of what T1 Prima Truck Racing is, it is just like Formula One racing but with trucks. Not just any trucks but some mean machines that are better off in racing tracks than on our roads. The event, which is hosted by Tata Motors and organised by Madras Motor Sports Club (MMSC), is touted to be India’s only truck racing champion. The current season started yesterday with the qualifying rounds, through which the final list of competitors that has 12 international and 20 Indian truck racers was chosen. The championship is divided into three levels, Pro Class, Super Class and Champion Class. \n— Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) March 19, 2017 \nAkshay Kumar already has a hit this year in the form of Jolly LLB 2, with four more releases to go.His next release will be Naam Shabana, the prequel to Baby, where he has an extended cameo. There is the satirical love story, Toilet – Ek Prem Katha, where he is paired with Bhumi Pednekar. Then comes, 2.0, which is said to be India’s costliest movie, where he plays the primary protagonist to Rajinikanth. Finally, there is his wife Twinkle Khanna’s first home production, Padman. All in all, a very interesting year for Akshay Kumar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T14:29:40.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
