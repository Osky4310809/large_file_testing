Have Leaked Own Tax Returns \nDavid Cay Johnston revealed the 2005 returns on the air Tim Molloy | March 14, 2017 @ 6:44 PM MSNBC \nThe reporter who released Donald Trump’s 2005 tax returns said on “The Rachel Maddow Show” Tuesday that they may have come from Trump himself. \n“I think I have to include that in the list of possibilities of where they came from,” said David Cay Johnston, the Pulitzer-winning tax reporter who, according to Maddow, received the documents in his mailbox. \nJohnston said Trump may have a history of leaking documents about himself — and may even have leaked “very sleazy girl-on-girl photos” of Melania Trump that the New York Post posted last summer. \nThe longform tax document Maddow and Johnston unveiled Tuesday showed Trump paid $38 million in taxes, received a writedown of $103 million, and earned more than $150 million in that year. \n“Mazel Tov,” Maddow said as she read the $150 million figure. \nThe White House confirmed that Trump had paid $38 million. \nOne big takeaway, according to Johnston: Trump managed to pay a relatively low tax rate. Also Read: Maddow's Trump Tax Returns Reveal Met With Parade of GIFs \nJohnston said Donald and Melania Trump paid the same tax rate as Johnston and his wife — who made about $400,000 a year. He said that the Trumps earned “$418,000 a day.” \nTrump’s tax returns have been a white whale for the American news media since the presidential campaign, when Trump first refused to release them — unlike past presidential candidates, who filed their taxes in the interest of transparency. Trump has far more business entanglements than any previous president. \nBefore releasing the return, Maddow spent 19 minutes explaining why it was important that the American people be able to see them. The long windup served the dual purpose of explaining the news value of the returns, and — potentially — laying the groundwork for a legal argument that releasing them was in the public’s interest. Even before Maddow released the information, the White House said in a statement that it was “totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.” \n\nMaddow said the release was covered by the First Amendment. \nMaddow stressed that U.S. citizens have a right to know if their president is receiving payments from interests in foreign countries — including Russian businesspeople. She said such payments could have national security implications — and that the American people have a right to know if Trump is “financially beholden to an individual, to an institution to a country.” \n\nShe said there were also “petty” reasons to see Trump’s returns — including to see whether he has been honest about his income, charitable donations, and whether he has been under IRS audit. Trump argued during the presidential campaign that he could not release his returns because he was being audited, though an audit would have no legal bearing on whether he decided to release the returns. \nMaddow also said the returns would help reveal whether Trump would be “self-dealing” in his tax policies, and would support tax changes that might benefit himself and his family. 37 Hollywood Stars for Donald Trump (Photos) \nHillary Clinton had far more celebrity supporters than Donald Trump, but his 37 celebrity fans turned out to be the ones who backed the winning candidate.
