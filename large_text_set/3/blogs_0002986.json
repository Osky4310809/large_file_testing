London Bridge entirely evacuated either side of our office. We’re told to move away from the windows.

The rail station is apparently open if you access via the escalator under the Shard. There are lots of police vehicles and at least two fire engines are onsite. \nA police spokesperson said: “ We were called to a security alert in London Bridge Street at 1.40pm. The bus station and part of the rail station has been evacuated as a precaution. \n“ The incident is ongoing. ” \nSome eyewitnesses report that police are investigating an abandoned car at the scene. \nPlatforms 10 to 15 at the station and tube services have not been affected, the Standard reports. \nDETAILS TO FOLLOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:57:14.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
