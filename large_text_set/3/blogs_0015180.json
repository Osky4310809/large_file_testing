He won’t answer questions about things on the public record because to answer the question might set the wrong precedent for his other answers, but it’s definitely significant when he “refuses to deny” AKA “refuses to answer at all” a question about a presidential briefing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:02:30.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
