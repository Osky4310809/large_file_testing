Laurent Koscielny says player must step up and help Arsene Wenger. \nHe said in a national team press conference on Thursday, when asked about Wenger: \"He's someone who's been very important in my career. \n\"It's him who gave me my chance at Arsenal, who fashioned me as a player and as a man. \n\"We're in a complicated situation but it's not only his responsibility. \n\"It's us, on the pitch, who have to do more.'' \nArsenal are next in action on April 2 when they face Manchester City in the Premier League. \nAsked about his Arsenal career, Koscielny added, according to lequipe.fr: \"I feel good, I know the club and the people who work there perfectly. \n\"I appreciate my life in London, and so do my family. At the moment, I've got no reason to want to leave. I've got a long contract, and I'm happy where I am.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:24:50.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
