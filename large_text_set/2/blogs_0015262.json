Bringing in a singer -- 10-time Grammy winner John Legend — instead of rapper or band was an interesting choice. But it worked in New Orleans.\nOf course, Legend played biggest hit ever “All of Me” and the excellent “Glory,” backed up by a cadre of gospel singers on the latter. That song hit No. 1 in 2013 and sold 8 million copies. He also played “Start a Fire,” “Tonight (Best You Ever Had),” “Love Me Now,” his first single “Used to Love You” and “Green Light.” \n(Ludacris did not show up for his guest verse in “Tonight,” by the way, nor did Andre 3000 turn up for “Green Light.” They did use five seconds of recorded Stacks for the latter, however.)\nLegend cut his chops writing songs, playing piano for established stars and singing hooks for Kanye West. He became a star in his own right in recent years thanks to “All of Me,” “Glory” and a supporting actor role in Oscar favorite La La Land .\nBefore the game, The Roots and a collection of celebrities did a short musical on the history of the NBA before introducing the 2017 All-Stars. It was awesome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:01:27.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
