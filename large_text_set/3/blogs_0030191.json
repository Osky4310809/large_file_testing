Over 70 million people suffer glaucoma worldwide with 10 million already blind. \nAssociate Professor of Ophthalmology and Head, Glaucoma Services and Acting Head of the Department of Ophthalmology, College of Medicine,/Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Dr. Adeola Onakoya, called on all Nigerians, especially those aged 30 and above to go for regular eye screening to detect and treat eye problems, particularly glaucoma, early. \n“We are walking for glaucoma essentially to sensitise people to the disease. Our T-shirts are adorned with the message ‘Get your eyes tested for glaucoma’, so that people would know that there is an eye disease called glaucoma. Studies show that only 5 per cent of Nigerians know about glaucoma and it is among those that are being treated for the disorder. \n“The message is that you should get your eyes tested so you do not go needlessly blind from glaucoma. It is asymptomatic and life-long. If untreated, the possibility of blindness is very high,” Onakoya cautioned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T11:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:19:58.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
