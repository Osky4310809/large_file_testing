Zawinski, a former computer programmer who came into a fortune in the tech world of the mid-90s, says he has sunk $5 million out of his own pocket into the business, and now, he's \" run out of money .\" \nPatreon differs from other crowdfunding sites in that it provides a platform to raise money every month from a patron on a recurring basis for an artist or arts-related business or cause. \nWhile many who use the site are individuals — including musicians, animators, and other artists —there are also other organizations that raise money through the site as well, such as film production groups, arts criticism websites, and as evidenced, creative spaces. In DNA Lounge's case, they're trying to raise $8,000 per month. \n\"In the last few years, the financial situation has gotten particularly dire, and we're trying very hard to figure out how to keep the lights on,\" the page reads . \"Your sponsorship helps ensure that we can continue bringing you the kind of awesome, eclectic and weird events that you've come to expect from us! Your sponsorship keeps us independent, and lets us continue to take chances on the kind of local live entertainment that makes San Francisco great.\" \nUnlike other crowdfunding efforts, however, DNA Lounge won't offer a physical product in exchange for donations. \n\"We want you to donate to this cause because you want DNA Lounge to continue to exist,\" the Patreon states. \"If we offered rewards like, 'if you donate X dollars, you get Y free tickets,' then what we're really doing is selling you a ticket bundle.\" \nThe club's managers are hoping that this strategy will be enough to keep DNA Lounge alive, as well as its affiliated businesses, all-ages club Codeword and restaurant DNA Pizza. They cite that the club does a great deal for the artistic community in San Francisco. \n\"DNA Lounge has always been a political project: an attempt to move the needle of culture in this city. To provide a forum for a wide variety of art that makes this city a better place,\" the author writes. \"DNA Lounge is putatively a business, but it is also activism.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T03:37:27.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
