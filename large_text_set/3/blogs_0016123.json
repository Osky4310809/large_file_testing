The vandalism often includes swastikas, Fox said, like in one incident in early-February when straphangers on the 1 train reportedly banded together to scrub off several of the symbols. \nSeven of the hate crimes involved racial or ethnically biased verbal harassment or physical fights, noted Fox, who didn't elaborate on the individual cases. \nHalf of the year's hate crimes took place Manhattan, eight happened in Brooklyn, one took place in The Bronx and two occurred in Queens, Fox added. \nHe encouraged straphangers to continue to document and report hate crimes in subways, saying that despite the increase, investigators believe the offenders weren't part of some organized group. \n\"These are individuals that are tormented at the moment, that feel the need to lash out like this,\" Fox said. \"This is not a group, there's no gang, this is not a movement.\" \nOverall subway crime was down slightly this year — with 390 as of the end of February, seven fewer than the same period last year. \nDespite the decline, there were slight increases in grand larceny and felony assaults, according to Fox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:29:42.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
