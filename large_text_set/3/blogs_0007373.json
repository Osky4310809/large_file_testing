The actor's team have also called the lawsuits \"preposterous and without merit.\" \n\"I believe that any kind of mistreatment of anyone for any reason is unacceptable and abhorrent, and everyone deserves to be treated with respect in the workplace and anywhere else,\" Casey shared with the Boston Globe days after winning his award. \"There's really nothing I can do about it. Other than live my life the way I know I live it and to speak to what my own values are and how I try to live by them all the time.\" \nUltimately, Brie's night at the 2017 Oscars was a still a special one as she witnessed Emma Stone take home Best Actress for her role in La La Land . It's an award Brie herself won just one year earlier after portraying a victim of sexual abuse in Room . \nBrie admitted that while inside the Dolby Theatre, she didn't give Emma any advice. Instead, she was there to cheer on the talented star. \n\"It's less about advice and more about being there for support and telling lots of jokes just to keep it light and put a lot of pressure on the situation,\" she shared with Christian Bale and Kelly Ripa on Thursday's Live With Kelly . \nAs for the night she accepted her very own award, Brie has very few recollections of it. Thank goodness for video and photos. \n\"I'm very grateful that there are photos and it was televised because I don't think, I have no memory of it,\" she explained.
