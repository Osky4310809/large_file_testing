How does it work, you ask? At the end of this story, submit your style- or fashion-related questions, and I’ll pick the top submission to solve next month. (And maybe even give you a shout-out!) \nAfter receiving several submissions regarding shoe trends, ways to style boots this spring, and more shoe-related questions, for this month's feature I decided to zoom in on a single topic and share the one ankle boot style to ditch. Shout out to everyone who sent in questions regarding ankle boots, this one's for you. \nScroll down for this month's answer, and be sure to leave your style question for me at the end. \nWhat's the one ankle boot style that's out this season? Melissa Kane \nThanks for your submission, Melissa! Ankle boots are without a doubt a wardrobe staple, and since styles change from season to season, I can understand the urge to want to \"ditch\" a dated style and swap in a pair that feels a bit fresher. If you're clearing out your ankle boot selection this season, I recommend donating any low, slouchy styles . We're seeing more and more designers opt for sleek silhouettes with a pointed-toe or interesting heel rather than loose, non-polished boots. Luckily you can score a pair at any price range, and to make it easy for you, I've shopped my top picks below. \nShop my favorite ankle boots below! 1 / 15", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:30:02.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
