But really, it’s part of my make-up. Better read a prepared speech, it’s all-courteous, the words there are very diplomatic and civil,” he added. \nDuterte went on to praise the ADB for helping developing countries like the Philippines reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. \nHe noted that the Manila-based lender has extended $267 billion in financial assistance since 1966.   \nOn Monday, retired policeman Arthur Lascañas claimed that he was ordered by Duterte to assassinate criminals and rivals when he was still mayor of Davao City. \nLascañas also claimed that he was a team leader of the Davao death squad, a vigilante group linked to Duterte. \nThe retired policeman denied the existence of the group last October but took back his statement supposedly because his conscience was bothering him. \nLascañas also claimed that Duterte was behind the bombing of the Camamara mosque and the killing of radio commentator Jun Pala. \nMalacañang has dismissed Lascañas’ statements as a “demolition job” and “vicious politics” orchestrated by sectors affected by Duterte’s reforms. \n“With the ADB’s help, I am confident that we will be able to lift more of our people from poverty, expand the economy by about 50 percent in real terms and make the Philippines hopefully, I pray, an upper middle class income economy in 2022,” he added. \nFormer presidents Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Fidel Ramos joined about 400 senior government officials, ambassadors and other guests at the event. \nDuterte said he particularly looks forward to the next round of release of the $4.22 billion in loans and $9.3 million in technical assistance from ADB in the next three years. “These will be of help in realizing important development initiatives,” he said. \nDuterte also gave assurance that the Philippine government would redouble its effort to foster economic growth and reduce poverty. \nHe added that the government is pushing for a simpler, fairer and more efficient tax collection and lower rates and a broader base. \n“We are also working on increasing infrastructure spending to 7.4 percent of the GDP by 2022,” Duterte said. \nThe government will also solicit the participation of private partners in certain aspects of infrastructure development initiatives, the President said. \n“Together with the local governments, we are also streamlining business registration and processes, providing support for targeted sectors and intensifying the war against illegal drugs, criminality and corruption,” he said. \n“I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that there will be no corruption in my term. You have my word,” Duterte said, eliticing applause from the audience. \n“The ADB has been helping developing member countries in their efforts to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. It has extended $267 billion in financial assistance since 1966,” he said. \nThe ADB played key roles in the areas of infrastructure, environment and education among others, he stressed. \n“Our country is truly fortunate that ADB has decided to establish its headquarters in Manila,” he said. \nDuterte noted that ADB’s being based in Manila allowed the country to easily secure much needed development assistance, vital employment and technical and information transfers through the years. \n“For its part, the Philippines has received more than $16 billion from ADB in the form of loans and grants. About a billion dollars more have also been released in the form of loans and investments to private Philippine companies,” the President said. \n“These have made the ADB one of the largest official development assistance partners of the Philippines. For all of these, you have the gratitude of the entire Filipino people,” he said. \n“May the ADB continue to be an important partner for development for the Philippines, the entire East Asia and the Pacific,” the President said.
