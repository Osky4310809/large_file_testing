I’m not sure physical was 100 per cent the right word, but it is not usual for us to lack it,” he said. \n“In my opinion making fouls is not physical - it doesn’t help usually. Being harder than allowed, it doesn’t make sense. I think we are usually clean - not ugly challenges - but physical. \n“It is not a general problem for us. I never force my players to make fouls - even in a challenge we want to keep the ball and not break a leg. Being physical means being ready to hurt yourself not the other player.” \nInconsistency is the problem Liverpool will take into the Arsenal showdown, that will tell us more about which of the two disappointing teams is likely to snatch a top four place this season. Klopp has called for consistency (Photo: John Powell) \nHe said: “We have had our worst moments in the season, meanwhile we have had this lack of consistency, we can not ignore it, that is what we have to do now, we can not compare with the start of the season. \n“We are now in the middle of the season, so it makes sense we try to deliver again on Saturday. We can not ignore our lack of consistency, but we can be 100 per cent optimistic again. \n“I can not say I will be in the same mood as the start of the season. The performance at Leicester was not good enough, that’s all. \n“We made the analysis already, I can not keep it in my backpack all week, it’s now Arsenal. The whole style of play is completely different.” The Red slumped to a 3-1 defeat at Leicester on Monday evening (Photo: Getty) \nNow Klopp demands his players improve and develop...or he brings in replacements who can reach the level he requires. \nHe insisted yesterday he has faith in his squad, but it is not unlimited. And he made clear that he does believe he must bring in new faces in the summer the only question is how many. And it could be seven. \n“In general I don’t doubt the players. I don’t doubt them as a group, but doubt doesn’t mean that we can not improve,” he added. \n“I said after the Leicester game, we all played for our future, for and with, that’s how it is - we get judged.
