But the other 31 teams aren’t as mentally challenged as Rick Spielman, the best thing to happen to the Bears, Lions and Packers in several years. bondlake says: Mar 28, 2017 5:52 PM \nI don’t know about now, but I always wished that Green Bay could have had him during his prime. No one could have stopped the Pack with him in the backfield. No one. redlikethepig says: Mar 28, 2017 5:52 PM \nCoach speak … what else is he going to say? madmike66 says: Mar 28, 2017 5:54 PM \n“The Giants could clearly use someone who is an every-down back”. Yeah, but Adrian Peterson is not an every down back. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
