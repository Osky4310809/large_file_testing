But putting that aside, Guerra seems to miss one major fact. Trump’s wall is not yet built. \n“You can climb it with great ease, one climbs in an instant,â Guerra said. âI climbed it in Tijuana, one of the highest parts. Even from a distance, this looks very complex, but there are young people that go up and down at all times.â Sencillo subir al #Muro pero son muchos los peligros para nuestra gente.
