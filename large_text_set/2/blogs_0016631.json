Many dissed the couple for naming their baby after Emperor Timur Lang , who was the man behind a brutal massacre that killed thousands of Indians in 1399 AD. When asked about this controversy surrounding his little one, the Nawab told Times of India : \nMy daughter told me, why don’t you say that you have not named him after Timur Lang, say that’s Timur and this is Taimur. \nHe also said: \nIncidentally, Timur Lang’s son was Shah Rukh, who is the guy who supposedly said we should actually plunder India. A lot of fighting was done by his sons, but nobody has a problem with the name Shah Rukh (laughs). \nKhan even revealed that he was contemplating on changing his son’s name: \nYou know, actually – I haven’t told anyone this – I thought for a second about changing his name. For a couple of weeks. And Kareena was a little against it and she said, ‘People respect you for your opinion and you can’t’… So I said, yeah, but it’s not about people. I don’t want him to get unpopular. And I still might, maybe when he’s one or two, I might change his name in a while, it’s still sinking in, what to do. Someone in my PR agreed with me, and we drafted a small letter. And when I read it, it was so pathetic, that I cancelled the idea. \nHe added: \nIf I feel that he’s going to get in trouble in school, I might change it still. It’s a bit late now though. Or not. I don’t know. You wouldn’t want him to be known as the boy who was originally called Taimur, would you? \nYou can read the entire interview here . 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:08:02.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
