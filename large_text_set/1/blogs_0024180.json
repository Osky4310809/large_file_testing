Obesity is fuelling rising cases of diabetes in the UK Credit: PA \nT he pancreas creates insulin, and type 2 diabetes is caused when the body does not use the hormone properly, creating insulin resistance. \nExperts said it was possible that the treatment for diabetes increases the risk of pancreatic cancer, or that the cancer caused the increased risk of diabetes. \nWhile diabetes is extremely common, with more than 3.5 million cases in the UK, pancreatic cancer remains relatively rare, with around 10,000 diagnoses annually. Doctors and their diabetic patients should be aware that the onset of diabetes or rapidly deteriorating diabetes could be the first sign of hidden pancreatic cancer Alice Koechlin, from the International Prevention Research Institute \nR esearchers said more needs to be done to develop earlier tests for pancreatic cancer so that those at extra risk - such as those newly diagnosed with diabetes - could undergo screening. \nAlice Koechlin, from the International Prevention Research Institute said: “Doctors and their diabetic patients should be aware that the onset of diabetes or rapidly deteriorating diabetes could be the first sign of hidden pancreatic cancer, and steps should be taken to investigate it.” \nShe said more work was needed to attempt to identify pancreatic cancer before symptoms were present. \n“There is currently no good, non-invasive method for detecting pancreatic cancer that is not yet showing any visible signs or symptoms. We hope that our results will encourage the search for blood markers indicating the presence of pancreatic cancer, which could guide decisions to perform a confirmation examination like endoscopy,\" she said. \nMaggie Blanks, chief executive of national charity Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund welcomed the findings. \nShe said: \"The association between pancreatic cancer and type 2 diabetes has been an area of interest to researchers for several years, so it’s great to see studies generating new and potentially very valuable information which could alert clinicians to the need for further investigation in certain patients.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T08:06:00.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
