Giangreco responded by saying Fox News should change its name to Nazi News. \nWe asked WLS for comment, but have not heard back. Giangrego is a legend in Chicago TV sports. He’s been sports director at ABC-owned WLS since 1994, after spending the previous 12 years at NBC-owned WMAQ. @bruce_arthur so obvious, so disturbing .America exposed as a country full of simpletons who allowed this cartoon lunatic to be \"elected\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:37:27.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
