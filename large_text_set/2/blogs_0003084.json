Yep. Definitely Sean Spicer. \nIf you missed it somehow, Melissa McCarthy did a damn hilarious impersonation on Saturday Night Live of White House Press Secretary, Dippin’ Dots™ nemesis , potentially unironic retweeter of Onion articles , and huffy gaslighter Sean Spicer. And Spicer is now definitely aware of Melissa McCarthy’s impersonation of him. Uh oh. Everybody try to look busy. Sean Spicer out here throwing podiums.\nSNL\n\nExtra ‘s AJ Calloway spoke to Spicer at the Super Bowl in Houston on Sunday, asking him — as any good journalist should — what he thought of McCarthy’s impression.\nExplaining that he’d first heard about the sketch while leaving church Sunday morning, Spicer said his texts had been blowing up so much he thought there must be a national emergency.\nSpicer told Extra exclusively he felt the impression was a little exaggerated. His advice was that McCarthy “needs to slow down on the gum chewing; way too many pieces in there.” Though he thought it was a really “funny” show, he felt that McCarthy “could dial back” a bit.\nOne universal rule about making jokes is that nobody will ever dial it back.\nEver the predictable Trump employee, Spicer was smart enough to reserve more ire for SNL’s treatment of Trump than of himself, echoing Trump’s own sentiments :\n“Alec [Baldwin] has gone from funny to mean, and that’s unfortunate. SNL used to be really funny. There’s a streak of meanness now that they’ve crossed over to mean.”\nLook out. Sean Spicer’s here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and just wait a minute because he’s not done swallowing all this gum yet.\nSNL\n(Via Extra TV and Pedestrian TV )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:34:57.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
