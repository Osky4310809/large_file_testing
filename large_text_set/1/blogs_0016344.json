(photo credit:REUTERS) \nMoving up one spot from last year, Israel has been named the 10th most innovative economy in the world, in the 2017 Bloomberg Innovation Index.The index, according to Bloomberg, ranks economies annually by analyzing seven contributing factors such as research and development spending and the concentration of public hi-tech companies in each country. Israel moved from 11th place to 10th this year, ousting France from its place in the top-10 strongest innovation economies. Israeli innovation in Africa to appear at UN exhibit South Korea topped the list for the second year in a row, followed by Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Singapore, Japan, Denmark, the United States and Israel. Israel achieved first place in the \"researcher concentration category,\" or the number of professionals – including postgraduate PhD students – engaged in R&D per million people in the country. The country was ranked second and trailed only South Korea in the \"R&D intensity\" category, or R&D expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Israel also did well in the \"hi-tech density\"– the number of domestically domiciled hi-tech public companies – placing third, just after the United States and France. In addition to these three categories, the total scores of the contenders were calculated based on four other factors as well, including \"manufacturing value-added,\" as a percentage of GDP and per capita. The index also looked at \"productivity\"– GDP and gross national income (GNI) per employed persons ages 15 and older – and \"tertiary efficiency\"– the total enrollment in tertiary education. Lastly, the index looked at \"patent activity,\" the number of resident patent filings per million population and filings per $100 billion GDP. While the ranking began with more than 200 economies, those that failed to report data for at least six of these seven categories were eliminated, reducing the list to 78 nations, according to the index. Bloomberg then published the overall and category scores for the top 50 countries. Relevant to your professional network?
