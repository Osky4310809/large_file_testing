They didn’t win the conference tournament, but Kansas still ruled the roost in the conference only losing twice in conference play.\nLast year, Kansas was also a No. 1 seed, and made it all the way to the Elite Eight before losing to eventual national champion Villanova. They’re led this season by Frank Mason III who leads the team in scoring with 20.8 points per game and 5.1 assists. \nThey’ll start their run to a potential Final Four against the winner of a play-in game between NC Central and UC Davis on Friday in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Should the Jayhawks win their first two games, they’ll play very close to home in the Sweet 16 with the Midwest regional site being in Kansas City. \nTournament darlings Michigan make it into the tournament as a No. 7 seed, and they’ll face 10-seeded Oklahoma State. Tricky matchups for other teams include No. 5 Iowa State and No. 12 Nevada as well as No. 8 Miami and No. 9 Michigan State. \nYou can see the full bracket here , and you can print one out here .
