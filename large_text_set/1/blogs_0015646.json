Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDimitri Payet’s desperation to rejoin Marseille has seen him already reject an approach from China over moving to the Far East in the current transfer window. \nPayet’s representatives were contacted by Hebei China Fortune, the club who count Ezequiel Lavezzi and Gervinho among their squad. \nThe CSL side indicated that they would pay whatever fee required by West Ham - now asking £30million for the want-away star - while paying Payet £500,000 per month after tax, reports France Football. \nHowever, Payet is only interested in returning to the Stade Velodrome and his agent dismissed the offer out of hand.
