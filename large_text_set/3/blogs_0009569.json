Members Sign In N.H. woman injects woman trying to give birth with drugs By Andy Rosen Globe Staff March 08, 2017 \nA New Hampshire woman allegedly used a dirty syringe to inject narcotics into another woman who had requested the drugs while attempting to give birth at a Concord, N.H., home, police said. \nFelicia Farruggia, 29, of Concord, and her 37-year-old associate Rhianna Frenette of Belmont, N.H. are facing reckless conduct charges in the September incident, which concluded with Farruggia giving birth to a baby boy on the way to an ambulance in the driveway, Concord police said. Advertisement \nThe women appeared in Concord District Court on Wednesday. Farruggia was ordered held on $15,000 cash bail, and Frenette was ordered held on $25,000. \nAccording to police, Farruggia was having medical issues while she was in labor at 4 Elmwood Ave. Sept. 15. Police said she refused to allow residents to call 911 for help until she had received the narcotics. Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Both she and the baby were hospitalized, and the child is now in state custody, police said. Advertisement \n“That’s probably the best place he could be,” Ford said in an interview. Farruggia has other children who were already in state custody when the incident happened, he said. \nFord described the case as an “appalling” example of the toll that drugs are taking on New Hampshire communities. \n“It just seems to be getting worse,” he said. “Every time you think it can’t, it does.” Andy Rosen can be reached at .
