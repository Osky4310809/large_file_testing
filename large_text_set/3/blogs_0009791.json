Meanwhile, Sam Mangubat went all the way Bruno Mars, as Noven Bellleza took on the entire repertoire of Air Supply. \nIn the end, it was Noven who emerged as the first champion of ABS-CBN’s singing competition that noontime show “It’s Showtime” revived last year. What did the judges and the viewers see in him for him to get an almost 100 percent perfect score? \nFrom afar, Noven, as Rico J. Puno said, looked like Ogie Alcasid as he stood like a superstar slaying Air Supply’s medley of songs, earning him a standing ovation from both the judges and the audience, which gave him a combined score of 99.96 percent, almost 50 percent more than the second placer, Sam Mangubat, who got 49.09 percent, while   \nWhen Noven saw how his contenders performed before him, he said, “Nangingilabot po ako pero ang sabi ko sa sarili ko, ‘Di bale, basta kakanta na lang ako!’” \n“Okay lang naman po sa’kin kahit sa’min sa top three ang manalo kasi lahat naman po kami deserving. Nagdasal naman ako na kahit anong ibigay mo sa’kin, tatanggapin ko, basta bigyan mo lang ako ng magandang performance,” enthused Noven, who will continue training to become a professional singer.   \nThough he shone on stage, up close, one can see the battle scars, the skin burnt and wrinkled by the sun, that he went through as a farmer who used to sing alone while plowing the fields of Negros Occidental. This story imprinted on his skin, very telling even without him opening his mouth, plus the talent that effortlessly comes out when he does open his lips, are his aces for winning the competition, said the head judge, Rey Valera. \nAccording to Valera, nothing can beat Noven’s inspiring story and the kind of experience he gave to the live audience in Resorts World Manila. \n“Kung anong nakita ninyo (audience) ‘yun din nakita namin (judges). Isa s’yang tao tulad natin,” Valera explained to Philstar.com why they chose Bellleza. \n“Noong itong tatlo (finalists) na, I have to admit, s’ya (Noven) ang pinakamataas sa’kin. Iba ‘yung impact n’ya. Kung nandito kayo sa Resorts World, makikita n’yo ‘yung impact n’ya sa tao. Hinding hindi mo matatawaran ‘yun” elucidated another judge and OPM icon, Ogie Alcasid. \n“Noven, salamat sa inspirasyon na ibinibigay mo sa amin. Napakaganda ng regalo sa’yo ng panginoon - ‘yang storya mo at ‘yang napakaganda mong boses. Hangad ko ang iyong patuloy na tagumpay at ang dasal ko ay mas marami ka pang ma-inspire na tao.” \nDuring the first round, Noven’s version of “May Bukas Pa,” made the original singer of the song, Rico J. Puno, exclaim, “Ikaw lang ang makakagawa n’yan! ‘Di ko kaya ‘yan!…Nakuha mo ako ng buong-buo!” \nSimilarly, another judge, Nyoy Volante, commented: “Your voice is very unique! Effortless kang magpasikat ng songs. You satisfy all criteria we’re looking for - style, vocal power, quality.“ \nIt was a major highlight of the show when the contest’s judges rendered their original songs together with the contest’s finalists from way back the ‘70s. Valera sang his own “Kailangan Mo Ako,” Alcasid did his hit, “Nandito Ako,” Jaya with “Dahil Tanging Ikaw,” and Yeng Constantino capped off with “Salamat.” \nNext year, when the show awards   its   Kids” talent search that starts this March 13, Noven will be joining the judges in the panel and in the medley. From singing under the heat of the sun, from now on, he will be singing under the glare of the spotlight.
