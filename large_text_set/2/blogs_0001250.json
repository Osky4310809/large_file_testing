(How?!) \nMonday night, LeBron James made public his own war - with Charles Barkley. The words were as blunt and direct as any we've ever seen directed toward Barkley, the Hall of Famer-turned-TNT analyst who always drops the hottest takes. \nHe then hopped on Twitter to make sure we understood . \nQuite simply, James - a huge Jay-Z fan - laid out his very own \"Takeover.\" And we can prove it. Just look at these parallels: \nLeBron: \"He's a hater. What makes what he says credible? Because he's on TV. I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that.\" Jay-Z: \"Hey, lil soldier, you ain't ready for war. R.O.C. too strong for y'all! It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test.\" \nYou've got to set the tone early. You're not having it. You're bigger than this. But you're going to go there because they made you. \nLeBron: \"I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.\" Jay-Z: \"I got the pictures. I seen ya. Then you dropped 'Shook Ones,' switched your demeanor. Well, we don't believe you, you need more people.\" \nBarkley telling LeBron to act like a leader? Charles is ignoring his entire past. But James isn't, just like Hov didn't with Prodigy. \nLeBron: \"All I've done for my entire career is represent the NBA the right way. Fourteen years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that.\" Jay-Z: \"You're not on my level, go get your brakes tweaked. I sold what your whole album sold in my first week. You guys don't want it with Hov.\" \nNever forget to explain how much better you are in a diss track. \nLeBron: \"Go watch the '93 Finals when John Paxson hit the shot. Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during one of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the Finals. But, oh, nobody were friends back then.\" Jay-Z: \"You said you've been in this 10. I've been in it five - smarten up, Nas. Four albums in 10 years? I could divide. That's one every - let's say, two. Two of them s- was due. One was 'nah,' the other was Illmatic. That's a one-hot-album-every-10-year average.\" \nSure, James was throwing Barkley's own actions back in his face with this quote. Mostly, though, he was reminding Charles of his only shot at a ring and how he blew it. Barkley's 1993 was Nas' 1994. He never made it back to the Finals - a place James has been to over and over again, seven times. \nLeBron: \"I know he wanted to retire a long time ago, but he can't. He's stuck up on that stage every week.\" Jay-Z: \"Went from Nasty Nas to Esco's trash. Had a spark when you started, but now you're just garbage. Fell from top 10 to not mentioned at all.\" \nPretty self-explanatory. Sometimes time writes its own endings for us. \nLeBron: \"I went to see Melo at the Garden two years ago when we were in New York. They played Portland. I went up to a suite at halftime, and Phil Jackson didn't say one word to me. … I'm here to win ballgames and take care of my teammates and take care of my, what's that word, oh, my 'posse.'\" Jay-Z: \"So stop with that childish shit, n-, I'm grown. Please leave it alone, don't throw rocks at the throne. … Go play somewhere, I'm busy.\" \nHad to include the shots at Phil Jackson, which essentially were: Why are you even talking to me? \nLeBron: \"And if this makes him want to talk to me, the schedule's out there. He knows every road arena I'll be in. Don't just come up to me at All-Star and shake my hand and smile.\" Jay-Z: \"It's only so long fake thugs can pretend.\" \nThe ultimatum. \nLeBron: \"I'm tired of biting my tongue. There's a new sheriff in town.\" Jay-Z: \"Gonna learn to respect the king. Don't be the next contestant on that Summer Jam screen.\" \nMake no bones about it. This was a threat. Skip Bayless and anyone else still trying to come at James better watch out. He'll undress you. \nThe best part of this parallel is what came next in the Jay-Z vs. Nas beef. It's time for Barkley to come back over the top - with his own \"Ether.\" What can he even say to equal the anguish of Nas' \"What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother; you traded your soul for riches. My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous, and now I smile like a proud dad watching his only son that made it.\" \nWe'll have to see if Barkley has the chops. For now, though, this was a takeover. Break's over.
