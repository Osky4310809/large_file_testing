The suspect’s motives were not immediately clear although another instance of attempt to instigate a \"false flag\" reaction appears the most likely explanation; he was being questioned by the international investigations unit of the Israeli police. \nAs the NYT adds, the inquiry was complicated by what the authorities described as the suspect’s use of “advanced camouflage technologies” to try to cover up his communications , which he made through the internet. When the Israeli police searched the suspect’s house, investigators confiscated computers, an antenna and other equipment . \nThe arrest took place after a months-long investigation in cooperation with the F.B.I. and other police and security agencies in the United States and Europe, the Israeli police said in a statement. \n“The investigation began in several countries at the same time, in which dozens of threatening calls were received at public places, events, synagogues and community buildings that caused panic and disrupted events and activities in various organizations,” the statement said. \n\nRepresentatives of the F.B.I. and police organizations from various other countries arrived in Israel to take part in the investigation, the statement said, adding that technology was used to track the suspect down. \nAs a reminder, over the past two months, dozens of Jewish community centers across the United States reported more than 100 bomb threats since the beginning of the year, with many in the media quick to accuse \"intolerance\" and \"anti-semitism\" spawned by Trump as the culprit behind the wave of threats. The calls, which President Trump condemned during an address to Congress last month, led to evacuations and bomb sweeps and heightened worries about anti-Semitism in the United States. \nAs it turns out it wasn't Trump at all, but people who may have been desperate to make Trump appear like he was, something which Trump himself suggested and, predictably, prompted another bout of furious reactions by the \"objective\" press, case in point this piece from WaPo: \nLooks like Trump, politically incorrect though he may be, was right again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:40:58.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
