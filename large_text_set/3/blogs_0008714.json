Depression has a range of causes, from traumatic experiences to chemical imbalances. But for Lo Bosworth, her depression was caused by a vitamin deficiency. \nAccording to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America , more than 40 million American adults, or 18% of the population, are affected by some form of anxiety disorder, with 6.7% of American adults experiencing at least one major depressive episode in the past year, according to a 2014 study by the association. \nI've been depressed. Sharing my story today about the crazy reason why and how I've come out the other side...on YT and @thelodownblog today (link on that account). \nA post shared by Lo Bosworth (@lobosworth) on Mar 10, 2017 at 10:21am PST \nThe former The Hills star has been largely silent about her depression until she opened up about her 16-month experience with depression on her blog, The Lo Down.\n‚ÄúI started feeling very off in the fall of ‚Äô15,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúRacing mind, impulsive behavior, insomnia. That all developed into a feeling of anxiety that lasted for almost 2 months without any relief. I mean, can you imagine having a 60-day long panic attack?‚Äù Lo says she tried everything from therapy to anti-depressants which she adjusted upwards of four times with no relief. When her doctors were confused at her lack of progress, they sent for a complex blood test to look at her vitamin levels. It turned out she had severe deficiencies in Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D. Finally, she had genetic testing done and learned she had mutations in the MTFHR gene, which instructs the body in making enzymes that create amino acids the body needs to metabolize and grow, and the MAOA gene, which affects neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.\nmy gorgeous familia happy Friday ü¶Ñü¶ã \nA post shared by Lo Bosworth (@lobosworth) on Mar 3, 2017 at 10:33am PST \nAnd just like each case of depression is unique, so is each treatment. Although Lo‚Äôs case was treated through vitamins like Blisphora (methylated Vitamin B12 with folate) and Vitamin D3 with K, this doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs everyones path. Instead, Lo‚Äôs honest post aims to encourage others to be their own advocate, seek the care they need, and figure out what‚Äôs right for them. And although the idea of self-care may have been watered down recently, the message is the same. Taking care of yourself, whether it‚Äôs simply going to therapy, showering and eating food, or trying to find the right treatment for your mental illness, is vital.\nMOON IN AQUARIUS What do I love about astrology? Each person's birth chart is utterly unique, like a fingerprint, which tells me that each and every one of us has a unique role to play in weaving the fabric of humanity. The trick? To live as the truest expression of YOU when there is so much pressure to conform to how you see others living and loving and being. Pressure that also makes it feel safer to play it that way. Aquarius is the part of our psyche that will always do it our way. Our rebel spirit.

But as we shed light on the different things that cause depression and anxiety disorders, we are also lifting the stigma for those living with these illnesses.
