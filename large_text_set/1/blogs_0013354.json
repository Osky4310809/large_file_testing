The artist has recently revealed an upcoming collaboration with Flying Lotus , announced an album with his backing band The Free Nationals and has implied that more of his solo work is imminent. Now it seems that he has made a song with Chance the Rapper, revealing this information along with a brief snippet of the track in a Snapchat video. Watch it below.\n\nThough it is relegated to the background, the upcoming song between the two artists sounds incredible, combining the elastic funk instrumentation of .Paak with Chance’s infectiously joyous rapping. This exact same energy is on display in the video, which sees the pair giggling in the recording studio while sipping cocktails. No word yet on where this song will appear, but rest assured we will be keeping our eyes out for it.\nIn case you missed it, we took Anderson .Paak on a little vintage clothes shopping trip. See what he ended up getting in the video below.\n\nIn other music news, Migos stopped by Kimmel last night for a performance of their number one single “Band and Boujeee.” Watch it right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T12:29:40.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
