But the musical had not, in fact, won the award. \"Moonlight\" did. Watch the dramatic and confusing end to the awards show. (Clip Courtesy A.M.P.A.S.© 2017) \nTwitter is having a field day following the most bizarre flub in Oscars history, when “La La Land” was mistakenly announced as best picture winner before the award was correctly given to the real winner, “Moonlight.” \nThe mix-up was an odd but thrilling cap to a more-than-three-hour broadcast. Adding to the tension was the fact that “Moonlight” and “La La Land,” long considered the favorites in the best picture category, couldn’t be more different. “La La Land” is an extravagant musical about Hollywood. “Moonlight” is a coming-of-age story that grapples with weightier issues including race, poverty, sexuality and drug addiction. \nIn the immediate aftermath, it was clear that no one knew exactly what happened, but that didn’t stop the Internet from trying to sort it all out. Here are some of the best reactions, which ranged from utter disbelief to more humorous takes. \nDisbelief \nHere’s Ryan Gosling looking surprised, but also amused.

He took a long look at the card before handing it over to Dunaway to read the winner. But, as he later explained, he was genuinely confused by the envelope, which read “Emma Stone, ‘La La Land.’ (Moments earlier, Stone had accepted the best actress award for the musical). That’s why I took such a long look at Faye,” Beatty told the audience. “I wasn’t trying to be funny,” I'm also very sad for the MOONLIGHT crew. I wish that they had the full experience of winning best pic without the awkwardness of it all. \n— Jessica Chastain (@jes_chastain) February 27, 2017 That is so inexcusable.
