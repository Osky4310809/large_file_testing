Remember Nissan’s Z-car? It has been around in current 370Z form for over eight years now, and we’re thankful/surprised that Nissan hasn’t already culled the brawny RWD sports car. \nNot just that, but a new one is coming to refresh the franchise. Car and Driver reports that a concept previewing the next-generation Z-car will be revealed at this year’s Tokyo Motor Show. \nThe motoring rag says that the future production Fairlady will have similar proportions to the outgoing coupe, which means a wide stance, long hood and pushed back cab (2011 Esflow Concept pictured above, illustration only). It adds that the next Z will sport edgier styling, including a gaping front end that takes cues from the GT-R facelift . Apparently, it will ride on a shorter wheelbase courtesy of the Infiniti Q60 ’s FR-L platform. \nIt is said that of the three powertrains that will be available, a twin-turbo 3.0 litre V6 from Infiniti’s Red Sport cars will be the flagship motor. The new VR engine makes 400 hp at 6,400 rpm and 475 Nm of torque from 1,600 to 5,200 rpm in the Q50 and Q60. It will be paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. \nThis boosted V6 engine is 700 cc smaller than the 370Z’s naturally aspirated VQ V6, and it’s lighter too. C/D mentions the Porsche 718 Boxster S and BMW M2 as possible rivals for the hottest Z. A tasty proposition. \nThe report adds that in addition to the flagship motor, an entry-level 3.0 litre V6 with 300 hp and a hybrid variant – expected to use the same V6 alongside an electric motor for up to 500 hp – are on the cards. Expect a new Fairlady Z in 2019, the report says. If correct, this is good news. \nGALLERY: 2011 Nissan Esflow Concept GALLERY: Nissan 370Z Nismo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T14:28:19.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
