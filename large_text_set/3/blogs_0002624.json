Rose Street. Police say during the traffic stop, officers recovered a loaded handgun and drugs from inside the vehicle. Investigators arrested 36-year-old Keith Gladden and took him to Central Booking and Intake Facility. \nPolice say Gladden is a repeat offender and is prohibited from possessing a firearm. \nThe gun looks particularly old-fashioned, but also has duct tape on the grip.
