Accordingly, Begovic has been looking for an exit from Stamford Bridge since January, with clubs from England showing interest in having his presence at their squads. One of the clubs apparently rumoured to be on the list of potential suitors for Begovic are West Ham, who currently have goalkeepers Adrián and Darren Randolph in the squad. But even though Begovic would certainly be an upgrade over those two, Slaven Bilic has ruled out an approach. \"We have been linked with many players in the last three transfer windows, including Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. In those three windows, though, I have said a few times that the only position in the team I have absolutely no interest in discussing is the goalkeeping spot. I was happy — and I am still happy — with Adrian and Darren Randolph.\" -Slaven Bilic; Source: London Evening Standard Though Bilic has removed his club from contention for Begovic's signature, there are surely plenty of clubs who have Begovic on their transfer radar for next summer. The tougher part might be Chelsea finding a back-up of similar quality, presence, and professionalism.
