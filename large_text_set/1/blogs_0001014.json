The ones that replaced all the ads in a tube station with giant pictures of cats ?), staging a full-on takeover of Clapham Common station.\nWhere there would usually be a bunch of different adverts dotted along the platform, next to escalators, and at the OysterCard and ticket barriers, there are now posters encouraging people to go vegan.\nThe posters feature pictures of cows, pigs, and chickens with the slogan: ‘I’m ME, Not MEAT.’\namazing that this is in the London Underground right now pic.twitter.com/PgXcgCYhjD \n— Kate Louise Powell Ⓥ (@KatePow3ll) January 2, 2017 \n\nThere are 60 adverts in the station in total, so it’s pretty full-on pro-vegan messaging.\nWhile some people are fans, others have dismissed the move as ‘vegan propaganda’.\nBut to be honest, it feels like many people are always ready to bash vegans.\nAt Clapham Common Tube station (UK) …. hope for the year ahead. pic.twitter.com/TIjXGtDV5i \n— Wisdom (@WisdomPepper) January 1, 2017 \n\nAnd while I’m not the biggest PETA fan (remember that time they focused their efforts on telling parents that eating chicken would make their son’s penis smal l? That was weird), these posters are pretty tame. At least they haven’t gone down the gruesome ‘see this cute pig? ITS TAIL WAS CUT OFF’ route.\nPETA hasn’t officially stated how long their Clapham Common takeover will go on, but it’d make sense if the posters stayed up for the whole of Veganuary.\n‘Cows, chickens, and pigs are no different from human beings when it comes to feeling pain and fear and valuing their lives,’ they explain on their website .\namazing that this is in the London Underground right now pic.twitter.com/PgXcgCYhjD \n— Kate Louise Powell Ⓥ (@KatePow3ll) January 2, 2017 \n\n‘By eating vegan, London commuters can spare sensitive animals daily suffering and a terrifying death in today’s industrialised meat, egg, and dairy industries – in which chickens’ and turkeys’ throats are cut while they’re still conscious and piglets’ tails are cut off without any painkillers.’\nMORE: Veganuary 2017: 21 delicious and warming vegan soups to try \nMORE: London is getting an all-vegan kebab spot \nMORE: 31 vegan recipes to get you through Veganuary ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T11:31:36.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
