By Jeffrey Matulef Published 21/03/2017 \nThe Xbox One is getting a classy new controller with Microsoft announcing a \"Tech Series\" of gamepads. \nThe first in the series is called the Xbox Wireless Controller - Recon Tech Special Edition. Due 25th April for $69.99 (or your local equivalent), this premium controller hosts a diamond-patterned rubber backing, a laser-etched texture on its face, and an improved wireless range with Bluetooth support. \n\"The Xbox team was inspired by military technology and performance patterns, exploring concepts stemming from combat armor and sci-fi mechanical gear,\" wrote Xbox Live director of programming Larry \"Major Nelson\" Hryb on the company blog . \nXbox social marketing manager Graeme Boyd tweeted the following close-ups of the new Tech Series controller: The new Xbox Recon Tech controller. Key things here: Laser-etched grips on the front and rubberised grips on the back ðOut next month. pic.twitter.com/RtCpWjJsSC — Graeme Boyd (@AceyBongos) March 21, 2017 \nLike any Xbox One controller, you'll be able to re-map buttons using the Xbox Accessories App, and later this year Xbox One will receive an update for a \"Copilot\" feature in which two controllers will act as one, should folks with disabilities want to play cooperatively with a friend wherein they each have their own gamepad.
