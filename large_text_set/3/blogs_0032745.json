Mirror Sport understands he is set to remain, but no announcement has been forthcoming from the club. \nBanners calling for the Frenchman to depart have become increasingly prevalent at matches, while a plane flew a ‘Wenger Out’ banner over the Hawthorns during the recent 3-1 defeat to West Brom.

And there has been suggestions that contract situations has led to distraction. \nWenger accepts that the current season has been disappointing, having earlier hailed his ‘best attack’ and been ready for a title tilt. \nBut he believes it is too easy to blame questions over his future for the Gunners slide.

I believe we are in a position where we do not have to find easy excuses. Our job is to perform. \n\"The worst you accuse me of, having done 20 years at the club, is creating instability. If I have created anything it is stability. The situation is not sorted out and I believe it's important we focus on what is essential. \n\"You know my attachment to this club and at the moment it is as it is and I do not see any escape route to have less responsibility because of that. You have to be men and focus on what matters and what is our job.\" Alexis Sanchez is out of contract in 15 months (Photo: PA) Arsenal defenders appeal as West Brom took advantage (Photo: PA Wire) \nThe Gunners defeat at West Brom last time out saw their display routinely picked apart by pundits, particularly their defending at set pieces. \nAnd Wenger says that, quite simply, his side are not defending anywhere near the standard necessary. \n\"You do not need to concede a corner because I have not signed a five-year contract. You defend on a corner no matter if your manager is has a one month or 10-year contract. We have to look at ourselves and believe in our qualities because if you look at our offensive numbers they are very positive in the league. \n\"We need to defend better and that's why we've lost some big games. When I say defend better it's not just the defenders it's the team as a whole. \n\"What's gone wrong? We don't defend well enough.\" Wenger still maintains the Gunners can land glory (Photo: Getty Images Europe) A Wenger Out banner at The Hawthorns (Photo: AFP) \nHowever, Wenger maintains that his side can still end the season on a high - with the FA Cup and a top four spot still within their grasp. \n\"We can still turn this around by the end of the season. It's a strange season because we played 20 games unbeaten and then you slip slightly away in one game, two games and suddenly it becomes a problem. \n\"It's not gone in the way we expected but it can still be an acceptable season. We still have a good chance to finish in the top four and we are in the semi-final of the FA Cup.\" poll loading Will this be Wenger's final season as Arsenal boss? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T12:05:13.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
