The powerful legend has been asked for since the Marvel Cinematic Universe began its trek into the stars with Thor and then Guardians of the Galaxy . This year, fervor over the cosmic being and other canon heroes has grown to an all-time high thanks to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 . The anticipated sequel is slated to hit theaters this summer, and fans continue to wonder if these sought-after characters will be introduced somehow. But, if you ask director James Gunn about it, then answer is no. \nTaking to Facebook , the director did a live Q&A video with fans and was asked about both Adam Warlock and Darkhawk . Rumors began to swirl the two characters may feature in the sequel after new Marvel Legends action figures were released. A slew of Guardians toys were debuted with a few non-cinematic pieces, but fans were quick to speculate the toys of Warlock and Darkhawk meant more. \nApparently, that’s not the case. \n\"I think it was not very well thought out because I'm getting questions about. 'Is Darkhawk in the movie because of the Marvel Legends figure? Is Adam Warlock in the movie because of the Marvel Legends figures?’” Gun said about the rumors. \n“All you need to do is look at the packaging, you guys. On the packaging cover, it says ' Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ' on the figures that are from the movie and it doesn't say Vol. 2 on the other figures. So that should tell you what's from the movie and what's not.” \nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos. The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill’s true parentage. Old foes become new allies and fan-favorite characters from the classic comics will come to our heroes’ aid as the Marvel cinematic universe continues to expand. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is written and directed by James Gunn (Slither). The film marks the return of the original Guardians, including Chris Pratt (Jurassic World) as Peter Quill/Star-Lord; Zoe Saldana (Star Trek Into Darkness) as Gamora; Dave Bautista (Spectre) as Drax; Vin Diesel (Furious 7) as the voice of Groot; Bradley Cooper (American Sniper) as the voice of Rocket; Michael Rooker (Jumper) as Yondu; Karen Gillan (The Big Short) as Nebula; and Sean Gunn (Gilmore Girls) as Kraglin. New cast members include Pom Klementieff (Oldboy), Elizabeth Debicki (The Great Gatsby, Everest), Chris Sullivan (The Knick, The Drop) and Kurt Russell (The Hateful Eight, The Thing). \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is scheduled to hit theaters on May 5, 2017.
