Idk. We’d probably Instagram it, Snapchat it, and Facebook it to death like most normal people would and then move on with our lives. What did Frances Bean Cobain do when she saw her face on a billboard for her new Marc Jacobs campaign? Ms. Cobain decided to deface her own face . Lol. What? But, wait, trust us, she did it lovingly and even got Jacobs’s approval afterward . Pretty cool, right?\nHere’s the billboard before, which is located above the Marc Jacobs flagship store in LA:\nFrances Bean Cobain by David Sims on top of our flagship store on 8400 Melrose Place, LA.

The text reads, “WITCH, WITCH, SHE’S A WITCH,” which could be a nod to her Instagram handle which is @space_witch666? No idea what the sheriff’s badge refers to. Interesting.\nHere she is in the act!

Marc said of Cobain in an Instagram post a couple of months ago:\n“I first met Frances Bean when she was 2-years-old at a dinner with her mom (Courtney) and Anna Sui in 1994 at Bar Six in NYC. I have always wanted to work with Frances. Her beauty, uniqueness, and strength is something I have long admired and respected. Few things remain as constant as my continued inspiration from those whose honesty, integrity, courage, and curiosity lead them to explore and venture beyond preconceived boundaries.”\nSo cute. We’re loving the love between them .\n\"I first met Frances Bean when she was 2 years old at a dinner with her mom (Courtney) and Anna Sui in 1994 at Bar Six in NYC.

She told Vogue earlier this year that modeling is “100 percent” out of her comfort zone and that she wouldn’t have done it with another designer.\n“I thought this collection was great,” she said, “and I was flattered that Marc thought of me for this. What I said to Marc when I was saying yes was that he’s an underdog for the masses. He’s still very rebellious within the fashion world, and he’s been like that his entire career.”\nWe can’t wait to see what you do next!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:54:39.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
