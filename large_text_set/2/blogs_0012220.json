Two thirds of American men will experience some form of hair loss by the age of 35, and 85 percent of men will have significantly thinning hair by the age of 50, according to the American Hair Loss Association. The real cause of hair loss is still unclear, but U.K. scientists might be one step closer to understanding why it’s so prevalent. A new study from the University of Edinburgh has identified 287 genetic regions linked to baldness , most of them related to hair structure and development. \nThis is the largest study of its kind: Researchers examined the genomic and health data of more than 52,000 men in the U.K. After analyzing their genes, they discovered that a good chunk of the genetic variants came from the X chromosome men inherit from their mothers, meaning your sex hormones could be interacting with your hair proteins—possibly increasing your risk for hair loss, the researchers say.
