Is it a good day? No, but it’s better than it was before! \nThe song (and others!) will be released in March as part of a 30th anniversary reissue of the 1987 album Tango in the Night . Though both versions are unmistakably of the ‘80s, this one is moodier, with an acoustic guitar standing in for what would later be swapped out for zippy, over-the-top synths. Stevie Nicks’s vocals are also dusted with a soulful grit that seems to have been scrubbed out during production of the later version, which I’ll probably never listen to again. Put simply, this one is better.

The deluxe edition will feature other previously unheard recordings, like an alternate version of “Mystified” and a demo of “Tango In the Night.” \nIf that wasn’t enough, Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie have plans to release an album of duets, tentatively titled Buckingham McVie . I don’t even care if it’s not good, I can’t wait.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:31:48.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
