US was sure about Hussein possessing WMD in the same way .” ???? ????: ??? ? ?? \" \" ? . ??? ???? ??? ?? ? ??? ? . \n— (@Alexey_Pushkov) January 6, 2017 \nHe continued his criticism on Twitter, adding that \" the U.S. democratic process was undermined not by Russia, but by the Obama administration and mass media, which supported [Hillary] Clinton over [President-elect Donald] Trump .\" \nHe proceeded to slam Obama as responsible for the Republicans' growing trust of Putin, stating that \"the danger to democracy is within U.S. itself.\" . ? ??? ?? , ? ???. ? ???, ?-?? . - ???. \n— (@Alexey_Pushkov) January 6, 2017 \nThe Russian politician also criticized the Obama administration's allegation that Putin caused a decline in Russo-American relations, calling such a position \"complete nonsense.\" \"Obama took the course to isolate and undermine Russian positions, and Putin is to blame.\" \nFranz Klintsevich, the first deputy chairman of the Defense and Security Committee of the Russian parliament's upper house, added fuel to the fire, saying the U.S. intelligence community made unfounded allegations of Russia-sponsored hacker attacks, in favor of the outgoing US presidential administration and made a fool of itself. \nSpeaking to RIA Novosti , the senator said that the allegations \"simply make no sense. The main reason is that no one can interfere with the electoral process in such country as the United States,\" he pointed out. \"Acting in favor of the outgoing presidential administration, the US intelligence community laid itself open to ridicule.\" \nOther Russians agreed such as Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, a state-funded television network that broadcasts in English, who is cited repeatedly in the report, posted her own message on Twitter scoffing at the American intelligence community’s accusations. “Aaa, the CIA report is out! Laughter of the year! Intro to my show from 6 years ago is the main evidence of Russia’s influence at US elections. This is not a joke!” she wrote. \nEven Russians who have been critical of their government voiced dismay at the United States intelligence agencies’ account of an elaborate Russian conspiracy unsupported by solid evidence. Alexey Kovalyov, a Russian journalist who has followed and frequently criticized RT, said he was aghast that the report had given so much attention to the television station. “I do have a beef with RT and their chief,” Mr. Kovalyov wrote in a social media post, “But they are not your nemesis, America. Please chill.” \nThe Kremlin, which has in the past repeatedly denied any role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee computer system, had no immediate response to the declassified report. Putin instead made a show of business as usual, attending a church service to mark the start of Orthodox Christmas. \nHis composure was understandable because as the NYT again remarkably notes, \" The report provides no new evidence to support assertions that Moscow meddled covertly through hacking and other actions to boost the electoral chances of Donald J. Trump and undermine his rival, Hillary Clinton, but rests instead on what it describes as Moscow’s long record of trying to influence America’s political system .\" \nIn other words, speculation and innuendo. Curiously, the NYT's bashing of the report continued: \nThe public report did not include evidence on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates that intelligence officials said was in a classified version. \nThe NYT also cited Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian intelligence agencies at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, who said he was skeptical of the accusation that Putin had ordered the hacking. All the same, he added, Russian spies, like their Soviet predecessors, “don’t just collect information but try to assert influence.” United States intelligence operatives, he said, have often done the same thing but the Russians, convinced that the United States orchestrated protests in Ukraine in 2014 that toppled the pro-Moscow president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and other popular uprisings in former Soviet lands, “have a more aggressive approach to meddling in other people’s politics.” \nThe NYT continued: \"Galeotti, the intelligence expert in Prague, cautioned that this mission to influence foreign politics was not a uniquely Russian phenomenon but had also been embraced in the past by the C.I.A., which, in the 1950s, sought to shape and subvert politics in countries like Iran and Guatemala .\" \nActually, and this is the real punchline, there is an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to US involvement in overthrowing foreign regimes.
