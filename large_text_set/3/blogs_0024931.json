Now, word breaks via Variety that the film — titled Wingmen — will also be directed by Gordon-Levitt, marking his second directorial feature after 2013’s Don Jon . Wingmen originated from a story by Gordon-Levitt and 21 Jump Street scribe Michael Bacall. According to the trade, the storyline follows two pilots who make a crash landing in Las Vegas. The article likens the tone of Wingmen to both Pitch Perfect and The Book of Mormon with the soundtrack set to feature Top 100 hits. \nRELATED: Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt to Co-Star in Musical Comedy \nAlthough Gordon-Levitt and Tatum have been attached to Wingmen for awhile, Gordon-Levitt had not always been planning to also direct. \n“The thing is, that’s going to be really challenging performance-wise,” the star told CinemaBlend last year when asked if might consider helming. “We really want to rehearse and really, really push ourselves as far as the performance. Directing is very time consuming. So, I mean, you wouldn’t be able to be in full-day dance rehearsals at the same time as planning your shots and meeting with production designers and stuff like that.” \nThings appear to have changed recently, however, and Wingmen is heading into development at Universal Pictures with Gordon-Levitt in the director’s chair. Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions are attached to produce Wingmen alongside Gordon Levitt through his HitRecord Films and Tatum through his Free Association (alongside creative partners Reid Carolin and Peter Kiernan). Universal’s senior VP of production Kristin Lowe is overseeing for the studio. \nDoes Wingmen sound like a project you’ll want to check out on the big screen?
