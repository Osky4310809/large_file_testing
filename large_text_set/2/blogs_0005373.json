According to the scheme, individuals who choose to participate will learn through conferences, seminars and workshops, facility tours, site-based experiences, and group projects. \nThe GETS project is in tandem with the four cardinal objectives of Royal Academy of Engineering Global Challenge Research Fund (GCRF), Africa Catalyst Award and part of Energy Institute’s Continuing Professional Development (CPD) program, a point-based programme designed for students, graduates and young professionals to encourage continuous training, learning and development of engineering professionals within the energy industry throughout their careers. \nCommenting on the scheme, Yewande Abiose, the Managing Director of Energy Institute Nigeria said, “The scheme will focus on developing well-rounded energy and power engineers with technical know-how to generate clean and reliable sources of power that can be used in Nigerian communities. \n“Our long-term goal is to develop sustainable and renewable power supply sources (solar, bio-mass and alternative sources) to add to Nigeria’s existing on-grid sources of power and also off-grid sources to local communities, thereby providing assistance in meeting the power generation targets of Nigeria with a net effect of spurring industrialization, entrepreneurship and economic development” she added. \nPrincipal Patner, LONADEK, Dr Ibilola Amao, said the Scheme includes site/field work, HSSE and QA/QC which are not currently part of the curriculum of higher learning institutions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:09:08.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
