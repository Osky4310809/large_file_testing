Imaginary Air Race On A Flying Mattress \nA couple of years ago, I decided I’d take 25 mg of Ambien for shits and giggles. Pretty soon, I was having the time of my life sitting in my chair with my eyes closed, because whenever I closed my eyes, I would feel the chair take off like a plane and fly really fast. My mattress did the same thing. In fact, I had an imaginary air-race on my flying mattress against my cool new friends who had materialized through the wall earlier that night. It wasn’t so much a hallucination as it was a vivid waking dream. \nAmbien is some fucking crazy stuff. 8. Had Sex With My BF…Don’t Remember It \nI only took it once as a test so that I could maybe take it a couple of days later for a red-eye flight. \nSpent the night with bleak dreams, not quite nightmares, but depressing things where everyone was angry and shouted at me all the time. \nHad sex in the morning with my bf (apparently), but can’t remember anything about it. Spent the entire day after feeling miserable, like a full-blown, stuck-inside-your-head-hating-yourself depression. It took me until close to dinner time to figure out it was probably that one sleeping pill. 9. Teddy Bear Rescue \nI started taking Ambien a couple months back to help get more restful sleep. The first night I took it I hallucinated that all of the clothes in my closet had turned into zombies that were planning a sneaky attack on me. It was so weird, I could see them whispering to one another. At one point I remembered my child hood teddy bear was trapped in the closet with the zombies and I needed to rescue him. I bust out my iPhone, call my best friend to fill him in on the situation and proceed to turn on the light saber app and swing my phone back and forth at the closet. I managed to snatch my teddy bear and go to sleep after a little bit. 10. A Brilliant Idea, Triple The Dosage \nI’d take a pill then wake up a few hours later for the rest of the night. After about 80 hours on 6 hours of rest, I had a brilliant idea 1 pill = 3 hours so 3 pills = 9 hours. \nI woke up and my bed was in a Louisiana swamp and 6 men in masks were picking it up and carrying me away. Luckily, my laptop was handy so I picked it up and got on AIM and started messaging everyone about what I was seeing. Except, the keys were floating off the keyboard and I was having to reach for them to type my pleas for help. The next day a friend of mine came over after having printed our conversation. He said he almost called 911 to have someone pick me up so I could sober up in the hospital. \nI think it’s dreams like those that inspired the Rozerum commercial. Seconds after the first time I saw it, I called my psychiatrist and asked him to write me an RX. After about a week, I was getting regular sleep. 11. “Slap A Saddle On It, Cowgirl!” \nAmbien makes me horny. I was half asleep on my back with a stiffy. Wife looks at me and says, “Woah, Cowboy, look at you!” \nI don’t recall, but she told me I said to her, “Slap a saddle on it Cowgirl, ride it into town and tell all your friends about it.” 12. Yoo-Hoo!!! \nMy son’s girlfriend coming down the stairs at 1:30am with NO eyebrows and demanding I take her to get a yoo-hoo, louder and louder….. 13. Car Wreck Dream \nI got an Ambien scrip my Junior year of college because I was a severe night owl. This is what happened on the last two pills of that bottle… \nI took one at about 9PM at home with the hopes of getting a good night sleep. It wasn’t really knocking me out by about 10PM so I took another. I remember walking upstairs and lying in bed. \nI wake up the next day thinking about that crazy dream I had. I wanted some cigarettes but the store near me was closed so I drove about 10 minutes away to a gas station (also closed). There was a lot of snow on the ground so I missed the entrance and hit the curb, popping my tire. I get out, jack the car up and fix the tire. I’ve never done it before so I call AAA and have them look at it. After he comes and looks at it (this parts fuzzy) I drive home I guess. \nWhen I wake up I laugh about how ridiculous this dream was. I don’t know how to fix a tire, let alone when I’m wacked out on Ambien. I walk outside to go get some lunch and see the spare on my car. It wasn’t a dream. \nMy car had a bent control arm and was barely able to make it down my driveway. The wheel had to be turned 90 degrees to even drive straight. I have no idea how I got home. 14. “My Brain Is Like The Keebler Elf Tree And You’re One Of The Elves” \nYou are supposed to take the ambien and then go straight to bed. Not wait around and have giggly fun time until you pass out. Having said that, I was guilty of calling my friends and having conversations about important things while waiting for the ambien to kick in. One of my friends started making a list of the weird things I would say. Example: “My brain is like the Keebler Elf tree and you’re one of the elves.” 15. A Piece Of Meat On A Grill \nThe first (and last) time I took Ambien it made me all anxious and not at all sleepy. As I was tossing and turning in bed I thought I was a piece of meat on a grill being endlessly flipped from one side to the other forever. \nA friend had a similar much more pleasant experience in which she was a clam tucked cozily into the “shell” of her bedsheets. 16. The Eye Of Sauron \nOh lord, my ambien story is hilarious. So, the first time I took ambien, I absolutely tripped balls. I popped the pill, started getting ready for bed, sat down on the edge of the bed and remembered I forgot to turn my heater on. So I go over to the heater and the pill kicks in. \nI sit down cause I feel woosy and turn my heater on. The red light letting me know that it is on turns into the Eye of Sauron. I try to stand up and the heater (now the Eye of Sauron) begins to tower over me, so I sit down. Every time I stand, the heater towers over me, so I am stuck in this loop of sitting and standing. \nI begin to tell the heater to keep me warm throughout the night as I crawl my way over to my bed. As I stand to crawl into bed to finally sleep, the wall begins to morph into tentacles that proceeded to wrap around me and keep me snug as I slept. 17. “I Thought I Was A Gardener” \nI once took ambien when I was dating an ex boyfriend of mine. I was having a lot of trouble sleeping so, he gave me one of his pills. I had never taken anything like that before. After I took it, I shortly fell asleep. Well, I thought I fell asleep. At this time, he lived in an apartment and shared a room with another person. While I thought I was sound asleep, I was apparently trying to pick flowers off the ceiling all night. I thought I was Gardener. I was also talking so loud about my new florist job, I kept the entire room awake all night. Good times. Thanks, Benjamin. 18. He Flushed The Pills After This \nNot a funny story. \nMy dad’s doctor prescribed him ambien (I don’t know the reason) and he had a few incidents of sleep walking, but nothing big until one day I was visiting my mom when he shows up on her doorstep and knocks. I opened the door to find him standing shirtless on the porch with his car parked with the front in her yard and the back in the street with every door open. \nI drove him home and finally managed to get him inside after he fell and scraped himself up on the way out of the car. Came in to find our pantry door absolutely demolished and the couch flipped backwards. Tried to figure out what happened from my dad but he just kept mumbling about some party (which I still don’t think ever actually happened) so I finally got him to sit and watch TV for a little bit before he consented to letting me help him to his room. \nI slept on his couch that day and he was thoroughly confused when he woke up that morning and found me there. He told me that he took the pills, went to bed, and had no recollection whatsoever of the events that night. \nOnce I filled him in on what happened he flushed the rest of the pills and called his doctor to tell her what happened and told her that he would no longer be using it. \nHe also informed me that a month prior there had been an incident where he didn’t remember driving to work and only came to when he bumped a pole in his workplace’s parking lot. 19. Going To The Gym \nI took it for a while in high school back when I was misdiagnosed with insomnia [I have DSPD, which is largely unresponsive to sleeping pills]. One night I just could. not. sleep. So instead of my usual 3 pills [I had quite the tolerance because of the DSPD], I took 4. Still nothing. So then I took another. Nothing. After taking 6 and being awake for I believe 32 straight hours, I decided it would be a great idea to drive to the gym – but I didn’t really know how to drive. So after a few minutes I ran the car into a bus bench and the city ended up having to tear it (the bus bench, not the car) out because I’d completely destroyed it. \nI went off it cold turkey after that and stayed awake for the most miserable 58 hours of my life. 20. Blood Splattered Everywhere \nWork started at 4pm. I woke up in bed at 4:37 feeling horrible and groggy as hell. Saw the time and got up to take a quick shower. When I walked into the bathroom, there was blood splattered everywhere. Floor, walls, toilet, but mostly on the counter by the sink. I looked at it all for about 10 seconds, then hurried up and got to work. \nI evidently looked pretty fucked up when I got to work, both physically and mentally. My nose felt really weird too, kinda half numb. I went home sick after about 2 hours since I wasn’t really able to function. For some reason I called my mom before I went home, and she said I sounded really drugged out. When I got home I slept for 6 hours, and woke up feeling mostly normal. \nI have no idea exactly what happened as I simply have no memory of it at all. What I was able to piece together from the evidence (mostly blood splatters) is I got up for work at a normalish time. I went to the bathroom to get ready, was standing in front of the sink, and simply passed out. On the way down, my face smashed into the edge of the counter. I somehow did not break my nose but did give it the worst nosebleed ever. This woke me back up, and I kinda writhed about in pain which spread blood everywhere. I then managed to get back to bed, laid down, and properly passed out there. \nThere’s still a tiny bit of nerve damage or something because one side of my nose is slightly numb all the time. I did not have this prior, which leads me to believe the face-smashing incident happened. 2 days later I told my doctor what had happened and that I wasn’t going to take Ambien anymore. \nThis was ~4 years ago and I still have sleeping problems, but at least my face is intact. 21. Lots Of Damage Control \nMoved to NYC and my partying 4-5 nights a week was destroying my sleep schedule, so I went to a doctor with a loose prescription pad. Ambien initially helped, but I soon wasn’t sleeping after I took it. I didn’t sleep walk, I sleep lived. One night I popped my pill and went to bed, but woke up at a girl’s house (wife now) naked to her telling me she’s on her way to the airport to Japan and to make sure the door locks when I leave. \nI sleep another hour or so then get on back to my apt. I get home and open the fridge to get something to drink and it is stocked with all my favorite shit: cut pineapple, honeydew, mango, Coconut water, etc. I think to myself ‘since when did they (cheap roomates) start buying this stuff. Later on that day I ask who bought the groceries they tell me I did. I check my pants pockets and find grocery receipt and multiple cab receipts. Check my phone and there are calls to multiple people, some lengthy convos. This kind of shit happens a few more times. Going out to bars meeting friends for drinks. Getting women’s phone numbers never remembering any of it. Well it feels like a distant dream that you’ve forgotten. Lots of text messages and phone convos that cause major regret. Lots of damage control. \nNever take that shit anymore. Almost forgot. I’ve slept sitting up, randomly taken clothes off when out of town guest are staying over. 22. He Shot Through His Own Front Door \nMy dad’s friend got the key to his gun safe, took a pistol, and shot through his front door because in his dream someone was breaking in. His wife took the gun and forced him awake until it wore off then got rid of the rest of it. 23. From NYC To Frankfurt, Germany \nI took some right after boarding a plane for an overnight flight from NYC to Frankfurt, Germany, later connecting to Beirut, Lebanon. \nEverything was fine until I decided to stay up an extra 10 minutes because they were serving Chicken and Mashed Potatoes for dinner. \nBy the time the Stewardess got to my seat, I was hallucinating; half of the plane had shifted downwards and the other half had levitated up. The food cart was god knows where. At one point, the entire plane looked like that scene in Fight Club where Ed Norton imagines everyone getting sucked out into the emergency exit, except everything was neon-colored. \nI managed to fall asleep, but when I woke up in Frankfurt the guy sitting next to me just shook his head and got outta there as soon as he could.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:10:36.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
