And the Premier League trophy had been handed over to Wes Morgan and his manager, to fireworks and fanfare all round. \nI interviewed Jamie Vardy and some of his team-mates down on the turf, and the greatest football story told in years reached an end and gave us all a warm, fuzzy feeling about our game again. \nThat’s why when Foxes owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha did wield the axe on Thursday it was such a joke. \nAlthough, sadly, the act was ­symptomatic of the greedy and ill-thought-out nature of the game. It was modern football in a nutshell.

And Ranieri’s players should hang their heads for having in the most ­callow of fashions let down the man who made them Premier League champions. \nIn May last year, Srivaddhanaprabha was talking about raising the stadium capacity to 43,000, about this being a ‘five-year project’ at the end of which Ranieri would groom the next manager. \nYet like so many words spoken in football, his were ultimately hollow. \nI will not pretend I was a massive Ranieri fan before he arrived at ­Leicester. Or that I foresaw what he would do at my old club.

The squad is much ­better now than when he arrived. \nBut Leicester’s big names, men Ranieri helped to become big names, have let him down. \nOnly Kasper Schmeichel can come out of the season with any credit for his performances.
