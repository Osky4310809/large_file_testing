But in the end, the Bears did what they've done all season. \nThey won. \nThey won again and for the 15th straight time. \nSo barring some combination of stupidity and stubbornness from Associated Press voters, Baylor will move to No. 1 in the AP poll for the first time in school history Monday. That's the result of Saturday's 61-57 victory over Oklahoma State . \nHere are three takeaways: \n1. There was nothing simple about it \nBaylor trailed 30-25 at halftime and 48-47 with less than eight minutes to play. And the Bears only led 58-56 with 36 seconds remaining. So this was never not-close. And Baylor had to overcome a lot -- including Phil Forte making five of the seven 3-pointers he attempted for Oklahoma State. But the Bears did it. They still won. Out of 351 Division I teams, only Baylor and Gonzaga still have a zero in the loss column. \n2. Jonathan Motley was good again \nMotley finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes, giving him four straight double-doubles and six for the season. The junior forward is averaging 15.8 points and 9.4 rebounds. He's on track to become Baylor's first first- or second-team AP All-American since Terry Teagle was a second-team selection in 1982. \n3. Baylor absolutely deserves the No. 1 ranking \nThe Bears have zero losses and seven top-55 KenPom wins. Here's some context: Nobody has fewer losses. Nobody has as many top-55 KenPom wins. \nSo it doesn't matter what you like or value. \nBaylor checks the boxes. \nThe Bears are unblemished with victories over Louisville, Oregon, Xavier, Iowa State, Oklahoma State, Michigan State and VCU. They're legit good. They're one of only five teams with a top-15 offensive efficiency rating and a top-15 defensive efficiency rating. And they've got the best resume in the country undeniably. \nIt's an amazing story, all things considered. \nThe Bears had zero Top 25 votes in the preseason. \nBut they should be atop all college basketball polls Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T10:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T06:01:49.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
