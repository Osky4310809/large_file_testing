London Life Fledgling ‘food theatre’ company wins £50,000 advertising prize from Evening Standard and Prince’s Trust \nJacopo Sarzi pitched his Food Design Lab idea to a ‘Dragons’ panel at today's Young Progress Makers event Wednesday 25 January 2017 19:31 BST Click to followES Lifestyle Jacopo Sarzi, founder of Food Design Lab (Sarzi) Sarzi \nThe Evening Standard and The Prince’s Trust today awarded one talented Londoner with a £50,000 advertising prize that will help to to launch their business idea. \nFive talented entrepreneurs aged between 18 and 25 were invited to pitch their ideas to a panel of so-called ‘Dragons’ at the Evening Standard’s Young Progress Makers event at The Roundhouse, but it was Jacopo Sarzi’s fledgling idea for an experimental dining experience company that the judges chose to award. \nFood Design Lab hosts gastronomical experiences, where the venue is designed to match the menu - from the furniture to the crockery. \nSarzi will receive advertising worth £50,000 with ESI Media (Evening Standard & Independent). They will also benefit from one-on-one mentoring from panel members and 12 months’ free working space from The Office Group whose CEO, Charlie Green, is one of the judges. Sadiq Khan: Young Londoners can achieve extraordinary things \nJoining Green to judge the pitches were Jim Armitage, City Editor of the London Evening Standard, Paul Brown, Director of Marketing at the Prince’s Trust, Brent Hoberman, founder of Lastminute.com and Smruti Sriram, founder of Supreme Creations. \nPaul Brown, communications director at The Prince’s Trust which is helped to draw up the shortlist, said the event offers a chance to boost a grassroots business. He said: “We’ve been helping young people to set up in business for over 30 years and, since then, we’ve supported 85,000 young entrepreneurs to get their businesses off the ground. The Prince’s Trust provides access to finance for young people who might struggle to get support elsewhere, and our volunteer mentors work with young people for up to three years. \n“We thought the Young Progress Makers event was a brilliant opportunity to give the winning business a real kick-start. Young entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of London’s economy and need all the support they can get.” \nThe pitching forum was just one part of today’s Young Progress Makers event. Designers, entrepreneurs, tech innovators, public figures and politicians including Mayor Sadiq Khan gave talks, took part in workshops and contributed to panel discussions about the challenges facing young Londoners today. \nFollow us on Twitter @eslifeandstyle and Instagram @standard.lifestyle More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:59:28.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
