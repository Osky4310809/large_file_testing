Convictions \nOne incident, which occurred in 2000 in the East Sussex town of Northiam where Masood lived with his first wife and children, left victim Piers Mott’s face slashed.

His widow said on Friday her late husband had been defending a friend at a pub when the incident happened. She denied Masood’s claims the row had “racial overtones”. \nMasood received a two-year sentence but three years later stabbed another man in the face following a street row. He was sent once again to prison, emerging from this stint as a convert to Islam named Khalid. Aliases \nThe 52-year-old was born Adrian Elms in Dartford, Kent on Christmas Day 1964 to then single mother Janet Elms. The identity of his father is not yet known. Khalid Masood, pictured as Adrian Ajao, during his school years at Huntley School for Boys in Tunbridge Wells, Kent Khalid Masood, pictured as Adrian Ajao in 1980, while still at school \nNow known as Janet Ajao, 69, after taking her husband’s surname, his mother last night declined to comment when approached, The Sun reported. \nA classmate remembered him as having a “big personality”. “Everyone liked him,” Kenton Till told the Telegraph. \nHe adopted his step-father’s surname to become Adrian Ajao while at school, before later converting to Islam and changing his name to Khalid Masood after his second stint in jail. \nHis convictions for violent crimes go as far back as 1983, according to reports. \nIt was confirmed on Thursday that Masood was once investigated by MI5 but considered a “peripheral” figure “not part of the current intelligence picture”. Teaching \nHe had lived in Saudi Arabia in 2005 and is thought to have become a self-styled tutor, teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL). \nBy 2006 he was back in Britain living in Crawley, Sussex, but again lived in Saudi between 2008-9 before returning once more this time to Luton, Bedfordshire. \nHe is believed to have set up his own tutoring business in 2012, based in Birmingham, the location of recent police raids and where Masood most recently lived. \nHe is believed to have rented a car from the city to carry out his act of terror.

Fourth victim Leslie Rhodes has yet to be pictured \nAnd earlier this year, just months before launching this week’s attack, Masood wrote an updated CV. \n“Friendly and approachable, as well as being a good listener, I believe that variety, interactivity, creativity and fun are the most effective ways to classroom participation,” he wrote according to The Sun. \n“Therefore, since I am enthusiastic and committed to my TEFL profession, I am now seeking a position where I can develop my career and skills to their full potential.” \nOne neighbour near to Masood’s most recent home said the killer used to help jumpstart her car. “He was [a nice guy] to me, so I’m shocked,” Kaodi Campbell said. \nTen people have been arrested in connection with the attack at a range of address in the West Midlands and London. \nAnyone with information is asked to contact the anti-terrorist hotline .
