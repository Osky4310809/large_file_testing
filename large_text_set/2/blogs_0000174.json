TechCrunch has confirmed the move with several trusted sources and learned that Microsoft will occupy 50,000 square feet in One Campus Martius, a building owned in part by Dan Gilbert and home to a large chunk of the Quicken Loans team. \nMicrosoft’s Detroit team is currently housed in suburban Southfield, Mich. The staff is mostly sales people. It’s unknown at this time if the entire Southfield workforce will be relocated to this new location. \nThe announcement is scheduled for tomorrow morning, February 3rd, at 9:00 am EST. \nDuring my chat with Dan Gilbert at CES 2017, he announced that a major tech firm was moving downtown but wouldn’t say who. He talked about his quest to turn Detroit into a financial technology hub and Microsoft nabbing a location there, even though it’s mostly a sales office, goes a long way to support that effort. Gilbert has long claimed his largest company, Quicken Loans, is a tech firm rather than a mortgage provider. \nSince moving his company downtown in 2011, Dan Gilbert has been snapping up real estate at a rapid pace. He’s also trying to construct new buildings, claiming there is a lack of workable office space. And now, after Microsoft moves in, there will be even less.
