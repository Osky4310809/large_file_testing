The teenage girl looked disheveled. She refused to make eye contact. And she wouldn’t speak to the flight crew — the well-dressed man she sat with spoke for her. \n“Something in the back of my mind said something was not right,” Frederick told WTSP . He was well-dressed. That’s what got me because I thought why is he well-dressed and she is looking all disheveled and out of sorts?” \nFrederick left her a note in one of the bathrooms. The young girl responded, “I need help.” \nThe pilot called the police, who were ready and waiting by the time the plane touched down in San Francisco. 2 WTSP \nFrederick is now sharing her incredible story, which happened back in 2011, with other flight crews. She hopes to save as many sex trafficking victims as possible by teaching air travel workers to recognize the signs and take action. \nShe trains her students to identify the indicators of potential human trafficking, including children or adults who appear bruised or drugged, a passenger traveling with someone who doesn’t appear to be a parent or relative, and one passenger speaking on behalf of another and not letting them out of their sight. \nFrederick recently taught a class of 100 flight attendants in Houston. The large, private events that come with the Super Bowl can lead to an unsettling increase in sex trafficking. 3 iStock \nWith 2,000 human trafficking workers arrested in the U.S. within the last year, it is an ever-important skill for flight crews to pick up. And one that Frederick regrets not learning sooner. \n“I’ve been a flight attendant for 10 years,” she said, “and it’s like I am going all the way back to when I was in training, and I was like, I could have seen these young girls and young boys and didn’t even know.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:47:30.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
