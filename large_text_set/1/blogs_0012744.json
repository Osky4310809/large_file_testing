Sometimes, the price of a military weapon or vehicle is shown to give perspective of how much money is needed to fund a war. In Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare , all the sayings are related to the storyline of the game. Here are all of the quoted sayings shown in Call of Duty Series. Quotes were not used in Call of Duty: World at War , Call of Duty: Black Ops , Call of Duty: Black Ops II , Call of Duty: Ghosts , Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare , and Call of Duty: Black Ops III . These quotes are also seen when the player finishes a level successfully, such as in Call of Duty 2 . \" Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. \" — Winston Churchill \" Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. \" — Winston Churchill \" In war there is no prize for the runner-up. \" — General Omar Bradley \" Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants.

There is no task that is more important or closer to my heart. \" — Albert Einstein \" War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature, and has no chance of being free unless made or kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. \" — John Stuart Mill \" Future years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background, the countless minor scenes and interiors of the secession war; and it is best they should not. The real war will never get in the books. \" — Walt Whitman \" There's no honorable way to kill, no gentle way to destroy. There is nothing good in war.

Patton \" Never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime. \" — Ernest Hemingway \" Every man's life ends the same way. It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another. \" — Ernest Hemingway \" All wars are civil wars, because all men are brothers. \" — Francois Fenelon \" I have never advocated war except as a means of peace. \" — Ulysses S. Grant \" Older men declare war. But it is the youth that must fight and die. \" — Herbert Hoover \" Only the dead have seen the end of war. \" — Plato \" Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily. \" — Napoleon Bonaparte \" It is well that war is so terrible, or we should get too fond of it. \" — Robert E. Lee \" A soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon. \" — Napoleon Bonaparte \" He who fears being conquered is sure of defeat. \" — Napoleon Bonaparte \" You must not fight too often with one enemy, or you will teach him all your art of war. \" — Napoleon Bonaparte \" There's a graveyard in northern France where all the dead boys from D-Day are buried. The white crosses reach from one horizon to the other. I remember looking it over and thinking it was a forest of graves. But the rows were like this, dizzying, diagonal, perfectly straight, so after all it wasn't a forest but an orchard of graves. Nothing to do with nature, unless you count human nature. \" — Barbara Kingsolver \" If we don't end war, war will end us. \" — H. G. Wells \" From my rotting body, flowers shall grow and I am in them and that is eternity. \" — Edvard Munch \" He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare, And he who has one enemy will meet him everywhere. \" — Ali ibn-Abi-Talib \" For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast, And breathed in the face of the foe as he pass'd; And the eyes of the sleepers wax'd deadly and chill, And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still! \" — George Gordon Byron, The Destruction of Sennacherib \" They wrote in the old days that it is sweet and fitting to die for one's country. But in modern war, there is nothing sweet nor fitting in your dying. You will die like a dog for no good reason. \" — Ernest Hemingway \" There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell. You can bear this warning voice to generations yet to come. I look upon war with horror. \" — General William Tecumseh Sherman \" War is as much a punishment to the punisher as it is to the sufferer. \" — Thomas Jefferson \" War would end if the dead could return. \" — Stanley Baldwin \" When you have to kill a man it costs nothing to be polite. \" — Winston Churchill \" Battles are won by slaughter and maneuver. The greater the general, the more he contributes in maneuver, the less he demands in slaughter. \" — Winston Churchill \" History will be kind to me for I intend to write it. \" — Winston Churchill \" We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender. \" — Winston Churchill \" When you get to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on. \" — Franklin D. Roosevelt \" A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is brave five minutes longer. \" — Ralph Waldo Emerson \" Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail. \" — Ralph Waldo Emerson \" The characteristic of a genuine heroism is its persistency. All men have wandering impulses, fits and starts of generosity. But when you have resolved to be great, abide by yourself, and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself with the world. The heroic cannot be the common, nor the common the heroic. \" — Ralph Waldo Emerson \" If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves. \" — Joseph Stalin \" The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his. \" — General George S. Patton \" Better to fight for something than live for nothing. \" — General George S. Patton \" Courage is fear holding on a minute longer. \" — General George S. Patton \" We happy few, we band of brothers/For he today that sheds his blood with me/Shall be my brother. \" — William Shakespeare,’’ King Henry V’’ \" Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. \" — William Shakespeare, ‘’Julius Caesar’’ \" Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake. \" — Napoleon Bonaparte \" There are only two forces in the world, the sword and the spirit.

Edison \" There are no atheists in foxholes, this isn't an argument against atheism, it's an argument against foxholes. \" — James Morrow \" Live as brave men; and if fortune is adverse, front its blows with brave hearts. \" — Cicero \" Courage and perseverance have a magical talisman, before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air. \" — John Quincy Adams \" Courage is being scared to death - but saddling up anyway. \" — John Wayne \" Above all things, never be afraid. The enemy who forces you to retreat is himself afraid of you at that very moment. \" — Andre Maurois \" I have never made but one prayer to God, a very short one: 'O Lord, make my enemies ridiculous.' And God granted it. \" — Voltaire \" Safeguarding the rights of others is the most noble and beautiful end of a human being. \" — Kahlil Gibran, ‘’The Voice of the Poet’’ \" He conquers who endures. \" \" It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees! \" — Emiliano Zapata \" You know the real meaning of peace only if you have been through the war. \" — Kosovar \" Those who have long enjoyed such privileges as we enjoy forget in time that men have died to win them. \" — Franklin D.
