Some people think she might harbor some ill-will toward her stepmother, all because of the look she was giving her at a March 8 International Women's Day event.\nMelania hosted a women's luncheon for the special day in the State Dining Room, for her first time as First Lady, notes the Daily Mail. Though press members were sent away before she gave a speech, they caught the beginning of the event, in which Melania, clad in a black dress, entered the room to a standing ovation. Ivanka stood in the background and joined in the applause:\n\nSome people noticed the look that Ivanka was giving Melania and questioned what the first daughter really thinks of her.\n\"The look [Ivanka] 'Daughter lady' gives to her step mother 'First lady' while she was walking says volumes!!\" wrote one Daily Mail reader. \nAnother said that Ivanka's face while clapping \"looks like she is not happy sharing the limelight with Melania. Why the long look, I read that sales of your merchandise are doing well.\"\n\"I would like to see more of her in [the White House] and WITHOUT Ivanka always hovering about...let [Melania] be her own person \" wrote another reader, while another chimed in with a similar sentiment, asking, \"Why is Ivanka stuck in everything?\"\nSomebody else questioned whether Melania was \"not genuine\" and suggested that the first lady might be \"just there for the photo ops.\"\nNot everyone believed that there was something wrong with the photo. Some readers thought that people were making something out of nothing and just looking to stir the pot.\n\"It should be a nice article nice comment logic... but you know,\" commented one person. \"You could never [please] everybody. Somehow somewhere somebody's butt hurt just sayin....\"\nAnother said that the critics were just jealous of Melania's looks, while another praised the first lady, calling her \"a very beautiful, smart and classy lady.\"\n\"Sheer class!\" someone wrote. \"No flash jewellery or status display... just her personality. A First Lady indeed!\"\nWhatever the dynamic truly is between the two, Ivanka has spoken fondly of her stepmother before, calling her a wonderful mother to 10-year-old Barron amid the busy and contentious campaign season and saying that she would make a \"very powerful and impactful first woman\" in a July 2016 interview with People.\n\"Melania is very smart, she's very warm, sheâ€™s got an incredible heart,\" Ivanka said at the time. \"She's always been very charitable and there are many organizations that she's worked with. Not just for a season but over the course of many years and decades in some cases.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:53:16.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
