He even has to study at the weekends, sometimes. \nYet he does not complain and feels proud of his academic achievements, according to his father. \n\"Sometimes the boy envies other children's slow pace of learning, but he also enjoys his studies and his life,\" he said. \n\"You cannot protect your children forever. You should make them compete and push them to progress, like how eagles train their offspring.\" \nHowever, Wang Liping, an education expert and former principal of the Nanjing Zhongshan Elementary School, warned against the negative effects of such strict teaching methods. \n\"Parents have the freedom to educate their children the way they believe is best, but a child's growth has certain patterns and rules,\" Wang said. \n\"It's against their nature to be educated too harshly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:21:03.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
