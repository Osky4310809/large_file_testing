A major scientific discovery was announced on Wednesday that involves 1) the possibility of life on other planets besides Earth and 2) keeping an open mind.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nNASA has discovered seven entire Earth-sized exoplanets (they’re called that because they’re not in our solar system) orbiting a dwarf star with an ill name: TRAPPIST-1 . What’s more, this exoplanet system is pretty close, only roughly 40 light-years away from Earth. \nIt might surprise you to learn I’m not a scientist, so here’s an explanation via NASA’s press release:\nAdvertisement \n\nNASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope has revealed the first known system of seven Earth-size planets around a single star . Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water.\nThe discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water—key to life as we know it—under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.\nThink about it...\n\nAgain, I’m not a scientist, but I know science and I think this reestablishes the fact that aliens are real***. It won’t be long before they arrive.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:39:54.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
