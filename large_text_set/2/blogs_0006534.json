BREAKING: US appeals court refuses to reinstate Trump's ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n— The Associated Press (@AP) February 9, 2017 \nThe people of the seven countries Trump originally restricted from entering the United States for 90 days include the people of Iran, Yemen, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Somalia and Iraq. \nThe enforcement of the controversial executive order now remains on hold. \nAccording to NBC News, the court ruled against reinstating the ban due to the fact the Justice Department failed to demonstrate how keeping the ban on hold would inflict “irreparable injury.” \nShortly after the news broke, President Trump immediately jumped on Twitter to address the matter, obnoxiously tweeting, \nSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! \nThat’s exactly what I jokingly suggested he’d say. Here’s President Trump’s tweet following the unanimous decision not to reinstate his controversial Muslim ban. SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 \nJudging by the excessive and unnecessary capitalization, I’m just going to go ahead and guess he is LIVID. \nAfter his surprisingly brief Twitter rant, the 70-year-old real estate mogul and reality TV star spoke to reporters about the court’s ruling, saying, \nIt’s a political decision, and we’re going to see them in court. This is just a decision that came down, but we’re going to win the case. \nTrump seems awfully determined to continue “temporarily” violating the rights of nearly 213 million people. However, thanks to the three-judge federal appeals court panel, the ban sits on ice. Giphy \nNBC’s report states the panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a statement on the decision, which reads, \nFederal courts routinely review the constitutionality of — and even invalidate — actions taken by the executive to promote national security, and have done so even in times of conflict. \nAside from teaching Americans exactly how complex the inner workings of government structure actually is, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson believes the court’s decision also demonstrates President Trump is nowhere near above the law. \nBottom line, this is a complete victory for the state of Washington. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision, effectively granted everything we sought. We are a nation of laws. \nSo, where do we go from here? REUTERS \nWell, apparently, Trump wants to take the legal battle back to the courtroom, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) has a better idea. \nIn a statement regarding Trump’s so-called “travel ban,” Schumer said, \nPresident Trump ought to see the handwriting on the wall that his executive order is unconstitutional. He should abandon this proposal, roll up his sleeves and come up with a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe. \nHere’s Schumer’s tweet. Pres Trump ought to see the writing on the wall, abandon proposal, roll up his sleeves & come up w/ a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe. \n— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) February 9, 2017 \nI can just imagine Trump’s 140-character, fully capitalized response to that.
