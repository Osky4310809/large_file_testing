Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTottenham have revealed striker Harry Kane suffered ligament damage during Sunday's FA Cup win over Millwall. \nKane, who has scored 24 goals for Spurs this season, limped off in the fifth minute after rolling his right ankle in a challenge with defender Jake Cooper. \nThe swelling reduced enough for Kane to have a scan on Tuesday, which revealed ligament damage. The club said the injury was similar to the one he picked up in September 2016, although not as severe. \nThat injury ruled him out for just under two months, during which time he missed 12 matches. \nA club statement read: \"We can confirm that Harry Kane sustained ligament damage to his right ankle during Sunday's FA Cup win against Millwall. \n\"The injury is similar to the one suffered by the forward against Sunderland in September last year, however it is not considered to be as severe. \n\"Harry will continue to be assessed by our medical staff while he undergoes his rehabilitation at our training centre.\" \nKane, meanwhile, tweeted: \"Always come back stronger from injuries and will be working hard with the medical staff to do that again.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T23:06:35.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
