That is where we will see. \n“I would actually love to see Virat Kohli, if he is given out, he looks at the Indian dressing room, gets some sort of feedback from them — yes or no, I don’t know what signal they decide upon — and then let’s see what the match referee and the ICC decides then.” \nLive stream India v Australia Test Series LIVE on FOX SPORTS.

March 7th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Cricket/Australian Internationals/ Smith looks up, Kohli blows up \nThe Indian team and its management remain furious at the inaction by the ICC over Smith’s indiscretion — for which he apologised post-match and admitted was a “brain fade”. \nBut that acceptance of guilt is unsatisfactory in the eyes of Gavaskar, who described the actions of the ICC and match referee Chris Broad as an affront to the BCCI, Kohli and the Indian team. \n“You and I know exactly what the match referee should have done and it appears that he hasn’t,” Gavakar said. \n“He hasn’t seen that there is anything done that was in breach of the ICC code of conduct. \n“So you and I can rave and rant and do whatever we have to do about it, but the match referee says nothing’s the matter — or at least that’s what the ICC statement suggests. \n“You can say it’s wrong, it’s not correct, it’s a snub to the BCCI and Virat Kohli and the Indian team, but basically that is that.” media_camera Sunil Gavaskar and Allan Border with the trophy that bears their name \nFormer Indian opening batsman Aakash Chopra described the whole situation as “a complete miscarriage of justice”. \n“Personally, in my humble opinion, this should have been reprimanded,” he said. \n“There must have been some ramifications because what we saw was caught on tape. \n“(Australia) did abuse the rule and they got (away) scot-free which is slightly disappointing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:19:50.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
