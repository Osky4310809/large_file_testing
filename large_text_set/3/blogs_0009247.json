An early summer pursuit of Jamie Vardy failed when the England man decided to stay at Leicester, while links to Alvaro Morata and Alexandre Lacazette failed to go beyond the realms of paper talk. The Gunners still needed a forward though, with Danny Welbeck sidelined and Olivier Giroud returning late from the European Championship. \nPerez had been on the brink of a move to Everton, but when Arsene Wenger came calling in late August, London trumped Merseyside. His age and experience made him an interesting signing. At 28, he had been around the block, and his list of clubs (Atletico Madrid, Rayo, Karpaty Lviv, PAOK) showed he was willing to travel and learn, not simply a local boy unable to get beyond playing for his hometown club. \nHe arrived on the back of a good season in La Liga where he scored 17 goals in 36 games and, while he was never going to be the huge upgrade Arsenal fans had been seeking in the striking positions, he showed plenty of early promise. \nHe scored two goals in his third game, an EFL Cup win over Nottingham Forest, and by early December he'd backed that up with a Champions League hat trick and a handful of assists. However, it hasn't been enough to force him into Wenger's reckoning on a more regular basis, and certainly not for what would be considered the meat and drink of the season -- the Premier League. He has made just two starts and nine substitute appearances from the 26 league games played so far. \nThe fact that the first game he started was on Sept. 10 and the next wasn't until Jan. 1 tells a story. Even taking into account an unfortunate injury absence, it speaks to a lack of faith on Wenger's part. Little-used Lucas Perez has just two starts in Arsenal's 26 league games played. \nThere have been times this season when Arsenal have not played well, but generally speaking the issues that have hampered them haven't been up front. Alexis Sanchez has 21 goals, Theo Walcott 17, Olivier Giroud 12 and Perez himself has seven to his name. In all competitions the Gunners have scored 95 goals, so it's not really goal scoring that's the problem, thus making it more difficult for the Spaniard to be considered a solution to any particular problem. \nHowever, it's still difficult to reconcile his performances with the lack of playing time. If Wenger had reservations about him, the way he played, contributed and provided end product must have gone some way to dispelling those. \nPerez also possesses qualities that some of the others don't. His movement is particularly good around the box, he has those years of experience under his belt, and he seems to fit with whomever he plays with. Unlike some who only really seem to click with particular partners, Perez can slot into the side and link up equally well with Ozil, Giroud, Alexis and whoever else is around him. \nIt's little wonder that there have been stories about how unhappy he is. Going from star man at Deportivo to bit-part player at Arsenal must be difficult to take. And while he surely wasn't expecting to make the striker's position his own, he must have been confident about playing more than he has so far. \nAt Â£17m he wasn't hugely expensive, but that's still quite a lot to pay for a stop-gap solution. What happens at the end of the season remains to be seen, and injuries and suspensions could yet open the door for him between now and May, but until now it's been a disappointing season for both the player and for fans who would like to see a bit more of him. \nAndrew Mangan is one of ESPN FC's Arsenal bloggers.
