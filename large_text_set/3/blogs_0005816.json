File Photo \nMANILA, Philippines — The Philippine peso sank to its lowest level in a decade as it continues to be weighed down by expectations of a rate increase by the US Federal Reserve and a cloud of political uncertainty surrounding the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. \nThe peso closed at P50.400 to $1, lower than Thursday’s close at P50.310, according to the Philippine Dealing System. \nIts closing level was the lowest during the day while its intraday high was at P50.315. \nThe Philippine peso remains the weakest among several Asian currencies which have strengthened against the greenback this year. \nAnalysts say that gyrations in the exchange rate are due to the expectation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. \nAccording to the median estimate in Bloomberg surveys of analysts, the peso could depreciate to P50.60. Bloomberg said that the Bank of Philippine Islands estimated that the peso could slide to P52.50 this year.

However, this would take a while, he said.
