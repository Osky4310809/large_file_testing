It's not serious at all. Jennifer is just dating. It's said she's dating the former baseball star (Photo: Getty Images North America) \n\"Jennifer and Alex are both not looking for a relationship, just a good light-hearted time. They are on the exact same page.\" \nNews of the relationship comes after Jennifer insisted she doesn't only date younger men, following her on/off romance with Drake, 30, earlier this year. J-Lo has dismissed suggestions she likes younger men (Photo: Getty Images North America) \nShe explained: \"First of all, stop! I don't date younger men. I don't think men have to be younger. It's not about that. I just meet people, and if I go out with them, I go out with them. And if I like them, I like them, and if I don't, I don't. It's about the person, you know what I mean? It's about who they are. It has nothing to do with age! \n\"There's this thing, because I dated Beau [her backing dancer Casper Smart], and he was younger, and he was the first guy I ever dated who was younger than me, but then I got labelled right away. For me, it isn't [about age].\" \nJennifer has nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex-husband Marc Anthony.
