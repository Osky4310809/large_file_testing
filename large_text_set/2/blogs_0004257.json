Could be a weird coincidence. Could be just a stupid mistake of some kind. What’s clear is that two New York City men are in the hospital after one of them violently subdued a masked robber who turned out to be his own nephew. \nAccording to WPIX , a 57-year-old occupant of a house in Jamaica, Queens, was expecting the delivery of a package last Friday morning and responded to a knock on the door. He did find someone outside holding a box, but that individual was wearing a mask and forced his way into the house in an attempted robbery. \nThe occupant, who has not been identified in news reports, fended off the assailant with a machete in a battle that left the attacker in critical condition and the defender in serious condition, KTVI reported. When the attacker’s mask was removed, he was revealed as the occupant’s 25-year-old nephew, Kevin Henriksen. It was, in fact, Henriksen’s birthday.
