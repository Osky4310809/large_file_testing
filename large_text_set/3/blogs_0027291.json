I was horrified thinking, 'where could he have gotten this?'\" Jackson said, recalling when she picked up Hunter from the preschool in Troy, IL, Tuesday. \nHunter's parents got a letter from the school's director saying Hunter had been suspended for 7 days. The letter says they'd repeatedly been reminded about Hunter using other toys as make-believe guns, in violation of school policy including Monday, when Jackson picked Hunter up from the preschool, the day before the shell casing incident. \nThe school's vice-president told Fox 2 the suspension was for more than the shell casing; that the school was simply following its discipline policy. He said he couldn't go into further detail, citing confidentiality concerns. \n\"He's cried about it and he doesn't understand why his school hates him,\" Jackson said of her son. \nHer Facebook post about it being shared across the country. \nIt turns out the casing came from a visit with Hunter's grandpa who is a Caseyville police officer, Jackson said. \nHe's made it a point to teach Hunter about hunting and responsible gun use at a young age. \n\"[Hunter] just was wandering around in a field and picked up and put it in his pocket and didn't tell his parents...it's paranoia. It's something that's become quite an epidemic where guns are automatically assumed that they're bad...and I'm not sure how a 7-day suspension teaches my son anything about tolerance or anything about why he was wrong. It just means his school doesn't want him there because of things he enjoys,\" Jackson said. \nThe school's vice-president e-mailed her that he was notifying the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). He confirmed that to Fox 2 but said since A Place 2 Grow was licensed by DCFS, DCFS needed to be notified. \nJackson said she was not sure if Hunter will return after the suspension.
