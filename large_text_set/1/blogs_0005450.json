This week, The Sun and the Moon , a very hot story by @lesliemcadam . I arrived at Southwinds, saw his gorgeousness behind the counter, and ordered my latte \"for here,\" and he grinned and gave me a sexy chin lift.

I realized that I had been sitting in Southwinds for a long time and I should be getting home. I had lost track of time and of where Ryan was. He wasn't at the cash register. I gathered my purse and wandered down to the bathroom, which was in the very back of the shop, carrying the coffee shop key, attached, with dignity, to a large serving spoon. When I emerged, Ryan was coming down the hall. Before I could do anything, he suddenly walked into my space and grabbed the back of my head with one hand, my tail bone with the other, and pressed me up against the wall, his mouth one inch from mine. My breasts crashed against his hard, broad chest, and I got an up close and personal view of his \"Ryan\" nametag on his apron. Oh, and that sexy surfer face. So of course this happened too fast for me to process. In my daze, I noticed a combination of protectiveness and power from him. He shielded my head and ass from getting hurt, but he was still in control — and still slamming me up against the wall. I dropped the serving spoon with a clatter. \"You with him?\" he asked, huskily. God, he smelled clean and good. I was amused that he was jealous of Jake. Jake was good-looking, sure, but his personality kept me from being attracted to him in any way other than as a distant observer. It was nothing like the seductive pull I felt toward Ryan. It was easy to answer Ryan honestly. \"No. He's just a coworker.\" I responded in a quiet voice, an inch away from his mouth, looking into his eyes. \"Anyone else?\" he asked, roughly. \"No.\" I whispered. \"Then you're with me.\" And he closed the gap between us instantly, his warm mouth kissing mine, all of his body pressed against mine. I lost myself in his kiss, in his body, and dropped my purse to the ground, grabbing his tight ass and pressing him into me with both hands.

Our tongues fought for position, our hands wild all over each other's bodies, and he broke away with a growl, staring at me. \"No control. I have no control with you.\" \"Me neither,\" I said. This was apparently the right thing to say, because he grabbed my hand, bent down to pick up my purse, and hauled me into an adjacent storage room and shut the door, locking it. There was a small window with frosted glass, allowing in ambient light. He didn't turn on the fluorescent light overhead. The room was stocked with boxes of paper cups, lids, and paper towels, huge burlap bags of coffee, and industrial cleaning supplies. It was infused with the heavenly scent of coffee all around us. In an instant, his mouth was back on mine and it was the best place for it to be. I nipped at his lips, chased his tongue, and grabbed every part of him I could. I got to touch his hair. I repeat, I got to touch his hair. It was unbelievably soft, thick blond curls with golden glints. Without any control, I started untying his black Southwinds apron and he ducked to take it off. I yanked his shirt out from his pants, wanting, needing to feel those abs that I have dreamt about. Righteous. His bare skin was smooth, warm, and soft, and the muscles under his soft skin nearly made me come undone. I reached around and hugged his lower back, feeling the dimples from the muscles there as he kissed my throat, sucking and licking his way down my neck. I moaned like I was faking it but I was not. His hands made the journey from my jaw to my back to my ass. Then, in an instant, he looked at me questioningly and I understood immediately. After a week of new experiences with vibrators, Brazilians, naughty books, a burrito kiss, and his boner behind the counter, no, I couldn't wait either. I gave him the go ahead. \"Yes,\" I whispered, and he yanked up my skirt, pulled down my panties, and I stepped out of them. Then he slid one hand on my ass, the other hand between my legs, and then growled at what I was sure was nothing but wetness. By the way, I have never had a man growl at me before and I heartily recommend it. I nearly convulsed on the spot... Click here to continue reading The Sun and the Moon .
