Claws â€” OptaJose (@OptaJose) March 4, 2017 \nMadrid took the lead after 14 minutes when Asensio - in as one of Zidane's eight changes - had exchanged passes with James and sent in a low cross from the left. \nBenzema's initial shot from a tight angle was parried by Yoel, but the striker kept his cool and found the bottom corner with a left-footed strike on the rebound. \nThe forward netted again in the 25th minute after being left completely unmarked to convert James' in-swinging free-kick from inside the six-yard box. \nBenzema then turned provider as Madrid struck again four minutes later, collecting a pass from Luka Modric before seeing his right-wing cross impressively converted by a sliding James, who directed his finish into the top corner. \nYoel got down well to keep out efforts from Benzema and Asensio as the visitors went into half-time in complete control. \nKeylor Navas had still not been troubled by the time Madrid scored their fourth after an hour and Benzema was involved again with his chip sending Asensio racing towards goal. \nHe then squared for James, whose curling effort bounced of the post before Asensio reached the rebound and produced an impressive left-footed finish from a difficult angle. \nWith the result beyond doubt, Benzema was given a break for the closing stages, Mariano given a rare chance to impress. \nEibar had a goal ruled out for offside as they attempted to respond, Gonzalo Escalante flagged for offside having tapped in after Navas had kept out Sergi Enrich's header from point-blank range. \nBut the hosts got a goal that did count with 18 minutes remaining, a cross from ex-Madrid winger Pedro Leon - who the visitors claimed had fouled Nacho in the build-up - turned in by Pena at the far post. \nAny hopes Eibar had of a positive result had long been extinguished, though, as Madrid put the pressure back on Barca and turned their attention to Tuesday's crucial Champions League last-16 second-round match with Napoli, which they lead 3-1. 1 - Eibar have scored in La Liga against Real Madrid at Ipurua for the first time ever.
