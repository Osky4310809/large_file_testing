By Jason Mackey / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nDETROIT – Kris Letang could be back Monday. Or he could miss a month. Maybe more. \nPenguins coach Mike Sullivan didn’t have an update on the status of Letang, who appeared to hurt his left knee at 3:21 of the first period Saturday, took one more shift then called it a night. \nWhat’s much more clear is that Letang’s teammates are concerned for his well-being. \n“He’s such an important player for us,” Matt Cullen said. “Obviously it’s a big concern. He does so many things for us. He’s one of our very most important players.You hope he’s OK.” \nAfter getting mixed up with Detroit’s Thomas Vanek in the corner, Letang left the Penguins’ 6-3 loss at Joe Louis Arena, hardly able to put any weight on his left leg and grabbing at that knee. \nHe returned less than 10 minutes later, attempting to test the leg during a TV timeout and maneuvering gingerly around the bench before taking one final shift. \nIt came at 12:30 and lasted just 17 seconds. At one point Letang, who played 2:06, was gliding on his right skate with his left in the air. \n“Anytime someone doesn’t finish a game, there’s certainly concern,” Ian Cole said. “I don’t know the extent of his injury. I don’t know what happened. If he couldn’t finish, it’s a problem. Hopefully we’ll have him back soon.” \nLetang could be seen walking out of the Penguins dressing room. He had somewhat of a limp, although it did not appear to be terribly severe. \nThe Penguins have a scheduled day off Sunday, which means that any update to Letang’s status won’t be obtained until after Monday’s morning skate. \nBut with Letang suffering at least his third injury of the season – he’s missed seven games with a lower-body injury and five with an upper-body injury – his teammates were certainly hoping for good injury news when the Penguins got back to Pittsburgh and more was learned. \n“There’s obviously concern,” Justin Schultz said. “He’s one of our best players. Hopefully he’s alright and can get back soon.” \nYou need not look any further than the goal Letang scored 27 seconds into this one – from a distance, perfectly placed high blocker side – for what he adds to this team. \nIf he’s out for any extended stretch, the Penguins will have to cover a boatload of minutes, usually around 26-28 a night, plus special teams duties. \nIt’s not easy. \n“He’s a hard guy to replace,” Sullivan said. “He’s our top defenseman. We’ve done it before. He’s been out before. We’ve got capable people. It won’t be any one guy. It will be by committee. But let’s not get of ourselves. We’ll see how he is.” \nJason Mackey: jmackey@post-gazette.com and Twitter @JMackeyPG.
