(Petar Valkov/CBC) \nWith Saturday's high of 11.6 C, ​Toronto just crushed a February high temperature record set back in 2011. \nThe previous record-setting temperature for Feb. 18 was 10.8 C at Pearson International Airport. \nTrudy Kidd, a meterologist with Environment Canada, says that warm air coming from the southern U.S. is causing these extra-high temperatures. With Saturday's high of 11.6 C, ​Toronto just crushed a February high temperature record set back in 2011.
