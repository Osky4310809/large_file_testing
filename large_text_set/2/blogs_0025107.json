Now, it's trying to put some of that money towards helping everyday Americans who are fighting Trump policies on the ground.\nThe organisation has launched PeoplePower.org, a website where individuals can find \"digital tools\" to protest and take part in the grassroots efforts to stand up for Americans' rights and make sure the current presidency doesn't step on those rights.\nSEE ALSO: Moving ACLU video tells the story of a trans teen who could make history\n“The ACLU will continue to challenge President Trump’s unconstitutional actions in court and with PeoplePower.org , we will take that fight to the streets,” Anthony D. Romero, the ACLU's executive director, said in a statement.\nTo kick off this fight for rights \"in the streets,\" the ACLU will host a \"resistance training\" townhall in Miami, Florida on March 11. It's also calling its members nationwide to organize local demonstrations through an email that went out on Friday.\nImage: courtesy of peoplepower.org\nThis marks something of a departure from the organization's previous efforts to protect civil rights, in which it's played more of a formal, legal role. Attorneys with the ACLU have been behind a number of legal cases advocating the rights of Americans in Trump's America, such as lawsuits filed against Trump for his immigration ban that was ultimately struck down by a federal appeals court.\n“We are in the fight of our lives right now, and what we have learned since Donald Trump’s inauguration is that there is a growing army of people out there who want to be asked to do something big and important in response,\" Romero said in a statement.\nThe new effort brings together a number of activist groups, \"experienced digital organizers\" who have worked at the White House and the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign.\nBONUS: Kick off and sail the skies with this personal aircraft", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jhxJeRTvcNjuh3rRe-5sAhYAOjc=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F394920%2F4f60aaac-8076-49a4-9685-78d880325dd3.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/U8ikQXZ1.jpg", "https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-launches-grassroots-mobilization-platform", "https://go.peoplepower.org/signup/join?source=root", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/U8ikQXZ1.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NBgSYVb_p60HJJAuw05KC39buzQ=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F394920%2F4f60aaac-8076-49a4-9685-78d880325dd3.png"], "published": "2017-02-25T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:20:16.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
