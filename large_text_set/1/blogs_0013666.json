Cole released his fourth studio album 4 Your Eyez Only , which came with little-to-no warning. Last week, it officially went gold, clocking in more than 100,000 sales. Now, seemingly in celebration, Cole has surprise-dropped a new track titled “High for Hours.” Listen to it below via SoundCloud.\n\nAnd in case you thought the title was a euphemism, it’s not. “This is Cole being high as shit,” he utters in the track’s opening seconds before confirming that (you guessed it) he’s been high for hours. Sonically it’s much in the same vein as all the songs on 4 Your Eyez Only , and it would be fair to assume it was cut around the same time.\nRevisit the music videos for the two singles that preceded Cole’s new album, “False Prophets” and “Everybody Dies,” below.\n\n\nIn other music news, SZA has dropped a new single titled “Drew Barrymore” along with the long-awaited announcement of a new album. Listen to the track and get the scoop right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T11:10:00.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
