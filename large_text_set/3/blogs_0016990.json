Rhodes Arena. \nHe was right. For about a half. \nWith Jackson (26-2) holding a 26-20 halftime lead, St. John’s (25-3) scored the first points of the second half. Jackson then took control, going on a 20-4 run that carried into the fourth quarter and propelled the Polar Bears to the regional title. \n“We knew that if we played harder than them for 16 minutes, we were going to win the game,” Kyle Nicolas said. “We just had to keep the intensity up and keep the momentum on our side.” \nNicolas scored 17 points and played a big part in the run, hitting a 3-pointer that gave Jackson a 35-24 lead. His shot followed a Kyle Young dunk that got the mostly pro-Jackson crowd fired up. An offensive foul on the next St. John’s possession had the crowd completely in an uproar. \n“That’s exactly what we needed,” Young said. “We got this place into a frenzy. They all got super loud and gave our team some more hope and we just kept it going.” \nThe defensive intensity for the Polar Bears kept St. John’s at bay, allowing just four points in the third quarter and never allowing an easy offensive possession. \n“We have to defend for 32 minutes and we did that tonight,” Debevec said. “In a regional final to hold a team that has won 22 games in a row (to 38 points) I am so proud.” \nThe final points of the run came on another rim-rattling dunk from Young, who tied for the team lead with 17 points. He went baseline without the ball, received a pass from Logan Hill and then went up with a double pump two-handed dunk that once again energized the crowd. \n“When I was going baseline and Logan tossed that to me, I knew I wanted to go up with it but I didn’t know exactly what I was going to do,” Young said. “After it, I just came down and had a straight face on. I didn’t want to show too much emotion but I was pumped.” \nThe last time Jackson trailed was 10-9 with 3:48 left in the first quarter. The Polar Bears used another run, this time an 11-0 one, to take a 20-10 advantage. It started with a Young basket and ended with a Young 3-pointer, with two 3-pointers by Ethan Stanislawki sandwiched in between. \nJackson won despite a quiet night from Hill, a University of Toledo commit who had six points and two rebounds. \n“He just wants to win, he doesn’t care about stats,” Debevec said. “That’s who we are. That’s why we are winning because these guys love each other. We are all community of Jackson kids who care for each other.” \nThere were times on Saturday night where if you closed your eyes, you would have thought the game was being played at Jackson High School, not 17 miles away at The University of Akron. \n“It felt awesome, we have the best fans in the state,” Nicolas said. “It felt like a home game tonight with all of these fans here. It was just awesome.” \nJackson will travel to Columbus to play St. Edward in the state semifinals on Friday, March 24 at 8:30 p.m. at the Schottenstein Center. The last time Jackson advanced to Columbus was in 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T04:21:31.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
