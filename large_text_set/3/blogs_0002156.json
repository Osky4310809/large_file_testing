For those who couldn’t join live, you can watch the recording here: \nCEO John Riccitiello was joined on stage by CTO Joachim Ante, Technical Director Lucas Meijer, Founder David Helgason, along with other Unity Technologies staff, and some of our esteemed partners to celebrate a few milestones, reflect on the Unity 5 lifecycle, and share our vision for 2017 and beyond. \n2016 was a pivotal year and after hard work we’re releasing more stable builds — a 38% drop in support tickets shows we’re making great progress. We’re more committed than ever to our pledge of improving the quality and stability of Unity and we can’t wait for you to see what we have in store for 2017. Unity 5.6 \nUnity 5 came to life two years ago at GDC 2015. It’s been an incredible era, with so many remarkable Made with Unity games and experiences created in that time from creators such as Firewatch, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, Lara Croft Go, Job Simulator, Assassin’s Creed Identity, and Super Mario Run. Today we announced that 5.6, the final installment of Unity 5, will be released on March 31. \nHere’s a brief rundown of the key 5.6 features talked about in the keynote: \nProgressive Lightmapper: Gives you immediate feedback when trying out different lighting scenarios, with selective baking, super fast iteration, and debugging. \nVulkan: ARM, Infinite Dream & Unity built a demo with SkyForce Reloaded to demonstrate how how Vulkan maximizes performance and reduces battery usage. \nTo learn how to get the most from Vulkan in Unity, be sure to attend the GDC session presented by ARM on Thursday, 10AM – Room 3022 West Hall. \nMetal: Apple Metal graphics API gives you access to the raw power of the chipsets on your devices. Now, available directly in the editor on MacOS, you can view scenes in editor as it will appear when you deploy on a device. Unity 5.5 added instancing, the ability to write native Metal shaders — 5.6 brings Metal Compute. Developer nWay got on stage with their upcoming game Power Rangers: Legacy Wars to show off the full potential of Metal. Thank you to surprise special guests Ludi Lin and Jason David Frank of Power Rangers fame for joining us on stage! \n2D Tools : Unity 5.6 is adding CompositeCollider2D, an outline editor, 2D physics contacts API and more. \nNew NavMesh tools: improving AI and Pathfinding to more easily control character navigation through giant game worlds. \nUnity Collaborate Beta: A simple way for teams to save, share, and sync their Unity project — all Cloud hosted! Unity Collaborate has entered open beta so be sure to sign up now! \nPerformance Reporting: Unity Performance Reporting automatically collects errors across various devices and platforms making it easier for you to find and fix issues in real time. New in Unity 5.6, it will capture and report native crashes recorded for iOS games. \nTextMesh Pro: We’re happy to announce that one of the top performing tools on the Unity Asset Store, used to deliver substantial visual quality to text styling and texturing in games via advanced text rendering, will now be available for free to users of 5.3+ and natively integrated into Unity in the future. \nVisit the Unity Asset Store to get TextMesh Pro now . \nVR platforms: 5.6 will ship with Google Daydream and Cardboard which ncludes Android and iOS. Platforms \nBecause your success is our success, we’re grateful to work with wonderful partners like Facebook and Xiaomi to bring you new opportunities to seek global distribution and discovery. \nAs one of the top handset manufacturers and Android app stores in China, Xiaomi is now offering Western developers direct access to the Chinese market. Unity developers with global vision can learn more here . \nIn 5.6 Unity developers will be able to choose Facebook as a build target and enjoy Facebook payment support for Unity IAP. We’re also pleased that Facebook today announced premium content support for Gameroom, opening the doors for a wider variety of games to join the PC gaming platform’s growing portfolio, and giving developers more opportunities to access Facebook’s 1.8 billion users. VR \nSince the launch of the alpha version of Editor VR in December, it has been downloaded more than 6,000 times. We’re so pleased to see all the useful and amazing tools the global community has been creating. We have been so inspired that we are holding a contest for the best EditorVR tool. There’s a cash prize and the winner will be chosen and showcased at Vision Summit 2017 . We’ll have a few more details for you soon. \nThe Unity Labs team is also working with partners like Oculus, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR, and Daydream to bring you the XR Foundation Toolkit, a framework for XR developers and artists to get up-to-speed as quickly as possible creating immersive experiences.
