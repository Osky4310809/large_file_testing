The peso currency has weakened on concerns he will hurt Latin America’s No. 2 economy. \nREAD MORE: Trump’s new immigration plan could send all illegals to Mexico, regardless of nationality \nPena Nieto had faced criticism he was too accommodating with Trump but got a much needed ratings boost after cancelling the summit. A plan to deport third-country nationals to Mexico fueled outrage this week. \nMexican officials were publicly blunt with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security John Kelly over Trump’s immigration and trade proposals in a visit to Mexico on Thursday. \nOsorio Chong told local radio that Mexican officials’ rejection of Trump’s bid to send non-Mexican illegal migrants from the United States to Mexico was “very clear.” \nIn this Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017 file photo, a truck drives near the Mexico-US border fence, on the Mexican side, separating the towns of Anapra, Mexico and Sunland Park, New Mexico.

We said that there was…absolutely no way.” \nVidegaray said the trade strategy would replicate a 2009 campaign of retaliatory tariff s that helped Mexico win a dispute with the United States. On Wednesday, the minister mentioned Iowa, Texas and Wisconsin as states that could be targeted in a conversation with lawmakers leaked to two newspapers. \n“This is not our preference,” he said. “Mexico believes in free trade.” No handouts please \nA U.S. executive order on Jan. 25 that mandated the construction of a border wall also require government agencies to report the financial assistance they gave Mexico in the past five years, leading to speculation Trump wants to redirect the aid to pay for its construction. \nOsorio Chong said on Friday that Mexico had no need for such financial aid from the United States, signaling that it would not come close to paying for the estimated $21.6 billion cost of the wall. \nLike in other middle-income emerging economies, many in Mexico consider it humiliating to take aid from wealthy countries. \nA large part of U.S. aid to Mexico comes through the Plan Merida program, under which the U.S. Congress allocated $2.6 billion to security assistance between 2008 and 2016. \nOf that, $1.6 billion had been disbursed by November 2016, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service. \n“When they realize what’s left of Merida, they will understand that it’s not even that significant,” Osorio Chong told local radio. \n“We don’t object to them moving these resources… Mexico now has its own capabilities,” he said. \nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said on Friday it will accept proposals next month for the design of Trump’s wall, a first step in picking vendors. \nVidegaray said a meeting of Tillerson, Kelly and Pena Nieto in Mexico City was a short courtesy visit. \nHe said in a more substantial meeting of the ministers, Kelly told him that deportations of undocumented immigrants from the United States would not be militarized, after Trump characterized the process as a “military operation.” © 2017 Thomson Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T14:31:49.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
