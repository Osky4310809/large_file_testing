(iStockPhoto) Cancel \nYou could be coming into some money soon. According to the Internal Revenue Service, in 2016, 111 million Americans received tax refunds, with the average amount being $2,860. \nOf course, you may not be due anything. The IRS expects 30 percent of taxpayers to not receive refunds this year. But let's say you get a refund. What should you do with it? Throw a party? Save the money? Invest it? \nIf you're looking for ideas, we have them. Now that said, the higher your refund, the easier it is to decide what to do with it. So we're going to assume you're getting something lower than the national average but something high enough to put it to good use – $1,000. \n[See: 9 Red Flags That Could Trigger a Tax Audit .] \nPut the refund into a savings account. The national interest rate for a savings account is pretty low – 0.06 percent APY (annual percentage yield), according the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That means over a year's time, your bank account will have an extra 60 cents in it. But rates are expected to rise, and the point of putting money away isn't only to grow it, but to have it accessible if you need it. \nUse the refund to pay off credit card debt. Reducing debt, especially reducing high-interest revolving credit card debt, is also a way of saving money, points out Luke Orlando, a Houston-based management consultant with a background in finance. \nOrlando says: \"When grappling with decisions like this, the question should always be, 'What is my return?'\" 17 Ways to Reduce Credit Card Debt in 2017 Make this the year you pay off your credit card balances. \nHe explains that if you are bogged down with debt, and you're paying 17 percent in interest payments, assuming your credit card debt is around $1,000, you'll save a lot more if you use the tax refund to end the debt rather than putting it in a bank account and earning, say, a 1 percent annual return. If you have far more than $1,000 in credit card debt and the thousand won't come close to wiping it out, what you should do with the tax refund may be a little more complicated. It's never a bad idea to reduce debt, of course, but if you don't have an emergency fund , Orlando says that it wouldn't be a bad idea to use the thousand to start one. \nPut the refund toward your retirement. A thousand dollars would pad your retirement fund nicely, and it's just enough to get you started, if you haven't begun saving for retirement. \n\"There are so many more low-cost options today than we had a decade ago,\" says Kevin Feldman,   and CEO of Feldman Capital, LLC, an asset management advisory firm in San Francisco. \"If you don't have a particular goal in mind and are just saving long-term for retirement, I would recommend checking out Vanguard's Target Retirement funds, which are easy to open online, have a $1,000 minimum and there are an assortment of choices based on your age.\" \nFeldman adds: \"If you think you'll be doing more investing in the years ahead and want more flexibility, Schwab is also an excellent choice for your first $1,000, which also happens to be the minimum to open an account. Once your account is open, you can buy any of the Schwab exchange-traded funds commission-free.\" \nAnother thing to keep in mind: If you have a 401(k) and an employer that matches funds, you may be able to park the $1,000 in there and double your money. \n  \nUse the refund for car or home maintenance. There are certain tasks every homeowner and car owner should do, and if you ignore them, you may pay dearly. For instance, never cleaning your gutters can lead to water pooling around your home's foundation, and you might wind up with a flooded basement. \nIf paying someone to clean out your gutters seems awfully unsatisfying, what about buying four new tires? Probably also not your idea of a good time, but that's a suggestion from Timothy Wiedman, a retired associate professor of business at Doane University in Crete, Nebraska. \n\"A great many folks push the limits when it comes to replacing their old tires,\" Wiedman says. \nHe estimates that most people could buy a new set of brand name all-season tires for a car or small SUV for about $500. And with the rest of the money? \n\"If maintenance has also been postponed – changing the coolant, replacing a 5-year-old battery, or buying new front brake pads, for example – any of those chores could likely be done at the same time with plenty of money to spare,\" Wiedman says. \nAfter all, going to a mechanic to prevent problems is cheaper than constantly going to your mechanic to fix problems. \n[See: A Checklist for Last-Minute Tax Filing .] \nStart a side business with the refund. This is only smart if you were thinking of doing this anyway. Not everyone is cut out for running a business, and you don't want to sink your money into a venture that goes nowhere. \nBut John Paul Engel, a lecturer of entrepreneurship at the University of Iowa, points out that $1,000 could go toward things like buying a web domain, paying for registering your business, getting business cards and opening a business bank account. \nAnd if you are entrepreneurial, Engel says, \"you can turn that unexpected $1,000 into $10,000 or even $100,000.\" \nInvest the refund – in you. Kenneth Ashe, a project manager at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey, says that if you aren't going to invest the money in the market, try investing in yourself. \n\"A thousand dollars could easily cover an online course, a gym membership and a number of books. Spending this money on self-improvement is an investment that could benefit you for the rest of your life,\" Ashe says. \nDon't forget that \"fun\" is in the word refund. No, don't use your entire refund to throw a party. But some personal finance experts do suggest that if you took 10 percent and did something fun with it, that can be smart. \n\"Splurge with the first $100 – then do something very boring with the $900, [like] stash it in an emergency fund,\" says Howard Dvorkin, CPA and chairman of Debt.com, a debt solutions website. \n\"Think of saving as if it were dieting. If you don't treat yourself to a 'cheat day' every so often, you'll give up on the diet,\" Dvorkin says. \"Well, if you suddenly have $1,000 and act responsibly with all of it, you're likely to cave into emotion later on and overspend on something else.\" 8 Hacks to Ease Your Financial Life Slideshow Upgrade your financial planning. (Getty Images) \nLike the maestros who figure out how to convert a couple of Ikea bookcases into a kitchen island, some financial advisors have secret tools and secret ways to use common tools. Here’s a roundup of eight common hacks experts use for financial planning – and that you can use, too. Estimate the biggest unknown.

Drill down to your likely life expectancy using the calculators at Livingto100.com or BlueZones.com. Use the results to discuss your health with your doctor and your wealth with your financial planner. \"Think of talking with a financial advisor like talking with your doctor. Get a diagnosis and a care plan,\" says Kathleen Hastings, portfolio manager with FBB Capital Partners, based in Bethesda, Maryland. A new “magic number” retirement income (iStockPhoto) \nWhat if you could gain income in retirement by spending strategically? That’s the concept behind Income Discovery, pioneered by information technology executive Manish Malhotra. His model is used by financial consultants affiliated with E*Trade and other firms. Unlike accumulating wealth, which is rife with factors you cannot control, tweaking when and how you tap sources of cash flow is within your control. For example, the structure of accounts, combined with careful timing, can result in additional cash when you withdraw funds in sequence. “By mixing and matching different types of income at different times, you get higher post-tax retirement income,” Malhotra says. Think income stability, not risk tolerance. (iStockphoto) \nThe retirement savings industry is so obsessed with growth that retirees’ deep desire for stable, reliable income is often overlooked, says Chris Browning, assistant professor in the department of personal financial planning at Texas Tech University. Instead of trying to diagnose your tolerance for risk, figure out how dearly you value a stable income in retirement, he suggests. That means your definition of success is less about a bigger portfolio and more about the mix of assets and products that ensure reliable income. Rev up your Roth: Part I (iStockPhoto) \nA Roth isn’t only for retirement, Hastings says. After five years, contributions you have made to your Roth individual retirement account can be withdrawn tax-free without penalty for these additional purposes: up to $10,000 to cover the down payment for a first home purchase, to pay for college and to pay for health care expenses or health insurance if you are unemployed. Rev up your Roth: Part II (iStockPhoto) \nConsider using a Roth IRA to save for your children’s college costs, leveraging the option to withdraw your contributions (not what you’ve earned on those contributions) for tuition, Hastings says. Typically, Roth IRAs are not counted as parental assets on financial aid forms. Or, you could open a Roth IRA for your child, and the child could withdraw the contributions for college, tax-free. But Jared Roskelley, president of Jackson Roskelley Wealth Advisors, cautions parents about setting up a fund for your child in his or her name. \"There's a risk. It's a gift. They can do with it what they want,\" he says. More fun with Roths   a Roth 401(k), even if you don’t think you need one, Roskelley says. The Roth 401(k) has the same contribution limit as the traditional 401(k), which is $18,000. After your Roth 401(k) has been around for five years, an array of options opens up, such as rolling your regular 401(k) into it to diversify the tax status of your retirement savings. Backfill   \nIf you get hit with a big medical bill early in the year, remember that your account doesn’t have to be fully funded the year before you use it for a medical expense. As long as the medical expenses occur in the same year you take the distribution from the health savings account , the account can be funded after the expense occurs, Roskelley says. Of course, you’ll need to check the specifics of your employer’s plan and related IRS limits. Stay at home with one exception. (iStockPhoto) \nParents who decide to step out of their careers to care for children or to address other personal responsibilities can still maintain eligibility for Social Security disability benefits by taking on just a little bit of paid work each year, Roskelley says. This is an easy, inexpensive way to cover the at-home partner with a bit of disability insurance without having to pay for it out of pocket.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:21:01.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
