He and his wife Larra Morris began a podcast last summer in which they talk about the disease, his multiple kidney transplants, and how they’ve had to adjust their lives as a result of all this. Their openness and honesty is undoubtedly refreshing for anyone else dealing with the same problem. \nA recent episode included a conversation about how the two of them — both atheists, though they haven’t talked about it before — deal with friends and family members who say the disease is part of God’s plan or who offer non-scientific solutions to whatever Ari is going through. \nWe often hear these discussions in the aftermath of a death, but people inadvertently using religious language to communicate their sympathy — even when it rubs atheists the wrong way — affects a lot of people going through difficult times. And no one knows what the problem is until you hear atheists talking about it. \nThe relevant portion begins around the 30:00 mark below: \nHere’s hoping some of their religious listeners take a hint. \nBe sure to check out the entire podcast right here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:16:32.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
