By Noel Vasquez/GC Images \nOh, baby! \nE! News can exclusively reveal that Steven Yeun and Joana Pak have named their newborn son Jude Malcolm Yeun . \nToo adorable! As we previously reported, The Walking Dead star's wife gave birth to their first child together on March 17, 2017. \nA little over a week after becoming parents, Joana took to Instagram with the first-ever photo of little Jude napping peacefully on his mama's lap. Steven followed up the day after, expressing gratitude to his fans for their support and well wishes. He captioned a photo of his son's tiny hand, \"thanks. we are well. much much love.\" Photos A post shared by Joana Pak (@jopakka) on Mar 24, 2017 at 4:17pm PDT \nNews of the couple's pregnancy broke last December, only a couple of days after they tied the knot at the Paramour Estate in California in front of friends, family and a few of Yeun's former TWD co-stars, such as Norman Reedus , Andrew Lincoln and Melissa McBride . \nThe couple kept most details of their road to baby under wraps, but shortly before Jude Malcom was welcomed into the world, Steven shared a series of photo booth pics with his leading lady, who sported a massive baby bump . \nWhat an exciting time for this trio! \nWe can't wait to learn more about Jude Malcolm.
