But injuries have once again threatened to torpedo their season. Blake Griffin has missed the past 18 games with a knee injury, and Chris Paul is set to miss at least 6-8 weeks after undergoing surgery to repair a torn ligament in his thumb. Sharpshooter J.J. Redick has also battled hamstring issues in recent weeks. \nGiven their precarious position, it was highly possible that L.A. would plummet all the way to the seventh or eighth seed while they awaited Griffin’s return, or out of the playoff picture entirely. Yet just like last year when their All-Star forward missed a significant stretch of the season, the Clippers have managed to do more than just tread water. They’ve won eight of their last 10 games and currently hold the fourth spot in the Western Conference standings. \nNow, it appears Griffin will make his return against the Sixers in Philadelphia on Tuesday night. \nBlake Griffin listed as probable tonight. Doc said yesterday \"most likely.\" All signs pointing to Blake's return tonight in Philly\n— Rowan Kavner (@RowanKavner) January 24, 2017 \n\nBut will that be enough to salvage any title aspirations they still might harbor? On the one hand, it’s obviously better to battle injuries now, at the midway point of the season, rather than in the playoffs like they did last year when they lost both Griffin and Paul in their opening round match-up against the Blazers. \n\nThe Clippers might also benefit from a somewhat weakened Western Conference field that is currently on pace to see a sub-.500 team (perhaps two) qualify for the postseason. What happens over the next two months during Paul’s absence will be critical. They have a narrow one-game lead on the Jazz for the fourth seed and just a three-and-a-half game cushion over the Thunder. \nOver the next month, they’ll play the Warriors three times, a stretch that will also include games against the Celtics, Raptors, Jazz, and Spurs, and much of their success will depend upon how quickly Griffin will be able to return to form. Griffin has, at various points in his NBA career, been a borderline MVP candidate and arguably one of the league’s best power forwards, but he played just 35 games last year and has already missed a big chunk of this season. \nWithout Paul in the lineup, he and frontcourt mate DeAndre Jordan won’t get nearly as many easy looks as they lean heavily on reserve guards Austin Rivers and Raymond Felton. Right now, the Clippers just need to try and stay in the mix. If they can keep their heads above water until Paul returns, get everyone healthy, and regain some of that early-season chemistry in the stretch run before the playoffs – which is, admittedly, a lot of ifs – they just might give themselves a chance. \nLest we forget that the very future of Lob City in Los Angeles quite literally depends on it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:24:49.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
