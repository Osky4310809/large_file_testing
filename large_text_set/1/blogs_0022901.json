Put simply, he decided to bring his Test-match game to the ODI circuit. \n“I think first and foremost it’s probably been the format I reckon I struggled at early in my career,” Warner said after the second ODI against New Zealand in December. \n“The last 18-24 months I’ve really worked hard on trying to construct my innings and build an innings and not play too many big shots early on. \n“If the ball’s there I’m still going to go after it but I think that’s just what I put it down to, trying to construct an innings and sort of relay that Test match attitude into the one-dayers because you do get a few more balls in your area in one-day stuff where you can play through the line.” \nLEAVING AB, KOHLI IN HIS DUST \nImproving your average by 13 runs in the space of 25 months is no mean feat and it’s taken some seriously special numbers from Warner to get his average from the low 30s to the mid 40s. \nSince the start of 2015 Warner has made 2407 runs at 61.71 across 42 ODI innings. \nThat’s 191 runs more than the second highest run-scorer in this time – Martin Guptill (2216 at 50.36 across 50 innings). \nThe format’s No.2 batsman in the world, de Villiers, has made 1562 runs at 67.91 across 29 innings in this period, and No.3 batsman Kohli has made 1547 at 55.25. \nWarner has also made 11 centuries in this period. That’s five more than the second-placed group of Hashim Amla, de Villiers, Guptill, Kohli and Smith who have each made six. Malik's nasty 'wrist breaker' 1:00 \nCricket: Pakistan's 57 run loss to Australia in their 5th ODI was compounded by a vicious injury to middle order batsman Shoaib Malik in the 31st over.
