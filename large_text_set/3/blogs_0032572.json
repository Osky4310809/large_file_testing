Video capture by Eric Mack/CNET \nRecycling isn't just for cans, bottles and really sucky gifts anymore. \nNearly 15 years after setting out to revolutionize how we get to space, Elon Musk's company SpaceX successfully relaunched an orbital rocket Thursday that had previously been used to push a payload beyond the grasp of Earth's gravity. \nThe Falcon 9 rocket that launched the SES-10 commercial communications satellite from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida is the same rocket SpaceX used to send a Dragon spacecraft on a commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station in April of last year. \nA few minutes after sending the Dragon on its way April 8, the rocket successfully landed on the SpaceX drone ship \"Of Course I Still Love You\" in the Atlantic Ocean.
