It's a much different position to be in for a would-be franchise that was stuck in development hell for a decade, and with Deadpool 2 's nebulous 2018 release date looming, the slow trickle of information is going to start picking up speed. Though most of the movie is still under wraps, here's what we know so far about the next Deadpool . 1. EVEN THOUGH THE UNIVERSE WILL GROW, IT'S STILL A DEADPOOL STORY. \nThe tendency with comic book movie sequels is to keep cramming more characters in until the main hero becomes a supporting role. While Deadpool 2 is set to expand the cast from the first film, writer Rhett Reese is adamant about still making sure it's a Deadpool movie. \n\"Yeah, it’ll be a solo movie,\" Reese told Deadline . \"It’ll be populated with a lot of characters, but it is still Deadpool’s movie, this next one.\" 2. CABLE WILL FINALLY MAKE HIS BIG-SCREEN DEBUT. \nFans have been waiting for Cable to come to theaters ever since the first X-Men movie debuted in 2000, but up until now, the silver-haired time traveler has been a forgotten man. Thankfully, that will change with Deadpool 2 . In the comics, Cable and Deadpool are frequent partners—they even had their own team-up series a few years back—and that dynamic will play out in the sequel. The characters are so intertwined, there were talks of possibly having him in the original. \n\"It’s a world that’s so rich and we always thought Cable should be in the sequel,\" Reese told Deadline . \"There was always debate whether to put him in the original, and it felt like we needed to set up Deadpool and create his world first, and then bring those characters into his world in the next one.\" \nCable is actually the son of X-Men member Cyclops and a clone of Jean Grey named Madelyne Pryor (that's probably the least confusing thing about him, to be honest). While the movie might not deal with all that history, expect Cable to still play a big role in the story. \nOutside of rumors about Pierce Brosnan landing the role, no actor has been confirmed as of yet. 3. THERE'S A NEW DIRECTOR ON BOARD. \nAlthough Deadpool grossed more than $750 million worldwide and was a critical success, it still wasn't enough to keep original director Tim Miller around for the sequel. Miller recently came out and said he left over concerns that the sequel would become too expensive and stylized . Instead, Deadpool 2 will be helmed by John Wick (2014) director David Leitch . Despite the creative shuffling, the sequel will still feature star Ryan Reynolds and writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. \n“He’s just a guy who’s so muscular with his action,\" Reynolds told Entertainment Weekly of Leitch's hiring. \"One of the things that David Leitch does that very few filmmakers can do these days is they can make a movie on an ultra tight minimal budget look like it was shot for 10 to 15 times what it cost,\" 4. ITS WORKING TITLE IS LOVE MACHINE . \nNo, this won't be the title of the movie when it hits theaters, but the working title for Deadpool 2 while it's in production is, appropriately, Love Machine . It's also been revealed that the movie will begin shooting on May 1, 2017. Though there's still no firm release date yet, Fox has reserved March 2, 2018 and June 29, 2018 for the release of two mystery movies. It's possible that a Deadpool sequel could wind up in one of those spots. 5. DON'T EXPECT THE MOVIE TO BE MUCH BIGGER THAN THE ORIGINAL. \nThe natural instinct for any studio is to make the sequel to a hit film even bigger. More money for special effects, more action scenes, more everything. That's not the direction Deadpool 2 is likely heading in, though, despite Miller's fears. As producer Simon Kinberg explained, it's about keeping the unique tone and feel of the original intact. \n\"That’s the biggest mandate going into on the second film: to not make it bigger,\" Kinberg told Entertainment Weekly . \"We have to resist the temptation to make it bigger in scale and scope, which is normally what you do when you have a surprise hit movie.\" More from mental_floss...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:42:49.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
