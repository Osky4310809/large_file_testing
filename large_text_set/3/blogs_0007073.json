'Economic asset' \nProf Martin Cloonan, professor of popular music politics at Glasgow University, said: \"What is being proposed has never been done before and is set to reveal the true state of the UK's live music industry. \n\"Live music is a vital cultural and economic asset and it is important to monitor its health and to support it. \n\"The results will help to provide the clearest picture of the Glasgow live music scene yet, illustrating that vibrancy while also show issues which need to be addressed.\" \nAccording to UK Music, the music industry is worth an estimated Â£3.5bn to the UK economy and creates almost 101,600 jobs. \nThe group said that despite the value of live music to the economy, the full picture of what the public is listening to and how they listen and interact has never been fully and accurately surveyed.

Our hope is that the census will be a vital tool in strengthening a much-loved part of the UK's culture.\" \nThe census aims to cover 70 music events in Glasgow alone. Hundreds more will be covered at the five other cities in England. \nThe survey team will also talk to audiences, venue staff and musicians. \nIts findings will be supplemented by a nationwide online survey for musicians, venues, promoters and audiences that will be open until 8 May.
