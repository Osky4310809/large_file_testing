Peter King says Trump pointed him out and said they grew up near each other. After that, \"it would be hard for me to vote 'no.'\" — Caitlin Huey-Burns (@CHueyBurns) March 21, 2017 \nIn order to get a handful of votes from New York Republicans, House Speaker Paul Ryan \"sweetened\" the Trumpcare bill with a provision that shifts Medicaid costs from counties to state government in New York—and only New York . The move—one of a number of late changes designed to gain more votes—would affect New York State only. It could save county governments outside of New York City $2.3 billion a year. But it could shift costs to state taxpayers or deny New York that same total in matching federal aid if the state continues to require those counties to contribute to the cost of Medicaid. Upstate New York Republicans, backed by local government officials, pressed for the measure over the angry opposition of New York’s Democratic governor, Andrew M. Cuomo. \nOf course it shifts costs to the state taxpayers! The money has to come from somewhere. \nThe House is scheduled to vote on Trumpcare on THURSDAY, MARCH 23. Even if you already called your member of Congress, do it again by calling the Capitol Hill switchboard at (202) 224-3121. Jam the phone lines, and urge them to vote NO. \nRepublican state Sen. John Flanagan, temporary majority leader of the legislature, recognizes that: \"At the end of the day, we're all talking about the same taxpayer.\" \nSo 24 million people will use health insurance. The promise of Medicaid to the nation's elderly and disabled will be broken. His own home state will lose $2.3 billion every year. But Trump noticed him, so Peter King's okay with that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:18:51.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
