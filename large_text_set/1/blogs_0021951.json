At the time, T-Mobile decided to throw a carrot over to AT&T users, offering them a free year of DirecTV Now (kind of) if they switched over to the “Un-carrier”. Today, T-Mobile launched a new promotion for those same customers, while at the same time slamming AT&T over issues with the launch of DirecTV Now.\nSee also: Best T-Mobile prepaid Android phones 1 week ago The new offer will give ex-AT&T customers a free year of Hulu, in addition to the free year of DirecTV Now. T-Mobile’s press release notes many of the media’s reviews of AT&T’s streaming TV service since it launched, with reports of buggy and slow performance from reviewers and many users. John Legere, the always-quotable president and CEO of T-Mobile, stated, “Even I can’t believe AT&T spent $67 billion on DIRECTV and still couldn’t roll out a streaming service that worked!”\nIf you had already switched over from AT&T to T-Mobile to get the free DirecTV Now service, the carrier says it will be sending out a code sometime in the next few weeks that will give you that free year of Hulu as well. Keep in mind that this code is for the “Limited Commercials” tier of Hulu that normally costs $7.99 a month; the version of the service with no ads costs more at $11.99 a month.\nAT&T subscribers who have yet to jump ship to T-Mobile can still get their free year of DirecTV Now, along with the new Hulu promotion. Those customers have to activate two lines of service on the carrier’s T-Mobile ONE plan and then they will get a $35 bill credit each month for a year, which is the equivalent to paying for DirecTV Now’s service every month. More info on this promotion can be found on T-Mobile’s support page .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:12:05.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
