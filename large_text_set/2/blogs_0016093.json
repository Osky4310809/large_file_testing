Remember, you decide what song is going to be next. \nJimi Hendrix \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" \nWriters: Jimi Hendrix Album: Electric Ladyland (1968) (UG Score 9.4) Recorded: May 3, 1968 Genre: Psychedelic rock, Blues rock Length: 5:12 \nRolling Stone's list of 500 greatest songs of all time - # 102 Story behind the song \n\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" is the last song on the last album – Electric Ladyland (UG Score 9.4) – Jimi Hendrix recorded before he died tragically on September 18, 1970, after ingesting too many prescription sleeping pills and too much red wine. It was also the very last song Jimi performed live, just 12 brief days before his death at a girlfriend’s flat in London. Hendrix dedicated the album to his groupies, who he called \"Electric Ladies.\" The original album cover was adorned with naked women, but the ensuing controversy prompted the label (Reprise Records) to swap it out for a photo of Hendrix. The musician wasn't pleased with either version; he wanted to bring in photographer Linda Eastman, who would be more famously known as Linda McCartney, to shoot the cover, but the label nixed the idea. \nThe original song \"Voodoo Child\" is actually a different recording to the one with famous wah-wah effects that you hear covered all the time. And the \"Slight Return\" variant is more common. If you listen to the Electric Ladyland album they're both included. The original is around 15 minutes long, then Jimi gets on with the rest of the album... only to \"return\" (with the more well-known version) at the end of the album. \nHe was all of 27 – a wild, bright light snatched from us in all his power and glory. \"Voodoo Child\" is a song that both celebrates and mourns one of the most influential, awe-inspiring, creative geniuses of our time. It's fitting the swan song of the undisputed champion of the Rock riff is an explosion of raw, slashing guitar prowess – barbed and furious – all flowing through an upside-down, right-handed Fender Stratocaster as if it were plugged directly into the heart of God (or the Devil, depending on who you are). Jimi is the \"Voodoo Child,\" and the song sums up the man – an extraordinary talent who lived a fast, frenzied and sometimes violent life that ended suddenly and tragically. Voodoo, a religion known for its magical ritual and healing capabilities, can be traced back to its tribal roots in Africa – as can Jazz, Blues, Gospel and by way of musical DNA, Rock-N-Roll. Of course, blues masters like Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and B.B. King who had such a strong influence on Jimi were all black, and they created a musical form rooted in the oral tradition of slavery – steeped in sorrow and despair. There’s a reason they call it the Blues, and these guys lived it through merit-less persecution and discrimination. \nThe exact meaning of \"Voodoo Child\" is up for debate, but what makes this song a truly brilliant piece of Rock-N-Roll is the raw passion, abandon, fury and unabashed irreverence with which Jimi performs, both vocally and instrumentally. It’s as if he’s waited a lifetime to get the message off his chest – pumping dark, primordial rage through the strings of his guitar. There’s an artistic vengeance in \"Voodoo Child\" that remains unmatched since his tragic death some 40 years ago. Music Videos \nThere are no official music videos for this song, so here's a fan video with a compilation of significant moments in Jimi's career. Live versions \n\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" became a standard of Hendrix's concert performances and would vary in length from seven to eighteen(!) minutes. \nLive at Woodstock in 1969. \nLive at Stockholm in 1969. Behind the scenes Famous covers \nA variety of musicians has recorded \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return),\" sometimes using the shortened title \"Voodoo Child\". \nJoe Satriani - lead guitar, Teddy \"ZigZag\" Andreadis (Gun 'N Roses, Alice Cooper) -vocals and organ, Bruce Kulick (KISS, Grand Funk Railroad) - guitar, Kane Roberts (Alice Cooper) - guitar, Phil Soussan (Ozzy Osbourne) - bass, and Vinny Appice (Dio, Black Sabbath) - drums. Videotaped by Ken Steinhardt at the Wine, Wisdom, & Rock Experience at The Louis M. Martini Winery, St. Helena, CA, August 17, 2013. \nStevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble's version even was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1985. Gear and settings Guitars \nJimi owned and used a lot of guitars during his career. But the Fender Stratocaster was definitely his guitar of choice and the instrument that became associated with him. He bought his first Strat about 1965 and used them almost exclusively thereafter. \nThe Strat's easy action and relatively narrow neck were ideal to his evolving style and boosted his enormous dexterity - Hendrix's hands were large enough to fret across all six strings with the top joint of his thumb alone, and he could reputedly play lead and rhythm parts together. \nHendrix is known for playing right-handed guitars that were turned upside down and restrung for left-hand playing. This had a significant effect on the sound of his guitar, because of the skew of the bridge pickup, his lowest string had a brighter sound while his highest string had a darker sound, which was the opposite of the Stratocaster's original design. \n1968 Fender Stratocaster Olympic White \nNo guitar expresses a greater convergence of artist, event, and instrument than 1968 Fender Stratocaster played by Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. Taken alone, this guitar is rather usual. Firstly, it was made during CBS's ownership of Fender, the period of lowering quality. It’s a stock right-handed Stratocaster with Olympic White finish. Although the maple fingerboard seems to be integral with the neck, as it was on 1950s Fenders, in reality, it is separate; the giveaway is on the back of the neck, where there is no evidence of the walnut \"skunk stripe\" that is present on all Fender one-piece necks. \nThe string gauges would run .010, .013, .015, .026, .032 and .038. \nThe crucial point is that Jimi used the .015 for the third because the actual sound the .017 for the third in this setup is very G-heavy. \nThis guitar was sold at Sotheby's auction house in London in 1990 for 174,000 pounds and resold in 1993 for 750,000 pounds. \nDespite the fact, that Jimi preferred Strats, if you look throughout Jimi’s career you will see that the used a wide variety of guitars. He’s played Flying Vs, Les Pauls, SGs, Jaguars, and a wide range of acoustics. \nThat’s why you are not obliged to usу only Strats to achieve a Hendrix sound – because Hendrix didn’t limit himself to one type of guitar. You can test different guitars and you shouldn’t feel that only certain guitars will achieve a Hendrix-like tone. Amps and effects \nThe best way to understand the essential components of Jimi's tone is to look at the rig he used in his famous performance at Woodstock in 1969. It’s a very simple rig that gives you a good idea how to achieve the similar sound. \nWhat Hendrix Used", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:24:47.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
