Arkansas hasn’t executed anyone in 12 years and no state has ever executed that many people in such a short period of time. This is a completely reckless decision that will not make anyone safer. We must put pressure on Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to put an end to this disgusting abuse of the criminal justice system.If April’s execution assembly line occurs, they will all take place with new staff, new protocols and a new set of lethal injection drugs, including a drug that several states have stopped using for its part in botched executions. There is just too much room for mistake. The state has faced several lawsuits about its execution procedure since its last execution in 2005, and there’s no proof that the new procedures are any better. On top of that, most U.S. death penalty states don’t even allow multiple executions in one day because of the strain it puts on victims’ families, inmates and prison staff. Arkansas wants to allow it four times in less than two weeks. Support for the death penalty is waning across the country as more people recognize that it does not increase public safety or bring closure to victims’ families, and that there is too big of a risk of executing an innocent person. It’s a complete waste of taxpayer money. Please join us in demanding that Governor Hutchinson rescind his approval for this unprecedented decision to execute eight people in 10 days!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:56:22.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
