The fed rate bears on employment, economic growth, and inflation. \nThe central bank said Wednesday that the Committee decided to “maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/2 to 3/4 percent.” The central bank economists state the decision to keep the funds rate steady comes after the economy did not meet the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation set last December. \nIn its determinations of any future rate increases, the Fed said that it would assess economic conditions at that time, and future periods, relative to its goal of full employment and 2 percent inflation. \nThe Committee did note some net-positives for the U.S. economy, including: improved job growth, lowering unemployment, and increased household spending and investment. \nThe Fed raised interest rates last December, marking only the second increase in the fed funds rate since June 2006. The Fed reduced interest rates to near zero during the 2007 financial crisis, where they have remained. \nSend tips to [email protected] Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
