That is why in the last House we established a committee known as the Committee on Legislative Compliance and the essence of that Committee is to seek to compel compliance with resolutions of the Legislature and the Committee is working. \n“They have a record of the resolutions that have been complied with and resolutions that have not been complied with. And for those that have not complied with the resolutions of the National Assembly, what we are trying to do is to give the Committee more bite. \n“So it’s something we are aware of and doing everything possible to ensure that there is more compliance with the resolutions of the National Assembly through the instrumentality of that Committee. \n“Also, I won’t call the role of the House of Representatives mediation as such, but I said that our principle is cooperation with the Senate so that together we can achieve more cooperation with the Executive. Where we will disagree, we will disagree. But in most areas we should look for ways of cooperating more than fight.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T17:21:20.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
