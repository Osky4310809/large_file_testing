Because I AM the World's Meanest Mom, and would love for her to be reminded every day next year of all of the mistakes she made.\"\nHer daughter’s friends reportedly flagged the ad, which led to its removal. Adams posted it a second time, and it was removed again.\nShe received more than 400 responses to the ad, about half of which were from supportive parents.\nAdams wants others to know it is necessary to discipline children instead of constantly trying to be their friends.\n\"Where's that going to leave them five years from now, 10 years from now, when they're walking around disrespecting the wrong people?\" Adams said.\nOn the WREG Facebook page, most of the comments commend Adams’ parenting skills.\n\"You go mom, parents these days are so scared of hurting their kids feelings and would rather be a friend to their kids than a parent,\" wrote Melissa Blaire Jarvis. \"That's what's wrong with society.\"\n\"Sounds like she's sending out a serious wake up call,\" wrote Mavis Sheffel. \"She gave her daughter chances to behave but she didn't sooo. Life lesson be Responsible . Good parent not mean mom at all.\"\n\"Since when is that mean?\" asked WREG’s George Brown. \"She shouldn't think of herself that way. She's doing her job as a parent.
