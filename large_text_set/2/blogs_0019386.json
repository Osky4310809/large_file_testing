Excerpts YOU have resolved to appeal the last Friday’s Appeal Court judgement, which ruled in favour of Senator Ali Modu Sheriff in the Supreme Court, why? First of all, why respecting their lordships and the view they expressed, it is our constitutional right to appeal any judgement that we do not subscribe to, especially if it is assessed and we find out that we have a strong ground to appeal. And the issue that has been explained to us is that, two, out of the three justices basically took a position that, holding the convention was a breach of two orders of court. One in Abuja, one in Port-Harcourt and those orders of court which indicated that the tenure of some officials, some will lapse in 2017 and some in 2018 and that, holding convention was a breach of those court orders. But, we have been advised long before we even went to court that, those matters have to do with elections, but it did not prevent convention from taking place. No any subsisting order says we should not hold convention and when you look at the PDP constitution, you will discover that power of convention is not limited to election, because convention can dissolve the party itself. Convention can suspend that constitution and take whatever decision it wants to take. Convention can promulgate a completely new constitution. Convention can elect and can remove. So, if convention, which was not stopped by any order from holding, removed, and we are not asked not to remove, we were only asked not to elect. There is a difference between election and removal. Now, in our opinion and opinion of our lawyers, the judgement was flopped, because we are not in breach of orders of the court. The dissenting judgement went along this line; that we are not in breach of that order and any order. Also the INEC report covering that convention, of which we have a certified copy, also indicated that we were not in breach of any court order. So, you see, we have strong ground to actually make an appeal. Now, that is where we are and as I said, we are concerned not just as a party; we are concerned for democracy. Because any attempt to curb the power of convention, we are saying bye-bye to democracy, because that is the supreme body of any political party and its power should not be directly and indirectly curbed by any court of law. What if the Supreme Court verdict also comes out in favour of Senator Ali Modu Sheriff? If that happens, it will be sad and it will be bad for democracy; that is all. But, having said that, even before the Port-Harcourt judgement, as political actors, we have also been looking at alternatives, because as politicians, we are not going to stop doing politics, but we will not also accept imposition of any kind, but we will not go in breach of what the court will say. As you mentioned earlier, you said Sheriff got judgement in his favour, fine but is he himself complying with the court judgement? He is not. Because what the court judgment said is that the party should revert to status quo before May 21. Status quo before May 21st; who was the Deputy National Chairman? Was it not Secondus? Olisa Metuh was the Publicity Secretary, Abubakar Mustapha, Organising Secretary and others. But, has he returned them? Rather, he is still parading himself and Cairo as Deputy National Chairman. Was he the deputy before 21 May? He is talking about planning a convention in two months’ time. That also is a breach of the Port-Harcourt judgement, because the Port- Harcourt judgement said there are some certain orders that the tenure of some officials will lapse sometimes in 2017 and some in 2018. So, convention to elect which offices, if that is the whole basis of the Port-Harcourt giving him judgement. So, even without the Supreme Court setting aside the Port-Harcourt judgement, you can’t even go for convention, you can only when the tenure of the three officers lapses, elect them and then you go for convention when the tenure of the rest 18 officers lapses and then you elect them. You can’t hold an all- inclusive convention; that is what the Port-Harcourt judgement is saying. But, that is what they are talking about. So, who is respecting the court position? We respect the court position, but we don’t accept it and that is why we are appealing. You talked about imposition of candidate, are you insinuating that Ali Modu Sheriff was imposed on the party? You see, democracy is about the will of the. The will of the majority has been loud and clear that they don’t want him to lead them. And we went for convention and a decision was taken. If any technicality is used to say that the majority must live by what they don’t accept, that is imposition. Secondly, two days ago or so, Governor of Imo State, Okorocha issued a press statement, condemning us, but praising and supporting Ali Sheriff. He is the Chairman of APC Governors’ Forum. What business has he got to do with PDP that he should take side? So, you can see the basis of that allegation that he is being imposed on the party for a purpose, otherwise, why should a serving APC governor and Chairman of APC Governors’ Forum get involved in PDP internal affairs? You talked about alternative plan if the Supreme Court doesn’t rule in your favour, what alternative are you considering? Let us wait for that time. Okay, while people from your camp accused Sheriff of being imposed by the ruling party, his loyalists have equally alleged that you are also being used. How will you react to this? By who? We have said who is using him, who has come out to support him. But, for me, who has come out to support me? Who has even come out to congratulate me? There is another presidential aide who congratulated Sheriff on Twitter when he won the court case. But, who has been heard, apart from PDP people, supporting me? Let them come out and say it. For us, theirs is obvious, everybody has seen it. Looking at the fact that both of you have governed your respective states, both of you have been Senators, why do you think you have a better claim to the leadership of the PDP than Senator Ali Modu Sheriff? I don’t have a better claim. Even at the last meeting, we held in Abuja last week, not just me, the Caretaker Committee volunteered that, if there is any legal impediment for us to function, we are prepared to handover to the Board of Trustees for it to administer the party, pending the resolution in court or anyhow. If we can offer this, it means that we are not sit-tight people. But, of course the meeting said it noted it, but that is not the issue now; anything to further cause confusion at the moment must not come. Look, even before the last meeting, several times, the Caretaker Committee had offered that it was prepared to give way and not to sit tight. But, when we give way, we want to give way in a situation where the problems will be solved, not in a situation where the problem will be compounded. Some would be asking, what is it that you want to do differently from what SAS is doing? We have heard them, some people have told us informally that there should be sharing of position. But, I am a democrat, I don’t believe in sharing positions; I believe that, a level playing field should be created where anybody seeking any office can freely seek for that office. When you begin to share, you begin to impose. Maybe, you can set up joint committee that is representative of both sides, that will conduct the convention, the primary and everything, so that we can all make sure that there is a level playing field for anybody seeking for any office from whatever side you are coming from; you can go out there and canvass for support, but not to begin by saying, no, you take this position for so, so person. Is that democratic? Is that how to rebrand PDP? Is that how to make PDP acceptable to the people? Was it not imposition that brought us to where we are? Do we continue with imposition? That is where the difference between us is. Should he be ready to collapse his structure into your Caretaker Committee, will you be ready to work with him? As it is, except the Supreme Court rules in favour of the Caretaker Committee, that is not even something you can talk about. If the Supreme Court rules in our favour and in the spirit of reconciliation, that is an issue to be looked at. Look, punitive measure is not what we are contemplating. Reconciliation is the key word, but the reconciliation must be genuine reconciliation and one that can stand the test of time; the reconciliation that cannot be challenged legally. But if we try to cut corners, just the way Sheriff has been to several courts, other people can go to court too. So, whatever we do, we should learn from our experiences and not create a situation where some other aggrieved people will hold the party to ransom by going to court to challenge our actions again. PDP governors seem to be more comfortable with you than Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, why are they backing you? I don’t really know; I have not taken census of that. But those who are supporting me are only reasonable, they know, that if I am required to go now, I will not fight to stay, which is different from him. Do you get the point? They know that my position is, let us do things the right way at the right moment, in such a way that it will not hurt the party. Why do you think he is fighting hard, do you think it is in the interest of the party, or he has ulterior motive? Mixed grill, mixed grill. He has his own interest and ambition as he is free to have; we all are free to have. Secondly, the fact that even if it is just mere suspicion, but the fact that APC henchmen have started coming out in his defense is a clear testimony to the fact that he is not in control of his own affairs. And then, there are those PDP members surrounding him, who have localised interests; as long as their localised interests are not done the way they want, they will not subscribe to any peace. I don’t have such people, but he has them. Maybe, even if he wants to make peace, there may be forces that may make it more difficult for him to make peace, I don’t know, maybe he can answer this. How comfortable are you with his latest romance with former President Goodluck Jonathan? What romance? Maybe I even see former President Jonathan more than he does, but I don’t come out to publicise that I have met him, I have discussed this and that, that is disrespectful. You don’t meet leaders and come out to publicise what you have discussed with them. For your information, before he met Jonathan, I met him and I have met him after that, but why do I come out and tell the world that I just met President Jonathan and we discussed ABCD….? The former President and I know what we discussed and that is our internal affairs and we know what to do. Don’t you think PDP under Senator Ali Sheriff has been able to form a formidable opposition? It has not, certainly not. Have you ever heard Sheriff and his group ever coming out to condemn anything the government has done wrongly? Anytime you hear something, it is from our own group. So, if it is truly an opposition, why is it that all their condemnations are on us, not any government policy or action? What do you think all these crises portend for the PDP ahead of 2019? Well, whatever the outcome, PDP must re-organise, must rebrand and must re-strategize. We have been bashed, some due to our own mistakes, but we have been bashed from all sides. Our mistakes are there, which we acknowledge, which we are working hard to correct, some we have corrected and we will correct the rest. We have interferences that are prolonging our internal crises, which we hope we will overcome. My plea is that the Supreme Court should do justice, justice that is good for democracy. Look, if opposition is killed and you end up by omission or commission to create a one party state, it will be terrible for this country. If you are safe today, you may not be safe tomorrow, whether you are judiciary, whether you are a journalist, whether you are a civil society organisation or whatever you may be. It is in the interest of this country that you have a formidable opposition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:54:03.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
