In total, 26 people died in similar twilight raids over the span of two days on neighbouring villages. \nThe latest phase of a decades-long conflict over land has claimed at least 200 lives since October last year, according to conservative estimates — more than those killed by feared Boko Haram Islamists in the northeast in the same period. \nThe land wars have disrupted food production at a time when shortages caused by Boko Haram’s insurgency have brought some areas of the remote region to the brink of famine. \nWithout a national strategy in place, the tension between herdsmen and farmers has been building over the past year. \nExperts blame a heavy-handed, militarised response by the government, and incendiary comments from political and religious leaders for fanning the flames of animosity. \nSola Tayo, associate fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House, said that with Boko Haram the conflict “is a lot more clear cut, you know the enemy”. \nHowever, the fact that the land wars are “being manipulated by so many different players just fuels violence”, Tayo added. \n– Law and order ‘breakdown’– \nMost of the women and children in Bakin Kogi have left. They have been replaced by military and policemen, who are now stationed in the village and run checkpoints on the major roads. \nThe closest town, Kafanchan, is under a 24-hour curfew. \nThe village reeks of smoke and the spiced honey smell of ginger, one of the region’s staple crops heaped in charred piles around the burnt houses. \nGroups of armed vigilantes hold meetings under the cool shade of broad mango trees, while others patrol the dusty dirt roads on motorbikes. \nThey look apprehensive, but also resolute. They have heard another attack is coming. \nNigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari — a Hausa-speaking Fulani Muslim — has faced intense criticism for only speaking out about the conflict following an attack in December last year. \nHe is now on indefinite sick leave in London. \nKaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s response has been to call in the troops and blame “conflict entrepreneurs” for stoking violence. \nEl-Rufai announced early in February a ramped-up security presence, including two battalions and 10 mobile units, as well as daily airforce surveillance. \nBut the politicians, who claim Fulani heritage, have struggled to convince the people of southern Kaduna that farmers’ interests are being protected as clashes continue to erupt. \nMeanwhile in Nigeria’s largely Christian south, pastors and politicians are calling for farmers to defend themselves in the face of “rampaging herdsmen”. \n“Neither the Kaduna government nor the federal government are perceived as impartial arbitrators,” Nigerian political analyst Chris Ngwodo said. \n“It is more accurate to see the southern Kaduna conflict as a subset of a broader crisis of state failure and the breakdown of law and order.” \n– Booming population – \nFulani leaders are quick to accuse the farmers of hypocrisy, frequently pointing to attacks on herdsmen and their valuable cattle. \n“It’s not in our nature to attack,” said Ibrahim Abdullahi, from the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN). \n“A Fulani man has ‘Fulaku’,” he added, referring to an ancient moral code that emphasises honesty, humility and family honour. \n“But we will do what we need to do to protect our lives and heritage.” \nThe conflict has often been characterised as a religious one but that ignores long-standing grievances and complex ethnic rivalry that dates back hundreds of years. \nFor Abdullahi, the real driver of the conflict stems from Nigeria’s booming population, which the United Nations has estimated to be one of the fastest-growing in the world. \nDemand for land has chipped away at traditional grazing routes. \nOne suggested solution is to settle the herdsmen and introduce modern ranching techniques. \nBut with millions of Fulani still leading a nomadic life, that requires some kind of national government policy to address the resource scarcity. \nUntil then, peace will be elusive, predicted Moses Ochonu, an African history professor at Vanderbilt University in the United States. \n“Unless a permanent solution is found to nomadic herding, herder-farmer conflicts will intensify. It may be time to rethink the entire paradigm of herding.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T17:14:53.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
