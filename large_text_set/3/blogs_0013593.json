According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport , Cook is scheduled to visit the Minnesota Vikings and Oakland Raiders, with the latter considered a \"strong landing spot\" should he leave his meeting in Minnesota without a deal. On Monday, Rapoport reported Cook had a meeting scheduled with the Seattle Seahawks â€”who could use a dynamic pass-catching complement at tight end alongside Jimmy Graham . And based on his resume through eight seasons, Cook likely won't function as more than a supplementary receiving option at his next stop. Although a high-ankle sprain played a role in limiting his production last season (30 catches, 377 yards, one touchdown), Cook has never parlayed his 6'4'', 235-pound frame into a status as one of the league's more dynamic players at the position. To date, Cook hasn't topped five touchdowns in a single season or 800 yards receiving. Plus, he finished the 2016 campaign with a minus-11.7 percent DVOA which \"r epresents value, per play, over an average TE in the same game situations,\" according to Football Outsiders . Should Cook latch on with the Vikings, he would likely factor into the picture as a capable No. 2 tight end behind Kyle Rudolph who can provide a fairly static passing game with another dimension in the red zone. As far as the Raiders are concerned, Cook could see a heavier snap count as he seeks to slot in next to Clive Walford and take over the vacant roster spot occupied last season by Mychal Rivera.
