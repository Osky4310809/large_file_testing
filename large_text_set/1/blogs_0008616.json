(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) GOP senators seek to delay Obamacare repeal vote By Robert King â€¢ 1/9/17 7:34 PM Robert King Healthcare Correspondent The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/King-3.jpg More \nA group of Republican senators wary about repealing Obamacare without a replacement want to delay the repeal until at least March. \nThe Senate is voting this week on a budget resolution that starts the repeal process and directs House and Senate committees to create repeal legislation by Jan. 27. \nHowever, a Senate amendment introduced by five Republican senators seeks to extend the deadline until March 3. That would ensure a responsible process for repealing the law quickly, they said. \n\"This amendment will give the incoming administration more time to outline its priorities after its chief healthcare official assumes office and fully reviews the tools currently at his disposal,\" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. \"By extending the deadline for budget reconciliation instructions until March, Congress and the incoming administration will each have additional time to get the policy right.\" \n  \nSens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana joined Corker in introducing the amendment, which will be voted on later this week. \nRepublicans want to repeal the law but leave it intact for a few years while a replacement is created, but Corker and Collins have expressed doubts about repealing the law without an immediate replacement.
