Now that the ceremony itself is well underway, it’s time to let you in on one of the most touching moments of the awards show. Legendary actor, Shatrughan Sinha was just presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award, and as warranted for a star of his status, the honour was bestowed with much fanfare. Shatrughan Sinha with daughter Sonakshi \nFirst, the Badshah himself, Shah Rukh Khan announced the award, followed by Subhash Ghai, who came in to pay a beautiful tribute to the Shotgun. “Even today, he will smile like a child if you clap for him, please clap for him” said Ghai, to an audience that needed no prompting. It was a long speech, but the director really nailed it when he said, “… But when you look back at his achievements, it is enviable. It is too long a list to refer to, with his achievements. You have to refer to Wikipedia to know …” Another part that got us in the feels was when Ghai stated, “His story says: it does not matter if you belong to a small town, or if you don’t have money in your pocket. Or if you’re not too literate to sit with affluent society. You can achieve all, you can become big, if you have one thing … that is confidence. That is Shatrughan Sinha.” Shatrughan, dapper in blue, looked extremely touched throughout the long speech and through an A.V of his movies, and then came the best part … his daughter, Sonakshi Sinha and colleague (and fellow baller), Amitabh Bachchan presented the award to him! “I feel very, very minuscule in front of them [referring to the people paying tribute to her father], but like my father always reminds me, that I am a worthy daughter of a worthy father, he is my privilege, pride and honour … and he’s always said that I am his first and favorite lifetime achievement award, but thank you Filmfare, for giving him this honor and now I shall give the mic to his very, very dear friend and colleague, who needs no introduction, “ said a beaming Sonakshi, leading up to the Big B. Mr. Bachchan, in the most perfect Hindi (of course) narrated stories about their friendship, and how he, in turn, was so honoured to present this award to such a deserving man. Sonakshi Sinha at Jio Filmfare Awards 2017 While Shatrughan’s acceptance speech was flamboyant, super entertaining and extremely heartfelt, we particularly loved how he ended it. “ Yeh ek beginning of the end nahin hai . Yeh ek end bhi nahin hai . Yeh beginning of the beginning hai ! Zindigai ki asli ladayi abhi baaki hai. Mere iraadon ka imtihan abhi baki hai . Abhi to napi hai muthi bhar zameen humne . Aage aur aasman baaki hai...” Congratulations, Mr Sinha!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:10:33.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
