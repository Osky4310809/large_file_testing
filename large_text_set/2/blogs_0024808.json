(Cesar Ramirez) \nURBIZTONDO, Pangasinan, Philippines – It’s like a death sentence and he is stressed out, but his tears have dried and he is ready to face his fate. \nThis was how Ronnie Dayan, the former driver and lover of Sen. Leila de Lima, described himself after he was arrested on drug charges by police here last Thursday night on orders of the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court (RTC). \nDayan was picked up by local police armed with the arrest warrant at his home in Sitio Aplaya, Barangay Galarin in this town. \nHe told local journalists while undergoing booking procedures that since attending the congressional hearings on the illegal drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP), he had been constantly under stress. \nDayan said he had restless nights thinking about his fate and took his mind off his problems by tending his corn farm. \nDayan managed to smile as his mug shot was taken and he was talking to the media. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \n“My tears were dried up this afternoon with my relatives,” he said, referring to the time they learned about the issuance of the arrest warrant. “I told them this is it and I have to face it.” \nDayan said he was clinging to prayers to overcome this challenge. He likened his arrest to certain death, as there is no bail for the charges he is facing. \nEven if he were granted bail, Dayan said he did not have the money for it. \nProsecutors allege that De Lima, as justice secretary during the presidency of Benigno Aquino III, received payoffs from convicts running drug trafficking operations at the NBP to finance her senatorial campaign. \nThe payoffs were allegedly solicited by Dayan. \nDayan denied being a power broker when he worked for De Lima. \nHe claimed he even had to distance himself from De Lima because many wanted to seek his help. \nDayan said he had no more communication with De Lima since the time he went into hiding to avoid the hearings in Congress. \nHe was found in a farm in a remote village in La Union in November last year. \nAfter appearing in congressional and Senate hearings, Dayan was brought back to his hometown in Urbiztondo. \nSince then, Dayan said he kept himself abreast of developments mainly by watching the news on television. \nHe said he had expected his arrest warrant would be issued soon so when the news broke that the Muntinlupa court had issued the warrant, he was not surprised. \nHe then gathered his family and told them that he would surrender and had full trust in the police. “I leave everything to God,” he said. \nDayan was temporarily detained at the Urbiztondo jail before he was brought to the Muntinlupa RTC yesterday. \nHe appeared before the court an hour after De Lima. \nThe court committed Dayan to the custody of the Muntinlupa City police where he was separated from other detainees for his safety. \nDayan, in an interview over GMA-7, admitted he is a bit worried for his safety. \n“I hope nothing happens to me,” he said. \nDayan became emotional upon his arrest, saying he would no longer have time with his children and grandchildren. \n“I think it will be a long time before we see each other again,” he said. – Emmanuel Tupas Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:46:19.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
