Image © Michael Moran \nFounded in the late 1970s as a non-collecting institution, the Aspen Art Museum worked in tandem with the design team to determine programmatic needs and to ensure its new home completely supported the art it hangs. Adhering to a strict 18-month construction schedule, the new museum opened in 2014 and has seen a 400 percent increase in visitorship and a 1,140 percent increase in the number of students served by the museum’s educational outreach initiatives. Three floors—two above ground, one below—are dedicated to gallery space, while the top floor includes an ample multiuse space, café, and public terrace with sweeping views of the Rockies. \n\nCarmel Place / nARCHITECTS \nCarmel Place / nARCHITECTS. Image © Pablo Enriquez \nWinner of the 2012 adAPT NYC competition for New York City’s first micro-unit apartment building, Carmel Place represents a new housing paradigm for the city's growing small household population. The design of the 9 story building’s 55 units aims for spaciousness and luminosity through the implementation of 9’-8” ceilings, 8’ tall sliding windows and Juliet balconies . With a goal of conveying the residents’ nested scales of community, afforded by varied interior and exterior shared spaces, the building’s brick exterior massing resembles four slender “mini-towers” – a microcosm of the city’s skyline. \n\nCarnegie Hall Studio Towers Renovation Project / Iu + Bibliowicz Architects LLP \nCarnegie Hall Studio Towers Renovation Project / Iu + Bibliowicz Architects LLP. Image © Jeff Goldberg \nThe Carnegie Hall Studio Towers Renovation Project centered on: renovation, reorganization, and repurposing of 167,000 square feet of non-performance venues at the National Historic site. The 7-year project encompassed the creation of a Music Education Wing, new roof terrace, consolidation of administrative offices, expanded backstage space and functionality, and façade lighting to showcase the landmark. Substantial interior structural modifications and infrastructure upgrades aided in the success of the renovation. The project was awarded LEED Silver Certification, one of the oldest and most notable buildings in the country with such distinction. \n\nThe Cotton Gin at the CO-OP District / Antenora Architects LLP \nThe Cotton Gin at the CO-OP District / Antenora Architects LLP. Image © Brian Mihaelsick \nThe reuse of the two existing cotton gin structures is the first piece of a 2012 master plan to revitalize the site, which was purchased by the City of Hutto. Both structures were selectively deconstructed and reused to create a single open-air 6,500-square-foot public events space. The new building is wrapped in perforated stainless steel that reflects the hot Texas sun during the day and provides intriguing transparency at night. The design team succeeded in creating a flexible space for public and private events that complements everything from programmatic functions of the local library and farmer’s markets to artisan fairs and wedding receptions. \n\nGrace Farms / SANAA\nAssociate Firm: Handel Architects\nGrace Farms / SANAA. Image © Iwan Baan \nGrace Farms was established with the idea that “space communicates” and can inspire people to collaborate for good. To realize this vision, Grace Farms Foundation appointed SANAA to create a porous, multipurpose building nestled within an 80-acre landscape that would encourage people to engage with nature, the arts, justice, community, and faith. The River building emerged as a new kind of public space that embodies these aspirations. Its sinuous structure is comprised of 203 individually curved glass panels containing five volumes: a sanctuary; library; commons; pavilion; and partially submerged Court. \n\nReva and David Logan Center for the Arts / Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects\nAssociate Firm: Holabird & Root\nReva and David Logan Center for the Arts / Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects. Image © Tom Rossiter \nSitting on the southern edge of Chicago’s Midway, the Center houses the University of Chicago’s visual arts, film, music, and theater programs, finally uniting the programs under one roof. The building comprises a 10-story tower and an adjacent two-story “podium.” Both are clad in Missouri limestone cut into four-foot lengths and laid as bricks. The material echoes the limestone found on the University’s neo-Gothic structures as well as Frank Lloyd Wright’s Robie House, also located on campus. Bathed in natural light, the smaller building is lit by north-facing skylights throughout its many creative spaces. \n\nSt. Ann's Warehouse / Marvel Architects \nSt. Ann's Warehouse / Marvel Architects. Image © David Sundberg/ESTO \nBeneath the Brooklyn Bridge, Marvel Architects has brought the brick and mortar ruins of the historic Tobacco Warehouse back to life, creating a new theater space for renowned presenter St. Ann's Warehouse. Leading a team of Silman, Buro Happold and Charcoalblue, Marvel created a controlled acoustical environment using natural state materials - concrete, blackened steel, Douglas fir plywood. With a respectful sleight of hand, a new roof floats atop a ribbon of solid glass brick. Adjacent to the theater is a trapezoidal garden designed with Michael Van Valkenberg Landscape. \n\nThe Six Affordable Veteran Housing / Brooks + Scarpa \nThe Six Affordable Veteran Housing / Brooks + Scarpa. Image © Tara Wujcik \nThe SIX is a 52-unit LEED Platinum affordable housing and support services building for disabled veterans. Located in the MacArthur Park area of Los Angeles which has one of the highest densities in the USA with a total population of 120,000 people in 2.72 square miles. The SIX breaks the prescriptive mold of the traditional shelter by creating public and private \"zones\" in which private space is deemphasized, in favor of large public areas. The organization is intended to transform the way people live-away from a reclusive, isolating layout towards a community-oriented, interactive space. \n\nStanford University Central Energy Facility / ZGF Architects LLP \nStanford University Central Energy Facility / ZGF Architects. Image © Matthew Anderson \nThe Central Energy Facility is the heart of Stanford University's transformational campus-wide energy system, projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 68%. The centerpiece of this composition of large, industrial components is a central courtyard pivoting around a 2.5-million-gallon hot water thermal storage tank, showcasing the energy plant’s mission. The architecture takes its cues from Stanford’s rich heritage: the Stanford arcade is reimagined as PV trellis; integrally colored cast-in-place concrete nods to the prevalent limestone; and weathered CorTen steel accents suggest terra-cotta tile roofs that give the campus much of its character. \n\nTHREAD: Artists' Residency and Cultural Center / Toshiko Mori Architect \nTHREAD: Artists' Residency and Cultural Center / Toshiko Mori Architect. Image © Iwan Baan \nLocated in the remote village of Sinthian, Senegal, this project offers multiple programs for the community, including a gathering space, performance center, and residency for visiting artists. In the design, a parametric transformation of the traditional pitched roof inscribes a series of courtyards within the plan of the building while also creating shaded, multi-purpose areas around the perimeter of the courtyard. The inversion of the roof creates an effective strategy for the collection and storage of rainwater, capable of fulfilling substantial domestic and agricultural water needs for the community. Relying exclusively on local materials and construction techniques, the building’s traditional structure is formed primarily of bamboo and spaced-brick walls that absorb heat and promote airflow through the building interior. \n\nYale Center for British Art Building Conservation Project / Knight Architecture \nYale Center for British Art Building Conservation Project / Knight Architecture. Image © Richard Caspole \nFollowing nearly forty years of continuous operation, the Yale Center for British Art, designed by Louis I. Kahn and recipient of AIA ’s Twenty-five Year Award, faced mounting programmatic, infrastructural, and operational pressures which threatened to degrade its extraordinary architectural character. The multi-year conservation project renewed interior finishes that had grown tired and worn; restored and expanded teaching spaces that were oversubscribed and underequipped; fortified spaces for exhibition, storage, and study of the growing collection; and replaced vital building systems which had reached the end of their practical life. \n2017 Institute Honor Awards for Interior Architecture \n\n30 Rockefeller Plaza: 65th Floor, Rainbow Room, SixtyFive / Gabellini Sheppard Associates \nAssociate Firm: Montroy Andersen DeMarco\n30 Rockefeller Plaza: 65th Floor, Rainbow Room, SixtyFive / Gabellini Sheppard Associates. Image © Paul Warchol \nGabellini Sheppard Associates opened a new chapter for the 13,160-square-foot Rainbow Room and 65 th floor, blending contemporary needs with design that rekindled the room’s original Art Deco-inspired spirit and radiant notoriety of 1934. In the Rainbow Room, the revitalization of the rotating dance floor, addition of mesmerizing crystal window veils, and restoration of the chandelier and central dome, reinforce the modern-day grandeur. In Bar SixtyFive, a faceted ceiling composed of glass-reinforced gypsum panels anchor the space, reinterpreting the open-air height the room once had as a sun parlor. \n\nGeneral Motors Design Auditorium / SmithGroupJJR \nGeneral Motors Design Auditorium / SmithGroupJJR. Image © James Haefner Photography \nIn 1956, the General Motors styling team moved from Detroit to a new design space. The complex, originally designed by Eero Saarinen, has become a legendary corporate master piece of planning and design. For SmithGroupJJR, the overall design intent was to modernize the facility but to do so in a manner consistent with the original Saarinen detailing. Technologies of materials, lighting and audio/visual have progressed dramatically and the revised Design Dome is now poised for General Motors to re-establish the relevance of this significant space for the design community. \n\nGeorge Washington University, Milken Institute School of Public Health / Payette \nAssociate Firm: Ayers Saint Gross \nMilken Institute School of Public Health / Payette. Image © Robert Benson \nLocated on iconic Washington Circle Park in the heart of the nation’s capital, this School of Public Health is a rigorous, innovative response to site and program. With its most sustainable solutions so deeply embedded as to be nearly indistinguishable, it keenly demonstrates the symbiotic relationship between sustainability and public health. The building’s unusual skylit atrium, in which classrooms and study areas overlook the city through an open latticework of floor openings, invites exploration and discovery. The building supports a highly effective learning and interaction environment that is equally memorable for its intimacy and transparency. \n\nIn Situ / Aidlin Darling Design \nIn Situ / Aidlin Darling Design. Image © Matthew Millman \nLocated in the recently reopened San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA), In Situ represents a unique intersection of art, design, food and community. The restaurant features a curated collection of culinary innovators from around the world to make their contributions accessible for greater public engagement. Its design operates at many scales from urban to the intimate, and is intended to engage all of the senses with an emphasis on tactility and acoustics. The exposed interior shell of the building provides a backdrop for discreetly placed \"artifacts\" which include commissioned art, custom designed lighting, custom furniture and a sculptural wood ceiling.\n\nPinterest HQ / IwamotoScott Architecture with Brereton Architects \ninterest HQ / IwamotoScott Architecture with Brereton Architects. Image © Bruce Damonte \nThe new Pinterest headquarters is inspired by the redesign of the company's web platform — clean, simple, intuitive. It occupies a concrete structure in the SOMA district that previously housed a John Deer factory. A key aspect of the design extends the existing atrium through to the ground floor, spatially connecting all four floors. The Knitting Stair occupies this newly-activated heart of the building. The workspace program is organized as porous, concentric layers around the atrium and Knitting Stair, opening up to the city at the ground floor’s lobby, café, all-hands space and maker lab. \n\nUniversity of Massachusetts (UMass) Dartmouth, Claire T. Carney Library / designLAB architects\nAssociate Firm: Austin Architects\nUniversity of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Claire T. Carney Library / designLAB Architects. Image © Jonathan Hillyer \nConceived in 1963 as a utopian community by architect Paul Rudolph, the UMass Dartmouth campus remains a tour de force of late 20 th -century architectural exuberance and optimism. The Claire T. Carney Library is the 160,000-square-foot centerpiece of the concentric campus plan. designLAB’s transformation celebrates the historic architecture, while creating a state-of-the-art learning environment, improved group study spaces, a cafe, a lecture space, and a new campus living room. Inspired by Rudolph’s original design intentions, the renovation included the re-introduction of a vibrant color palette, bold supergraphics, and dynamic social spaces. \n\nWriters Theatre / Studio Gang \nWriters Theatre / Studio Gang. Image © Hedrich Blessing \nWhile functional requirements of performance venues often dictate opaque volumes, the 36,000-square-foot Writers Theatre is instead a transparent cultural anchor that embraces its community. A double-height lobby provides a flexible space for outreach, gatherings, and performances, with glass doors that open to the adjacent park. Clad in wood hewn from the site, box office and concessions are treated as furniture, integrated into flexible lobby tribune seating. A canopy walk hung from timber trusses provides an open-air gathering place before, after, and between shows. The two stages are configured to enhance the intimacy for which Writers is known while creating new opportunities for innovative performance. \n\nMore information on the awards can be found here .\n\nNew and project descriptions via AIA. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:14:09.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
