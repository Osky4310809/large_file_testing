Obama decided to use illegal executive orders and regulatory bias to move the balance in favour of the environment over business creating a huge backlash.\nThe Economist (as usual in his partisan views) forgot the victory for property rights and individual liberty came via the unanimous Supreme Court decision last June against EPA’s ability to control the “environment” on private property—though their use of wetlands “jurisdictional determinations” under the Clean Water Act. The high court’s opinion states that land owners are now able to challenge government agencies that attempt to assert control over the environment of private property before any permitting process by the owner begins—versus after the owners expenditure of time, effort and expense to obtain a permit. Furthermore, this court’s decision will limit the government’s ability to restrict land owners activities through the application of EPA’s “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) rule issued last year.\nThere has been many other decisions on a similar way that clearly showed that Obama's regulation were illegal.\nThen there is the fallout from EPA’s regulatory agenda—particularly the Clean Power Plan—their crown jewel of carbon emissions rulemaking. Although the CPP was stayed, EPA officials are not deterred and are now moving ahead with key components of the plan, particularly in those 17 states lead by democrat governors. The EPA may be flagrantly violating the law by ignoring the Supreme Court ruling on the CPP. According to the electric utility industry, 30 states, and their state agencies, all of whom are suing to eliminate the plan—EPA is absolutely in violation.\nThe Economist please a little more of research. Every one love a clean environment. It is fundamental to achieve it without destroying businesses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:19:26.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
