It’s pretty sad. \n“If he was a criminal, I’d cop it. But they have just taken him away for association. \n“It’s fair enough if he’s done something… to be just taken away for no reason and breaking up the family. I think it’s pretty stupid.” \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS. Get your free 2-week FOXTEL PLAY trial and start watching in minutes.

Instead, the 25-year-old drew a comparison between his association with Richmond and his dad’s current bikie associates. \n“Just because he’s in a club, you can’t just say that he’s doing something wrong,” the 2016 All-Australian said. \n“There are plenty of clubs out there. I’m in a footy club. He’s in a bikie club. They join and get together and go for rides. I go to my club and play football.” \nLate last year, Shane Martin submitted a claim to return to Australia, saying he was of Aboriginal decent. The claim was rejected by a three-member board in early January. \nMartin had hoped to use the confirmation to appeal his deportation. \n“Many of these criminals will claim that they are being picked at random somehow or that we are picking people that don’t have criminal histories. It’s nonsense,” Minister Dutton told Channel 9. \n“We are looking at those criminals who have been identified by police and intelligence agencies around the country that are the highest value targets.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:37:15.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
