The A-series smartphones spread across three different screen sizes and configurations in order to help Samsung’s brand in lower price brackets.\nThe main highlights this year with the A-series is that all of the phones in this lineup are now bearing IP68 certification for water and dust resistance. Further, all the phones come with a USB Type-C port, making them better equipped for the future. Other common features across the devices include the fingerprint sensor on the front home button, Super AMOLED display , Dual SIM options and Samsung Pay with MST functionality. \nThe phones also sport the same design language, just in different sizes as has been the trend with the A-series. You get an aluminum mid-frame on the device, followed along with glass on the back. This means that you do not have the privilege of removable batteries that once used to be commonplace, although you do get microSD expandability up to 256GB. Samsung’s press release is also silent on the exact specifics of the SoC used in each of these devices as well. The speakers on the devices are also unconventionally placed on the right hand side near the power button, instead of the bottom of the mid-frame.\nGalaxy A3 2017 Galaxy A5 2017 Galaxy A7 2017 Display 4.7″ HD 5.2″ FHD 5.7″ FHD Processor 1.6 GHz, Octa Core 1.9 GHz, Octa Core 1.9 GHz, Octa Core RAM 2GB 3GB 3GB Internal Storage 16GB 32GB 32GB Rear Camera 13MP, f/1.9 16MP, f/1.9 16MP, f/1.9 Front Camera 8MP, f/1.9 16MP, f/1.9 16MP, f/1.9 Battery 2350 mAh 3000 mAh 3600 mAh Fast Charging No Yes Yes The most disappointing part of the phones is perhaps Samsung’s decision to release the devices with Android 6.0 Marshmallow , with their Touchwiz skin. OEMs often support devices up to a limited major Android releases, so even if the devices do receive Android 7.1 Nougat in a timely manner, this will count against the device’s future-proofing. Of course, since this is a Samsung device, so you also get KNOX functionality out of the box.\nThe Galaxy A series devices will be available in Russia in early-January and then expand on to global markets. Pricing information is unknown at this stage.\nAssuming that the SoC is the same on the A5 2017 and the A7 2017, the A5 2017 makes for a good mid range device that is not handicapped in terms of specs when compared to its larger brother. The exact SoC will determine if the device can stand against flagships at all, but we are not holding our breaths on this one.\nWhat are your thoughts on the 2017 A-series devices from Samsung?
