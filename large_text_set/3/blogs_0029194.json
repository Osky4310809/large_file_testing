Grossed out? Impressed? — by the Baywatch fuscia-band trailer whenever it's finally released to the public, read no further. (And if you're about to eat, you also may consider reading no further.)\nSo here's the setup: Mitch Buchanan (Dwayne Johnson), Matt Brody (Zac Efron) and Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) are low-key investigating the circumstances of a man's death, and have arrived in a morgue to check out his body for injuries. Mitch lifts up the cadaver's sheet and whoop!\nOut pops the dead penis.\nMitch tricks the dim-witted Matt into inspecting it for \"needle marks.\" He makes him lift it, grab it and get uncomfortably close to it, which causes him to over-describe the smells he's experiencing, all a ruse to snap a few sly photos for the sole purpose of his ultimate humiliation.\nOf course at that moment, the villains arrive, and the Baywatch gang hides out in the cadaver drawers where, after a moment, some mystery goop starts dripping on Matt's face. Learning that it's \"liquid fat\" from a body decomposing above, he comes shooting out of the drawer — and giving away the team.\nBut no amount of decomposing jelly is ever going to wash away the image of a dead man's genitals popping out on the big screen when you least expect it.\nBaywatch opens May 26, when you can see it for yourself.\nWATCH: Will Smith looks fly even while jumping off a bridge", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/iCsjLofY.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wOgBze0fQhyUnju_j4v1d87vf4I=/http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fthumbs%2FiCsjLofY.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-29T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:49:33.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
