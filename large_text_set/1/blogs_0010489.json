I am on a different level where I can face other fighters and get the same amount of money. I want him to keep hold of that IBF title because I want to take it off him. Amir Khan \n\"I have always said to Kell and Eddie Hearn that the fight is going to be worth more money if there is a title on the line. It will be a bigger fight not only in Britain but around the world. I want him to keep hold of that IBF title because I want to take it off him. \n\"He has that defence to make against Errol Spence, and we are going to let him make that defence, keep hold of the title, and then the fight can happen between me and him. Kell Brook is due to defend his IBF belt against Spence Jr in the next few months \n\"I think it is a great fight for me. I respect Kell. I think he is a great fighter and it is about time now we both get it on. I have left it to my team. I have told my team that this is the fight I want and if it makes sense financially, let's make it happen.\" \nThe Bolton fighter would prefer to face Brook at the end of the year and expects to take a warm-up fight in the spring following hand surgery. Amir Khan is keen to take a warm-up fight before facing Brook \n\"I'm in the States now and had a meeting with Al Haymon last week,\" said Khan. \"He said to me with the hand operation, we want to get a good feel fight, to get back into it again. \n\"It has been almost a year since I last fought so I want to get back in there to get that ring rust away. I want to fight again March or April time. I should find out within the next month.\" Watch Badou Jack v James DeGale live on Sky Sports 1 HD on Saturday night from 2am.
