Increasingly, young people are moving into cities to rent , not buy, and many prefer to spend their money on experiences over material goods. Saddled with extraordinary college debt, some millennials feel they don't yet have the means to replicate their parents' behavior just yet. \nBut there's another way to read Sløk's findings, which is that millennials will represent such a large chunk of the spending economy — there are 83 million of them, after all — that what they spend money on won't matter as much. \nMillennials may echo their parents' behavior in stimulating the economy through spending, but instead of new cars and houses, the hallmarks could become ride-sharing and a desire to travel the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T19:29:20.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
