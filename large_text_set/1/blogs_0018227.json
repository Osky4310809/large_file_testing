A lot of people come to Manila on business, so you don’t want them to travel a very long distance,” he said. \nWhile Singapore Airlines would want to expand operations in Manila by adding a fifth daily flight, the carrier is constrained, given congestion at the NAIA. \nGoh said the carrier has conveyed interest to add a fifth flight on the Manila to Singapore route, but was told by regulators there are no slots available, at present. \nDespite the lack of slots to increase operations in Manila, Singapore Airlines has a positive outlook on the Philippine market given the country’s strong economic growth. \n“We see Philippines at present, as one of key markets we fly to in this region. And because of strong economic growth, there will be a lot of inbound (tourists) as well,” he said. \nSingapore Airlines is the parent airline of the Singapore Airlines Group which is composed of regional full service carrier SilkAir and low cost carrier subsidiaries Scoot and Tiger Airways. \nThe group currently serves a total of 132 destinations across 36 countries. \nAs part of the celebration of Singapore Airlines’ 70th Global Anniversary, the carrier is holding its largest showcase and travel fair in different parts of the country where customers can avail of affordable promo fares as well as other exclusive perks and offerings. \nFor bookings and inquiries, customers can visit the Singapore Airlines Ticket Office, call SIA Manila Reservations at 756-8888, SilkAir Cebu at 6332-505-7871, SilkAir Davao at 6382-227-5301, SilkAir Kalibo at 6336-500-7226, contact any participating travel agent until Feb. 20, or check singaporeair.com/FLYSQ70.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:20:38.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
