This raises the question: Could the Instagram star have made all his riches from poker? Long Story \nIt's easy to hate Dan Bilzerian, but it's hard not to be jealous. \nThe Instagram bro's photos of nude models, cash, guns, super exotic locations, airplanes and yachts, will make anyone's eyes pop out of their heads. But is the guy a fraud? America is rioting in the streets over the election, in other news, weed is now legal in Nevada A photo posted by Dan Bilzerian (@danbilzerian) on Nov 10, 2016 at 10:52am PST \nBilzerian has always said he became a millionaire thanks to his poker, despite having an ex-millionaire father. His pops was jailed for nine counts of stock and tax fraud , but there might have been some money left for little Danny. \nDoug Polk, who runs poker tutorial site Upswing Poker shared a video on his YouTube channel in which he analyses an online poker game played by Bilzerian. Most of the moves played by Bilzerian, according to Polk, are complete sh*t. \nSo if Bilzerian sucks so much at poker, could he really have made all his money from it? \n“He claims to have made all of his money from poker,\" Polk said. \"Yet his dad made a lot of money, but in the '80s went to jail and was forced to pay a $50-60 million fine and only paid a few million. The money is missing and we just don’t know where it went.” \nSure, one guy's disagreement about Bilzerian's poker game doesn't necessarily mean he's a big fat liar. But a 2015 investigation into Bilzerian by GQ couldn't rule out that Bilzerian has as much money as he says he has and that he didn't get started thanks to trust funds from his dad. \nIt's too soon to say if Bilzerian is a spoiled brat rather than a poker star, but it'd be a huge relief if that's the case.

Drop This Fact \nBilzerian told Howard Stern in 2014 that his net worth is $100 million.
