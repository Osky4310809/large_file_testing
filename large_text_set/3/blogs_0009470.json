He opined that Nigerians are happy that the president is back to continue his good works. Orji Uzor Kalu \nHe said: ”Now that the president is back, I am very happy. We have been praying. Both Christians and Muslims have been praying because the country has been so polarised as the fabrics of our nation was eaten by tribalism and religion. \n“So, I am very happy that the president is back and the president should listen to his doctors and continue to take his medication. \n“He should work less and put more effort on the economic team so that the economic team will be able to address the issue of the Nigerian economy. This is very important to the Nigerian people and I guess; if the Nigerian economy is good, the president himself will also be happy.” \nKalu also commiserated with the families of Gen. Adeyinka Adebayo, former governor of the Old Western Region and Brig-Gen. Samuel Ogbemudia, former governor of the defunct Bendel State, who passed on recently. \nHe said: “Both men were great statesmen. Gen. Adebayo is my colleague’s father, Niyi Adebayo and may his soul rest in peace. Gen. Ogbemudia was a good general. I don’t know why these two generals should be buried at the same time because Nigeria needs them more now for their experience and what we are going through. \n“I believe it is God’s time and nobody can stop God’s own time. So, I send my condolences to the families, especially to Niyi Adebayo.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T06:55:57.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
