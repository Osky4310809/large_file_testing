I’m sure you’re going to go off and have the fairytale ending you’ve always wanted and I wish that for you.\" Lockie with ex-girlfriend Danielle (Photo: Rex) Lockie with Danielle in a TOWIE scene (Photo: ITV) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:09:30.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
