Erik Nowak has already returned from the Middle East. \nImogen addresses the assembly, unaware that her father is sneaking up behind her. She turns, and gives a cry of delight. \n“Daddy!” \nThere are tears of joy, as the audience bursts into ecstatic applause. Somehow, Mom and Dad kept the secret. \n“I really wasn’t sure we pulled it off until right then,” Capt. Nowak says. “But listening to her speak, I realized she had no idea.” \n“They have an incredible father-daughter bond, and they’ve had it since day one,” adds her mother, Krista Nowak.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:52:03.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
