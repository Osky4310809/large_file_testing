I'm not the first but there are more than before. I'm very happy for everyone to be in the same race as me, even if they copy every single thing I've done. In a 100m sprint to get a No1 album I just know I'm going to win. I don't care who's doing what. I just know I'm going to win. I'm going to make sure I come first.\"\nWith that said, there's one person the songwriter is coming for… Adele : \n\"Adele is the one person who's sold more records than me in the past ten years. She's the only person I need to sell more records than. That's a big fucking feat because her last album sold 20 million. But if I don't set her as the benchmark then I'm selling myself short. I'm not in competition [creatively] because we all sit in our own lanes, but once the creative product is out there is a race to the finish line.\"\nBut what about his bestie Taylor Swift ??\nExplaining his similarities to the 27-year-old pop star, Sheeran shares:\n\"There's an underdog element to it. Taylor was never the popular kid in school. I was never the popular kid in school. Then you get to the point when you become the most popular kid in school – and we both take it a bit too far. She wants to be the biggest female artist in the world and I want to be the biggest male artist in the world. It also comes from always being told that you can't do something and being like, ‘Fuck you. I can.'\"\nThey certainly aren't the underdogs anymore!!\nRelated: Ed Is A TERRIBLE Date! \nP.S. Ed has a big eff you to whoever has made fun of his red hair:\n\"There's always a stigma with ginger people, and I was definitely considered unattractive when I was younger, but now I'm on the fucking cover of GQ !\"\nSnap snap !\n[ Image via British GQ /ATP/ WENN . ] \nTags: adele , bestiez , ed sheeran , gq , music minute , taylor swift", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T02:18:39.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
