After Betis scored, the ball movement became too slow and it took Zidane too much time to refresh the team with bench options. When he did, they worked out. \nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10 = best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating) \nGK Keylor Navas, 3 -- Two huge mistakes by the Costa Rica international in the first half gave his team a huge scare that took them off the match and gifted Betis their first goal. His final save, simply phenomenal, can't hide the fact that his confidence is at a historical low. \nDF Daniel Carvajal, 6 -- Out of position for Betis' first goal, his energy was there for most of the match, but his positioning and his passing were slightly off. Betis' Riza Durmisi gave him plenty of work. \nDF Nacho Fernandez, 8 -- Has become Zidane's first option off the bench pretty much for any position in the back four, and deservedly so. \nDF Sergio Ramos, 8 -- As the media runs out of hyperboles to describe his scoring form, Ramos not only won the match for his team, but also had the tact to dedicate his goal to Navas. His position as skipper and his leadership in the squad can't be questioned at this point. \nDF Marcelo, 7 -- Persistent and tireless, he found Cristiano Ronaldo for the first goal, but lacked accuracy in most of his crosses. More heated than usual, got into a couple of unnecessary incidents with Betis players. \nMF James Rodriguez, 6 -- Needs to get in better match shape. His passing and movement were good during a decent spell of the first half, but then lost importance as Betis increased the pressure. Unusually hesitant to take shots, when that is one of his best skills. \nMF Luka Modric, 5 -- More running than thinking from the Croatian on Sunday, when he should have been one of the key midfield members to direct Real Madrid's offence. His will was there, but his performance wasn't anywhere close to his usual high standards. Keylor Navas' confidence is at an all-time low during his tenure at the Santiago Bernabeu. \nMF Toni Kroos, 7 -- In a pure central midfield position, Kroos started most of the offensive movements and dared to dribble and take the ball forward. Tired towards the end. \nMF Isco Alarcon, 6 -- As with James, while Isco's energy lasted he gave Betis plenty to deal with. He linked up well with Marcelo and Ronaldo on a few occasions. Nevertheless, he lacked consistency and disappeared for some spells. \nFW Cristiano Ronaldo, 7 -- Took his goal coolly and enjoyed a few other chances playing as a centre-forward. His participation in build-up plays, more accurate in the last few matches, regressed against Betis. \nFW Alvaro Morata, 6 -- Key in distracting two defenders in Ronaldo's goal, he spent much less time in Betis' box than he should have. Morata excels with space, and the visitors' intelligent defence did not give him the type of match he prefers. \nSubstitutes \nMF Lucas Vazquez, 6 -- Replaced James after 69 minutes. Always resourceful, his presence gave Real Madrid width and speed on the right. \nFW Karim Benzema, 6 -- Replaced Morata after 71 minutes. Participated well in a few offensive moves. \nDF Marco Asensio, NR -- Replaced Isco after 79 minutes. \nEduardo is one of ESPN FC's Real Madrid bloggers and has been a socio since 1995.
