Leonard went back to the locker room and wasn’t seen on the bench as the Spurs fell 102-92 on Thursday.\nKawhi Leonard took a shot to the head but the team says he's fine.\n— Michael C. Wright (@mikecwright) March 10, 2017 It isn’t clear when Leonard was hit in the head or whether he had to go through concussion protocol. He finished the game with 26 minutes played while tallying 19 points, two rebounds and two assists.\nLeonard has played in 57 of the team’s 63 games this season. He’s averaging 26 points, six rebounds and about three assists, and his recent performance leading San Antonio back against James Harden’s Rockets pushed the MVP award narrative into his favor. Still, after Leonard rested in the Spurs’ last game against the Kings , and this lackluster, shortened performance on Thursday, any momentum he had slowed down drastically.\nHopefully, Leonard won’t miss time with his injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T06:05:25.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
