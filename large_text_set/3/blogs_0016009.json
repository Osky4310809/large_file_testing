However, our European spies have come across a mule parked at a petrol station during winter testing, and wasted no time in providing us with the closest look yet at the next Japanese performance hero. \nAlthough the photos don’t show many new details at first glance, there are a few things that can be gleaned upon closer inspection. The front end is clearly inspired by the FT-1 concept from Detroit 2014, with rounded headlights, a protruding F1-style nosecone and triple air intakes in the bumper. \nThe front shot reveals blanking plates over the outer air intakes, the left side sporting a tow eye and the right one hiding what appears to be a radar sensor for an active cruise control system. Although there are lines on the bonnet that look like typical shutlines, the real thing appears to be a clamshell unit à la the BMW Z3. \nAlong the sides, the 17-inch BMW alloy wheels hide massive brakes, with the front ones sporting four-piston callipers. There’s also a wraparound front windscreen design that extends to the side windows, while prominent rear haunches can be found over the rear wheels. \nMoving rearward, the Supra features a hatch instead of a conventional bootlid, and the slim tail lights are reminiscent of both the FT-1 and the beloved Mk4 Supra . At the bottom are twin exhaust exits and cutouts for what looks like a centrally-mounted fog light – again, like the FT-1. \nWe’ve seen the interior before, and it appears to have been carried over wholesale from the BMW Z5 it is based on, with the three-spoke steering wheel, freestanding centre display, semi-virtual instrument cluster and even the climate control switchgear all taken from the BMW parts bin. Perhaps the production car will have a more unique interior design. \nUnder the bonnet, the Supra is expected to be powered by a range of BMW-derived inline four- and six-cylinder turbocharged petrol engines, with the most powerful hybrid model getting capacitors and four-wheel drive. The cars are also tipped to benefit from BMW’s expertise in carbon fibre construction, joining the likes of the BMW i3, i8 and G12 7 Series in incorporating the material in their architecture.
