Democrats are unified in their opposition to the bill. \nA senior White House official told Reuters news agency that Thursday's vote was delayed so it would not be held in the middle of the night. The official said the vote will be held on Friday morning. \nThe Republican legislation would halt Obama's tax penalties against people who do not buy coverage and cut the federal-state Medicaid programme for low earners, which the Obama statute had expanded. \nIt would provide tax credits to help people pay medical bills, though generally skimpier than Obama's statute provides. \nIt also would allow insurers to charge older Americans more and repeal tax boosts the law imposed on high-income people and health industry companies. \nThe measure would also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, another stumbling block for Republican moderates.
