Our sister site, PC Mag , has been covering the highlights from the show. And one of the more exciting developments we’ve seen this year is the conclusion of a trend we saw in 2016: gaming laptops that can finally go toe-to-toe with their full-sized counterparts.\nVeteran notebook manufacturers like Dell and its subsidiary, Alienware, are updating their product lines. Both will see Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, which promise improved performance and power efficiency, as well Nvidia’s 10-series video cards.\nDell’s Inspiron line promises high-end performance at a reasonable price. The 15-inch Inspiron 7000 will be available for order starting at $799 on January 5. It’ll come with a seventh-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, GTX 1050 or 1050 Ti GPU, a 512GB M.2 SSD or a 1TB HDD, and up to 32GB of RAM.\nOn the other side of things is Alienware, Dell’s huskier, more powerful cousin. Each of Alienware’s laptops is getting the Kaby Lake bump even the svelte, 13-inch ultraportable. The Alienware 13 is roughly comparable to the Inspiron 7000, with similar RAM, GPU, and processor configurations, but with a slightly lower starting screen resolution (1366 by 768 vs full 1080p), though you can opt for either full HD or a 2560 by 1440 screen when you order. Orders start at $999 on January 5.\nThe next two systems, the Alienware 15 and 17 are true desktop replacements. The former comes in at almost 8lbs. This beast supports comes with lots of options including top-end, unlocked i7 processors, Nvidia’s GTX 1070, 32GB of ram and up to two SSDs and an HDD. The Alienware 15 will also be available for order on Jan 5 and starts at $1199.\nFinally, we have the 17.3-inch monster. It can sport two core i7s, up to a GTX 1080, and even Tobii eye-tracking, so you can control your games with naught but a glance. The Alienware 17 comes in at a scale-tipping 10 lbs and starts at $1349. Orders start (you guessed it) January 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:36:03.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
