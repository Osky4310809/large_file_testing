It would also keep the dream alive of a fairytale finish to a special campaign.

It will be very tough for our fans and for the people who love Tottenham. \n“I think it is an energy or an extra that we feel, the players feel, in the way that we are playing this season at White Hart Lane. \n“You can see that we are warriors. You defend your home, your house, and that is the what the fans see too – how the players love to fight in every game and it’s the connection and the energy and the feeling that we have got in every game at White Hart Lane is amazing.” Pochettino's men have found their form (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nAfter a nightmare spell during which the club crashed out of the Champions League and managed to win just one of ten games in all competitions, Spurs are on the way back up. \nIncluding their FA Cup third round win over Aston Villa, they have now won nine of their last ten with their last seven coming on the bounce. \nStriker Harry Kane hit a hat-trick in the 4-0 win over West Brom last weekend while Dele Alli has netted seven times in his last six. \nThe Spurs defence remains the strongest in the Premier League so far.

He said: “We are very young. The squad is very young. I am very young still. \n“It is true that four years ago I was younger but, you know, I am here to try and help the club achieve big things. \n“Today we are in a process that, when you built a stadium, always it’s difficult. But we have unbelievable players, a unbelievable squad. Players that feel Tottenham. \n“They need big patience. But it’s true that our objective is to win titles and to put the club on the level that it deserves.” Guardiola and his Manchester City side are next up (Photo: REUTERS) Read More Transfer news LIVE: All the latest from the January window \nPep Guardiola suffered his heaviest-ever league defeat as a manager when his side were slaughtered 4-0 at Everton last Sunday. \nYet for all the criticism that the Spaniard has received, he is still on a run of five wins from his last seven, including the FA Cup. \nPochettino went on: “To me it means nothing for City to lose against Everton. It does not change my admiration or what are my thoughts about him. \n“He needs time, he’s in a position where they can still win titles. He has shown enough quality before in Barcelona and in Bayern Munich. The important thing is that you cannot win after a few months titles. You need to wait until the end - and you can be sure that Guardiola will fight with Manchester City until the end for big things.” poll loading What's your prediction for this one? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T01:00:15.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
