Or at least this SAHM — I wont speak for all of them because the last thing you should ever do is assume anything about sleep-deprived, coffee-fueled women who deal with toddlers all day (trust me on this one). \nI’ve been running this (shit)show for the last six years, and I’ve gotten my fair share of curious/judgmental/nosy questions along the way, so let’s just clear up a few of my personal favorites real quick: \n“Don’t you get bored?” Umm duh. \n“What are you going to do when the kids are all in school?” I’m not 100% sure what direction my life will be in next Thursday let alone five years from now. \n“Three kids under 6?! You must have your hands full.” Yes, I do but I always make sure one hand is empty by 7 p.m. so I can put a beer in it (priorities). \n“I could never stay home all day like that. I’d go crazy.” Ya know what would make me crazy? Working a 40-hour a week job and still only being able to afford the $8 bottle of wine at Rite Aid after I pay for daycare for three kids, that’s what. Katy Jackman Me, hiding from my kids and your unwanted judgement \nSo here’s the breakdown for all you nosy-ass people out there who are still reading this. (Kidding. Please keep reading.

Please don’t take this as a “My day is so much harder than yours” diatribe, because at the end of the day, we’re all just trying not to raise asshole children while staring at a clock waiting for our version of Whine Thirty. \nIf you do more than me in a day, you are superhuman. If you do less and your kids are happy, tell me all your secrets. If you’re silently judging me for giving my kids Pop-Tarts, don’t bother because the dog eats 85% of them anyway. If you’re surprised by what you just read because you thought I had my shit together and my life was magical, I apologize for ever giving you that impression. \nAnd finally, and most importantly, if you read that and felt exhausted and pity me, turn it into something tangible and send me free wine and cheese.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T10:16:57.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
