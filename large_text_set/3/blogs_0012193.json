What is Tillerson facing in Asia? \nAsked if the possibility for military action existed, he said: \"Certainly we do not want to, for things to get to military conflict.\" \nBut he added: \"If they elevate the threat of their weapons programme to a level that we believe requires action, then, that option's on the table.\" \nHe also called on China to fully implement sanctions imposed by the UN in response to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests. \n\"I don't believe we have ever fully achieved the maximum level of action that can be taken under the UN Security Council resolution with full participation of all countries,\" he said. \nThe US accuses China, North Korea's main ally, of not doing enough to rein it in. But Beijing remains wary of any action that could destabilise the North Korean regime and potentially create chaos on its border.
