The last estimate I saw showed that there were 700,000 houses with extant permissions but on which construction has not yet started ( “Plans to open up the green belt have to be just the start” , Comment). \nDevelopers are not charitable institutions; their prime responsibility is to their profits and shareholders, hence they drip-feed developments to suit them. This means that councils that demonstrated they had the requisite five-year supply of housing land when they adopted their development plans, say two or three years ago, can no longer prove that because of the way it is calculated. This carries significant weight, particularly if they refuse permission and an appeal follows, which is likely to be allowed. So we have the ridiculous situation where the supply of planning permissions is increasing but the supply of new houses is not. \nThe other problem, and one that relates particularly to affordable housing, is that developers are only too keen to agree to build, say, 30% affordable housing in order to get planning permission. You would assume that they would build this into how much they pay for the land, but they will often return later, plead “non-viability” and seek to reduce the figure, knowing the cards are stacked against a council that resists. \nDespite the latest rhetoric from the government, it doesn’t matter if affordable housing is to buy or rent if the houses aren’t being built in the first place and if the proportion of affordable units is so vulnerable. \nAs the government is clearly reluctant to put pressure on developers to speed up, an option would be to enable councils or housing associations to acquire land – possibly compulsorily – and build houses. Unfortunately, this would require legislation, which is even more unlikely under this government. Norman Jowett \nNottingham \nRowan Moore made clear a point that all too rarely features in any discussion of the housing shortage: it will never be resolved by private developers. As he puts it: “It is not in their interests to do so.” They are in business for the quite legitimate purpose of making a profit, not to solve social problems. They do their utmost to provide as little affordable housing as possible and the last thing they want (along with nearly all existing homeowners) is to create a situation that leads to a drop in prices. \nPublic investment is the only way to ensure that people on low incomes can have a decent roof over their heads and enough left over to put food on the table. Les Masters Weston-super-Mare \nAs ever, the Tories do not try to address the real problem, so their plans to help renters will do nothing to deal with the housing crisis in Britain ( “Tories break with Thatcher homes policy to back renters” , News). \nThere are plenty of good landlords, but even the bad ones didn’t create the problem: successive governments did that over decades, allowing cheap money from around the world to be used to buy the homes British people need, many of which remain as empty cashboxes in the sky. \nOnly a serious attack on the ludicrous house price situation and stricter rules on empty flats and foreign ownership will deal with the issue. Start by repealing right to buy and all variants, including laws forcing housing associations to sell their best properties to their richest tenants and help-to-buy schemes that only prop up prices; withdraw all tax deductibles allowed for multiple-property owners; double council tax on all homes empty for more than 12 months and continue doubling for every subsequent year; if a flat remains empty for more than five years, allow councils to compulsorily purchase them. Oh, and stop all sales to non-residents. David Reed", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:51:05.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
