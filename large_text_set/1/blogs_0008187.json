However, he made things even more cringeworthy by brainstorming an alternate book title: How to Date a Black Woman: A Practical Guide [for] Asian Men.\n\"Same thing,\" he said after picturing how black women would respond to Asian men. \"'You like Asian men?'\" Harvey asked hypothetically before bringing on an insulting stereotype. \"'I donâ€™t even like Chinese food.'\"\nJudging from the fact that Harvey proceeded to double over with laughter at his own remarks for the final 10 seconds of the video, he didn't appear to see any issue with his words.\nLater on during the show's Q&A segment, an Asian woman from the Philippines stood up in the audience to offer the comedian advice on the 2017 Miss Universe pageant.\nAfter a long pause and a lot of laughter, Harvey looked at her and playfully said, \"I'm sorry.\"\nIt's 2017, Steve.
