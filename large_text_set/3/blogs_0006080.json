For starters, the airline provides women with luggage and taxi assistance and for appetisers, the airline provides women with what they need the most and that’s a choice, even if it is as small as where they would be sitting on the flight. \nMoreover, the airline’s staff would be holding #VistaraWomanFlyer placards to assist women travellers with any other assistance that they might need. With these efforts, the airline has given a reason to women across India to celebrate this day and take that solo trip they have long been planning. \nAll that a female traveller has to do is to book the ticket through ‘Manage my Booking’ feature and if you want to skip that also, the staff has you covered. They will only provide aisle or window seats to women travelling alone. And no, that is not all. Following Air India’s suit, Vistara’s inaugural flight from Mumbai to Amritsar will be operated by an all women crew. Vistara is a domestic carrier which was launched in 2013. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nOn March 5, Air India claimed to have carried out the world’s first passenger journey around the world with an all-women crew on a New Delhi to San Francisco flight and back again.
