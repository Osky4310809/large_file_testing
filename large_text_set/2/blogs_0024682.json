In one particular lyric, he says “Happiness (or haengbok in Korean) walk in,” which sounds oddly similar to Burger King when rapped quickly in a certain rhythm. Certain typography used in the video also placed emphasis on “king.” \nThe track was co-produced with Prime Boi, and encourages the youth to just enjoy life. His agency Brand New Music explained it was the rapper’s first collaboration with a brand, and it will be used in future Burger King campaigns. \nGive the song a listen below!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:22:26.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
