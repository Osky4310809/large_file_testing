In fact, the lucrative market for parmesan in particular is open knowledge in its home region of Emilia-Romagna. At least $7 million in cheese has been stolen in the last two years alone, according to CBS News and Italy’s parmesan consortium. (Because the large wheels must be aged for a year and are often stored in rural environments, the warehouses can become targets for a theft.)\nItalian news outlets report that the team of organized criminals apprehended in this new sting were responsible for stealing an alleged 16,000 bottles of wine—worth about $140,000—and 168 wheels of parmesan, adding up to about $110,000.\nIt remains unclear who, ultimately, got to enjoy the delicious score.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:11:09.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
