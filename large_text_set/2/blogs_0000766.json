That’s enough to give it almost 2 million more likes than the image that previously held the record, a shot of actress-turned-popstar Selena Gomez drinking from a straw, which was uploaded last year. A photo posted by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Jun 25, 2016 at 2:03pm PDT \nDespite being bumped by Bey’s baby bump, Gomez still has Instagram’s most followers (aside from the photo-sharing site’s own account), with 108 million to Beyoncé’s 93.1 million. \nIn addition to breaking Instagram records, Beyoncé also made serious noise over on Twitter. According to Twitter’s stat-tracking division, the singer’s pregnancy announcement received half a million tweets in 45 minutes. Half a million Tweets about @Beyonce 's surprise #twins announcement. It's been 45 minutes. (Spiked at 17k Tweets per min.) 🍼🍼 \n— Twitter Data (@TwitterData) February 1, 2017 \nBut that wasn’t enough for Bey and the twins to break any Twitter records. \nTo give you some context, Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration generated about 58,000 tweets per minute at its peak. Beyoncé’s announcement spiked at 17,000 tweets per minute. 12 million Tweets have been sent so far today related to the #Inauguration . Peaked at 58k Tweets sent per minute at 12:02pm EST. pic.twitter.com/bmqg1jdU8w \n— Twitter Data (@TwitterData) January 20, 2017 \nBeyoncé followed up the record-breaking post by sharing many more maternity photos on her website .
