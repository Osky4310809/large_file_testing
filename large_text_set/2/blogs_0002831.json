Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating) \nGK Luis Robles, 5 -- Had very little to do in his 45 minutes on the field, though he was called upon to punch out a driven cross. Played the ball into the path of a Jamaican player, which luckily did not result in a goal. \nDF Graham Zusi, 6 -- Played well when pushed up and on the ball, giving the U.S. a smart option to release pressure. Struggled with one-on-one defending and beaten with speed more than once. \nDF Steve Birnbaum, 6.5 -- Guilty of doing very little wrong in a 90 minute performance. Made a handful of strong defensive interventions. \nDF Walker Zimmerman, 8 -- Excellent all night. Composed and aggressive when necessary. Passed well out of the back and showed bravery by pushing the space in front of him when available. \nDF Jorge Villafana, 6.5 -- Solid performance that will put him in good stead moving forward. Rarely out of position. Worked well up the left in attack. \nMF Dax McCarty, 6.5 -- Broke up play from his holding-midfield position well. Strong passing for most of the night, but did turn the ball over uncharacteristically to start the second half. Played a great pass to set up the goal. \nMF Chris Pontius, 5 -- Popped up only sporadically on the right side of the midfield. Presented with a good chance to get a head on a cross in the first half and whiffed. Created a few good moments by pushing to the end line. \nMF Benny Feilhaber, 7.5 -- A creative force in the middle of the field during the entirety of his 60 minutes, but really showed his quality by setting up the Jordan Morris goal. Jordan Morris spurned a good first-half chance, but buried the one that mattered in the second half to give the U.S. the win. \nMF Sebastian Lletget, 6 -- Provided some good combination play with Villafana on the left side in the first half. Hit a few dangerous crosses and showed his versatility. \nFW Jordan Morris, 7 -- Did what forwards are supposed to do by scoring in the 59th minute. Missed a good chance when played in against Jamaica keeper Andre Blake in the first half. Covered lots of ground. \nFW Juan Agudelo, 6.5 -- Set the tone for the U.S. with effective pressing early. Excellent workrate, but couldn't find the ball in dangerous areas. Faded in the second half. \nSubstitutes \nGK David Bingham, 6 -- Touched the ball just twice in a very quiet second half. \nMF Michael Bradley, NR -- Came in just after the U.S. goal and brought composure in central midfield. Sat deep and played smart passes. \nMF Darlington Nagbe, NR -- Good with his touch and passing, misplaced a few passes. Did the smart thing to help close out the game. \nDF Brad Evans, NR -- Good on the ball. Tested by Sounders teammate O'Neil Fisher more than once and coped well. \nMF Alejandro Bedoya -- Added energy and ground coverage in central midfield in a cameo appearance. Missed just one pass. \nDF DaMarcus Beasley, NR -- Overlapped very early in his appearance at left-back with his trademark speed but touch let him down. \nJason Davis covers Major League Soccer and the United States national team for ESPN FC.
