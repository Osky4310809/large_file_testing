(Credit: NYPD) \n\"Hate crimes are up in this city. They're driven primarily by anti-Semitic hate crimes,\" NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said in a news conference at Astoria's 114th Precinct on Wednesday. \nBoyce also noted there were recently four bomb threats made to \"Jewish locations.\" Of these, two were at Jewish community centers, one was at a museum and the fourth took place last week at the headquarters of the Anti-Defamation League in Midtown Manhattan. \nThe NYPD did not provide details on where and when the others took place, or if they include an incident Monday in which a man called in a bomb threat at the Jewish Community Center of Staten Island. \nIt wasn't clear if these four incidents are included in the statistics for the period ending Feb. 26, but they were all deemed unfounded, according to officials, who believe they're related to similar threats at Jewish sites across the nation. \n\"We believe that's part of a nationwide pattern,\" Boyce said. \"We've spoken with the FBI in regards to specific verbiage used in each one.\" \nNYPD officials say police officers are making additional visits to Jewish community centers and places of worship in response to the jump in anti-Semitic crimes. \n\"We want to provide a sense of safety,\" NYPD Chief of Department Carlos Gomez said. \"We're going to continue this and actually increase it as we near Passover.\" \nMayor Bill de Blasio called the threats \"very troubling and unsettling,\" and said they're taking place \"against a backdrop of growing numbers of anti-Semitic instances all over this country and all over this world.\" \n\"I want everyone who is concerned to know that NYPD is highly focused, as it always is, on protecting all communities,\" he said. \nLast year, the NYPD reported a spike in the number of hate crimes in the city following the presidential election , though officials told reporters earlier this month that the rise appeared to leveling off. \nThe most recent statistics come as overall crime in the city was down 9.7 percent during the month of February compared to 2016, officials said. \nBut murders were up during that period, from 20 this year to 18 a year ago, according to police statistics. \nThere were also 40 shooting incidents last month — in what officials say is the lowest number for any month on record — compared to 62 during February 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T10:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T06:31:21.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
