In this section: Ways to pay for your qualification and other support How much will it cost? \nWe believe cost shouldn’t be a barrier to achieving your potential. That’s why we work hard to keep the cost of study as low as possible and have a wide range of flexible ways to pay to help spread, or even reduce, the cost. Fees are paid on a module-by-module basis – you won't have to pay for the whole of your qualification up front. A qualification comprises a series of modules, each with an individual fee. Added together, they give you the total cost. If (like most OU students) you study part time at a rate of 60 credits a year, you'll take six years to complete an honours degree. Our current fee for 60 credits is £2,786*. Our current fee is £5,572* – based on 120 credits of study – which is equivalent to a year's full-time study. The total cost of your qualification starts from £16,716* based on our current fees. \n*The fee information provided here is valid for modules starting before 31 July 2017. Fees normally increase annually in line with inflation and the University's strategic approach to fees. Additional costs Study costs \nThere may be extra costs on top of the tuition fee, such as a laptop, travel to tutorials, set books and internet access. If you're on a low income you might be eligible for help with some of these costs after you register. Ways to pay for your qualification and other support \nWe know there’s a lot to think about when choosing to study, not least how you can pay. That’s why we offer a wide range of flexible payment and funding options to help make study more affordable. Options include Part-Time Tuition Fee Loans (also known as student loans), monthly payment plans and employer sponsorship. \nWe’re confident we can help you find an option that’s right for you. Just answer these simple questions to find out more about the options available to you for courses starting before 31 July 2017. \nTo find out what funding options are available you need to tell us: \nhow many credits you want to study \nif you already hold a degree \nif your household is in receipt of benefits \nabout your household income \nif you are a member of the British forces overseas How many credits are you planning to study per year? \nCredits You will need [xxx] credits to complete this qualification. 30 credits per year means you will study 8 - 9 hours per week 60 credits per year means you will study 16 - 18 hours per week Do you already hold a degree?
