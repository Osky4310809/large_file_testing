Cross Co. has supplied ceremonial pens for several presidents, beginning with the Ford administration, including former President Barack Obama. Trump’s are different in that he prefers gold-plated pens over the chrome-plated ones Obama used.

Just having a president using our pens is pretty cool,” Boss said. “I’d much rather him using our pens than somebody else’s.” Advertisement - story continues below", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:29:34.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
