After all, we believe in connecting the dots.”\nHe then tossed out a sweet offer — hosting an ice-cream social at the White House for Spicer and the press corps.\n“What do you say? We’ll make sure there’s plenty of all your favorite flavors,” Fischer said.\nA Dippin’ Dots spokeswoman said it has yet to hear back from the White House and Spicer.\nShe also said the brand no longer dubs itself “Ice Cream of the Future” but now uses the slogan “Taste the Fun.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:27:59.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
