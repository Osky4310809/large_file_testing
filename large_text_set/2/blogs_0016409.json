Clinton also drew applause from the crowd as she was spotted inside the theater.  \n\nClinton has been spotted at numerous events since her failed presidential bid in November.  She recently attended New York Fashion Week where she met with longtime friend Anna Winter for a USPS Oscar de la Renta Forever Stamp unveiling.  \n\nClinton used the opportunity to comment on the Dominian-born designers legacy, as well as the current administration’s stance on immigration.  \n“Let there be many, many more immigrants with the love of America that Oscar de la Renta exemplified every single day,” Clinton said. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:01:53.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
