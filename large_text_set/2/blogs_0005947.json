Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says his players fully deserved their 3-1 win over Arsenal as they stretched their lead at the top to 12 points \n\"They won comfortably today. Chelsea play a pragmatic style of football, where they're always in the game and the two central midfielders make sure they're never exposed. \n\"Because of the types of players they have, they know they have someone who can do something special. All-round they are a very solid unit full of very special players that don't have to be at their best to win games.\" \nArsenal may have complaints about Marcos Alonso's opener, which came when he clattered Hector Bellerin. But the visitors could do nothing about the second as Hazard picked the ball up in the centre circle, evaded Laurent Koscielny and brushed off Francis Coquelin before drilling in by Petr Cech. \nCesc Fabregas netted a third, as Chelsea ruthlessly punished Arsenal, who enjoyed 59 per cent possession and did create chances at Stamford Bridge. \n\"Chelsea don't have to dominate the ball to win football matches,\" said Souness. Arsene Wenger insists that Marcos Alonso's opener was a foul \n\"They went to Liverpool in midweek and didn't have much of the ball, but they didn't get beat. That's what champions do. They grind out a result. You win games when players like Costa aren't at their best. Chelsea are a very dangerous team. \n\"When you win games and you're not bang at it - that makes a threat.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T20:16:26.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
