While Bomb Shelter’s work on the principle of W=Nb+Nd (Walls = No Bomb + No Death) Zombie Shelter’s work on a slightly different method, that method being W+N+F=Nu+Nd (Wall + Napalm + Fire = No Undead = No Death, that is if you are far enough from the napalm. Good luck with that in a small ZS). edit Shelter Types \nThe basic ZS is a small 5m x 5m x 5m cube constructed of pure unadalterated WIN , reinforced by a solid 10m deep foundation made out of a single piece of diamond. The cube is surrounded by a lake of napalm that, when required, can be lit on fire to prevent the legions of the damned from eating your brain. Other shelters range from the massive zombie-proof mansions of southern Switzerland to the Neverland Ranch theme park created by legendary Zombie Hunter Ozzy Osbourne . Whatever your budget, there is always an affordable and effective Zombie-Proof Shelter available. edit Shelter Construction \nThis guide will focus on the method of Zombie-Proof Shelter construction. If all the steps are followed, a shelter with a high level of Zombie-Repulsion and Disattraction should be easily attained. Before the exact steps are discussed, a list of required materials will be given: 6 sheets of high quality titanium , at least 40cm thick and 5m x 5m in dimension. 3 sheets of diamond, 50cm x 50cm in dimension and 10cm thick. 1 bulkhead door, made out of titanium. 1 10m x 10m x 10m cube of solid diamond. 1000+ liters of napalm . Cement . Titanium mesh. Automated flamethrower turret. A good point of reference for the design of said turret would be Red Alert 1. Condoms, always carry protection, no matter what the emergency. Duct Tape edit Steps Dig a large hole in the ground, approximately 11m deep by 11m wide. Place your diamond cube in the hole, filling the gaps around the side with high quality cement and strong titanium mesh. Rivet one of the titanium sheets down to the center of the diamond cube; this will act as the floor. Take 4 of the remaining titanium sheets; with 3 of them you need to install the sheets of diamond, which will act as windows. In the 4th, you will need to install the bulkhead. Attach the 4 titanium sheets mentioned above to the floor; they will act as walls. To the one remaining sheet, attach the flamethrower turret. Attach the remaining sheet to the top of the shelter; it will act as a roof. Attach the LED Flood Lights to the four corners of the roof; they will act as a deterrent to any zombie that survives the moat of fire. Dig out a deep trench surrounding your impenetrable zombie cube and fill it with the napalm; if you need more napalm, now would be the time to acquire it. Bring books, pot, condoms, & women for you WILL get bored! \nNote : Condoms have various uses such as for storing ammunition, food, cool hats, and it's main use of safe lewd pleasures. Bring as many as you can; same goes for women. edit Operation \nIt is fairly simple to operate your ZS, simply shut yourself in and hope for the best. The LED Flood Lights will emit light in a spectrum that zombies find repellent, and over a long length of time the Healing Magic Effect can occur. The napalm works on the principle of Z=F (Zombies = Flammable) and Fl+N+F=Pd (Flammable + Napalm + Fire = Permanent Death), which, in short, means that whenever a zombie is detected by the automated turret, it will fire into the napalm, igniting it and any zombies that happen to be nearby. It is HIGHLY recommended to bring 5 to 10 500. Napalm tanks for refill on the pools. These can be placed on the surface of the main underground shelter. \nIt is recommended that you stock your ZS with all the requirements, such as food, water and a large flat screen TV, with cable. As your stay can be long, it is suggested that large amounts of these items be stockpiled. edit Closing \nThose are the basic steps on how to create a single person ZS, for each additional person add double the materials. If you do not wish to create your own shelter, it is possible to purchase one from your local Sanitarium, or order one online from one of many retailers. edit Quotes “Yes, well we have been holed up here for the past 3 weeks, and so far nothing has gotten in, however we did find one critical flaw in the shelter after the first day... NAPALM DISAPPEARS WHEN IT IS BURNT. We felt all secure in the shelter, with the thought that we had napalm around us... but then the first wave of zombies came at us, we were a little scared as we were not sure of the shelters capabilities at that point.... but once the turret went into action.... The sky lit up and the air was filled with the smell of burning dead, all of us in the shelter rejoiced at the smell... But a few hours later we noticed the napalm moat was still burning, and was diminishing rapidly, and with no way to put out the blaze it was gone by the next morning, and aside from the loss of the primary defense system, the temperature inside the shelter got so high, that several of us died from heat stroke, and fearful of the thought of zombies in the shelter, we threw them outside quickly. But, aside from that massive design flaw, the shelter works extremely well, the titanium walls have yet to be breached and all though the turret is nearly out of fuel, much like the moat, it continues to set alight many waves of the undead. ” ~ Outbreak Survivor on Build-It-Yourself Zombie Shelter edit Levels of Outbreak \nThe official report outlines for classification levels of outbreak. They range in seriousness, location, and number of zombies involved. These levels are: Class One. Class One is the least serious outbreak. It usually takes place on a small area of the skin (near the groin), and involves no more than twenty-five zombie growths. It usually lasts no more than two weeks. The best way to defend against a class one outbreak is to stay calm, find a nearby comfortable area, and wait for the painkillers to kick in. Use appropriate salves to help reduce swelling. Class Two. Class Two outbreaks involve more than a hundred zombies, but may not last longer than a class one outbreak. The larger number of zombies may provoke a swifter response from the body's defense system. If you find yourself in the middle of a class two outbreak, it is advised that you leave the general area of infection alone until the infestation is over. Zombies are highly contagious and you may spread the infection to other areas of your body simply by touch. Class Three. Class Three is a very dangerous, very deadly outbreak. Zombies will number in the thousands and spread out from the groin over hundreds of square inches. In addition to the threat posed by the living dead, the mass chaos and breakdown of law and order caused by your scarred visage is likely to claim additional lives. It is recommended you not try to approach any girls during this time. Class Four. Class Four outbreaks involve total undead domination of the body. In this scenario, the undead outnumber the living by vast amounts. Governments break down and people are left to survive on their own. Billions die...or just turn into zombies. Class Five. If you are a human... You're probably the only one left. The only thing you can possibly do is wait it out. I hope you got a lot of food... You're gonna need it. If you have the opportunity, get a boat and get about a hundred meters off shore, and bring a fishing rod. if you manage to catch a fish, kill it and throw it out to sea. The smell of blood will attract all the zombies in the nearest 10 miles. And as we all know, zombies can't swim. So now you can have a good time laughing at them before you shoot yourself in the head and join the bastards. The smell of blood will attract even more zombies. A class five outbreak will only happen one time. Zombies win(except Chuck Norris). Class six. Face it dudes and dudeettes, you are fucked. The only way you can survive this is if you get to the ocean with a ship full of guns, ammo, explosives, food, and water. if you do survive this get on top of the ship and yell \"I FUCKING DID IT!!!\" Class X. In a situation such as this, the zombies have somehow adopted Chuck Norris as their king, and now live in a civilized, albeit bloody and barbaric new world. Humanity is inevitably doomed to extinction. Dont even bother trying to commit suicide because as soon as the infection escalates to this level, your head will instantly explode. edit Evil Geniuses \nThese super smart, super evil scientists spend their days in oversized laboratories, trying to create some kind of super evil thing. Somehow, they are never able to complete the thing, and in the process of attempting to create the thing, some kind of evil toxin, fungus, or other substance which can cause people to mutate into zombies is released. Normally, the zombies are coworkers of the evil geniuses, and are trapped in the secret underground facility until some moron tries to find out what happened down there. They unwittingly release the zombies, and become one in the process. The zombies then go on a rampage against the unsuspecting citizens of a conveniently placed nearby town. edit Government Labs \nSimilar to evil geniuses, government labs are where some military-designed virus escapes and everything goes horribly wrong. Usually the escaping virus will kill everybody in the lab in very bloody and painful ways before escaping to kill everybody on the outside world. The government will always deny this and will attempt to cover the incident up and quarantine infected areas. The quarantines always fail. See effects of evil geniuses. edit Hospitals \nHospitals are world renowned for their ability to save lives, and charge way too much to do it. But sometimes, things go horribly wrong. Sometimes the doctors will give a patient the wrong dose of chemotherapy, which will cause it to go away for a week or so. The person goes home seemingly healed...then the cancer comes back, mutated to cause zombification. When this happens, the closest people to the new zombie will be eaten in their sleep, and they will become zombies in a matter of seconds due to the mutated zombie cancer. Thus the outbreak begins. edit Voodoo Curse \nSome curse used by a powerful shaman causes a recently-dead person to rise from there grave and do the bidding of said shaman. Zombie powder is used to bring the dead back to life at the zombification ritual. There is usually very few of these zombies in an outbreak, as it would take forever for a shaman to create so many zombies. edit Indian Graveyards \nIndians (Native Americans for the slaves of political correctness) have been known to place curses to deter desecration of their burial grounds. When modern people decide to build housing developments on top of these places, the curse is activated. The magic of the curse reanimates the skeletal remains. While these zombies are scary as hell, and roam around causing massive emotional scars, they are actually harmless, because their job is actually to get the people off the land and not to eat brains. Once this task is completed, they will return to their graves. edit Masturbation \nFluids emitted during masturbation can, when left alone long enough, ferment into a very simple zombie-like organism. It will latch onto the face and suck out the soul, causing the victim to become a zombie. The best way to avoid this situation is to catch any fluids on your shirt, on the bed, in the sink, in a condom, on a beloved pet, or other place, and dispose of properly (for example, incineration). Masturbating into a dirty tube sock also works remarkably well. edit The Solanum Virus \nA virus that causes vital organs to shut down and causes the frontal lobe of the brain to disintegrate. The only known remedy short of death is holding your hand under a pump whilst shouting \"WATER!\", or the consumption of copious amounts of baked beans. All wild animals detect Solanum so if in doubt, offer your vital limbs to tigers or lions or cheetahs. If they flee, you're a zombie or something. edit Experimental Chemicals or Medicines \nBe wary whenever your town is about to be the first to test some variety of chemical or medicine. There is a very high chance that it will all go horribly wrong, resulting in a zombie epidemic. It is advised that if moving chemicals to not go past the local graveyard, as it is guaranteed you will hit a well placed bump and drop your cargo into said graveyard. edit Vengeance \nSometimes if a bunch of really evil guys get killed, most notably Totenkopf SS troops or Knights Templar who believe the Church's lies about themselves and assume they're evil, they'll periodically come back to feast on the flesh of the living. Particularly dangerous, because they've got weapons (swords, spears, firearms) and may remember some vestige of the tactics they learnt when alive. edit The Venus Probe \nIt came back, the dead rose; as with \"Vengeance\" above, \"lack of an identifiable mechanism\" is distinct from \"Absolutely no reason whatsoever\" but about as much help. Be warned that said zombies that rise from this source could have unintended side-effects, such as: Climbing along the walls, jumping really high/far, running, wielding guns, talking, and vaulting over things. edit The Democrats \nEvery once in a while, America will make a mistake, and Democrats will find themselves in charge of the country. Through creatively named traditions of mental brainwashing, the Democrats will slowly, and intentionally, begin to lead the country to intense zombification. From their country-wide speeches, normal, everyday families will discover they'd rather eat their loved ones' brains than listen to the Democrats. The mental breakdown influenced by this behavior is contagious, as the aura of the Democrats is left on the victims, much like the smell of a skunk. From there, worldwide zombification ensues, until the world is consumed by the deadly disease. All except the Democrats, who will be hiding in an underground bunker, of course, those damn bastards, edit Absolutely no reason whatsoever \nOccasionally you will find that there really was no reason for the zombie outbreak. It just happened. In this instance, it is advised that you notice signs of the zombie outbreak, regardless of how 'dead' everyone seems to be normally. edit Zombie Cloud Hotspots \nZombie Clouds are typically attracted to hospitals, schools, research labs, graveyards, shopping malls, abandoned streets and run down buildings basically anywhere that is creepy and a good set for a film. It is therefore best to avoid these areas like the plague (pun intended), and if it is necessary to approach them do so only with a full compliment of equipment and preferably a Zombie Survival Group. \nAnswer the following question's to determine if an area is a Hotspot if you are unsure; Is it a popular place, regularly visited by the living? Does it have any connection with the dead? Is it in any way abandoned or run down? Can you hear the moaning of the zombies as they look for brains? Can you see any zombies as they look for brains? Does Michael Jackson hang out there? \nIf you answered 'Yes' to one or more of the above questions then it can be assumed it is a Zombie Hotspot and should therefore be avoided. If you happen to be caught in a Hotspot for any reason then follow the Suppression Techniques detailed below. edit Zombie Suppression Techniques \nThere are many ways to suppress different types of zombies. A common weakness to note is the head or brain area: without their heads, they're often powerless (just hope to God you're not in Brain Dead ). Some common Zombie Suppression Techniques are as follows: \nThe Blunt Object To The Face Technique or simply 'Face' method is particularly effective as a last resort and a popular Olympic sport. It involves a living person, one or more zombies and a blunt, preferably heavy, weapon. The basic idea is to approach an available zombie, carefully avoiding the freshly slaughtered ones (as a fall would mean certain death) at a run or fast walk, and swing the blunt object with force and speed into your target zombies head, preferably decapitating and rekilling it. Preferred weapons include the Maul, the Club, the Bat, the Crowbar ( For more information, see Half-Life ), the Steel Pipe, the Baneblade, Super Heavy Tank, or the fender off of a Chevelle. You can fend of zombies with the help of vibrating swords. Only should be used by male. \nThe Shotgun Technique is a very common and effective, if unimaginative, way of destroying zombies, especially in large Clouds. Its devastating impact on decaying tissue over short range and its large blast radius make/have made it an instant favorite among all zombie killing connoisseurs who fancy a mass redeath with maximum explosiveness. The standard Shotgun Technique involves standing still and facing the approaching horde of undead, as they draw ever closer it is recommended the shotgun wielder adopts a bracing posture, ready for the recoil of rapid shotgun rounds (see Halo ). As soon as the zombies reach a distance of approximately 2 meters start firing into their midst, aiming for their heads (as this is proven to have the most effect). Once the zombies in the cloud have been reduced to their component atoms it is strongly suggested that the wielder moves on, as zombies are naturally attracted to the sound of shotguns firing, this may seem strange at first, but if enough clouds gather the shotgun wielder will be overcome and turned into a zombie him/herself. \nThe Military Mop-up is when, at the end of an outbreak, the military show up and kill as many zombies as the zombie squad killed in the last three days in 20 seconds using their assault rifles. Anyone in the squad who is still alive at this point (usually two people of the opposite sex) is guaranteed not to die later on. edit Escaping the Cloud \nThe cloud of zombies is medium paced and very scary. Some people will be tempted to look over their shoulders and see that the zombies are about 0.5 meters behind them, then after getting the shit scared out of them, they run faster when not needed and get really tired so they start slowing down. If you have particlarly bad luck or are just not good with these situations the cloud will follow your every move. REMEMBER . the cloud CAN move through fences and fly-screens so don't bother hiding. To shorten this down into a few words: The best way to escape the cloud is to shoot yourself in the head with the shotgun (if you haven't dropped it in an attempt to lighten yourself up after long hours of running). If you want to actually survive the zombie-cloud you might have to lock yourself in an airtight room for a couple of thousand years and wait for the cloud to disperse or follow some other defenseless victim. There are a few cases of keeping the zombies preoccupied until you are out of sensory range, but this is not recommended. edit In Case of Death Burn the corpses using napalm or petrol, then bury the remains. Blow up the corpse with a grenade. Lock the corpse into a secure confined space away from people. \"Remove the head or destroy the brain\". Totally. Throw the corpse from a high window(if it zombifies it wont be able to climb back up). Throw the corpse down a bottomless pit(if one is available - many are available throughout Greece). Take a picture of yourself with the hot dead chick that lived across the street. You can convince people it's your girlfriend and get some high fives from your buddies. If you do not have the materials to destroy the bodies, ensure that the bodily fluids of the deceased are kept away from the living, as they may contain zombifying pathogens, as well as venereal diseases. \nIn the instance of your own death, you are unlikely to be able to perform the required actions. So pin a note to yourself of what to do, to ensure that others are aware of the situation, or a bomb to go off when you die (or zombify). edit Do Not \nStay near anyone with short hair, nice teeth and big muscles called Chris or Leon. This means that you are a supporting character and could wander into a fatal cut-scene at any moment. Although this may be difficult...Leon is pretty dashing. \nWalk into a dark dark room or mysterious building. There will always be zombies in there, ALWAYS! If you do go inside, usually about half of your group will be picked off by the zombies and other crap that is waiting for you inside. \nFollow the sound of a woman crying. You will eventually find a woman in ragged clothes crouched in the corner. If you poke her or shine light at her, she will turn around, and she will always turn out to be a super zombie-bitch who will then proceed to rip you into 54 equally sized pieces. \nGrind zombies up into chili for food. Always resort to cannibalism when desperate for food. get rid of the weakest members first (i.e old people, though they would taste horrible). NEVER have zombie chili, since it will turn you into a zombie, not to mention have a bad bout of indigestion. \nFor God's sake people, how many scenes in zombie movies do you see one of the characters getting killed because they were standing in front of a window? Never sit in front of a window, your also walking into a fatal cut-scene at any moment. \nHave sex with a female zombie. Because 1. Its disgusting, 2. Female zombies grow teeth on their vaginas during the zombification process, which means if you try to stick your dick in there, it'll will get ripped off. 3. If one manages to bypass the vagina-fangs and gets the zombie pregnant, she will give birth to a baby zombie, which means you paying child support...with your brains. edit Surviving the Fallout \nThe following section is related to the events that will occur directly after the zombie outbreak has been quelled, and will have basic tips on how to survive in a world devastated by a massive zombie invasion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:07:35.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
