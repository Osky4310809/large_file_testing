King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 15 hours ago 5 \nIn Corey Taylor's opinion, Stone Sour's upcoming new album \"Hydrograd\" is the coolest effort he recorded since Slipknot's 1999 self-titled debut album. \nThe singer told BBC Radio : \"We have six singles on this album. We're just gonna come out and bust people and see what happens. \n\"I'm really, really excited. This album is great because it's got elements of everything: it's got the heavy energy of the '80s, thereâ€™s punk moments, there's hard rock moments - all the great amalgam of music. Hell, there's even jazz and hip hop moments. It's really, really cool. \n\"It's probably the coolest album I've made since the first Slipknot album. It's dope, dude. I feel very confident making that statement 'cause it's so good.\" \nAs reported, the album is tentatively due this summer. \nCorey said a few weeks ago: \"We are doing everything old school. We're recording it live and then layering stuff on top of it. We are doing a song a day, and we've already done nine songs; we're about halfway done. And, yeah, it is incredible; it's the best stuff we've ever written.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:59:52.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
