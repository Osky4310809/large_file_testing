I did not hear them scrutinizing the plan with facts and figures. They were just delaying and they were saying this is just wrong,” he said. \nIt’s weird since almost every Democrat that has come to the defense of Obamacare also said that the bill needs to be fixed to curb rising premiums. Even Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) admitted that there are portions of the bill that need to be fixed when he debated this subject with Sen. Ted Cruz (D-TX) on CNN in January. This was after a discussion about how men and elderly women are wasting money after being required to pay for maternity care in their Obamacare plans. \nAnd yes, Mr. Cuomo—the Democrats plan to just complain and offer little in their total war campaign against President Trump. It’s a war that has allies of Obamacare—American Medical Association (AMA) and American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)—opposing the GOP bill after going gaga over Obamacare. After 28 hours, the Energy and Commerce Committee finally joined the House Ways and Means committee in approving the replacement bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T06:24:15.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
