And to make matters worse, Trump didn’t even personally acknowledge her at the event, so it was all kinda done for nothing. \n“Originally I was supposed to perform directly after his first speech, and I had done that with Barack Obama before, so I was used to that kind of experience. And the woman who organized the event came and told me, \"Now you’re going to go first and he’s going to go after you.\" I looked her in the eye and said, \"My family has disowned me. If you decide to Google me, you’ll see that America is writing about me in their newspapers. I’m the black poster child for discord right now, and he’s not going to shake my hand?\" So no, I didn’t get to meet him.” - Chrisette via Billboard. \nChrisette also talked in-depth about her upcoming project “No Political Genius,” Trump supporting anti-abortion orders, her reaction to the Women’s march this weekend, and a whole lot more. Read all that in the lengthy interview with Billboard right here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T05:29:57.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
