For me it is, sadly, a possibility he may have overdosed.” \nPolice are still investigating the circumstances leading up to 53-year-old George’s death at his home after a post-mortem examination on December 29 proved inconclusive. \nReports have claimed the Wham! star may have died after taking an overdose, but further tests will now be carried out. \nCarlos has watched the events unfold from Australia – where the pair enjoyed a night of passion – with sadness and dismay.

I found him a lovely down-to-earth man, but also a very melancholic person who I feared might one day take his own life. \n“He told me he was addicted to anti-depressant medicine and trying to wean himself off it and confessed he was unhappy. \n“We talked about his superstar status and I told him I thought that with his fame and talent and money he had all he needed to be happy in life. \n“But when he started talking about the anti-depressants he took I asked him outright if he was happy in life and he replied, ‘No, I’m not.’ \nCarlos – who left a job managing a park cemetery in his native Cali to move to Australia to improve his English – says memories of that night in 2013 have come flooding back since the tragedy. \nHe recalled how the singer flirted with him on a gay contact website then invited him to suite 12 at Sydney’s ­luxurious Park Hyatt hotel near the famous opera house. \nCarlos said: “I had just come in from a night out when I turned on my computer and saw a message from someone with George Michael’s profile and pictures, saying he found me very sexy. \n“I replied asking if it was the singer himself, but I imagined it was just someone who idolised him and was using his name. \n“It wasn’t until I turned up at his hotel and he opened the door in his pyjama bottoms and bare-chested that I was sure it was him. \n“It was a wonderful feeling meeting a man whose songs I loved. We made love and then started talking while he ordered pink Champagne to the room. \n“I asked him about some of the celebs he’d met and he talked to me about Michael Jackson and Princess Diana.

But it was when we started talking about his own life that his unhappiness and use of anti-depressants came up. \n“He said he was no longer with his long-term partner Kenny Goss, but that they were still living in the same house together. He asked me to spend time with him in the UK but I said I didn’t think it appropriate while he was still living with an ex. I think he liked me and was looking to spend time with someone whose company he enjoyed.” \nCarlos, now single, recalled one disturbing incident during their night of passion. He said the singer disappeared while they were together to “see a friend”. Carlos said he feared the star might take his life (Photo: Damian Shaw/Sunday Mirror) \nHe came back 20 minutes later before delving into a suitcase and going into the bathroom to empty some drops from a small bottle into a glass of water he gulped down. \nCarlos said: “I knew they were drugs, but I didn’t ask him what they were and we never talked about it. \n“They didn’t alter his mood particularly. All he drank apart from the Champagne was Coca-Cola which he told me he downed by the gallon and was addicted to along with chocolate.” \nCarlos says he left the hotel the next afternoon because the star, who once boasted of having 500 lovers in seven years, “had another commitment”.
