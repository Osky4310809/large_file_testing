There are broad-spectrum sunscreens that can keep damage from happening in the first place. But until now, there hasn’t been a cream that could actually interfere with the frowny muscle contractions that make wrinkling—no matter how well you coddle your skin—inevitable. Until now. La Prairie just launched the new La Prairie Line Interception Power Duo, which goes where no cream has gone before. The night cream is nothing out of the ordinary: Collagen-stimulating peptides, hydrating ingredients. But the day cream by its side? Pretty impressive. Along with hyaluronic acid, it contains special peptides that actually interfere with your facial muscle’s ability to contract. Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-52 actually reduces the amount of neurotransmitters (calcium, acetylcholine, and sodium) that can get through the calcium channel through which your brain tells your muscles to contract.
