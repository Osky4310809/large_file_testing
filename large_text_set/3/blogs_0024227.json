She hasn’t reveled in the spotlight, she doesn’t stay in the gossip papers, and for so long, she’s been able to keep her private life private. She doesn’t even get snapped by paparazzi, that’s how low she keeps it when it comes to her public profile. Honestly, the last time we consistently had the chance to see her out of the house was when she was touring with her band to promote the  Soldier of Love  album in 2011. It’s 2017.\nSo imagine our shock when Sade popped up on Instagram, at a Drake concert, and hugged up with the rapper (and his mother) backstage.\n\n\nShe was snapped at the rapper’s “Boy Meets World” tour stop in London, and the Internet didn’t know what to think of a moment that many would given hellas to have with the music legend. Our favorite tweet?\n@yusufyuie drake in a photo with Sade? Sade??? pic.twitter.com/bigqachXQ5 \n— 8th Sage (@Iceyhands) March 21, 2017 \n\nBut despite what the entire Internet community had to say about it, Drake was more than appreciative of Sade’s presence at his show, and she has love for the rapper. For his birthday, he was gifted a signed Sade poster:\n\nAnd Drake just proved he’s a superfan by getting a tattoo of the singer’s face and her signature, seen on the above framed poster, on his body earlier this week:\n \n\nHe’s got Aaliyah on his back, Sade on his side, and a tattoo of a camo toy shark he gave Rihanna on his arm. Now we can’t help but wonder if he actually showed Sade his new ink, but in order to actually get her to be that close to him for a picture, we doubt it…\nThe post Drake Gets Sade Out Of Seclusion And Thanks Her By Tattooing The Singer’s Face On His Body appeared first on MadameNoire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:41:26.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
