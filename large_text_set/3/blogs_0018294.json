This Friday, however, will see the arrival of the new Power Rangers movie. Compared to the likes of Wonder Woman or Batman or Spider-Man, the Power Rangers are still a relatively young franchise, but in fact their brief time as a franchise has already seen a lot of development and evolution. That in mind, dive in to the full history in our Power Rangers Origins and Evolutions piece! \nSaban’s Power Rangers follows five ordinary high school kids who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove – and the world – is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover that they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so they will have to overcome their real-life issues and band together as the Power Rangers before it is too late. \nThe Power Rangers cast includes Dacre Montgomery ( A Few Less Men ) as Jason the Red Ranger, RJ Cyler ( Me and Earl and the Dying Girl ) as Billy the Blue Ranger, Naomi Scott ( The 33 ) as Kimberly the Pink Ranger, Becky G ( Empire ) as Trini the Yellow Ranger, Ludi Lin ( Monster Hunt ) as Zack the Black Ranger, with Bill Hader ( Saturday Night Live ) voicing Alpha 5, Bryan Cranston (“Breaking Bad,” Godzilla ) as Zordon, and Elizabeth Banks as villain Rita Repulsa. \nDirected by Dean Israelite ( Project Almanac ), Power Rangers is written by John Gatins ( Kong: Skull Island , Real Steel ), Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama ( Dracula Untold ), Zack Stentz and Ashley Miller ( X-Men: First Class , Thor ), and Max Landis ( Chronicle ). Producers are Power Rangers creator Haim Saban, Brian Casentini, Wyck Godfrey, and Marty Bowen ( The Twilight Saga , The Fault in Our Stars , The Maze Runner franchise).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:14:52.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
