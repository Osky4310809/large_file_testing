Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. \nIn his opening paragraph Trump tries to put out some recent fires. He was highly unpopular among African American voters and his choice of attorney general, Jeff Sessions, faced scrutiny over his civil rights record, but here is a name check for Black History Month. Critics say he was slow to condemn antisemitic attacks but here are specific mentions of incidents at Jewish community centres and cemeteries. Trump had also faced calls to condemn last week’s shooting of two Indian men in Kansas City – and now he has. All boxes ticked. \nA new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. \nThe clue was in the tie: blue and white stripes instead of the usual angry red. Whereas his inaugural address dwelled on “American carnage” with “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones”, the nub of this speech could be summed up as “ American greatness ”. The appeal is to an old idea of American exceptionalism: manifest destiny, the greatest generation, the right stuff, Ronald Reagan’s “shining city upon a hill”, even Barack Obama’s references to this being “the greatest nation on earth”, and of course Trump’s own slogan “Make America great again”. Campaign lines such as “drain the swamp” also made an appearance to keep him in touch with the base. \nDying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. \nThis passage reads almost like the narration of a slow motion film, with flowers sprouting and black and white turning to colour. Many of the claims seem hopelessly ambitious and idealistic: some of the “dying industries” involve factories where machines have replaced humans and the clock cannot be turned back. Who will pay for the infrastructure programme? How will the drug epidemic be stopped? Trump cannot, at least, be accused of aiming low. \nTo any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders? Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism. \nTrump bites back at critics of his travel bans, insisting that he is keeping the nation safe. At last year’s Republican national convention it felt emotionally exploitative to some when families of people killed by undocumented immigrants were paraded. Family members were in the spotlight again in a similarly questionable stunt on Tuesday night. Meanwhile Trump seemed to relish his use of the divisive phrase “radical Islamic terrorism”, something which his new national security adviser, HR McMaster, reportedly advises against . \nThe time has come for a new programme of national rebuilding. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country – twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. \nHis claim that America spent about six trillion dollars in the Middle East is questionable. Trump asks for $1tn investment in infrastructure financed through both public and private capital. Democrats have already come up with an infrastructure proposal: this is an area where they could potentially find common cause, since there are plenty of bipartisan grumbles about “third world airports” and slow railways. Trump’s reference to the ability to negotiate was no doubt about himself: Mike Pence and Paul Ryan, sitting behind, got the joke and laughed. \nEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more – so why not join forces to finally get the job done and get it done right? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people. \nConsciously or otherwise, there are echoes of two former presidents. Bill Clinton said: “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.” Obama, in his final state of the union address, said “the rancour and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better”. Trump tries to reach across the aisle and appeal to Democrats to end the hyperpartisanship of Washington but calls for unity with a uniquely divisive agenda. Democrats were relatively restrained through the address but are under pressure for their liberal base to oppose him at every turn. \nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a US Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero – battling against terrorism and securing our nation. I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.” Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity. And Ryan is looking down right now, you know that, and he’s very happy because I think he just broke a record. \nThis was the most powerful moment of the night and, some would say, the only emotionally authentic one. Congress stood to applaud Carryn Owens, who stood with hands clasped and gazed up at the heavens and could be seen whispering, “Love you”. Trump could not resist ad libbing a line about record applause, which some found inappropriate. Even more jarringly, earlier on Tuesday, Trump appeared to duck responsibility for ordering the raid in Yemen that killed Owens, telling Fox News: “This was a mission that was started before I got here. This was something they wanted to do. They came to me, they explained what they wanted to do – the generals –who are very respected, my generals are the most respected that we’ve had in many decades, I believe. And they lost Ryan. \nFree nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people – and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict – not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past – we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. \nThe Trump doctrine on foreign policy remains obscure beyond America First. On Tuesday he expressed strong support for Nato and claimed its members are starting to pay their share. He also offered a few tantalising glimpses of a worldview. Respecting the right of nations to chart their own path chimes with previous statements that days of trying to impose western-style democracy are over. The reference to “mistakes of the past” could mean Vietnam and probably Iraq, of which he has been harshly critical, despite expressing approval at the time. \nWhen we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. \nTrump recalled America’s centennial, in Philadelphia, where builders, artists and inventors showed off their creations: Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone, Remington unveiled the first typewriter and Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. This is indicative of the 70-year-old white man’s nostalgia for a golden age, for a lost greatness that must be restored. In addition, the time for small thinking is over – a natural sentiment for the builder of Trump Tower who specialises in “truthful hyperbole”. But whether he has fought his last “trivial fight” remains to be seen.
