And it's led to several letter-writing events across the country â€” all with the goal of mailing thousands of postcards to Trump and possibly turning this into a regular thing.\n#TheIdesOfTrump #Impeach45 send your postcard today! #resist\nA post shared by Sam Moyer (@samuelmoyerfurniture) on Mar 15, 2017 at 7:13am PDT\nIt's simple to participate in the Ides of Trump, all you need is something to say in your note. Organizers suggest unloading your frustration on a number of issues from immigration, the environment to conflicts of interest and even \"the existence of facts.\"\nOrganizers don't care what you have to say, as long as enough people put pen to paper and show Trump that they are not OK with his policies.\nMany people have shared their postcards online.\nGot my #IdesOfTrump postcard sent off today. ðŸ˜‰ How about you?
