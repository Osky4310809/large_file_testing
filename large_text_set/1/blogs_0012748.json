Jan 12th 2017 11:26AM \nOne of the world's 30 richest men lost big after Donald Trump's shock election win. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, famed hedge fund investor George Soros reportedly lost around $1 billion dollars after his election win caused the stock market to rally. \nSoros was a huge supporter of Hillary Clinton, committing $25 million dollars to her campaign. \nSoros was one of many who betted on a Trump win causing a massive selloff, but instead, the market has rallied nearly 10%. \nBut despite the loss, Soros Fund Management gained 5% for the year. \nSoros has since called Trump a \"would-be dictator\" and that \"democracy is now in crisis.\" \nHe has since pledged $10 million dollars to fight an increase in hate crimes he links to Trump's \"incendiary rhetoric.\" \nRELATED: Trump since becoming president-elect 20 PHOTOS Donald Trump since becoming president-elect See Gallery Donald Trump since becoming president-elect Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump arrives for his election night rally at the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 9, 2016.
