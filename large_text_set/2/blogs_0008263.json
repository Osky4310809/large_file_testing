(Torrie, Keith) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   8:00 PM \nLarry Johnson finds himself in the most uncomfortable of places — caught between loyalty to an organization and boss that have been good to him and supporting a former teammate who always had his back. \n\"It's hard to work at the Garden when Oak is not part of the family,\" Johnson told the Daily News on Saturday \nJohnson, the popular Knicks power forward from the team that reached the 1999 NBA Finals, is conflicted over whether to report to work for Sunday's afternoon game against the San Antonio Spurs. \nIn fact, Johnson is considering not attending Knicks games until the feud with Charles Oakley and Garden management is resolved. \nFollow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. \"Like\" us here. \n\"I love the Knicks and Mr. (James) Dolan is my guy,\" Johnson added. \"But I feel as if I'd be disrespecting Oak if I go to the Garden.\" \nThe sad events of the past few days have had a profound impact on a player they call LJ, who is also beloved by his former coaches and teammates. \nHe also calls both Oakley and Dolan friends. That is why this is all so difficult for him to wrap his head around what transpired last week. \nIt was disturbing for Johnson to watch Oakley carried out of the Garden on Wednesday and arrested following an altercation with security guards. And it hurt him when Dolan, the MSG Chairman, announced Friday that Oakley is indefinitely banned from entering the World's Most Famous Arena. Charles Oakley's Knicks years (TORRIE, KEITH) \nJohnson's official title is Basketball and Business Operations Representative. His duties include meeting with sponsors and season ticket holders before games. He also attends Garden charity events and outreach programs with children in the greater New York City region. \nJohnson is thrilled that he reconnected with the Knicks five years ago. He repeatedly stressed that he loves his job and the people he works for. But something doesn't feel right. \nJohnson is one of several former Oakley teammates who work for the Garden in some capacity. John Starks has a similar role as Johnson. Allan Houston is the general manager of the D-League Westchester Knicks and Herb Williams is an assistant coach with the WNBA Liberty. \nIt's only natural if they all feel the same way Johnson feels today. They have an obligation to remain dedicated to Dolan and their jobs but they don't want to be perceived as not supporting Oakley. \nKnicks owner James Dolan is in classless league of his own \nOne former Knick, who did not want to be identified and is not employed by the team, seemed to sum up the emotions that many teammates and fans are feeling about the entire episode. \n\"I can't believe that one of the best organizations in sports is treating a beloved player like Charles Oakley this way,\" the player said. \"He gave his heart to the team and this city. Ownership needs to man up and call Charles in for a sit down. This (nonsense) needs to end.\" \nCoincidentally, Johnson also thinks that if Oakley and Dolan met they could find common ground. Larry Johnson's official title with the Knicks is Basketball and Business Operations Representative. (Sipkin, Corey, New York Daily News/New York Daily News) \nSeveral league executives have suggested that Michael Jordan could mediate a sit down. Jordan, the owner of the Charlotte Hornets, has a connection to Dolan and especially Oakley, his long-time friend and former teammate with the Chicago Bulls. \nCharles Oakley banned from Garden; Dolan says 'he has a problem' \nOn Friday, Oakley watched the second half of the Knicks loss to Denver from De Novo, a restaurant in Upper Montclair, N.J. He told The News that he has spoken with Jordan since the arrest but declined to discuss the details of their conversation. \nThroughout the night, patrons approached Oakley and provided words of encouragement. He later posed for photos before returning to Manhattan. \nJohnson's relationship with Oakley got off to an awkward start. They became teammates in the summer of 1996, the same offseason when the Knicks signed Houston and Chris Childs to free agent contracts. Johnson was acquired from Charlotte in the Anthony Mason trade. \nA few months earlier, a physical game between the Knicks and Hornets escalated into a near brawl when the team's respective muscle men grabbed each other by the throat. \nOnce Johnson was traded to New York and became Oakley's teammate the war was over. \n\"I remember my mother asking me before training camp started, 'Will you and Charles be able to get along,'\" Johnson said during training camp in 1996. \"We're cool now. We're on the same team.” Wicked Garden: A look at the worst moments in the history of Madison Square Garden \nNow brothers in arms, Oakley and Johnson along with Patrick Ewing became one of the league's best and most feared front lines. The Knicks won 57 games that first season with Johnson.The following year, with Ewing sidelined, they upset Miami in the first round, a series best remembered by Johnson and Alonzo Mourning fighting in the final seconds of a Game 4 victory. \nSomehow, Jeff Van Gundy ended up on the floor holding onto Mourning's leg with Oakley trying to pull him off. The wild scene cemented their places as folk heroes among Garden faithful. Nearly 20 years later the 90's Knicks are still revered. \nOn Friday, Van Gundy told SiriusXM NBA Radio that Oakley, just like Johnson and Ewing, may have never won an NBA title but they always practiced and \"played like champions.\" \nThose battles unified a city, a team and an organization \nIt also brought Oakley and Johnson closer. They are friends forever. \nAnd Larry Johnson wants to make sure Charles Oakley never forgets that. \n\"Oak, Johnson said quietly, \"is my guy.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:01:33.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
