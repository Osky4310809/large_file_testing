Determined to become “normal” like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of his handy best friend Hi-5 and the notorious code breaker emoji Jailbreak. Together, they embark on an epic “app-venture” through the apps on the phone, each its own wild and fun world, to find the Code that will fix Gene.

UNTITLED ANIMATED SPIDER-MAN (December 21, 2018) \nFrom Phil Lord & Christopher Miller, the geniuses behind The LEGO Movie , comes an animated Spider-Man feature starring Miles Morales. \nLord and Miller introduced a brief Spider-Man tease that showed off some concept art and a graffiti-styled red and blue spider logo. While Morales is under the mask, the Spidey costume appeared from the footage to be more in line with the classic blue and red design. We also saw some shots of Spidey chasing Prowler and a massive Green Goblin statue. Although the animation was far from finished, it appears that film will employ a unique style that combines classic comic book illustrations with CGI. During the action sequences, frames flash from CGI to having textures straight out of a comic book. \nThe feature is directed by Bob Persichetti (head of story on Puss in Boots and The Little Prince) and Peter Ramsey ( Rise of the Guardians ). The film is written by Phil Lord. Avi Arad ( Iron Man , Spider-Man ), Amy Pascal ( Spider-Man: Homecoming ), Phil Lord & Christopher Miller are executive producing; Christina Steinberg ( Trollhunters ) is producing.
