But with members who join the party after Tuesday ineligible to vote for for party leader — and , in a ranked-ballot race, with down-ballot support from members whose first-choice candidates prove to be also-rans potentially vital to deciding the winner — each campaign will now try to signal however it can that its candidate has momentum.\nTo that end, the campaigns will point to some metrics that can be publicly confirm, such as caucus endorsements and fundraising numbers, but also to others more difficult to verify, such as the number of members each campaign claims to have signed up or the results of internal polls.\nMaxime Bernier’s campaign, for example, issued a press release Tuesday saying that it had raised a whopping $126,000 at a single Vancouver fundraising event Monday night. In Canadian federal politics, where corporate and union donations are banned and where any one individual may give a maximum of only about $1,200 a year to any one candidate, that’s a significant number. \nThe most recent fundraising numbers verified by Elections Canada, based on filings from October through December, showed Bernier leading the pack with $586,165, and more than twice the number of individual donations received by his closest rival. Kellie Leitch and Andrew Scheer rounded out the top three, collecting $355,121 and $324,546 respectively. The next round of fundraising data, based on January through March, is expected to be released April 30 and will offer the first verified insight into the fundraising operation of Kevin O’Leary, who joined the race late. O’Leary’s camp bragged in February of raising $183,964 in a single day.\nIan Kucerak/Postmedia Candidate, and former speaker of the House of Commons, Andrew Scheer at the Conservative leadership debate in Edmonton on Tuesday, Feb. 28. To argue that fundraising success is a reasonable proxy for actual voter support, the Bernier campaign provided its most recent internal polling data to the National Post, which the campaign argued shows Bernier and O’Leary have put some distance between themselves and the pack.\n(Typically, in any political race or election, internal polls from any campaign are only publicly released if they can help a campaign or show off a campaign’s success.)\nThe Bernier campaign did a telephone poll on March 21 of 2,709 members of the Conservative Party (and, therefore, eligible leadership voters). Those polled were on the membership list party headquarters provided to every campaign.\nRelated Tory race update: O’Toole overtakes Scheer, Saxton dares to be dull John Ivison: Slow, steady O’Toole makes his pitch to be the CPC’s consensus candidate Conservative Party expels nearly 1,400 members after three leadership campaigns allege fraud Of those surveyed in the Bernier camp’s internal poll, 25.3 per cent intended to pick Bernier as their first choice and 23 per cent favour O’Leary as first choice on what will be a ranked ballot. After that, the poll showed first-ballot support for Andrew Scheer at 13 per cent, Kellie Leitch at 10.9 per cent, Erin O’Toole at 7.2 per cent and Lisa Raitt at 6 per cent. Every other candidate polled below five per cent. \nMeanwhile, though the O’Leary campaign was unwilling to share its internal polling data, a senior advisor for the campaign said it shows O’Leary in the lead, followed by Bernier, Leitch, Scheer and O’Toole or Raitt in fifth spot. This ranking more or less matches public polling data from Mainstreet Research, which has been tracking the race week-to-week. \nAnd the Scheer campaign released to supporters results of its own internal polling in February. According to campaign manager Hamish Marshall, the poll was based on 11,383 responses from party members. To participate, people had to click open an email from the Scheer campaign — though to help control a potential skewing of results, Marshall said, Scheer donors and volunteers were cross-referenced out. That particular exercise showed Scheer in the lead with 23.1 per cent support, followed by Bernier with 20.7 per cent and O’Leary with 12.5 per cent. \nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Codie McLachlan Kellie Leitch speaks during the Conservative leadership debate at the Maclab Theatre in Edmonton, Alta., on Tuesday, Feb. 28, 2017. In lieu of internal polling, the Leitch campaign instead offered a claim about its support among new members. “We have sold in excess of 30,000 memberships,” said communications director Michael Diamond. It’s currently impossible to test the veracity of such a claim, though the party is likely to release the official number of total memberships sold sometime in the weeks after Tuesday’s deadline. \nCampaigns will receive a final list of all eligible party members on April 28, according to party spokesman Cory Hann. They will then have about a month to market themselves directly to those members before a new leader is chosen on May 27.\nIt is expected to take multiple rounds of voting before any candidate reaches the 50-per-cent threshold required to win. Via a mathematical calculation, first-choice votes will be converted to a points system depending on each candidate’s level of support in individual ridings. With Canada’s 338 ridings weighted equally, points are then added up, and the candidate with the fewest points is eliminated. Voters who supported that candidate as their first choice will then be redistributed based on voters’ second choice, with the process continuing round by round until someone earns a majority. \n• Email: dakin@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidakin \n• Email: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: mariedanielles \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:13:49.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
