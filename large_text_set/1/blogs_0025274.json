Where are you @luisnani training starts in 5 minutes? \nThe 27-year-old sent a tweet to Valencia winger Nani asking him why he had yet to turn up for Hull training, much to the amusement of Tigers fans. Anyone got the postcode for BodyMoor Heath? â€” DM (@DavidMeyler7) January 31, 2017 \nMeyler even went one further, suggesting that he may link up with former Hull boss Steve Bruce at Aston Villa, enquiring as to the address of their Bodymoor Heath training ground. \nThe midfielder is very active on Twitter, engaging with fans, and also has a live streaming account with Twitch where he plays FIFA 17 games for charity.
