Luckily for Thomas Fletcher , though, he has known the player he’ll supersede since he was a freshman in high school. \nThe Crimson Tide’s long snapper for the past four seasons, Cole Mazza , exhausted his eligibility and will look to join an NFL team either through the NFL Draft or via free agency. But the outgoing specialist essentially hand-picked Fletcher as his replacement and shared that with his coaches. \n“Because I’ve been teaching at the Rubio (Long Snapping) camps, I’ve been around him,” Mazza told BamaOnLine at the Reese’s Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. “I’ve been in Coach (Bobby) Williams’ ear and Coach (Nick) Saban’s ear, and his ear as well, recruiting him the whole time. Hopefully he can come in and take my spot and make an impact right away.” (Make sure you're in the know by signing up for FREE Alabama newsletter! ) \nA 55-game starter, Mazza was the model of consistency the past four years for Alabama. The No. 1 long snapper in the 2013 recruiting cycle, according to the 247Sports Composite, Mazza only missed two games because of injury throughout his entire career. \nAnd Fletcher is hoping to accomplish the same.

An IMG Academy product, Fletcher earned a five-star ranking while at the Rubio Long Snapping Camp in 2016. \nThe relationship he established with Mazza as a high school freshman at the camps was something Fletcher credited with him ultimately committing and signing with Alabama. \n“I remember my first camp, Cole was a freshman here. Seeing him and realizing that we shared the same class and that I would have an opportunity to play here, I immediately befriended him,” Fletcher said on National Signing Day. “And he was fantastic throughout the whole process. \n“He was really supportive of me wanting to come here, and he was very honest about what it would take to play here and how it’s different from other programs and everything like that. He’s been phenomenal just to me personally and, obviously, on the field he’s been really incredible. I think he’s gonna have a really long career after this, for sure.” \nOften overlooked, long snappers and specialists don’t receive five- or even four-star ratings from recruiting services. But Mazza was perfect on every snap he executed while wearing a Crimson Tide uniform from his freshman year in 2013 to this past season. \nIn order to continue that trend with a seamless transition, Fletcher knows where he will begin his preparation to obtain the starting job on field goals and punts for the Tide in 2017. \n“Really just learning the difference of the game between high school and college because obviously it’s much, much different,” Fletcher said. “And so that’s just gonna be on me to make the transition as far as in the weight room, in conditioning and in practice and all that sort of stuff.” \nDespite only earning two stars, Fletcher is one of nine players in Alabama’s 26-member class that is ranked among the top-three players at his position -- high school or junior college. \nHe has big shoes to fill, but being a top-rated snapper himself, Fletcher is certainly qualified to start Day 1. Knowing that, though, was there ever any competitive banter between the outgoing and incoming Alabama snappers during their days at Rubio camps? \n“It was very respectful between the two of us,” Fletcher said. “He’s passionate about his time playing here, for sure, and he’s passionate about wanting me to come in and hopefully, God willing, have half the success that he had. But he’s been phenomenal throughout the entire process for me.” *** Subscribe to BamaOnLine: Buy 1 month, GET 2 MONTHS FREE *** Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T17:30:25.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
