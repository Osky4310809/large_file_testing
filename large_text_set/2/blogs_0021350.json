The show took place in Reading, Pennsylvania last Saturday. The self-proclaimed Queen of NY put out the Nicki Minaj diss record the day after Nicki took shots at her on Gucci Mane 's \" Make Love .\" \n\"I don't want to hear about your records and big numbers,\" Remy said during the show. \"'Cause I was up top, seven winters and six summers.\" \nPeople are still reeling from the savage diss track and videos of the event are circulating online. At one point, its seems like Remy forgets the words to the song but that would be normal considering she just penned it. \nNicki has yet to responded to Remy. She had a Twitter squabble with Trey Songz the day \"ShETHER\" came out. when you see @remyma in concert the same day she BODIED @nickiminaj #shETHER 😩😭🙌🏾 pic.twitter.com/V2TVYdl5CJ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:25:48.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
