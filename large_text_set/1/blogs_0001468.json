I often tell him “be yourself and be polite”. \n“I know that he will go through periods of adversity as there are jealous people out there, but I see him as a happy child.” \nDespite recognising the pressures of a high-profile career Ronaldo, 31, would happily see his son follow in his footsteps. “Of course I would like it if he became a footballer,” he said. \n“Know that it is a challenge and that it isn’t easy, but he can be whatever he wants to be as I won’t pressure him. \n“I might be pushing him a little in the direction of becoming a footballer, but not to be a goalkeeper as I want him to be a forward!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:31:54.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
