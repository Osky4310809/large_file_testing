With March Madness starting next week, this will be a great way to catch several live games at once from TNT, TBS, TruTV and CBS.* You can also use this feature for any live TV channel available on Vue, such as watching a mix of live news programs or live events at once.\n\nMulti-view will be available on PS4 starting today. The new feature gives you the option to watch and listen to a main TV channel and view up to two additional channels at the same time. Keep an eye on all the action and enjoy mixing and matching your favorite channels.\nTo use this feature, just press and hold X on any live TV program from the Guide or Live TV row of the home screen to open up the selection screen for multi-view. A menu will pop up to give you an option of using either two or three multi-view screens. You can select any other live programing from the Live TV strand and start viewing multiple programs at once. The main screen in multi-view will contain audio of the programming.\nPress X to start any program. Press and hold X on any live program to start a multi-screen viewing experience.\nIf you want to switch programs within the multi-view screen, press Square on your DualShock 4. To move a program to the main screen, just highlight the smaller screen and press Square.\nOur team is currently hard at work to bring even more new features to PS Vue. Coming soon, real-time sports scores will be added to help you know the games to watch. You can also turn off spoiler alerts if you are waiting to watch the big game. Stay tuned for more information on the additional sports features we’re adding to PS Vue.\nWe’re pleased to bring you more new innovative features and we hope you enjoy multi-view during the tournament on PS Vue today — just in time for March Madness. Give it a try, and let us know what you think.\n*CBS is available live in major TV markets.
