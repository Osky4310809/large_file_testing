At Mingus, you get points for how big you go.”\nMingus was known for his genius as a bandleader, and for often losing his temper. He died in 1979 at the age of 76, but his widow Sue Mingus has carried on his work through a non-profit, which sponsors the high school competition.\n\nBaritone sax player Glynnis McNamara of the SFJAZZ HS All Stars (Photo: Courtesy of SFJAZZ) “I just really connect with Mingus, said Glynnis McNamara, a 17-year-old baritone saxophone player and senior at Middle College, a high school program at the College of San Mateo. “Because it captures the moment of spontaneity — of being in the moment of something passionate.”\nAll the bands will be playing Mingus songs, and the best of the soloists will get a chance to sit in with the Mingus Big Band at a New York Jazz club Sunday night.\n\n\n“The music is uncompromising and not meant to be commercial in any way,” said Sarah Cline, who directs the jazz program at Berkeley High School. “Charles Mingus’s work is especially important today, because it is in its essence protest music. His tunes like ‘Fables of Faubus”, about the ridiculousness of the racism of Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus in opposition to school desegregation by the Little Rock 9, teach us what it means to resist, to protest, and to speak truth through art.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:01:59.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
