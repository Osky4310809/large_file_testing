Brennan’s is an institution for Marina del Rey, located right off Lincoln Boulevard. The space has been pouring drinks as a casual Irish-tinged dive bar since 1972 , and doing their famed Thursday night turtle races for more than four decades. That’s right, if you don’t know Brennan’s, know this: Once a week, they race turtles in the parking lot. Now all that’s about to change. Eater has confirmed that Tony Yanow and the Artisanal team have taken over, and that Brennan’s will be shuttering in the near future for a remodel and update. A newer restaurant and bar menu will take its place, with plans to serve vegan food and craft beer down the line. No other specifics were otherwise available, and you should expect this one to take a while to come to life. Update : Reversing earlier confirmation given to Eater, the Artisanal Brewers Collective now says they will shut down the restaurant for a remodel, but have plans to keep the Brennan’s name and Irish vibe. After all, it’s not like the group hasn’t been busy buying up heaps of other properties (and entire hospitality groups ) for the past few months. The ABC group has gobbled up spaces from West Adams to La Brea to the Valley, and show absolutely no signs of slowing down. Want in on one last ride at the current Brennan’s Pub? Better get there soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:48:49.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
