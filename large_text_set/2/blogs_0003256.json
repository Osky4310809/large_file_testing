This year, DC Entertainment will be rolling out the much-anticipated Justice League flick whilst Marvel Studios continues its path to world domination. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will be the first superhero romp to premiere, but Thor will be making a return as well. The franchise’s third installment is set to debut in November, and fans have gotten a smattering of updates about the flick in the past months. And, now, the Internet is wondering whether it uncovered a new logo for Thor: Ragnarok thanks to Twitter. \nThanks to Artistworks, a picture of a t-shirt given to art department employees who work on Thor: Ragnarok has been shared online. The shirt features a slightly different logo than the one that Marvel has pushed around over the past year. The 1980s vibe is toned down as the ‘Ragnarok’ word coloring looks less vibrant than the other logo. And, right now, Marvel fans can’t help but notice how the eccentric artstyle mimics that of Jack Kirby’s. \nYou can check out the newest synopsis for Thor: Ragnarok below: \n\"In Marvel Studios' Thor: Ragnarok, Thor is imprisoned on the other side of the universe without his mighty hammer and finds himself in a race against time to get back to Asgard to stop Ragnarok – the destruction of his homeworld and the end of Asgardian civilization – at the hands of an all-powerful new threat, the ruthless Hela. But first he must survive a deadly gladatorial contest that pits him against his former ally and fellow Avenger – the Incredible Hulk!\" \nThe cast of Thor: Ragnarok features returning stars Chris Hemsworth (Rush) in the title role for the fifth time; Tom Hiddleston (Kong: Skull Island) as Thor’s adversarial, adopted brother, Loki; Idris Elba (The Dark Tower) as the Asgardian sentry, Heimdall; and Sir Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs) again portraying Odin, Ruler of Asgard. Newcomers to the franchise include Cate Blanchett (Cinderella) as the mysterious and powerful new villain Hela, Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park) as the eccentric Grandmaster, Tessa Thompson (Creed) as the classic hero Valkyrie, Karl Urban (Star Trek) as Skurge, and Mark Ruffalo (The Avengers) reprising his role of Bruce Banner/The Hulk. \nTHOR: RAGNAROK Gets An Updated Logo Seemingly Inspired By The Work Of Jack Kirby https://t.co/CBRoqXAxlN pic.twitter.com/pAb9lJwaNr \nMORE: Tom Hiddleston Teases Loki Meeting Doctor Strange / 5 Planet Hulk Easter Eggs We Need in Ragnarok | Doctor Strange Seemingly Confirmed For Thor: Ragnarok | Thor: Ragnarok Will Include Key Planet Hulk Character / Thor: Ragnarok Will Reportedly Feature Planet Hulk Content / First Look At Hulk And Thor In Battle / Hulk Weapons At CCXP / Does Hela Have A Soul Stone? / Set Video Of Hela's Stunts / Ragnarok's Possible Connection To Infinity War \nThor: Ragnarok , the third installment of Marvel’s popular Norse Super Hero, is directed by filmmaker Taika Waititi.
