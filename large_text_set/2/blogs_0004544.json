Temperatures will plunge towards the middle of the week, with forecasters even predicting snow in some parts. Tomorrow will see some parts drenched as a fifth of February's average rainfall is due to fall in one day. The West, Wales and the North West through to the South West are among areas that will be worst hit. The band of wet weather, which will be moving in from the Atlantic and heading slowly eastwards, could cause up to 20mm of rain and gusts of around 50mph in the West and up to 60mph in Scotland.

Forecaster Mark Wilson said: “After strong winds and rain on Monday, cold easterly winds from the continent are expected to make it turn colder from Wednesday. \"The winds’ original source is Russia and day will feel cold and nights will be below freezing, at -4C in rural parts, with the east generally coldest and with the greatest risk of any light snow.

Fellow Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said: \"From midweek onwards we will see an easterly set up begin to develop and it is going to feel quite chilly.

The odds on this month being the wettest stand at 1-2, with this month being the most blustery at 2-1. Coral's John Hill said: \"The betting suggests this February is likely to be the wettest on record as it is now odds on to see more rainfall than any before in the UK. \"We've also taken bets on wind speeds to reach as high as 100mph this month.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:19:04.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
