'Winners and losers' \nAjit Pai, the new head the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), said the repeal would help level the online playing field. \n“Last year, the Federal Communications Commission pushed through, on a party-line vote, privacy regulations designed to benefit one group of favoured companies over another group of disfavoured companies,” he said in a statement. \n\"Appropriately, Congress has passed a resolution to reject this approach of picking winners and losers before it takes effect. \n\"Moving forward, I want the American people to know that the FCC will work with the [Federal Trade Commission] to ensure that consumers’ online privacy is protected though a consistent and comprehensive framework.” \nBut advocates of internet rights have been left furious. \n“Today Congress proved once again that they care more about the wishes of the corporations that fund their campaigns than they do about the safety and security of their constituents,” said Evan Greer, campaign director from rights group Fight for the Future. \n\"People from across the political spectrum are outraged,” he added, \"and every lawmaker who votes to take away our privacy will regret it come election day.” \nThe group has launched a billboard campaign to publicise which members of Congress back the repeal. \nOther groups have expressed anger at the apparent silence of the major technology companies in the run up to the House vote. \n\"There are a lot of companies that are very concerned about drawing attention to themselves and being regulated on privacy issues, and are sitting this out in a way that they haven't sat out previous privacy issues,” said Craig Aaron from Free Press, a group which advocates for a more “open” internet. \nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC .
