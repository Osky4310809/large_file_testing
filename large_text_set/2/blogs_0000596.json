Photo by Brian Doben \nBeloved Portland-based ice cream outfit Salt & Straw has an official address for what will be its second Bay Area location: 580 Hayes St. \nWhen owners Kim and Tyler Malek announced their plans for the San Francisco expansion late last year, they weren’t ready to nail down specifics when it came to the Hayes Valley space. Now with everything seeming to be moving forward, they’re committing to the logistics. \nThe Hayes and Laguna address was the former site of Mediterranean restaurant Hayes & Kebab which was demolished in 2015 and has since been replaced by a 5-story mixed-use building. The upper floors are market-rate condos and the bottom floor, where Salt & Straw is setting up, is a few thousand square feet of retail space. \nIf everything goes as planned, the Salt & Straw team said their first location (2201 Fillmore St.) will open in mid-March, followed by Hayes Valley in May.

Since launching roughly five years ago, Salt & Straw has grown to include three shops in its hometown of Portland, and an additional four in Los Angeles. \nBoth Tyler and Kim said the culinary similarities between Portland and the Bay Area – specifically the locally sourced and seasonal offerings – influenced the move to San Francisco. \nThey also said their already quirky menu is going to be infused with local flavors. Some of the classic Portland offerings are honey lavender, pear and blue cheese ganache. Los Angeles has things like chocolate gooey brownie, and black olive brittle and goat cheese, among others. \nWe’ll get versions of those, along with the classic almond brittle (made from a Malek family recipe) and sea salt with caramel ribbons. \nSalt & Straw: 580 Hayes St.; set to open in May; www.saltandstraw.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:06:06.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
