No, but it sure feels like we did. \nICYMI, on Saturday, Sammi \"Sweetheart\" Giancola celebrated her 30th birthday by partying it up with her former Jersey Shore castmates ‚Äî including Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi , Jenni \"Jwoww\" Farley , Vinny Guadagnino , and Deena Cortese . LOVES it! \nRelated: Daria Has Turned 20! \nThe MTV celebs reunited at NY hotspot Beautique where they were seen drinking and dancing (with little to no fist pumping). But the Jersey Shore alums were not alone at the party as they were joined by Farley's husband, Roger Mathews ; Deena's fianc√©, Christopher Buckner ; Giancola's podcast cohost Clare Galterio ; MTV spokesman Michael Fabiani ; and famed Bachelor villain Olivia Caridi . \nNow THAT's a party!
