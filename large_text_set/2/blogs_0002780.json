AT&T uses zero rating to not charge its wireless customers for data they use while streaming DirecTV Now, the over-the-top service the company launched in November. The FCC sent a letter to AT&T in December expressing competitive concern about zero rating, but with a new regime led by net neutrality opponent Ajit Pai, CEO Randall Stephenson wasn’t worried about its longer-term prospects. Stephenson’s confidence was rewarded with Friday’s statement.

These free-data plans have proven to be popular among consumers, particularly low-income Americans, and have enhanced competition in the wireless marketplace,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. “Going forward, the Federal Communications Commission will not focus on denying Americans free data. Instead, we will concentrate on expanding broadband deployment and encouraging innovative service offerings.” \nRead original story FCC Drops Investigation of Sponsored Data Plans in First Blow to Net Neutrality  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:50:29.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
