It didn’t happen for The Avengers , it didn’t happen for The Incredibles , it didn’t even happen for The Dark Knight . \nBut ever since 2009, when the potential nominees for Best Picture went from 5 to 10, there’s typically been at least one crowd-pleasing blockbuster: Avatar , Toy Story 3 , Mad Max: Fury Road . This year’s frontrunners , however, lack a single film that’s expected to crack the $200 million barrier. (The last time that happened was in 2005 when Brokeback Mountain lead the pack with $178 million.) With Oscar ratings at an eight-year low , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences might be wise to sneak in one mega-hit everybody has seen, and that selection, as impossible as it sounds, might go to Deadpool . \nAnd if it does, Ryan Reynolds has something big planned.
