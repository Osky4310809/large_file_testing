At his press conference last week, the president called the leaks of information about his administration “criminal” and promised to stop them lest a genuinely dangerous leak flows into the press. “What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?” Trump asked. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus sounded a tangentially similar note of outrage on Face the Nation , complaining about “apparently false leaked documents, to create stories” in the press. He urged reporters to stop using unnamed sources in their stories, an odd request seeing as every administration—including this one—stages background briefings in which the official sources can’t be named.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:27:02.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
