"text": "Where: Sage Restaurant, Midleton, Co Cork \nWhat: Chef Kevin Aherne has a blissfully simple '12 mile' ethos. He tries - and largely succeeds - to source all the fish, meat and vegetables on his menus within 12 miles of the door (there's even a #12Mile roast on Sundays). It's a simple idea that says so much. Start with the salt-baked beets, served with candied oats and apples, and go from there (the gnocchi with Ballyhoura mushrooms is hard to resist). There's a lot more to East Cork than Ballymaloe. - PÓC \nHow much: €8 \nDetails: The Courtyard, Main Street; 021 463 9682; sagerestaurant.ie \nIf you like that, try this: In Cork City, chef Bryan McCarthy is working wonders with local produce - from Macroom lamb to snap-fresh fish - at Greenes ( greenes restaurant.com ). 12. Myrtle Allen's Carrageen moss pudding \n\nWhere: Ballymaloe House, Shanagarry, Co Cork \nWhat: The dessert trolley at Ballymaloe is an institution within an institution. The ever-present carrageen moss pudding is still made to Myrtle Allen's recipe and served with soft brown sugar and softly whipped cream. Wonderful waitstaff might recommend it with seasonal poached rhubarb, grown here from plants that once grew in the walled garden of Mrs Allen's childhood home in Cork. The perfect homage to Ireland's long-reigning culinary matriarch... and her native landscape. - AC \nDetails: Shanagarry; 021 465 2531; ballymaloe.ie \nHow much: €75pp (dinner); from €32 for lunch \nIf you like that, try this: Rebecca and Kay Harte's much-loved Farmgate Café ( farmgate.ie ) in Cork's English Market is the place to try that classic dish: tripe and onions with drisheen (a local blood sausage). 13. Comeragh Mountain Lamb \n\nWhere: The Tannery, Dungarvan, Co Waterford \nWhat: If you've ever wondered what purple heather, wildflowers and mountain spring water taste like, order Comeragh Mountain Lamb at The Tannery, reared by local farmers on the nearby mountainside. You can actually taste the animal's natural diet in the subtly flavoured meat that it produces. Chef-proprietor Paul Flynn and his team, who know how to extract maximum flavour from their larder, pair this local delicacy with heritage carrots, cabbage and wild mushroom broth. Magic, naturally. - AC \nDetails: 10 Quay Street; 058 45420; tannery.ie \nHow much: €29 \nIf you like that, try this: For a very different approach to local flavours, try the tasting menu at The Cliff House Hotel in Ardmore ( thecliffhousehotel.com ). Think local Helvick turbot served with Lismore chanterelles, pistachio, bee pollen and linseed… 14. Tempura of Goatsbridge Trout with seaweed \n\nWhere: Zuni, Kilkenny \nWhat: Rewind 10 or 15 years and imagine yourself ordering a tempura of local trout garnished with nori seaweed, pickled cucumber and horseradish in Kilkenny. Impossible? Today, fish from Mag Kirwan's Goatsbridge Trout Farm anchors a signature starter created by Maria Raftery at Zuni, the slick bistro on Patrick Street. The fish is velvety and bright, the seaweed surprising, and the cucumber and horseradish add bite and call your tongue to attention. Delicious. - PÓC \nHow much: €8.75 \nDetails: 26 Patrick Street; 056 772 3999; zuni.ie \nIf you like that, try this: Laura and Rory Gannon's Cakeface (cakefacepastry.com) is the devil. Exquisite cakes, pastries and desserts are just the start… could this prompt a reboot of Irishtown? 15. Hook Head crab cocktail \n\nWhere: Aldridge Lodge, Duncannon, Co Wexford \nWhat: Pound for pound, Billy Whitty and Joanne Harding's Aldridge Lodge just might offer the best-value dinner, bed and breakfast deal in Ireland. Served on Sundays and midweek, a €35 tasting menu throws up local plates with surprising flair, textures and complexity, given the unassuming guesthouse setting. Think Kilmore scallop spring rolls, for example, a monkfish tempura balanced with a courgette and peanut sauce, or a fat fillet of hake with local vegetables and a halo of light parsley and wild garlic butter. The crab cocktail perfectly sums up Aldridge Lodge's ethos and authenticity - served with Hook Head crab fished by Billy's father, Timmy (he supplies the lobster, too). A Wexford wonder. - PÓC \nHow much: Tasting menus from €35pp (B&B with dinner from €80pp) \nDetails: 051 389 116; aldridgelodge.com \nIf you like that, try this: Kevin and Catherine Dundon's Dunbrody House (dunbrodyhouse.com) has its own pub doing stonking wood-fired pizzas... and more besides. 16. Crowe's pork belly with Cashel blue cheese and plum sauce \n\nWhere: The Old Convent, Clogheen, Co Tipperary \nWhat: Dermot and Christine Gannon's Old Convent is one of the best-kept secrets in Irish food (and travel). Seven individually designed rooms just cry out for sneaky short breaks, the local walks are wild, and Dermot's eight-course Irish Artisan Tasting Menu is served in a former chapel. Dishes are a hymn to Tipperary, and the 12-hours slow-cooked pork belly is a triumph. Served with mature Cashel Blue cheese, poached pears from the garden and barbecue sauce from Traas Farm plums, it's hugely popular with diners. - PÓC \nHow much: Dinner from €65pp \nDetails: Mount Angelsby; 052 746 5565; theoldconvent.ie \nIf you like that, try this: Chez Hans ( chezhans.net ) may be one of Ireland's oldest restaurants, but it's still coming up trumps (as is its sister property, Café Hans). A new venture, Stef Hans, has opened in Thurles too. 17. Gubbeen pizza \n\nWhere: The Firehouse, Delgany, Co Wicklow \nWhat: \"It is important to play with your food…\" So began a recent Facebook post from Delgany's Firehouse Bakery. It's just one insight into why Patrick Ryan and Laura Moore's hub has won local hearts in jig time. Sourdough breads, sambos and pastries speak for themselves (the doughnuts have inspired a cult; the Wonka-esque éclairs soon will), but pizzas are the surprise treat. Emerging thin, crispy, yet gorgeously gooey from a glowing wood-fired oven, they're ridiculously good value for the price. Try the Gubbeen meat fest, with salami and chorizo hidden beneath the mozzarella and a clump of leaves… and change from a tenner, too. - PÓC \nHow much: €9.95 \nDetails: Old Delgany Inn; 01 287 6822; thefirehouse.ie \nIf you like that, try this: The Strawberry Tree at BrookLodge and Macreddin Village ( brooklodge.com ) puts wild Wicklow produce at the heart of its menu. 18. Irish Smoked Fish Platter \n\nWhere: The Winding Stair, Dublin 1 \nWhat: Restaurateur Elaine Murphy understands that when you source the best ingredients - like Stephen Kavanagh's Wicklow-smoked oyster pâté and smoked scallops, Terry Butterly's Annagassan smoked salmon, or Silver Darlings' pickled herring perhaps - little else can improve them. Simply add some house-made dillisk bread, pickled cucumbers and caper berries, along with a dollop of crème fraîche, and serve it up with a view of the Ha'penny Bridge that would bring a tear to Molly Malone's eye. - AC \nHow much: €13.95 \nDetails: 40 Lower Ormond Quay; 01 872 7320; winding-stair.com \nIf you like that, try this: Meet Me in the Morning ( facebook.com/meetmeinthemorningcafe ) at 50 Pleasants Street, Dublin 2, boasts a short menu featuring big flavours from some of Dublin's finest bakers and growers. 19. 'Flavours and textures of Irish milk and honey' \n\nWhere: Chapter One, Dublin 1 \nWhat: Patriotic gourmands flock to chef-proprietor Ross Lewis' gastronomic temple to pay homage to the very best of Irish produce. What better way to round off a superlative meal here than with pastry chef Darren Hogarty's 'Flavours and textures of Irish milk and honey', featuring Lannléire honey from award-winning fourth-generation beekeeper Eoghan Mac Giolla Coda of Co Louth. Poetic food, worthy of its literary location. - AC \nDetails: 18-19 Parnell Square; 01 8732266; chapteronerestaurant.com \nHow much: €75 for a four-course dinner (or try the three-course pre-theatre menu for €39.50) \nIf you like that, try this: Chef Graham Neville applies a light touch to his impeccably sourced ingredients at Restaurant FortyOne ( restaurantfortyone.ie ) at St Stephen's Green, some grown in the restaurant's own kitchen garden. 20. Fermented potato bread, bacon and cabbage \n\nWhere: Forest & Marcy, Dublin 4 \nWhat: If there was ever a dish that proclaimed Irish food's coming of age, it is chef Ciaran Sweeney's fermented potato bread, topped with sautéd cabbage and bacon and a dreamy bacon cream. It's not just that it confidently channels both a renaissance in age-old food-preservation techniques and our newfound curiosity for Irish food heritage; it's also the sheer deliciousness of a star dish at this groundbreaking wine bar and kitchen. - AC \nDetails: 126 Upper Leeson Street; 01 660 2480, forestandmarcy.ie \nHow much: €8 \nIf you like that, try this: Forest Avenue, 8-9 Sussex Terrace, Dublin 4 ( forest avenuerestaurant.ie ).Around the corner at Forest & Marcy's big sister, proprietors John and Sandy Weir run kitchen and floor with their own signature style. 21. Braised blade of beef \nWhere: Hartes of Kildare, Kildare Town \nWhat: Kildare does a killer line in gastropubs, with The Ballymore Inn, Fallons of Kilcullen and Hartes just three crying out for a detour. Barry Liscombe is head chef at Hartes, whose reputation is growing all the time, and one of his most popular dishes is the braised blade of beef - served with braised red cabbage and a Milleen's cheese and turnip puree. It's the perfect plate to arrange a Sunday or bank holiday around… just make sure you book in advance - PÓC \nHow much: €17 \nDetails: Market Square; 045 533 557; hartesbar.ie \nIf you like that, try this: The Ballymore Inn ( ballymoreinn.com ) always seems to be buzzing. Try Georgina O'Sullivan's cooking and you'll see why. 22. Warm terrine of rabbit and Horan's smoked ham hock \n\nWhere: The Fatted Calf, Athlone, Co Westmeath \nWhat: When Fiona and Feargal O'Donnell moved their restaurant from a Glasson pub to a glitzy town-centre space, I wondered if the special sauce would move with them. It has. Irish produce is key here - from Burren smokehouse mackerel to John Stone steaks. But whatever your order, make sure to include a dish that includes the word 'Horan's' (the butcher just two doors down). Head chef Dee Adamson works magic with its produce, as evidenced in this delicious menu staple: a ham hock smoked over applewood and served with spiced pineapple and winter squash from Lough Boora Organic Farm. - PÓC \nHow much: €8.95 \nDetails: Church Street; 090 643 3371; thefattedcalf.ie \nIf you like that, try this: John Coffey's Thyme ( thymerestaurant.ie ) takes local sourcing seriously, putting the Midlands on the menu. 23. Pan-roasted monkfish with parsnip crisps \n\nWhere: VM at Viewmount House, Longford \nWhat: Think of Longford, and seafood doesn't exactly spring to mind. After you eat at Gary O'Hanlon's VM, however, it will. O'Hanlon, together with Beryl and James Kearney of Viewmount House, have put Ireland's least-visited county on the tourism map, and the menu is an ode to local and Irish producers… often with surprising twists. On my latest visit, succulent strips of monkfish were garnished with parsnip crisps, green pepper salsa and a red curry splash. On another night, I was drawn by Clogherhead prawns and vodka-cured organic salmon. Complex, yet anchored and assured, I can't wait to see what he comes up with next. - PÓC \nHow much: Five-course dinner from €60 \nDetails: Dublin Road; 043 334 1919; viewmounthouse.com \nIf you like that, try this: Henry Stone and Stephanie Barillier's Sha-Roe Bistro in Clonegal, Co Carlow (053 937 5636) remains gloriously off radar, but it's always busy. Pay a visit and you'll become a convert. 24. Roast loin of venison \n\nWhere: Castle Leslie, Co Monaghan \nWhat: At the 2AA Rosette Snaffles Restaurant, head chef Andrew Bradley has built this dish around venison from the Castle Leslie Estate. It's served with locally grown sauerkraut and celeriac, as well as chestnut jelly and cranberry jam (and jus) from nuts and berries picked in Glaslough. A warning: the bar and restaurant's gin menu is a doozy, so make this one an overnight visit. Over the years, Castle Leslie has evolved into a peachy Blue Book property… and it's not done yet. - PÓC \nHow much: Dinner costs €65 \nDetails: Glaslough; 047 88100; castleleslie.com \nIf you like that, try this: Conor Mee and Charlotte Carr's Courthouse Restaurant ( courthouserestaurant.ie ) in Carrickmacross… a touch of Monaghan magic. 25. Tom Doherty's Black Pudding and Clogherhead Crab \n\nWhere: Vanilla Pod, Kells, Co Meath \nWhat: Hotelier, restaurateur, farmer and Fáilte Ireland Food Champion Olivia Duff is the trail- blazer behind the excellent Boyne Valley Food Series (boynevalleyfoodseries.ie), which fosters collaborations between food producers and chefs throughout Meath and Louth. Besides its central series of unique events, the initiative highlights 'Place on a Plate' dishes on local menus, such as craft butcher Tom Doherty's award-winning black pudding and 'Clogherhead crab with a crab and apple cigar' at Duff's Vanilla Pod restaurant. The Boyne Valley isn't all about ancient history, you know. - AC \nDetails: Headfort Arms Hotel, Headfort Place; 046 924 0063; headfortarms.ie \nHow much: €9.95 \nIf you like that, try this: Jeni Glasgow and Reuven Diaz bring a cosmopolitan sensibility to great local produce at Eastern Seaboard ( glasgow-diaz.com ) in Bryanstown, Drogheda. 26. Thornhill Duck \n\nWhere: MacNean House & Restaurant, Blacklion, Co Cavan \nWhat: This year, we asked you to nominate Ireland's favourite foodie experience in our first Reader Travel Awards. MacNean House & Restaurant won by a mile. Neven Maguire's mothership is by now a cornerstone of fine Irish dining, and it's tough reducing such an accomplished menu to one dish. The assiette of Thornhill duck does the trick, however. An 'assiette' sees the same central ingredient prepared in different ways, and here Maguire gives a local farmer's birds the royal treatment in a mini-symphony of seared pink breast, confit leg spring roll and a wee twist of quinoa. Pace yourself, though… it's one of 12 courses. - PÓC \nHow much: €85pp (Prestige tasting menu) \nDetails: 071 985 3022; nevenmaguire.com \nWhile you're at it: Gearóid and Tara Lynch's Olde Post Inn ( theoldepostinn.com ) in Cloverhill is rapidly developing a destination dining culture of its own. Gearóid is a pioneer with gluten-free cooking in Ireland, so coeliacs will be in heaven. 27. Scallop with coral butter and sea herbs \n\nWhere: Ox Belfast \nWhat: Ox can claim to have kick-started Belfast's foodie revolution, and its tasting menus continue to be one of the must-do meals in town. Local provenance is an art form here, with scallop (or turbot) landed in Greencastle, Co Donegal, and sprinkled with the pixie dust of sea spinach, radish or lettuce foraged from Helen's Bay and delivered within hours to the kitchen. Castlebar's Cuinneog butter adds to a plate that is simple and divine… and it's just one of eight courses on your journey. - PÓC \nHow much: Tasting menus from £50/€59. \nDetails: 1 Oxford Street; 048 9031 4121; oxbelfast.com \nWhile you're at it: The Japanese-style oysters or salt and chilli squid at Mourne Seafood ( mourneseafood.com ) are snacky seafood at its best. 28. Glebe Wagyu Beef Burger \n\nWhere: Pyke 'N' Pommes, Foyle Marina, Derry \nWhat: Kevin Pyke is famous for running Northern Ireland's No 1 food truck. Now he's also running a 'POD' - a foodie pit stop fashioned from a funky shipping container - and the kitchen at Derry's Blackbird pub. Try the Glebe Wagyu beef burger and you'll have your eureka moment. From a small but perfectly formed sandwich board menu that could just as easily be served in a restaurant, this combines the beef patty with cheese, tomato, pickled onions, 'soft leaves', honey mayo and a toasted brioche bun. Tacos and wraps are on the menu too. Sublime Northern Irish street food. - PÓC \nHow much? £6.50/€7.50 (or with fries for £7.50) \nDetails: Foyleview; facebook.com/PykeNPommes \nIf you like that, try this: Browns is the perfect counterpoint to Pyke 'N' Pommes, a legen-Derry restaurant with chef Phelim O'Hagan at the helm (brownsrestaurant.com). Try his turf-smoked beef. 29. Buttermilk-battered Greencastle fish and chips \n\nWhere: Harry's, Craft Village, Derry \nWhat: Chef Derek Creagh's saltwater-cured haddock fillet is sourced from day boats in nearby Greencastle, cooked to perfection in buttermilk batter and served with classic mushy peas and chips. This quintessential modern Irish fish-and-chips dish is worth a special Sunday pilgrimage to Donal Doherty's no-frills roadside restaurant in Bridgend in Inishowen, Co Donegal, or to the new Harry's Derry, in the city's Craft Village, through the week.
