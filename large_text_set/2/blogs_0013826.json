I used white cheddar (I don't used foods colored with Annatto) and frozen corn and frozen peas, thawed (instead of canned corn and frozen green beans). My grown sons each took home half a casserole . A definite keeper!\" MY REVIEW dawnrosanne User ID: 1014810 222511 Reviewed Mar. 10, 2015 \n\"Excellent! I just made one casserole instead of two, so I cut the recipe in half. I still used 2 cans of soup though. I also added 1 TB of worcestshire sauce.\" MY REVIEW Lehde User ID: 7068457 178543 Reviewed Sep. 18, 2013 \n\"Fantastic, freezes well and lends itself to easy adaptations with different spices.\" MY REVIEW nancy headlee User ID: 5479331 116653 Reviewed May. 2, 2012 \n\"This was great! I made a couple of changes as well. Instead of cayenne pepper, I used pepper jack cheese. We don't like frozen beans so I used 1 can whole kernal corn, 1 cream style and a large can of mushrooms. Yum! Thank you for a really good new favorite.\" MY REVIEW jstoltz User ID: 3178346 132333 Reviewed Mar. 5, 2012 \n\"The family loved this. I used cream of mushroom soup because that is what I had on hand. Also halved the recipe just to make 1 casserole .\" MY REVIEW kerschc User ID: 2601335 212425 Reviewed Dec. 23, 2011", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:17:56.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
