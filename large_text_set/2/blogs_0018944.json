This has led to a massive community growing around the mobile gaming scene with game developers and hardware manufacturers working hand-in-hand to deliver smartphones which can handle graphically intensive titles without breaking into a sweat.However, similar to a computer, a smartphone comes with different classes of processors and GPUs and a user doesn’t need to invest in the most expensive SoC to play games on high settings. This is where Honor’s recently-launched budget smartphone the Honor 6X comes in. With the 4GB variant retailing for just Rs 15,999, the 6X boasts great specs which is why, we decided to put it through its paces in our gaming overview to see just how good it is. An enriching gaming experience depends on the size and the resolution of the display. You’ll be glad to know that the Honor 6X comes boasting a 5.5-inch display which rocks a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (full HD). Underneath its metal chassis, the Honor 6X comes equipped with a Kirin 655 processor which has eight physical cores clocked at 2.1GHz. The graphics are handled by a Mali-T830 MP2 GPU. A 3,340mAh battery ensures that the Honor 6X doesn’t die on you during an important boss battle. Now that we have the core specs out of the way, let’s see how the smartphone performs in real-world usage. \nThe first game we tested on the Honor 6X was Riptide GP2 . We ran the game on the highest possible settings and the game ran butter-smooth. All the water splashes and ripples were rendering properly and we didn’t run into any lags or stutters after 15 minutes of continuous gaming. Next, we downloaded Asphalt 8 on the smartphone, upped the settings to the max and jumped into a race, considering the fact that Asphalt 8 is a much more demanding game than Riptide GP2 . However, the Honor 6X managed to push decent framerates during the entire race. From the screen-cracking animations to the insane drifts, we didn’t come across any major lag during the gameplay. There were some minor hiccups here and there but nothing too prominent. Craving some FPS action, we installed UNKILLED on the Honor 6X which involves killing hordes of zombies using a variety of weapons. Even during intense action sequences, the Honor 6X held its own. While we were thoroughly satisfied with the 6X’s gaming performance, we’d also like to shine the light on its brilliant heat management. Even after gaming on the smartphone for a substantial amount of time, the Honor 6X didn’t overheat and just felt slightly warm to the touch. Although the USP of the Honor 6X is its dual-camera setup on the back, the smartphone managed to wow us with its gaming performance too.
