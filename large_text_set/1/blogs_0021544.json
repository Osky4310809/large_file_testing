Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images   06.31   06.33   \n“Justice takes time, and justice takes money”: that was my instructor’s mantra when I was training to be a police detective, 15 years ago. \nToday I’m a senior officer and that mantra sticks with me. When a crime is committed, officers like me painstakingly make their way through piles of evidence. The bill for forensic examination of that evidence can rack up to tens of thousands of pounds, and it all takes time. My police force is struggling to conceal the fact that it's sinking Read more \nEven in the most straightforward cases, it’s not unusual for in excess of 40 items of evidence to be seized. We have raided homes of suspected paedophiles where the computers, phones and media we seize have resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of work. \nWe have found stolen goods in a car with no registered keeper, following a series of burglaries. Nearby, a man was arrested and a gun found in his home. He denied being in the car and it took time for detailed forensics to prove his association with the car, the stolen goods and therefore the burglaries. \nThe coalition government closed the state-run Forensic Science Service in 2012, so forensic examinations are now outsourced to private companies and savage cuts mean money to pay for the work is in short supply. We could pay to fast track every forensic sample and get the results back in two days but we would run out of money within a month and I doubt if the forensic laboratories could cope if everything became urgent. \nFor the moment, we still do have time to carry out our work. But I worry that the policing and crime bill could jeopardise even that, by piling yet more bureaucracy into investigations. \nThe bill says an inspector must authorise every police bail. Police bail – or pre-charge bail as it is also known – is granted to individuals arrested on suspicion of a criminal offence, where there is not enough evidence to charge them and more investigation is required. Do MPs really imagine we can​could​ finish an investigation into a rapist or internet paedophile in just 28 days? \nThis will be burdensome to say the least. The number of inspectors has plummeted during the past six years, in an attempt to keep as many constables on the frontline as possible. There are many times when there is only one inspector (and no one more senior) working in an entire county. If they are busy, perhaps dealing with a serious incident, one can only assume the suspect has to wait in a cell until an inspector becomes available. \nThe bill seeks to limit police bail to 28 days. I think that the current process of open-ended police bail is a bad thing, but any detective will tell you that they will not be able to resolve their cases within 28 days. I would argue that a six-month police bail period would be a more reasonable amount of time to give us to make a charge. \nTake the case of a man arrested on suspicion of rape. He will probably be released on police bail because we need forensics to charge him and these are likely to take several months. We need to put a file before a lawyer from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in order to charge the suspect. The CPS has been subject to cuts since 2010 and its lawyers are overwhelmed with work, just like us. Crown Prosecution Service chief inspector signals concern over funding Read more \nCurrently, once we have finished our investigation we expect to wait three months for the CPS to make a decision on whether to charge. Under this new bill, we will need to jump through lots of hoops in order to keep a suspect on bail long enough to be able to make a charge. The man in the cells suspected of rape would likely be released without police bail, only to be rearrested if further evidence comes to light. \nWithout doubt, this bill will mean fewer people are arrested. Instead the police will take the option of asking suspects to attend interviews voluntarily rather than go through the rigmarole of arresting someone, processing bail and then trying to charge them against the 28-day clock. \nIt also means alleged victims do not benefit from the conditions that can be added to bail – such as a ban on contact with alleged victims or witnesses – which is so important where victims are vulnerable. \nDo MPs really imagine we can finish an investigation into a rapist or internet paedophile in just 28 days? \nThe bill is soon to become an act, and I fear that justice will now have less time, as well as less money. \nThis series aims to give a voice to the staff behind the public services that are hit by mounting cuts and rising demand, and so often denigrated by the press, politicians and public.
