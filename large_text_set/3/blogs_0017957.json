Not only is this the most self-aggrandizing form of \"cultural appropriation\" imaginable, it is also - not even by inference, but directly and insultingly - anti-Semitic. It trivializes the unspeakable horror Jews and millions of others went through then.\nThe original \" Résistance \" began in June 1940 when Nazi Germany defeated France and took over that country, installing a puppet government (Vichy). This, on the face of it, makes any comparison to the presidency of Donald Trump, who was duly elected, absurd, but let's add just a few facts. At the outset, mid-1940, buildings throughout France were renamed, books banned, art stolen and taken to Germany and people disappeared. (A number of Germans and Austrians had escaped to France in the 1930s. Too bad for them.) Further, in October of that year, under the statut des Juifs, Jews were forbidden to practice the professions - law, medicine, etc.- and Jewish-owned businesses confiscated and placed under \"Aryan\" control. The Jews were also banned from public places such as cinemas, museums and parks and only allowed to ride on the last carriage of the Paris metro. Mandatory armbands followed shortly thereafter.\nHas any of that - anything remotely like that - happened here under the new administration?\nOf course, things in France then got a lot worse fast:\nThe Drancy camp [near Paris] was designed to hold 700 people, but at its peak held more than 7,000. There is documented evidence and testimony recounting the brutality of the French guards in Drancy and the harsh conditions imposed on the inmates. For example, upon their arrival, small children were immediately separated from their parents for deportation to the death camps.[4]\nOn 6 April 1944, SS First Lieutenant Klaus Barbie raided a children's home in Izieu, France, where Jewish children had been hidden. Barbie arrested everyone present, all 44 children and 7 adult staff members. The next day, the Gestapo transported the arrestees to Drancy. From there, all the children and staff were deported to Auschwitz. None of them survived.[4]\nMany French Jewish intellectuals and artists were held in Drancy, including Max Jacob (who died there), Tristan Bernard, and the choreographer René Blum. Of the 75,000 Jews whom French and German authorities deported from France, more than 67,000 were sent directly from Drancy to Auschwitz.[4]\nAs most literate people know - well, some anyway - it didn't get better from there. In all this there were brave people like the legendary Maquis guerrilla fighters who battled the Nazis in rural France as well as numerous collaborators who, hopefully, are rotting in Hell. This real \" Resistance \" - this life and death struggle between good and evil - was going on all over the Continent while the ghastly \"Final Solution\" played out in the background.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/rogerlsimon/2017/03/18/lefts-use-of-term-resistance-to-oppose-trump-is-appalling-and-anti-semitic/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maquis_(World_War_II)", "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/democrats-resistance-extremists-tea-party-democracy-214906", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drancy_internment_camp"], "published": "2017-03-19T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T07:16:35.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
