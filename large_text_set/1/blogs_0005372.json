(Photo: Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports) \nATLANTA — The Atlanta Falcons sure know how to throw a goodbye party. \nMatt Ryan bolstered his case for MVP with four touchdowns passes in the first half, and Atlanta locked up a first-round bye with a 38-32 victory over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday in the last regular-season game at the Georgia Dome. \nAtlanta is moving into the Mercedes-Benz Stadium next season after 25 years in the Georgia Dome. But it will host at least one more game in its old house – its first postseason appearance in three years, no less – and an ad for playoff tickets drew big cheers when it appeared on the video boards early in the fourth quarter. \nKnowing a win got them a week off, the Falcons were a model of efficiency in the first half. They scored touchdowns on all five possessions, gaining 323 yards on 28 plays. Ryan threw TD passes to four different receivers – Tevin Coleman, Julio Jones, Mohamed Sanu and Justin Hardy – with Devonta Freeman breaking free for a 75-yard scoring run for the other score. \nThe Falcons were finally forced to punt on the opening drive of the second half before adding a field goal to complete the scoring. \nRyan was 17 of 19 for 235 yards in the first half, and chants of “M-V-P! M-V-P!” echoed throughout the Georgia Dome after the last two scoring drives. He finished the day 27 of 36 for 331 yards. \nFollow Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour . \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 17 Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
