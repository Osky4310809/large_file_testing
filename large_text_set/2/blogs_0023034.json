We've been working closely with the leadership in the House and the Senate and we're looking at a combined plan,\" he told CNBC in his first television interview since assuming office. \nMnuchin said the administration is \"primarily focused on a middle income tax cut and a simplification for business.\" He reiterated what he told CNBC in November that he is focused on any tax cuts for the wealthy getting canceled out with closed loopholes. \nThe new Treasury secretary also said the administration still aims for \"sustainable growth of 3 percent or more.\" He said he expects to hit that mark more toward the end of next year. \nHe also addressed so-called border adjustment, a key provision of the House Republican tax plan. He said that \"we're looking at it,\" noting that the plan has \"interesting aspects\" but also said \"there are some concerns.\" \nThis is a breaking news story.
