Photo: NIC WALKER \nBecky Lucas In an episode of ABC-TV's recent comedy series Fancy Boy , Becky Lucas managed to steal the show playing the wife of a political candidate campaigning to raise the legal age of buggery to 25. Her performance was not showy but she turned Tracey Phillips, partner of Len, played by Greg Larsen, into a subtly simmering realist who finally quit the madness. Lucas, who wrote for Please Like Me and led ABC2 documentary Big Bad Love about domestic violence, will deliver sharp, self-critiquing stand-up in festival show Little Bitch with a frankness that takes the breath away. \nFrida Deguise Deguise is billed as the only Australian stand-up wearing a hijab onstage and it is an important part of her show. First, it helps \"hide the explosives\" she says. \"People always ask, 'Frida, why have you got it on? Were you forced? Were you pressured? Were you bashed?' It's really simple. I'm just having a really bad hair day.\" After six years performing live comedy, all while designing evening wear and formal gowns, Deguise deflects prejudice with bold, uncensored quippery. Her show AKA Wogan explores being Australian, a Muslim, a mum and having the knack of marrying three different Lebanese mechanics. \"Some women marry for love. I marry for car repair.\" \nJoe Lycett British comic Joe Lycett is a deliciously shrewd stand-up, bon vivant humanitarian and the creator of some of the most beautifully absurd and anarchist email exchanges with parking fine administrators, office building managers and online scam operators, around. His emailed argument with City of York Council over a parking ticket is revolutionary in its sound-minded ridiculousness. His show That's the Way Aha Aha, Joe Lycett he may detail how his anti-authoritarianism has extended to Donald Trump whom Lycett attempted to bring down by booking 500 Syrian refugees, as \"a large group\", into as many Trump Hotels as possible. One hotel manager declined, specifying room guest restrictions but not before Lycett's always affable efforts to annoy were heard. \n\"What is the capacity of those rooms do you think?\" he wrote. \"Looking at the photographs I reckon I could get three people on the bed, maybe another two on the floor around the bed, then about six people in the living area. It'll be cosy but it'll work! Advertisement \n\"So if we say 11 people per room, across 27 rooms, that's space for 297?\" \nMitch Garling Mitch Garling calls himself a man-child, a 28-year-old adapting to adult life via a hearty reluctance to do so. \"Life,\" he says, \"is just not as good as being a child.\" Take his dreams for example. When he was 10 he dreamed that he and his dad held up a Red Rooster. \"That's an amazing dream,\" he says. \"I had a dream recently that Jan, the old lady at work, left her printer code logged in. So then I could print whatever I wanted to ... That was the highlight of my dream.\" His world-weariness blooms further in Reluctance to Adult where he might tell you about Blu-Tacking his broken fly together minutes before going on stage. \nAlex Jae In Paige Hally & Alex Jae Are Garbage , two emerging comics mine self-deprecation with a passion verging on life philosophy. \"We don't think we're awesome, and we're happy to tell you,\" Jae says. In a world full of people curating their career brilliance, personal grooming and adorable errors in social media and beyond, emerging comics Jae and Hally bare their shortcomings with unfiltered chutzpah. \nPeter and Bambi Heaven Dance and magic power couple Peter and Bambi Heaven merge high-end exotic dancing, master illusion and extremely tight, sequinned outfits in The Magic Inside, a celebration of delusion and unrestrained sexual attraction. And dancing. This spectacle of wardrobe malfunction, '80s soft rock, overblown stage conjuring and artistically libidinous gyrating is a smart and beautifully concocted spoof by Asher Treleaven, comic, and Gypsy Wood, burlesque performer, who, in real-life, created the show a year ago while amicably divorcing. \nOther-might-not-knows-but-must-sees Rose Matafeo – Sassy Best Friend , Sami Shah – Punching Down, Bart Freebairn – Maximum Delicious, Anne Klinge – The Foot Murder (& Other Tales) , Nick Sun – You Don't have To Be Anything!
