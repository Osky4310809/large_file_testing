On a play that tied the game for Italy in the ninth inning, Italy actually went for the walk-off win, but Drew Butera was thrown out at home to send the game to extra innings. \nOn the play at the plate, Venezuela catcher Salvador Perez took a shot to the knee that caused him to leave the game. And he actually needed help getting off the field and down to the clubhouse. \nHere’s an internet grab thanks to Twitter user @jeremyscheuch: Drew Butera taking out Salvador Perez. Yikes. pic.twitter.com/um1nn5dLO9 — Jeremy Scheuch (@jeremyscheuch) March 12, 2017 \nIt’s possible that’s nothing, but it could also be a very serious knee injury. We’ll have to wait and see on this one. \nNeedless to say, this goes beyond the scope of the World Baseball Classic. Perez is a very valuable member of the Royals and he carries one of the heaviest behind-the-plate loads in baseball, having logged at least 126 starts and 1100 innings at catcher in each of the last four seasons. \nOh, by the way, guess who Perez’s backup on the Royals is? Drew Butera. \nCue the baseless conspiracy theories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T03:42:15.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
