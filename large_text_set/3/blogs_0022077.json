But it's LaVar who's stolen the show repeatedly in recent weeks through his boasts. \nLaVar said he could've beat Michael Jordan one-on-one back in the day. LaVar said he wants a billion-dollar shoe deal for his three sons (LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball will follow Lonzo to UCLA). LaVar has been roasted on Twitter for his bragging ways, repeatedly. \nBut it's a recent bit of bloviation that has LeBron ticked off. \n\"Keep my kids' name out of your mouth, keep my family out of your mouth,\" James told ESPN.com on Tuesday. \"This is dad to dad. It's a problem now.\"\nWhat exactly has the best basketball player on Earth so perturbed? LaVar discussed James' sons, 12-year-old LeBron James Jr. and 9-year-old Bryce Maximus James, during a recent appearance on a podcast called \"In the Zone with Chris Broussard\".\nSaid LaVar to Broussard earlier this March :\nYou got LeBron, it’s gonna be so hard for his kids, cause they gonna look at them like ‘you gotta be just like your dad. And after a while that pressure starts sitting on you like ‘why do I gotta be like him, why can’t I just be me?’ And then they’re gonna be like ‘aw, you’re soft, you’re not that good.’ Because the expectation is very, very high. \nThat seemed at the time like a needlessly specific reference to James' kids, who've become internet sensations in the youth basketball scene. \nThose waiting for a response from James now need wait no more. \n\"He can talk all about his brand, talk about his sons, talk about basketball, talk about me,\" James told ESPN on Tuesday. \"But keep my family out of this.\"\nWATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:57:29.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
