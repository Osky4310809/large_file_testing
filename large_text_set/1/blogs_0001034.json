Once they have been sprouted and shelled, they can be roasted to give a tasty and nutritional boost. \nWatermelon seeds are packed with protein, vitamin B, Â­magnesium and Â­monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Sprinkle them on your salad for an added crunch. \nMaca \nMaca is a root, which belongs to the radish family, rich in vitamins and is said to boost your sex drive and improve stamina. \nCommonly found in powder form, it is also said to help your mood and general wellbeing. Add a teaspoon to a smoothie or protein shake. \nActivated charcoal \nFrom centuries, activated charcoal has been used for as a detoxifier. Try it as a pitch black drink or add some powdered charcoal tablets to your beauty regime for clearer skin. \nIt is even used to whiten teeth as it is meant to absorb tannins found in coffee and red wine. \nProbiotic water \nProbiotics are useful live bacteria and yeasts that are often found in Â­yoghurts and Â­supplements. But probiotic water is being hailed as the latest way to help our guts. \nFood and drink are becoming functional - this is an example of how we can get the goodness of water with the added health benefits of probiotics.\" \nTiger nuts \nTiger nuts are small wrinkled root Â­vegetables hailing from North Africa and the Med. Low in Â­calories and fat, they are a great source of potassium, vitamin E, iron and unsaturated fatty acids. \nEnjoy them whole as a snack or make traditional creamy drink horchata by soaking them before blending with water and a dash of sweetener. \nGoat meat \nGoat meat is commonly eaten in North Africa but it's going to be big news in 2017 here, too. \n\"It's a healthy Â­option - low in fat and higher in Â­protein than some meats - and it's also higher in iron than beef, pork or lamb,\" said Nutritionist Lily Soutter. \n\"Currently, goats are farmed primarily for their milk and so - shockingly - most male goats from the goat dairy industry are killed at birth,\" Soutter added. \n(With ANI inputs) First Published: Sunday, January 1, 2017 - 23:18 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T03:26:38.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
