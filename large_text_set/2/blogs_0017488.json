The mayor of Flavortown is a ubiquitous presence at NBA All-Star Weekend. It is seemingly impossible to walk into a building and not see those frosted tips across the room, either courtside or in a VIP section. \nMy first Fieri sighting of the weekend came at the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game on Friday night. Fieri emerged from the back by the locker rooms and strolled by the NBA TV set to take his seats to watch Master P , Nick Cannon and fellow chef and Food Network star Aarón Sánchez play . \nHowever, Fieri wasn’t done after the celebrity game. The man was everywhere on All-Star Weekend. He took in Kenny Smith’s All-Star party on Friday night. \n#JBLxNBA #KennySmithAllStar the party last night was seriously awesome! I was so excited to meet my idol @GuyFieri pic.twitter.com/VecY1mu04B \n— GK Photography (@gkphotography1) February 18, 2017 \n\n\nHe was spotted twice at the All-Star Saturday Night festivities. First, fist-pumping during the introductions for the skills competition. \nTNT\nLater, he was sitting courtside with Fat Joe, because why wouldn’t Guy Fieri be friends with Fat Joe. \n@ barstoolsports crucial Guy Fieri picture in picture option for All Star Saturday Night https://t.co/IIOo0m5qSP — \nThe Dan McCrory (@dmaculate47) February 19, 2017 \n\nFieri’s night was just getting started, as he was at the Beats by Dre party, not just as a guy with an invite, but my man was on the back of the stage rocking out for the Hot Boys reunion, while LeBron James , 2 Chainz, his buddy Fat Joe and more were on stage. \nGuy Fieri on stage with the Hot Boys pic.twitter.com/AqRUZUJheY \n— Alexis Morgan (@alexiskmorgan) February 19, 2017 \n\nOn Sunday, Fieri was back at it courtside for the All-Star game and hung out with QuestLove before their pre-game set. \n\nAnd don’t get it twisted, Fieri’s not some buster who says he’s “courtside” when he’s four rows back. Fieri’s out here with the feet on the floor seats for him and his two sons..\nGetty Image\n\nFieri wrapped his All-Star Weekend by finding himself in the VIP of another All-Star party, this time hanging out in the VIP section with 2 Chainz and Wale.\n\nThe artist formerly known as Tity Boi and Fieri also happened to take my favorite picture of the weekend because I imagine Fieri singing 2 Chainz verse,”They say I’m crazy. I used to talk to the stove. I used to tell it to lock. I used to tell it a lot. Go to the dealership. Fishtail off the lot!” \n\nWhat we learned this weekend in New Orleans is that Guy Fieri is a star among All-Stars, and if there’s a party, he will find it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:51:37.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
