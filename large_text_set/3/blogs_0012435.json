And if there’s two things we love, it’s summer and Selena Gomez.\nWhich is why we’re totally vibing Gomez’s Vogue cover pic . The April issue features our girl in a brightly-colored Michael Kors Collection bralette , accompanied by Jennifer Fisher hoop earrings and a ’60s-inspired cat eye. We can’t make out the bottom half of her ensemble, but sources tell us it’s a matching Michael Kors skirt from the same collection.\nGomez looks directly at the camera while holding up her hair. It’s sexy, sophisticated, and oh-so-summer! But enough talk, let’s take a look.\nA post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine) on Mar 16, 2017 at 4:01am PDT \nWE LOVE!\nThis is Gomez’s first American Vogue cover (she’s appeared on Vogue Brazil though), and it follows up a year of noteworthy fashion moments — like when she appeared in a Louis Vuitton campaign photographed by Bruce Webber.\nvia GIPHY \nThe rest of the photo shoot features even more summer-inspired looks, with more floral ensembles and several retro bathing suit shots. And as if a rocking photo shoot wasn’t enough, the actual interview with Gomez is noteworthy in and of itself. She speaks candidly about her experiences with rehab, rigorous therapy sessions, and the havoc Instagram reeked on her mental health.\nIt’s an absolute must-read for any Gomez fan (or, really, just anybody in general who has ever struggled with mental health). You can read the full interview here .\nThanks for being so real with us, Selena. And of course, thank you for getting us so entirely stoked for summer. Seriously — is it too early to go bathing suit shopping?
