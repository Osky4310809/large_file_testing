After the alleged gang rape, it is understood that the girl sought help and gardaí were then notified of the incident. \nA major investigation involving officers based in the Midlands then took place and CCTV footage was gathered and studied. \nForensic and other evidence was obtained by gardaí. \nIt is understood that when all this evidence was gathered, senior officers decided to make the arrests this week. \nThe suspects - one 17-year-old, two 20-year-olds and two 19-year-olds - were all picked up by gardaí on Wednesday and questioned at different stations in the Midlands before being released without charge yesterday evening. \nThey all live in the Midlands area and were not previously known for this type of offence. \nThe Central Statistics Office (CSO) said last year gardaí recorded 2,442 sex offences - a rise of 13pc in the 12 months from June 2015 to June 2016.
