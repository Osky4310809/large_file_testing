You’re going to sneeze, is that it?\" Ryan asked.\nMarshall later said his son would be punished for disrupting the photo.\nJust so you know @SpeakerRyan : He's grounded. https://t.co/PGGhYXEfQv\n— Dr. Roger Marshall (@RogerMarshallMD) January 3, 2017 After a long day of swearing in new members of Congress, Ryan was still perplexed by the dab.\nJust finished swearing-in photos.
