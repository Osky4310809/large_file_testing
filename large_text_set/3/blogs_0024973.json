Right from the time in 2013 when Modi was planning to take centre stage in national politics, he had placed Purvanchal at the core of his campaign strategy. The Modi-Shah duo giving UP a chief minister from Purvanchal after 29 years was just an extension of the same blueprint.\nThe Janata Dal government led by VP Singh implemented the Mandal Commission which recommended 27% reservation for OBC candidates in 1990 which led to a momentous shift in national politics. The reverberation was felt in UP as well which saw the emergence of OBC politics led by the likes of Kalyan Singh and Mulayam Singh. When the alliance between Mulayam’s Samajwadi Party and Kanshiram’s BSP fell through in 1995, the state saw the rise of Dalit leader Mayawati. Incidentally, all three (Kalyan, Mulayam and Mayawati) leaders belonged to western UP.\n'Yogi will be an unorthodox CM' https://t.co/riJ2j7BVGV\n— TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) March 23, 2017\nThe last time a Purvanchali held the post of chief minister was Congress strongman Vir Bahadur Singh (1985-88). The period between Singh and Yogi has seen as many as 13 CMs representing other regions of the state. During this time, Purvanchal lagged behind economically and became infamous for mafia-raj due to the likes of Harishankar Tiwari, Ramakant Yadav, Brajesh Singh and Mukhtar Ansari among others. This was one of the many reasons why Modi chose to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Varanasi which provided the perfect blend of Hindutva and Purvanchal.\nGorakhpur began celebrating since early evening. MP from here @yogi_adityanath is new #UPCM @timesofindia pic.twitter.com/lWpGogM5f9\n— TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) March 18, 2017\nModi put his personal popularity on the line when he spent three days in Varanasi during the 2017 assembly election campaign. He was rewarded with 77 out of the 101 seats in 17 districts of Azamgarh, Ballia, Basti, Chandauli, Deoria, Ghazipur, Gorakhpur, Jaunpur, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Mau, Mirzapur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Sant Ravidas Nagar, Siddharth Nagar, Sonbhadra and Varanasi. There are 10 members from Purvanchal in Yogi’s council of ministers as well. After nearly three decades, Purvanchal seems to have found its place in the sun.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/timesofindia", "https://twitter.com/TOILucknow/status/844763265997582336", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/UPCM?src=hash", "https://t.co/riJ2j7BVGV", "https://t.co/lWpGogM5f9", "https://twitter.com/yogi_adityanath", "https://twitter.com/TOILucknow/status/843099335801815040"], "published": "2017-03-23T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:53:29.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
