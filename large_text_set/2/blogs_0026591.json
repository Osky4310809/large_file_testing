Brooks and those like him, on the other hand, seemingly imagined something else altogether. \n“Social media companies now regularly have procedures their users can follow where it is alleged a hate crime may have taken place,” he added in his evidence to Parliament, before launching into a diatribe about how these policies need to be enhanced. \nBut what in the world do social media have to do with hate crimes? A lot, unfortunately. Last August, for instance, a man from Manchester was sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid work and a year of “community order” (basically probation) for merely writing something on Facebook that offended Muslims, as reported at the time by the Manchester Evening News .   \nOne Muslim “witness” reportedly told police that she was concerned that his comments (which did not threaten violence) would somehow “incite hatred,” and apparently the authorities bought it. \nThis means that merely posting comments or updates to Facebook that might offend Muslims or any other minorities now counts as a “hate crime” in the U.K., and that’s a problem. \nReal bigots are the scourge of society, and targeting them for ostracism could perhaps be a legitimate form of deterrence. But until the British learn to differentiate between someone committing an actual hate crime and someone simply engaging in free speech, no matter how offensive, they need to cool their jets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:47:23.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
