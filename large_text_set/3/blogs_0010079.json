Taking to Twitter, Minaj revealed that she has \"created something super dope\" for the platform, which will arrive sometime between now and Monday. Just created smthn super dope for Tidal. Hope u guys are all signed up. üëÖ ‚Äî NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) March 11, 2017 Anytime between now & Monday. But there r lots of other things you'll start to miss out on if you don't have #Tidal ijs ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è https://t.co/Fd7TTihaHc ‚Äî NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) March 11, 2017 \nSeeing as she already gave us so much music this week, it seems more likely that this release will be a video or interview of some sort. A visual for her \"No Frauds\" diss track with Lil Wayne and Drake would surely get people talking. If you don't currently have Tidal, this may be the time to subscribe, or at least grab a free trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:43:23.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
