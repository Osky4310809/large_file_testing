TMZ Sports passed along details of the video, which shows Hardy being cooperative with officers after they found cocaine in his wallet in September. He said he just reached a new NFL deal and stated somebody must have planted the drugs: \nI just got a job, I play football. I was at a party. I got drunk. Literally last night...I was at a mixer with NFL guys trying to do an interview. Like I said, I don't know what happened between me and him, he could've slipped stuff in my pocket. Some people offered me some stuff...I literally don't know what is in that. Whatever it is. I haven't even seen it. I thought that I had nothing in the car. Police on scene had a conversation about handling the situation carefully. \"He's very big and fit\" and \"we have to not stir anything up\" were among the comments, per TMZ Sports. Hardy never ended up signing with an NFL team last season. He appeared in 12 games for the Cowboys in 2015, tallying 35 combined tackles, six sacks and an interception. He's played in 75 career games with Dallas and the Carolina Panthers since getting drafted in 2010. The 28-year-old Tennessee native received a 10-game suspension from the league in 2015 for a domestic violence incident involving an ex-girlfriend. The ban was later reduced to four games and the charges were dismissed before an appeal trial. Fox 4 noted he reached a plea agreement in the cocaine case to reduce the charges from a felony to a \"misdemeanor with some strict conditions\" to avoid prison time.
