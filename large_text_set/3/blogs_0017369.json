Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWilly Caballero has admitted that he was shocked when Pep Guardiola told Joe Hart he had no future at Manchester City. \nBut the City keeper would love to see the England No.1 back in the Premier League next season. \nCaballero and Hart became close friends in the two years they worked together at the Etihad, but when Guardiola recruited £17million Claudio Bravo from Barcelona the Englishman was sent on loan to Torino. \nCaballero said: “I assume it was a hard decision for Pep - and of course for Joe to move. Joe gave fantastic performances over the last two seasons and has a long history with the City shirt. \n“I have to be honest, Joe Hart was incredible. He made lots of saves. He gave us lots of points…and then we started the season without him and with Claudio.

We had to adapt because the season was ready to start and you know the boss is the boss. \n“We know him now, that he is really demanding, but it is all to try and achieve the best performance for every single player. \n“But of course, I would like to see Joe play in the Premier League. \n“He is my friend and he will always be my friend because he is a great person and a great keeper. Hart is enjoying his time in Italy (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \n“We still talk. When I play for City I know he is watching and I always try to watch Joe when he is playing in Torino. \n“We trained together in the two weeks before he decided to go to Torino and we spoke a lot about the situation. \n“I tried to help him as a friend, as he helped me as a friend, and I will never forget that.” \n* Willy Caballero was speaking at the launch of Manchester City's partnership with Nexen Tire — the first Premier League club sleeve partnership to be announced.
