Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJose Mourinho has urged Manchester United players and fans to raise their game for Sunday’s showdown with Liverpool. \nMourinho was bitterly disappointed with his team’s flat display and the equally flat atmosphere at Old Trafford before goals from Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini put the Reds on course for the EFL Cup final at Wembley. \nThe United boss said everyone, including himself, must do better against fierce rivals Liverpool. \n“The players have to do better, I have to do better, and the fans have to do better,” he said.

If we play very well, if we play with enthusiasm, the fans are the same. \n“Sunday is a special match for us, a special match for United fans, so my invitation is: Don’t come to the theatre, come to play with us.” \nIt was a night of frustration for Wayne Rooney, who missed a glorious chance to become United’s all-time leading scorer before being substituted. \nIt took until the 56th minute for United to break the deadlock when Mata touched home Henrikh Mkhitaryan's header before substitute Fellaini nodded home a second. Marouane Fellaini of Manchester United scores the second goal to make the score 2-0 during the EFL Cup Semi-Final first leg match between Manchester United and Hull City at Old Trafford on January 10, 2017 in Manchester, England.

I was not expecting to win four or five. 1-0 for me will always be a good result. But 2-0 is obviously better. And with a semi-final we are not at Wembley yet but the second goal is maybe the important goal.\" \nMourinho was frustrated with they way his side celebrated Mata's opening goal with the game still in the balance and added: \"In cup ties every goal can be crucial and why celebrate when you have half an hour to play? I don't think so. I think there is no reason for a celebration with the first goal.\" \nThe Portuguese is not concerned about the availability of Zlatan Ibrahimovic for the weekend clash with Liverpool after he was left out of the game against the Tigers with illness and when asked if he would still be struggling said: \"I don't think so.\" Mourinho criticised the way his team celebrated their opener but hugged Fellaini after his goal (Photo: REUTERS) \nFollowing the game, Mourinho spoke to the press and claimed both the players and the fans will need to do better on Sunday. \nThe Portuguese also claimed that Fellaini has his full backing and always has done. \nFinally, Mourinho admitted that a deal for Morgan Schneiderlin has been agreed - but he is sad the player is leaving. poll loading Who will win Sunday's clash at Old Trafford? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:12:34.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
