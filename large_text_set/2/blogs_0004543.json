Yeah, we’re as upset as you are.\nTBH, this isn’t surprising considering that the Republican Party leaders are continually conservative, religious men who see birth control as something that encourages sex (as if that’s a bad thing!) rather than does everything from helping people with terribly painful periods to allowing reproductive freedom .\nA quick refresher: under The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, birth control costs were overwhelmingly cheaper, though not all insurance companies covered birth control completely. While it wasn’t perfect, it was definitely cheaper across the board, and more people were able to access the birth control they needed for a variety of reasons. Good, right? We thought so too, but in ending Obamacare, the Republican Party is ending this measure, too.\nAccording to our friends at Refinery29 , House Budget Chair Diane Black was asked about birth control coverage under employer-sponsored health plans, and what people who rely on these sorts of plans can expect to see under the Trump administration. Black said,\n“That is not part of our program.” Meaning that, no, birth control is not likely going to be covered under whatever healthcare plan the Republicans come up with. As if we didn’t already feel like women’s healthcare isn’t a priority! Ugh, this is so frustrating.\nBasically, we should prepare for birth control pills to be anywhere from $20-$100 , and IUDs to be close to $1000 . It’s not looking so good. \nEspecially not for people who already struggle to afford the reproductive healthcare they need. Rewire notes that an estimated 48.5 million women will be directly impacted by this change, despite only three out of ten voters wanting this to happen. Yeah, we’re not pleased. So keep on contacting your senators, and making your voice heard!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:21:30.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
