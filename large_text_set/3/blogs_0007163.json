At a press conference on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, the representatives disclosed how they plan to respond. \n“You have to get rid of Obamacare completely,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) said. The legislation released on Monday does not satisfy that condition. \n“The leadership plan is Obamacare in a different form,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) said, agreeing with his colleague. \nInstead of going along with the Republican leadership’s plan, Jordan noted that he will reintroduce the bill every Republican voted for last year: the bill that completely repeals Obamacare. Then, he will introduce separate legislation to replace with a “market centered” model that will bring down premiums. \nThe House bill was a “missed opportunity” and “a step in the wrong direction,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said. \nThe White House, however, has praised and defended the GOP's new legislation - although HHS Secretary Tom Price did note it is a work in progress. After meeting with Republicans at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he is \"proud\" to support their replacement plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:33:20.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
