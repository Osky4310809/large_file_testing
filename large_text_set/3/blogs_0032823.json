Playing is simple: just pull up the app on your phone or desktop, search for somewhere you think would be a good place to play, and get ready to munch on some dots. \n\nJust open up your Maps app and Ms. Pac Man is just waiting for you.\nImage: screenshot/google maps\nOnce you press on the Ms. Pac-Man icon, your Map screen is transformed into an arcade-y grid, ghosts Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Sue pop up, and you're off to the races. \n\nMs. Pac-Man is ready to much on those pac-dots.\nImage: screenshot/google\nThere's not as many features as last year , when a list of clues sent users on a globe-trotting challenge to play, but it's just as fun to play through Ms. Pac-Man's five lives wherever you are IRL. \nThe \"prank\" is a welcome move by Google on April Fools' Day, which is becoming more of an overblown brand marketing opportunity for the whole last week of March than a one-off day of jokes and mischief. We actually get something we can enjoy for the day instead of an over-hyped campaign designed to make us look dumb — that's just not funny. \nWATCH: World's first robot-operated 3D printing factory is the future of manufacturing", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:19:50.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
