The performance was derailed as Carey gave up on singing (and lip syncing ), waltzing around the stage, while her back-up dancers continued on. “It just don’t get any better,” she said before leaving the stage.\nShe left the stage but walked into history and into Colbert’s waiting opening monologue. On Tuesday night, Colbert got in touch with his inner diva, claiming he was also facing technical difficulties. “I’m sorry, there’s nothing in my prompter here. Jim, can we fix that?” Colbert said, as backup dancers surrounded him. “I’m sorry, I was not informed. Am I supposed to be singing right now?”\nColbert was carried away by his dancers as he explained, “We’ve got a great show!” Watch below.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T19:03:33.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
