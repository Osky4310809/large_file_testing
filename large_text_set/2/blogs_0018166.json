Several other children were also present in the home at the time of the shooting, according to Pomona Lt. Eddie Vazquez.\n\"This is right up there with some of the more senseless acts of violence that we see as police officers,\" he said during a morning news conference.\nMultiple holes from the bullets were still visible outside the house early Tuesday morning, video from the scene showed.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the home was targeted, or if the shooting was random.\nSeveral neighbors told KTLA another home in the area had been fired upon last month, and Vazquez confirmed the incident took place at the same home where the boy was killed.\nThe first shooting was still under investigation.\nThe family has no known gang ties, Pomona Sgt. Bert Sanchez said Monday night.\nVazquez described the neighborhood as \"generally ... pretty safe.\"\n\"A lot of good people live here, we're really close to schools,\" he said. \"This neighborhood has been relatively a good place to live.\"\nThe family who lived in the home were long-term residents and were very involved with education and the community, according to the lieutenant.\nOne neighbor added that the family who lives at the home mostly keep to themselves.\n\"They don't bother nobody,\" he said.\nNo arrests have been made, and Vazquez pleaded any witnesses to step forward with information.\n\"If there is anyone out there that knows anything, any suspect information, any details whatsoever – however small they might seem – we would appreciate that,\" he said.\nPolice have asked the public to provide information about the shooting by calling them at 909-620-2085.\nAnonymous tips can also be left through Crime Stoppers by dialing 1-800-222-8477.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:44:47.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
