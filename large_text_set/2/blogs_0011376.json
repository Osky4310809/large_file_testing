Katy Perry wore a jumpsuit to a Grammys afterparty that is so head-scratchingly strange/awesome, we don’t know how to classify it.\nThe 32-year-old pop diva showed off her leg with a classic high-slit — classic except for the pantsuit part. That’s right. The slit is in the pants. One pant, to be exact.\nWith a plunging neckline and faux double breasted blazer buttons, Katy Perry’s look was like menswear meeting the sexiest of women’s wear. The 13-time Grammy nominee who had earlier performed at the awards show , slipped into the number for Universal Music Group’s afterparty at LA’s Ace Hotel.\nPaul Archuleta/FilmMagic The choice certainly showcases her ample curves. No one could say she didn’t look hot-as-all-get-out. Greg Doherty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images The newly blonde pop star accentuated her mile-long legs with strappy pointed pumps. Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage During the awards show, Perry debuted her single “Chained to the Rhythm” with Skip Marley. The performance ended with an epic shot of the U.S. Constitution projected onto the Staples Center.\nShe wore a pantsuit for that performance, too, but that one was white with a black lapel.\nShe proudly displayed a “persist” armband (in honor of Senator Elizabeth Warren) and a Planned Parenthood pin. Kevin Winter/Getty “Chained to the Rhythm” — written by Katy, Max Martin, and Sia — will appear on her fourth album, the follow-up to the 2013 record Prism .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:56:13.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
