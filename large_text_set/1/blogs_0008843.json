Official summary Edit Journey off the coast of Morrowind, to the island of Solstheim. Encounter new towns, dungeons, and quests, as you traverse the ash wastes and glacial valleys of this new land. Become more powerful with shouts that bend the will of your enemies and even tame dragons. Your fate, and the fate of Solstheim, hangs in the balance as you face off against your deadliest adversary â€“ the first Dragonborn. Solstheim Edit \nDragonborn takes place on the island of Solstheim , located north east of Skyrim . The geography of the island bears similar traits to both Vvardenfell and Skyrim and ranges from ash wastes to glacial valleys. [1] \nThe north is dominated by the arctic climate similar to that found in Winterhold Hold , while the south features the jagged landscape reminiscent of the Dunmer homeland . Dunmer migration Edit Raven Rock as it appears in the Fourth Era. \nFollowing the eruption of Red Mountain in 4E 5 , thousands of Dunmer were forced to flee Morrowind . Many crossed over the border into Skyrim seeking refuge, and whilst they were accommodated, the Nords graciously offered them the island of Solstheim as their new home. [2] Locations Edit \nThe mining town of Raven Rock , located on the southern coast, is a far cry from its former days. After the mass Dunmer migration it has taken on a heavy Dunmer influence in its architecture and culture. House Redoran is an established presence as seen by their banners adorning the walls outside the settlement. \nTo the north the Skaal Village , Thirsk Mead Hall and the ruins of Castle Karstaag can be found in the icy tundras. The First Dragonborn Main article: Miraak \nThe primary antagonist in Dragonborn is Miraak , the mysterious former Dragon Priest who is revealed to be the first individual gifted with the dragon blood . \nHe ruled over Solstheim thousands of years ago at the behest of Dragons, much like his counterparts in Skyrim, however at some point this changed and he rebelled against the winged overlords. Apocrypha Edit A mysterious tome within Apocrypha \nIn addition to the island of Solstheim, Dragonborn also involves venturing into the plane of Oblivion known as Apocrypha , domain of the Daedric Prince of forbidden knowledge, Hermaeus Mora . The realm appears as a large citadel-type building with twisted columns and is home to dangerous creatures, such as Seekers and Lurkers . \nDuring the course of the add-on, new abilities and powers can be learnt in the realm from mysterious Black Books . Preview trailer \nA preview trailer was released by Bethesda on 5th November 2012 that showed various aspects of the add-on. Narration He was once one of them, the Dragon Priest. He ruled here in their name, ruled over Solstheim. But he did not serve the Dragons, he devoured them. And like them, he seeks to return.
