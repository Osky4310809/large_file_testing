It got a lot of attention, mainly due to its integrated Halo keyboard that could be turned into a writing pad, but many reviewers didn’t care for the virtual keyboard design. Now it appears Lenovo is preparing to launch a larger version of the Yoga Book, but with a couple of hardware compromises in order to lower its price.\nDon’t miss: Lenovo Yoga Book review \nAccording to a listing on Amazon, the Lenovo Yoga Book A12 will offer users a larger 12.2-inch display with a display resolution of 1280 x 800, which is less than the current 10.1-inch model that includes a 1080p screen. The new Yoga Book A12 will also have less RAM at 2GB, versus 4GB for the current version. That may explain why the price for the Yoga Book A12 is listed on Amazon as just $299.99, compared to the $499.99 10.1-inch model.\nThe other specs on the 2.2-pound Yoga Book A12 include an Intel Atom x5-Z8550 processor running at 2.2GHz, 32GB of onboard storage, a microSD card for adding up to 128GB of additional storage, and a 10,500mAh battery that is supposed to offer up to 15 hours of battery life. Inside, the tablet hybrid will have Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow , which may be an issue for people who would be looking forward to trying out the latest version of Android .\nThe Amazon listing shows that the Lenovo Yoga Book A12 is “Temporarily out of stock”, so it’s not even available to purchase yet. It’s more than possible that the company will officially announce this newer, larger Yoga Book sometime next month as part of the 2017 Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, Spain. Hopefully Lenovo will also reveal a Windows 10 version of this tablet at the same time.\nSee it on Amazon ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:08:02.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
