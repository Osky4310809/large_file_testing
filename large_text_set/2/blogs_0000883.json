The Apenheul Primate Park has officially titled the 4-year experiment “Tinder For Orangutans,” which aims to study how female orangutans select their partners. Researchers will show Samboja, an 11-year-old female orangutan, pictures of possible matches from all over the world, some being as far away as Singapore. The zoo hopes this will enhance the chances of the two primates hitting it off. \nResearchers have conducted similar tests in the past: They found that bonobos, another close relative to humans, had positive reactions to images of their species mating or grooming each other.
