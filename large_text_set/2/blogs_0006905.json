Time of death: February 9. \nWhile some of us may have gotten a little excited to see Taylor Kinney watching Lady Gaga perform (and Spider-Man her way into the stadium) at the Super Bowl , it looks like that bad romance is over for good. \nJust kidding! The two seemed pretty great for each other — even m’Lady said they still “love each other” when speaking to Howard Stern after their breakup.

The man who's been spotted with Lady Gaga in the last days is Christian Carino. pic.twitter.com/UQV1sna6zu \n— Andrés | Lady Gaga (@slayjoannex) February 9, 2017 \nThe name of this agent?
