I was in an abusive relationship for six years. When first met my husband to be it was all normal. But then, you don’t meet someone and expect them to be abusive straight away.\nIt started with little things that, at the time, I thought were romantic. He would send me plane tickets so I could travel with him, and want me to go everywhere with him. But the gestures became increasingly controlling. While they seemed like heady romantic gestures originally, what they actually were was a build up towards isolation.\nIt kept building up, slowly.\nIn arguments, it would always be my fault, and afterwards, he would talk about how we could stop me from creating more problems, telling me things like ‘we need to to make sure you don’t get stressed’.\nHe had this manipulative way of replaying what had happened during a row to make it my fault. It was so insidious when it’s happening to you, you can’t see it.\n\nThe thing I would say, more than anything else, is that the experience was a slow eroding of me, eating away around the edges, until I was in an isolated position and very vulnerable.\nIt’s that slow build up that allows domestic abuse to happen. When domestic abuse is reported, very often you report the violence but that’s not what you’re met with inside the relationships, that’s not how it starts – It’s much more subtle than that.\nFrom the emotional abuse, the financial abuse started. He took control of the money, telling me he’d sort it out, that he wanted to take care of everything. At the beginning of the relationships I had a house and a good job. By the end, I had neither. He pressured me to sell my business which left me without any financial independence which of course made leaving much harder. I know that that it’s a very common way to control someone.\n\nGiving up work also caused more isolation in my life. As well as being cut off from my friends and family, I didn’t have my job. It’s all part of nibbling way at everything that makes you a successful and independent person. It took my purpose, I couldn’t see my talents anymore\nThe physical abuse started when I was pregnant with our first child. It’s a lot harder to ignore physical abuse, but because your confidence has been destroyed and because you’re so economically dependent, your ability to do anything about it is so reduced.\nI’m told it’s quite common for physical abuse to start during pregnancy. When you’re pregnant, you’re so vulnerable. The thought of trying to leave someone when you’re having their child was too much. I thought I had to ride it out.\nThe physical abuse was a wake-up call of sorts, and of course, I knew it wasn’t right, but it’s so easy to say ‘you should leave’. When you don’t even know which way is up, it’s not possible. That’s why I needed Refuge.\n\nLeaving on your own is incredibly difficult. You need an organisation like Refuge to support you to leave, to get you through that very dangerous part when you’re planning to leave.\nThat’s [planning to leave] when the violence ratchets up – it became terrifying.\nI would not be alive now without Refuge. Without their guidance and support, I’m very certain I wouldn’t have survived. I cannot stress enough how vital Refuge stepping in at that time was. I couldn’t have done it on my own, despite having lots going for me.\nRefuge understand that it’s difficult to explain what has taken place, they know that abuse doesn’t always follow a pattern and can be erratic. Knowing that I didn’t have to make a cohesive story about it really helped me to talk about it.\nThey did practical things, too- straight forward things that I needed.\nThey put new locks on my doors and windows. I had a panic alarm from the police after an attack where my ex-husband was arrested, but when my legal case collapsed, and he wasn’t prosecuted , the panic alarm was taken away.\nI was terrified, but Refuge was there. They made sure the house was secure. They made a lock-in room in the house with a landline, in case my ex managed to break in.\nRefuge went to the police station with me, we took photos in, the Refuge worker made sure they had a proper file on my husband, that they knew what he looked like and what his number plate was.\nPicture: Getty I couldn’t have done that on my own. I was barely functioning. I couldn’t have known that was what I needed to do. Without their help and their knowledge I would have been a prisoner in my own home – terrified at night. I wouldn’t have been able to live. Because they know what to do, what specialist services to contact within the police, how the police work, they are a link between you and the people who are supposed to protect you but aren’t always able to because they are overstretched.\nThe Benefit pop-up raises money for Refuge, which is essential. But it also raises awareness, and helps to make it more socially acceptable to talk about abuse.\nThere is still a lot that needs to change in the way that we talk about abuse. People need to understand that it doesn’t matter if you’re educated or confident– abuse happens across all education levels and social classes.\nWe also need to move away from a victim blaming culture. I didn’t do anything wrong – it’s taken me a long time to be able to say that. I fell prey to a deliberately manipulative individual. It could happen to any of us, and we need to understand that.\n\nBuilding awareness will also prevent situations like this one from happening in the future, and will enable women to get out earlier when they can. There are small types of behaviour that are red flags, and if we can see them coming, we can prevent coercive behaviours and types of behaviour. It’s not just about physical abuse, it’s also about emotional and financial abuse. Things like the Benefit pop-up help to get that message out there.\nWhat can you do?
