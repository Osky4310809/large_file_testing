It was on this day when the British carved out the state from Bengal Presidency in 1912. The state government has been celebrating Bihar Diwas every year since 2010. \nThe programme to be inaugurated by chief minister Nitish Kumar at Gandhi Maidan, would focus on liquor ban and its impact on the socio-cultural life in the state. \nBihar had on January 21 formed a human chain across the state for spreading awareness about de-addiction and prohibition. The ruling JD(U) claimed that it was the world’s longest human chain, spanning a distance of 11,000 km with over 2 crore people joining hands across the state. \nA series of programmes have been lined up for the celebration. Besides the programmes at Gandhi Maidan, classical music would be presented at SK Memorial Hall and literary sessions would be held at Premchand Rangshala. The entire show is being coordinated by Bihar Education Project (BEP). \n“Many illustrious musicians of the country have been approached for the programme. Noted Banaras gharana vocalists, Pt Rajan-Sajan Mishra, and Beghum Parveen Sultana have already given their consent to perform,” said a BEP official. “We will have street plays, painting exhibitions, songs, seminars and discussions on the topic alcohol free Bihar,” he said. \nVarious government departments will also put up stalls at Gandhi Maidan to showcase their achievements. There would also be stalls of special cuisines. \nThere would also be performance by well known Bollywood singers Sunidhi Chauhan and Akriti Kakkad. “We are also in touch with some television channel reality show singers. Their consent is expected in a day or two,” an official said. \nEight big screens would be set up at various corners of Gandhi Maidan for people to enjoy the performance of the singers. \nThe district administration would install close circuit television cameras in every corner of the ground to keep tabs on bad elements. \nBesides, the industry department and Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusandhan Sansthan have also planned to mark the occasion with 15-day Bihar Utsav, handloom and handicraft exhibition-cum-sale in Delhi. The event, which is scheduled to begin from March 16, will feature 50 stalls of arts and crafts of the region. Cultural programmes would also be organised in the evening. tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T05:30:00.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
