There have been delays where people haven't been seen for months at a time.\" Image caption Whistleblowers have said work pressures mean offenders are not being seen for months at a time \nWorking Links is introducing a new practice which involves offenders being more frequently supervised over the phone. \nAnother anonymous probation officer said: \"I actually have no idea of who I'm talking to. All you hear is a voice you have no idea where somebody is or what they're doing.\" \nHelen Coley worked for the service for 27 years but quit last year because she was unhappy with the changes being brought in. \nShe said: \"The probation service, what's left of it, is just waiting for somebody to murdered, raped or very seriously wounded. It could happen any day and could happen anywhere.\" Image caption Former probation officer Helen Coley said the service is \"just waiting for somebody to murdered, raped or very seriously wounded\" Image caption Probation union Napo's general secretary Ian Lawrence said \"there'll be more chaos\" if the service is not \"seriously reviewed\" \nThe probation union Napo's general secretary Ian Lawrence called for the operational model to be \"seriously reviewed\". \nHe said if changes are not made soon \"there'll be more chaos, there'll be more confusion and there'll be more reoffending\". \nWorking Links said: \"We are committed to reducing reoffending and protecting the communities in which we work.\" \nThe Ministry of Justice said: \"We hold providers rigorously to account for their performance. We are carrying out a comprehensive review of the probation system to make sure it is preventing future victims.\" \nThe findings are due to be published in April. \nWatch Inside Out South West's investigation on BBC One on Monday 20 March at 19:30 BST and on the iPlayer for 30 days thereafter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:26:00.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
