AGAIN.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers hit 25 three-pointers against the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, the second time they’ve done just that in the past 12 months. With the 25 threes, the Cavaliers have set a new regular season record for made triples while tying their own all-time record.\nKyle Korver hit the 25th shot, which doubled as a dagger in a 131-126 Cleveland win. The Cavaliers had 14 makes at halftime, and they finished with seven players contributing to their 25 total makes.\n2️⃣5️⃣ THREES!\n\nWe just set the @NBA All-Time record for threes in a regular season game with 25! pic.twitter.com/dmGE4aRHRt \n— Cleveland Cavaliers (@cavs) March 4, 2017 LeBron James and Kyrie Irving led the way, hitting a combined 11 threes. James had 38 points total, while Irving contributed 43, which is the third time James and Irving have combined for 80 points or more.\nIn Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals last year, the Cavaliers also hit 25 three-pointers. That still stands as the postseason record, and Cleveland has now tied it as their overall record. This Friday’s performance came without Kevin Love and J.R. Smith , who were 10 of those threes last year. Here are those 25 from last season’s playoffs.\nIn Friday’s showing, LeBron James added this ridiculous three, dribbling into the corner and nailing a contested one-footer fading away. Seriously, who hits this?\nLBJ out here looking like MJ on @ESPNNBA pic.twitter.com/QuBMCNU7B8 \n— NBA (@NBA) March 4, 2017 The seven players who contributed are as follows: James (6), Irving (5), Channing Frye (3), Richard Jefferson (3), Derrick Williams (3), Kyle Korver (3), and Iman Shumpert (2).\nOnly five teams had ever even hit at least 23 threes in a game: the Magic (23) in 2009, the Rockets (23) in 2013, both the Rockets (24) and Nuggets (24) this season, and the aforementioned Cavaliers game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T04:52:54.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
