(Credit to Serebii) from pokemongo \nUnfortunately, it seems that in recent weeks the drop rate of 10 kilometer eggs has dropped quite significantly. Throughout September especially, users have started complaining more and more that they virtually never come across these eggs, only getting 2km and 5km eggs from Poke Stops. It doesn’t seem that there’s much that can be done about this. What level you are apparently has nothing to do with it, so it’s not as if you come across fewer 10km eggs as you progress. Rather, users have speculated that this might have to do with the number of eggs you hatch, so you have go through a lot of 2km and 5km eggs before you get your next 10km. \nFor those new to the game and new to the process of hatching eggs, you first need to put an egg in an incubator before all your walking will actually start to be registered. Here’s how you do that: Hit the Poke Ball on the bottom center of the screen. Select “Pokemon.” Pick the egg you want to hatch. Hit “start incubation.” A menu will come up showing the number of incubators you have. You start the game with one infinite incubator that never breaks, and you can also get additional incubators from Poke Stops which break after a few uses. The egg will now be displayed as being inside the incubator. When you have walked either 2, 5 or 10 kilometers, the egg will hatch and give you a Pokemon. \nIt’s also important to remember that there’s a limit for how fast you can be going and still have your distance count towards egg hatching , so you won’t be able to make progress on eggs while in a vehicle. The way the game figures out distance is also a bit wonky; it does so not by using the phone’s speedometer but by registering your location every so often and seeing how far you traveled since it last checked. For that reason, the distance measurement is not always accurate unless you are always walking in a straight line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:34:37.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
