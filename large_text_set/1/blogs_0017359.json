What the future holds \nIt all comes back to the smartphone. \nBack in October, after \"Super Mario Run\" was announced but before the debut of the Nintendo Switch, Nomura upgraded its rating on Nintendo's stock to a \"Buy.\" The firm said that the company's willingness to dabble in smartphones \" heralds a change in earnings structure at Nintendo.\" By Nomura's reckoning, the profitable smartphone games will \"provide support\" to the console business, meaning that Nintendo can have its console cake and eat it too. \nThis plays straight into Nintendo's stated strategy for getting into smartphones games in the first place. As Nintendo tells it, games like \"Pokémon Go\" and \"Super Mario Run\" have the very pleasant side-effect of building interest in the company's console games . That theory seems to have been borne out, as \"Pokémon Sun and Moon,\" the first games in the franchise released since the \"Pokémon Go\" craze hit, set sales records . \nNintendo \nBut some, like Jefferies Equity Analyst Atul Goyal, go a step further: \"Nintendo's long-term outlook is driven by the [intellectual property],\" Goyal tells Business Insider. In other words, he says, the future of Nintendo rests on its ability to monetize its most popular franchises, starting from \"Super Mario Run\" and \"Pokémon Go,\" and going well beyond. \nThe way Goyal sees it, it's simple math. As an example, the Pokémon series on Nintendo consoles has sold an estimated 280 million games over the last 20 years ; \"Pokémon Go\" had been downloaded 500 million times as of September 2016 . \nIt's a much bigger audience, and Nintendo has a huge leg up, because so many millions of people already love the company and its cast of instantly-recognizable characters. By the same token, and for the same reasons, Nintendo recently licensed its characters to Universal Studios for theme park attractions . Game on \nSo yes, if the Switch is a massive flop, you might see Nintendo make a huge and dramatic shift towards smartphone games. But even if the Switch is a huge success, there's a healthy chance that smartphone games will still prove to be more lucrative, and so Nintendo will focus more of its efforts there regardless. \nAnd while Nintendo's first \"Super Mario\" smartphone game didn't generate the kinds of profits that Wall Street was looking for, the company has committed to trying and trying again, with the free-to-play \" Fire Emblem Heroes \" dropping for Android on February 2nd and iPhone later. \n\"Super Mario Odyssey\" Nintendo \nThe good news for die-hard Nintendo console gamers is that the likely long-term success of Nintendo's smartphone efforts will actually reduce investor pressure on the company to move away from its hardware business. The potential downside is that if Nintendo's iPhone and Android games business really picks up, the company's hardware business will naturally become a smaller area of focus, which could result in a diminished number of console games. \n\nEither way, the Nintendo Switch is shaping up to be at least a moderate success. But taking the long view, this console may turn out to be a small piece of a much different strategy for Nintendo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T15:41:24.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
