After the Packers jumped out to a 21-3 lead, the Cowboys fought back, before the Packers went on one last drive to put themselves in position for the game-winning field goal.\nOn that drive, Aaron Rodgers hit Jared Cook with a perfectly placed pass that Cook turned into an even more spectacular catch. \nAfter the game, Randall Cobb said that play wasn’t designed at all:\nCobb said the final play was not an actual playcall. Rodgers just told each receiver what to do, like a kid drawing in the dirt. Seriously.\n— Robert Klemko (@RobertKlemko) January 16, 2017 Rodgers and the Packers were 4-6 after their first 10 games, but they’ve been able to piece things together and make a run that’s taken them to the NFC Championship game, and perhaps even further.\nIt’s things like drawing up plays randomly at the most crucial times that always make for the best stories, right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T05:16:39.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
