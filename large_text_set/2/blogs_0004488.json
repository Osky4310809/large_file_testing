And, yes, Mac received a gently used Dominoes Pizza Rolex watch. He had no clue it was coming and we’ll release the epic video later. \nBut maybe you guys were right, Mac is a kinder, gentler person now. I thought he didn’t deserve his pizza watch but maybe I was wrong? Time will tell. Advertisement Advertisement 6 \nYou wanna’ know how awesome Jake Owen is? The meetup last night started at 7pm and Jake had a concert to play at 8:30 at a venue nowhere near our meetup. Jake called me at 6:30, “I’m going to theCHIVE meetup, I don’t care. Chivers have priority tonight. If I’m a little late, so be it.” \nThat’s a true Chiver. Thanks, Jake. \nWe are getting crazy at the Waste Management Open today, you’re going to want to follow my Instagram for what’s about to happen. 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:43:47.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
