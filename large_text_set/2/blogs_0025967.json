While the former boasts features like a 4K HDR display and Snapdragon 835 SoC, the latter is still a pretty powerful flagship, and shares quite a few features with the XZ Premium as well. We had a chance to go hands on with the device at MWC 2017, and here’s a sneak peek.The Xperia XZs features the standard Sony design elements, in a more refined form factor. It’s constructed out of solid metal, and features a matte finish at the back that makes for good grippage but tends to pick up smudges and even scratches fairly easily. The Xperia XZs features a compact 5.2-inch full HD display, which is crisp with good brightness levels and viewing angles. A highlight of the device is its IP65/IP68-certification for water and dust resistance. The key feature of the phone however is its 19MP primary camera with the ability to shoot super slow motion video at 960fps. We got a chance to try out this feature at Sony’s booth. It’s worth noting that the phone can only capture six seconds of slow motion video at 960fps. It works within a normal video, where you can tap to enable to record in slo-mo at the exact moment you want to capture. The results were very impressive for a smartphone camera, but we’re not sure it will be a widely adopted feature among. The phone also features Sony’s predictive hybrid autofocus tech which senses motion when the camera is on, and takes shots even before you press the shutter button so you don’t miss a shot of your subject in motion. The front camera on the XZs is a 13MP unit with a 22mm wide angle lens, ISO 6400 and f/2.0 aperture. Sony Xperia XZs 1 of 9 \nPowering the phone is a Snapdragon 820 processor, which is an outdated choice considering the Snapdragon 821 upgrade. Working in tandem is 4GB of RAM and 32GB/64GB of storage. The phone features a 2,900mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0. The Sony Xperia XZs will go on sale globally starting April, but we don’t have an India-specific launch date yet. We’ll keep you posted with those details once they’re out, but expect the phone to cost a bomb once it does launch in the country.
