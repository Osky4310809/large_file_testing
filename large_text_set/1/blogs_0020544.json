That’s why it has incorporated the Pro Bowl Skills Showdown into this year’s event. \nDodgeball is by far the coolest event at the Pro Bowl Skills Showdown, so this was intriguing. As competitive as NFL players are, it should be a joy to watch them go up against each other, seeing which opponents can dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge most effectively.\nOn Tuesday, NFL public relations representative Brian McCarthy announced via Twitter that the league will add an additional event to the Skills Showdown .\nThe addition was the WR Drone Drop. Where a drone flies high into the air, and drops a football for a receiver to catch.\nThe cool #ProBowlSkills event I alluded to is a WR Drone Drop. Video here via @nfl from our test https://t.co/KHfHqAJGGz \n— Brian McCarthy (@NFLprguy) January 25, 2017 In addition to dodgeball and the WR Drone Drop, Pro Bowlers will get to participate in a Power Relay Challenge, Precision Passing, and Best Hands competitions. \nThe relay is obviously a race, which should be fun, considering the blazing speed of players like Antonio Brown and Tyreek Hill . \nThe Precision Passing contest will feature some of the top quarterback talent and receivers in the league, and the Best Hands competition should be a hard-fought one, with lots of candidates for the top spot. Dez Bryant dropped just one pass out of 92 targets last season, so he may be a contender to win that one. \nThe Pro Bowl Skills Showdown will air on Thursday, January 26 at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN.
