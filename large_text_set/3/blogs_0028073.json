That will happen! It’s not all about the money as everyone is speculating here lately. You’d think these analysts spoke to me directly. When you don’t know what’s going on people will say anything to create or make a story!” \nPeterson said he’s eager to go to a Super Bowl contender. \n“Finding the best fit and helping a team in a major way win a championship is my main objective! I’m in no rush,” Peterson wrote. \nWhen that will happen remains to be seen, but Peterson’s comments suggest that he’d be fine with waiting until training camps open before he finds the right team. He’s committed to playing, but he’s not committed to finding his team right away.
