They're looser, more comfortable, and contain the scent of your beloved. Win-win-win. But apparently, men don't appreciate the thievery. And in retaliation, one man in particular, 22-year-old Marquis McNeil, stole something of hers in return. Last year, he started with her hoodies, jackets and sweatshirts. But this year, he upped the anti by stealing his girlfriend's wrap. He told BuzzFeed , \"I didn't have my du-rag at the time and it's the next best thing if not better.\" Fellas I'm doing this for every hoodie ive ever lost to a female, we gotta start taking they shit in 2017. pic.twitter.com/KisZOj2HCx \n— Marquis.

In his interview with Buzzfeed, McNeil had an answer for that too. “As far as the tutorial goes I don’t think I will do one. There are already so many on YouTube and it’s only easy for us guys to make the different style wraps because we don’t have a lot of hair to get in the way,”   @Mute_McNeil pic.twitter.com/dP65rfRRbR \n— TheRealFlexGod (@DaFlexGod_) March 19, 2017 @Mute_McNeil actual factual pic.twitter.com/iE8pdqFPiq \n— Ant B.
