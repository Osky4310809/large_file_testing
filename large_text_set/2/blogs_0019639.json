However, Shaw also managed to grab the limelight DURING the match too… by eating a pie on camera.

On the one hand, lots of fans were quick to declare Shaw a legend and a hero: However, there were plenty of other (largely sarcastic) fans who thought Shaw had basically ruined the FA Cup So, where do you stand?
