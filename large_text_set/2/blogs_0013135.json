Working with the non-profit Veterans Community Project (VCP), a Kansas City neighborhood is in the process of creating the Veterans Village, a neighborhood of 50 tiny homes built by fellow veterans in order to house their homeless brothers and sisters. \nAs reported by Fox 4 KC , land for the new neighborhood has already been cleared. Working in collaboration with the Veterans Community Project, several local organizations are helping put the tiny home community together. The building team is made up of fellow veterans who are currently constructing 50, 20-foot-long and 240-square-foot tiny homes that will make up the new community. The process is currently on going, but they are shooting for a move in date in late 2017. \nRelated: Tiny House Nation’s Zack Giffin will teach veterans to build their own homes \nVCP founder and Marine Corps veteran Kevin Jamison explained the inspiration for the initiative to Fox4, “These are my brothers and sisters out there on the streets. We didn’t want to see any veteran suffering. We want to give them something they can stay in, call it their own and then socialize and re-integrate at their own pace.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T16:52:36.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
