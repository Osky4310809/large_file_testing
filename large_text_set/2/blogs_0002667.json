File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - Students should be taught how to use condoms and be provided with the necessary skills and information on how to protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases and teenage pregnancy, National Youth Commission (NYC) chair Aiza Seguerra said. \nReacting to the decision not to distribute condoms in schools, Seguerra said the Department of Education (DepEd) should ensure that teachers diligently follow the sex education curriculum approved by the government. \n“We respectfully appeal that our teachers be more diligent in teaching sex education and teach the students how to protect themselves,” Seguerra told The STAR in Filipino. \n“We’ve had reports that even if it is part of the curriculum, these are still not taught and are being avoided because there are teachers who think it is taboo. We cannot protect our young people if we do not give them the right information,” added the NYC chief. \nBut a Catholic bishop thanked the DepEd for rejecting the plan of the Department of Health (DOH) to distribute condoms in schools. \nCalling officials not to turn on a blind eye on the rising number of early sexual encounters among the youth, Seguerra called on DepEd to ensure that students be taught about safe sex – “specifically condom skills” – and refer them to facilities and organizations where they can have access to the prophylactic.   \nThe NYC chair also stressed the role of parents in protecting children from the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. \n“Please protect and arm your children with the right information so they can decide correctly (for themselves),” Seguerra said. \nLast week, Education Secretary Leonor Briones ruled out the proposal of the DOH to distribute condoms to students, saying the department would not be part of such moves as its role is primarily to enhance gender sensitivity and reproductive health education through the strengthening and review of the basic education curriculum. \n“Nothing within the school premises because right now you have the health centers who are already tasked with that function,” Briones said. \nBriones said DepEd would work toward improving reproductive health education in public schools, such as the inclusion of discussions on the consequences and dangers of pre-marital sex. \nIn an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel on Tuesday, the DepEd chief noted that condoms are not the only way to prevent teenage pregnancy and the spread of HIV. \n“We encourage students who are sexually active to abstain. If not, we encourage them to talk to their guidance counselors,” Briones said, noting that the children under their care are minors. \n“We are also encouraging peer exchange of experience as students may be hesitant to talk to their parents or teachers,” she added. Welcome move \nSan Jose Nueva Ecija Bishop Roberto Mallari said he was pleased that the DepEd turned down the moves of the DOH to hand out condoms inside school campuses. \n“Thank God. What would happen to the children if they would be given condoms in schools. The DepEd is more in a position to know what is good for our children,” Mallari said.
