John Unson, file \nBASILAN, Philippines -— The main and last bastion of the Abu Sayyaf group in the village of Macalang has fallen and villagers celebrated during People’s Day on Monday without fear of reprisal. \nMacalang was the main Abu Sayyaf stronghold for decades until the local government and the military flushed the group out early this month. \nMacalang, a secluded village of Al-Barka, is rarely reached by government services due to its rugged terrain, lack of roads and the strong influence of the Abu Sayyaf. \nTwo other strongholds -— one in Baguindan, Tipo-Tipo town and Baiwas in Sumisip -— fell last year. People’s Days -— where the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao brings government services to far-flung areas -— were also held there. \nBullet holes and pock marks on coconut trees, mosques and houses are a testament to recent offensives by the military. \n“This is the last bastion and main camp of the Abu Sayyaf and Macalang is their center of gravity,” ARMM Gov. Mujiv Hataman, who led local officials and military officials visiting the place for the first time, said.   \nHataman said the fall of Macalang was important as the residents have settled back into normalcy. \nThe military will be deploying a company of soldiers -— around 250 soldiers -— to secure the place and prevent the militants from propagating extremism anew. \n“The area is traditional considered by most of the troops as their waterloo because once they enter the terrain, either they cannot return or go out injured from the encounter against the Abu Sayyaf group,” said Maj. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., Western Mindanao Command chief. \n“The area has a very impenetrable terrain because once you are in, the people join the pintakasi because the Abu Sayyaf group indoctrinated them that soldiers are their common enemies,” Galvez added. \nPintakasi refers to members of a community setting aside rivalries and uniting against outsiders like government troops. \nGalvez said at least 256 soldiers have perished while 572 others were wounded in operations in the area since 2010. \nSarip Alista, 22, a civilian volunteer, was among the witnesses of the bloody campaign after he was badly hit by an Abu Sayyaf IED. The blast in March 2016 crippled both of his legs. \nAlista was a recipient of a pair of crutches extended by the social welfare office of the ARMM during the People’s Day here. \n“I may have suffered but it’s worth seeing people going back to their place and enjoying the fruits of our sacrifices,” Alista said in Yakan dialect. \nBasilan Gov. Hajimin Saliman-Hataman assured a strong presence of the local government even as services start to trickle in with the establishment of roads towards the area. \n“Now we celebrate as the influence of the Abu Sayyaf group is no longer here but all government services to ensure the plight of the residents is addressed,” said the Basilan governor. \nThe challenges that are facing the local government is how to rehabilitate the community, like restoring the destroyed houses, said ARMM Gov. Hataman. \nHe said Westmincom has committed the 74th Infantry Battalion under Lt. Col. John Jadloc to help to help rebuild damaged mosques. \n“On our part, buhayin namin ang government center dito,” Hataman said as he signed a memorandum of agreement with the local leaders and allotted P10 million pesos as component for the establishment of a barangay hall and livelihood program. \nThe ARMM has a budget of P807 million for 2016 to 2017. The bulk of the budget is for building roads but construction has been stalled by Abu Sayyaf attacks. \nThe Moro Islamic Liberation Front is assisting the military in securing the area for the construction of a road leading to Macalang. \nHataman said with recovery of the Macalang, the Abu Sayyaf group now is on the run and what are being done are finishing touches. \n“Sa tingin ko ang finishing touches ay hindi na ang military but by the local government and the barangays,” Hataman said. \nHe said the ulama elders were also helping in reshaping the ideological influences to the people exploited by the Abu Sayyaf group. \nDuring the People’s Day, the provincial and regional governments provided free medical checkups, relief assistance, medicines and other immediate services to 3,000 residents. \nMyrna Jo Henry, chief of the ARMM Humanitarian and Emergency Action Response Team, said at least 2,000 internally displaced people were also served in the nearby Barangay Magcawa.
