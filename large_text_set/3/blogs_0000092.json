by AAP and staff writers Source: FOX SPORTS BLUES coach Tana Umaga has named a power-packed bench featuring six current or former All Blacks, while the Force have shuffled their forward pack. \nCheck out all the latest team news! \nFORCE v REDS in Perth, Thursday 9.30pm AEDT \nQUEENSLAND Reds coach Nick Stiles hopes Taniela Tupou has learned his lesson after serving a two-week ban for a “silly” headbutt on Liam Messam. \nTupou is in line for his first Super Rugby appearance of the season after being named on the bench for Thursday night’s clash with the Western Force. \nThe 20-year-old prop had been slapped with the suspension after headbutting Chiefs captain Messam earlier this month at the Brisbane Global Rugby Tens. \nHis inclusion is the only change to the Reds’ squad who beat the Sharks last week in their season opener, with Stiles keen for his new-look side to continue building on their combinations. \n“He was pretty distraught, to be honest, when we were sitting in the judiciary hearing and he worked out he’s got a two-match suspension,” Stiles said. \n“He’s put in a lot of work through the last few years and he wanted to be in the team against the Sharks so he was really disappointed. Taniela Tupou and Stephen Moore have been named in the Reds squad. Source: News Corp Australia \n“It can be tough — he’s a 20-year-old playing tight-head and, through his deeds and social media these days, it’s brought so much attention to himself. \n“It won’t be the first and it’s not going to be the last time he’s going to be targeted by a player. \n“I just hope he’s grown up and learned from that.” \nBetter known as the ‘Tongan Thor,’ Tupou played 40 minutes for Brothers in Saturday’s Australian Club Championship clash in Brisbane against Sydney premiers Norths. \n“He was so-so, to be honest, Stiles said. \n“He got through uninjured. I would have liked to have seen him play better football but he’s an exciting prospect and he would have been in round one bar the silly headbutt. \n“We felt it was appropriate to bring him back in.” \nBoom winger Izaia Perese remains in line to make his Super Rugby debut after not being used last week. \nStiles admitted back-up halfback James Tuttle — who came off the bench to score the winning try — was putting increasing selection pressure on incumbent Nick Frisby. Rona makes mark on debut 0:40 \nMeanwhile, Force coach Dave Wessels has reshuffled his forward pack. \nYoung lock Matt Philip, No 8 Brynard Stander and former Reds prop Ben Daley all come into the starting line-up from the side that lost to the Waratahs in round one. \n“We felt that we were good in a number of areas of the game last Saturday, but we were disappointed that we didn’t win the game,” Wessels said. \n“So, what we’re looking to do this week, in hopefully better conditions, is be able to show more of what we’ve been working on from an attack perspective. \n“We’re very excited to play in front of our home crowd for the first time this season, and I think there’s a rallying call for West Australians, that if you love rugby and if you want to see Super Rugby continue in this state, whether you support the Force or not, you need to come on Thursday night. \n“More than that, we’d like you to bring a mate, it’s really important that we show through our numbers at this game that we want to keep professional rugby in Western Australia.” \nFORCE (15-1): Dane Haylett-Petty, Luke Morahan, Curtis Rona, Billy Meakes, Chance Peni, Jono Lance, Ryan Louwrens, Brynard Stander, Kane Koteka, Ross Haylett-Petty, Adam Coleman, Matt Philip, Jermaine Ainsley, Heath Tessman (c), Ben Daley \nReserves: Tatafu Polota-Nau, Pek Cowan, Tetera Faulkner, Richard Hardwick, Isi Naisarani, Michael Ruru, Ian Prior, Alex Newsome \nREDS (15-1): Karmichael Hunt, Chris Kuridrani, Samu Kerevi, Duncan Paia’aua, Eto Nabuli, Quade Cooper, Nick Frisby, Scott Higginbotham, George Smith, Adam Korczyk, Kane Douglas, Rob Simmons, Sam Talakai, Stephen Moore, James Slipper (c) \nReserves: Andrew Ready, Taniela Tupou, Sef Fa’agase, Izack Rodda, Hendrik Tui, James Tuttle, Jake McIntyre, Izaia Perese \nReferee: Federico Anselmi (ARG) 2:30 \nCHIEFS v BLUES in Hamilton, Friday 5.35pm AEDT \nBLUES coach Tana Umaga has named an unchanged starting line-up for Friday’s derby at Waikato Stadium. \nUmaga has, however, had the luxury of calling up All Blacks stars Jerome Kaino and Patrick Tuipulotu to add to an already powerful bench. \nFlanker Kaino missed the opening round in part because he was mourning the death of close friend Sione Lauaki, while lock Tuipulotu is back on deck after being cleared of a doping irregularity. \nThe Blues bench includes six All Blacks, a Maori All Black and a New Zealand under-20s player to comprise the reserves bench. \nLock Jimmy Tupou will again lead the Blues, who are still missing injured quintet Alex Hodgman, Sam Nock, Declan O’Donnell, Stephen Perofeta and Sonny Bill Williams. \nBoth the Blues and the Chiefs posted impressive first-round wins, over the Rebels and Highlanders respectively. \nCHIEFS (TBC): \nBLUES (15-1): Michael Collins, Matt Duffie, Rieko Ioane, Piers Francis, Melani Nanai, Ihaia West, Augustine Pulu, Akira Ioane, Blake Gibson, Steven Luatua, Gerard Cowley-Tuioti, Jimmy Tupou (c), Sione Mafileo, Matt Moulds, Pauliasi Manu \nReserves: Hame Faiva, Ofa Tu’ungafasi, Charlie Faumuina, Patrick Tuipulotu, Jerome Kaino, Billy Guyton, George Moala, Rene Ranger \nReferee: Ben O’Keeffe (NZ) Savea channels Lomu in Tokyo 0:46 \nHURRICANES v REBELS in Wellington, Saturday 3.15pm AEDT \nHURRICANES (TBC):", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:02:20.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
