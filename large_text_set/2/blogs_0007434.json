This very rare condition—which is caused by repeated head trauma—leads to long-term brain degeneration. Experts believe CTE causes parts of the brain to atrophy, or waste away, which harms communication between brain cells. This can lead to CTE symptoms like difficulty thinking, impulsive behavior, depression , memory loss, emotional instability, or suicidal thoughts or behavior, according to the Mayo Clinic. \nFootball players and boxers are at particular risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, but those who play other contact sports, like soccer, wrestling, rugby, lacrosse, and hockey, likely up their odds of experiencing it, too. \nNot all people with repeated concussions go on to develop CTE, the Mayo Clinic notes. \nThere are still a lot of questions with chronic traumatic encephalopathy—and because it can only be diagnosed by autopsy, research on the condition is very important. \n“Brain bank research is an essential step in learning to prevent and treat CTE, and has provided insights that have launched multiple studies at the Boston University CTE Center focused on developing diagnostics and therapeutics,” said Concussion Legacy Foundation cofounder Chris Nowinski in a press release . \nResearchers one day hope to use a range of tests, including brain imaging and biomarkers, to help diagnose CTE. While experts are studying possibilities for diagnose and treatment, avoiding head injury remains the best preventive strategy, the Mayo Clinic says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:46:14.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
