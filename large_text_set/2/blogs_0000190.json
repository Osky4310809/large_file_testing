Some supporters, including the bill’s sponsor, expressed concern about taking a position that has been widely criticized as endangering the rights of LGBT people.\nDescribing the bill as “something that has weighed a great deal on me,” the sponsor, Del. Nicholas Freitas (R-Culpeper), said he would prefer to “get the government out of the definition of marriage.”\nBut because Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) signed an executive order last month barring state agencies from doing business with companies that discriminate against people based on sexual orientation, Freitas said he felt compelled to act.\nHanging over the debate was the ridicule and condemnation some states have received for actions seen as restricting same-sex marriage or the rights of those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.\nMcAuliffe regularly uses North Carolina and its struggles with a “bathroom bill” as the boogeyman in warning lawmakers not to pass restrictions that will hurt the state’s ability to attract businesses and create jobs.\n[ In Virginia, Republican-led committee kills transgender ‘bathroom bill’]\n“With the legislation we have before us, we’re actually poking a sore that none of us want to poke,” said Del. Bobby Orrock (R-Caroline), who said he had prayed about what to do. He had decided to support it, he said, “with some hesitancy about how this will be phrased in certain quarters.”\nOrrock said he supported the bill simply as a counter to what he considered McAuliffe’s overreach in issuing the executive order.\n“Do NOT see this measure as Virginia taking a position in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling” legalizing same-sex marriage, he said.\n“I appreciate the fact that some of y’all on the other side are wrestling with this issue,” said one of the bill’s most ardent opponents, Del. Marcus Simon (D-Fairfax). But he cautioned that beyond the moral question of supporting same-sex marriage, the bill raised a constitutional issue by carving out special protection for a specific religious belief.\n“That is essentially establishing a state religion,” he said. “It’s wrong. It’s wrong for the message it sends, and it’s also bad policy.”\nDel. Vivian Watts (D-Fairfax) said the bill’s purpose of shielding organizations from being punished for refusing to perform same-sex marriages had nothing to do with McAuliffe’s executive order, which was aimed at state contractors.\n“This bill is an overreaction,” she said.\nThe measure now goes to the state Senate.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@SchneiderG"], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:24:15.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
