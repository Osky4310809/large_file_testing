Credit: Christian Adams for The Telegraph \nI n a second major policy u-turn the Labour leader announced his support for a \"maximum earnings\" limit on Tuesday morning only to abandon the policy just hours after proposing it. \nHe backtracked on the plans just hours later after they were dismissed by his own former economic adviser as a \"lunatic idea\" and \"completely unworkable\". \nA spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he \"mispoke\" and the Labour leader later called instead for executives at companies with Government contracts to be limited to earning 20 times more than their most junior staff. \nThe Labour leader also called for a new top rate of income tax for those earning above £70,000, claiming it would make society fairer.

The shadow minister said: \"There's no doubt about it, today has looked like a disaster. \n\"Within a day we've been forced to backtrack on a surprise call fro the leader to cap the wages of high-earners and the suggestion we were actually taking a tougher line on free movement.\" \nStephen Kinnock, a Labour MP who has called for greater controls, said: \"These mixed messages are deeply corrosive to our standing in the country. If we want to be a credible opposition we have got to have clarity. \"I think that it really is time for Jeremy to level with the British people, it is frustrating that we haven't managed to clarify the position today.\" \nMr Corbyn's speech on Tuesday afternoon had been intended to end the confusion surrounding his stance on migration after bitter clashes with his shadow cabinet. \nTom Watson, Labour's deputy leader, admitted at the weekend that the party does not have a position and said that Jeremy Corbyn must address the concerns of voters calling for migration curbs. Watch | Corbyn: There's no sea change on freedom of movement 02:04 \nH owever in a series of interviews on Tuesday morning he said that he was not willing to put limits on migration, and suggested he was prepared to accept free movement in return for access to the Single Market. \n\"If the EU says access to the single market requires freedom of movement, I would say... economically we've got to be able to trade with Europe,\" Mr Corbyn told ITV's Good Morning Britain. \nAsked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether he had a number in mind for what level of immigration would be acceptable, Mr Corbyn said: \"I am not putting a figure on it.\" \nWhen he delivered his speech in Peterborough on Tuesday afternoon, he added a significant caveat. \"Labour is not wedded to freedom of movement for EU citizens as a point of principle, but I don’t want that to be misinterpreted, nor do we rule it out,\" he said. Watch | Jeremy Corbyn 'reboot' fails as he calls for high-earnings cap 00:42 \nM r Corbyn added to the chaos by calling for a Cuba-style maximum wage, adding that it would be \"somewhat higher\" than the £138,000 he earns. \nHe suggested it could apply to football players and company executives. He said: \"I think, certainly, the salaries that are paid to some footballers are simply ridiculous. I think some of the salaries paid to very high-earning top executives of companies are utterly ridiculous.\" \nHe said other countries had developed policies on a maximum wage. However, the only state thought to have one in force is Cuba – where it has been set at 20 US dollars a month.

And he told hard-pressed commuters affected by strikes that he would stand on the picket lines with the union bosses making their lives a misery. \n\"Labour simply could not be more out of touch with ordinary working people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:06:30.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
