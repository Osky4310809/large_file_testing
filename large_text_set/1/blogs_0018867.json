His paintings of Disney characters have been featured at multiple Disney art festivals, onboard Disney Cruise Line ships, and here on the Disney Parks Blog , and now he is creating new pieces live as a visiting artist at the Epcot International Festival of the Arts.\nJoe is a self-taught artist whose love of Disney characters inspired him to pick up a paintbrush in his free time, after he puts down his pen from his job as an advertising copywriter for Disney Parks and Resorts. His favorite Disney character to draw? Mickey Mouse , of course!\nJoe told me that his favorite part of starting a new piece of art is the fun and spontaneity that comes with creating it. “There are no rules, it’s just fun, and that’s the magic of the whole thing” Joe said. \nHere’s a look at how Joe creates new pieces:\n\nSee Joe in action every Saturday during the festival from 7-9pm, and be sure to check the festival schedule here and plan to see your other favorite artists in the weekends ahead!\nThe Epcot International Festival of the Arts takes place each weekend now through February 20, 2017. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:42:51.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
