Malloy would not want the law followed as enacted by Congress or by the Connecticut legislature in any fashion seems to be concerning, right?” Spicer began. “You, you, whether you’re a governor or a mayor or the president, laws are passed in this country and we expect people and our lawmakers and our law enforcement agencies to follow and adhere to the laws as passed by the appropriate level of government.”   \n“So it’s obviously concerning, I think, and it’s troubling that that’s the message that he would send to his people and to other governors,” he continued. \n“The president has been very clear on this, that if you are a sanctuary city, declared or undeclared, if you are providing benefits or services, we are gonna do everything we can to respect taxpayers and insure that your states follow the law,” Spicer said. \nYou can watch Spicer make his remarks about Gov. Malloy here, courtesy of Fox News . \nTo be sure, there is often an argument to made about individual states standing up for their rights in opposition to an overreaching federal government involving itself in affairs best left to the states to handle on their own.
