Shares \nThe second Deus Ex: Mankind Divided story DLC, entitled A Criminal Past, will send hero Adam Jensen off to the sunny climes of Arizona to go undercover in a high-security, augs-only prison. The mission: to make contact with another operative who went in before him and has since \"gone dark,\" and retrieve the information he carries. \nA Criminal Past will take place during Jensen's first mission for Task Force 29, before the events of Mankind Divided. A successful extraction of the sensitive data will help in the fight against terror around the world, \"but Jensen will need to confront a darker side to his role before the day is done,\" the announcement says. The mission will feature a return of Dr. Delara Auzenne, the TF29 psychiatrist, who for reasons of spoiler protection we will discuss no further. \nDeus Ex: Mankind Divided – A Criminal Past will be out on February 23. Pricing hasn't been announced, but the first story DLC, System Rift, goes for $12/£9.50/€12 , so I'd expect something similar.
