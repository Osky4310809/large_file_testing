By: FE Online | Published: February 6, 2017 3:28 PM Dangal’s box office success means little to Aamir Khan. (PTI) \nDangal box office collections : Aamir Khan might be sitting at the top spot of the Bollywood box office, a head above competition, but the star revealed that such achievements mean very little to him. He explained that it wasn’t money that mattered to him, but love – whether his wife Kiran Rao was on the receiving end of it or his films’ scripts. Aamir recently told Hindustan Times, “I am not a box-office king. I am only Kiran’s king.” Aamir Khan’s Dangal not only broke all kinds of Bollywood records, but even toppled Salman Khan ’s Sultan, Bajrangi Bhaijaan and his own earlier offering PK. \nBut what makes Aamir take up a film? It turns out, it’s just the ones that speak to him more. “Till today I never signed a film on the basis of its capability to do business. I prefer to choose a film from my heart. All the films I’ve done till now are those which touched my heart. Taare Zameen Par, 3 Idiots, Rang De Basanti or Sarfarosh, when I did those films, I never thought they would do such a good business. If you take Dangal as an example, I played a role of an aged and heavy wrestler. There are no romantic songs or any typical formula to become a blockbuster. Therefore, we never predicted that the film would be such a big hit,” he explained. \nYou might like to watch: \nDangal’s performance at the box office goes contrary to usual Bollywood formulas, but if the recent successes and flops are anything to go by, then the only formula that seems to work lately is, ironically, that film which has no formula. Audiences are more cued into films with unique plots like Neerja or even Dear Zindagi. While the formulaic films (a complaint that Shahrukh Khan often faces) do well enough at the box office, they aren’t necessarily the ones that that break records.
