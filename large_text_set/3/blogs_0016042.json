Jackson ‘Love Child’ Demands Meeting With Pop Star 'If she has a conscience … I believe she will step forward.' Posted on Mar 20, 2017 @ 6:55AM \nThe woman at the center of the Janet Jackson love child scandal is begging for a meeting with the iconic singer , RadarOnline.com has learned, after years of mystery and scandal surrounding the truth about her parents. \n“If she has a conscience and she wants to get this off her chest, then I believe she will step forward, reach out to me,” Philadelphia woman Tiffany Whyte told Radar. “Let me know what’s going on. Let me know who you are.” \nAs Radar reported, Whyte claims she is the love child of Jackson and ex-husband, James DeBarge . Jackson – who welcomed a son, Eissa , with husband Wissam al Mana in January – has never commented on the claims that she abandoned a child fathered by DeBarge years ago. DeBarge himself has been insistent that he believes an heir is out there. \nNow, after taking a DNA test with DeBarge to prove who her parents really are, Whyte says it’s time for Jackson to set the record straight. \n“Mother, I miss you I love you and I’ve been waiting for this moment for 31 years,” Whyte said in a heartbreaking plea to the woman she believes is her mom. \nPHOTOS: I’m Janet Jackson’s Secret Daughter!
