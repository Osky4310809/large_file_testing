In recent times, the media reported about an unidentified governor in the Niger Delta who diverted $10million out of the bail out fund given to his state. \nOn Sunday, Saharareporters reported that Nigerian State Governors, Senate President Saraki Pocketed Billions of Naira from Paris Loan Refund. \nThe EFCC has now cleared the air that investigation about the fund has just begun, \n“The Commission implores the Media to be circumspect in the reportage of this delicate issue in order not to jeopardize ongoing investigation, and be assured that they would be fully briefed of developments as soon as breakthrough is achieved”, said Wilson Uwujaren, the spokesman of the commission.
