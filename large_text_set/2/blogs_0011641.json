That was all the detail we got at the time, but now we at least know when the event will take place, and it couldn’t be a more perfect date: March 8, International Women’s Day.\nThough the organizers reportedly met with those behind the general strike planned for February 17, it seems that the two events won’t be teaming up. We also still don’t know exactly what the strike will entail, especially considering that there are logistical considerations around people’s jobs that make a strike harder to pull off than a march.\nWe should know more in the relatively near future, not just because March 8 isn’t that far away, but because the Women’s March Twitter account also mentioned , “Over the next few weeks we will be sharing more information on what actions on March 8th can look like for you.”\n(image via Women’s March)\nWant more stories like this?
