(Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports) 123 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAccording to a report from ESPN released late Sunday night, the Golden State Warriors were \"furious and bewildered\" by the way that the Thunder handled Kevin Durant's initial return to Oklahoma City on Feb. 11. \nAccording to Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, that wasn't the case. \n\"I don't agree (with the report),\" Kerr told reporters at shootaround in Oklahoma City on Monday, adding that he has yet to read the story. \"(Thunder GM) Sam Presti's a friend of mine. I know (Thunder owner) Clay Bennett. It's a class organization all the way, so I don't really pay any attention to a story like that unless there's an actual name that's put on it.\" \nThe report, which cited league sources, claimed that the Warriors felt as though someone from the Thunder organization should have addressed the media prior to Durant's return to \"help ease the tension\" and that their failure to do so \"contributed to the raw emotions\" that led to an \"unsettling, hostile atmosphere\" during the game, which was Durant's first time playing in the city he called home for nearly a decade after leaving for The Bay in July. Steve Kerr calls Sam Presti a friend and the Thunder a \"first-class\" organization, disputes ESPN report pic.twitter.com/dhPpiEwKCl — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) March 20, 2017 \n\"I assume (the story is) just sources?\" Kerr asked. \"I don't know who (the source) is. It's nobody with the Warriors. We have great respect for the Thunder — Sam's been a friend of mine forever. They're first class. So I don't know where that comes from.\" \nWarriors point guard Stephen Curry also addressed the report, which he seemed to find some humor in. \n\"Certain stories that don't need to see the light of day, don't need to have any life breathed into them, somehow are the most popular,\" Curry said. \"That's kind of how it goes. To me it's kind of comical what can be put under the spotlight during an 82-game year, when at the end of the day, we're all just trying to win games and enjoy what we do for a living.\" \nThe Warriors and Thunder face off for the fourth and final time of the season on Monday night, though Durant won't be on the floor as he continues to nurse a Grade 2 MCL sprain suffered on Feb. 28. He did, however, travel with the team, and was seen riding a stationary bike after shootaround . \nThe Warriors, who won the first three meetings with the Thunder by a combined 63 points, lost five of their first seven games after Durant went down, but have since won three straight and look to be back on track for the final stretch of the season. \nFollow AJ Neuharth-Keusch on Twitter @tweetAJNK Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
