The manager, as you saw from his press conference, was obviously gutted as well,\" he told Sky Sports News HQ. \n\"He didn't want to get rid of Dimi, but he wanted to get rid of the situation. Obviously we had to deal with all of that and the best way to do that was by winning games, that's what we've done. \n\"It was a tough time for all of us. But it has become a happy place again.\" poll loading Who will have the last laugh? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T22:02:27.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
