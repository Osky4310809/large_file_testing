War did!\" \nThe Indian cricketer later shared a picture of himself posing in a manner similar to Kaur's, with a message on a placard that read, \"I didn't score two triple centuries, my bat did.\" \nThe post, which tickled Hooda's funnybone, earned applause from the actor. Within no time Hooda and Sehwag were referred to as 'bullies' by social media users and were bashed for being insensitive towards the martyr's daughter. Soon Hooda took to Facebook to clarify his stance saying that he wasn't being insensitive to the daughter of a soldier, who gave his life for the country. Randeep Hooda. Image from News 18. \nHooda made himself unavailable during the controversy and instead told us to refer to his Facebook post. \nHowever, he now opens up about the row to Firstpost , saying, “The issue was blown out of proportion. But I realised that I should have been careful because of the environment that exists in our country vis-a-vis women. I saw Sehwag's tweet... I often laugh on his jokes. I laughed at the joke in isolation, it wasn’t connected or directed at Gurmehar. I didn’t know who she was in first place. I didn't know the connotation of it. I started getting messages and some prominent journalists were commenting on it. I quickly went back on Twitter and saw what's happening.\" \n\"I very precisely said that do not politicise this poor girl's point of view and those two words were taken - poor and girl - then they said you are a misogynist and sexist. I realised where it was headed, what were the political ideologies and I know from experience what was going to happen. If you go through my tweets — actually most people are reacting to the headlines that people have put up. Nobody has read the tweets, there was nothing abusive in them. It was merely conversation between me and those journalists, which turned this into a whole fiasco. And how did it turn into such a big thing if it was not already on the agenda?” \nHooda further went on to say that he has always been targeted whenever he has put out his opinion on social media. \nThe Sarbjit actor said, “I have been labelled before. When I spoke up about Gurgaon being changed to Gurugram, they labeled me with all kind of things and I got a lecture on Sanskriti in not such polite terms. I spoke about Sanjay Leela Bhansali and the violence against him, I said hinsa galat hai , we can discuss the issue, haath nahi utha sakte . Again, another set of people trolled me.\" \nHooda also stated that trolling has now become a major issue. He added, \"It seems to me that we are not having a conversation anymore. We tend to get abusive while trolling. You can have your point of view and you can disagree. It's a democracy.” He continued, “Remove me and Sehwag from the situation. We are not affected by the kind of abuses we get. Put us aside even if we have worked hard to reach here after 20 years. The same threats were given to my mother and sister as well as to Sehwag's family members. Even Babita, Geeta Phogat and my colleagues Richa Chadha and Pooja Bhatt were not spared.\" \n\"Whether it's a man or a woman, it's wrong to troll. It's a crime and you can not threaten a woman on social media or anywhere else. It has to be addressed. The social media head of India should look into it as it's becoming a major issue,\" he added. \nIncidentally, Randeep also slammed those trolling Karan Johar and Kangana Ranaut, who recently had a fall-out over the latter calling Johar the ‘flag bearer of nepotism’ on his chat show, Koffee With Karan . \n“Both, Karan and Kangana are entitled to their opinion. Both are quite similar actually. Both of them can fight it out, we don’t have to be part of their conversation. At least I don’t want to be part of their conversation. Again there is trolling happening. If there is conversation happening between Karan and Kangana, why is everybody jumping into it and calling them names? Am sure they are calling them names and it is getting abusive. That is what we need to control. We have stopped being a nation which has conversation. If we don’t have a conversation, if we don’t listen to the other person’s point of view then how can we run a democracy? Unless we respond with our reasoning it is not going to work. It is going to be partisan.” \nThis brings us to the debate of nepotism as Randeep, like Kangana, is also considered to be an ‘outsider’ with no industry connections. Both have made it big in Bollywood without any backing or support. Randeep Hooda in his look from Battle of Saragarhi. Image from twitter. \n“There is nepotism and there is also not. If you are talented, nobody can pull you down. That is for sure. And Kangana is a great talent; she has really done well for herself,” said Hooda. \nTalking about his upcoming project, Hooda, who is known for going that extra mile for his films, will be seen playing the role of Havildar Ishar Singh, the military commander of the 36th Sikhs in the movie, Battle of Saragarhi that took place in 1897 between British Indian Army and Afghan Orakzai tribesmen in the North-West Frontier Province. \nThis Raj Kumar Santoshi-helmed period drama will depict the true story of the 19th century battle when around 12,000 Afghans attacked a British Indian contingent, which also comprised 21 Sikhs who went on to become the heroes of the mission. As part of his preparation, the actor, who is already a master of horse-riding, studied Sikh history, learnt sword-fighting and vintage-rifle shooting. \nLast year, Hooda had shocked everyone with his emaciated look in Sarbjit, and it may be recalled that Twitterati had bashed certain prominent Awards’ organisers for him not getting a single nomination for the film. \n“My approach towards my work has always been to enjoy the process. Even when I was doing theatre, I used to enjoy the rehearsals more than the actual staging of the play. The kind of work and exploration I do, that for me is the biggest reward. If I don’t get an award, it doesn’t change the credibility of my performance and if I get an award it doesn’t make it better. So both ways, it is of no consequence to me. It is people’s opinion. It is more like the game of golf where you have to better yourself. It is not a boxing match where you have to compete against other people,\" said Hooda. \n 26  26 am Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T12:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T08:11:10.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
