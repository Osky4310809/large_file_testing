We may think it's weather-related, or blame our type of skin, but we tend to ignore that it could be our own actions that are leading to this unhealthy skin predicament. From using the wrong cleansers and make-up products, to over-doing certain beauty practices, here are five mistakes we're making that lead to dry skin. Over-exfoliating and cleansing \nOne of the most common mistakes people make, that leads to dry skin, is over-exfoliating and washing. Exfoliation is only advised once or maximum two-three times a week, because the practice literally scrubs dead skin cells off your face. Over-exfoliating can majorly dry out your skin, so keep a check of how often you do it. \nSimilarly, over-cleansing too strips your skin of vital oils and moisture, and leads to dry, flaky skin. It is not necessary to wash your face with a cleanser or a face wash, multiple times in a day. When your face is clean, even a splash of water is enough. The most essential time to use a cleansing product to wash your face is at the end of the day, or after you've been exposed to dirt or sun for an extended period of time. Also, using a cleanser that is right for your skin type is very important. If you're using a cleanser that is not specific to your skin type, it could wreak even more havoc on your skin. You use powder make-up products, or products that are too matte-fying \nIf your skin has an affinity to become dry, try to stay away from make-up products that can dry it out further. This includes matte-fying primers, foundations, powder products and, of course, matte lipsticks. All of these products will only draw out more moisture from your skin, leaving it very dry and unpleasant. Sleeping with your make-up on \nA beauty tip that we will always preach is removing your make-up before you hit the sack. It not only clogs your pores, but irritates your skin and dries it out, too. So make sure you take it all off before you go to bed, right down to that stubborn mascara. Having a bath with very hot water \nHot water baths may feel great, but what you don't understand is that the high temperature strips your skin of its essential oils and moisturisers. And this leaves your skin unnecessarily dry and dehydrated. Lower the temperature of your shower, and see the difference. Using beauty and make-up products that have alcohol \nIf you're prone to dry skin, or even if you're not, using products with alcohol or astringents can lead to major dryness. The alcohol in these products robs your skin of moisture and natural oils. So, use alcohol-free cleansers, like micellar water or bi-phase water and oil cleansers, instead.
