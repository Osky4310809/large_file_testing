We have Jeff Reine-Adelaide, we have of course Ainsley Maitland-Niles , we have Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Alex Iwobi can play in there. Elneny will come back after Sunday, so I still have some strengths. \non whether he regrets not having a recall option on Jack Wilshere … No. We have agreed for him to go for one year on loan and we will accept that. \non whether he could do with having Jack available… Well, yes. But when you consider the problems of the year, I would like to reiterate that we didn’t push him out. He wanted to go somewhere and play and I agreed with that. He wanted to go because he saw the level of the competitive players we had in midfield and let’s not forget we have as well Xhaka suspended, so there’s a huge level of competition. I accepted to let him go and we have to deal with the consequences of that. \nMore polls coming soon!
