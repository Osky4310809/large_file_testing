It was the third-longest drive of the day, behind Roberto Castro’s 407-yard drive that led the field. In fact, it wasn’t even the longest drive Mickelson has ever hit on the PGA Tour . \n“I've done it, but it's been off the cart path,” he smiled. “[No.] 17 at Doral I hit the cart path and it was over 400 [yards].” \nActually, that drive in 2013 at this same event flew 450 yards during the first round and was the longest on Tour that season. It also included a better ending for Mickelson, who made birdie at the 17th hole in ’13, but bogeyed the fourth on Thursday in Mexico after chipping out of the trees and failing to get up and down.
