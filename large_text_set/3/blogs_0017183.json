And instead of simply existing as a way to get your eyelids or lips extra sleek, the glossy hair trend is the “fresh out of the shower” equivalent of its makeup counterparts. Who better to exemplify this trend than Chloë Grace Moretz, whose slicked-back hair is giving us major hair goals. The actress took to the trend in a rather chill way, wearing her short hair brushed back with some circle frames, a denim jacket and black denim shorts. This isn’t the sort of hair trend that’s supposed to be high maintenance, in fact, we’d argue it’s the opposite! Simply get out of the shower, slick your hair back, finish with pomade or gel for texture and hold, and you’re set.\nI'm the west in south by \nA post shared by Chloe Grace Moretz (@chloegmoretz) on Mar 15, 2017 at 11:42am PDT \nLittle @ethanmoretz and I take sxsw feat 5th wave reunion \nA post shared by Chloe Grace Moretz (@chloegmoretz) on Mar 14, 2017 at 11:53am PDT \n#humble ( humbled!) #generous #compliment #amazing #rebel @chloegmoretz ❤️ ️ @gregoryrussellhair #iconicshapes #lorrigoddardcolor @uberliss \nA post shared by Lorri Goddard (@lorrigoddard_) on Mar 9, 2017 at 7:30pm PST \nWe love the western flair this look has, it’s the perfect mix of cool and nonchalant, which could just sum up Chloë’s style in general. The best part about this hair trend is that it’s virtually impossible to mess up. Haven’t showered in five days? Perfect, even better! This takes the idea of bedhead to another level. But thanks to the uniform style, it still has just the right pinch of polish.\n@lorrigoddard_ @gregoryrussellhair \nA post shared by Chloe Grace Moretz (@chloegmoretz) on Mar 11, 2017 at 4:48pm PST \nWe know what hairstyle we’ll be wearing on our next lazy Monday.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:09:30.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
