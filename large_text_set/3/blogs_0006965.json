Hopefully one day we’ll see a biopic of them on the big screen. \nTriêu Thi Trinh \nIt’s said that the 20-year-old Vietnamese warrior was 9 feet tall with a voice as loud as a temple bell. The legend also details her glorious rides into battle on an elephant, dressed in bright yellow and wielding two swords. \nNot only were her battle skills incomparable, so were her speeches. For example, she said: “I only want to ride the wind and walk the waves, slay the big whales of the Eastern sea, clean up our frontiers, and save the people from drowning. Why should I imitate others, bow my head, stoop over and be a slave? Why resign myself to menial housework?” \nAmen, Thi Trinh, amen. 2 \nSadie the Goat \nShe may have been small, but she was one petite pirate who knew how to kick some ass. She earned her nickname in 1860s New York by not only mugging people, but head-butting them afterwards. When one mugging turned into a giant brawl with Gallus Mag (a female bouncer who bit Sadie’s ear off), Sadie escaped to the Hudson River with just a few crew members she hastily pulled together. \nThat summer she led her crew and did things like swashbuckling and pillaging waterside mansions, but she finally got to reunite with her ear since Mag had preserved it in a pickling jar… for whatever reason. 3 \nAmalie “Emmy” Noether \nThe German Jewish mathematician was called a genius by Albert Einstein . She is known for her contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics, but it was a hard journey to get there. 20th-century Bavaria wasn’t exactly the easiest place for a woman to get a decent education. In fact, women weren’t even allowed to enroll in the university, so Noether had to go to each professor and petition for a spot in their class. \nWhen she graduated she landed a job as a teacher… on the grounds that she wouldn’t be paid. Her dedication shown through when she worked under those conditions for 15 years. She also fled the Nazis and became friends with Einstein. Remember how I said he called her a genius? His eulogy for her when she died went like this: “In the judgment of the most competent living mathematicians, Fraulein Noether was the most significant creative mathematical genius thus far produced since the higher education of women began.” 4 \nKittie Smith \nSmith was an awesome sideshow performer. She could write, paint, sew, play piano and do woodwork… without any hands. Actually, she didn’t even have arms because her abusive father burnt them beyond repair when she was nine years old. After that, Smith persevered and after rehabilitation and an education she became a great performer (lovingly called the Armless Dynamo) and author, even forgiving her father in a memoir. 5 \nStephanie “Queenie” St. Clair \nKnown as the Queen of Harlem, St. Clair made the neighborhood her home after she emigrated to the US in 1912. Twenty years later she ran the damn place with a crew that protected the residents with a fierce passion. She had corrupt cops thrown out of the police force, and when Bronx crime boss Dutch Schultz made his move into her territory, she forged alliances that later led to his assassination. Afterwards she left a letter on his deathbed that read “As ye sow, so shall ye reap.” \nYou can see her as a supporting character in films like Hoodlum and The Cotton Club , but she’d be a great leading lady, don’t you think? Advertisement 6 \nKate Chopin \nSeveral of Chopin’s 19th-century works have been turned into screenplays, but her life is interesting in itself. Happily married with six children in the 1880s, everything changed for Chopin when both her husband and mother died in the same year. Living as a widow on a Louisiana plantation, Chopin’s doctor convinced her that writing would be a great outlet for her deep depression so that she could work through her grief. \nHer short stories and essays proved to not only save her life through her passion for writing, she also pulled her family out of financial ruin. Her novel The Awakening got terrible reviews when she first released it in 1899, but now it’s considered a masterpiece and trailblazer for feminine literature. 7 \nHedy Lamarr \nLamarr was a glamorous Hollywood starlet as well as an innovative inventor. After escaping from her abusive arms-dealing husband, she went about attempting to defeat the Nazis through applied sciences. \nShe and her composer friend George Antheil developed “frequency hopping,” an advancement in torpedo systems that aimed to make them jam-proof. The Navy didn’t really start using the technology until the 1960s, but Lamarr’s contributions later got recognition as her discoveries paved the way for widespread adoption of wireless communications. You know, the thing that cell phones and Wi-Fi use. At 83, Lamarr was honored with the Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award as well as the BULBIE™ Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award, also regarded as “the Oscar of Inventing.” 8 \nThe Night Witches \nOver the course of three years in WWII, a group of young women (ages 17-26) called the Night Bomber Regiment of the Soviet Air Forces flew 30,000 missions and dropped 23,000 tons of bombs on invading Nazis. What’s even crazier is that they preferred flying at night (hence the name) and flew planes made out of plywood and canvas so they could quietly sneak up on the Germans. 9 \nMary Blaire \nBlaire was a truly gifted painter whose vibrant imagination created the imagery of an entire generation of Disney animation, such as The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad , Peter Pan , Alice in Wonderland and Cinderella. Originally she wanted to go into the fine arts, but the Depression drove her to animation. It was in that profession that she found her passion for color and made groundbreaking designs. \nIn fact, it’s Blair who is credited with introducing Walt Disney to modern art. Disney even consulted her while he designed the famous “It’s a Small World” ride. 10 \nJosephine Baker \nBaker was known for her flirty dance routines and sparkling personality, but no story about Baker would be complete without her history of espionage. During WWII the French Resistance recruited Baker to be a spy. Her acceptance sounds like it came straight from a movie: “France made me what I am. I will be grateful forever. The people of Paris have given me everything. They have given me their hearts, and I have given them mine. I am ready, Captain, to give my life. You can use me as you wish.” \nSince she was so beautiful and famous, no one thought twice about her being a spy. She was able to secure information from high-ranking Axis officials thanks to her international acclaim. To make things even better, she trained in karate and was apparently such a great shot with a pistol that she could take out a candle flame. She hid notes in her underwear and delivered messages with invisible ink on music pages. \nApart from narrowly escaping Nazi forces, having a tumultuous relationship with her intelligence contact Jacques Abtey and being decorated for valor by General Charles de Gaulle, she still managed to maintain her awesome career as a performer.
