We apologize for any undue conclusions that might have been drawn from the report.” \nThe story was later pulled entirely. \nThe website Business Insider broke the story of the suspensions, and published a statement from IJR founder Alex Skatell.   \n“We are committed to an editorial team that includes voices, perspectives and geographies that span the country but equally committed to quality standards in our newsroom. As we’ve grown, we’ve sought to improve on that front and last month we launched our six-person editorial operations team along with enforcement and review for all editorial content,” Skatell said in the statement. \n“Last week we got it wrong and ultimately deserve all the criticism if we want to be taken seriously. As a result of last week’s failure, Kyle Becker has been suspended indefinitely as well as his supervisor and chief content officer Benny Johnson and the content editor approving the post, Becca Lower,” the statement added. \n“We are reviewing all the details to determine if further action is necessary. This ultimately falls on me to get it right and we have to do better in the future,” the statement said. \nBusiness Insider reported that Joe Perticone, who had been the congressional reporter for IJR, severed his association with the site over the post.
