Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nReal Madrid set a new Spanish record by making it 40 games unbeaten - but they were made to work for it by Sevilla. \nLos Blanco trailed 3-1 with just eight minutes remaining at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, with Jorge Sampaoli's men dreaming of their own unlikely Copa del Rey comeback. \nBut then a clumsy shove on Casemiro allowed Sergio Ramos - back on home turf - to chip in from the penalty spot, before Karim Benzema struck even later in the day, to ensure the continuation of a streak that dates back to a Champions League last eight loss to Wolfburg last season. Sergio Ramos celebrates his goal (Photo: REUTERS) \nWith both sides making a number of changes, Sevilla started brightly and were rewarded when Danilo inexplicably headed into his own net just 10 minutes in. \nThe hosts failed to add to their advantage despite enjoying plenty of chances before half-time and were punished when Asensio ran almost the entire length of the field to put the tie beyond doubt three minutes into the second-half. \nSevilla then needed to score five, but bravely fought on with the attacking intent that has characterised their season and finally brought Madrid's unbeaten streak to an end. \nJovetic volleyed home Sergio Escudero's cross before captain Vicente Iborra forced the ball home from close range 13 minutes from time. \nHowever, Ramos returned to haunt his former club with coolly a taken Panenka six minutes later to secure Real's place in the last eight, before Benzema secured the record. 1. Madrid 40 not out It's been some effort (Photo: REUTERS) \nNo record seems beyond Zidane's relentless squad at the minute as they surpassed Barca's MSN-inspired 39-game run without defeat last season to set a new record mark in Spanish football. \nOne of the few feats to have evaded Real throughout their storied history is a treble of league, Cup and Champions League. \nZidane admitted on Wednesday the treble has to be Madrid's target, and whilst it is highly unlikely they will extend their unbeaten record throughout the entire season, there is no reason why more history and five trophies, including the already claimed UEFA Super Cup and World Club Cup, should be beyond the European champions this season. 2. Both have eyes on crunch Liga clash Marco Asensio started - and starred (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nWell before kick-off it was clear to see that both Zidane and Sevilla boss Jorge Sampaoli saw Sunday's La Liga clash between the two back at the Pizjuan as their priority. \nAs well as leaving out Ronaldo, Zidane left Luka Modric back in Madrid, whilst Sampaoli handed a rest to a series of key men including Samir Nasri, Steven N'Zonzi and Vitolo. \nReal's second visit to Andalucia in four days will be the acid test for Sevilla's title challenge. Win again and they will be just one point adrift of the league leaders. \nFor Madrid, even with 20 games for the chasing pack to come at the weekend, a return to winning ways would be a huge stepping stone towards a first Liga title in five years. 3. Zidane shows Ronaldo who's boss Zidane again left Ronaldo out - he continues to do things his way (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nWhilst praise has sometimes been slow to come and begrudging towards Zidane given the squad at his disposal, there is no doubt he has succeeded where other far more experienced coaches have failed in getting Ronaldo to sit on the sidelines for his own good. \nJose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Rafael Benitez all struggled to control Ronaldo's relentless thirst for more minutes and more goals. \nZidane admitted towards the end of last season he had been wrong not to limit Ronaldo's playing time as an injury scare saw him miss the Champions League semi-final, first leg at Manchester City and play the final clearly less than 100 percent. \nHe has learned from that experience as once again Ronaldo wasn't even included in his matchday squad to ensure he is fresh for Sunday's return to the Pizjuan. 4. Monchi does it again Stevan Jovetic netted on his debut (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nWhilst the rest of La Liga have been as busy in the transfer market as a London tube driver in the past few weeks, Sevilla's rightly heralded sporting director Monchi has been unearthing more value for money gems. \nFrench defender Clement Lenglet strolled through his debut at just 21 after completing a move from Nancy, whilst Jovetic showed the reason he has been recruited just two days since he joined on loan from Inter Milan. \nDespite resources that pale into insignificance compared to the vast majority of the Premier League, Monchi has continuously built squads capable of punching above their weight and competing to win trophies. \nSevilla's next Champions League opponents Leicester be warned, this squad looks as good as anything seen at the Pizjuan in the decade since Juande Ramos's side went to the brink of beating Barca and Madrid to the title in 2006/07. 5. Deadly Danilo Sevilla celebrate after Danilo's own goal (Photo: Getty Images) \nIt takes something to outdo Fabio Coentrao for most hapless member of the Madrid squad, but the dithering Danilo once again made his case. \nThe Brazilian has been a peripheral figure since being torn apart by Julian Draxler the last time Real lost back in April at Wolfsburg. \nYet, when given a rare chance he produced a towering back post header Alan Shearer would have been proud of. The only problem was it was into his net past the helpless Kiko Casilla.
