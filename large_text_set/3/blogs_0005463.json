In an act of political generosity, Tom Hanks sent a coffee machine to the press at the White House. While this isn’t the first time that Hanks has sent a coffee maker to White House reporters (he did so in 2004 and 2010), this time it seems particularly loaded due to President Trump’s attacks on the media .\nThe journalist Steve Holland from Reuters tweeted about the much-needed machine on March 2nd. And it sure does look like it will make a mighty fine cup of joe .\nThankx to @tomhanks for the new coffee machine for the schlubs in the WH press room. pic.twitter.com/DHVhowzd3L \n— Steve Holland (@steveholland1) March 2, 2017 Sheesh, as if Hanks wasn’t already the most-beloved actor in all of Hollywood.\nBut better than the swanky coffee maker — which People reported as looking like a Pasquini Espresso Machine (and they sell for $1,740 to $2,219, depending on the brand) — is the type writer-written message Hanks sent with it. It reads:\n“To the White House Press Corps Keep up the good fight for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.\nEspecially for the Truth part.” Here is the note @tomhanks sent with the coffee machine pic.twitter.com/vFo4m1OXxf \n— Steve Holland (@steveholland1) March 2, 2017 \nThe letter features the Bill Mauldin drawing of weary WWII soldiers coming home that included the caption, “Fresh, spirited American troops, flushed with victory, are bringing in thousands of hungry, ragged, battle-weary prisoners.” It shows the realities of war versus what was presented in the press at the time.\nHanks then shared the drawing on his Twitter account after the press corps received his gift. Artist Bill Mauldin got it right. Hanx. pic.twitter.com/3rnr6B3hJ6 \n— Tom Hanks (@tomhanks) March 2, 2017 As for the coffee, NPR’s Tamara Keith also thanked Hanks by sharing a video of her espresso being made, courtesy of the fancy contraption.\nThank you @tomhanks . The espresso is delicious and this machine is a little more idiot proof than the last. pic.twitter.com/ZJlJCIqLV0 \n— Tamara Keith (@tamarakeithNPR) March 2, 2017 And don’t worry, Keith’s video shows that Hanks’ letter with Mauldin’s drawing is hanging on the wall right by the machine as a reminder of the importance of truth in the press during this administration.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:21:26.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
