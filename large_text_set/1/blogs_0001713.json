The 1 inch crack seal on the resurfaced Stockwell corner towards Vauxhall is dangerous when wet. #cuttingcorners @lambeth_council pic.twitter.com/VfQmON3y31 — Chris Hoyle (@choyle1991) January 4, 2017 \nOn Wednesday, one rider spent five hours at St Thomas’ Hospital as she underwent an X-ray following a tumble. \nResearcher Millie Ross, 24, suffered a bruised hip, cut lip and a swollen cheek after she fell off her bike as she turned off Clapham Road towards South Lambeth Road. \nShe said: “I noticed the path was open for the first time so I decided to turn left and my back wheel came from under me. I landed straight on my face. \nBruised: Millie Ross came off her bike on the Cycle Superhighway in Stockwell \n“A guy cycling behind me stopped to help and so did a pedestrian. The guy cycled with me all the way to work to make sure I was ok then I decided to go to hospital. \n\"Fortunately I haven't broken any bones just cuts and bruises but I was in some pain. \n“At first I thought it was just incompetence on my part but having seen how many people this has happened to, it does make me feel it wasn’t my fault.” \nAnother man said on Reddit his father sustained a “smashed up face and knee” on Wednesday as up to 20 riders fell within as many minutes before sand was placed down. \nConference director William Russell, 34, was among the riders to fall off his bike. \nHe said: “Before I had time to react I was on the ground. It was very slippery but I don’t think it was paint, maybe oil or grease. \n“Whatever it was it was lethal. I’m not a useless rider, I have been doing it for years and clearly other cyclists have fallen as well. \n“It was the first time I noticed it was open. Sod’s law it isn’t fit for purpose when we can use it.” @TFL the cycle lane by Stockwell war memorial is covered in grease. We were falling like skittles this am, me included! Cc @LambethCyclists — Anne Fairweather (@AnneFairweather) December 12, 2016 \nThe probe comes after riders complained the Cycle Superhighway near Stockwell war memorial, where the path is, was “covered in grease”. \nRiders’ group Lambeth Cyclists said they have had reports a dozen cyclists had slipped “over a couple of months”. \nLast month, independent City of London councillor Anne Fairweather said cyclists nearby were “falling like skittles” more than a week before the path was opened.
