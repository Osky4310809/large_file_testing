The doodle depicts her with one of her most famous works, \"The Death of Cleopatra,\" which is housed in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC.\nLewis, whose Native American name was Wildfire, is perhaps best known for incorporating her own cultures into her Neoclassical style sculpture. She was born in 1844 and lived into the early years of the 20th century.\n\"Her work paid homage to the abolitionists and Civil War heroes of her day, including John Brown and Col. Robert Gould Shaw,\" Google's description of her reads . \"Decades later, Lewis' legacy continues to thrive through her art and the path she helped forge for women and artists of color.
