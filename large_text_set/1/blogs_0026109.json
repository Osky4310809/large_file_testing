When you have a political party that has come into an election without been prepared for governance; when you have a party that does not do its homework well; when you have a party that is yet to blend as a political party, then the recession is something that is bound to happen. \n“I must concede right away that there are challenges all over but then, things (the economy) would have been better probably, if PDP were in office.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T11:45:35.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
