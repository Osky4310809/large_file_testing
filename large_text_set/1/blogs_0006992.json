He blamed the report on intelligence agencies and news outlets like BuzzFeed and CNN, calling their decision to report on the claims “a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks.” CNN reported on the document’s existence, but Buzzfeed leaked the document itself in its entirety.\nHow Trump plans to move forward with his business \nThe President-elect said he plans to turn over his business to his sons and a longtime business executive, but will not sell it. According to a lawyer who worked with the Trump Organization, the company will not make foreign deals but will pursue domestic ones.\nWhen he will nominate a new Supreme Court justice \nTrump said he will nominate a justice to the Supreme Court within two weeks of his inauguration. The empty seat has been left vacant since Justice Antonin Scalia died in February.\nAn update on the status of Trump’s planned border wall with Mexico \nTrump wants to get to work on building the border wall with Mexico that he repeatedly promised during his campaign. He said Mexico will reimburse the U.S. for the wall. “I want to get the wall started,” he said. “I don’t want wait a year and half to make a deal with Mexico.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T20:34:16.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
