Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nWhen it comes to buying apps, iPhone users aren’t afraid to bust out their wallets for good software. \nSpending on iOS apps increased during 2016, according to the latest data from app analytics firm SensorTower which claims the average iPhone user spends $27 a year just on games. \niPhone owners spent about $40 on apps in total in 2016. That figure is up from $35 spent per user last year. Games took more than 80 percent of U.S. App Store revenue in 2016. Meanwhile music, entertainment and social networking apps were the next three most popular categories users spent money on. All the money is in games. Photo: SensorTower \nWhile the amount of cash games are able to rake in is impressive, one of the biggest standouts in SensorTower’s findings was that spending on entertainment apps shot up 130%. The rise thanks to the likes of HBO Now, Hulu and Netflix that allow users to subscribe through the App Store. \nDespite the increase in spending, iPhone owners are actually downloading fewer apps per year. The study found that the number of app downloads per device dropped from 35 in 2015 to 33 in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:06:13.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
