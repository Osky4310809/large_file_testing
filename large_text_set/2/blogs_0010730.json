(And of course, to the long-running All That sketch that inspired it.) \nCause there’s a bun in her oven. Burgers have buns, unless you’re cutting back on carbs. Get it?\nMitchell, who is now 38 years old and has been married to Asia Lee since 2012, very appropriately announced the couple’s big news on Valentine’s Day morning, and judging by the hundreds of comments left of the post within the span of a single hour, fans are feeling the love for “Ed,” his gorgeous bride, and their first child together.\n“We have a bun in the oven! ” Mitchell captioned the pic. “thank you @therealasialee for being the best Wife to me the best Friend to me and now the best Mom to our blessed baby!! I love you so much! #thankyouJesus #Blessed #specialdelivery #myWiferocks❤️ photo credit: @ohmyjosephine”\nWe have a bun in the oven! thank you @therealasialee for being the best Wife to me the best Friend to me and now the best Mom to our blessed baby!!

The commitment to detail is admirable.\nMitchell, who currently stars on Nickelodeon’s Game Shakers as the billionaire Double G, has been feeling the ’90s love a lot lately. The recent nostalgia boom for the golden decade gave the actor a chance to reprise his Ed character on The Tonight Show in 2015, and he joined his All That cast for mini-reunions on The Splat in 2016 and at New York Comic Con the year before. \nAdd his 2016 Double Dare stint with Josh Server , Lori Beth Denberg, and Danny “Little Pete” Tamberelli, and it’s easy to forget that the ’90s ever left.\nSquaaaa #AllThat #LoriBeth #JoshServer #dannytamberelli #SanDiegoComicCon All That Reunion \nA post shared by Kel Mitchell (@iamkelmitchell) on Jul 22, 2016 at 5:51pm PDT \n…But they did. Kel is 38 with his third baby on the way, Kenan Thompson has a two-year-old that will presumably be Kel’s kid’s best friend, and children these days play with smartphones at age seven instead of Gak. \nSo basically, we appreciate the throwback to the halcyon days, Kel. And wish you and Lee a joyful pregnancy and life with your baby.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:25:03.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
