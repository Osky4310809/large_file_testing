Both co-hosts found common ground about Trump tweeting a reply to Streep the day after the speech, calling her “one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood.” \nTrump also tweeted that Streep “doesn’t know me but attacked me last night at the Golden Globes.” He called her a “Hillary flunky who lost big.” \nBehar called Trump “a baby” for responding to seemingly every public figure who criticizes him, adding “he’s not there to ‘tit for tat’ for every slight that goes through his thick skin.” \nBila agreed. \n“It’s not his place to respond,” she said. “Donald Trump should be focused on how to fix the country.” What do you think?
