The opening three-part Flyroam release comes in three differing yet instantly wearables styles: a hi-top chukka, a Chelsea boot, or a four-eyelet Oxford. The result is a shoe that looks just as good paired with luxe sportswear as it does with denim or sharp tailored trousers.\nAlongside the new overall design, the Flyroam debuts Timberland’s groundbreaking (no pun intended) AeroCore energy sole unit system. With reduced weight and flexibility placed front and center, AeroCore is constructed from high-rebound PU foam while rubber features sparingly on the outer sole making the shoe light and reactive.\nA performance shoe designed for those who care about sport and fashion, but want something that can stand up to the urban environment, Timberland’s Flyroam is a solid addition to the burgeoning sneakerboot class.\nFor more info on the Flyroam collection, check out Timberland’s online store .\nMore Info ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:52:02.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
