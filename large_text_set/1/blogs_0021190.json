We’re also highlighting the regional cover athletes for Canada and Taiwan, we’re outlining what you get by making the jump to our Season Starter Packs, and — last but certainly not least — we’re revealing the Twitch livestream schedule leading up to launch.\n\nRetro mode is pretty much a one-button mode, but with surprising depth, and all the new animations, gameplay additions, and improvements found in the regular version of the game.\nFor example, in an effort to simplify the batter vs. pitcher battle, we’ve taken all the pitching attributes out and boiled them down to velocity, break, and control. Because there is no high and low in the strike zone, you have three pitches at your disposal that you can trigger with the touch of one button. To throw a fastball you hold down on the left analog stick and press X. To throw a changeup you hold up on the left analog stick and press X. And to throw a slider you press to the left or right on the left analog stick after the pitch is released.\nOne of the wrinkles we’ve added is that velocity is controlled by holding down or up on the analog stick just before the pitcher releases. In closing, you choose velocity before the pitch is thrown and you can affect movement (left or right) after the pitch is thrown.\nMLB The Show 17 Regional Covers For our friends in Canada, we’re excited to finally reveal the regional cover athlete for this year’s game.\n\n2016 American League All-Star Aaron Sanchez graces the Canadian cover this year. Aaron was a key part in the Blue Jays returning to the post season for the second straight year.\n\nMiami Marlins starting pitcher Wei-Yin Chen once again graces the Taiwan cover of MLB The Show.\nWhen you pre-order MLB The Show 17, you will receive 10 bonus Standard Packs and a Ken Griffey Jr. Card for The Show 17 when you pick-up or download the game.
