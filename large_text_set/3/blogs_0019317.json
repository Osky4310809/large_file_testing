Hide Caption (CNN) Samuel Staples, a fresh-faced 20-year-old from London's Guildhall School of Music & Drama, appears nonchalant. His black leather jacket is off and he's raring to go. His excitement is palpable. He's been playing the violin since he was five, but this is the first time anyone has let him loose on a Stradivarius for a day and \"every violinist,\" he says, \"dreams of playing a Strad.\" Rare emeralds discovered in 400-year-old shipwreck set to fetch millions For the last 300 years or so, there's been a persistent mystique about the great Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari and his violins. In a long life, he produced about 1,100 stringed instruments -- violins, violas, guitars and cellos. About 550 violins (out of an estimated 960) are still with us today. These days, the finest Strads can sell privately for more than $15 million, usually to banks, charities and music patrons, and are loaned out to leading violinists.

A pinch mark the size and color of a peach is visible under his chin, where the violin rest has wedged into his skin. He's oblivious to it. He speaks like a driver who's just been promoted to Formula One. The Strad is \"very easy to handle, very immediate like a racing car. You can make more sound with less pressure.\" On March 28, the instrument Staples is playing -- the 1684 \"Ex-Croall; McEwen\" violin, named after former owners -- will be up for auction at Sotheby's in London. And with a sale estimate of $1.5-2.5 million, it's a relative bargain.
