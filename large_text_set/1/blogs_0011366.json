The younger sister ended up testifying against Matt,” she told Dr Phil. “I do not believe he ever sexually abused anyone.” \nBut Sara's parents, Anne and Dovelle, are terrified that their granddaughter will become a victim and have threatened to seek custody if Sara doesn't dump her boyfriend. \n“When I told my parents that Matt was a registered sex offender, they were very angry,” she explained. \nOf her parents trying to seek custody of her daughter, Sara said that she feels “betrayed”. Sara was confronted by her mother Anne on the Dr Phil Show over her new boyfriend Matt (Photo: drphil.com) \n“I really wish they would back off when it comes to my relationships and how I raise my daughter,” she said. \n“I could never imagine Matt groping or harming my child and if I did that, he would never be around her. Matt and I are considering moving in together,” she said. \nSara's mother Anne claimed her daughter was being “reckless”, and said: “I am terrified of my granddaughter being around him.” \nAnne said that after he was convicted by a judge that's game over: “Once you're a paedophile, you're always a paedophile.” Matt has to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life (Photo: drphil.com) \nWhile her father Dovell said: “I am very protective of my granddaughter. If I ever found out that Matt hurt my granddaughter, I would drive to his house, kick his door in – and there would be no saving him.” \nHe also added that Sara has to break up with Matt: “And if she doesn’t, I will see her in court for custody of my granddaughter.” \nMatt, who has two ex-wives and three children, insists that he's innocent of charges that he groped a minor six years ago. \nHe said: “I absolutely did not molest my ex-wife’s sister.” Matt's reaction to his victim's phone call (Photo: drphil.com) \nAnne says she’s furious that Sara is considering moving in with Matt. “If she moves in with him without him being cleared of these charges, I will file for custody of that child.” \n“If I’m wrong then it will be completely over… completely,” Sara said. \nDr Phil said that the main concern is for the two-year-old daughter. \n“This has nothing to do with whether he’s guilty or not,” Dr Phil said. “If you are a single mother cohabitating with a male, the risk of a child being sexually abused is 20 times normal – that doesn’t necessarily mean by the male you’re living with.” \nDuring the show, Matt was confronted by his victim, who was his former wife’s (then) 14-year-old sister, who said that she was willing to take a polygraph to prove she was telling the truth.
