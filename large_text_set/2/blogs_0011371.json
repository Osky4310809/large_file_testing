Flynn gave Rapunzel the lighted lantern as a symbol of his love for her. Cutie pies Gus Gus and Jacque showed their affection for Cinderella by helping her to escape from the attic. Finally, who better to represent warm fondness than our favorite, Mickey Mouse – he hasn’t found a pal he didn’t love!\nOur Brittany Ungvarsky has created an amazing do-it-yourself Valentine’s display featuring the favorites we just listed. You’ll be able to showcase cards and photos as examples of your own love! \nYou can find the Valentine’s display template here and the instructions to assemble the display here !\nXoxo\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:10:25.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
