Although she grew up on a farm in the countryside, her childhood was still overshadowed by World War I, which began in 1914. As Dominique Rowe recently explored in an in-depth TIME.com profile of Hollingworth and her work, Hollingworth decided from a young age that she wanted to be a writer, but first spent time in Poland, arranging the evacuation of more than 3,500 political and Jewish refugees to Britain in the lead up to World War II.\n\nWhen she left Poland in 1939, her expertise in that country proved to be essential to what would be the defining moment of her career, as Rowe reported:\nWithin a month of returning to England, she had secured a job as a war correspondent for the Telegraph , and almost immediately returned back to the Polish-German border in Katowice, where she stayed with a diplomat friend from the Foreign Office.\nKnowing that war may be imminent, and bolstered by the presence of a diplomatic flag, she borrowed her host’s car, and “motored off alone into Nazi Germany” to stock up on wine and aspirin. As she drove back along the border, a fabric partition separating the two countries flapped momentarily in the wind, exposing “scores, if not hundreds of tanks” in the valley below. And there was her first big scoop: the outbreak of World War II.\nThree days later, at 5 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939, Hollingworth was awoken by the sound of tanks rolling past her window. She scrambled to call her editor, as well as the British and Polish Foreign Offices, each of whom met her news with disbelief. (At this point Poland thought it was still in negotiations with Germany.)\nHollingworth’s important role in her profession continued long after that groundbreaking scoop. As well as writing five books, Hollingworth covered conflicts in Europe, North Africa and Asia for the Telegraph and the Guardian . (And, when a ban was imposed on British female correspondents on the front lines in Egypt in 1942, she approached the American press instead and became accredited by TIME .)\nRead more: The Correspondent Who Scooped the World \nHollingworth married her second husband, Geoffrey Hoare, the London Times ‘ Middle East correspondent, in 1951.

Until her death, Hollingworth lived in Hong Kong, in an apartment near the Foreign Correspondents’ Club (FCC). Despite the onset of macular degeneration in 1995, Rowe reported, “she never officially retired and ‘ Clare’s Table’ at the FCC was reserved for her every single day, in case she turned up for lunch or dinner.”\nT ara Joseph, president of the FCC, said in a statement that the organization was “very sad” to hear about Hollingworth’s passing. “She was a tremendous inspiration to us all,” Joseph said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T18:42:09.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
