However, ii seems that Raees is already on a lead, going by the advance booking numbers. \nThat's right, the SRK-Mahira Khan starrer has garnered around Rs 12.50 crore nett in advance booking sales while Kaabil is struggling with a Rs 3 crore nett. Trade experts mention that the numbers of Kaabil are even lower than that of a Dishoom. Apparently, Kaabil did open a litle late for advance bookings. However, as per analysts a superstar like Hrithik Roshan should have ideally drawn in more numbers. \nThe advance bookings for Dangal, Sultan and PRDP were 16.5 cr, 21 cr, and 15 cr respectively. However, these were Christmas, Eid and Diwali releases. A good run for Raees and a risky run for Kaabil can apparently thus be predicted given that a good opening was Kaabil's best bet. \nHowever, let us wait and watch how things churn out in the coming days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T03:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:44:05.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
