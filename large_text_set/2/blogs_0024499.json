No one was shot during the incident, which resulted in the arrest of the 13-year-old and another teen, but not the unnamed officer. \nYou can watch the video above. A single shot is fired about the 2:30 mark of the video. \nThe names of the teens have also not been released, KTLA-TV reports. Police told the news station the incident occurred near the officer’s home in Anaheim on Tuesday about 2:40 p.m. His home is located near Loara High School, Anaheim Police said, and several teens can be seen in the video with backpacks, apparently after leaving the school. \n“The confrontation began over ongoing issues with juveniles walking across the officer’s property,” Anaheim Police said in a statement. The investigation into the incident is ongoing and police said the officer admitted to firing the gun. He was not charged, but the 13-year-old boy seen being grabbed by the officer and another 15-year-old boy were arrested. \nThe 13-year-old is facing charges of criminal threats and battery, the Orange County Register reports. The 15-year-old was charged with assault and battery, according to the newspaper. (Youtube screenshot) \n“We are aware of numerous videos being posted on YouTube and other internet sites. We cannot authenticate the validity of these videos as they were not recorded or posted by APD. However, they do appear to depict portions of the incident in question,” Anaheim Police said in a statement. \nThe Los Angeles Police Department said it is also conducting a “concurrent/administrative investigation.” \nAccording to the Los Angeles Times , the case will be investigated by the Anaheim Police homicide division and the results will be forwarded to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office. (Youtube screenshot) \nThe mother of the 13-year-old boy who was arrested told KTLA she planned to visit with her son Wednesday at the detention facility where he is being held, and will then speak to the media about the incident. \nPolice say the boy threatened to shoot the off-duty officer, but his parents dispute that. \nHis father told KTLA the officer was angry about a girl who cut across his lawn, and the boy came to her defense, starting the confrontation. He says he did not threaten to harm the officer, and was trying to break free from his grasp. \nThe boy also says in the video, “He tried to hit me in my nuts. That’s like a little pu**y move, punch a kid in the nuts.” \nIn the video, the officer tells the boy that he is holding him because he has been resisting him. \n“No, I wasn’t. You tackled me first. I didn’t do anything to hurt you,” the teen tells the officer. “All I said was, ‘Respect the girl,’ because you said, ‘Get out of my property.’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:45:24.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
