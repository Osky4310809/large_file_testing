However, an exclusive video of him in action would show his claim that he’s comparably as fast as Pacquiao is somewhat exaggerated. \nThe former school teacher from Brisbane also tends to leave his head uncovered, over-exposed when digging in for the kill. \nSaid Fight Saga: “Horn is more flatfooted than Algieri. He moves well, but don’t expect him to play ‘hide and seek’ with Manny.” \nJeff Horn: “I don’t want to say I’m to stop Pacquiao. But yes, I do think I will win. I’m very confident of that.” Horn has vowed to stand his ground. \nTrainer Freddie Roach: Great, the better, sweeter if [he] doesn’t run and hide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:43:54.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
