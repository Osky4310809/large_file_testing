Add the leeks and sweat, stirring occasionally, until softened but not yet browned, about 5 minutes. Add the butternut squash, nutmeg, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 5 minutes. Add the sherry to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until reduced slightly, then add enough stock to just cover the vegetables. If 3 cups isn't sufficient, make up the difference with water. Turn the heat up to high and bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat to keep it at a bare simmer, and simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes, or until the squash is fork-tender. Add the milk and 2 tablespoons cream and blend until smooth, either using an immersion blender or by carefully transferring to a blender in batches. Season to taste with salt, pepper, sherry, and sherry vinegar. Ladle into bowls and drizzle with cream.
