Leicester vs Man Utd Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \nIn the past, United have signed Robin van Persie from Arsenal, Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham and Andy Cole from Newcastle, but they have not bought a player from a top-four rival since signing Juan Mata in January 2014 when he was no longer in Mourinho's plans at Chelsea. \n\"Football has changed in the three years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. This is the new football,\" Mourinho said. \n\"Do you think I can go to Tottenham and buy two players to kill Tottenham? I can't. I cannot go to Arsenal and buy their two best players, or go to Chelsea and bring two of the players that I love very, very much. That time is over. Zlatan Ibrahimovic signed from Paris Saint-Germain when his contract expired last summer \n\"The situation where you could start to become the champions by attacking your opponents is over in this country. If you get a player from a top club, you only get a player those clubs don't want to keep. \n\"You cannot attack your rivals any more. It used to be that when one of the big clubs was getting stronger, another of the big clubs was getting weaker. Harry Kane has reportedly been of interest to Manchester United but Mourinho does not think he could raid Tottenham for their best players \n\"The problem we are finding is that we are getting stronger but so are the others - they are getting powerful. That means we have to grow up again and it is going to take more time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:01:03.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
