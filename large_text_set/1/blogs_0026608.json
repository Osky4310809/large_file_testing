By Anonymous Biologic drugs \nCrohn’s disease causes inflammation, swelling, and irritation in the lining of the digestive tract. \nIf you have tried other treatments for Crohn’s disease and they haven’t worked, you might consider biologic drugs. Biologics are prescription drugs that help reduce harmful inflammation from Crohn’s disease. \nKeep reading to find out if biologics are right for you. What are biologic therapies? \nBiologics are genetically engineered medicines that target certain molecules in the body involved in causing inflammation. \nDoctors often prescribe biologics to those with refractory Crohn’s disease or moderate to severe symptoms that aren’t going away with other medications. Before biologics, there were few nonsurgical treatment options for people with refractory disease. \nBiologic therapies work to quickly bring on remission. During a period of remission, inflammation and intestinal symptoms go away. Biologics may also be used on a long-term basis to help maintain periods of remission. Types of biologics \nThe type of biologic your doctor suggests will depend on the severity of your symptoms and the location of disease. \nEveryone is different. A certain biological drug may work better for some than others. You may have to try a few medications before finding what works for you. \nBiological therapies for Crohn’s disease fall into one of two categories: anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies and anti-integrin antibodies. \nAnti-TNF therapies target a protein that’s involved in inflammation. For Crohn’s disease, anti-TNF therapies work by blocking inflammation caused by this protein in the intestines. Anti-integrins block certain immune system cells that cause inflammation. \nBiologics are typically given either subcutaneously (with a needle through the skin) or intravenously (through an IV tube). They may be given every two to eight weeks, depending on the medication. You’ll have to go to a hospital or clinic for most of these treatments. \nThe FDA has approved several biological drugs to treat Crohn’s disease. \nAnti-TNF medications include:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:41:33.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
