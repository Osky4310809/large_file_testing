In this way, we can strengthen relations going forward by learning from the experience of the past four and a half decades.\" \nSpeaking about President Xi's announcement at the World Economic Forum in Davos that China will host the Belt and Road Forum, Liu said he hopes \"in the New Year China and the UK will seize the new opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative and maintain high-level exchanges\". \nIn addition, Liu would like to see solid steps taken in practical bilateral cooperation, covering many areas, including trade, investment, finance, energy, infrastructure, scientific innovation, education and culture. \nZhang Yonghao in London contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T14:49:43.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
