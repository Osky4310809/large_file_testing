But photographers’ dreams are strikingly different: they are only one shot away from becoming a reality. Each breathtaking photo started as a bold fantasy in an artist’s brilliant mind – be it a volcano crater, a humpback whale, or a bearer of a nearly lost culture. \nBut the truth is, most of us are bound to reality’s constraints. Budget, resources, lack of equipment and free time make it nearly impossible to actually give life to your dream photograph. This is where Wix comes in: we want to take the load of restrictions off your shoulders, to make room for your camera backpack and the adventure of a lifetime. The sky is no longer the limit \n“Make your life a dream, and your dream a reality,” said Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The first part of the quote is on you, and for the next two weeks – the second part is on us: \nIn the Capture Your Dream Photo contest launching today, we invite photographers from all over the world to submit their most daring ideas for a chance to make their dream photo shoot a reality.
