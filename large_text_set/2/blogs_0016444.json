He later said it was “a bit of fun”. \nJournalists report that the 46-year-old Shaw ate the pie while standing by the substitutes’ bench. He later said in an interview that the pie was in fact a pasty and he ate it as he was “light-headed’’. \n“We are told we are not allowed to gamble as it is full-time professional football,’’ he added. \n“In no way did I put anyone in jeopardy of that — this is not the case here. This is just a bit of fun and me being hungry.’’ \nAsked whether he knew if anyone had taken up the bet, he said: “I think there were a few people. I think a few mates and a few of the fans.’’ \nThe Gambling Commission, which licenses and regulates gambling in Britain, says it is looking into whether there was any irregularity in the betting market. \nIt said it was also trying to establish whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity. \nThe commission had warned operators in June last year about the integrity of taking bets on novelty markets. \n“Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened,” said enforcement and intelligence director Richard Watson. \nSun Bets, who sponsored the club on Monday for the fifth-round tie, said in a tweet that it had paid out a “five-figure sum’’ on the bet. \nSutton manager Paul Doswell said after the game: “I don’t think it shows us in the best light.’’ \nClub chairman Bruce Elliott, in his reaction, said: “I didn’t know anything about it. \n“He has got himself in the papers again and the fame obviously has gone to his head a little bit, but we will soon bring him back down to earth, don’t worry about that.’’ Shaw said he was told about the betting promotion before the game. \n“I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let’s do it,’’ he added. “All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down. \n“It was just a bit of banter for them. It is something to make the occasion as well and you can look back and say it was part of it and we got our ticket money back.’’ \nA worldwide ban on betting in football was introduced in 2014 and covers everyone involved in the game, from the players and managers to the match officials and club staff. \nIt prevents participants covered by the ban from betting, either directly or indirectly, on any football match or competition, including the passing of “inside information’’. \nThe FA website defines that as “information that you are aware of due to your position in the game and which is not publicly available’’. \nIt adds: “You are not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.’’ Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:20:18.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
