We all know that. The actress spends most of her time on flights shuttling between India and the U.S., and even her days off are not really her days off as she’s always reading scripts or prepping for something in the pipeline, as she has confessed to before. I still don’t understand how she does it, but I’ll leave this for another conversation. \nNaturally, PC was in dire need of a weekend getaway and that’s exactly what she did. She headed to the beach with her friends and shared some gorgeous photos.
