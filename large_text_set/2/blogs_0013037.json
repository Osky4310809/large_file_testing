File photo \n  Companies affected by the environment department’s cancellation of mining projects would be given due process and are free to turn to the courts for legal remedies, Malacañang said yesterday. \nPresidential spokesman Ernesto Abella gave the assurance to companies which have been targets of Environment Secretary Regina Lopez’s crackdown on mining operations in watersheds. \nOn Tuesday, Lopez announced the cancellation of 75 mining contracts or mineral production sharing agreements (MPSA) for posing threats to watersheds and to overall water supply. \n“The cancellation of 75 mineral production sharing agreements by Secretary Regina Lopez is consistent with Republic Act 7942 that mining applications are closed to proclaimed watershed forest reserves,” Abella said in a statement. \n“However, as agreed upon in the last Cabinet meeting, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is to establish that it has gone through due process before enforcing the applicable laws, rules or regulations,” he added. \nAbella said the DENR is set to issue a show cause order to concerned mining firms, which would be given seven days to reply.   \nChief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo said mining firms may appeal the DENR’s decision before the Office of the President. \n“The mining companies have been given due process by the DENR, otherwise I don’t think it will arbitrarily close any mining company,” Panelo said. \n“They have remedies under the law. They can file a motion for reconsideration and then if they have not clarified their position on their motion for reconsideration, they can (appeal to) the Office of the President,” he added. \nThe cancelled MPSAs – representing almost a third of the country’s contracts for undeveloped mines – are still in the exploration stage and have yet to reach the production phase. \nIn Pangasinan, Sen. Cynthia Villar said due process should be observed in any move to penalize mining firms. \n“I think the only concern of the government is for her to follow the law in closing these mines, as there is due process,” the senator said. \nIn justifying her decision, Lopez said the government places more importance on the lives of the people than on investors’ money. \nThe cancellation of 75 MPSAs came more than a week after the DENR ordered the closure of 23 metallic mines and the suspension of five others for serious violations of environmental laws. \nThe orders were based on the final results of an audit that assessed mining operators’ compliance with existing regulations. 1.2-M people affected \nThe Chamber of Mines of the Philippines, a group of companies involved in exploration, mining, mineral processing and services industries, said the orders would affect 1.2 million people. \nThe DENR orders would cost affected local governments in 10 provinces over P650 million yearly in foregone revenues based on estimates by the finance department. The provinces to be affected by the orders are Benguet, Nueva Vizcaya, Palawan, Cebu, Bulacan, Zambales, Eastern Samar, Dinagat Islands, Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur. \nThe Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) said the DENR decision is expected to take a heavy toll on the country’s trade and investment image, as it appealed to President Duterte to step into the matter. \nThe PCCI said Lopez issued the cancellation orders despite her being a signatory to a resolution by the Mining Industry Coordinating Council (MICC). \n“Due process and multi-stakeholder reviews were guaranteed by DENR Secretary Lopez herself and other MICC members just days before the new cancellations orders,” PCCI president George Barcelon said. \n“She herself signed the MICC resolution and now it is not followed,” the business leader added. \n“How can a company risk stockholders’ money in projects if the investment rules are unclear and uncertain,” he said. \n“We hope the President could consider moving on this issue of due process quickly because investors could put on hold their investments decisions,” he added. \nBarcelon said the resolution of the MICC, which Lopez co-chairs with Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, was clear about the need for the conduct of multi-stakeholder review of the results of DENR audit on firms’ compliance with mining rules and regulations. \nHe said members of the climate change adaptation and mitigation and economic development clusters of the Cabinet also signed the MICC resolution. \nGlobal Ferronickel Holdings (FNI), a COMP member, said taxpayers would suffer from the backlash of Lopez’s order. \nIt said the development might cost the government “several billion dollars” since contractors are entitled to investment guarantees. \n“Under the law, there is an investment guarantee so this amounts either to an expropriation, with the canceling and all that, or say requisition investment,” FNI president Dante Bravo told reporters at a weekly forum yesterday. \n“At the end of the day, Congress will have to pass a law to pay for this damage or for the return of investment for all the mining companies affected and eventually it will be collected through taxes. It’s going to be the Filipino people who will shoulder it,” he added. \n“The government operates with a budget, funded with the collection of taxes and some government revenues. If you have this additional obligation, it will likely be passed [on to taxpayers],” he explained. – With Louise Maureen Simeon, Richmond Mercurio, Cesar Ramirez  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:13:58.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
