This is very real news, and we now have confirmation from Bieber himself he actually did pee his pants. It wasn’t just a coincidence his crotch region was soaked. \nIt is, in fact, urine, folks. Giphy \nThe 22-year-old star took to Instagram following the news to confirm he did actually pee his sweatpants by sharing a hilarious meme, which reads, “You ain’t cool… unless you pee your pants.” \nWho knew JB would be such a good sport about something so damn embarrassing? The maturing of the Biebs is no longer a myth. Giphy \nThe hilarious split-image meme shows Justin Bieber sporting a pair of $400 piss-soaked Vetements sweatpants alongside a still from the 1995 film “Billy Madison” starring Adam Sandler .

I mean, there are just so many fucking questions. Like, why exactly did this guy pee his pants? How was he able to say so calm and even talk on the phone the entire time? \nWhy would he immediately go and purchase a smoothie after peeing his pants? Was there not a restroom in the establishment in which he bought the smoothie?! \nThe questions are endless. Giphy \nOverall, I think there is an important lesson to be learned here… \nNo matter how bizarrely expensive your sweatpants are and no matter how insanely rich you are, these “golden” tragedies can happen to anyone — even someone with eight bathrooms nestled in the Hollywood Hills.
