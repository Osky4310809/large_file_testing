We wish her well.\" \nThat kicked off a war of words between Camila and the group - she insisted they’d known for a while she wanted to leave, while the band suggested that wasn’t the case. (L-R) Singers Dinah Jane, Lauren Jauregui, Normani Kordei, and Ally Brooke of Fifth Harmony on stage (Photo: WireImage) \nCamila said she was “shocked” by Fifth Harmony’s statement , telling fans: “The girls were aware of my feelings through the long, much needed conversations about the future that we had during our tour. Saying that they were just informed through my representatives that I was ‘leaving the group’ is simply not true.” \n\"Just like the other girls said in their statement about their plans, I had also planned to continue with my own solo endeavours in the New Year, but I did not intend to end things with Fifth Harmony this way,” she added.

Reid and the label to step in and try to set meetings, which again, she refused. We even went as far as group counseling which she did not show up to. So no, after months of rejection from her and her team, these supposed lengthy conversations in fact never happened, although we pleased. \n\"We have tried with exhausted efforts and hearts to keep this group alive as the five of us, and we want it to be very clear that unfortunately those efforts were not mutual.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T07:38:41.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
