Nicolas Mirguet/Flickr/CC/by-nc/2.0/. 2. National Gallery of Modern Art \nIf you're an art lover, don't miss visiting the National Gallery of Modern Art on Palace Road. This gallery, which opened in 2009, is the third such one in India (the others are in Delhi and Mumbai). It's housed in a Colonial mansion with a garden setting, and has two interconnected wings. The old wing features works from the early 18th century up until India's Independence, while the new one displays works from a large number of modern and contemporary artists. There's a cafe on the premises as well. The gallery is open daily except Monday, from 10 a.m until 5 p.m. The entry fee for Indians is 20 rupees and 500 rupees for foreigners. (Note: unfortunately this fee was recently substantially increased and many foreigners feel that 500 rupees is way too much to pay). Photography is not allowed. More » Bangalore Tipu Sultan's Palace.

The palace is open daily from 8.30 a.m. until 5.30 p.m. Tickets cost 15 rupees for Indians and 200 rupees for foreigners. Combine visiting it with nearby Krishna Rajendra Market.
