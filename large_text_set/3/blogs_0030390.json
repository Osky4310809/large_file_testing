This triggers more upheaval when the imaginary friend she created as a child, Mary, suddenly reappears as she is nervous to meet Ben's kids for the first time, on the special preview of \"Imaginary Mary.\" (Photo: Katie Yu, ABC) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSome TV ideas are best left to the imagination. \nWell, let's be fair. It's theoretically possible that someone out there has an idea for a great TV sitcom built around an adult woman who is suddenly accosted by her childhood imaginary friend. But that great (or even good) show is not ABC’s Imaginary Mary (preview Wednesday, 8:30 ET/PT, then Tuesdays, 9:30, * ½ out of four) — another terrible “high concept” sitcom on a network that seems to be almost fatally attracted to them. \nPerhaps ABC’s Disney overlords were blinded by the opportunity to sell Mary dolls in their retail outlets — or perhaps the network just wanted to thank Mary creators Adam F. Goldberg and David Guarascio (teamed here with big-screen animator Patrick Osborne) for giving the network The Goldbergs . (Though that would hardly seem to be a big-enough hit to justify this big a second swing.) Or perhaps ABC has just temporarily taken leave of its senses, as it has before with such shows as Work It, The Neighbors and Cavemen . \nPut aside for just a moment the creepy stuffed animal/talking throw pillow that gives the show its name, one that only Jenna Elfman’s Alice can see and hear. Instead, let’s start by looking at the problems with Mary that would sink even a more conventional sitcom, beginning with a flat script that seems to completely misjudge Elfman’s appeal. \nIMAGINARY MARY - ABC's ÒImaginary Mary\" stars Mary. (ABC) (Photo: ABC) \nFor those who don’t remember, Elfman became a star on ABC’s 1997-2002 sitcom Dharma & Greg playing a fun, free spirit who brightened the life of her more staid husband. No one is saying she has to play that role forever — but casting her as a tightly wound, kid-adverse executive with no social skills or sense is asking a lot of her, particularly when you’re basically relying on her appeal alone to fill out a bland, selfish character. \nSo it should come as no great surprise that there’s no chemistry at all between Alice and Stephen Schneider’s Ben, the divorced father of three for whom Alice falls. There's no reason any father would let this woman near his kids — and no reason why this woman would want to get involved with children who appear to have been raised with no parental guidance. Not to mention that, like so many TV families, they barely appear to be aware of each other, let alone related to each other. \nWhich brings us to Mary (voiced by Rachel Dratch), who reappears in Alice’s life to give her comfort, reassurance and advice, as she did when Alice was a child. Some of the advice is good, and some of it is bad, depending on what the story requires at that moment. But none of it is funny — which at least is in keeping with the rest of the show. \nYes, it's a fantasy, but it's an oddly off-putting one. This woman, after all, is conversing with a plush toy. She either needs psychiatric help or an armed intervention, because the chances of Mary going all stabby homicidal like that crazy ABC Trilogy of Terror voodoo doll seem fairly high. \nThough that could just be my imagination. 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:12:51.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
