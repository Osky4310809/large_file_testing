AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File \nDAVAO CITY, Philippines – Suspected New People’s Army (NPA) rebels repeatedly fired at a convoy extending relief assistance to earthquake victims in Surigao del Norte late Tuesday night, the military said yesterday. \nBranding the attack as “an act of treachery” amid a temporary ceasefire in Surigao, the military said unidentified men strafed last Tuesday night a convoy vehicle carrying members of the 30th Infantry Battalion and volunteers from the ABS-CBN Foundation, in Barangay Linunggaman, San Francisco town. \nThe aid convoy was on its way back to Surigao City, the province’s capital, from distributing aid in quake-ravaged Malimono town. \nCapt. Joe Patrick Martinez, spokesman of the Army’s 4th Infantry Division, said his group received a report that the NPA’s Militia ng Bayan was responsible for carrying out the attack, based on the admission of a certain Ka Lukas of Sangay ng Partido Pampropaganda in a dialogue with residents of Barangay Mat-I in Surigao City. \nBut TV station ABS-CBN reported yesterday the NPA denies committing the attack. \nThe ABS-CBN report said NPA Guerilla Front 16 spokeman Ka Oto claimed rebel leaders had asked their members about the incident, and none took responsibility for the attack on the convoy of the 30th IB platoon in Surigao del Norte.   \nKa Oto said the Army itself might have orchestrated the attack to discredit the rebels’ unilateral ceasefire. \nBut the military said they have no reason to sabotage their own relief operations. \nNo casualty was reported in the incident. \nThe NPA had declared a unilateral ceasefire in Surigao last weekend to allow the peaceful transport of goods to earthquake victims. \n“We condemn in the strongest terms the action of the NPAs that despite their declaration of ceasefire, they ambushed an aid convoy that delivered relief goods to the victims of the earthquake in Surigao,” a statement of the Armed Forces Eastern Mindanao Command (Eastmincom) read. \nMajor Gen. Benjamin Madrigal Jr., commander of the Army’s 4th Infantry Division, called the NPA’s ceasefire declaration in Surigao as “nothing but lie and deception.” \nThe Eastmincom said the NPA atrocity has added to the suffering and misery of the people, who are trying to recover from the devastation brought by the earthquake. \n“We call on everyone at this time to show compassion and help in aiding the victims of this tragic event instead of promoting violence,” the statement further read, adding it would continue helping the local governments and the local disaster management authorities bring normalcy in the quake-affected areas. \nMalacañang cautioned the NPA yesterday against attacking government forces, saying last Tuesday night’s shooting of the aid convoy for Surigao quake victims “was a clear violation of the armed group’s ceasefire declaration.” \n“The government, through the Armed Forces and other agencies, will continue in its humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, and it would even serve the purpose of the NPA if they engage more in confidence-building activities, rather than that which confirm their terrorist status, to which PRRD (Duterte) has relegated them,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella warned in a statement. NPA denies Agusan attack \nThe NPA also denied firing at military elements in the mountains of Sarog, Barangay San Isidro, Santiago, Agusan del Norte last Feb. 11. \nIn a statement dated Feb. 14, Ka Oto also refused to own up to the alleged encounter, where a soldier and two civilians were reportedly killed and two others wounded. \n“There was no encounter between the New People’s Army and the 29th IBPA troops of the AFP because no member of the NPA in North Eastern Mindanao Region was in Sarog during that time,” Oto said. \nThe NPA said the armed men were paramilitaries, who are assets of the 29th IBPA and PNP, and plotted with them in ransacking mine tunnels of high-grade gold. \nAccording to the rebels’ own investigation, the armed men, with their faces covered and who were with the 29th IB and SAF-PNP troops conducting joint operations in the area, fired at the small miners in the mountains of Sarog, despite the latter’s plea to spare them, civilians. Other supposed NPA attacks \nIn Sarangani, the police and military said the eight communist rebel caught early this week in Alabel town were out to burn buses and equipment of construction companies to avenge losses in recent encounters with the military. \nSenior members of the Alabel municipal peace and order council said the police would charge the eight NPA members with illegal possession of firearms and explosives. \nThe arson attacks, police and Army intelligence sources said yesterday, were meant to pressure owners of bus and construction firms to give them protection money regularly. \nIn Zamboanga del Norte, heavily armed NPA guerillas raided and torched a military detachment in Sergio Osmeña town last Valentines’ Day, local police said yesterday. \nPolice Supt. Rogelio Alabata, Police Regional Office 9 spokesman, said an undetermined number of NPA rebels swooped down on Barangay Bagumbayan. \nAlabata said the rebels later torched the detachment of the Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) at about 10 a.m., after the militia men on duty had retreated, as they sensed they were outnumbered. \nAlabata said no casualty was reported during the incident. Human rights violations \nIn Ilocos Sur, the Ilocos Human Rights Alliance said the military’s “declared focused military operation” in the area against communist rebels would only result in more human rights violations. \nIn Bacolod City, the National Democratic Front in Negros province warned of a worsening case of extrajudicial killings in the country, with the inclusion of “progressive organizations” in the target list of military “harassments and trumped up charges.” \nPriest-turned-rebel Frank Fernandez warned in a statement to local media yesterday “the revolutionary forces in Negros are prepared to do battle against the AFP and the PNP and win,” with the lifting of a unilateral ceasfire. \nIn the Kapihan sa Manila Bay yesterday, presidential adviser on the peace process Jesus Dureza said only President Duterte could tell when terminated peace talks between the government and the Reds would restart. – With Michael Punungbayan, Christina Mendez, Gerry Lee Gorit, Ben Serrano, John Unson, Roel Pareno, Artemio Dumlao, Gibert Bayoran and Jose Rodel Clapano  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:45:54.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
