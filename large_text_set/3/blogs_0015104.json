Buffalo Bills \nCorey Davis , WR, Western Michigan Broncos : We had Washington Huskies speedster John Ross here last week, but Davis is the more complete receiver. With Sammy Watkins still dealing with his foot issues, zeroing in on someone that combines size and speed makes more sense than taking a pure burner, especially given Ross’ injury history. 11. New Orleans Saints \nDerek Barnett , DE, Tennessee Volunteers : The New Orleans Saints added another pick late in the first with the Brandin Cooks trade, and they’ll likely use both to address their holes on defense. They pick up a pass-rusher early, and some second-level help late. 12. Cleveland Browns (from Philadelphia) \nMitch Trubisky , QB, North Carolina Tar Heels : If the New England Patriots don’t give in and send Jimmy Garoppolo to the Browns for a second-rounder, they use their second pick of the first round on a quarterback. The Browns get their franchise quarterback in Trubisky. USATSI 13. Arizona Cardinals \nDeShone Kizer , QB, Notre Dame Fighting Irish : The Arizona Cardinals ’ window may have officially closed after Calais Campbell and Tony Jefferson walked in free agency, so they need to find the quarterback that will take over for Carson Palmer . Kizer has the size, arm, and tape to fit the bill. 14. Philadelphia Eagles (from Minnesota) \nMalik McDowell , DT, Michigan State Spartans : The Eagles’ signings of Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith knock a wide receiver off the board here. Instead, they swing over to McDowell, who helps make up for the loss of Bennie Logan to Kansas City. Given his build, he can play tackle or end for Philly. 15. Indianapolis Colts \nDalvin Cook , RB, Florida State : Cook’s versatility gives the Colts the kind of weapon they haven’t had out of the backfield during the Andrew Luck era. He can break off big gains via the run or the pass and play on all three downs. \nO.J. Howard , TE, Alabama: Howard isn’t just any tight end. He’s a ridiculous athlete and matchup nightmare that can give the Baltimore offense an explosiveness it has lacked in recent years. Howard will give the Ravens some pop on offense. USATSI 17. Washington Redskins \nZach Cunningham , OLB, Vanderbilt Commodores : Washington lost both its top receivers and free agency and there’s still uncertainty around Kirk Cousins , but run defense is still its biggest issue. Cunningham can come in right away and solidify an important area. 18. Tennessee Titans \nJohn Ross, WR, Washington: The Titans can’t rightly let Marcus Mariota enter Year 3 with Tajae Sharpe and Rishard Matthews as his top two wideouts. Ross would open up the field for everybody, in addition to being a great fit with Mariota’s passing style. 19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers \nObi Melifonwu , S, Connecticut Huskies : Melifonwu tested off the charts at the combine and seems firmly in the mix as a potential first-rounder. Tampa could use a complement to the recently-signed J.J. Wilcox at the safety position, and an athlete like Melifonwu would be a good fit. 20. Denver Broncos \nRyan Ramczyk , OT, Wisconsin : Romo, Siemian, Lynch, whoever: they need blind-side protection. The Broncos need to do a better job protecting the quarterback, whoever it may be. Ramczyk fits here. USATSI", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T16:36:27.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
