The pair have been travelling across Canada for the last year and a half. That’s a long time, eh? We’ll have to cut them some slack, because they’re doing it on foot. Bret and Nymeria are walking across Canada in the hopes of raising awareness for children’s mental health. Their goal is to get people talking about it. 2 \nDog owners know how much their little fur buddies love going on walks. So Nymeria, as you would expect, is perfectly happy to act as a sort of, mascot for this whole adventure. 3 \nTheir cross-country journey started in September of 2015, in Toronto. The two managed to walk all the way across to Whistler, B.C. in only 10 months. That wasn’t enough to fully satisfy Bret and Nymeria, though. So in September of 2016, the decided to walk from Toronto to St. John’s, Newfoundland, in order to make the walk a true coast-to-coast adventure. 4 \nCrossing the second largest country in the world on foot is no easy task. The journey is completely self funded, and the duo sleep in either a tent or an ice hut between walks. They also typically do their walking during the evening, as the highways are less busy. 5 \nThe journey has plenty of perks, and seeing the stunning scenery Canada has to offer is definitely one of them. Doing it all with a best friend as lovely as Nymeria? Well, that’s just a bonus.

There’s a certain stigma that people tend to have when it comes to actively talking about it. The journey of these two amazing beings is truly inspiring, and even just me, personally, needed that reminder to let my friends and family know that if they ever should need it, i’m there to listen. 7 \nBret and Nymeria now have their own go fund me page for anyone that would like to help support the final leg of their journey to the eastern most point of Canada.
