Anything is better than the past tumult.\n\nBut then you can’t help but get confused when you hear lyrics like these from the song “ My Collection ” off of Future’s latest album,  HNDRXX , lyrics that people say were aimed at Ciara:\n“She told me she was an angel/She f–ked two rappers and three singers/She got a few athletes on speed dial/I’m tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial/And these codeine habits ain’t got nothin’ to do with my lil’ child/No this codeine ain’t got nothin’ to do with my lil’ child.”\nBut then you also have lyrics like this, from the song “ Sorry ,” from the same album, that could also be in reference to the singer:\n“Ain’t really mean to hurt you/Sorry it has to be this way/Ain’t mean to desert you/Sorry that it looks that way.”\nSo how does Future really feel about the woman he’s had so much to say about since their split in 2014? We know that in the past, Ciara didn’t even want to speak that man’s name in public . Not to mention that at this point, she’s married and expecting her second child, her first with Russell Wilson. She’s started a whole new private life.\nHowever, “Nayvadius “Future” Wilburn seems a little more conflicted and has always been the one open about their ups and downs. But according to his chat with  Billboard , which he is on the cover of for the April 1 issue, overall, he’s happy — even if he feels like his ex gave up “on something real”:\nFuture insists he’s in a good place. “I feel like everything happened for a reason,” he says. “I’m happy with life now. I’m happy with life, period, even with the end of a ­relationship being…” He trails off, and when he starts up again the tone is more defiant. “I’m just not going to settle for anything, you know? Even in my life now, I know I can be a better person. I ain’t giving up on myself, so if you give up on me, I ain’t got nothing else to say for you. Because if you give up on ­something that’s real, it wasn’t real to you.”\nThat said, he doesn’t seem to have the ­fondest memories of the attempts he made to adapt himself to the relationship with Ciara, including cutting back on weed and codeine and the rest of his lengthy pharmacopoeia. “They had me going the cornball route!” he says with a bitter little laugh. And anyway, Future notes that not even the women he’s writing about — clearly not all Ciara — will know who the tracks are really about. “What the people don’t ­understand is, I been kicking it with superstars when it comes to females for a minute — on the low-low with nobody don’t know-know.” At which point Future cracks a big grin and laughs.\nInteresting response, right?\n \nImage via WENN  \nThe post Future Says Ciara Gave Up “On Something That’s Real” appeared first on MadameNoire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:52:25.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
