Klopp's side are 10 points off the pace (Photo: Getty) The defeat to Swansea leaves the Reds with just a two-point cushion over fifth-placed Man City (Photo: Getty) \n\"I don't see Liverpool winning the Premier League title with the defence they have,\" Nicol told ESPN FC. \n\"They don't look as if they are going to bring anyone in this window, which means they've got what they've got. View gallery \n\"When they let in goals that they have done - not just at Swansea, against Burnley - [they are] perfect examples that it's not happening. \n\"Bournemouth - four goals at Bournemouth. A team doesn't win the Premier League shipping goals in the way they do.\" \nNicol played for Liverpool for 14 years, winning five league titles, three FA Cups and the European Cup.
