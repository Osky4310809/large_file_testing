Luck is definitely on their side if Jon and Daenerys do team up. Not only did the two “find love,” they’re also both starring on one heck of a television show — which sounds like a total win-win to us! And as if that’s not cool enough, Emilia just posted this gorgeous shot of a shooting star on her Instagram — giving us all the more reason to be excited for the new year.\nEmilia shared the post of the shooting star on Instagram! A photo posted by @emilia_clarke on Dec 31, 2016 at 5:47am PST \nCatching such natural beauty had Emilia (and the rest of us) feeling pretty hopeful about 2017.\nShe captioned the picture, “Here’s to a new year of no filters and plenty of shooting stars. Here’s to hope.#2017wearecomingforyouatlighteningspeedandstrength” The close of 2016 hasn’t been the easiest. We’ve experienced so many losses, which has made many of us pretty anxious when thinking about what’s to come. However, if Emilia’s once-in-a-lifetime post is any indication to what we can expect in 2017, we’re definitely in for a treat. After all, how many people can say that they’ve seen an actual shooting star?\n\nWho knows…maybe some of Emilia’s extreme luck and positivity will rub off on the rest of us. We definitely need a little something great to look forward to.\nHere’s to a spectacular 2017 filled with strength, love, and lots of shooting stars!\nThe post Emilia Clarke captured a shooting star and it’s giving us so much hope for 2017 appeared first on HelloGiggles .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T00:29:22.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
