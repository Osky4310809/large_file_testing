PA photo The relatives of the victims of IRA violence have had mixed reactions to the death of Martin McGuinness. \nThe sister of a woman killed by the paramilitary group tweeted a list of atrocities and other victims. \nAnn Travers' sister Mary was gunned down and her judge father, Tom Travers, badly injured when they were ambushed by an IRA gang as they emerged from church in Belfast in April 1984. \nAnn Travers has since campaigned for victims' rights. Johnathan Ball, left, and Tim Parry died in an IRA bomb attack in Warrington in 1993 \nShe tweeted a picture of her sister and father, and wrote: \"Enniskillen Families, Claudy families, Hegarty family, Gillespie family, Maher family, I'm so sorry you never got the answers you deserved.\" \nMr McGuinness spoke out six years ago after a Sinn Fein member involved in the murder of Mary Travers was appointed to an influential adviser role at Stormont. \nHe said the killing had been \"absolutely wrong\" but added the adviser, Mary McArdle, would not be sacked from the role. \nSpeaking at the time he said: \"There is controversy now because Ann obviously feels very hurt and I respect the fact that she feels the way she feels but if we were to apply the rule that people who were part of the conflict can't be part of building a better future then Nelson Mandela would never have been president of South Africa.\" Alan McBride (whose wife and father in law where killed in the Shankill Bombing) speaking at a wreath laying ceremony in Talbot Street Dublin to mark the 42nd anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.

Martin McGuiness (left) meets Colin Parry \n\"The world is now a sweeter and cleaner place,\" Lord Tebbit told Good Morning Britain. \n\"He was a coward. The reason he suddenly became a man of peace, was that he was desperately afraid that he was going to be arrested and charged with a number of murders.\" \nMichael McConville, the son of Jean McConville, also reflected on Mr McgUinness's death 27 years after his mother became one of \"the disappeared\". \n\"I'm sad for his amily, I don't like seeing anybody die... but on the other hand Martin McGuinness did try to do an awful lot for the troubles with Northern Ireland I will say that about him,\" he said on BBC radio. \n\"I think he tried his best with the politics over here, I will say that about the man.\" \nThe younger sister of an IRA bombing victim has claimed \"the truth has died\" with Northern Ireland former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness. \nJulie Hambleton said relatives of many of the terrorist group's victims were still waiting for \"truth and justice\", following the death of the ex-IRA commander. \nShe claimed: \"He was very opaque and selective with the truth. \n\"With him the truth has died and that's the big problem.\" \nMs Hambleton, whose older sister Maxine was killed in the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings, offered her condolences to his family. \nBut she said many relatives of IRA victims were still waiting for answers about what happened to loved ones, including The Disappeared. \nShe added: \"People are piling the praise on him but it isn't valid. \n\"He didn't come forward with the truth.\" \nMs Hambleton, who leads the Justice4the21 campaign which last year won fresh inquests into the deaths of the pub bombings victims, said she still hoped other former IRA members would speak about what happened during The Troubles. \nShe said: \"I can but hope that lips will be looser, not just for our loved ones but for everybody's sake - many of whom still after all these years have no body to bury.\" \nVictims' campaigner Alan McBride - whose wife was killed in an IRA bomb on Belfast's Shankill Road - has said Northern Ireland owes a debt of gratitude to the late parliamentarian. \nMr McBride told BBC Radio Ulster that his \"fingerprints are all over the Troubles but they are also all over the peace process\". \nStephen Gault, who saw his father Samuel (49) killed by an IRA bomb in Enniskillen in November 1987. The then 18-year-old was also injured in the blast. \nThe IRA bomb exploded near the town's war memorial during a Remembrance Sunday ceremony, which was being held to commemorate British military war dead. Eleven people, many of them old-age pensioners, were killed and 63 were injured. \nSpeaking about the death of Mr McGuinness - who was once accused in a TV documentary of knowing in advance about the bombing - Mr Gault said he would always remember him as a terrorist, not a peacemaker. \n\"My feelings are with the Enniskillen families. Martin McGuinness has taken to the grave the truth and the answers that we need to be able to move forward. He knows who bombed Enniskillen. Initially my thoughts and prayers go out to the Enniskillen victims,\" said Mr Gault. \nHe added: \"I will always remember Martin McGuinness as the terrorist he was. If he had been repentant my thoughts might have been slightly different. But he took to his grave proud that he served in the IRA. There was no remorse or repentance from him even up to his death.\" \nMr Gault said he feared that Mr McGuinness would only be remembered as a peacemaker. \n\"My fear is Martin McGuinness is going to be remembered as this great peacemaker similar to the way Nelson Mandela was remembered after his death. My fear is that his horrific past will not be mentioned. \n\"People might say I am unchristian that I have no sympathy for his family. But it wasn't Christian to send people out to murder innocent people. \n\"Did the McGuinness family feel any sympathy for the Gault family when my father was cruelly and brutally murdered at the age of 49 by an IRA bomb? \n\"I have heard all this talk about how Martin McGuinness was only 66. My father was only 49 when he was murdered. He wasn't even 50. He was a very young man.\" \nFormer Ulster Unionist MP, Lord Kilclooney, said he \"despairs\" when he looks for a similar leader to Martin McGuinness in Sinn F√©in. \n\"As a victim of IRA assassination attempt when I was Minister at Home Affairs in Northern Ireland in 1972, I obviously watched the political progress of Martin McGuinness closely. He had an evil past but became a peacemaker - of that I have no doubt,\" he told the BBC. \n\"I extend my condolences to his family circle at this time but I look in despair at Sinn F√©in for someone with the same leadership qualities as Martin McGuinness.\" \nAdditional reporting by Press Association Online Editors", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:23:18.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
