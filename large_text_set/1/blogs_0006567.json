Frontman Chris Martin, the creative director of the festival's New York iteration, announced that the event would be free to those who perform various social tasks. The Mumbai show will use crowdfunding efforts through the website Ketto to raise money for children without parents and fund 25 children's homes across the country. Miracle Foundation, the non-profit partner, also will help enable education funds and scholarships. \nThe band recently revealed plans to release new music in 2017 . \"Hello everyone, we're working on some new songs for next year,\" the lead singer wrote. \"It's called the Kaleidoscope EP. We hope you're well, love cm.\" While they continue work on the EP, the group released a crowdsourced video last week for the A Head Full of Dreams track \"Amazing Day.\" They'll hit the road beginning August 1st for more North American shows.
