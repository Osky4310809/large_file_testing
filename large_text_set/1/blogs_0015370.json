If President Barack Obama commuted Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange would allow himself to be sent back to the U.S. to face charges for disseminating classified information.\nThat offer is being put to the test. On Tuesday afternoon, news broke that Obama had used his power as president to release Manning, a former army intelligence analyst, from prison as of May 17, 2017.\nWikiLeaks had made the offer in a tweet, which remains up.\nIf Obama grants Manning clemency Assange will agree to US extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case https://t.co/MZU30SlfGK \n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 12, 2017 \nIf Assange does indeed allow himself to be extradited, he will face charges surrounding his organization's acquisition of documents from Manning, who leaked a massive trove of government documents to WikiLeaks . Manning was found guilty of the act and sentenced to 35 years in prison. She has served nearly seven years of her sentence. \nAssange: \"Thank you to everyone who campaigned for Chelsea Manning's clemency. Your courage & determination made the impossible possible.\"\n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 17, 2017 \nAssange founded WikiLeaks in 2006. WikiLeaks acknowledged the clemency on Twitter, but did not comment on Assange.\nIn August, a lawyer for WikiLeaks claimed in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch that \"there is no legitimate basis for continuing the [Justice] Department's lengthy criminal investigation of Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks,\" on the basis that it did not break any laws and provided a public good in informing people of important issues.\nAn email sent to the WikiLeaks lawyer was not immediately returned.\nBONUS: Watch the White House ad with a Steve Jobs twist", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:46:35.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
