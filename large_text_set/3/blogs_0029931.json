But more than ever that applies off the pitch, as well as on it. \nScience in football is changing at a fast pace. The days of jumping in an ice bath or a wheelie bin full of freezing cold water post-match are becoming a thing of the past. \nMore and more clubs are introducing cryotherapy instead, with players exposed to temperatures as low as -150C for a few minutes to shock the body and help aid their recovery. \nThe treatment also allows players to train with greater intensity, reduce muscle soreness, aid sleep and provide an exhilarating post-chamber sensation.

It’s absolutely freezing but it helps you in your recovery so fair play to the club for getting that in.\" Leicester were big fans of the cryotherapy unit Foxes skipper Wes Morgan exits the chamber \nHowever, Fulham have taken things up a notch. \nThe Championship outfit have become the world's first elite sports club to introduce tailored full-body cryotherapy, teaming up with PolarFit Care, Air Products and ProCcare to give Slavisa Jokanovic’s men the best possible chance of success in their promotion push. \nThe likes of Tom Cairney , Chris Martin and Scott Parker all have personalised programs to help them achieve peak performance. \nThere has been a 94 per cent compliance among the first-team squad, with their academy starlets also buying into the new sports science unit which would set you back around £120,000 to purchase.

Murtagh dons the safety gear (Photo: DAILY MIRROR) \nFirst up was the pre-chamber of around -60C to ease me into it. If that was a shock to the system, nothing could prepare me for what lay ahead. \nI was plunged in at -130C. I was encouraged to keep on my toes to make the 150 seconds bearable. \nIt got worse as the clock ticked down, with my fingers, ankles and knees especially frozen to the core. \nI was relieved once the session was over, but once I had the chance to warm up, I started to feel the benefits.

It certainly helped me get a better night's sleep. \nIt’s certainly no wonder Cairney and Scott Malone are at the front of the queue at Motspur Park. \nFulham captain Cairney said: “I feel like the cryotherapy sessions do help me because I’ve played a lot of matches and a lot of minutes this season. It hits you deeper than an ice bath.” \nMalone added: “It helps with performance and it definitely makes us feel fresher. I certainly feel better for it in-game, so it’s obviously working.” Tom Cairney has been in stunning form for Fulham this season (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nFulham first-team physio Chris Hanson said: “We tailor most aspects of the players’ schedules, from training to therapy and even diet, based on things like body type, age and position in the team. \n“Any treatment that can be intelligently applied based on the needs of an individual player is bound to increase its effectiveness. A more tailored approach will improve the positive results of cryotherapy.” \nFulham have been frozen out of the Premier League for three seasons, but Jokanovic will be hoping this can help give them the edge over their promotion rivals in the latter stages of the campaign. poll loading Will Fulham make the play-offs? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T13:15:17.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
