That year, “Midnight Express” won six awards, three years after “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” first achieved that feat. Golden Globes: 25 Red Carpet Looks Ranked From Best to Worst (Photos) \nThere were bold and bright choices and also some train wrecks. Getty Images \n1. Yas to Janelle Monae. Only this \"Hidden Figures\" and \"Moonlight\" star could pull off something this bold and beautiful. Getty Images \n2. Issa Rae is working it in a floor length white gown. It's so chic. Getty Images \n3. Kristen Bell is stunning in this full length black sequin gown with an on-trend plunging neckline. Getty Images \n4. Evan Rachel Wood took a leap of faith with this pant-suit -- and nailed it. Getty Images \n5. Olivia Culpo's artsy gown worked in her favor. Getty Images \n6. Tracee Ellis-Ross is glowing in this silver sequined gown. Getty Images \n7. This is how you rock a yellow gown. Reese Witherspoon is flawless. FLAWLESS. Getty Images \n8. In a brown velvet suit, Donald Glover stands out among a sea of black tuxes. Getty Images \n9. Mandy Moore is Elvira chic in an all black, low cut gown. She was smart to do a nude lip otherwise it'd be too kitschy. Getty Images \n10. At 67, Judith Light's still got it. Getty Images \n11. Maisie Williams kept it simple and classy with this pretty yellow gown. Getty Images \n12. The top part of Jessica Biel's dress is exquisite, but the bottom portion is odd. Getty Images \n13. Ryan Gosling stands out in his white-on-black tux, but he also resembles a waiter. Getty Images \n14. Meh. Getty Images \n15. Sure, black is on trend, but Amara Karan's gown is swallowing her into a black hole. Getty Images \n16. Michael Shannon needed more time with his tailor. His tux is too small. Getty Images \n17. Brie Larson is clashing her eras. She's wearing the dress of a 1980's Texas beauty queen while her hair is a blast from the 1950s. Getty Images \n18. We don't know what Jessica Chastain was thinking with this blue dress featuring flowery sequins. Getty Images \n19. Natalie Portman is still stuck in her \"Jackie\" role in this 1960s avocado yellow frock. Getty Images \n20. Kerry Washington let us down with this awkward length, gold patterned dress and she usually never disappoints. At least her makeup is on point. Getty Images \n21. Karrueche's fuchsia prom-gown look is detracting from her natural beauty. Getty Images \n22. It looks like Zoe Saldana got caught in a fight with a cotton candy lace fabric machine... and lost. Getty Images \n23. We love that Pharrell Williams always tries to make a statement but his beanie totally clashes with his suit. It's not even beanie weather. Also, Helen Lasichanh's bo-ho dress doesn't fit the theme. Getty Images \n24. 1980s cocaine chic? Sophie Turner looks like she stepped out of the \"Billionaire Boys Club\" or \"Less Than Zero.\" Getty Images \n25. Emily Ratajkowski needed more time with her double-sided tape. Under-boob is a tacky look for any red carpet. Getty Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T07:07:20.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
