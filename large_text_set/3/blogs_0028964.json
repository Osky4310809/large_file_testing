I tried everything to recover but unfortunately my hip is still not 100% so I can't compete at the level I want to. \n\"I'll face this challenge with a positive attitude and can't wait to get back with the team and be stronger. \n\"Thanks everyone for your support!\" \nSpurs' official Twitter account broke the news on Wednesday, tweeting: \"Erik Lamela is to undergo surgery on his hip on Saturday. This will result in Erik returning to action next season. \n\"The Argentina international has undergone a comprehensive rehabilitation process following the injury in November.
