Mike Chiari Featured Columnist March 22, 2017 Washington may have landed its quarterback of the future Wednesday, as it received a commitment from highly touted signal-caller Colson Yankoff. \"Washington has been in my top 3 from the very beginning of my recruiting process,\" Yankoff said, per Tom Loy of 247Sports. \"It would be redundant and obvious to talk about how accomplished the UW staff is. I value my education, playing in the PAC 12, competing for championships, and the absolute integrity of this coaching staff. This is about fit to me, and I do not believe there is a better fit in the country for me.\" According to Scout.com , Yankoff is a 4-star recruit who ranks as the No. 151 overall prospect, No. 15 player at his position and No. 1 quarterback from the state of Idaho. Yankoff has great measurables, as Scout lists him at 6'4\" and 200 pounds to go along with an estimated 40-yard dash time of 4.67 seconds. That represents big-time speed at the quarterback position, which is likely a big reason he was initially linked to Oregon. Yankoff committed to play for the Ducks originally, but he decommitted in December 2016 due to the firing of head coach Mark Helfrich and quarterbacks coach David Yost, as told to Loy (h/t CBSSports.com ): \nI committed to coach [Helfrich] , coach [Yost] and that Oregon staff. Things have changed and based on the current situation, my family and I believe it's in my best interest to open up my recruitment and reevaluate things. At this time, I'm not going to do any other interviews. Thank you for your understanding. I'm open to any and all schools at this time. Yankoff's change of heart led to several new schools entering the fray, including Baylor, Nebraska, Oregon State, TCU, Tennessee, Utah and Washington State, per Scout.com . While Yankoff isn't necessarily from a football-rich area in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, he became the target of programs from across the country. Coeur d'Alene High School head coach Shawn Amos expressed his belief that whatever team landed him would be getting a quarterback capable of excelling in all areas, according to Todd Milles of the News Tribune : \"He has no black marks—no weaknesses. He can throw the ball with anybody. He's a great leader. He's humble. He's the complete package—one of the top 10 quarterbacks in the country.\" Yankoff is a true dual-threat quarterback who can beat the opposition with his accurate arm or his agile legs. His versatility should play well in the current college football landscape, especially after Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson won the Heisman Trophy in 2016. While Yankoff is nowhere near that level yet, the Huskiesexpressed great confidence in his ability to develop into a top-flight starter.
