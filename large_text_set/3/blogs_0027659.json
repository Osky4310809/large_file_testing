At least that’s what Atlanta Falcons cornerback Robert Alford thinks after watching Favre throw bullet passes this week.\nFavre stopped by Traction Sports Performance in Baton Rouge, La., where Alford was training, stepped onto the field in his street clothes and fired darts to receivers. He missed a couple, but hey, who expects him to be perfect?\nHad the G.O.A.T. Brett Favre out throwing today. I asked him to come out retirement to throw a pick to me. J/P cool guy… #TAT pic.twitter.com/FljsvBSIXh \n— Robert Alford (@rockorocky) March 22, 2017 \n\nAlford told TMZ Favre didn’t even warm up and thinks he still could play if he had a good offensive line that allowed him to sit back and sling. Alford also asked Favre, the career leader in interceptions (336), to come out of retirement and throw him a pick, but he’d better be careful — Alford had a pick-six of Tom Brady in the Super Bowl, and that didn’t end so well for the Falcons.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:24:47.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
