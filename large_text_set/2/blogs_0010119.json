Also, listen to newer music, kids.\nVirginia Tech moshes after beating Virginia Congratulations, Virginia Tech! You just knocked off No. 12 Virginia in double overtime on your home floor. It’s not just a victory over your biggest rival, it’s also a huge boost to your NCAA tournament resume. How will you celebrate?\nTurns out the answer is: moshing to Metallica’s “Enter Sandman”. Who knew?\nThis song came out in 1991. Current college students were mostly born between 1995-1999. Fortunately (?), it lives forever on alternative rock radio alongside “Smells Like Teen Spirit”, anything from “Ten” and that one Alice In Chains song.\nKids, my advice: listen to Rancid 2000 and never look back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:55:12.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
