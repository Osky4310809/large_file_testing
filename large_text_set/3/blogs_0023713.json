That code, plus a customer’s PIN number, will allow the withdraw of cash. \n“Security certainly was a big aspect of the cardless feature and the two-step identification helps reduce the risk of fraud,” Jonathan Velline, the head of ATM and branch banking for Wells Fargo, told the news agency. \n(But what if the fraud is coming from inside the house ?) Now when you get held up at an ATM thieves can take your phone as well as your cash. Progress! \nImage: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nNot having to enter a physical card at ATMs would greatly reduce the risk posed by card skimmers, and would make it possible to leave your debit card at home when you head out on the town. \nWells Fargo is not the only bank attempting to go cardless when it comes to ATM transactions. Bank of America has allowed customers to use Apple Pay to withdraw cash since 2016, and ATM-solutions companies FIS and Payment Alliance International (PAI) worked together last year to bring cardless withdraws to over 70,000 ATMs. \nBasically, not needing your debit card to get cash is the way of the future. Or was it Bitcoin ATMs that were the way of the future? Hmm. We forgot. Either way, the future is totally here and it’s totally cardless.
