The new contract goes into effect immediately and impacts the newest members of SEIU Local 26 in Minnesota, who clean Best Buy, Target, Macy's, Cub Foods and Lunds & Byerlys stores. Those 500 janitors work for Carlson Building Maintenance in White Bear Lake, the Innovative Facility Servcies (IFS) Group in South Carolina and Prestige Maintenance's Major Metro subsidiary in the Twin Cities. Those janitors won the right to join the SEIU over the summer after years of strikes and protests that urged several large U.S. cleaning firms and their big box clients to improve work conditions and pay for the janitorial workers who cleaned stores each night. However, the janitors were not allowed to unionize and had long maintained that they were subject to abuses by the cleaning firm employers. Past complaints included being forced to work seven days a week, being denied overtime pay and being ordered to change work shifts without prior notice. Several complaints landed in court and some resulted in fines issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In most cases, the janitorial firms denied wrongdoing, while their big box clients such as Target urged the cleaning firms to talk to their workers and to improve relationships, work conditions and rules. The janitors on Wednesday expressed delighted in winning their first labor contract with the Carlson Building Maintenance, one that will raise pay, normalize work rules and give them a voice. The new contract will result in $4.5 million in wage increases and paid time-off over the life of the three-year labor agreement. Retail janitors will receive an average 18 percent pay raise over 3 years, with most seeing an immediate $1.50 raise per hour. Lizbet Vega Lopez, who cleaned the Cub Foods store in Brooklyn Park for Carlson Building Maintenance for 12 years, said her pay will instantly jump from $9.50 an hour to $11. \"I am glad we stuck together and that we now have a union contract that moves us forward. It was a big win just to get to the negotiation table with our employers, and now we have won gains that cannot be taken away,\" said Vega Lopez, a mother of three. Union leaders praised the contract as a big win for the 500 janitors, many of whom are low income, immigrants and people of color. Maricela Flores, a contract negotiator who works for Carlson Building Maintenance at the Shakopee Target said \"We fought hard to get to this point, so it means so much to have won this first contract. … Over the years we marched, picketed, organized our workplaces and went on strike multiple times, each time growing stronger despite facing long odds. Especially now, it is so important to remember something we've said throughout our campaign: 'When We Fight, We Win.' … We now have a contract that won big gains for our families.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:04:29.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
