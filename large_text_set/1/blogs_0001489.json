File photo \nMANILA, Philippines â€” A unnamed member of the Philippine Navy ordered the attack on inmate Jaybee Sebastian during a riot at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) last September, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said, citing the attacker's affidavit. \nTomas Donina, Sebastian's attacker, claimed in his affidavit that a former colleague promised his release from the NBP as a reward if he killed the convicted drug lord. \nAccording to Aguirre, Donina also implicated Senators Antonio Trillanes IV, Leila de Lima and the Liberal Party in the incident. Trillanes is a member of the Nacionalista Party. \nREAD: Trillanes behind attack on Jaybee? \nDonina claimed that the naval officer who supposedly ordered Sebastian's killing said that the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte will go down and the Liberal Party will go back in power, the STAR reported. \nThe Liberal Party is in the majority blocks of both the Senate and the House. The party, whose ranks have thinned since the May 2016 elections, has denied rumors that it is plotting to oust the president.   \nIn his affidavit, Donina also said that the naval officer asked him if he could help \"silence\" Sebastian to stop him from speaking against De Lima at congressional hearings. \nIn an interview with radio dzMM on Wednesday morning, Aguirre said that he immediately cleared De Lima and Trillanes after seeing Donina's affidavit. \n\"Wala talagang kasong puwedeng i-file sa dalawang senador,\" Aguirre said. \nIn a separate interview with GMA News TV, Aguirre said that he decided to transfer Sebastian from the NBP to the National Bureau of Investigation Detention Center for the convict's safety. \nThe Justice secretary added that Sebastian's wife asked to have him transferred for fear for his life after the riot at the NBP's Building 14. \nSebastian was stabbed during a riot inside Building 14 of the NBP last year. Two other high-profile inmates were injured while another one was killed during the stabbing incident. - Patricia Lourdes Viray", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T06:28:54.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
