Aminu Tambuwal, represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Bashir Garba, said the government had given priority to issues of women, children and other vulnerable groups. \nTambuwal noted that women have been playing creditable roles in the political and socioeconomic development of the state, assuring that the administration would not discriminate against them. \nThe governor challenged women in the country to participate more actively in party politics and other spheres of national development. \nAlso, the Speaker, Sokoto State House of Assembly, Alhaji Salihu Maidaji, said women had contributed immensely to humanity, literature and warfare. \nRepresented by the House Leader, Alhaji Garba Bello, the speaker, however, noted that ”over the years, women have been relegated to the background in politics, education, public service and businesses.” \nIn a message to the event, the Executive Director, United Nations Fund For Population Activities (UNFPA), Prof. Babatunde Osotimehin, declared that “gender equality is a human right.” \nRepresented by the Head of UNFPA Kaduna Sub Office, Mrs Mariama Darboe, Osotimehin stressed that women were entitled to live in dignity and freedom from want, fear and discrimination. \n”Gender equality is also vital to sustainable development and security. It is not just a women issue. It is an issue for all humanity. \n‘`Sadly, despite some progress, the world still has a long way to go to achieve full gender equality.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:44:43.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
