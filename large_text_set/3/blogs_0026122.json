Rolex \nIt's the story of Rolex and the technicolor dream watch. \nThe Swiss watchmaker has unveiled a brand-new addition to its Yacht-Master watch collection at this year's Baselworld, the biggest annual watch trade show in the world. \nWhat makes it so unique? A crown of multi-colored jewels graces the rotating bezel â€” 32 sapphires, eight tsavorites, and one diamond, to be exact. \nThough gems have graced Yacht-Master bezels before, they've never been on the 40 mm model, and they've never been this vibrant, according to Hodinkee . \nThe gems are set in a case made from Rolex's proprietary 18k rose gold alloy called \"Everose,\" and are paired with an Oysterflex rubber band. It's undoubtedly a sport watch, and one that will catch the average person's eye. \nPricing is not available for the piece yet, but we expect the gems to carry a premium over the standard Yacht-Master II 40mm in Everose 's $24,950 suggested retail. \nRolex", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:30:51.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
