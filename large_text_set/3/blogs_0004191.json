So after coming through that painful experience, the current problems at Anfield will not faze him. \nThe Reds ’ form went into free-fall during the 24-year-old’s month-long absence on international duty — the dismal defeat at Leicester this week means Jurgen Klopp’s men have managed just ONE Premier League win since the turn of the year. \nThe decline has seen Liverpool not just slip out of the title race but drop out of the top four.

You have to work harder for the next game and be sure you are mentally strong. \n“It was my uncle’s car. When I called my uncle, it was a big surprise. \n\"I know the people of Senegal and they are very supportive. Maybe two or three people did something, but generally I get big support from the people of Senegal. \n“At Liverpool, we have the best fans in the league, the best fans in the world. \n\"This team can do so much more with their support behind us, they help us so much.” \nThere have been so many stories down the years of players reporting late after tournaments but that was never going to happen in Mane’s case.

But his impact was really felt the following week when he scored twice in a Man of the Match display against top-four chase rivals Tottenham. \nThat is what Liverpool will be hoping for against Arsenal — a big reaction after a defeat and a big performance from a player who has better statistics (11 goals and four assists in 22 games) than Chelsea’s Eden Hazard.

You have to help your team, try to fight for the future and get back as soon as possible. \n\"I wanted to play again straight away. I think mentally I was ready, even though I was tired. \n“I’m convinced that we are going to change it positively. We have a great team, great spirit and we have a great mentality. We are going to work hard to really turn it round.” \nMane was one of the most sought-after players in the Premier League when Liverpool signed him last summer — Manchester United tried to get him from Saints the previous year, and Manchester City had also been keen.

Win, lose or draw, which can always happen, we always come back and we are always looking forward for a positive reaction. Sometimes it’s easy - and sometimes it’s not easy! \n“I am very lucky to have the coach here. As a player, you always have to think about where you are going, what you can do there and I had another options. Jurgen Klopp is a great manager, a great person as well. From when he met me, he made it so easy for me to adapt not just in the team but also at the club as well. Liverpool was the only place for me. \n“Everybody was disappointed after Leicester, because we played great football in the Tottenham game and how we lost [to the champions] was not easy.

It was 2, 3 and then 4-1 [Liverpool scored three times in 14 second-half minutes, with Mane getting the last one] and then suddenly Arsenal have come back and it finished 4-3. \n\"It was a good memory from the past because we won the game and we are looking to win again.\" poll loading Who will win on Saturday? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:44:04.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
