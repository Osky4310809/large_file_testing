Photos Feb 17, 2017 at 1:05pm PST \nUnlike many celebrities, especially those around her age, Hill says she does not wear much makeup. \n\"I used to wear tons of makeup, like that '80s caked-on makeup,\" she said. \"It's the reason I rarely wear it now unless I absolutely have to.\" \nMcGraw, she added, likes her natural look. \n\"He likes when I have no makeup on and crazy-curly hair,\" she said. \"Before I put it up in my ponytail, he always tells me to wear it down because it's his favorite.\" \nHill teaches her daughters to embrace their inner beauty. \n\"Social media can be so cruel, but we've always emphasized the importance of having a realistic take and a healthy view regarding beauty to our girls,\" Hill told the outlet. \"They know it's not just on the outside. It's really important to us to teach them that beauty is on the inside. People can see your heart by the expressions on your face and by the way you carry yourself—they can see your happiness.\" TAGS/ Faith Hill , Tim McGraw , Top Stories , Beauty  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:08:34.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
