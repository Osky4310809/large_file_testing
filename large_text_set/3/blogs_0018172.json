In a fashion typical of Cyanogen’s younger days, Nintendo was told to “stick it”.\n@romainguy @dnaltews @rebelleader In the early days of cyanogen Nintendo wanted us to create an os for a certain portable. I told them to stick it.\n— Kirt McMaster (@kynprime) March 21, 2017 \n\nKirt also commented that the Nintendo Switch “is mostly custom kernel”, and it uses bits of Android. The Nintendo Switch software runs upon a FreeBSD kernel and includes Android components like the Stagefright multimedia framework.\n@romainguy @dnaltews @rebelleader Was under consideration. Switch is mostly custom kernel. They used bits of android.\n— Kirt McMaster (@kynprime) March 21, 2017 \n\nIt is interesting to imagine a future where one of the most popular Nintendo consoles would have been powered by one of most ambitious startups that originated from the Android third-party community. The combination would certainly have had put Cyanogen Inc. on the global map and outside the limited scope it saw during its lifetime. But seeing that the Nintendo Switch by itself was a gamble, coming after disappointing performance by the Wii U and in the midst of strong competition from mobile gaming, perhaps it wouldn’t have been a recipe for success.\nWhat are your thoughts on the failed opportunity between Nintendo and Cyanogen?
