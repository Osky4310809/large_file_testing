It saw about 100,000 visitors in 2015, compared to nearly 118,500 in 2014. \nIt also has experienced transition pains, with a dispute over artistic direction erupting between new and older board members in 2015. Then new trustee Theaster Gates, the hip, nationally renowned installation artist, had proposed a committee that would oversee programming in tandem with nearby University of Chicago, where he is a professor. The museum’s old-school supporters, deeply distrusting of the university, cried foul. \nHowever, the museum, deeply revered by Chicago’s black community for its unfiltered narrative of black history rarely found elsewhere, has held steady, and under Irmer achieved the prestigious status of Smithsonian Affiliation from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. last year. \nBesides Gates, other current board members include longtime State Sen. Emil Jones, Jr.; the Rev. Byron T. Brazier of Apostolic Church of God; restaurateur and businessman Timothy Rand; Englewood Square developer Leon Walker; and longtime hospital exec Joyce W. Washington. \nAppointment of Chance and his father, and Whitaker, fall in line with a vision early espoused by Irmer to re-focus on the museum’s mission of sparking inter-generational dialogue; as well as a vision of DuSable and other South South Side institutions to have the presidential center anchor a Museum Campus South, a proposal backed by Choose Chicago.
