There is a quantum of things that that can frustrate your driving. The most obvious one is the notorious traffic while others are the reckless danfo s who act as if they own the road and the shenanigans of the traffic wardens. \nThis said, there are some seniors and elderly ones who still drive in Lagos.

Perhaps, it is time to get them a driver. Older person driving \nThey get lost in familiar locations \nA senior has been driving this particular location for several years. But suddenly you receive a call that they do not yet return. Meanwhile, he has been driving around this familiar location for hours. If this is the case, you should just stop them from driving. \nThey don’t want to drive at night \nFor a fairly young driver, it is difficult to concentrate while driving at night let alone a senior. So, if they are reluctant to drive especially at night, it may be a signal that it is time to quit the wheels. \nTheir vision declines \nAnyone with poor vision should not drive. Hence, the more you get older, the more your vision deteriorate. According to research, your vision declines significantly especially when you are 75 and above. So, don’t ignore vision complaints from a senior who drives. \nThey get confused by traffic lights \nIf a senior cannot recognize simple traffic lights, it is time them to stop driving. For example, if a traffic light says stop and they move; you should be very concerned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:22:18.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
