Everybody hugs everybody and everybody kisses everybody. \n\"When you have bad results there is normally a tendency for that to be delayed and sometimes things even degenerate and there is no way back. \n\"But we were calm, we were not in hell and in this moment we are stable again and we are not in heaven.\" \nAnd Mourinho insists he has felt no pressure from the board throughout their inconsistent start, stating he has been given time to get the team back to the top of English football. \nMan Utd fans claim Griezmann is a done deal \n\"The board always told me 'you are here for three years, keep doing your job, no bad results will change our idea of having you here for a long time'. \n\"I think this relationship can last a long time because it was not based on good results, it was based on reality, what we saw day to day.\" \nUnited will be looking to extend their hot streak when they take on Reading in the FA Cup on Saturday, before they take on Hull City on Tuesday and hosting Liverpool at Old Trafford a few days later.
