(Photo: Christophe Ena, AP) \nEmma Watson is still defining her feminism, so don’t expect a book from her on the subject just yet. \nThe actress and founder of gender equality initiative HeForShe , who covers the March issue of Elle UK , tells the magazine : \"I need to see and do a bit more first. I'm no expert, and when people push me into a corner of ‘here's Emma Watson to lecture you on feminism’, it's uncomfortable because I am aware I have a long way to go. I am not sure I deserve all the respect I get yet, but I'm working on it.\" Emma Watson to U.N.: Women and minorities' safety is 'a right and not a privilege' \nAnd while Watson — who is the first to admit her privilege — continues to negotiate what her feminism looks like, who it centers and how it challenges (or reinforces) intersectional oppressions, she's also learning to deal with the pressures of working out that learning in a public space. \n\"There is a level of criticism that comes with being an actress and a public figure, which I expect,\" says the Beauty and the Beast star, \"but once you take a stance on something like feminism, that's a completely different ball game.\" \n\"It really toughened me up,\" she says of the criticism she's received. \nBut, at the same time, Watson rightfully acknowledges the mission isn’t about her. The real goal? \"Let’s see what we can do to ‘move the needle’ and make a difference.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:08:58.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
