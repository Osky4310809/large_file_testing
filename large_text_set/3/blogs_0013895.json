But since the CGC is not a serving customs officer the senate lacks the vires to force him to wear any uniform. \n“The suit challenging the legal validity of Col. Hameed Ali’s appointment has been dismissed on the ground that the President has the power to appoint a non-customs officer to head the customs service. Since the court has held that he is not a customs officer, Col. Ali cannot be made to wear any uniform. \n“I challenge the Senate to refer to any law that supports the wearing of uniform by the head of customs service, who is not a serving customs officer.” \nFalana added that customs officers are not being made to wear uniforms in other countries including South Africa. \nHe said, “In many countries, including South Africa, customs officers do not wear uniforms. \n“In Nigeria they wear uniforms because under the defunct military junta security outfit under the defunct military junta security agencies claimed that they were either military or paramilitary forces. It was part of the intimidation of the civilian population.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:34:22.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
