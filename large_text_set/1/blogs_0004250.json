It stated the expected increase in fiscal spending by Trump’s administration would cause “US growth and inflation to skyrocket, forcing the Federal Reserve to accelerate its hikes and the US dollar to hit the moon.” \nThe dollar would be an attractive currency for foreign investors. That will create a “domino effect in emerging markets and China, in particular, leading people globally to look for alternative forms of currencies and payment systems not tied to central banks,” said chief economist at Saxo Bank Steen Jakobsen. \nHe added that bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency would benefit from that chaos. “We could see bitcoin easily triple over the next year going from the current level to $2,100,” Jakobsen said. \nBitcoin was trading at around $900 in the first week of January, up from $400 at the start of 2016. \nThe digital currency’s price would rise partly due to Chinese investors seeking higher returns. China accounts for about 90 percent of all bitcoin trading on exchanges. The country has strict capital controls, which makes it difficult for the Chinese to convert the yuan into foreign currency, and limits the amount of cash investors can move abroad. “ #Bitcoin takes out $2,000 in 2017 as the $USD forces emerging markets to seek alternatives”- #OutragousPredictions : https://t.co/gDB8n4HBfY pic.twitter.com/FVqeNdexFp — Saxo Bank (@saxobank) December 16, 2016 \nSome analysts echo Saxo Bank’s prediction, saying the price of bitcoin will continue to rise as more devaluations are expected from the Chinese government. \nThe slower appreciation of the US dollar against the Chinese yuan in comparison to bitcoin against the greenback shows that Saxo Bank’s $2,000 forecast is not unrealistic, they add.
