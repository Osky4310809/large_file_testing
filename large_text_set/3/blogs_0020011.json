This is a new tradition, of course, as last year he came back and started flying through tables/jumping off Hell in a Cell onto the Undertaker. \n\nAfter his long, 7 year sabbatical from WWE, Shane is back and it looks like he will be a prominent on-screen character for years to come, which of course means he is back to doing ridiculous shit that most 47 year-old, non-wrestlers would not be doing, and I’m so in for it. Simply put, Shane O’Mac puts asses in seats, particularly mine. I lose interest in WWE here and there, and then during Mania season Undertaker comes back, Shane starts going crazy, and I am like “god dammit, I’m sucked way backed in”. AJ Styles is probably too talented for this match, but then again, Shane is too crazy to not make it awesome. \nThe face when you realize how sore you’re going to be tomorrow:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:42:00.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
