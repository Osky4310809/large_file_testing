The idea has a kind of commonsense wisdom about it, in the same way that people are apt to confuse short-term cold weather and long-term climate change. But as President Obama said Tuesday night, \"Without some common baseline of facts\" and the belief that \"science and reason matter, we'll keep talking past each other.\" Bogus vaccine views at GOP debate It's crucial that a bastion of quality medicine like the Cleveland Clinic, with a reputation that people trust, consistently does its part in supporting important public health messages for people who aren't scientists and doctors. The same used to be true of the White House, which   establishing important presidential commissions that have positively influenced public policy. When President Obama established the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, which published an influential report on ethics in neuroscience, he notably appointed respected scientists and scholars to the body, not a wayward Kennedy. So what are the baseline facts about vaccines and autism? The latest research finds abnormal brain development associated with autism occurring early in gestation well before birth and the first vaccination. We know that autism isn't purely a genetic condition, as it isn't always shared by identical twins. Some aspect of the environment is probably at play, but numerous large analyses rule out vaccines as a factor. Second-level analyses that eliminate even more variables, like one looking only at Japanese children in order to limit the influence of differing genetics as much as possible, continue to show no relationship between the most contested measles-mumps-rubella vaccination and autism. Then there's thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative that's used in trace amounts in some vaccines, and which draws much of the suspicion from anti-vaxxer parents. But thimerosal exposures bear no relation to autism onset either. Yet another Cleveland Clinic doctor wrote the foreword to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s scare-mongering book implicating thimerosal for a host of childhood problems. Government ultimately holds quite limited authority over vaccinations. None of us is outright forced to vaccinate; diehards can find alternative schools and alternative careers. And when a state senator in California drafted a bill requiring vaccinations for schoolchildren, the anti-vaxxers attempted to recall him.

It now appears his nods to the fringe made during the campaign may well translate into official acts and policies. Presidential commissions are serious affairs that address issues of major national importance. Creating such a panel on autism with a leading vaccine skeptic would do enormous damage, regardless of what the commission concludes. If the fringe on vaccines becomes mainstream, our health will be in grave danger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T01:36:55.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
