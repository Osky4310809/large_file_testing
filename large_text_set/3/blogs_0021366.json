Just ask Andre Roberson . During Monday night’s game against the Warriors , Roberson was at the line for two freebies but it did not go well at all.\nHis first shot bounced straight off the backboard. He tried to follow it up with a putback and airballed that as well. Then he airballed his second actual free throw.\nWhew, this was not a good sequence for Roberson. Roberson is shooting 43 percent from the free-throw line this season and shoots 50 percent for his career. That’s ugly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:16:42.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
