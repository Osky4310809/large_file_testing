Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nMartin O’Malley, the former Democratic presidential candidate who also goes by “unidentified man” in the pages of the Wall Street Journal, rallied Utah Democrats Saturday night, and though he wore a suit, O’Malley gave the impression he was ready to roll up his sleeves, hit the streets, and kick some fascist ass if necessary. \nOne thing’s certain: there was no appetite to unite behind the president after Jan. 20, as O’Malley made clear a day before the Utah Democratic Party Legislative Gala. . @repjohnlewis is right. Trump wasnt popularly elected. A fascist candidacy based on racist fears & Russian help should never be legitimized \n— Martin O'Malley (@MartinOMalley) January 14, 2017 \nWow, O’Malley packs his tweets tightly — he managed to hit the popular vote, fascism, racism, Russian hacking, and an illegitimate candidacy all in one post. But that was just the warm-up for Saturday night’s gala event with O’Malley. Now is not the time for reconciliation. Dietrich Bonhoeffer didn't reconcile with the Nazis. MLK didn't reconcile with the KKK. Now we fight pic.twitter.com/BoQNl0on1N \n— Martin O'Malley (@MartinOMalley) January 15, 2017 @MartinOMalley fight? With what? You're afraid of pop-tart guns. \n— Mr. Robinson (@TheStormCro) January 15, 2017 \nO’Malley was pretty shameless about evoking images of fighting Nazis and the KKK, considering how quickly he buckled and apologized to #BlackLivesMatter protesters at Netroots Nation after making the unforgivable “mistake” of saying — gasp! — “all lives matter.” \nIn any case, O’Malley’s speech didn’t seem to draw much coverage by the national media, so it’s important for social media to disseminate his call for Democrats to fight the GOP just as hard as Democrats fought the Nazis and formed, um, fought the KKK. @MartinOMalley Bonhoeffer was hanged. MLK was shot. You're just unhinged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T16:02:08.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
