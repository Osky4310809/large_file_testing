(Photo: USA TODAY Sports Images) \nA discussion that began on Reddit from user JayStarr1082 had this proposal for the NBA's All-Star Celebrity Game for one of the first appearances that now-former President Barack Obama could do with some of his free time: \nJust hear me out. \nI was just thinking, since it likely will be a very long time from now that we have a relatively young, well-respected and basketball-loving former President like Obama just leaving the oval office around the all-star break, that now would be the perfect time to let him play in the celebrity game. \nHe doesn't have to play more than like 5 minutes, and obviously the rest of the players will take it easy since he'll be the oldest guy on the court. Just imagine the eruption from the stands the first time he enters the game, touches the ball, or shoots a 3. It doesn't even have to go in. That'll easily be the highlight of the evening regardless of what happens after that.It's a great idea for pretty much everyone involved, assuming he'd be willing to do it. \nSB Nation's Tom Ziller also had this idea, beginning a petition earlier this month as Obama's term was winding down. \nAs Reddit users pointed out, a member of Obama's administration - former US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan - has played in the game before and put on an incredible showing: \nDuncan had this endorsement of his former boss wh en speaking to For The Win 's Charles Curtis this week: \n\"He's a fantastic defensive player. He's long, he understands angles, he understands how to force opponents into their weaknesses. Offensively, he's very crafty, very deceptive, will cut back door on you, has a very good crossover dribble. He'll knock down a shot when he's open.\" \nIn 2010, Obama pulled in some NBA players to entertain the troops, so it wouldn't even be his first time facing off against the best. The write-up from ESPN: \nPresident Barack Obama pulled together an informal dream team of current and former basketball superstars Sunday. But only a few people got to see it. \nLeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah and other NBA stars joined Obama in Washington to entertain wounded troops.
