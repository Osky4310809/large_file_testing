But he told Ryan something was missing. \nTrump asked lawmakers to include the massive infrastructure spending project that he promised voters during the campaign. \nNow it's been added to the GOP's already packed to-do list, outlined at the Republican retreat at a hotel in downtown Philadelphia. It's not clear whether it will match Trump's $1 trillion proposal for repairing the nation's crumbling roads and bridges, but infrastructure is now \"front and center,\" according to those who heard details of the GOP plan. \n\"The impression I got is that the speaker recognized the importance of that to the president and that it is now part of our 200-day plan,\" Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., a member of the House Republican leadership team, said of the infrastructure proposal. \"Initially, without the president's input, that would not have been the case. But our president has been pretty clear on setting his priorities.\" \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts   news desk and delivered to your inbox.

And it's one they hope Congress can complete in the coming months. It includes getting a comprehensive tax reform bill on Trump's desk by August and the repeal and replacement of Obamacare by March. \nAnd there is much more. \nTrump has also added to the GOP to-do list a special spending bill to pay for the long-promised wall on the Mexican border, which Collins said could have a price tag of \"eight to ten billion\" dollars. \nRepublican leaders outlined the agenda to rank-and-file lawmakers at the GOP retreat in downtown Philadelphia on Wednesday. Trump, who will address lawmakers on Thursday, was back at the White House, signing an executive order to start building the wall. \n\"They put up a chart,\" Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., said after a session with lawmakers. \"There was a lot on it.\" Also  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T04:08:43.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
