AP/Aaron Favila, file MANILA, Philippines ( Philippine News Agency ) -- The governments of the Philippines and Japan recently signed a program document to ensure cooperation on the treatment and rehabilitation of the country’s illegal drug users. The signatories were officials of member-agencies of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Establishment and Support of Drug Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation Centers (DATRCs) Throughout the Country led by its chairperson, Undersecretary John Castriciones of the Department of the Interior and Local Government. Japan, through the Japan International Cooperation Agency, was represented by Takahiro Morita, who signed the program document for Comprehensive Assistance for Rehabilitation in in Malacañang on January 13, 2017. “The goal of the CARE program is to establish treatment and rehabilitation facilities and strengthen policies of treatment protocol and interventions for drug dependents nationwide,” said PDEA Director General Isidro Lapeña. He added that JICA has committed to supporting the program by extending a grant aid as a token of friendship and cooperation between the two countries. “In addition to JICA, donations in significant portions to the DATRC Task Force continue to pour in from local and international benefactors to help build more drug treatment facilities nationwide,” Lapeña said. The DATRC Task Force, whose powers and functions include the determination of suitable locations of the DATRCs and their establishment and provision of operational support mechanism, is composed of the DILG, Department of Health, Department of Social Welfare and Development, Department of Budget and Management, Office of the President and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. The PDEA chief said the number of drug dependents who have voluntarily surrendered to the authorities is still growing by the day. “That is why the long-term goal here is to have at least one DATRC in every province, as mandated by law. With the overwhelming financial support the task force is receiving, more DATRCs will be built that would cover the treatment and rehabilitation of more drug dependents throughout the country,” he said. At present, there are only 16 DOH-accredited government drug rehabilitation centers operating in the country, and the increasing number of in-house patients is straining the capacity of such facilities and their personnel beyond their limits.
