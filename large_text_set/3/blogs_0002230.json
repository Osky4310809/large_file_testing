That also explains why the Blackhawks re-acquired defenseman Johnny Oduya from the Dallas Stars on Tuesday night in exchange for Mark McNeill and a conditional fourth-round pick. It becomes a third-round pick if the Blackhawks reach the Western Conference Final and Oduya plays 50% of his team’s games. \nOduya played for the Blackhawks’ Stanley Cup championship teams in 2013 and 2015 before signing with the Stars as a free agent. \nQuenneville always had confidence in Oduya, but the Blackhawks were forced to let him go because of the salary cap concerns. \nThat’s not an issue now because he is player with an expiring contract, and his pro-rated salary fits into the Blackhawks' salary matrix. \nMORE NHL:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T08:46:26.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
