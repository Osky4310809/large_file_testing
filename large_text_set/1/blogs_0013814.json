Probably not. But that’s the only not raw ingredient in this cake, sooo … that does count, right? I see raw vegan desserts being promoted as ‘healthy’ all the time. Compared to all traditional desserts — laden with dairy, eggs, oil, sugar, white flour, preservatives and chemical food colorings — they arguably are. But dessert is still dessert, and for me, that means it needs to be indulgent, moreish, and 1000% hit the spot. Cue the alcohol. Amaretto Chocolate Cream Cake [Vegan, Gluten-Free] This Recipe is : 2/3 cup dates, pitted and soaked for 2 hours 1 cup raw almonds, soaked overnight \nFor the filling: 3 cups cashews, soaked for 2 hours 1/2 cup raw cacao powder, or cacao nibs ground into powder 2/3 cup dates, pitted and soaked for 2 hours 1 cup minus about 1 tbsp warm water 3 tbsp Amaretto liqueur 3 tbsp coconut oil, melted Preparation Blend the dates and raw almonds in a food processor until they turn into a sticky ‘dough’. Press this into the bottom of a 8 inch springform cake tin. Refrigerate until needed. For the filling, prepare a date paste first: blend the dates with 2/3 cup of the water, the melted coconut oil and Amaretto into a smooth paste. Now add the rest of the water, the cashews and the cacao powder. Blend until smooth. Pour the filling into the cake tin, over the crust. Smooth over the top with a spatula, and refrigerate to set for at least 4 hours. Place in the freezer to speed up the process. Release from the tin and top with extra cacao nibs or chopped dates. Enjoy! Notes After soaking the dates and nuts, discard the soaking water. I use regular dates, but Medjool are always preferable; they’re also much, much stickier, so you may not even need to soak them. This cake freezes really well; simply slice it and keep it in an airtight tin for up to a month in the freezer. Leave to thaw for 10 minutes before eating, and it’s like an ice cream cake. You’re welcome.
