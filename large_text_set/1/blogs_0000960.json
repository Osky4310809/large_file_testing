We will serve Allah and we will die for him.”\nIn April 2014, the girls journeyed, by way of Turkey, to Syria where they were both believed to have married jihadists, according to Daily Mail.\nMirsad O., an Islamic pastor from Bosnia living in Vienna, known by his Islamic name “Ebu Tejma,” was reportedly responsible for recruiting the two girls. He has rejected the allegations. \nIn November, he was apprehended for his part in a suspected terrorist funding network based in Austria.\nJust after arriving in Syria, Selimovic, in a series of tweets with French magazine Paris Match said, “Here I can really be free. I can practice my religion. I couldn't do that in Vienna,” and that her husband was a soldier, reports the Express. Daily Mail reports the exchange as a text message interview.\nUp to 130 Austrians are thought to have joined ISIS as jihadists. Experts say more than half them were refugees from the Caucasus region of Russia and were given refugee status in Austria after the bloody Chechen war.\nAustrian Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Marakovits said:\n“If we can catch them before they leave we have the chance to work with their parents and other institutions to bring the youngsters out of the sphere of influence that prompted them to act in this way the first place. Once they have left the country, even if they then changed their minds, it is then almost impossible to get them back.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T09:02:54.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
