Karrueches lying. I've heard him beating her myself. I even called the police:\n— TheLucidDreamQueen (@KayCola) February 21, 2017 \n\nI used to cry over that situation hearing her screaming at the top of her lungs because i am also a victim of domestic violence\n— TheLucidDreamQueen (@KayCola) February 21, 2017 \nHoly shit! That sounds so scary!\nThe singer revealed she never spoke out about the abuse before because she \"didn't feel it was my place,\" but felt the need to defend Tran to those calling her a liar, writing:\nI never spoke up, cause I didn't feel it was my place but hearing y'all say she's lying I can't just sit by and watch this\n— TheLucidDreamQueen (@KayCola) February 21, 2017 \n\nI even got into it with Chris because his loud ass used 2 wake up my daughter. He was rude as fuck & I had known him since he was a kid\n— TheLucidDreamQueen (@KayCola) February 21, 2017 \n\nThe point is, stop defending these assholes and always blaming the woman. It's sad & sick, & is why women don't speak out\n— TheLucidDreamQueen (@KayCola) February 21, 2017 \n\nWomen literally get murdered by men who act like this and y'all thing it's cute or she just wants attention gtfoh\n— TheLucidDreamQueen (@KayCola) February 21, 2017 \nWell, she ain't wrong!\nRelated: Chris Gets Racist Over Aziz Ansari's Jokes \nKay concluded her Twitter testimony by telling Breezy's fans to encourage him to get help instead of enable his actions with unconditional support, adding:\nY'all wonder why celebs get away with so much, because of weirdos like u putting them on a pedestal letting them get away with this crap\n— TheLucidDreamQueen (@KayCola) February 21, 2017 \n\nIf you're really a Chris Brown fan u would want him to get help, not make excuses for everything he does. That's real love.\n— TheLucidDreamQueen (@KayCola) February 21, 2017 \nCola also explained a bit more why she kept quiet for so long:\npic.twitter.com/xAN5i3CP7S \n— TheLucidDreamQueen (@KayCola) February 21, 2017 \nWow. We're glad Chris' neighbor shed some light on the severity of the situation.\nOnly time will tell if the singer responds, but we have a feeling he won't be taking responsibility for his actions anytime soon.\nDo these new claims change YOUR feelings on the performer?\n[ Image via Instagram . ] \nTags: chris brown , karrueche tran , kay cola , legal matters , scary! , twitter , violence", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:41:20.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
