Alex Wong/Getty Images Members of Speaker Paul Ryan’s team, trying to appeal to Trump’s ego and deal-making sensibilities, have begun calling him the “closer” or the \"ultimate closer.” Advertisement \nA Trump associate had used a similar superlative in a conversation with Breitbart.com the week before: “The President gave Ryan a chance,” one source close to the President said. “If he doesn’t get his act together soon, the President will have no choice but to step in and fix this on his own. He’s the best negotiator on the planet, and if this were his bill not Ryan’s it would not be this much of a mess.” \nAnd here's a March 9 CNN article : \"He gets the complexity of this,\" a senior administration official said. \"It's a sell for him,\" the official said, adding that Trump sees himself as the ultimate deal maker and \"I think he's willing to cut deals,\" to get this legislation passed, the official said.

Eventually, though, we all pay the piper. \nBen Mathis-Lilley edits the Slatest. Follow @Slatest on Twitter .
