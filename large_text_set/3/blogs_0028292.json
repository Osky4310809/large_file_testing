The 11,000-square-foot main house has five bedrooms, aged oak floors, and tons of teak: “a teak library-like wine room,” a teak cigar room, and a 12-foot teak dining table. \nThe property also includes a 4,200-square-foot guest house, which has two bedrooms and its own kitchen, as well as an infinity pool that “cascades down two stories to the basement level of the home.” \nIf the house sells for even half of what it’s listed for, it stands to break a record in Malibu. The beach city’s most expensive sale on the market to date is held by 22314 Pacific Coast Highway, which Oracle cofounder and Malibu property collector Larry Ellison purchased for $36.9 million back in 2012. \nCash castle: Spec manse on former Castle Kashan site now asking $80M [TRD] 23800 Malibu Crest Drive [Coldwell Banker] Mapping 15 of Tech Billionaire Larry Ellison's Malibu Properties [Curbed LA] \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:39:47.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
