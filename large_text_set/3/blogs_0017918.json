When asked if EPA regulations had prevented jobs from being created, Burke claimed the exact opposite had occurred. \n“The EPA does not stifle jobs,” Burke said. “Just look at the economic recovery. The Obama administration in the last eight years was devastating for jobs? Not true. There’s been a tremendous recovery. Some of the most booming industries in the world are related to the environment in the renewable energy sector.” \nThe number of jobs killed by EPA regulations is difficult to track, but a 2012 report by National Economic Research Associates estimated the agency has caused 887,000 job losses across the economy annually . A U.S. district court ruled in October that EPA had not adequately analyzed how many job its regulations killed. \nTrump recommended that Congress slash the EPA’s budget by 31 percent . If Congress approves of the cuts, EPA will see its budget cut from $8.2 billion to $5.7 billion, the lowest funding levels in 40 years — adjusted for inflation. EPA’s 15,000-strong workforce could be cut to 12,000 employees. \nHe pledged during his campaign to get rid of the agency “in almost every form,” leaving only “little tidbits left.” \n“I am very concerned about people in junior positions, postdocs, and leaders of the future,” Burke continued. “I’m very concerned about the brain drain. It will be tremendously difficult to rebuild. It took a long time to rebuild agencies after Reagan’s cutbacks.” \nEPA employees have reportedly arrived at work in tears because of Trump. An anonymous EPA communications career employee told Pro-Publica that “more than a few friends were ‘coming to work in tears’ each morning as they grappled with balancing the practical need to keep their jobs with their concerns for the issues they work on.” \nThe Trump administration allegedly instructed the EPA to freeze all grants for projects, research on global warming, air quality monitoring and education, and instructed employees not to discuss the spending freeze outside the agency, according to reports earlier this week . \nThe president also allegedly ordered the EPA to take down its global warming webpage , however, it is currently still up . The page contains some links to EPA’s data on carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as other greenhouse gas emissions and lists the effects the agency says global warming will have. The site doesn’t host much of the data, however, and only aggregates links to it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:10:49.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
