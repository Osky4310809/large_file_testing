Load More Hello and welcome to our live blog for the historic one-off Test match to be played between India and Bangladesh. The match will be played at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad on Thursday and the match is scheduled to start at 9:30 am IST. The one-off Test starts following India’s 4-0 win against the visiting England in the five-match Test series and then following it up by clinching the ODI and T20I series as well against the same side. India led by Virat Kohli is positive about their chances in this Test match and not taking Bangladesh lightly. However, cautioning his No.1-ranked team against any complacency while playing in Tests against Bangladesh, Kohli said the Tigers have the required skills to be successful in the five-day format as well.

Their famous and biggest victory in Test came when they defeated England at their den. However, Bangladesh last played a two-match test series in New Zealand, in which they were whitewashed by the Black caps. All the eyes will be on spinners as, if Indian spinners can wreak havoc in the sub continent, Bangladesh also have their armour in place. For example, Mehedi Hasan Miraz, as last year, he took 22 wickets to be named Man of the Series that Bangladesh played against England, with his best of 12 wickets coming in the second Test in Dhaka which Bangladesh won by 108 runs to level the series. If India have R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja at their disposal, Bangladesh have the trio of Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Shakib Al Hasan and Taijul Islam. Senior most Shakib Al Hasan has 165 Test wickets under his belt in 46 wickets while Islam also has taken 43 wickets in only 11 Tests.
