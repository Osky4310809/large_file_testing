What comes to mind? Four walls, square windows, a rectangular door? Changes are there’s a lot of right angles.\nBut one look at a home built by LA-based Binishells is all it takes to realize that this construction company is doing things differently — and thinking outside the box.\nBinishells president and CEO Nicolò Bini is continuing the work of his father, who developed the technology for these domed buildings back in the 1960s. It’s something Bini refers to as “building 2.0” — a cleaner, safer, less wasteful and more cost-efficient way of doing construction.\nIt doesn’t hurt that it looks really cool, too.\n“In the last 150 years, construction has not evolved,” says Bini. “Most other industries — even smaller and certainly less impactful — have reinvented themselves in infinite number of ways.”\nBinishells is part of a community of socially-minded innovators and entrepreneurs who make up the LA Cleantech Incubator (LACI) and are committed to finding clean tech solutions for California and beyond.\nWatch the video above to learn how the technology works and discover why Binishells is determined to revolutionize the construction business.", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/u6ZQYU64.jpg", "http://www.binishells.com/", "http://laincubator.org/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/u6ZQYU64.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-22T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:59:01.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
