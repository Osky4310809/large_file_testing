Advertisement More by this Author \nThe fall of a Mugumo tree in Nyeri has caused anxiety while triggering speculations on its meaning. \nSome residents in Kiamigwi, Mathira constituency where the tree fell have associated the incident with the death of the late governor Nderitu Gachagua who was buried earlier this month. \nMr Charles Gikandi, a resident, said falling of the revered tree symbolised the end of Mr Gachagua’s reign and the beginning of another. \n“It shows that the position the late Gachagua held in the county has come to an end. We must prepare ourselves for changes,” he said. \nThe late had served as the area’s MP before being elected governor earning him the respect of a ruler. \nAnd with the General Election around the corner, Mr Gikandi said that it also meant that those who have held leadership positions for a long time will be kicked out and the youth will succeed them. \nBut some residents dismissed these arguments as false noting that only the Kikuyu elders could give the true interpretation once they have inspected the scene. \nThe tree, said to be about 100 years old, considered sacred, fell on Saturday night sparking debate among the locals. \nElders occasionally held prayers at the foot of the tree and offered sacrifices while facing Mount Kenya. \nMr Simon Kariuki told the Nation that God was a sending message to his people to turn away from immorality. \n“For such a tree to fall it means that our Maker is not pleased with something we have done,” he said. \nResidents who visited the scene immediately the tree fell said they spotted snakes emerging from the hollow sections. \n“We spotted at least three snakes slithering around the tree. One was killed but the others disappeared,” said Ms Alice Wanjiku. \nElderly men however warned women against speaking about the tree or idling around the area. \nKikuyu elders will have to conduct rituals around the tree as part of tradition. \nCurious residents have been trooping the scene since Sunday. \nThe famous tree tumbled in the homestead of Mr Maurice Gachamba famous for assembling an aircraft he named Kenya One.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:43:14.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
