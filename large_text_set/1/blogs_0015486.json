Rapper Nick Cannon said that what Planned Parenthood does to the black community is “genocide.” According to The Blaze : \nCannon’s comments came during an interview with New York City’s “The Breakfast Club” radio host Charlamagne Tha God Thursday, when cohost Angela Yee brought up President-elect Donald Trump’s rejection of late-term abortion and his past proposal to reverse the landmark Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade: \nHillary was, think about all of the things they did with Planned Parenthood and all of that type of stuff. That type of stuff is to take our community, and forget gentrification, it’s real genocide, and it’s been like that for years. This system is not built for us. This is not our land. I appreciate it, I love it, wouldn’t want to live anywhere else, but this wasn’t designed for our people. \nThe report shows that in 2013, New York City reported 69,840 abortions and 116,777 registered births, which means that the city’s abortion rate is 60 percent of its birth rate. \nThis is a TRAVESTY. \nWhen Cannon was asked why he was speaking out about this, he said that the Christian values of his community inspired him to be honest even if it’s not popular. \n“I come from a long line of community leaders and I’ve always thought that to who much is given, you’re responsible for that, much is required,” he said, referring to Luke 12:48 . “So I use my platform to tell the truth at the end of the day.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:08:10.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
