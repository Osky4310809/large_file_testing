Not only did he plan a huge surprise party, he planned a ‘surprise’ trip to Mexico with some of my closest friends, too. Thanks, babe….you will probably never see this,” Cavallari gushed on social media.\nCutler, 33, missed 11 games this past season with finger and shoulder injuries. And it is expected to be his last in Chicago, with the Bears likely to release him with $16 million owed to him next season.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:35:13.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
