It’s my editorial judgement that use of the word lie has not been necessary to fully communicate the facts of the situation so far. That’s my judgement as a journalist and my decision as editorial director. Our job is to report and present the facts. That’s what gives our audiences the information they need to be good citizens. They are as capable as we are of judging the meaning of those facts. Many have concluded that those facts mean the president has lied. They seem to be the ones pressing for us to use the word. But if they’ve reached that judgement why do they need us to say it for them?” \nThere were also reports last week that the Trump transition team was mulling a budget plan that would privatize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR stations. An NPR spokeswoman said that “funding has absolutely nothing to do with the editorial decision-making process in the NPR newsroom.” \nClarification: Mary Louise Kelly quote was corrected to read that the claim was “provably not true,” not “probably not true.” Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T02:19:29.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
