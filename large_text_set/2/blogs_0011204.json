We are talking about a genius of football. \n\"Cesc doesn't run 100 metres in 10 seconds, but I can allow him this because he's a genius with the ball. His velocity is in his mind. With Cesc we are working on tactical aspects and to improve his position.\" \nConte went on to explain how he loses sleep over how to include players like, Fabregas, Willian and Pedro in his starting line up, with competition for places high at the league-leading team. \nMourinho takes aim at 'very defensive' Chelsea \n“Sometimes you must make the decision and look at the balance of the team,\" he added. \"Sometimes you must make different decisions. Cesc is an important player and I always try to put him in the best condition to give us his best for the team. \n\"I'm very pleased with him. Don't forget N'Golo Kante is playing in his place and a lot of people say that he is the best player in the league. Then there is Nemanja Matic, who I think is playing in an outstanding way. \n\"When you have two players playing so well it's not easy. It's the same for Willian and Pedro. For me, sometimes it's difficult to sleep and to make the best decision. I prefer to have this type of problem. \n\"The most important thing is these players are totally involved in the team. Cesc is playing with us and is very important for the team and I’m pleased about this.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:32:56.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
