The answer is that I had planned on running for president. And although it would have been a very difficult primary, I think I could have won.\" \nThings certainly would have played out much differently, that's for sure! \nRelated: Joe Says He'll Run For President In 2020! \nBiden also revealed that his son Beau 's battle with brain cancer kept him out of the race, adding that his son wanted him to try and become Barack Obama 's successor. \nThough the 74-year-old knew he wasn't mentally up for the game at the time — he said any presidential candidate should be able to \"look the public in the eye and promise you they can give you 100 percent\" — Biden confessed he regrets not giving it a shot, adding: \n\"Do I regret not being president? Yes.\" \nYup, we're regretting that too right about now, Joe! \nAs for who actually won, Biden hopes President Trump \"grows into the job a little bit.\" Now he's just talking crazy! \nDo YOU think Biden would have won had he run for President?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:53:44.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
