I think it's the kind of conduct and activity we'll see going forward.\" \nHe said Eastern Europe had only recently become independent from Moscow, but Russian influence is growing. \n\"It looks to me like that's changing fairly dramatically as I watch Mr. Putin operate in the Soviet Union,\" Cheney said. \"He believed that the end of the Cold War and the Soviet Union was a disaster and I think he has aspirations to correct that.\" \nCheney said he believes Putin wants to bring the Baltic states of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia back into the Russian fold. Those states are all a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Putin's cyber interference is also prominent in those countries, Cheney said. \nHe says Putin's interference in the Middle East is also troubling. \n\"He's now back in a very significant way in Syria and Iran, operating in ways that nobody, none of his predecessors have done in the last 40 years,\" he said.
