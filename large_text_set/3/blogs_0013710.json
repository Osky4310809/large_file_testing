Madrid currently lead their Catalan rivals by two points but have a game in hand. \nIf neither side slips up in their next three league outings, a victory for Zinedine Zidane's men in the second Clasico of the season would see them open up a five-point gap that would look a very healthy cushion as the season reaches its climax. On the contrary, if Barcelona were to win, they would put the pressure on their great rivals by claiming the top spot. \nMadrid will have a slight advantage before the match, as they will be afforded one day of rest more than their opponents. It is a Champions League week, and on the previous Tuesday Zidane's men tackle Bayern Munich at home in the second leg of their quarter-final tie. Meanwhile, Barcelona do not play Juventus at Camp Nou until 24 hours later. \nWhen the clubs met earlier this season, the match finished 1-1 at Camp Nou. Luis Suarez's 53rd-minute goal appeared to have given Barca the victory, but Madrid captain Sergio Ramos levelled matters in stoppage time to secure a share of the spoils. As La Liga's first deciding factor when teams are tied on points is their head-to-head record, a victory in April's derby clash would be all the more precious to either side. \nThis will be the 233rd competitive meeting of the two great institutions, with Madrid marginally ahead on the head-to-head record, with 93 wins to Barcelona's 90, while 49 games have ended all square.
