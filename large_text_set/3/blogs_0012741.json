I don’t want to go into details on that but you just follow the path that is in front of you. Whatever type of situation, I just try to deliver. \n“But as a team you want to be the best. I want my team to be the best. At the end of the day, the big aim in football is to win as many titles as you can, so we need to try more, give a bit more. \n“Everton as a football club has a great history. But the future has to be written. You get me? Because we always talk about the teams of the 80s and 70s and if you look it was great. But we as players we want the fans talking about us instead of us talking about them.” \nEverton splashed out on Morgan Schneiderlin and Yannick Bolasie earlier this season, but Lukaku believes there needs to be a bigger influx of top players. \n“Instead of living in the past, you have to think ahead,” he added. \n“How this club has to grow, how this club has to improve, which player does it want to bring in so you can challenge for the big trophies. \n“Then like sometimes I will speak to Vincent Kompany who was at (Manchester) City when it all happened. \n“He said, ‘Rom, one summer I just came in and boom, boom, boom, boom… Robinho from there, that guy came in, this guy came in, this guy came in. \n“They had league titles, FA Cup, League Cups. That is what we want as players.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T12:31:22.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
