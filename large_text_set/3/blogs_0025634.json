(Photo: Michael Regan - The FA) Share Get     \nIt's here! It's finally here! \nYour diary has been clear for weeks, you've told your mum you don't have time to see her today (and that her card and present are \"in the post\", which translates as you totally forgot it's Mother's Day) and you're ready to go. \nYep, the game that everyone has been waiting for, the clash the entire football season up until now has been building up to, is right around the corner. \nLadies and gents, we're delighted to say that England vs Lithuania in a World Cup qualifier is upon us. \nAhem. \nOK, so England fans are more likely to see this as the last international hurdle before the Premier League run-in can resume at the weekend. We get that. \nEven so, we've still taken a peek into the Row Zed crystal ball to see what's likely to go down at Wembley - just so you're fully prepared. 1) Bradley Lowery will get the biggest cheer of the night Thumbs up for a legend (Photo: PA) \nAnd rightly so. The incredibly brave Bradley is leading the team out with \"best mate\" Jermain Defoe and Wembley will go crazy for him. 2) People will obsess over the formation \"The number of claps correlates to the number of defenders I want back!\" (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n\"Well of course, England did deploy three at the back against Germany in midweek... it looks as if injuries could mean a return to the traditional four... or maybe he'll go with three... or two with loads of defensive midfielders and wing backs... SCREW IT, THEY SHOULD JUST PLAY 10 UP FRONT!\" 3) A commentator will mention that \"We're still early on in the Gareth Southgate era\" \"Still early, is it?\" (Photo: Mike Hewitt) \nYes, we know. No need to remind us, thanks. 4) Lithuania will take the lead \"Are they Iceland in disguise?\" (Photo: PA) \nWell, this is England we're talking about here - so don't rule it out. 5) Jermain Defoe will score Defoe = England goal machine? (Photo: Stu Forster) \nTipped to start the game , Defoe will have maximum chance to get on the scoresheet. And after all, that's what he's there for. \nBonus points if the pundits start talking about what he has to do to make the 2018 World Cup squad. 6) Twitter will start getting VERY annoyed at the England band You can hear the music in your head already, can't you? (Photo: Richard Heathcote - The FA) \nProbably coming straight after Defoe's equaliser will be the social media outcry that some fans are trying to start an atmosphere at the national stadium. \nCue \"I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WATCH THIS ON MUTE IF THEY DON'T SHUT UP!\" alongside a GIF of someone holding their ears and crying. 7) There'll be talk of building the next generation around Michael Keane and Dele Alli The two who'll lead England to World Cup glory... maybe (Photo: Getty Images) \n\"They're the future for me, England HAVE to build the next team around them, otherwise we might as well pack up the sport altogether if you ask me, Clive.\" 8) The captaincy debate will crop up \"Oi! Dele! You fancy it?\" (Photo: Lars Baron) \nWith Wayne Rooney absent and Joe Hart skippering the team, this is inevitable. \n\"Are we looking at a future permanent England captain here?\" will be asked about Hart, and probably Dele Alli and Michael Keane as well just for the sake of it. 9) England will end up absolutely battering them 2-1... Hooray, another memorable England win! (Photo: Michael Regan - The FA) \n...and everyone will say we're going to win the World Cup. Standard.
