We have a lot of killers,” Trump said. “Well, you think our country is so innocent?” \nTrump added that he thinks the United States is “better” getting along with Russia than not. \n“If Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all around the world, major fight. That’s a good thing,” Trump said. ISIS is another name for the Islamic State. \nIt wouldn’t be the first time Trump has brushed aside the topic of Putin’s political killings. \nIn a 2015 interview on “Morning Joe,” Trump was pressed on the same issue and gave a similar answer. \n“He kills journalists that don’t agree with him,” the show’s host, Joe Scarborough, pointed out. \n“Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe,” Trump said. \nAs recently as this week, a prominent Putin critic exhibited symptoms of poisoning for the second time since 2015. The incident drew the attention of Republican Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), a staunch Russia critic, who tweeted two newspaper editorials that call for the United States to denounce the incident as an act of political retribution. He called both editorials “a must-read.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:30:13.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
