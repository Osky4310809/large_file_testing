I remember when we launched Darker Image , Bloodwulf appeared for the fist time in a million comics. People love Darker Image and then we never followed it up. That was a kick ass book with three medium sized stories. So I've wanted to revisit that. Certainly Bloodwulf will be in this Extreme Anthology.\" \nBloodwulf, who appeared in about two dozen comics, mostly in the '90s, has often been compared to DC's badass interstellar bounty hunter Lobo, who will be taking up residence this spring in Justice League America . Depending on the nature and scope of the planned cinematic universe Fundamental is developing with the Extreme characters, it may be one of the more difficult properties to \"fit in\" to the movies. \nExtreme Studios was one of the original studios that came together (along with Erik Larsen's Highbrow, Todd McFarlane Productions, Jim Lee's WildStorm, and more) to form Image. Later, Liefeld would leave Image for a time after a falling out with the other partners. He would periodically work with them, but would publish his creator-owned characters through a number of publishers over the years. He didn't return full time to Extreme Studios and Image Comics until 2011, after which Brandon Graham's Prophet launched, marking the most acclaimed launch on Liefeld's watch since the days when Watchmen scribe Alan Moore was working with him. \nAll along, he's continued to publish certain, fan-favorite characters from the Extreme era, most notably Youngblood , on which Liefeld once took a chance on a young up-and-comer named Robert Kirkman (now an Image partner). \nNo word on when the Extreme Anthology might come out; expect to hear more in the near future as the publisher has already started rolling out twenty-fifth anniversary variants, 25-cent comics , and the like.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:22:10.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
