Ayodele Fayose \nFayose called other governors to ensure the autonomy that will enable the people at the grassroots enjoy real governance. \nThis was just as the Governor pardoned a local government staff and Deputy President of the Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees in Ekiti State, Comrade O.B. Olatunde, who was dismissed from service for alleged rudeness to the governor over salary crisis. \nFayose said the state would commute to suspension, the outright dismissal slammed on the victim by a committee set up by the Head of Service, Dr. Olugbenga Faseluka, to try the local government staff for allegedly casting aspersion on the person of the governor during a meeting held to resolve some salary issues. \nThe affected LG staff was alleged to have rudely addressed the governor when a directive was given on how certain money should be disbursed as recommended by the State Joint Allocation Committee. \nFayose gave the indication after meeting with the NULGE’s reconciliatory delegation led by its National President, Comrade Ibrahim Khaleel in Ado Ekiti to appeal to the governor to rescind his \npronouncement on the erring staff. \nFayose, while briefing the delegation said: “There should be a government the people at the grassroots can refer to as their own.” \nKhaleel, who described Fayose as the Voice of the voiceless, said: “I decided to honour Governor Fayose because I saw him as part of this fold. He is a comrade governor because he represents the voice of the voiceless in Nigeria.’’ \nPetrol dealers declare indefinite strike \nMeantime, members of the Petrol Dealers Association of Nigeria, PEDAN, in Ekiti state yesterday embarked on indefinite strike to protest government’s policy on revocation of certificates of occupancy (Cs of O) granted to members. \nThe group accused Governor Fayose’s of inciting the public against them during his monthly programme on the state radio and television stations, tagged ‘Meet your governor’. \nThey also expressed concern over the ban placed on the construction of filling stations in residential areas, even by those that had got the approval for such project. \nBlack marketers cashed in on the strike action embarked upon by the petrol dealers to make quick profit, as some of them were seen around the major streets of Ado-Ekiti hawking jerry-cans filled with petroleum products", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:18:26.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
