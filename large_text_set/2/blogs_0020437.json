Photo: Verizon \nThe next generation of wireless internet speed is nearly here. But only if you have a Verizon account. \nThe carrier said today that it plans to start rolling out its high-speed wireless 5G network in the United States during the first half of 2017, making it the first cellular network to offer the new technology. \nVerizon’s new 5G network won’t be available everywhere right out of the gate, though. The company said only certain customers in 11 cities will be able to use the 5G network. \nUnfortunately, you won’t be getting those crazy-fast speeds on your iPhone just yet even if you do live in one of the lucky areas. Verizon’s 5G network is meant as a replacement for home or office broadband, so you no longer need to rely on old, worn-out cables. \n“The 5G systems we are deploying will soon provide wireless broadband service to homes, enabling customers to experience cost-competitive gigabit speeds that were previously only deliverable via fiber,” said Woojune Kim , vice president of the Samsung team in charge of 5G and a partner for the Verizon deployment. Cities that will get the new 5G speeds includes Atlanta; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Bernardsville, New Jersey; Dallas; Denver; Houston; Miami; Sacramento; Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The new technology promises to bring speeds that are 10 to 100 times faster than current cellular data capabilities. \nGetting access to the 5G network will be a bit tricky during 2017. Verizon says its network will cover thousands of homes and businesses, but the company hasn’t revealed how it will pick an individual to become a “pilot customer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:54:17.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
