In hindsight, she says, the performance should have been canceled and rescheduled. \nHill says the promoter used social media to notify fans that the show would start late. But the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that many fans left and demanded refunds. \nHill says she hopes to schedule another Pittsburgh performance for those fans later this month.
