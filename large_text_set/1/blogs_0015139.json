John Lewis (D-GA) claimed this Friday will be the first time he has skipped an inauguration. Rep John Lewis on #MTP : \"I don't plan to attend the inauguration..first one that I miss since I've been in Congress\" https://t.co/4wRHSuFtmM — Alex Moe (@AlexNBCNews) January 13, 2017 \nAs it turns out, this isn't true: Lewis did not attend George W. Bush's inauguration in 2001 and instead spent the day in Atlanta. \n(His staff now claims that they \"forgot\" about that.) John Lewis's staff says he forgot that he boycotted George W.

He boycotted Bush 43 also because he... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2017 \"thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.\" Sound familiar! WP — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2017 \nIn addition to Lewis, more than 40 of his colleagues will also be boycotting the inauguration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T05:39:33.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
