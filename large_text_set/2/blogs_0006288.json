In 2015, there were 162 homicides, representing a 54 percent increase from the year before. That total figure declined in 2016 to 135, but it’s still higher than usual. \nGray said he was disappointed at the vote result and said he’ll return with different legislation to increase the size of the police force, which is desperately needed. \nCouncil member Charles Allen’s views on the emergency legislation ended up holding the day. \n“I agree that we have a need to stabilize our police force. Attrition needs to be taken seriously,” Allen said . “I’m not sure passing it on emergency is the right way to go. We need a comprehensive solution. And we need to make sure we have both the size and type of force that works best for the District.” \nThe city maintains that 4,200 police officers are needed to keep the area safe and secure. But at the end of 2015, the department had only 3,800 officers. \nFormer Police Chief Cathy Lanier said the Metropolitan Police Department hasn’t been able to hire enough officers to make up for all the others retiring or dropping out of the force. \nDuring the vote, 200 protesters gathered outside to advocate against the idea of adding more police officers. \n“What we’re saying is that there are other ways to actually promote public safety, like violence interruption, that have big results but also don’t involve the divisive tactics of the police, the racial profiling,” Eugene Puryear, with Stop Police Terror Project, told NBC Washington . \nFollow Jonah Bennett on Twitter \nSend tips to .
