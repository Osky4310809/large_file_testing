She really believes he'll go after her. \n“It’s disgusting I think because he’s a real perpetrator, he’s a very evil man.” Read More Violent paedophile went on X Factor while police hunted him for raping 10-year-old girl \nIn their ruling Court of Appeal President Justice Chris Maxwell, Justice Robert Redlich and Justice David Beach acknowledged the crimes but agreed with the Supreme Court decision. \nThe ruling stated: \"The criminal justice system imposes punishment on sex offenders and, in the ordinary course, an offender who has served his/her sentence is entitled to be released.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:09:10.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
