Both were controversial projects in the Obama administration due to their environmental impact.Trump signed another action addressing the \"tangled-up mess\" of permitting, promising to \"streamline\" the process.Another action will expedite environmental reviews for businesses, Trump said. \nIn keeping with his focus on \"America First\" policies, Trump mandated that U.S. pipelines be built with U.S. steel. \n\"If we build it in the United States, build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe,\" Trump said. \"It's going to put a lot of workers, a lot of steelworkers back to work.\" \nThe five actions came on the heels of Trump's decision one day earlier to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that had become politically toxic amid opposition from both parties. \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

At the same time, he has concentrated on executive actions that will stall the implementation of Obama-era policies, such as a regualtory freeze for all federal agencies and a suspension of hiring at most federal agencies. \nRepublicans met Trump's executive actions on Tuesday with praise. \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said of the renewed construction plans for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines: \"It's about time.\" \nMost of Trump's actions on Tuesday came in the form of memoranda to federal agencies. \nFor example, he instructed his secretary of commerce, who has not yet been confirmed, to \"develop a plan\" that would require new, updated or expanded pipeline projects to use American steel and equipment \"to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law.\" Also from the Washington Examiner", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:03:23.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
