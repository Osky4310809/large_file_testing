By Kit Fox Thursday, March 2, 2017, 4:10 pm Michael Reaves/Getty Images \nAnxious runners from around the world huddled near their phones and computers Thursday to find out if they’d been selected to run the 2017 New York City Marathon , which will take place on November 5. \nThis year, the world’s largest 26.2 received the largest number of registration applicants in its 47-year history. Here’s how the entry drawing breaks down, according to a press release from the New York Road Runners (NYRR): Advertisement \nQuote of the Day, motivation, and inspiration — every morning rundown \nAdvice on training, nutrition, shoes, and more — every evening Keep this field blank \n98,247: The total number of runners who applied for the free, non-guaranteed drawing. NYRR stopped charging to enter the drawing this year after settling a lawsuit last fall against the former lottery selection process. \n20 percent: The increase in applicants to the drawing compared to 2016. \n16,211: The number of runners who will get a bib via the non-guaranteed drawing, which equates to a 17 percent acceptance rate—roughly the same acceptance rate as Georgetown University and UCLA. \n50,000: The estimated total size of the 2017 marathon field. Which means 34,000 runners will gain entry through a number of guaranteed methods . Those include achieving a qualifying time at a sanctioned race, running for charity, or completing the NYRR 9+1 program (finishing 9 NYRR races and volunteering at one within a year). \n9,000: The number of charity slots allotted in the 2016 race. Those runners combined to raise $36.1 million dollars. \nRunners who are not accepted via the non-guaranteed drawing are eligible to apply for a charity bib starting today. Meanwhile, both those accepted and denied are expressing their excitement and sadness on social media. Here are some of the best reactions: Over here waiting for my email about the @nycmarathon drawing like: pic.twitter.com/iJGjWK22QO \n— Dale Marie (@Dale_Erdmier) March 2, 2017 OMG. OMG. OMG.
