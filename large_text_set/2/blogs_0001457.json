Wearing only a bra and underwear, she cradles her growing belly in her hands. ( See it here !) \n“We would like to share our love and happiness,” reads the stunning photo’s caption. “We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. – The Carters.” \nThe babies on the way will be #2 and 3 for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, who are already parents to 5-year-old daughter Blue Ivy . \nJudging from today’s dramatic pregnancy pic, Beyoncé and Jay-Z managed to keep their happy news under wraps for quite some time. \nThis isn’t the first time the pair, who have been married for 8 years, have pulled off such a huge surprise. The ‘Halo’ singer memorably revealed her pregnancy with Blue Ivy when she showed up on the MTV VMA red carpet with a very noticeable bump back in 2011. \nOne thing that Beyoncé hasn’t kept secret is her desire for another child. Not long after Blue Ivy’s arrival, the new mom revealed, “I would like more children. I think my daughter needs some company … at some point, when it’s supposed to happen.” \nCongratulations (times two) to Beyoncé and Jay-Z! \nBeyoncé and other famous moms reveal what childbirth was really like… \nPhotos: REX USA, PR Photos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:59:20.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
