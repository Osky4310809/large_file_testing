Football becomes your life. Every manager will tell you that. \n\"You have to be fit, of course. I run every day. I still play football. If you [the media] have a game at the end of the season, I will play. And, if you play full-back, I still think I can still be a winger against you! \n“What I can say, yes, it’s very demanding. It’s a sacrifice of your life. You have nothing else happening in your life.

But it is as well a fantastic opportunity in life to go for what is really great in human beings, to get yourself to the next level always, to improve, to invent yourself, to push your limits further up.” \nWenger knows the next few weeks will go a long way to shaping his future. \nDefeat at Liverpool on Saturday could see them slip out of the top four, and a seventh successive Champions League last-16 exit looks inevitable when they entertain Bayern Munich on Tuesday. \nMirrorSport understands Wenger is still undecided on his future but there is a growing belief he will go if Arsenal fail to turn their season around and miss out on Champions League qualification for the first time since his initial season in charge. \nThe one saving grace may be the lack of an obvious replacement.

That’s basically it.” \nWenger also did not deny the Mirror's story that he had turned down a £30m-a-year offer from China, but added: “This press conference is about the game at Liverpool, not my future and what I turned down or not down.” poll loading Will this be Wenger's final season as Arsenal boss? 10000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:55:37.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
