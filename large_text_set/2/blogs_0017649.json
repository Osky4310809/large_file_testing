Picture: Gregg Porteous \nIn other cheapie news over the last week: \n* KALYN Ponga is one step closer to a round one spot following news Antonio Winterstein (ankle) will miss the first two rounds. Ponga is fighting for the wing spot with Javid Bowen and Gideon Gela-Mosby; \n* SIOSIFA Talaki all but locked down a South Sydney centre spot with a powerful display in the Charity Shield, including a try and plenty of damaging carries; \n* TEAMMATE Braydon Burns also had a blinder with a two-try display. However, he is likely to lose his spot for round one, with Greg Inglis to return at fullback and Alex Johnston shifting to Burns’ wing; \n* DYLAN Phythian is confirmed to play fullback for the Knights following a strong trial display. He scored a try and showed plenty with the football, albeit against a very weak Canberra outfit; \n* MELBOURNE young gun Curtis Scott conceded two tries down his side in his first stint, but later turned the tables with a try of his own in his second stint. He remains favourite for the left centre spot at Melbourne; \n* FRANK Winterstein scored a try in Manly’s trial, further pushing his claims for a starting edge back row role; \n* DEAN Whare scored a try and appears certain to take the wing spot of Dallin Watene-Zelezniak (foot, round three) for at least the first fortnight; \n* TIGERS young gun Moses Suli, who has been signed to a massive $1.2m contract despite playing just two Holden Cup games, had an enormous trial on the wing. He is gunning for the left wing spot created by the disciplinary suspension of Tim Simona (indefinite). Suli faces competition from Justin Hunt and Jordan Rankin; \n* JAI Field all but bowed out of contention for the Dragons’ halfback spot following a quiet performance in the Charity Shield; \n* WESTS Tigers coach Jason Taylor confirmed Matt Ballin (ACL) should be right for round one, but minutes are a massive worry after a two-year lay-off; \n* JESSE Ramien and Kurt Capewell had mixed games for Cronulla in the World Club Challenge. Ramien scored a try and Capewell had a try disallowed by the video referee. However, both made crucial errors, and they may lose their spots for round one, with Valentine Holmes (hamstring) and Sosaia Feki (knee) racing the clock; \n* NICK Cotric was one of Canberra’s most likely in a weak team that was totally dominated by the Knights. However, veteran UK import Jordan Turner remains favourite to win the left centre spot of Jarrod Croker (knee, round five). media_camera Kalyn Ponga scored a hattrick in the weekend trial. \nBURNED CHEAPIES \n* Brian Kelly, Shaun Lane, Cameron King, Liam Knight, Tyrrell Fuimaono, Shaun Nona, Gideon Gela-Mosby, Eddy Pettybourne, Jed Cartwright (not named for final trials and therefore set to miss round one) \n* Matt Dufty, Nat Butcher (injured) \n* Joe Stimson, Patrick Kaufusi, Robert Jennings, Marcelo Montoya, Brad Abbey, Dylan Edwards (named on extended benches for final trials and therefore set to miss round one) \n* Ata Hingano (won’t notch three games due to Kieran Foran clearance) \n* Jai Field (only an outside chance for round one team) \nLAST RESORT CHEAPIES \n* Matt Ballin - tipped to return from injury in round one, but minutes are an issue \n* The following fringe forwards are likely to score top 17 spots for round one, but minutes are a massive concern - Moses Leota (Panthers), John Asiata, Sam Hoare (Cowboys), Clay Priest (Raiders), JJ Felise (Tigers), Danny Fualalo, Francis Tualau (Bulldogs), Paterika Vaivai (Titans), Luke Yates (Knights), Jarrad Kennedy (Sea Eagles). \nGENUINE CHEAPIE OPTIONS \n* Jayden Brailey - set to start at hooker for the Sharks \n* Curtis Scott - favourite for left centre spot at Melbourne over Cheyse Blair \n* Siosifa Talaki - appears to have won a South Sydney centre spot \n* Frank Winterstein - set for starting wide back row spot at Sea Eagles. Unfortunately starts just above bottom dollar at $172,900 \n* Akuila Uate - has a wing spot wrapped up at Sea Eagles, but was poor in the All Stars \n* Dylan Phythian - all but confirmed to start at fullback for the Knights. Attacking stats an issue at Newcastle \n* Brock Lamb - confirmed to play five-eighth in place of the banned Jarrod Mullen. Ditto re attacking stats and starts at $176,000 \nFINGERS CROSSED \n* Moses Suli - smokey for Tigers’ left wing spot \n* Kalyn Ponga - one step closer to round one spot following injury to Antonio Winterstein \n* Nick Cotric – with Jarrod Croker (knee, round four) injured, Cotric is vying for the Canberra left centre spot with UK import Jordan Turner \n* Dean Whare – set to play on the Penrith wing for the opening fortnight with Dallin Watene-Zelezniak (foot) due back in round three \n* Jesse Ramien and Kurt Capewell – played on wing in World Club Challenge, but could lose spots for round one with Valentine Holmes and Sosaia Feki aiming to return \n* Braydon Burns – brilliant in Charity Shield, but expect him to drop out when Greg Inglis (rested) returns", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:02:50.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
