(ANI) \nA day after the Censor Board of Certification (CBFC) refused to certify award winning film ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’, its CEO Anurag Srivastava said that there was no controversy over the issue. Pointing out that the board followed normal process, he said that the makers of the film can go to tribunal on the issue. \nEarlier in the days CBFC director Pahlaj Nihalini evaded media questions on why the board refused to certify the film. When a reporter told Nihalani that his decision maybe misogynistic, he almost lost his temper, saying, “Don’t force me.” \n“I am going to CBFC, this is my personal office. I will do it there. Don’t force me,” he can been seen as saying in an ANI video. He was being bombarded with questions on the recent decision of denying certificate to the film, which has been critically acclaimed in international festivals. \nThe film stars Konkona Sen Sharma, Ratna Pathak Shah and others and is produced by Prakash Jha. News18 reported Nihalani as saying about the movie, “The story is lady oriented, their fantasy above life. There are contanious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society, hence film was refused under guidelines.(sic)” \nA member of CBFC, Ashok Pandit also questioned the move, said, ““I am myself quite shocked to see these kind of words have been used in the letter. Tragedy is that a filmmaker like Prakash Jha, who has won so many award, his intelligence is being questioned. This film is not going to create riots in any case.” \nYou may also like to watch this video \nBollywood director, Shyam Benegal told News 18 channel, “There was a committee that the government had set to look into the way certification is done. Films need to be classified not censored. There’s no question of censoring. We are talking of classification according to suitability of age and maturity. No idea if the said the suggestions have been implemented by CBFC.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T14:06:50.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
