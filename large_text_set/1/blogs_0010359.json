Trump, will become the 45th president of the United States,” Baldwin’s Trump said. “And then, two months later, Mike Pence will become the 46th.” \nTrump certainly gave SNL a lot of material to work with. During his bizarre press conference earlier in the week, he enlisted paid staffers to applaud his answers , attacked a CNN reporter and called his network’s coverage “fake news” and covered a table with prop folders he claimed were filled with important business documents. \nBut it was a salacious detail in an unverified 35-page dossier about an alleged compromising videotape that SNL chose to highlight first and often. \nBaldwin’s Trump refused to answer any questions about the videotape, because “it didn’t happen, and it wasn’t as cool as it sounded.” \nPresident-elect Donald Trump only wants to talk about what is really important in this country. #SNL pic.twitter.com/1rSIJydIIJ \n— Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) January 15, 2017 \nSNL also waded into questions about the repeal of Obamacare, with a reporter played by cast member Sasheer Zamata pressing Baldwin’s Trump on the notion that people could die if they lose their insurance. \n“Listen, sweetheart, I’m about to be president, we’re all going to die,” Baldwin’s Trump responded. \nTrump has yet to weigh-in on Twitter about Baldwin’s latest performance, which he’s called “unwatchable” and “totally biased” in the past and has said the actor's impersonation of him “just can’t get any worse.” \nDuring the show’s opening monologue, former cast member and “30 Rock” star Tina Fey made a surprise appearance alongside “Star Wars” star Felicity Jones, appearing as a Princess Leia-esq hologram to offer advice to the first-time host. \n“No matter how it goes, the president of the United States will say that it’s sad and overrated,” Fey said. “It’s fine, no one cares.” \nTina Fey returned to 8H* with a special message for Felicity Jones. #SNL \n*as a hologram pic.twitter.com/LqqSQrSpM2 \n— Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) January 15, 2017 Published: January 15, 2017 — 6:42 AM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
