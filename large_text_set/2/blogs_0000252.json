PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Last month we celebrated the life of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., an incredible example, unique in American history. You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office. And it turned out that that was fake news. Fake news. The statue is cherished. It's one of the favorite things in the, and we have some good ones, we have Lincoln and we have Jefferson, and we have Dr. Martin Luther King, and we have -- But they said the statue, the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King was taken out of the office. And it was never even touched. So I think it was a disgrace. But that's the way the press is, very unfortunate. I am very proud now that we have a museum at the national mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things. Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who has done an amazing job, and is being recognized more and more, I notice. Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. A big impact. I'm proud to honor this heritage. I will be honoring it more and more, the folks at the table, in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters. Darryl, I met Darryl when he was defending me on television. And the people that were on the other side of the argument didn't have a chance, right? And [Republican political commentator Paris Dennard Paris]. Paris has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community. He's all by himself, seven people and Paris. I'll take Paris over the seven. But I don't watch CNN, so I don't get to see him as much. I don't like watching fake news. Fox has treated me very nice, where ever Fox is, thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:48:34.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
