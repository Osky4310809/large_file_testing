Franklin Graham Says Trump Is Right About The Media \"... the news media is ...\" Advertisement - story continues below \nReverend Franklin Graham is backing President Trump’s scornful comments about the media. \n“President Donald J. Trump has been saying what we all know —that the news media has been lying. In today’s terminology, creating fake news,” wrote Graham in a Sunday Facebook post. \nThe well-known preacher used the bible to make historical comparisons about “fake news” and circulating false reports.

When Jesus died on the cross for our sins and was placed in the tomb, He said He would rise in three days. The Pharisees had guards assigned to watch the tomb, and on the third day an angel from heaven came and rolled the stone away.” \n“The Lord Jesus walked out of that tomb,” he continued. “The guards reported this to the religious leaders who instructed them that if anyone asked, they were to say that Jesus’ supporters had come and taken the body.” \nGraham said the religious leaders used “fake news” to spread their own agenda, which is exactly what the mainstream press is doing to Trump.

But we also need an honest press,” Graham wrote. “I know several members of the media personally and can say that some are extremely honest and seek the truth. But, unfortunately, that’s not the norm today.” Advertisement - story continues below Video Shows The Moment When A Fallen Soldier Makes It Home \nGraham has come to Trump’s defense on a variety of issues and frequently uses Bible comparisons as commentary on modern-day issues. In a Feb. 8 Facebook post, he told his followers that God “uses extreme vetting” when it comes to entering the gates of heaven. “I’m on my way to Puerto Rico—to warn people that God uses extreme vetting. What do I mean by that? I want the people of Puerto Rico to know that God loves them and that there is only one way to enter the gates of heaven—and that is through faith in Jesus Christ, and Him alone,” wrote Graham. \nHe was referring to Trump’s controversial immigration ban which was criticized for unfairly targeting Muslims from entering the United States. \nFox News personality Todd Starnes credited Graham for one of the primary reasons Trump was elected president. \n“I would not discount the power of what Franklin Graham did,” Starnes said during a Feb. 9 radio interview. “He did not endorse, but what he did do in 2016 was stage massive prayer gatherings at every single state capital in the country.” \n“I believe that we experienced divine intervention last November,” he added. “I believe that God was giving us a second chance. We’ve been given a second chance, and Christians, we’ve got to stand up and we’ve got to get it right.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
