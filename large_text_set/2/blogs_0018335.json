Philstar.com/File photo \nMANILA, Philippines — Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. assured the congressional Committee on Appointments at a confirmation hearing that there will be a Philippine ambassador to the United States. \nHe said that President Rodrigo Duterte had previously announced two nominees to the post. However, circumstances prevented them from accepting the appointment. \n\"But I would hope that insofar as the pending appointment that has been made already by the president, we will be able to move this forward not later than April of this year,\" Yasay said. \n\"It is on that basis that perhaps the president was in no rush,\" he added. \nYasay said this in response to Manila Rep. Rosenda \"Sandy\" Ocampo who wanted clarification on President Duterte's statement earlier in February that he does not feel like sending a Philippine envoy to the US. \n\"In the US, we have no ambassador. No ambassador will go there. Until now, we do not have an ambassador in the United States. I don’t feel like sending one,\" Duterte said during a convention the Philippine Association of Water Districts in Davao City on February 2.   \nFormer Permanent Representative to the United Nations Lauro Baja has urged President Duterte to send a Philippine ambassador to the US, saying failing to do so is not good diplomatic practice. \nREAD: Duterte doesn't 'feel like sending' a Philippine envoy to US | Duterte urged to send ambassador to US \nPresident Duterte however, had previously considered protocols chief Marciano Paynor and The STAR columnist Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez for the post. \nPaynor's appointment did not push through because of preparation for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meet in the Philippines, while Romualdez declined for health reasons. \nYasay however, said that he is hopeful the issue will be resolved soon. \n\"In the meantime, we continue with the search for having the ambassador to the United States who would really fit in terms of not only in expertise but also in resources to be able to carry out his duties effectively as ambassador,\" Yasay said. \nHe added that he and the president have always given priority to the appointment of an ambassador to the US since they took office. He said the process had been difficult since they are looking for certain qualities in the appointee. \n\"It is not just simply important to have somebody from the career who has the knowledge and expertise, the stature and the influence, because if you do not have personal resources that will assist you in carrying out your duties, you will be rendered ineffective that way,\" Yasay said.
