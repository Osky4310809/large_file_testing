Following extensive reports of civilian casualties, on Wednesday, the US Central Command acknowledged that civilians including children were “likely killed.” \n“The known possible civilian casualties appear to have been potentially caught up in aerial gunfire that was called in to assist US forces...,” US Central Command said in a statement.

A US special operations soldier was also killed and three others wounded in the surprise operation. \nMedics at the scene of al Bayda's rural Yakla district, however, said around 30 people, including 10 women and children, were killed, Reuters reported. The highest death toll - 57 people, including 16 civilians, eight women and eight children among them - was cited by officials who spoke with AFP. \nSunday’s military operation ordered by President Trump started at dawn with a drone strike on the house of Abdulraoof al-Dhahab, a senior Al-Qaeda leader. \nFollowing the initial strike, helicopters were used to deliver US special forces who raided the house. The alleged members of the terrorist cell retaliated with fire. Yemeni security officials and tribesman told AP on Sunday the fighting lasted around 45 minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:33:36.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
