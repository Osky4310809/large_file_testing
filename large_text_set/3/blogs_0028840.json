It goes with everything. \n\"This show is already being shopped internationally around the world. We are going to look at live touring, merchandise, licencing, who knows, maybe a pay-per-view in the future. \n\"But it's a full-on wrestling promotion. It's not going to just be a television show.\" Grado tackles Dave Mastiff on World of Sport Wrestling (Photo: ITV) \nThe former world champion said a new website, WOSWrestling.com, would launch imminently and host exclusive digital content. \nHe said WOS would be founded on a core of British wrestlers - the \"nucleus\" of the roster - supplemented by selected IMPACT talents. \nThe ex-WWE, WCW and IMPACT star added: \"The British scene is red hot, so IMPACT will have its influence, but WOS Wrestling is going to have its own flavour.\" \nHe confirmed there would be no restrictions on WOS talents working for other independent promotions, but said they could not appear on other TV shows. \nJarrett said: \"In my opinion independent wrestling is somewhat the lifeblood of professional wrestling nowadays. \n\"Myself and Ed have made it a real strong initiative at IMPACT, working out partnerships with [Pro-Wrestling] NOAH in Japan, AAA in Mexico, The Crash in Mexico, multiple promotions around the world. \n\"As far as on-screen, on television, that's the nature of the business we're in, so they won't be participating in other television programmes, but independent promotions, yes.\" The World of Sport Wrestling roster (Photo: ITV) \nHe said WOS would finalise its roster in the coming weeks and was considering expanding its women's division and introducing more titles. \nHinting that NOAH or AAA talents could be involved, he said: \"It's the WOS brand being revived and you can put a number on it - 60, 70, 80% British wrestlers - they are going to be the blood of it. \n\"But there are going to be international stars too, whether it's from IMPACT, Japan, Lucha Libre, Japan or whatever it may be. \n\"There is definitely going to be international stars integrated with the British talent.\" \nFormer British champion Alex Shane, who called the action alongside ex-WWE commentary great Jim Ross on the New Year's Eve special, was also present. \nHowever, Jarrett said it would be inappropriate to discuss whether Ross would return to the announce table for the new series, given his wife Jan's death last week. \nOriginal WOS legend Klondyke Kate was also on hand to address whether the show would emulate the mat-based style of yesteryear, or present a modern take on British grappling. \nShe said: \"Times move on. WOS is going to be a new venture and the talent on this roster is unbelievable. \n\"There is so much talent in this country, we don't need anybody else. What's coming is coming - look forward to it. \n\"Don't worry about what happened in the past. It's great to know it happened, but there's a new era now and these guys are going to take over. They are going to do a hell of a job.\" \nTickets for the WOS tapings, with doors at 7pm and first bell at 7.30pm, go on sale at 9am on Friday, April 7 from Gigsandtours.com / Ticketmaster.co.uk / prestonguildhall.co.uk Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:34:27.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
