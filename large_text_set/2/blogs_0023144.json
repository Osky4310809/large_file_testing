A dancer carrying a fake wave accidentally hit the actor in the face while she was singing “How Far I’ll Go” from the movie. Cravalho barely flinched and continued to serenade the star-studded audience despite the snafu.\nAt just 16 years old Cravalho already seems to be a pro. She voiced the hero Moana in an animated Disney film.\nShe performed the Oscar-nominated song with one of the film’s music writers Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. Miranda will earn the elusive EGOT title if “How Far I’ll Go” wins at the Oscars, winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:14:15.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
