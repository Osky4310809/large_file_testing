Even if he was in the side [at Arsenal], then the people were thinking that he was able to play, to begin the match. \n\"If you're on the bench and you don't come in because you're not 100 per cent, then only few people can be aware of it. \n\"But before the international break he played three games in a row. He knows that he's had a more difficult season. \n\"But he proved on Saturday that he's still an efficient striker. He scores goals with us, but he also gives to the players around him to change the attacking dynamic.\" \nAnother of the young stars putting pressure on the likes of Giroud is Borussia Dortmund winger Ousmane Dembele. \nHenry responds to Arsenal job links \nThe 19-year-old was substituted at half-time on his maiden international start against Ivory Coast last November, but he completed 90 minutes on the right flank at the weekend. \n\"Yes, it did not go well the first time,\" Deschamps said of Dembele. \"He was perhaps a little inhibited. \n\"He has reacted well with his club, where he gives good performances. He has a running speed, he likes to dribble. \n\"He has to make the right choices but he is able to unbalance defences. This game against Luxembourg will give him confidence.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:28:02.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
