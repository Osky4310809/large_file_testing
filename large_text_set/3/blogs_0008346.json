I drink a lot of water during the day, but I stay away from certain waters because their pH levels are low. Stick to alkaline waters with a higher pH. Trust me. \nThe EPA categorizes pH level as an “ aesthetic consideration ” when it comes to drinking water, meaning that they set broad guidelines for it but do not have strict requirements.
