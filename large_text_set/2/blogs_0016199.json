Photo by Laurie Skrivan, lskrivan@post-dispatch.com \nFor the third time this year, St. Louis’ no-show winter has broken a temperature record. \nThe National Weather Service says it reached 79 degrees at 1:46 p.m. Monday, one degree warmer than the record for Feb. 20. The old one didn’t last long — one year ago, a record high was set at 78. \nBefore then, the record was 77 degrees, set in 1996. \nSince Jan. 1, temperatures in St. Louis have been above average for all but 11 days. And on 25 days, daily averages have been at least 10 degrees warmer than usual. St. Louis also posted a record high on Jan. 10, when it hit 68 degrees, and on Feb. 11, at 74. \nThe Weather Service says much of that was because of steady high-level wind from the West, part of the Pacific Ocean pattern that has drenched California. The pattern has kept Arctic cold bottled up far to the north and Gulf moisture to the south. \nThe Weather Service says midday temperatures this week will remain above 70, or nearly so, through Friday. A cold front is expected that night, with a more seasonal low around 34 and a high near 47 on Saturday. \nAverage high and low temperatures for late February are 48 and 30. \nThere was an 80 percent chance of showers overnight Monday — a welcome thing, given that the area has not recorded significant rainfall since Jan. 19, when 0.4 inches was recorded at St. Louis Lambert International Airport. Since Jan. 1, the area has had only 1.9 inches, or 2.1 inches below normal, through Sunday.
