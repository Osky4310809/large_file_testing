You can book the Sky Sports Box Office event here... \nHaye has called for a fight with Joshua in recent weeks, but Hearn believes the IBF heavyweight champion would be happy for Bellew to finally end any talk of this British battle. \n\"I don't think he's the biggest fan of David Haye,\" Hearn told Sky Sports . \"I have seen a few interviews lately with AJ, where he's not bit, but sort of said I don't like that guy. \"We're looking at unification fights, the David Haye fight with Joshua is a big fight, but on Sunday that fight might not be existing ever again. Eddie Hearn \n\"He likes Bellew and Bellew is with us, and AJ is with us, so obviously he's going to want his stablemate to win the fight. \n\"We're looking at unification fights, the David Haye fight with Joshua is a big fight, but on Sunday that fight might not be existing ever again. We have to see what happens. David Haye said he's in the best shape of his life ahead of his fight with Bellew \n\"AJ will be there. He'll be ringside for Sky Sports. He'll be watching and taking it all in - like he always does. \n\"As far as AJ is concerned, and us of course, we only want one thing and that's a Tony Bellew win.\" \nHaye directed a foul-mouthed tirade at Bellew's fans during Monday's press conference in Liverpool and Hearn believes the former two-weight world champion has lost the support of the public. Haye vented his anger towards Bellew's fans this week \nHe added: \"When you talk about the man on the street, when you talk about people queuing outside that arena now, who are coming to the workout, they were coming up to me and saying: 'I'm desperate for Tony Bellew to knock him out.' \n\"The only accent I can hear is a London accent, they are not Scousers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T16:12:17.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
