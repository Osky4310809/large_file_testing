I wouldn’t wish it upon anybody or my worstest, worstest enemy.”\nMelissa Kentner, Barbara’s sister, expressed anger at how her sister was treated, both during the incident and afterwards.\nThunder Bay police said two women were walking in the early hours in a residential area on the city’s south side when one was hit in the stomach by a trailer hitch thrown from a passing car. The hitch was seized as evidence.\nAn 18-year-old man later turned himself in and is charged with aggravated assault. Police said three teenaged males and one female were in the car at the time.\nIt could have happened to anybody. I wouldn’t wish it upon anybody or my worstest, worstest enemy\n“The Thunder Bay Police Service acknowledges the impact this incident has on the community. The police are consulting with the Crown in order to evaluate if evidence gathered to date indicates if this assault can be designated as a hate-motivated incident,” the police service said in a written statement.\n“Police are aware of the reporting by members of the aboriginal community that they have been victim to objects being thrown at them by person(s) in passing vehicles. The police are also very aware that many incidents go unreported. Police are encouraging anyone who is a victim of this type of incident to contact the police as soon as possible so a timely police response may be initiated.”\nAnna Betty Achneepineskum, Deputy Grand Chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, representing First Nation members of Northern Ontario, said the alleged assault seems to be part of a growing pattern of disrespect and abuse of indigenous people.\n“I find it very disturbing. I believe that it has escalated. Like, we’ve heard stories of people where we had pop and other things thrown at us,” Achneepineskum told CBC in Thunder Bay.\nShe said she has had eggs thrown at her and racial slurs yelled from passing cars. The apparent escalation to an object as dangerous as a metal trailer hitch is worrisome, she said.\n“It does feel like a hate crime,” Achneepineskum said. “We have to do more in terms of dealing with racism and discrimination in this city.”\nRelated Aboriginal people make up 5 per cent of Canada’s population — but nearly a quarter of its murder victims Christie Blatchford: Everyday life was the ‘trauma’ for these vibrant First Nations youth who died far too young Kentner’s medical prognosis is not public information but her family says she was told there is little hope of recovery.\nAfter the initial incident, Kentner was taken to hospital. The family said the trailer hitch ruptured her small intestine and required a five-hour surgery. After her release from hospital, her recovery was slow.\nShe was afraid to go out in public, Melissa said, but mustered herself to go out for lunch after the arrest. It did not go well and she returned to the hospital.\n“This old lady comes by and kicks her frickin’ chair and the chair hit her side of the stomach and she started leaking fluid,” Melissa told APTN. “She sat in the emergency room for six frickin’ hours. She had to call 911 in order for them to take her into the back.”\nHer sister said a doctor called for a family meeting and told them Kentner’s future looks bleak.\n“There’s nothing that they can do for her,” Melissa said in the APTN interview. “It’s too far gone. Like, her kidneys are too far gone for dialysis; her liver is too …” she said trailing off. She then added: “You have to be alcohol-free for six months for a transplant.”\n“How would he feel if he was in my spot?” she asked of the man accused of throwing the trailer hitch.\nShe had to call 911 in order for them to take her into the back\nPolice are monitoring Barbara Kentner’s medical condition to see if it impacts the charge that has been laid.\n“Investigators have been in contact with the victim and will be staying up to date regarding her medical condition. That is private information. However, as with any case that may involve the death of a victim, the Crown would be consulted to review all of the evidence, including medical records, to determine what the appropriate next step would be relative to charges against the accused,” said Const. Julie Tilbury, a Thunder Bay police spokeswoman.\nWhile police said an investigation into possible racial factors is underway, any hate-crime charges must be approved by Ontario’s attorney general.\nA spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office was unable to immediately respond to questions about the case prior to deadline and is looking into the matter.\nThe Criminal Code has two sections on hate-crime charges, neither of which ideally applies to the known facts of this case, police said. Specifically, they deal with spreading hate propaganda and advocating genocide and public incitement of hatred or wilful promotion of hatred.\nIt is possible, however, if someone is found guilty in the incident, that any racial motivation could be a factor in sentencing.\nA judge is to consider any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances, including any evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor.\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of the Attorney General said that while the government takes allegations of hate crime very seriously, it would be inappropriate to comment on a case before the courts.\nBrayden Bushby, 18, of Thunder Bay, has been charged with aggravated assault. He was released on bail with a court appearance set for next month.\nAfter the incident, a community rally was held to support Kentner and raise awareness of the issues of race and discrimination in the city.\nNational Post \n• Email: ahumphreys@nationalpost.com | Twitter: AD_Humphreys \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:23:08.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
