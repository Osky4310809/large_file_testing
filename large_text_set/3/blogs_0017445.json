This is a time of reflecting on and revisiting matters of love, beauty, pleasures, creativity, money, values, and friendships. The themes started playing out around January 30th and will last until May when we will have more clarity on how to proceed forward. \nI previously wrote an article about it, which you can read here . It will play out differently for everybody depending on how it is affecting your astrology chart (based on exact birth time) and also your Sun sign. Therefore, keep in mind that the Sun sign interpretations written below are based on only part of how Venus is affecting you at this time. \nAries This is a time to reflect on how your values, self-worth, money, and relationships shape your identity. You may even be considering changing something about your appearance, just be careful that it is not something you may regret. If unsure, you may want to wait until the last week of April to make those changes. \nAries is an independent sign, and this could be a time in which you ultimately learn to value this aspect of yourself even more so. This could be a result of some changes and/or challenges with your current or potential relationships and partnerships. Reconsidering the way you express yourself in your communications could also be a factor during this period. \nSome unresolved wounds or blocks around your self-worth, relationships, and money may also surface, which could require you to have a more realistic perspective. If you are one to spend money impulsively, then this can be a time where you may face some challenges in connection with that. \nTaurus Although this can be a very active period for you externally, this is also a time to look at the inner workings of who you are. You could be considering how you value your spirituality as a whole and start to make a better a connection between your physical health and spiritual health. \nIf you have any self-defeating pleasures you should look at other ways to find joy. Some Taureans may want to get more into meditation or other spiritual modalities that help to go inward more. Selflessly helping others could also be a theme as well. \nYou may have to revisit some unfinished business in your relationships or regarding money. This is also a time to reflect on any challenges involving your friendships/network. Your personal blocks or your spirituality could create complications around a difference in values with your friends. \nGemini This is a time to reflect on the way you value (and are valued) among your friends, colleagues, employers, and social network. If you haven’t been getting enough joy out of your friendships and career, this can be a time when you are reconsidering these areas of your life. \nThe way you communicate and express yourself in your friendships may also be a theme, calling on you to do so with more love. If you are someone who is very active on social media, this can also be a good time to reflect on or revisit the way you creatively communicate your messages. \nThere may even be a new or rekindled intimate relationship with someone in your social network. Blocks or wounds in connection with your career could come up, which may be brought to light by some sort of restricting circumstance imposed by a partner or someone who opposes you. \nCancer This is a time to reflect on your career path and how you are being valued in any current career situation. You may be considering how you can or should be making more money or perhaps doing something else that may be more enjoyable. You may decide to change your direction completely if what you are doing is not in alignment with your values. \nThere may be a need to overcome any blocks you have around learning to improve your skills. This can help boost your value in the workplace and income potential. Some Cancers may even get into conflicts with coworkers, colleagues, and friends during this time due to differences in perspective. \nIf you are having challenges paying for any types of education, you may need to work more or put in some other disciplinary effort to fix the situation. If your values are out of sync with your morals and beliefs, then this could be a time to reconsider what it is that you really stand for. \nLeo You may have some experiences or considerations around travel, exploration, or education and what value you are getting out of it. Making connections or reconnecting with others in foreign lands (or connected to education) may shift your own values or the way you are valued. Whatever you are experiencing, it could be related to your career and finding your place and voice in the world. \nYou could also meet a potential lover while travelling or in school. If you are doing anything related to marketing or publishing your talents, this can also be a good time to reflect on how others view you and what changes you can make to be more aesthetically pleasing. \nSome wounds or blocks may come up around intimacy and you may need to get more serious about your creative work or responsibilities around children. If you have been having too much fun you may feel the crunch at this time. \nVirgo Money is highlighted for you during this time as you may be reflecting on and reconsidering your contribution to either a relationship, an investment, or a shared/pooled resource. It can even be related to any sort of debt payments, business expenses, taxes, or inheritance. \nFor many Virgos, this entire year can be expansive in either earning or spending, and during this retrograde consider what changes you could make in order to make things better so that nobody loses. If you are in a relationship/partnership, there could be some problems due to a conflict with values and self-worth. It may bring up some wounds that are somehow connected to challenges with your family or home. \nLibra Partnerships and friendships of all types are definitely highlighted for you at this time. This is a time of rediscovering what it is that you truly value in your relationships. Some challenges may come up that could make you reflect on your co-dependencies. You can learn a lot about what you need to change in the way you relate with people and the way you value others. \nThis can also be a time to revisit things that are enjoyable to you, perhaps creative talents and pursuits, in your day-to-day life. However, if you have been spending too much time doing more pleasurable things at the expense of your responsibilities or your health, then some challenges may surface urging you to be more attentive. If a health issue does come up, it could also be connected to consuming too much sugar or alcohol. \nScorpio The way you factor in your relationships, pets, beauty, and pleasures into your day-to-day life is up for adjustment. A shift in values could mean changing up your routine or how you manage your health. You may also be reflecting on what you value in the workplace or the way you are valued. Perhaps you are considering making your workspace a lot nicer aesthetically. \nSome of you could be making changes in your job/career that requires you to have more interactions with other people. If so, you may have conflicts which might be because you have a lot of depth and don’t like being superficial. There may be some blocks or wounds regarding intimacy, pleasure, creativity, or children that could require a shift in values, self-worth, or the way you manage your money. \nSagittarius Romance and intimacy will be very much highlighted for the majority of Sagittarians. This is a period where ultimately you are reflecting on the way you express love and what it is that you value in intimate relationships. It is possible that an old lover may return to your life, or perhaps you may get romantically involved with a friend. \nIf there is a new love interest, it will likely not be long lasting, and will help facilitate a shift in the way you approach intimacy. If you have children in your life, there may be a shift in the way they fit into your schedule or how you value your time with them. \nYou could be reconsidering how you use your creativity in sharing your wisdom and skills with others. Your preferences for social events and having fun may change as well. Some problems at home or with your family may surface, which would require more responsibility on your end. \nCapricorn You may be considering making changes to your home to make it either more beautiful, increase its value, or be more suitable for your love life or children. Perhaps you are moving or recently moved because your previous or current home was not up to par with your tastes. Your values around your home, roots, family, and personal life could go through a reevaluation as well. Some Capricorns may even want to work from home more. \nCommunication blocks could come up in the way you express yourself and your love to others. It could be connected to negative patterns due to challenging past experiences that need to be resolved. In some cases, wounds around your relationships with siblings, extended family, or people from early childhood may be involved. \nAquarius The way you value and are valued by your siblings and extended family may be a theme at this time. You may even reconnect with old friends or lovers while doing errands. People from your local neighbourhood or early childhood may even come into your life again. Any of these things could help facilitate some sort of closure. \nSome Aquarians may be feeling like redecorating their immediate environment. Others may want to get a nicer looking vehicle or communications device. If that is you, be careful that it is not something you may regret later especially if it involves big purchases. If you are unsure, you should wait until the second week of May. \nThis can be a time to revisit or reconsider any past or current aspirations related to creative writing, teaching, and communication. Learning to communicate and express yourself in a more beautiful way could also be a thing for some of you. Friends and acquaintances may push you to get realistic about your values or any challenges around self-worth and money. \nPisces Reflecting on your finances and resources is going to be a theme for you Pisces out there. What can you do to improve your situation? Perhaps you need to be more efficient and organized with how you manage your resources. Others may need to figure out a way to make more money to keep up with expenses. If you have any self-worth issues, this can be getting in the way of boosting your earning potential. \nIf you are mutually involved with others financially, you may feel like you are getting the shorter end of the stick and need to renegotiate. Alternatively, you may be considering borrowing or investing money to help you get ahead. Career responsibilities may push you to overcome any blocks or wounds around your identity, appearance, and self-worth. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:26:54.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
