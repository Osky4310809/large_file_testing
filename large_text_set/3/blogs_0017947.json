Now, Chance The Rapper has illuminated the particulars of his deal with Apple, revealing on Twitter that they paid him $500,000 and gave him a commercial: I never felt the need to correct folks on my relationship with @apple but now that more people have tried to discredit my independence.. \n— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 I wanna clear things up. @apple gave me half a mil and a commercial to post Coloring Book exclusively on applemusic for 2 weeks https://t.co/dMWwptrHHH \n— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 That was the extent of my deal, after 2 weeks it was on SoundCloud for free. I needed the money and they're all good people over there https://t.co/5kIhv0YaKS \n— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 I feel like if I didnt clear it up people would keep trying to discredit all the work we did to make Coloring Book what it became https://t.co/05v81I38ur \n— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 I think artist can gain a lot from the streaming wars as long as they remain in control of their own product. https://t.co/6agVO3uIdf \n— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 I just wanna remain transparent. Folks out there without a deal need to know they're doing everything right just keep at it. https://t.co/5udstMPX62 \n— Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 17, 2017 If you come across oprtunities to work with good people, pick up cash and keep your integrity I say Do It https://t.co/yF0gBPkLhY", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:03:11.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
