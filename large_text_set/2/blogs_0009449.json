She then took off the cape to reveal a form-fitting blue dress with Donald Trump’s signature slogan on it. And the back of her dress bore the word “TRUMP” in sparking letters. \nPeople were quick to take notice — one user asked: “How much did he pay you?” However, some were quick to support her dress choice. One user said, “beautiful girl in a beautiful dress,” while another said , “this Joy Villa person has every right to wear a super ugly dress that says more about her poor character than anything else.” GREAT #MAGA dress who knew the #Trump flag could be made into such a beautiful gown!
