The player has achieved a good level of function, however he has been unable to reach the stage required to make a full return to training.

This will result in Erik returning to action next season. pic.twitter.com/heu7xk6I2f - Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) March 29, 2017 \n\"Therefore, following ongoing extensive consultation with specialists, surgery has been agreed by all as the best course of action.\" \nEarlier this month, Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino insisted Lamela's absence had nothing to do with the family issue that forced him to return to his homeland in December, but he said he did not know when the attacker would return. \n\"I can't say one, two weeks, three weeks, one month or maybe next season -- I don't know. My position is too difficult because we are assessing him every day,\" Pochettino said. \nLamela, who joined from Roma for Â£30 million in 2014, has two years remaining on his current contract and at the start of the season sources told ESPN FC that the club had opened talks over a new deal. \nDan is ESPN FC's Tottenham correspondent.
