Image copyright ABC Image caption The absentee ballot had been sent to Mr Curtis' home \nThe accused, a radio host, has railed against alleged voter fraud on his show, Wake Up With Steve Curtis. \nHe told listeners about five months ago: \"It seems to be, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but virtually every case of voter fraud I can remember in my lifetime was committed by Democrats.\" \nHis ex-wife, Kelly Curtis, told KDVR-TV, a Fox affiliate: \"I was livid over the whole situation, definitely.\" \nShe only discovered her ballot had been used when she called election authorities to inquire about how she can vote, considering that she was registered in Colorado but had just moved to South Carolina. \nAn election worker told her she had already voted. \n\"I was just completely stunned,\" said Mrs Curtis, who now lives in South Carolina. \n\"I thought there had to be some kind of mistake. \n\"For somebody that speaks out for the constitution and voters rights and our right as US citizens, it definitely goes against what he talks about on his shows and how he lives his life.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:36:23.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
