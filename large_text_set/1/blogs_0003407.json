UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 16 hours ago 2 Rob Scallon has announced the release of new album \"The Scene Is Dead,\" featuring a set of original songs crafted with extended-range guitars.As the first single, the guitarist unveiled a track called \"Gas Mask Catalogue.\" You can stream it below.Rob explained about the effort: \"The album was made with extended-range guitars. 4 tracks of which featuring the 9-string tuned to C# or double drop B. This song was written with the goal of sparingly using the extended low-range for particular accents and leaving most of the riffing to regular guitar territory. And if I was able to shred well enough to play Pete's solo it would include all the strings...\"The tracks on this album are named after no longer with us metal bands from the Chicago suburbs. The album is dedicated to them and all the other local bands that made up our local metal scene growing up.\"Special guests on the album include Jeff Loomis, Pete Cottrell, Ola Englund, Sarah Longfield, Garrett Peters, Leah Woodward, and Rabea Massaad.If you donate $1 or more via Patreon by the end of the month, you'll get your name printed on the record.
