Except for the new color, the new (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 is similar to the existing iPhone 7 variants that Apple currently sells. \nThe new model is a way for Apple to create awareness about HIV/AIDS among its customers and help fight the deadly virus and illness with the charity (RED). The company has launched many (PRODUCT)RED branded products and accessories in the past, with part of the sale proceeds going to charity. The red iPhone 7 in Taiwan features the (PRODUCT)RED branding, while the listing on Appleâ€™s China website is devoid of any such branding \nIn China, however, Apple is not promoting the red iPhone 7 under its (PRODUCT)RED branding. This is because HIV and AIDS are a controversial subject in China. While the media has helped create awareness of AIDS and HIV among the young Chinese people, gay couples in the region are still at a huge risk of being infected with the virus. Reports indicate that in the first nine months of 2016 alone, more than 96,000 new cases of HIV were reported in China. \nApple likely decided to skip the (PRODUCT)RED branding for the new iPhone 7 in China to avoid any controversy. The company is already caught in a trade war between the US and China and did not want to further make matters worse for it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:05:43.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
