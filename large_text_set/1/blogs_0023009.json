More than 40 years ago, the idea of a sunny sitcom mining laughs from death was intimidating enough that none of the show’s regular directors wanted to touch it. (It fell to a rookie from the outside.) But on Oct. 25, 1975, “Chuckles Bites the Dust” triumphed over tragedy to become Mary Tyler Moore’s — and TV’s — most celebrated half-hour. \nThe setup for the night’s installment of CBS’s longtime Saturday hit about WJM-TV career girl Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) was basic: A local parade enlists the station’s celebrity clown as grand marshal. But the premise, and the comedy, takes a twisted turn when Chuckles, dressed as alter-ego Peter Peanut, is crushed to death en route (off-screen). \n“Shelled by a rogue elephant,” reports newsroom chief Lou Grant. \nLet the jokes begin, from an ad-libbed on-air tribute (“Chuckles died today a broken man”) to a newsroom toast for a show-biz veteran (“Born in a trunk, died in a trunk”). Before long, WJM is awash in hard-to-pass-up tasteless yuks, to the disapproval of everywoman Mary, who shames her colleagues for their insensitivity. Lou tries to explain: “It’s a release — we all do it.” \nCounters Mary, “I don’t.” Appreciation: Yes, Mary Tyler Moore really did turn the world on with her smile \nNot until Chuckles’ funeral, when try as she might (and does she ever try) Mary can’t stop herself from dissolving into laughter among a sea of stone-faces during the eulogy for the life of a clown well-lived. It’s an excruciating (for her) and belly-laugh-inducing (for us) four minutes of inappropriateness that also offers a master class in physical comedy from its star (MTM won another Emmy). \nThe series that broke 1970s working-woman ground dug 6 feet deeper with “Chuckles Bites the Dust”: With a craftily written script (David Lloyd) and sympathetic direction (Joan Darling), it laughed first and loudest in the face of the ultimate last laugh — long before edge-riding cable-TV content. The New York Times hailed it “the funniest half-hour in television history.” Twenty-two years later, it ranked #1 on TV Guide’s 1997 list of Best TV Episodes ever. And in 2015, it’s still sitcom’s standard-bearer for excellence in weaving the macabre and the comedic. \nNot bad for a clown who made the ultimate sacrifice. \n“And what did Chuckles ask in return?” asks his eulogist in that funeral scene. \n“Not much. In his own words, 'A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants.' \" 175 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE  //usat.ly/1NlgqNq NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
