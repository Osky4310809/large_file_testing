Still, the order to classify broadband Internet as a public utility passed.\nAs far back as 2014, Trump has opposed Net Neutrality. Misunderstanding Wheeler’s order, the President said at the time that “Obama’s attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.”\nPai boasted that Net Neutrality’s “days are numbered” at a think tank gala in December. “Today, I am more confident than ever that this prediction will come true.” The new chairman , in his words, aims to “fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation, and job creation.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:35:08.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
