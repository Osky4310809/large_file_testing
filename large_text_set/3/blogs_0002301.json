Others suggested it might mean Just Another Codename. The ambiguous nickname made enough of an impression that the question still lingers. At Warren Spector's post-mortem at GDC today, a fan asked flat-out what the 'JC' stood for. And the answer? It really was Jesus Christ. \n\"But there's more to the story than that,\" Spector said, as the crowd started clapping at the revelation. \"One of my best friends is a wonderful writer named Bradley Denton, who you should all go read\" he continued. \"And if you want to know about me and my friends, he wrote a book called Lunatics that you should go read, and you can try to guess who I am. Anyway, he is one of the nicest humans on the planet. If you ever need help with anything, he's always there for you. He's so helpful it gets annoying sometimes, so back then I would often find myself saying 'Jesus Christ, Denton. Jesus Christ, Denton, don't be so helpful. So when it came time to name the charcater it was JC Denton. \nThat line is actually hinted at in the game on a couple ocassions, when characters react to your actions with \"Jesus Christ, Denton!\" and \"Jesus Christ, JC!\" \nThere's always been plenty of ammunition to support the theory that JC stood for Jesus Christ. Religious symbolism. JC's brother Paul. The name 'Deus Ex.' But nobody knew 'Jesus Christ, Denton' was a regular Warren Spector quote. \nYears later, prequel Deus Ex: Human Revolution's hero being named Adam kept the theme alive. ABOUT THE AUTHOR As hardware editor, Wes spends slightly more time building computers than he does breaking them. Deep in his heart he believes he loves Star Wars even more than Samuel Roberts and Chris Thursten, but is too scared to tell them.
