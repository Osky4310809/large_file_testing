stairway during the incident \nA 26-year-old Iraq war veteran has been arrested after five people were shot dead at an airport in Florida . \nEsteban Santiago was taken into custody immediately following the shooting. \nThe FBI said investigators had not ruled out terrorism as a possible motive in the shooting and were reviewing the suspect's recent travel. \nMr Santiago, who had served in the US military, had arrived in Fort Lauderdale shortly before 1pm local time (6pm Irish time) yesterday on a connecting flight from Alaska, authorities said. \nHe then retrieved a 9mm semi-automatic handgun from his checked luggage and began firing indiscriminately. \nBroward County Commissioner Chip LaMarca said on Twitter that the gunman went into public toilet to load his weapon and came out firing. \nWitnesses told MSNBC television he only stopped after running out of ammunition, at which point he surrendered to police. \nThe gunman, who wore a \"Star Wars\" T-shirt, said nothing as he fired, witnesses told MSNBC. \n\"This is a senseless act of evil,\" Florida Governor Rick Scott told reporters. \nA White House spokesman said President Barack Obama had spoken to Scott and Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief and had extended his condolences to the loved ones of the victims. \nIn addition to the five killed, eight others were wounded by gunfire and some three dozen were taken to local hospitals with bruises or broken bones suffered in the chaos surrounding the shooting. \nFBI Special Agent George Piro said that Mr Santiago had turned up at an FBI office in Anchorage last November behaving erratically and was turned over to local police, who took him to a medical facility for a mental evaluation. \nA federal law enforcement official told Reuters that Mr Santiago told agents at the Anchorage office in November that his mind was being controlled by a US intelligence agency, which was ordering him to watch Islamic State videos. \nHe served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and Alaska National Guard including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon. \nA private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before being transferred to the inactive ready reserve in August last year. \nAn aunt said he came back from his deployment \"a different person,\" MSNBC reported. \nFlying with firearms is routine and legal in the United States as long as the guns are kept in a locked, hard-sided container as checked baggage only, under TSA rules. \nAmmunition is prohibited in carry-on bags but is allowed in checked luggage. \nJohn Schlicher, who told MSNBC he saw the attack, said theshooter was \"directly firing at us\" while passengers waited fortheir bags. \nHis wife gave first aid to a victim who had been shot in the head, and his mother-in-law also tended to another victim but it turned out that person was already dead, he said. \nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport is the second largest in South Florida, serving as an intercontinental gateway. \nNearly two months ago a former Southwest Airlines worker killed an employee of the company at Oklahoma City's airport in what police called a premeditated act. \nThe deadliest mass shooting in modern US history took place last June, when a gunman apparently inspired by the so-called Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando.
