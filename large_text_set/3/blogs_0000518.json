Schaefer works for the Inquirer. More by Mari A. Schaefer Arrow icon \nAnimal welfare officers are investigating the death of a female pit bull that was found stabbed, with her mouth taped shut, in a garbage bag in Philadelphia's Olney section. \nThe Pennsylvania SPCA is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever was responsible for the death of the dog, found by a passerby Thursday evening on the 200 block of West Godfrey Avenue. \nThe black dog had identifying white marks on her nose, under her neck and across her chest. She was wearing a black collar. \n“There is no question that the death of this dog was an intentional act of violence,” Nicole Wilson, PSPCA Director of Humane Law Enforcement, said in a statement. “This case is particularly concerning because offenders of crimes against animals often commit acts of violence toward humans. We are pleading with anyone with information about the individual(s) who committed this horrific act to come forward.” \nAnyone with information should contact the shelter's Cruelty Hotline at 866-601-SPCA. Tips can be left anonymously.
