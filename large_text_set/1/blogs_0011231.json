Hannibal was ordered out of line for a more thorough pat-down, which is when he sarcastically remarked to his wife and six-year-old twin daughters: \n“They’re looking to confiscate my explosives.” \nHannibal quickly discovered TSA officials don’t have much of a sense of a humor. He was cuffed and led out of LaGuardia and promptly spent 25 hours in a lockup. \nHannibal has now brought a lawsuit against a TSA worker at LaGuardia and a Port Authority cop. The TSA worker, identified as Edwin Sanchez in court papers, overheard Hannibal and didn’t get the joke. He promptly called the cops, and within minutes Officer Spencer Newman had shown up to lead Hannibal from the airport and charge him with falsely reporting an incident, a felony. \nAs if that weren’t enough to ruin his day, Hannibal revealed to The New York Daily News that the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in prison just weren’t up to scratch : \n“The jelly looked like pus, the peanut butter like God knows what and the bread was hard as a rock.” \nOf his arrest and subsequent detention, the peanut butter guru said: \n“It sounds laughable now but at the time to be led out of there like a terrorist was unbelievable. My whole life was up in the air. It was a nightmare. My children were overwhelmed. It was crazy.” \nAs for the peanut butter that started the trouble, Hannibal revealed cops returned his jar after his release. \nWhat do you make of the TSA’s response? A gross overreaction, an honest mistake, or a fitting punishment for a pretty dumb joke?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:44:14.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
