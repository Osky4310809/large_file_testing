Photo by Christian Gooden, cgooden@post-dispatch.com \nThe looming ice storm forecast for the St. Louis region is prompting area grocery stores to add staff and make sure essentials such as milk and bread are available in large quantities. \nShoppers are already scurrying to make sure they have plenty of food on hand to ride out a storm that could bring three-fourths of an inch of ice in some parts of the St. Louis region beginning overnight Thursday and into the weekend. \n“We started seeing a good rush yesterday, it's continuing today and it will right up until the storm hits,” said Paul Simon, spokesman for Maryland Heights-based Schnuck Markets Inc., which operates dozens of local grocery stores. “We've been serving customers for 78 years, so winter storms are nothing new to us. It's something we prepare for and we know what we need to do.” \n• Keep track of St. Louis weather-related closings and cancellations \nGrocery shelves are often picked clean of bread, eggs and milk, which some jokingly call the “French toast” grocery list. Simon said Schnucks is staffing up area stores to make sure products that are in high demand are accessible. \nSchnucks began adding extra staff yesterday as the region braces for the storm. “We automatically add the essentials – milk, eggs and bread,” Simon said, adding frozen pizza and peanut butter and jelly are also in high demand. \n“We also encourage stores to build displays near the front of stores with ice melt, shovels and windshield wiper fluid,” Simon said. \nDierbergs Markets shifted some deliveries to earlier this week to ensure stores would be well stocked, said the Chesterfield based chain's senior vice president and chief operating officer Andy Pauk. \n\"We're seeing a big rush now right now with people anticipating the weather,\" Pauk said Thursday afternoon. \"With the storm slated to hit on Friday, people who normally would shop over the weekend are shopping earlier.\" \nSome grocery stores may close early this weekend due to weather conditions. \"Employee safety is extremely important,\" Pauk said. \"We may look at closing early; we have done that in the past.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:54:31.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
