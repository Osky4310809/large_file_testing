And, although the historic Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts lost some buildings, it’s up and running, continuing to inspire and promote creativity. \nGatlinburg Mayor Mike Werner, who lost his own home and business, says the best way to help these beautiful mountain communities is to “come back and visit us.” Luckily, the state’s number one attraction, Dollywood , was spared and will be open for the new season in March. Meanwhile, here are ten great places to visit right now. 1. Great Smoky Mountains National Park \nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park — Photo courtesy of Lois Alter Mark \nThe country’s most visited national park is world-renowned for its diversity of plant and animal life and is located within a day’s drive of one third of the U.S. population. One of America’s 20 World Heritage Sites, it encompasses 800 square miles and showcases some of the most fascinating remnants of Southern Appalachian mountain culture. \nStop in at the Sugarlands Visitor Center to pick up maps or join a park ranger on a tour. Then head to historic Cades Cove, the park’s most popular destination – and keep an eye out for bears. \nArensbak Trolls at 5 Arts Studio — Photo courtesy of Lois Alter Mark \nWith the success of the DreamWorks movie of the same name, trolls have become celebrities in their own right, making this cozy studio/museum/shop outside of Gatlinburg a must-visit. Home of the Arensbak Trolls, 5 Arts Studio is a truly magical place where you can watch these mythical creatures come to life, lovingly crafted by hand out of natural materials from the nearby forests. \nThere are trolls for every personality, profession, hobby and occasion, and it’s easy to understand why they’ve become collector’s items since Ken Arensbak created the first one in 1959. 3. French Broad River Outpost Ranch \nFrench Broad River Outpost Ranch — Photo courtesy of Lois Alter Mark \nThis all-inclusive dude ranch gives you the opportunity not just to ride horses through gorgeous country, but to get real hands-on experience grooming, saddling and bonding with them. \nWhen you’re not with the horses, you can channel your inner cowboy or cowgirl on cattle drives or just take a nap on the porch after a delicious home-cooked meal. Hosts Shawn and Jo Ann Gannon are warm, welcoming and hilarious, and will make you feel like family. 4. Great Smoky Arts & Crafts Community \nArtist G. Webb — Photo courtesy of Lois Alter Mark \nAn eight-mile loop that’s home to more than 100 artist studios, this historic area of Gatlinburg has been designated a Tennessee Heritage Arts & Crafts Trail. Established in 1937, it is nationally recognized as the largest group of independent artisans in North America. \nMeet the craftspeople and watch them whittle, carve, paint, sew and weave. A great place to buy authentic souvenirs, you can take home an original piece of one-of-a-kind art. 5. The Old Mill \nLunch at The Old Mill — Photo courtesy of Lois Alter Mark \nA working tribute to the pioneer days of the Great Smoky Mountains, The Old Mill is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a hub of activity. Centered around the 200-year-old water-powered gristmill which can still turn out 1000 pounds of stone-ground grain a day, Old Mill Square features a variety of unique shops including the Old Mill General Store, Iron Mountain Metal Craft Shop, Old Mill Creamery and Pigeon River Pottery. \nTake in the river view and the homemade comfort food at the Old Mill Restaurant, where guests are treated to a basket of mini muffins, Smoky Mountain Special Preserves, and sourwood honey with breakfast, and a basket of fritters and maple butter with lunch and dinner. \nOGO for zorbing at Outdoor Gravity Park — Photo courtesy of Outdoor Gravity Park \nIf you’ve never tried zorbing, hang on! Invented in New Zealand, the sport involves slipping and sliding down a hill inside a giant transparent ball called an OGO. At the Outdoor Gravity Park in Pigeon Forge, four unique tracks provide a variety of zorbing experiences so you can roll alone or with friends. Choose the dry or wet version and don’t worry about the cold: in winter, warm water is used to make you feel like you’re in a rolling Jacuzzi. 7. The Island \nThe Island in Pigeon Forge — Photo courtesy of Tennessee Department of Tourist Development \nYou could happily be stranded for days at The Island , a new shopping and entertainment complex in Pigeon Forge. Book a room at the four-star Margaritaville Island Hotel (each room has a private balcony and, yes, a “frozen concoction” maker), then start exploring. \nTake a ride on the Great Smoky Mountain Wheel, enjoy dinner at Paula Deen’s Family Kitchen and pick up some goodies at Emery’s 5 & 10 (the oldest family-owned five and dime in the country). Then, depending on just how much of a change in attitude you need, plop yourself into the St. Somewhere Spa at the hotel for their signature Wastin’ Away massage or the Express 5 O’Clock Somewhere Mani/Pedi. 8. Titanic Museum \nTitanic Museum — Photo courtesy of Lois Alter Mark \nPaying homage to the famous ship, a visit to the Titanic Museum in Pigeon Forge is moving, sobering and fascinating. Upon entering, you're handed a boarding pass with the name of an actual passenger or crew member whose fate you will later discover in the Memorial Room. \nThe tragic journey becomes more real through interactive experiences like touching an iceberg, walking the $1 million exact replica of the Titanic’s Grand Staircase and navigating the sloping decks of the ship’s stern as the Titanic goes down. 9. Blackberry Farm \nBlackberry Farm — Photo courtesy of Lois Alter Mark \nThis stunning retreat in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains is the perfect place to unwind, to get in touch with nature and to indulge your senses. Blackberry Farm is synonymous with simple luxury. \nYou can take classes, get spa treatments and participate in farm activities with adorable animals. Or you can just while away the hours in the resort’s signature rocking chairs, taking in the breathtaking views. Whether you opt for a room, a cottage or a house, you will never want to leave. 10. Tony Gore’s Smoky Mountain BBQ & Grill \nTony Gore and his famous desserts — Photo courtesy of Lois Alter Mark \nSize matters at this award-winning eatery , where the portion size is as legendary as the food. Bring the whole family so instead of having to decide between the ribs, pulled pork, chicken or catfish, you can taste them all. Start with an order of T’s Loaded Tater Chips, smothered in pulled pork, melted cheese and barbecue sauce. Best advice: Come hungry and wear your stretchy pants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T10:01:43.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
