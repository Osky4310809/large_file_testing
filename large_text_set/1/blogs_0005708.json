As a school-going teenager who had just begun to discover the joys of exploring the city in the company of friends in those days, my late arrival often used to be a source of anxiety at home. We lived in suburban Chennai and it often took me longer to return home than my friends who lived in the city. \n\nMy grandmother held the view that it is women who should exercise caution in order to safeguard themselves. Boys, however, need not be restricted in this way, she would say because they weren't as vulnerable to the sexual threat as women were. Listening to Karnataka Home Minister G. Parameshwara's response to the molestation incidents in Bengaluru on New Year’s Eve that it was the western attire of the women and their hanging out late at night that resulted in molestation attempts on them, brought back memories of what my grandma used to say. \n\nPrudence over liberty \nOn January 1, I was at my professor’s place discussing gender and rights with a few alumni of Madras Christian College when women’s freedom entered the discussion. I was surprised to find how women participants themselves felt that self-regulation was necessary for women to remain safe in society. \n“If I complained about getting robbed after walking in a dark alley at night wearing gold jewellery, I cannot blame the robber alone for the incident,” one of the alumni, a single woman with several years of work experience in the corporate sector, said, implying that women must be practical in the interest of their own safety. The lady’s comment was in response to the December 16, 2012, Delhi gang rape incident, in which the victim was blamed for hanging out with her male friend at night, sparking widespread outrage among other women in the capital. I brought the case up for discussion to draw attention to the rampant victim-blaming that exists in India whenever such incidents occur. \nShould we not aim to create a society wherein women felt safe to step out no matter the hour of the day, and must not men be held responsible if they misbehaved, I asked. But I found myself marginalised. Other participants in the discussion too emphasised “prudence” over women exercising their liberty to walk the streets at night. It was remarkable how nobody thought substance abuse among men was the main reason why such incidents took place, and demanded strict measures to put a check on drunken men instead, as alcohol played a key role in the way men behaved both in Bengaluru a few days ago and in Delhi in 2012... \nDevelopment without freedom \n\nOften when molestation and rape incidents take place and women protest in response to it, they are gently reminded that their lot is much better now than it was in the past. While there is no doubt that women in India are more educated and economically better off now than they were around 6 decades ago what remains lacking is women’s parity with men when it comes to key development indicators in society. \nFemale literacy, just after the Independence, stood at 8.86 per cent of the total female population. In the 2011 Census, this figure was 65.48 per cent of the total female population. However, the gap between male and female educational attainments has remained almost the same over the years. In 1951, 27.16 per cent of men were literate in society, while in 2011, male literacy was over 80 per cent of the male population. \n\nLiteracy rates as per Census YEAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T14:49:58.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
