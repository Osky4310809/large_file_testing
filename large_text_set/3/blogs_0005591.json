Graham Feels the Heat at S.C. Town Hall as Crowd Jeers About Russia, Obamacare by Vaughn Hillyard advertisement \nCLEMSON, S.C. — Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham faced a barrage of frustration from rowdy constituents Saturday as questions continued to swirl around the Trump campaign's communications with Russia and the tenuous future of replacing Obamacare. \nDespite remaining one of President Donald Trump's fiercest intra-party critics, Graham faced 1,000 primarily anti-Trump attendees at a town hall on the campus of Clemson University, soaking in cackling jeers as he defended his vote to confirm Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, his potential support for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act and his resistance to the issuance of a subpoena for Trump's tax returns . \n\"I didn't know there were this many liberals in South Carolina,\" Graham quipped.

I don't even know what the GOP plan is,\" Graham said. \nHe followed with a message directed toward the Republican lawmakers crafting the possible replacement proposal: \"Don't give Lindsey Graham take it or leave it options. Cause I'll leave it. I want to be a part of this. I want you to know what we're doing,\" he warned. Sen.

Sean Rayford / Getty Images \nA day earlier, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters to \"expect in a matter of days\" a \"very brisk pace of legislative activity.\" \nBut Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price remained mum Friday about a health care-related proposal when asked by reporters. \nIt wasn't just Obamacare that had people upset Saturday. Graham found himself in contention with the crowd over the investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged connections to Russia before the November election. He said he met with FBI Director James Comey on Friday and iterated that there is \"no evidence\" of collusion at this point. \nRelated: Obama Spokesman Disputes Trump's Wiretapping Claim \nBut Graham told the gathering that a congressional subcommittee, which he chairs, will investigate Russia's interference in the election and insisted Congress would pass a bill strengthening sanctions on Russia as punishment. \n\"It's my job as a United States senator to get to the bottom of this,\" Graham said from the stage. \nThe attendees asked him five separate times about potential efforts to gain access to the president's tax returns as a way to help understand any ties with foreign entities. \n\"We can subpoena his tax return,\" Graham suggested to cheers, before interjecting: \"I will do that when I believe there's a reason to do that.\" \nThe theater hollered in response, believing there already is a reason to act as many shouted: \"Russia!\" \"He's here!\" man shouts, after heckling Graham all event. pic.twitter.com/0XgjYHssE5 — Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) March 4, 2017 \nGraham was just the fifth Republican senator to hold a town hall in his home district since Trump was sworn in as president on Jan. 20.
