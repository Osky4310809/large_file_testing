If you haven’t seen it yet, don’t worry. The main ending won’t be spoiled here, but there are some tidbits you might want to avoid if you hate spoilers at all levels. \nThe cast and creators of the show were at Paleyefest 2017 on Saturday night and apparently, mum was the word on any juicy details about season two. That doesn’t mean nothing of value wasn’t pulled from the chat, but it does mean there aren’t any major revelations on what we can expect once the show returns in 2018 . Jonathan Nolan was not ready to share any secrets at all, while Lisa Joy made her way around without sharing too much. This seemed to be the theme for the entire production of the show because even the cast seemed to be in the dark about most of the show’s big secrets. \nEd Harris and Jimmi Simpson were apparently not aware they were playing the same person , Evan Rachel Wood was unaware Bernard was a robot, and she also thought she was the dastardly Wyatt. It was just a big secret party, even when Nolan once again spills the beans on Thandie Newton’s Maeve actually making her decision to stay in the park on her own and sparking “free will” among the machines. It’s one of the many things that will be explored during season two, complete with a slight change in format according to TV Insider : \n“I think as with Season 1, any basic different timelines were rooted in what the characters were going through,” Joy noted. “At that point, it made sense to do multiple timelines, because it showed how Delores felt, and that confusion: I’m in love, but this guy is coming for me. [Only] then realize, I haven’t changed, but so much time has changed and now he’s this. The timeline thing is in service of landing that point of view for Delores.”\nIn Season 2, “I think we’ll experiment in different point of views and different angles,” Joy continued. “You don’t necessarily want to repeat the same thing.”\n\nThere was also no confirmation about that Samurai World coming into play during season two, but how could it not? You can’t just tease something like that without playing around with it. And it seems that they know that and know that the world outside will take some time to come into view : \n“I think we imagined with the show, it would be a slow and steady pullout [of what’s going on],” he continued. “The first season there would be a glimpse of the world, and as the seasons go on, you see a little bit more as our hosts come to understand what the real world is.” Added Joy: “Also, swordplay.”\nJoy did reveal one tidbit we can fully expect in season two — one of the newer musical cues that people came to enjoy during season one. Those damn player piano tracks will return, but it seems that Joy and Nolan will inject something sinister into a children’s tune at some point in season tw o: \n“At home, we have a little girl, so we spend a lot of time watching children’s movies, and one of them has proven to be, musically, incredibly inspiring,” Joy revealed. “So there may be a strange shoutout to a very kind of innocently joyful song, that we’ll take, and co-opt, and make dark.”\nAs Nolan jokes about during the panel, most of Reddit has already peeled back the answers for season two and none of this matters. They already know Anthony Hopkins is still alive, that Samurai land will be joined by Clown land and Customer Service land by season three, and that everybody outside of Westworld is actually dying slowly because the planet has been knocked off its axis. Prove me wrong! \n(Via TV Insider / IndieWire / Deadline )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T19:53:40.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
