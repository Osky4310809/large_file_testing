It's especially significant considering Fisher was a mental health advocate and very open about her own struggles. \"I am mentally ill. I can say that. I am not ashamed of that. I survived that, I'm still surviving it, but bring it on. Better me than you,\" she told Diane Sawyer in 2001.

A big pill,\" he said, \"She loved it, and it was in her house, and Billie [Lourd, her daughter] and I felt it was where she'd want to be.\" \"We couldn't find anything appropriate.
