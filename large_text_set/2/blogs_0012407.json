She was scared of this because it was dark and full of spiders,’ he said.\n‘She would be so scared that she would agree to do what he asked.’\nNow 21, Driver was been given a prison sentence of four years at Gloucester Crown Court today.\n<figure class=\"alignnone img-container shareable-item\" style=\"max-width:620px\"><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a id=\"item-attachment_6453694\" class=\"anchor\"></a><div class=\"item-share-buttons item-share\"><a class=\"share-item share-item-facebook btn\" title=\"Share this on Facebook\" data-track=\"share-item-facebook\"><span class=\"icon icon-facebook\"></span></a><a class=\"share-item share-item-twitter btn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share this on Twitter\" data-track=\"share-item-twitter\"><span class=\"icon icon-twitter\"></span></a><a class=\"share-item share-item-pinterest btn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share this on Pinterest\" data-track=\"share-item-pinterest\"><span class=\"icon icon-pinterest\"></span></a></div><img data-attachment-id=\"6453694\" data-permalink=\"http://metro.co.uk/?attachment_id=6453694\" data-orig-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/pa-4146826.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&strip=all\" data-orig-size=\"1200,730\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"PA Archive\\/PA Images\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"General view of Gloucester Crown Court.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1163462400\",\"copyright\":\"PA Archive\\/PA Images\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"Gloucester Crown Court\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}\" data-image-title=\"Teenager locked girl in cupboard full of spiders so he could rape her\" data-image-description=\"<p>General view of Gloucester Crown Court.<br /> Credit: PA</p> \" data-medium-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/pa-4146826.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&strip=all\" data-large-file=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/pa-4146826.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1024&strip=all\" class=\"img-align-none size-full wp-image-6453694\" src=\"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/pa-4146826.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&strip=all\" alt=\"General view of Gloucester Crown Court.
