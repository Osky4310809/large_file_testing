King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 9 hours ago 12 \nMark Tremonti (Creed, Alter Bridge, Tremonti) was recently asked by All That Shreds whether he ever took guitar lessons, to which he replied: \n\"I took one lesson and I asked if he could teach me how to play Metallica back in the day and he said, 'No, I don't know that song, I'll teach it to you next time.' \n\"After my second lesson, he didn't have it prepared for me so I quit! [Laughs] He tried to teach me the Mel Bay 101 book and it wasn't what I wanted to learn.\" \nThe guitarist added: \"Yes, [I basically just taught myself what I wanted to do]! Self-taught and I'm glad I am now, because it was a process that gave me my own sound. It didn't move me into a guitar-teacher sound.\" \nWhen it comes to 2017 plans, Mark said: \"I'm going to be writing a Tremonti album. After this [Alter Bridge] tour is over, I'm going to have the guys come to town and start writing and just kind of pick our moments to keep writing and probably get a record out next year.\" \nThe musician also said that Wolfgang Van Halen is not likely to join the Tremonti gang, noting: \"I don't believe so. He's doing his own project right now. It's either he's playing bass in somebody else's band or he's singing and playing bass and drums and everything in his own project right now and I'm sure he's going to want to put all his efforts into promoting that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:21:02.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
