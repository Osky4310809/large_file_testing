Opponents also say the project could damage sites sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux. \nThe Army Corps said Wednesday that it granted the easement allowing the construction of a 30-inch pipeline on federally controlled lands at the Oahe Reservoir. The project is nearly finished, and the easement covers 1.25 miles of the pipeline that runs under the Missouri River. \n\"With this action, Dakota Access now has received all federal authorizations necessary to proceed expeditiously to complete construction of the pipeline,\" Energy Transfer Partners said in a statement Wednesday.

Terray Sylvester / Reuters \nUnder Obama, the Army Corps and the Justice and Interior departments said in September that \"this case has highlighted the need for a serious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes' views on these types of infrastructure projects.\" \nDemonstrations against the project erupted in violent clashes at times, with equipment set on fire and allegations by protesters of excessive force used by authorities, including being doused with cold water in freezing temperatures. The Morton County Sheriff's Office said water wasn't used against protesters but was used to douse fires. \nRelated: U.S. Army Corps Gives Eviction Notice to Dakota Access Protest Camp \nPresident Donald Trump said in a Jan. 24 memorandum that the pipeline served the national interest and ordered an approval review , which included the easement. The pipeline has been projected to transport about 470,000 barrels of oil a day, with a maximum capacity of 570,000 barrels a day.
