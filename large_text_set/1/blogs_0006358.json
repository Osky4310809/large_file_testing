Watch as his nephew excitedly points to the Ohio State hat, and then his reaction when his brother picks UCLA. \nCB Darnay Holmes' nephew is not pleased (h/t @bangulo ) #ArmyBowl pic.twitter.com/AGXhSBAL8V \n— #ArmyBowl (@ArmyAllAmerican) January 7, 2017 I guess you can’t please everyone in recruiting, right? Hopefully this adorable nephew can come around to visiting his uncle in Los Angeles. Holmes is the No. 2 cornerback recruit in the country, so the Bruins just got a huge pick-up with Holmes’ commitment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:02:58.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
