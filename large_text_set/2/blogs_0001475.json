Speaking of Yellowstone, it was the very first national park — or was it?! View this image ›\nArchive Photos / Getty Images Yellowstone was declared a national park by an act of Congress on March 1, 1872, but in recent years, some have argued that Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas should be recognized as the first, since it was created (as Hot Springs Reservation) in 1832.\nID: 10427561 3. Either way, Yellowstone is basically just a giant freakin’ volcano , and if it ever erupts, we’re toast. View this image ›\n© kwiktor / Getty Yellowstone is technically a supervolcano , which means it’s capable of an eruption of more than 240 cubic miles of magma. The most recent eruption, which happened more than 640,000 years ago, made the area collapse around itself, creating the geysers and boiling hot springs that makes the park so distinct. When it erupts again , which probably won’t happen anytime in the next 10,000 years, it could spread ash as far as Florida, make the air smell like sulphur, and damage crops for years.\nID: 10428869 4.

For example, in Yosemite National Park, which had the largest cluster of vanishings at the time, there were almost always huckleberries in the area of disappearance. He also found that most lost persons are children ages 20 months to 12 years old, and the elderly ages 74 to 85, and that many of the areas that people have disappeared from have names like Devil’s Gulch, Devil’s Lookout, Twin Devil Lake, and Devil’s Punch Bowl.

The NPS first hired female park rangers in 1918 , just two years after it was founded. View this image ›\nNational Park Service / Via sierracollege.edu Clare Marie Hodges, also called “Yosemite Clare,” is considered the very first fully-commissioned female park ranger. The earliest women hired by the parks were supposed to be temporary employees to fill spots left vacant by men serving in World War I, and many were brought on as “ranger-naturalists” who did tours and ran educational programs. Male employees, who saw themselves as military-like rugged protectors of nature, weren’t thrilled about this , seeing the women as threats to their careers and even calling male ranger-naturalists “pansy pickers” and “butterfly chasers.”\nID: 10445005 16. In fact, the NPS might not exist if it weren’t for the help of women ! View this image ›\nNational Parks Sevrice / Via nps.gov The National Women’s Club had thousands of women sign the bill to establish the NPS in 1916, and clubs like the Garden Club helped maintain park grounds. It wasn’t until Title VII was made law in 1964 that NPS jobs fully opened up to women. As of 2016, women made up about 40% of the total NPS workforce — although, sadly, there is still a lot of work to be done .\nID: 10445140 17. And until 1978, female park rangers weren’t allowed to wear the same uniform as their male counterparts. The standardized '60s uniforms. Options for a female park ranger in the '70s. National Park Service / Via nps.gov Until 1947, there was no standardized uniform for women, and they could design or choose whatever they wanted to wear. When a uniform was finally introduced, it included a calf-length skirt and a jaunty hat .\nThe NPS redesigned the women’s uniform in the ’60s, modeling it after flight attendants’ uniforms, but it was not popular. As one female park ranger said at the time, “We climb hills and mountains and rocks. It’s rugged…We need something more functional. Loose slacks are fine and Levi’s are great.” Even the hat was a point of contention! Apparently, everyone thought it was “unattractive, dated, and a threat to their hairdos.”\nBy the 1970s, things were even worse — women now had seven options to pick from, but many called them the “McDonald’s” uniform. Thankfully, this rock bottom moment led to the NPS to authorize women to wear the exact same uniforms as men in 1978.\nID: 10450299 18. Some parts of the distinctive park ranger uniform are descended directly from the United States Army Cavalry’s 19th century uniforms .
