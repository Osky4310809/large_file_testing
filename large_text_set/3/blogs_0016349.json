You have to be ever vigilant and ready for anything. Below are 20 of the most painstakingly embarrassing kid moments that really drive their point home. You’ll laugh, you’ll cringe, you’ll be glad it didn’t happen to you… \n“My daughter’s daycare had circle time every morning as a way to start the day. Anyway we were late and walked into the middle of circle time. My daughter said, ‘We’re late because my mommy had diarrhea.'” 2 \n“My child once approached and overweight woman in a store and congratulated her on eating her entire dinner.” 3 \n“As I was discussing finances with a professional (read: important, grown up conversation), my son grabs on to me and starts yelling “My butt hurts, my butt hurts! It has poop in it!”” 4 \n“Do not spray sunscreen in the toaster oven, do not pour a whole bottle of dish liquid in the toilet. Lastly do not pour cooking oil all over the kitchen floor so you can slide around in it.” 5 \n“Discovered a jar full of pee in family room closet. Turns out 7 yr old didn’t want to go to bathroom so was peeing in the jar.” Advertisement Advertisement 6 \n“I let my daughter draw all over my back and shoulders with washable marker–then I forgot and ran errands all afternoon that way.” 7 GIF \n“When I was 5 or 6, we were at my dad’s company picnic. I was introduced to his boss and I told him, ‘My daddy says you’re a son of a —–.’ My dad’s coworkers fed me ice cream all afternoon.” 8 \n“When at another child’s birthday party, the host asked me what I would like to drink. My daughter answered, “Mommy will have wine.”” 9 \n“Your child opens a birthday present at their birthday party and loudly proclaims, “I don’t like it!”” 10 \n“My daughter decided to strip completely naked, nappy and all, in the shop when I had my back turned for about five seconds. I only became aware when a lovely lady tapped me on my shoulder and whispered into my ear, ‘Excuse me, love, your child is dancing naked beside the potatoes.'” Advertisement Advertisement 11 \n“I was so hungry and didn’t want to wake my baby, so I sat in the car, in a parking lot, and ate baby food (yuck!) from the jar, accidentally spilling some on my shirt. Right then my old boss pulled up next to me – I had the spoon in my mouth and baby food on my face.” 12 GIF \n“My toddler wanted to play with my makeup, so I let her put eye shadow and blush on me. But then I forgot about it … My husband laughed so hard when he got home and I was horrified I had walked around town all day looking like that.” 13 \n“When your child refuses to do that awesome thing you were just telling people they could do and have been doing quite frequently. Like say “Nana” on the phone.” 14 \n“We were in line at the grocery store when my six-year-old saw a black man and said, “HEY LOOK IT’S OBAMA!” We live in Idaho and don’t see many African Americans, but…still…” 15 \n“When my son was about a year old, he was “painting” the table with guacamole at a Mexican restaurant. The waitress leaned over the table next to us, and he grinned and slapped her on the bottom with his messy hand.” Advertisement 16 GIF \n“Whenever your child ruins something they don’t own. Breaks someone else’s stuff, draws on someone else’s walls, gets food/vomit/poop on someone else’s clothing. There’s not really a way to make it better.” 17 \n“When your child bites someone. Anyone. But particularly when it’s a doctor or strangers. Y y.” 18 \n“When my sister was pregnant with my nephew, my sister kept the baby’s name a secret from my then 4-year-old niece. While babysitting my niece, I convinced her that her parents were planning to name the new baby Homeslice. She announced her new brother’s name to everyone in her daycare, random strangers at the grocery store, or anyone else who would listen. My sister still hasn’t forgiven me for that one.” 19 \n“Once, in the middle of the store, my six year old loudly proclaimed “I WANT TO BE A POLE DANCER!” 20 \n“In the toilets at a local supermarket. Mother Nature was paying her visit. My 4-year-old son came in the toilet with me … Went running out of the toilet to announce to his grandma, and the rest of the supermarket, that ‘My mummy has a piece of string hanging out of her bum.'”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:02:40.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
