At the time, he was arguing that his client’s car spontaneously combusted and wasn’t intentionally set on fire. \nGutierrez quickly left the courtroom. Jurors also were escorted out. \nWhen Gutierrez returned unharmed, he insisted it wasn’t a staged defense gone wrong. The Herald reports he blamed a faulty e-cigarette battery. \nMiami-Dade police and prosecutors are investigating the incident. Investigators seized frayed e-cigarette batteries as evidence. \nMiami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman could decide to hold Gutierrez in contempt of court. \nGutierrez represented 48-year-old Claudy Charles who was eventually convicted of second-degree arson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:49:34.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
