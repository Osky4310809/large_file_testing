Years after first coming to prominence during the recession as a way for those in the know to enjoy experiential dining options on the (relatively) cheap, the new model is still alive and well at places like Feastly , the Arts District loft space known for hosting some of the best chefs as they incubate their coming concepts. In fact, the place has proven so successful, they’ve expanded into a second location in Venice.\nLike most modern pop-up destinations, the official Venice address of the new space won’t be revealed to anyone but registered diners, so you'll have to book if you want direct access. That said, a couple of pop-up dinners have already broken in the space, and more are on the way, with offerings from the Banh Oui team and former Viviane chef Michael Hung.\nThe expansion to the Westside should help all those in Venice, Santa Monica, and beyond sick of having to take rideshare apps (or find parking) around the Arts District. It also shows a continued appetite for private, intimate dinner experiences in a city already loaded with brick and mortar restaurants. With rotating chefs and relatively low overhead, it's entirely possible that pop-up spaces (and pop-ups in general) could once again be on the rise around Los Angeles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:46:41.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
