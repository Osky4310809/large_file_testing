UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 12 hours ago 4 \nCorey Taylor has confirmed that Stone Sour are set to release their sixth studio album this summer under the title of \"Hydrograd.\" \nThe singer told Rock Cellar : \"We are doing everything old school. We're recording it live and then layering stuff on top of it. \n\"We are doing a song a day, and we've already done nine songs; we're about halfway done. And, yeah, it is incredible; it's the best stuff we've ever written.\" \nCorey previously said about the new material: \"It is such a great amalgam of all of these different styles that we just absolutely love. It's got a little bit of the heavy, like we like to do, but it's also way more hard rock - way more rock 'n' roll and hard rock than heavy. I mean, there's even a little bit of punk in there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T06:26:24.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
