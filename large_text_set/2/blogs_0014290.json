The meeting would be held before the NEDA Infrastructure Committee (Infracom) meets end of March. \nAn official knowledgeable about the matter said JICA would also present alignment options for the P375-billion subway system that would link the business centers of Makati, Pasay and Taguig. \nThe official said JICA has already conducted initial presentations for various stakeholders of the project. \nThe proposed subway project would be composed of both underground and elevated railways that would link the Makati Central Business District, Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, and the Mall of Asia Complex in Pasay. \nThree possible alignments for the proposed subway are being considered for the 20-kilometer train system, one of which is the following: Market-Market, St. Lukes Medical Center, MRT3 Buendia Station, Ayala/EDSA, Ayala Triangle, Makati Post Office, PNR Buendia, Buendia/Taft Ave., World Trade Center, Mall of Asia, EDSA/Taft Ave.   \nRight of way issues also have to be ironed out before the project can be undertaken. \nJICA is expected to finish the feasibility study for the project by the third quarter of the year, said the official. \nThe subway is considered by NEDA as a priority project for decongesting the flow of traffic in Metro Manila. \nThe project, which was first proposed under the Aquino administration, was shelved because of its massive cost and right of way issues in the Bonifacio Global City area where elevated stations may be situated. \nIn January, JICA chief representative Susumu Ito said the agency remains interested in helping finance the construction of the subway. \nIn line with the Japanese government’s promise to scale up investments and provision of aid to the Philippines, Ito said JICA is intent on providing financing support for infrastructure and poverty reduction projects in the country. \nThe IATCTP – composed of NEDA and various government agencies related to transportation – is mandated to formulate and recommend to Infracom comprehensive and integrated transport plans among other functions. The NEDA-Infracom, in turn, advises the NEDA Board on matters concerning infrastructure development. \nIt also tasked with providing the NEDA Board with up-to-date information needed in the review and evaluation of transport plans and projects.
