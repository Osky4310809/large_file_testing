Who died?’ and then there were other people who said, ‘What’s next?’” she told a crowd at the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council’s Summit Salute on Thursday.\n“I don’t want a friend who calls me saying, ‘Oh my God.’ It’s a job. It doesn’t define me. It doesn’t determine what I do … how I treat people. I’m going to always look you in your face and say, ‘Thank you’ and ‘Please’ — and if you make me mad, a good cuss word — but in the end, a title can’t define you. When your card no longer says anything beneath it, but your name, are you still you? Can you still savor the victory — the moment that you were able to take that dream? I never imagined that I would be on the ‘Today’ show.”\nHall was the keynote speaker at the event. The “Deadline Crime” host recently teased an upcoming special she’s working on, airing in April.\nRelated Video 1:25 The 'Today' show is the best soap opera on TV Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:08:59.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
