On June 3, he gets his wish, as he will battle Brazilian icon Anderson Silva in a UFC 212 bout in Rio de Janeiro. In the main event of UFC 212, which airs live on Pay-Per-View from Jeunesse Arena, Jose Aldo meets Max Holloway for the undisputed UFC featherweight championship.A former Ultimate Fighter winner who scored five wins at welterweight, the 25-year-old Gastelum is making even more noise at 185 pounds, where he has knocked out Tim Kennedy and Belfort in his two most recent bouts. Unbeaten in Brazil for over 16 years, Silva’s storied career saw him reign over the middleweight division from 2006 to 2013, fighting and beating the best 185-pounders in the world in the process. In February, the 41-year-old Silva turned back the clock once more when he defeated Derek Brunson at UFC 208, and he has his sights set on slowing Gastelum’s momentum when they meet in June.
