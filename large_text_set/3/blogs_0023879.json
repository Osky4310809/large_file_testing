Sir Alex Ferugson’s set to return to Manchester United’s dugout, and the club promising £1 Premier League tickets. \nAll that and more in Paper Talk! \nLALLANA’S MISS COST PUNTER STAGGERING PAYOUT \nAdam Lallana said “sorry” after his horrific missed kick costed Liverpool two points, but one punter may also want a personal apology. \nCome the end of the Premier League season, those dropped points in the draw with Manchester City could see the Reds miss out on a Champions League spot and at least $18 million for qualifying for the competition. \nWhile Jurgen Klopp’s side will have to forget the result and look forward to the fixtures ahead, this punter will likely never forget what happened. Liverpool's Brazilian midfielder Roberto Firmino (L) and Lallana react after his miss. Source: AFP \nThey placed $160 (£100) on Manchester United, Tottenham, Celtic, Atletico Madrid and Liverpool to all win with both teams scoring in each match. \nThe first four had come true and he just needed the Reds to come through. \nJames Milner opened the scoring against City before Sergio Aguero levelled the match, so if Lallana had scored and won the game for Liverpool, then the punter would’ve earned $138,424 (£86,260.42) from William Hill. \nBut when Firmino crossed the ball to Lallana with 11 minutes to play, he completely missed the tap-in. \nCheck out the punter’s betting slip below. I bet this guy has big hatred for Lallana this morning!! pic.twitter.com/osYWPdNWLT — Footy Accumulators (@FootyAccums) 20 March 2017 \nMAN CITY CHARGED BY FA \nThere’s bad news for Manchester City as well after the draw with the Football Assocation charging the club for failing to control their players during the match. \nPep Guardiola’s man surrounded referee Michael Oliver when he awarded Liverpool a penalty after Roberto Firmino was brought down by Gael Clichy. \nOliver booked both Clichy and his Spanish teammate David Silva -- who was the most forthright in protesting -- after awarding the penalty. \nCity have until Thursday (UK time) to respond to the charge. Aguero misses golden chance 0:36 \nSIR ALEX SET FOR RETURN TO MAN UTD’S DUGOUT \nAfter seven years, Sir Alex Ferguson will return to the Old Trafford dugout to take charge of a Manchester United 2008 XI in Michael Carrick’s testimonial match. \nFerguson retired in 2013, but will lead a side comprising of Premier League and Champions League-winning players from the 2008 squad against a Michael Carrick All-Star XI managed by Harry Redknapp, who once managed the Red Devils midfielder. \n“Honoured that he’s going to come back and be part of the game,” said 35-year-old Carrick. \n“He’s probably the sole reason I came to the club and I can’t thank him enough. Sir Alex Ferguson. Source: Getty Images \n“He’s been a huge influence on my career, learned so much from him and he’s the man who probably taught me to win.” \nSome of the players involved will be Edwin van der Sar, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs for United, and Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Michael Owen for the All Stars. \nZLATAN: A KING RECOGNIZES A KING \nZlatan Ibrahimovic likely won’t be involved in Carrick’s testimonial with football royalty, but he has been rubbing shoulders with real royalty. \nThe Swedish striker posted a photo of him with former King of Spain Juan Carlos I. \nIbrahimovic once claimed he would become the “King of Manchester”; maybe he was hoping the meeting will further push his bid.

A post shared by Paul Labile Pogba (@paulpogba) on Mar 19, 2017 at 4:25pm PDT \n£1 TICKETS IF BRADFORD MAKE PREMIER LEAGUE \nBradford City are currently three points off automatic promotion to the Championship, but club co-owner Edin Rahic has promised £1 tickets if they move into the Premier League one day. \nCity haven’t been in the top-flight for 16 years, and now a ticket for a Premier League match can cost at least £30-£45. \nBut with the new TV broadcast deal, Rahic would be prepared to sell tickets for £1. \n“It’s our dream, of course, to be in the Premier League and, if we get there, the tickets will be £1 per game,” Rahic said, per The Times. \nRahic added: “You already get at least £100 million from the TV money. The income of the ticketing would be a small percentage compared to TV money.” Can't argue with those prices from @officialbantams Retweet if you think more clubs should be as reasonably priced as Bradford City pic.twitter.com/gpFE0fBckq — Football Away Days (@sportingawayday) 16 March 2017 \n“When you look at ticket prices in the Premier League, when even the bottom of the table gets £100 million in TV money, I think it’s a shame to charge so much. \n“So why would you not give something back to the fans? I want to have the best atmosphere in England.” \nBUNDESLIGA’S YOUNGEST COACH HONOURED AS LEAGUE’S BEST \nHoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest coach in the Bundesliga, has been named the German football federation’s coach of the year for 2016. \nThe 29-year-old Nagelsmann was honoured in particular for his work with youth players as he saved Hoffenheim from relegation last season. \nUnder Nagelsmann this season, Hoffenheim is fourth in the Bundesliga, which would secure a playoff for the Champions League. \nNagelsmann says, “That such an honour is given to me as a rookie nearly makes me speechless, and that happens rarely.” Hoffenheim's coach Julian Nagelsmann.

His assistant was cleared. In case you are wondering, here the penalty that led to Joseph Lamptey ban. pic.twitter.com/uzCkDEl5zq — I'm a Man (@Mzilankatha_) 20 March 2017 \n“All charges against the Ghanaian match official David Lionheart Nii Lartey Laryea, whose behaviour had also been the subject of investigations, were dismissed,” FIFA said. \nSouth Africa scored the penalty kick to lead 1-0 in the 42nd minute in Polokwane last November. \nThe home team went on to beat Senegal 2-1 and is now in second place in the four-team group after two matches. \nSenegal is third, with only the group winner advancing to play in Russia. \n- Additional reporting with AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T06:41:55.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
