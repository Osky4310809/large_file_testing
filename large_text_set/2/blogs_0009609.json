And, exactly as we predicted , there were some pretty major upsets. Namely that Beyonc√©‚Äôs Lemonade did not win any of the evening‚Äôs top prizes for which it was nominated. Sigh .\nThat said, being Grammy night, there were more stupendously extravagant performances than one could keep up with. Here are a few of the evening‚Äôs highlights:\nAdele wins Album of the Year, dedicates it to Beyonce: \"I can't possibly accept this award.\" #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/9Msjhz9Cj6 \n‚Äî Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 13, 2017 \n\nBy all accounts, Lemonade was utterly robbed. Even Adele felt this way, particularly after her own album 25 swept all three of the night‚Äôs top categories. In her tearful acceptance speech for Album of the Year, Adele wept at how unfair these results were. ‚ÄúMy album of the year was Lemonade , so a piece of me did die inside, as a Beyonc√© fan‚Äù she said after winning. To make up for it, she literally split her Grammy in half.\nAdele Broke her Grammy and gave the other half to Beyonce!

Introduced by her mother Tina Knowles and prominently addressing the recent announcement of her pregnancy, it was a decadent, but intimate, family affair.\nChance The Rapper, Kirk Franklin and Tamela Mann brought the church to the #GRAMMYs 2017 pic.twitter.com/bB51vkTasu \n‚Äî What's Trending Sa (@whatstrendingSa) February 13, 2017 \n\nAs far as pleasant surprises of the evening go, it was a huge, huge night for Chance the Rapper. He made Grammy history with Coloring Book , the first-ever streaming-only album to take home a prize, let alone one as big as Best Rap Album. He also won Best New Artist, and performed a medley of hits from the album that made for a truly dizzying showcase.\nRT\nFULL PERFORMANCE!\nAqu√≠ la presentaci√≥n completa de The Weeknd y Daft Punk en los #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/l9oV6mWnMo \n‚Äî Fest Jumpers (@FestJumpers) February 13, 2017 \n\nDressed like very chic versions of Darth Vader, Daft Punk made their return to the live stage for the first time since winning Album of the Year in 2014 for a set with The Weeknd, on whom they collaborated on the latter‚Äôs smash album Starboy . They briefly teased the title track before going into ‚ÄúI Feel It Coming.‚Äù\nA Tribe Called Quest perform with Anderson .Paak, Busta Rhymes and Consequence at the #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/Kz35sUTEs7 \n‚Äî Wol√© II (@Kingwole) February 13, 2017 \n\nAs the evening‚Äôs most political act, A Tribe Called Quest did not disappoint. Together with Busta Rhymes and Anderson .Paak, the group performed their song ‚ÄúWe the People‚Ä¶‚Äù with explicit and necessary attacks to the policies of Donald Trump.\n\"No hate!\" @katyperry performs at the #GRAMMYs wearing a pantsuit and a \"persist\" armband https://t.co/7d49FZHGZf pic.twitter.com/hNhX6cZw9b \n‚Äî CNN (@CNN) February 13, 2017 \n\nThough decidedly less forthright than A Tribe Called Quest, Katy Perry premiered her new song ‚ÄúChained to the Rhythm‚Äù in a context that was still more message-laden than most of the pop-star‚Äôs previous offerings. \nYeah\nRT @RJthaDon89 \nBruno Mars the only person that could've pulled off a Prince tribute right pic.twitter.com/fRTdK2Vm2d #GRAMMYs #music \n‚Äî Roberto Blizzard (@VeganYogaDude) February 13, 2017 \n\nThe big tribute of the night arrived for the Purple One himself led by his former band The Time, but the real showstopper moment took place when Bruno Mars barrelled out of the gate singing ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go Crazy‚Äù dressed in homage to Prince‚Äôs iconic Purple Rain get-up. He may not have the range of the late legend, but at least Bruno has the right attitude.\nBe sure to read our take on why the 2017 Grammys are the most out of touch yet right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:45:12.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
