I have learned my lesson and come armed with only a cup of Seattle’s best as I tackle today’s supplied devotional, “He Is In Control.” \nAhh, yes – fear not, God is in control – a promise that during my years as a Christian sounded almost too good to be true! An unprovable empty promise that, upon escaping the church, I now see more clearly as a soul-crushing threat, “You’re not in control, God is!” I must ask – who but a broken slave or lost sheep would welcome such oppressive tyrannical rule over their lives? \nBut, I get ahead of myself – let’s begin with the supplied scripture from the Old Testament: \nVerse Of The Day: “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” – Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV) \nAhh, there it is… a promise of prosperity. Indeed, this would be a comforting verse to anyone suffering from calamity – and why wouldn’t it be? Promises of personal prosperity and hope, a supernatural force manipulating the word with just you in mind! Who wouldn’t love to receive such a gift? It almost sounds too good to be true! \nTheme Of The Day: Aaron Tabour offers a couple short paragraphs which outline one of the most used sales pitches of the modern church, especially those preaching the “prosperity” gospel. Beginning with a subtle-but-not-humble claim, “we must remember that God ultimately controls [everything],” the author then outlines a number of unexpected hardships and tragedies that can face anyone at any time, always just lurking around the corner, waiting to strike when you are least expecting. Such uncertainty, fear, and despair. Ahh, but fear not, my precious sheep, “He Is In Control.” Geez… why not focus on any good surprises that might come up in life? Oh, that’s right – because the prospect of happiness wouldn’t instill the feelings of helplessness needed to convert grieving mothers into tithing parishioners. God’s got it all covered? Then what am I here for – why bother? Now I really do feel helpless. And, why wouldn’t I? As the Bible says… God creates it all: From AMCB (vol. #3). \nAll that said, isn’t there’s something much more sinister about this idea that He Is In Control ? To assert that God is actively in control of everything in your life is not just narcissistic, but it is to ask those that are truly suffering today to grin and take it, for their misery is all part of a divine plan. To use just a few examples from the book, “a friend betrays you, the test results scare you, your boss undermines you,” – who are you to react? You have no right to object, He Is In Control! Hell, just ask poor miserable Job , one of God’s most devout followers what it feels like to submit to God’s plan. I’ll admit – in the few years since leaving my faith behind, I’ve come to find the willingness to subject one’s self to such supernatural capriciousness as, well… heartbreaking. Secular Alternative: Good or bad, shit happens. Sometimes it is completely out of our control, other times it is directly a result of our own actions. Either way, the key is how we actively “deal” with all of the challenges and opportunities life throws our way, no gods necessary (but some personal responsibility might be required). If you spend your life asking others to “ take the wheel, “ you might crash into a house . Keep your hands on the f*cking wheel, people! (Also, don’t text and drive.) While this devotional keeps with Christian themes of subtly terrifying people into accepting compulsory helplessness, I’m not ready to give up and think I’ll take my chances with myself and those around me. If life happens, I won’t blame God (or the little red guy with a pitchfork), I’ll just get on with… life . \nSee you tomorrow, Horus Gilgamesh P.S. I’ll admit, when the author claims that, “God is the same – yesterday, today, and tomorrow,” I almost had to spit out my coffee. But, I’m sure an opportunity to discuss that bit of irony will come again. ;-) \n= = = = = \nFAIR USE NOTICE: This is a book review.
