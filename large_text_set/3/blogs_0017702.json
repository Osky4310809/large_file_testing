Amir Khan and wife Faryal Makhdoom (Photo: PA) Faryal has certainly embraced the limelight in recent months... (Photo: Snapchat/FaryalMakhdoom) \n\"Because of lack of sleep, genes, dehydration, I get bags under my eyes and I wanted to get them lightened. So I went to my doctor, Simon – he's Kim Kardashian’s doctor,\" she said. \n\"I like high cheekbones. I’ve never had plastic surgery. Fillers and plastic surgery are two different things and I want people to understand that,\" she insists. \nHer justification for this is that she's now in the 'limelight' thanks to her nuptials. Something that could potentially include a role in Celebrity Big Brother . \n\"If other women had this money and if they had a husband who was famous, they would do it, too. If I wasn’t married to Amir Khan, I’d probably be a regular girl and I might not do it. But I’m in the limelight, I go to events, so it’s part of my life now.\" The couple pictured back in 2013 - before the family drama was revealed (Photo: PA) \nEarlier this year she told her Snapchat followers that she's considering the CBB offer - though she didn't reveal how much money they were trying to lure her with. \n\"Hey guys, I got asked to be on Celebrity Big Brother ... it's a very tricky one and idk if I can do it,\" she wrote in a post. \"I want all my followers advice. On my last Instagram post tell me whether I should or shouldn't? I want you guys to pick! X.\" \nHowever, despite embracing the media interest, she said she's also keen to have another child with Khan - irrespective of any domestic dramas. \n\"My husband wants another child so badly,\" she confesses. \"But I want my daughter to be an independent woman – Islam teaches that. I want her to go out, get her career, do whatever she wants and I will support her one hundred per cent.’\" \nHowever, it's not clear whether any new addition will be raised in Bolton, Lancashire, where Khan is from. She describes the town as \"a village compared to New York\".
