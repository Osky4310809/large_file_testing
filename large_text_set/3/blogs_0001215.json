The shares opened for trading at $24, higher than the IPO price of $17.\nIt was the first tech IPO of the year and the largest tech deal since Alibaba went public in 2014.\nBased on the opening price on Thursday, Snap had a market cap of about $33 billion, greater than corporate giants like Macy's and American Airlines, and about $22 billion more than Twitter, a competitor.\nEarly investors are betting on the potential of Snap's advertising platform and the company's ability to grow the number of active users, amid questions about valuation and a recent slowdown in user adoption.\n\"Investors in Snap will be exposed to an upstart facing aggressive competition from much larger companies, with a core user base that is not growing by much and which is only relatively elusive,\" said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, in a note on Thursday. He rated the stock a \"sell\" with a $10 price target.
