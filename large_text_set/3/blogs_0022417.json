England's Michael Keane warms up before the match (Photo: REUTERS) Read More Michael Keane says Rio Ferdinand's advice has helped him to brink of England debut \n\"We've got two big games coming up with Germany away in Dortmund,\" he said. \"I can't wait for that one especially, \n\"It's going to be a special occasion and it's great to be a part of it. If I can get on and make my debut, then I'd be over the moon. It's been a dream of mine so we'll just have to wait and see. \n\"I've been desperate to do it all season. I've been away twice now so hopefully it'll be third time lucky. It's something I've dreamt of since I was a young boy, so if I can do that then it'll be a big milestone for me. Keane is ready to play at the highest level (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n\"They are two fantastic games. Obviously Germany is what it is, but to do it at Wembley would be equally as special if not even more special. As long as I get on the pitch, I'll be delighted.\" \nKeane, 24, has impressed for Burnley, who are on course to have their best season since they last survived in the top flight in 1975, and hopes Gareth Southgate has taken note. Southgate has some big decisions to make ahead of the Germany game (Photo: The FA via Getty) \n\"I feel like I've been doing well,\" said the former Manchester United trainee. \"I feel like I've been defending well and I've been good on the ball as well. \n\"Hopefully the England set up has been watching that and they see me as being part of their plans. \n\"It's just exciting. When I first went it was a bit surreal, but you quickly get used to it. Playing for the Under-21s gears you towards that so I felt comfortable around it. I'm just desperate to play now.\" poll loading Do you agree with Gareth Southgate that England must be more, ahem, 'streetwise'? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:41:43.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
