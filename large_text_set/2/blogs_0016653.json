But America's newspaper of record did find a way to work in some subtle jabs at the school, which required answering.\nThe Times ' Erick Eckholm argued that the issue of race \"captures the juxtaposition of Hillsdale's pathbreaking origins with its present-day conservatism.\" Hillsdale College claims to have been the first college to admit students regardless of race or sex — in 1844. The college boasts of sending more students (and professors) to fight for the Union than any other school, due to in part to its opposition to slavery. But Eckholm Quote: d the current president, Dr. Larry Arnn, suggesting that the school's opposition to \"social justice\" betrays a racist conservative philosophy.\n\"My answer to the charge that we do not promote 'social justice' is that we don't and that I am proud that we don't,\" Dr. Paul Rahe , professor of history and Charles O. Lee and Louise K. Lee Chair in the Western Heritage at Hillsdale, told PJ Media in an email statement. \"Justice is owed individuals, not groups. There is no such thing as 'social justice.' The phrase is a slogan used by those intent on looting.\"\n\"In any case, Hillsdale is an educational institution. It is improper for such an institution to promote a partisan agenda in the classroom,\" Rahe added. \"When such an institution does so, it substitutes indoctrination for education. Our aim is to turn out well-informed, intelligent citizens capable of making up their own minds.\"\nHow does Hillsdale educate rather than indoctrinate? The college exposes students \"to the great debates that took place in the past,\" the history professor wrote. \"In treating slavery, for example, we read the arguments made on all sides — advocates of slavery such as John C. Calhoun, opponents such as Frederick Douglass, the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Nothing like this would take place in a course promoting 'social justice.'\"\nNevertheless, Rahe emphasized the school's pedigree on race. \"You have to keep in mind that Hillsdale was antislavery from day one,\" he wrote. \"We were, I believe, the first institution of higher learning in the country to offer college degrees to women and the first to admit African-Americans. The place was a stop on the underground railroad. Frederick Douglass spoke on the campus.\"\nConservative School Beats Yale, Makes Top Ten College Newspapers\nThe Times ' Eckholm attacked the school for allegedly minimizing its view of slavery in American history. He noted, rightly, that at Hillsdale \"the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are exalted for recognizing the natural rights of man and role of government as protector of those rights.\" But then Eckholm contrasted this view with an allegedly more popular one. \"The Constitution's enshrinement of slavery, in this view, was a horrid expediency to win adoption in the South — a malignancy that ultimately had to be excised in blood rather than an indelible original sin.\"\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/21/hillsdale-prof-to-ny-times-i-am-proud-we-dont-promote-social-justice/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/education/edlife/hillsdale-college-great-books-constitution-conservatives.html?_r=0&referer=http://m.facebook.com", "https://www.hillsdale.edu/faculty/paul-rahe/"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:07:17.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
