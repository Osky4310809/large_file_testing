Same goes for the cheerleaders, who are also tasked with staying fit and maintaining morale regardless of whether their team is up by 3 touchdowns or down 20 points with 5 minutes left in the fourth quarter. If you think NFL cheerleading is just about flashing a peppy smile, wearing a short skirt, and waving around pom-poms, think again: These women can probably outlift and outrun the average Joe and casual gym bro. \nSuffice it to say that these hard-working women don’t get enough credit for the training they put in. For starters, some work other jobs during the season. Plus, you try crushing a HIIT workout without ruining your eyeliner. That’s why we’re showcasing some of the strongest, sexiest NFL cheerleaders in the game. Because as every NFL post-game interview states, the victory is a total team effort. \nLet’s appreciate these strong, sexy women while the playoffs last.
