The Saharan Dust Layer can be discerned in the far right edge of this image of Earth. This dry air from the coast of Africa can have impacts on tropical cyclone intensity and formation. © NOAA / NASA \nGOES-16 features an Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) camera that can scan half the Earth in five minutes, and a Global Lightning Mapper (GLM) that will continuously track and transmit all lightning across North America. \n“ The incredibly sharp images are everything we hoped for based on our tests before launch. We look forward to exploiting these new images, along with our partners in the meteorology community, to make the most of this fantastic new satellite, ” Volz added. This composite color full-disk visible image is from 1:07 p.m. EDT on January 15, 2017 and was created using several of the 16 spectral channels available on the GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument. © NOAA / NASA \nGOES-16 is the first of a four satellites in the GOES-R series that will extend to NOAA’s geostationary coverage over the next 20 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:20:19.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
