If everything comes together just right, we could easily quadruple that total Monday night. But the closer you get to Interstate 95 and especially areas to the east, the less certain significant snow becomes. Follow along as track the latest model predictions this evening and see if we can get any more clarity on how much snow will fall and where. [ Winter storm watch: Significant snow possible late Monday into Tuesday, but amounts uncertain ] \n9:15 p.m. update: To illustrate how close D.C. may be to the rain-snow line Monday night, let’s look at this (admittedly crude) representation of it from the SREF model (described below). The animation below shows three time snapshots Monday night into Tuesday morning at 11 p.m., 2 a.m, and 5 a.m. Notice how the District goes from snow to rain to snow. It’s close… SREF model simulation of rain snow line overnight Monday. (StormVistaWxmodels.com) \n9:00 p.m. update: The first model we’ll look at this evening is actually an average of a group of models known as the Short-range Ensemble Forecast System or SREF. This group of models suggests the region will experience plenty of precipitation Monday night into Tuesday, the equivalent of 1 to 1.5 inches of rain. SREF model total lquid equivalent precipitation for storm Monday night into Tuesday. (StormVistaWxModels.com) \nOf course, we’re expecting the majority of this precipitation to fall as snow. Typically, an inch of rain equates to about ten inches of snow. But because Monday night’s snow will be heavy and wet, we might expect one inch of rain to equate to about seven inches of snow in the immediate metro area. Even with that assumption, when you do the math, this model is predicting the potential for a lot of snow – with double digit totals possible in some areas. \nA limitation of this model group is that some of the individual models which comprise it sometimes produce precipitation totals that are unrealistically high. So it’s possible the amounts it is suggesting are slightly overdone. \n8:50 p.m. update: To get us started, let’s take a look at the National Weather Service snow accumulation forecast. The map below, which was released at 8:10 p.m., predicts widespread totals of 4 to 10 inches, with amounts increasing from southeast to northwest. The highest amounts are north and west of the Beltway and a few spots in northern Maryland are predicted to exceed a foot. The lowest totals are in southern Maryland, where one to four inches or less are expected.
