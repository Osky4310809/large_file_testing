By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 28, 2017 4:26 PM Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday launched a scathing attack at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the ‘Naga accord’ even as he sought to woo voters for the upcoming Manipur Assembly Elections 2017. (ANI) \nCongress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday launched a scathing attack at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the ‘Naga accord’ even as he sought to woo voters for the upcoming Manipur Assembly Elections 2017. He claimed that even Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh was not taken into confidence before signing the agreement. Terming it as a ‘pre-paid’ accord, Rahul said ‘nobody knows about the accord.’ Elections will be held in 60 assembly seats in the state in two phase on March 4 and 8. Rahul’s comment comes after PM Modi had accused the Congress government in Manipur of spreading false propaganda on the Naga accord and said there was nothing in it that was detrimental to the interests of the state. \n“I assure you that there is no single reference of ditching Manipur people or their interests in the Naga Accord,” he said at an election meeting here. The O Ibobi Singh government was carrying on “false campaign and misleading the people regarding the Naga Accord,” he had alleged. \nWatch this video \n“The Naga Accord was signed one-and-half years ago. What were you doing? Were you in a deep sleep? All of a sudden you have woken up before elections. You are making false claims to mislead the people,” the prime minister said. The Congress government in the state has alleged that the details of the agreement have been kept “secret” as it “compromises the territorial integrity of Manipur.” \nThe Naga Peace Accord, termed a ‘framework agreement’, was signed between National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and the Centre in August 2015. The signing of the agreement came after over 80 rounds of negotiations that spanned 18 years with the first breakthrough in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed. \nA total of 54 crorepati candidates are in the fray for the first phase of Manipur Assembly elections to be held on March 4, while 8 have declared criminal cases against themselves, as per a latest report. \nManipur Election Watch and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) have analysed the self-sworn affidavits of all 167 candidates from 17 political parties, including 6 national parties, 5 state parties, 6 unrecognised parties and 14 independent candidates who are contesting in the first phase of Manipur assembly elections.
