They'd highlighted what appear to be a couple of intriguing objects in the reflection of his iris.\nFirst, here's another look at the eye, which flashes up at the end of the promo.\n\nNotice anything?\nImage: youtube/ gameofthrones \nNow let's go in for a close-up. \nWhat's that thing that looks like a ridge? And that cave-like dark splodge on the right?\nImage: youtube/ gameofthrones /mashable composite\nCloser! \nCould it be...?\nImage: youtube/ gameofthrones /mashable composite\nFacelessGreen highlighted a few different areas in his Imgur post , but we've picked out the two most interesting shapes in the image above.\nIt's impossible to be sure, but the line running right from the top of the Night's King's pupil does sort of resemble the top of the wall.\nAnd the dark, cave-like shape on the right? Well this is probably clutching at straws, but maybe — just maybe — it's actually a giant crack.\n\nWhat are those ghostly shapes?\nImage: youtube/ gameofthrones /mashable composite\nOn the left of the iris, meanwhile, are three human shares. Maybe some fellow White Walkers, gathered round to watch some sort of big event?\nPut all those elements together and there's the tiniest, tiniest possibility that what we're actually witnessing is the Night's King looking on as the wall begins to come tumbling down.\nAre we reading into this too much? Probably.\nBut with three-and-a-half months still to wait until Season 7 comes out, we've got to fill our time somehow.\nWATCH: Natalie Dormer reveals what it's like to be killed off on 'Game of Thrones'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:10:11.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
