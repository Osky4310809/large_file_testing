Gbemiga Olamikan. \nThe report also harped on the financial liquidity of the insurance industry as evidenced in underwriting business and individual risks gross premium income (GPI) of N356 billion generated by the sector in 2016, reflecting a 10 percent growth over 2015. \nIt said that 28 percent of the Industry’s GPI was paid out as claims in 2016, helping businesses and individuals recover from losses quickly. \nThe report also stated: “Insurance density rate which measures GPI as a proportion of population is $8.3 compared to Kenya’s $36.4 and South Africa’s $970.8. Going forward, evolving risks such as job losses, cyber risks among others will offer prospects for the development of new insurance products.” \n“We expect increased investments in government securities in 2017 as Insurers take advantage on higher interest rates. \n“In 2017, we project a moderated growth rate of 8 percent on account of the recession which is expected to have significant impact on major business lines. \n“The Industry’s regulatory environment is likely to change in the near term in response to the current macroeconomic climate. Regulators are beginning to emphasize risk profiles of insurance companies as against amount of capital held. \n“The proposed Risk Based Supervision Framework which is expected to be implemented in the near term will prompt reviews of business strategies. As a result, we foresee mergers and acquisitions in the Industry as well as foreign direct investments in the near term. “Another regulation that will shape operations in the Insurance Industry is the Bancassurance Guidelines which has received significant attention from regulators in recent times. \n“The competitive landscape remains intense across major business lines such as motor, fire, general accidents, oil & gas and life insurance.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:08:23.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
