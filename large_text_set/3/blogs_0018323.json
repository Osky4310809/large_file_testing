He's owned an Apple Watch for a few months and was disappointed with a lack of content for the tiny device. So he made his own game for it called Saqqara , but that still wasn't enough, so he set about making a Game Boy Color emulator run on Apple's smallest gadget. \nGabriel succeeded , but not without a lot of hard work and head scratching along the way. The biggest obstacle to any graphically-intensive software running on Apple Watch is a lack of support for the OpenGL or Metal graphics APIs within watchOS. Instead, Gabriel ended up relying on Core Graphics meant for \"lightweight 2D rendering,\" and some pixel buffer experimentation. \nThe end result is the Gambatte open source Game Boy Color emulator ported and running on a Series 2 Apple Watch . Gabriel decided to name his emulator Giovanni after the super-villain from his favorite Pokemon game: Pokemon Yellow. Related Dolphin Emulator Can Buy Wii Shop Games \nGiovanni runs games, but not well due to the limited processing power offered by an Apple Watch and the lack of support for a low-level graphics library. However, the fact it runs is the most important achievement and it even accepts the full range of user input expected by a Game Boy game. The D-Pad is mapped to swipes on the screen, tapping the screen represents A button input, and B, Start, and Select are virtual button options. The digital crown is also functional as a way of scrolling lists. \nThe image above is of Pokemon Yellow running on Giovanni. But don't think Gabriel is done with this project. He isn't happy with low frame rate and wants to improve it. That requires better hardware, though, so he's waiting for the next generation of Apple Watch hardware to be announced and hoping Apple adds support for Metal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:35:08.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
