Suffixes like -ify, -ster, or -ly added to words; think: Spotify , Napster or Contently . Vowels-are-overrated names; think: Flickr or Stringr . Intentional misspelling of a word (beyond just eliminating vowels—i’s become y’s, c’s become k’s or q’s, etc.); think: Lyft , Rubrik or Proov . \n“I used to try to be very clever about naming my startup… [Now], simply think about a real word that describes the service or a key feature of the service the startup will provide. This is how I arrived at the name Buffer.”– Joel Gascoigne, Buffer CEO \nThere are benefits and drawbacks to each of these naming trends, especially when it comes to the logistics of establishing the company online, which we’ll address more in depth later in this article. Overall, the level of simplicity and domain availability are in reverse correlation, so you should be careful to strike a balance. \nLastly, you shouldn’t feel restricted to these formats. Many of my favorite company names don’t fall neatly under any of these categories, such as TheRealReal (The same word twice, really? Yet it works.), Robinhood (Will people take you seriously? Yes.), x.ai (What is that? Exactly.) and of course, my own startup day100 (A word and a number in the name? Yep, and we got a cool meaning behind it). Long live suffixes. Via Bo_Rad for bruno.m. The mashup. Via ludibes. The one-word punch. Via Ian Douglas for Rhshaner \nSo consider these trends not as limitations but as handy examples while you think through variations or combinations of the names you come up with in the next step. Step 3: Develop Confused goat by bboyren \nNow we’re getting to the fun part: developing ideas, or brainstorming. Here’s a few tips on how to tackle this without going into semantic satiation (the fun phenomenon when repeating a word too many times makes it lose meaning) or getting buried in post-it notes (although I’ll tell you upfront, there’ll be a lot of ‘em): Quantity, not quality. Yes, you read that right. Unlike most things in life, this isn’t about nailing down the perfect name right away, but about generating a lot of ideas that can build on each other. Teamwork makes the dreamwork. You can certainly do a lot of brainstorming by yourself, but fresh perspectives can be very helpful and surprising. So if you can, pull in other people and create a brainstorming environment where people feel comfortable in sharing wild ideas and judgment is deferred. Get visual. As Tom and David Kelley say in their book Creative Confidence, a leader should never hesitate to reach for a marker. So don’t just write, but also draw up your ideas. Sketch badly; it’s not about artistry, but about getting the point across. The images can inspire the name, and as a bonus, now you also have a vision for your company logo. \n“[We] had two requirements for the name: we wanted a three letter word that started with a “W” and something that was easy to remember.”– Wix Play games. A brainstorming session where you just sit down and write a bunch of names in stream-of-consciousness style is not going to last long. Make it fun and more productive by integrating exercises and challenges. We’ve got you covered: check out our booklet for brainstorming exercises. Cheat a little. You don’t have to come up with every name by yourself or with a team. Leverage Thesaurus for synonyms of relevant keywords, and naming tools like Naminum and Namemesh for a wide range of name variations based on a keyword. Iterate. Of course, the golden rule of startups applies here too. Take a break (or a walk or a nap) and go through the brainstorming exercise again, then again. Try to vary your surroundings to promote a different creative process. If it’s a group effort, try it out with different groups, such as team members, friends, future users, etc. and different group sizes. Step 4: Deliver \nYour brainstorm session(s) probably yielded hundreds of naming ideas. Now it’s time to gather all the scraps of paper, sticky notes and doodles in front of you and start to narrow down. Strike the “meh” ideas out \nHere’s how to: First, group them according to similarities (e.g. same root word) and eliminate any doubles. Second, eliminate those that are semantically too complex and would be very cumbersome to spell/type. Believe me, you don’t want to miss out on sales opportunities down the line because the sales lead couldn’t spell your company name and therefore couldn’t reach you online. Chock-full of good ideas. Via HBO. Third, try to say them out loud. Are they easy to say? And do they sound funny? Don’t be the Silicon Valley show bunch who came up with SMLLR, aiming for “smaller”, then realized it could also be read as “smeller”. Fourth, test this with other people; preferably people who are unfamiliar with what you do. Ask them about their initial impressions of the name: how it sounds to them and what it makes them feel like. See how this compares to the company values and mission that you outlined at the very beginning of the process. Check availability of shortlisted names \nNow that you have a shortlist of names, you have to check if they’re actually usable. You need to verify not only the domain availability, but also of the relevant social media: Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram being the most popular. The free one-stop-shop for this is Namechk , which will automatically check for you the availability of each name you input on all possible platforms. \n“We knew we wanted a name that was easy to remember, approachable and friendly, but we didn’t want it to be a word that already existed. Dave [Rusenko, Weebly co-founder] actually built out an algorithm that would automatically generate available domain names based on rules such as length, the combination of consonants and vowels, and the .com being available. When we saw Weebly, we knew it was the winner.”– Dan Veltri, Weebly co-founder and CPO \nWhat if it’s not available? It happens more often than you’d think; in this day and age most domains, especially the simple ones, are long gone. Thankfully there’s options or creative tweaks if the exact name you’ve set your heart on isn’t readily available: Try a popular not-com domain. The most widespread alternative domain endings, especially with startups, are .co, .io, .net and the newly-trendy .xyz. You can easily check the availability of a whole bunch of domain endings on Namechk too. Get industry-specific. Some domain endings are better for some industries than for others: for instance, you can pick .cash for finance, .tech for technology, .shop for ecommerce and so forth. Check out a more comprehensive list . Get more creative. Have the domain ending play with your company name, e.g. companies like soul.camp and bonus.ly integrate the ending seamlessly into the name. Compromise. Look back at the trends and see if dropping a vowel or changing a consonant to its phonetic equivalent makes a difference. Is that a compromise you’re happy with? Unusual spellings. Via artsigma. The .co option. Via vraione. Test and decide \nOkay. You did the rough narrowing down, assessed people’s reactions to multiple options, checked the name availability, and now you’re down to your top two or three. How to go about that seemingly impossible task of picking one? \nI wanted to make up a new word for easy brand recognition and SEO purposes, and also wanted it to be easy to pronounce.– Bellgray \nIf your gut is not steadily pointing you to one direction, democratize the process. Sure, you can keep asking people personally, and while that’s a solid strategy in many ways, there will always be some bias and a limited sample size affecting the accuracy of that survey. \nInstead, take it online. Here are two ways of doing that: The hacker’s way: A/B test it, and let the numbers do the talking. You can do that by setting up identical landing pages and running targeted ads for your intended users/clients. Then compare traffic/engagement and pick the popular vote. The entrepreneurial blog StartupBros provides a great example . This is an excellent strategy because it comes as close to simulating real life as possible and you’re sure to make a data-driven decision. The social way: The process above may look a little daunting or unappealing to someone with minimal technical chops or someone who would rather not spend money in this effort. Cue the social way: asking your connections in your online social network. Chances are you have LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook, which for most professionals will easily amount to hundreds if not thousands of connections. Set up a short-and-sweet poll and share it with them. You can do that with free external polls such as Google Forms , which offer the convenience of having all results in one place and pre-analyzed for you. Alternatively, you can post the polls directly on the social media platforms, either by using their built-in polling tools (Twitter’s is free; Facebook’s is paid), or by simply posing a question and options in the form of a status. Granted, analyzing the data will involve some manual effort, but the response rate will probably be higher. Whichever way you choose, a hidden benefit of the social way is the marketing effect: you’re creating awareness about your company within your network and getting people excited that they get to have a say in your branding process. Go name your business! \nYoung grasshopper, you’re ready. These design thinking tips and the exercise booklet hopefully have supplemented the toolkit needed to come up with a creative, memorable, meaningful and available (!) name for your company. It’s work, I know, but after all you won’t get a second chance at the first impression, so it pays off to do it right.
