After proper arrangement, we struck and seized 860 bags of the smuggled rice, which we conveyed in two trucks to our Command. I recognise the support of the Kabesi of Itekun community, for ordering his subjects to all us perform our lawful duty. I appreciate the support of the Naval Commander, Commodore Dogo and his officers in making the seizure. My appreciation also goes to the Commanding officer, Col. Garba of Nigerian Army, Badagry for their swift response to back-up our operation”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T01:09:05.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
