La La Land – Linus Sandgren Silence – Rodrigo Prieto Moonlight – James Laxton \nWho will win? Given La La Land 's nearly unprecedented awards season sweep, we have to bet on Sandgren. However, Fraser took home the coveted ASC Award a week ago, most likely due to his innovative technical achievement on Lion. The Academy, traditionally less swayed by technical prowess in the Best Cinematography category, will likely opt for what its members deem the more \"visually stimulating\" choice. \nWatch Jacob T. Swinney's supercut of this year's Oscar-nominated cinematography below. \nWhen we tracked down the cameras used by this year's nominees , we found that productions were quite fond of ARRI: Arrival, Lion, Moonlight, Hell or High Water, Silence, and Manchester by the Sea shot on the ARRI Alexa XT. As for lenses, Angenieux Optimos were all the rage. \nStay tuned for our up-to-the-minute Oscars coverage this Sunday, starting at 8PM EST.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:58:56.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
