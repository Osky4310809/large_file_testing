In a tweet from the official PlayStation Ireland Twitter account today, Sony bluntly stated that the game will remain exclusive to PS4. You can see the image captured in this NeoGAF thread . Later on in the day, though, is where the story becomes interesting. \nThe original tweet has since been deleted and has been replaced with a different answer. According to Sony, Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy is simply coming to PS4 and PS4 Pro first.   will launch on 30th June 2017. To clarify our earlier post, it will be coming to PlayStation 4 and PS4 Pro first. â€” PlayStation Ireland (@PlayStationIE) February 22, 2017 \nThat certainly doesn't sound very exclusive. What, exactly, is going on here? Is Activision planning on bringing the remaster to older hardware (a Vita release would be stellar), or will Crash be jumping onto the Xbox One and Switch? I know industry analyst Michael Pachter was having a problem associating the question blocks from Crash with Nintendo, but maybe he was onto something last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:38:17.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
