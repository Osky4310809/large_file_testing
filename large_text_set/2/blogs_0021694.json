Read Full Article \nOn \"Outnumbered\" today, Meghan McCain said the video made her \"wildly uncomfortable,\" because she hates seeing children being used for propaganda. \n\"This is despicable,\" she said. \"It's a really gross political trick. And it's really dirty and it's really low-brow.\" \nShe said she was surprised that NBC would put their name behind these \"disgusting\" videos, and she called for them to be removed immediately. \nHarris Faulkner agreed that it's \"disturbing,\" because these children are clearly too young to understand the actual facts. Judge Alex Ferrer noted that it appears obvious that the political messages were scripted for the children to read.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:09:21.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
