Kangaroos, lesser flamingos and now lappet-faced vultures have returned to their habitats at the Tree of Life , after being relocated during construction. To see these animals and more head to Disney’s Animal Kingdom for a day of exploration on the recently re-opened Discovery Island Trails . Here is a glimpse at some of the animals you may find on your adventure.\nIn front of the Tree of Life, you may see red kangaroos, lesser flamingos, white storks and lappet-faced vultures. \nTry to spot the red kangaroos jumping; they can leap up to 25 feet in a single bound! Find the Wilderness Explorer Troop Leader near the lesser flamingos to earn your Flamingo Badge. Look for the long orange legs of the white stork that help it wade in water to catch fish. Lappet-faced vultures can have a wingspan of up to nine feet. See if you can spot them displaying their wings. Near the Wilderness Explorer Club House , you may find ring-tailed lemurs hiding in the foliage. \n\nVisit the ring-tailed lemurs early to try and spot them “sunning” or warming up on cool mornings. They do this in a yoga-like gesture with their arms resting on their knees facing toward the sun. Behind the Tree of Life, see if you can spot the African crested porcupines, saddle-billed stork and Burmese black tortoises. \nTake a look at the quills of the African crested porcupines; they can grow up to 13 inches long. Listen for the saddle-billed stork communicating by rattling its bill. Burmese black tortoises are great to observe if you have young photographers as they have slow, deliberate movements. As you circle the tree discovering the animals that surround it, spend some time looking at the tree itself to see if you can spot the animals you have seen in the more than 300 animal carvings, and make sure to stay as the sun sets to see the animal spirits in the tree awaken approximately every 10 minutes.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T16:30:25.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
