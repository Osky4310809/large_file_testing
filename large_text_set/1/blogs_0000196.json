They can’t be bothered to buy a gift, they don’t like her that much, or they’re just not into romantic shit. Now, you really can’t help these guys… they’re assholes. \nThere are, however, good guys who are genuinely not keen on Valentine’s Day… perhaps they should be reminded of a few things . \nAs a man, it’s easy to ask the obvious, “Why do I need one day out of the year to show that I care about my girlfriend?” I think this is fair question to ask, especially if you’re the type of guy who puts a lot of effort into your relationship. \nIt’s also easy for a man to be apathetic about February 14 because some women will downplay their expectations on the day to avoid disappointment. She may say something like “Valentine’s Day is not that big of a deal to me”… and this does not help the situation . \nIn order for you to show that you care on Valentine’s Day, you really need to appreciate the significance of the day. You need to realize how important it is to most women, even those who feign nonchalance. \nBeing in a good relationship is like being a professional tennis player. You have to constantly play in tournaments for a number of reasons…but your focus is on the four major titles…the four Grand Slams. Similarly, when you’re in a relationship, you have to constantly take your girl out on dates but your focus should be on the four major date nights…the big four . \n1. Birthday 3. Anniversary 4. New Year’s Eve \nIn essence, Valentine’s Day is equivalent to the other three important annual events and should be treated with the same level of enthusiasm. Now, every woman is different, so some may give more weight to the other dates…just as a tennis player may prefer a particular Grand Slam…but the fact remains that V-day is very important. \nFor a second, recall asking your girl out on a date for the first time. You probably didn’t have the balls to call her, so you sent her a text or an email and then anxiously waited for a response. When she replied, your reaction wasn’t exactly thug-like. So, perhaps you’re not as macho as you think you are. In other words, you definitely have it in you to do something romantic. \nWe can all agree that men like to be challenged because it’s healthy for our egos. Why not adopt that mindset when it comes to Valentine’s Day? You should give it your best shot to make it an unforgettable day. This, of course, requires you to be very creative and this, of course, requires sacrifice. But it’s definitely worth it when after a day filled with surprises, laughter and nostalgia, you get to draw closer, put your arms around her and kiss her lips. \nFor all the Ladies reading this article, please note that when I made the tennis analogy, you should know that it applies to Mixed Doubles as well. You have to understand that if you want to make the day a memorable one, you need to make him feel special too. Valentine’s Day is hard work, but people don’t usually appreciate things that come easy—except a free ticket to a party, maybe.
