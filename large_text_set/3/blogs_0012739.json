The former US president slipped quietly into Tahiti by private jet yesterday, touching down at Faa’a International Airport near the capital of Papeete at about 3.30pm. He is expected to stay in French Polynesia for the next month, but his initial visit to Tahiti was a short one.

Formerly the Tahitian royal family's favourite retreat, Tetiaroa later became the home of legendary actor Marlon Brando, who bought parts of the idyllic atoll in the 1960s. \nMore recently, it has charmed Hollywood royalty such as Leonardo DiCaprio, who celebrated his birthday at The Brando in November 2016. Voted \"Best Resort in the World\" by Condé Nast Traveler readers last year, The Brando is powered by solar energy and coconut oil, cooled by a sea water air conditioning system, and home to an innovative mosquito eradication project involving researchers from Oxford University.

He is expected to visit some of the other islands in French Polynesia, including honeymoon hotspot Bora Bora, during his stay. \nLocally, there is also speculation that he will spend time on his friend, billionaire film producer David Geffen’s $300-million yacht, which was moored in Papeete earlier this week and is now off the coast of neighbouring island Moorea. \nDreamworks founder Mr Geffen has been a big supporter of Mr Obama over the years, throwing the first big Hollywood fundraiser in support of his 2008 run for presidency. It is not known whether Michelle Obama will join her husband during his stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T14:12:43.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
