He has reportedly visited the country only four times and made clear in his application that he did not intend to live there. \n“I am happy to say categorically that I have found no other country that aligns more with my view of the future than New Zealand,” he wrote.

This included his donation to the relief effort after the deadly 2011 quake. \nMr Thiel, a German-born United States citizen, broke with many of his technology mogul counterparts by staunchly supporting Mr Trump. He donated more than $US1 million to Mr Trump’s campaign and is now an adviser to the new President. \nIt is not precisely clear why Mr Thiel sought citizenship in New Zealand. Some have speculated that he was seeking a doomsday refuge in the event of catastrophe or mass unrest. \nDetails of his new nationality emerged after local media discovered that he had bought a 193-hectare waterfront estate on Lake Wanaka, near Queenstown.
