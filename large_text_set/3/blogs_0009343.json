This drizzly Friday morning was no different. Kids from Skyline High School's culinary program, lined single file, ooh 'd and aah 'd their way across the farm. Most had never seen goats or chickens in person; or, for that matter, greens sprouting from the dirt in straight, bright lines. \nThere was another young boy on the farm, too, tagging along but at a distance. His name is Mike, and he is no stranger to Bonton Farms. When asked, he couldn't remember the first time he came to the farm. Maybe a couple of months ago? But he was quick to answer when asked about his favorite part of farm life. \n\"The goats,\" said the 11-year-old with the towering blonde-tinted frohawk, a wide smile and sharp eyes. \"I like the goats. They like to rub up on me. It just feels weird to me. It tickles.\" South Dallas' Bonton farm ministry is growing \nWhen he's not walking among the goats, in socks and rubber sandals not meant for trekking through compost and muck, he's taking care of the greens. The boy, lanky and sagacious, loves broccoli. \nBut let's be clear: Mike should not have been at Bonton Farms on this weekday morning. He was not on a field trip or spring break. Truth is, he has not been to school since December, when, he said, he attended a Richardson ISD elementary near his old apartment at Royal Lane and Audelia Road. He said he's been a straight-A student since pre-K all the way through fifth grade. \n\"I was anti-social, so of course I liked to study,\" Mike said, grinning. He likes school; science and math classes, especially. He'd like to get back to class. But he doesn't know when that will happen.

(Andy Jacobsohn/The Dallas Morning News) \nMike is the child who Bonton Farms' executive director Daron Babock was referring to Thursday when he posted to Facebook a cry for help . In a post shared, liked and commented on dozens of times, Babcock beseeched friends to donate whatever they could spare for the kid who \"only has the clothes on his back.\" Babcock wrote that Mike's father is essentially out of the picture, and that his mother is \"going through her own battles.\" He said the boy \"shows up at the farm, and we are grateful to do what we can to offer him love and support.\" \nI saw several friends passing around Babcock's note, along with comments that they were coming to drop off supplies and gift cards. We hear, more and more, about the lost children of the city; just Thursday, we were reminded of the escalating number of lost children in this rich city who go without food, homes, families. Here was one rescued, if for a moment, by the farmers who live around the corner. \nBabcock, sitting at the farm Friday, said Mike is but one in a long line of children who've discovered the light at the dead-end of Bexar Street minutes south of downtown. He said more than 120 kids have been regulars since the first seeds were planted about three years ago. Some were pre-schoolers who walked through the gates carrying sisters and brothers still in diapers; others were in high school, looking for something to fill empty hours and empty bellies. As Dallas ISD's homeless student population reaches 'catastrophic' numbers, a plea and a proposal \nBabcock, the former college wrestler and corporate recruiter who moved from Frisco into a Habitat for Humanity house a block from the southern Dallas farm, said many have been kicked out of their nearby Section 8 housing by single parents. Maybe they could no longer afford to feed their kids; maybe they just didn't want to bother being parents any longer. It's the same story Dallas ISD's homeless-student coordinator told me a few weeks ago when he warned of the catastrophic uptick in the number of kids who don't know where they will sleep tonight: The city's population of homeless children is on the rise because they're seen as a liability by their own parents. \n\"The thing is, you have all this ...\" Babcock paused. \" Brokenness . These kids raise themselves. But you'd be amazed at the talent in these kids, the potential, the personality, the hope .\" \nBefore Mike, Babcock said, there was Memphis, who lived with Babcock and his wife for about a year. His mom was living in a hot-sheet motel; she was only too happy to let Babcock watch her baby boy, because better him than her. About once a year, he figured, he'll write Facebook messages like the one he posted Thursday. \n\"It gets to the point when we're stretched thin,\" he said. \nAt the moment Mike is staying with Patrick Wright, Bonton Farms' 49-year-old manager, because his mom is trying to get her life back on track. She just got a job at a fried-chicken restaurant near Fair Park. But for years she's been bouncing from place to place, staying with a sister or her mom, anywhere there's a bed and a roof. Her 11-year-old son said she's trying to sort through her own issues -- \"she doesn't like to live by anyone else's rules.\" \nMike, who has a brother and sister, said he might see his dad every so often, but Wright says father and son have little interaction. So with the permission of Mike's mother, who Wright dated for a couple of years beginning when Mike was 4, he will watch the 11-year-old as long as he has to. The hope is Mike and his mom can find peace under one roof soon. \n\"That's best for everybody,\" Babcock said. \"Mike will never thrive as long as mom's struggling. And we hope to get her the help she needs.\" In this photo from 2015, Patrick Wright, Bonton Farms' manager, prepares to leave his vehicle before feeding the new baby goats, Anna and Sydney, with his daughter, Jessie Smith. (Andy Jacobsohn/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nBabcock said if Mike were in danger, or if his mother wasn't desperately trying to turn her life around, they would of course call the authorities. But this is just a way to \"bridge the gap,\" he said, giving everybody time to take a deep breath so a young boy can find his way back to school and some semblance of normalcy. \n\"From time to time we all find ourselves in a bind,\" Babcock said. \"If you got in trouble somehow, you have people to call you can trust and depend on to see you through that pickle. Poor people don't have that support system, so when crisis hits for them, what we want to do is be in a position where the know they can depend on us to help them -- not forever, but while they go though that.\" \nWright said he has his reasons for watching over Mike, starting with the fact he'd \"messed up a whole bunch of years.\" Wright did some time for drug-related crimes; he, like many others, found redemption amidst the calm of the farm. \n\"I was a society reject,\" Wright said. He said he won't let that happen to Mike. \"He's a young kid who deserves a better life,\" Wright said. \"I love him.\" \nWright is watching the boy so, \"hopefully, I can put a smile on God's face.\" Mike walks with farm dog Moses, right, and Cruz, left, at Bonton Farms on Friday (Andy Jacobsohn/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nMike is not yet one of the lost, the hopeless; far from it. For now, at least, the bouncing around is just a part of life he takes in stride. He said he likes it, kind of: \"I get to make a lot of friends.\" He said if he were to write a book about his life, it would be titled Fun . \nBecause it should be. He's 11, for God's sakes. \n\"The people here are no different than in any other part of town,\" Babcock said. \"They're just stronger than you.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T19:08:19.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
