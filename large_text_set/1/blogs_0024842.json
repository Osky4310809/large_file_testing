In Sweden for example, the Volkswagen Golf was the most popular new car in 2016 - the first time in more than half a century that a Volvo hadn't topped the country's sales. \nToyota's sales grew by 0.2% - though it appears to have suffered from a slowdown in the US car industry. \nGeneral Motors reports its figures next week, but it is expected to lag both the Japanese and the German firms. \nGM was the world's third-largest carmaker in 2015. It held the number one title in 2011 after Toyota's production was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami in north-eastern Japan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T11:03:25.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
