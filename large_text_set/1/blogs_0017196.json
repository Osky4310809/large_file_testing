We had the match in our hands. \n\"I'm getting used to English football. Everything can happen from what we saw today. The speed is different from Brazilian football. I must adapt as quick as I can to do well. \n\"It was very important for me to come on tonight, to have this confidence from my team-mates and my coach. Unfortunately, I was offside [for the disallowed goal]. I started celebrating while the whole stadium was in silence. \n\"But it's a dream come true to play in the Premier League.\" \nCity had led Spurs 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium, with goals from Leroy Sane and Kevin de Bruyne, but they were pegged back by Dele Alli and Son Heung-min as Guardiola's men remain fifth.
