But perhaps no longer.\nWebb, a member of the Annapolis class of ’68, brought a Navy Cross, a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts home with him from Vietnam, among other decorations. That was just the beginning.\nHis Marine Corps career cut short by war wounds, Webb continued his service to America both as secretary of the Navy and as US senator from Virginia. And he authored 10 books — among them a riveting novel of combat in Southeast Asia and a history of the enduringly pugnacious Scots-Irish in America, “Born Fighting.”\nWebb, himself Scots-Irish, has been a fighter all his life. But this week, he took a knee — understandably but regrettably surrendering to the know-nothingism that has been choking off reasoned political discourse on college campuses and elsewhere across the country for far too long.\nThink of it as Jim Webb vs. the hecklers’ veto — and the hecklers won. \nWebb was to have been honored Friday as a “distinguished graduate” by the Naval Academy Alumni Association, but withdrew Tuesday evening: “I am being told that my presence at the ceremony would likely mar the otherwise celebratory nature of that special day. As a consequence, I find it necessary to decline the award.”\nBetter he should have spit in somebody’s eye — but once an officer and a gentleman, always an officer and a gentleman, one supposes.\nAt issue was a paper he wrote in 1979 objecting to the admission of women to the nation’s military academies on the even-then-unfashionable, but still-not-unreasonable, grounds that assignment of women to frontline combat roles is at best disruptive, and at worst dangerous. Perhaps lethally so.\nWebb could have been dead wrong about all of it, of course, even if 40 years of experience with gender integration strongly indicates otherwise. The Navy’s ongoing shipboard pregnancy epidemic and the difficulty most women have coping with traditional infantry-training standards suggests that the debate is far from settled.\nUnless dissent can be beaten into the ground, of course — along with those who refuse to accept that political equity can trump basic biology without serious consequences. \nWebb demurred early on, and it’s hard to imagine someone with greater personal standing to do so. Now he’s paying a price, if a small one — another plaque for the wall — and certainly he’ll survive.\nBut it’s not clear that such can be said with certainty about honorable military service in defense of fundamental principles. Not over the long haul.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:36:18.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
