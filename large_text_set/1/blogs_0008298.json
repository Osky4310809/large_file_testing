Despite a phenomenal goals ration for City Guardiola is reluctant to start him (Photo: Reuters) Iheanacho scores the second goal for City at Hull on Boxing Day (Photo: Reuters) \nHowever, Goater, who played for City for five years until leaving in 2003, believes that privately City's boss does not rate him as highly as he says publicly. \nHe told sports.bwin.com : \"I’m a massive believer in what a manager does rather than what he says and I’m sure he thinks and says that Kelechi is a great young talent but Guardiola’s actions make it clear that he doesn’t believe he’s good enough. \n\"You can’t bring him on with very little time to go to score a goal. \n\"He obviously doesn’t have confidence in him to play him alongside Aguero more regularly if things aren’t going right.
