We received almost $8,000 in February from 412 people. Many thanks to my fellow developers also and to our partners, it‚Äôs a real pleasure to be working with you all. \nMintBox Mini Pro and Airtop \nOur first impressions of the Mini Pro and the Airtop were right. \nA detailed preview of these two computers was posted on Segfault at http://segfault.linuxmint.com/2017/03/mintbox-mini-pro-airtop-preview/ . \nI was very impressed with them. Compulab computers have always felt unique and they‚Äôve always been completely silent, but this is the first time one of them is that powerful! \nIt triggered some changes in the office üôÇ \nXreader \nThe PDF and document reader, Xreader, is receiving many changes at the moment. \nWithin the development team, Joseph Mccullar is reviewing its user interface and revamping its sidebar and toolbar. \nThe application will support dark themes and symbolic icons and new buttons will be added in the toolbar to quickly switch between different view modes. \nPeter Moser is fixing many bugs and porting some changes from Atril and Evince. \nThe application also received touch support. If you‚Äôre equipped with a touch screen you‚Äôll be able to zoom by pinching the document or go to the next/previous page by swiping your finger. \nUpdate Manager \nWe‚Äôre improving the Update Manager again. \nIt still has the same mission and tackles the same issues (keeping your computer safe, providing bug fixes and protecting you from regressions) but it will present things differently. \nLevels will be refined to better filter updates depending on their level of impact on the operating system and without worrying about their origin. Most updates will be level 2. Application updates which do not impact the OS will be level 1. Tookits and desktop environments or libraries which affect multiple applications will be level 3. Kernels and sensitive system updates will be level 4. As for level 5 it will be very rare (no updates qualify in there yet and none should unless something goes very wrong upstream) and it will be dedicated to non-recommended broken/dangerous updates. \nThe Manager will insist on staging and reviewing updates depending on their level. The notion of updates vs regression is central and these core concepts need to be understood by users, but presenting them without enough guidance leads to indecision and incomprehension. We‚Äôve seen bloggers and Debian developers alike completely miss the point on this, so we had to present things differently and make things simpler by adding explicit recommendations here and there for users to make an actual strategy. \nA large help section will be shipped with the Update Manager. It will go much more into details than before to make sure core concepts are well understood by users. What are updates? What are regressions? What are the different types of updates? How important are they? What are levels and policies? etc etc‚Ä¶ \nRegressions will be presented as an inherent aspect of development rather than something users should be scared about. The idea is to contain the regression, to understand what it can affect before experiencing it and to be prepared to tackle it, more so than to avoid it. Levels and policies will be presented in a way that guide users to apply safe updates often, but to review and to apply sensitive updates individually. \nUsers will be given more information on how to find help, how to distinguish between mandatory and optional updates, security patches and bug fixes. \nMore information will also be given on kernels and security updates and we will insist on the importance of security. There are a few developers and fanboys out there who are working very hard on giving us the reputation of an unsafe operating system and which recommend our users switch to a distribution which gives no information about regressions and which has been hacked twice as much as ours. It has to stop obviously and so although it is pretty obvious, we will state how important security is, black on white for everyone to see. \nDespite a few cosmetic bugs highlighted by Ubuntu‚Äôs recent misstep on kernel 4.4.0-67, kernel updates management worked really well in 18.1. The documentation related to kernels will be improved though. We‚Äôll make it clearer how to force grub to appear, how to select a kernel, how to check drivers and DKMS status, and how to remove the kernel you‚Äôre currently using. \nLast but not least, advanced Linux users will be able to automate updates by writing scripts, routines or cron jobs thanks to a new CLI called ‚Äúmintupdate-tool‚Äù. This tool will support all the features present in the Update Manager including level selection, security updates, kernel updates, blacklisting, and it will let you list and/or apply updates. \nDisplay Manager \nLinux Mint 18.2 could ship with LightDM and unity-greeter by default. \nWe‚Äôve been testing this display manager as an alternative to MDM and adding support where it was missing and the results are promising. \nWe‚Äôve been developing a tool called lightdm-settings to make it more easily configurable: \nThe end result isn‚Äôt as full-featured, as configurable or themeable as MDM but it looks quite nice. \nLightDM brings a feature which we support in Cinnamon already, but which isn‚Äôt present with MDM: The ability to open guest-sessions (i.e. if enabled, a guest can log in, his/her user account is created on the fly, no data is saved persistently and everything is gone when he/she logs out). \nLightDM‚Äôs code and design are modern, its greeter uses modern toolkits and interactions between the greeter and the daemon are much simpler than in MDM. \nJust like PulseAudio or Systemd, it‚Äôs also a component which has become standard in most Linux distributions. \nUbuntu hardcodes references to LightDM in many places so it also simplifies maintenance and troubleshooting if Linux Mint aligns itself on the display manager (MDM does not work in Ubuntu for instance, due to these hardcoded references and requires patches to integrate it properly with Plymouth, Upstart, NVIDIA Prime, etc.. in Linux Mint). \nUnity-greeter is loosely tied to Unity, its scope is restricted to Ubuntu and it‚Äôs not compatible with Debian (which could be an issue long-term for LMDE). It wasn‚Äôt decided yet whether LMDE would continue to use MDM, or lightdm-gtk-greeter or if we were to produce a cross-distro version of unity-greeter. We‚Äôre still testing and integrating the OS around LightDM to make sure everything works well. \nOther news \nUbuntu and Linux Mint were mentioned briefly in Episode 18 of the new MacGyver series. It was short but it was funny. \nLinux Mint might be featured in the upcoming pilot episode of a popular American drama‚Äìthriller television series. We‚Äôre very excited about it and we can‚Äôt wait to see it happen. More on this when it does üôÇ \nWe‚Äôre talking to a manufacturer and considering a partnership on the production of a premium quality laptop. Just like the MintBox, we‚Äôre interested in producing something unique that people will love. Again, I can‚Äôt say too much before it actually happens, but we‚Äôre excited about this as well üôÇ \nNetflix now works out of the box in Linux with Firefox. Thanks to Mozilla for implementing the necessary DRM support (that actually happened a long time ago) and to Netflix for not blocking Firefox anymore. \nLast but not least, we finally purchased a Wacom device in order to fix some of the bugs related to graphics tablets. I‚Äôd like to thank Wacom users for their patience. Sorry it took us so long. We‚Äôll be tackling these bugs very soon now and improving Wacom support going forward. \nSponsorships: \nLinux Mint is proudly sponsored by: Platinum Sponsors:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:19:46.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
