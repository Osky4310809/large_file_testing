But that doesn't make make this any less of a good time to reflect on some of the greatest iterations of the beloved Man of Steel. Here are the eight greatest versions of Superman. Christopher Reeve \nStill considered the quintessential Superman, Christopher Reeve’s soothing take on Superman was both definitive for the character and for cinema. The Fleischer Brothers \nThe Fleischer Brothers’ warm rotoscoped version of the hero was simple, but gave us great and far reaching adventures. It remains one of the best versions of the character. George Reeves \nGeorge Reeves played a warm and fatherly Superman who charmed and entertained audiences throughout the 1950s on TV's Adventures of Superman . Superman: The Animated Series \nIn a sense, the Bruce Timm-designed Superman of Superman: The Animated Series is the definitive animated version of Superman. This character also went on to star in Justice League and Justice League Unlimited . All-Star Superman \nGrant Morrison’s version of Superman as a kind figure of warmth in an often weird world became one of the most iconic portrayal of the superhero when \"All Star Superman\" came out with its first issue in 2004. Calvin Ellis \n(source) \nCalvin Ellis is an African American Superman based on Barack Obama who played a role in Grant Morrison’s \"Final Crisis\". He’s one of Grant Morrison’s greatest creations, and since his debut, has been popping up in many universe-hopping stories in the DC Universe. Siegel and Shuster’s Superman \nThe first Superman, as portrayed by his creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, set the pace for not just Superman, but all superheroes. An absolute classic. \nWhich versions of Superman do you like best?
