This is just one other prong in what we can do,” he told BuzzFeed. \nThose who can’t make it all the way to New York can perform the spell at home alone or with their coven – as long as it’s within a “cleansed area.” witchcraft brothers and sisters: remember to perform the binding ritual in a cleansed area! you do not want bad energy negating the spell!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:58:23.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
