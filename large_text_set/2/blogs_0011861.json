The world’s first migratory \"Bird Airport\" is designe to convert a landfill in Lingang, China into a wetland bird sanctuary \n\n\nEvery year, more than 50 million birds journey from the Antarctic along the East Asian-Australian Flyway (EAAF), but the route is increasingly threatened to due to coastal urbanization. Today, 1 in 5 globally endangered waterbirds fly this route as their population rapidly decreases.\n\nRelated: 1.5 billion birds disappear from North America’s skies \nTo address the problem, the Port of Tianjin called on international designers to create a wetland sanctuary for migrating birds. McGregor Coxall's Bird Airport includes 60 hectares of wetland park, where birds will be able to stop, refuel, and breed on their way through the flyway. Renewable energy will be used to irrigate the wetlands with recycled waste water and harvested rain.\n\nAdrian McGregor, CEO and lead designer of McGregor Coxall explains the inspiration behind the project, “The earth's bird flyways are a wonder of the natural world. The proposed Bird Airport will be a globally significant sanctuary for endangered migratory bird species whilst providing new green lungs for the city of Tianjin.\"\nThe city of Tianjin will enjoy many benefits from the new green infrastructure . The proposal calls for plenty of park space - including walking and cycling paths along a 7 km network of recreational urban forest trails. Construction on the bird airport is slated to begin late 2017, and the project will be completed in 2018.\n+ McGregor Coxall \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:01:04.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
