These include: rising volatility ; soaring short interest ; the falling dollar; and the S&P 500, which last week fell dangerously near its value-weighted average ( VWAP ) level for the year, according to Bloomberg . (See also: How to Make Sense of the Trump Rally .) Four Alarm Bells Ringing \nAfter the Trump Rally sent U.S. stocks soaring to their highest levels on record, recent weeks have seen a steady slide back to reality - even with the S&P 500's uptick on Tuesday - as investors fear that the president's economic and fiscal plans may not even see the light of day. After the new affordable healthcare act (\"Trumpcare\") failed to get past congress, investors are now concerned that other political measures, such as tax reform and trade negotiations, may also fall flat. There are four key indicators that highlight these growing concerns, according to Bloomberg's March 26 story. \n1- The S&P 500's decline to its 2017 volume-weighted average \nThe S&P 500 is still up 4.5% year-to-date as of Monday, but has given up 1.5% over the past thirty days. Bloomberg reports that a more important measure, however, is the volume-weighted average price, or VWAP. This accounts for the amount of shares that investors have purchased at each price, and when the VWAP goes negative on the year - even if the index itself remains in Bull territory, then investors on whole have lost money.

The dollar, which is also a predictor of overall U.S. economic health has declined sharply from those November highs. Falling below its 200-day moving average, trading momentum is now bearish and the dollar may continue its slide. \n3 - Rising volatility \nPrice volatility, or the magnitude of price swings has also been rising. The CBOE Volatility Index ( VIX ), sometimes referred to as the \"fear index,\" has spiked after being subdued for much of 2016. Volatility often spells fear since price swings grow larger in downturns amid panic selling and dip buying, and swings are less when markets are rising steadily in an orderly fashion. Rising volatility may therefore indicate that a bear market is on the horizon. \n4 - Soaring short interest \nShort interest is the relative proportion of shares of a company that have been borrowed in order to be sold short. As investors boost their short positions, betting that the market will go down, short interest increases. Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) has more than doubled so far in March, to 2.5%, according to data compiled by Markit.
