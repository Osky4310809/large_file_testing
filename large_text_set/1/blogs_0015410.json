Why would Obama forfeit Democrats’ momentary “we’re the party of national security!” messaging this way?\nThe decision by Mr. Obama rescued Ms. Manning, who twice tried to commit suicide last year, from an uncertain future as a transgender woman incarcerated at the male military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. She has been jailed for nearly seven years, and her 35-year sentence was by far the longest punishment ever imposed in the United States for a leak conviction.\nNow, under the terms of Mr. Obama’s commutation announced by the White House on Tuesday, Ms. Manning is set to be freed in five months, on May 17 of this year, rather than in 2045.\nThe commutation also relieved the Department of Defense of the difficult responsibility of her incarceration as she pushes for treatment for her gender dysphoria — including sex reassignment surgery — that the military has no experience providing.\nSean Davis extracts the lesson here: “Giving classified info to Wikileaks is good as long as it only endangers national security and not Democrat careers.”\nEd made the case a few days ago that, between the DNC and Podesta hackings and Manning’s massive, unprecedented document dump, it was the latter that likely pleased Russia more by embarrassing the United States abroad and leaving the White House scrambling to clean up the mess diplomatically . Either Obama designed this as some outgoing pander to his LGBT base, on the theory that someone who was in turmoil over his gender somehow can’t be blamed for coping by handing hundreds of thousands of U.S. documents to Russian ally Julian Assange, or … there’s a deal in the works. Is there?\nIf Obama grants Manning clemency Assange will agree to US extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case https://t.co/MZU30SlfGK \n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 12, 2017 \n\nJazz flagged that tweet the other day and wondered what possible deal could be in the offing. I’m wondering the same thing. Even if Assange keeps his promise and surrenders, why the hell would Obama want Assange’s fate in the hands of Trump? Trump spent the final month of the campaign name-checking Wikileaks practically every day on the trail as they leaked Podesta’s emails. His number-one fan, Sean Hannity, later thanked Assange with a fawning interview from the Ecuadorean embassy. Trump cited Assange’s claims that Russia didn’t give him the Podesta emails to counter the CIA’s assessment two weeks ago, and Assange has repaid the kindness by criticizing Obama for trying to delegitimize Trump’s victory . It’s a love-in all around. There’s no way Assange gets a stiff sentence from the Trump administration, even in the unlikely event that he gives himself up.\nOr is that the point? Obama’s been trying to box in Trump in all sorts of ways since the election, most recently by ending the “wet foot, dry foot” policy on Cuba. Maybe calling Assange’s bluff about giving himself up if Manning’s sentence was commuted is another way. If Assange surrenders, Trump will be stuck having to decide whether to throw the book at him, which will piss off all the Trumpers who admire him for his help in the great victory, or to let him go as thanks for his election help, which will piss off everyone else insofar as it constitute a quid pro quo for laundering hacked material obtained by Russia to try to tilt the election. It’d be a dilemma. Although Trump could always go the Obama route, I guess — prosecute Assange, hit him with a heavy sentence, and then commute his time later when people are paying less attention. That might send the IC into even more of a rage than Manning’s commutation will. Although it’s a high bar.\nExit quotation via Drew McCoy : “Edward Snowden should really consider announcing he’s going to undergo gender reassignment surgery ASAP.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:31:55.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
