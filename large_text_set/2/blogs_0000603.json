I think it’s a little more than minor. My whole life changed. I have two beautiful granddaughters I can no longer run around with,” said Sandy LaPlante. “It’s a struggle every day no matter what I do.” \nDe Blasio made the remarks on CNN, defending New York as a sanctuary city and his policy of protecting immigrants who commit “very minor” offenses from deportation. He was asked if grand larceny or drunken driving is a “very minor” offense. \n“Drunk driving that does not lead to any other negative outcome, I could define as that,” de Blasio responded. \nThe city does have a list of 170 offenses where it will turn offenders over, including menacing a police officer, vehicular assault, rape and murder. Driving while intoxicated and driving while impaired are not on the list. \nIn Albany on Tuesday, the mayor was questioned about the other omissions from the list. \n“Sexual misconduct, forcible touching, sexual abuse in the second or third degree, grand larceny, welfare fraud, identity theft,” said state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis (R-Brooklyn), reading off offenses that are absent from the list. \n“When you come up with a list of 170 offenses, if there are a several more that should be included, I’m perfectly happy to include them,” de Blasio said. \nAdvocates said DWI should be on the list. \n“I would like to see what he would say if one of his family members was in the position I’m in right now,” LaPlante said. \nCBS2’s Kramer asked City Hall if drunken driving and driving while impaired would be added to the list of offenses meriting deportation. A spokeswoman said it will be the subject of “thoughtful attention and conversation.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T09:05:29.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
