Seeing scary movies with friends is 100 percent necessary. And nobody knows this better than Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, who watched Get Out together yesterday. \nChris and Bryce — along with other members of the Jurassic World 2 cast — are currently filming in the UK, and were bummed that Jordan Peele’s hit horror movie hadn’t been released across the pond yet. But Universal heard their cries and set up a private screening for them, so they could watch the twisty-turny thriller on the big screen before spoilers made their way to the internet.\nLuckily, Chris documented the whole thing on Instagram, so we can basically pretend we were there. According to the video he posted on Instagram, Chris, Bryce, and co-star Daniella Pineda are SUPER excited for Get Out .\n#GetOut to the theatre and see #GetOut push it over $100M! Thanks Universal for the private screening in the U.K. So excited!!!! Good job @jordanpeele @standup4justice @brycedhoward @therealmiddlefinger @filmbayona \nA post shared by chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) on Mar 11, 2017 at 11:37am PST \nBryce also shared a photo of the Jurassic World 2 family all snuggled into the theater. But there’s noticeably some popcorn missing, guys!\n#jurassicworld2 Family Movie Night! \"Get Out\"--insane. Amazing job @JordanPeele and @UniversalPics pic.twitter.com/hrlHWuvxwM \n— Bryce Dallas Howard (@BryceDHoward) March 11, 2017 Afterward, Chris posted a video of everyone’s reactions while the credits were still rolling. A post shared by chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) on Mar 11, 2017 at 1:32pm PST \nAnd it looks like they were as mindblown as us at the end.\nDaniella Pineda also shared this photo of the crew giving their best scared-y faces beforehand.\n#getout NOW!!!! Like GET OUT AND SEE THIS FUCKING MOVIE ALREADY. @JordanPeele @prattprattpratt @BryceDHoward @FilmBayona pic.twitter.com/VVdX3GIkMZ \n— Daniella Pineda (@Maniella) March 11, 2017 Just writing this post makes us want to go see the movie a second time. If you haven’t seen Get Out yet, what are you waiting for?!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T19:14:46.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
