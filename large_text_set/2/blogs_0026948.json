It's not exactly top-notch nutrition. For example, we ate lobster and carbohydrates before matches.” \nThe 34-year-old said team-mate Sejad Salihovic had a particularly hard time adjusting, and ate only rice and pasta for a long time. \n“If you don't know what it is and what it could be, you like to stick with the stuff you're familiar with.” \nMisimovic added that food isn't the only difference in China, however, with the physical recuperation being handled in ways he would never have imagined, while trips between domestic matches can also cause massive frustration for a newcomer to the country. \nWhy Rooney was right to turn down China \n“Our doctors at Renhe, for example, focus on traditional Chinese medicine, such as acupuncture,” he said. “That doesn't help in football, but it's going to change. \n“The standard flight should be three hours. But there are so many delays that sometimes you were happy to only be travelling for seven or eight hours. Sometimes we'd travel for two days before matches.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:54:11.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
