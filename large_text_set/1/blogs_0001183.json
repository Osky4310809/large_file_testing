Image Caption: It took more than three hours to rig the London Eye with fireworks \nAfter the celebrations came to an end, Detective Superintendent Phil Langworthy said: \"Once again, the eyes of the world were on London and a truly spectacular event has been delivered here.\" \nAlthough the capital's party animals may have gone home, work to keep London safe hasn't ended - with police working through the night to get the streets back to normal in time for the New Year's Day parade later on. \nMore than 500,000 spectators are expected to attend the parade, now in its 31st year, with more than 8,000 performers set to take part in the procession from Piccadilly to Parliament Square. \nThose who managed to get a ticket to London's sold-out event last night won't be forgetting the extravagant fireworks display anytime soon. \nThe pyrotechnic extravaganza boasted 12,000 fireworks which produced 50,000 projectiles over 12 minutes - all fired from the London Eye as well as three barges and 14 pontoons on the Thames. \nIt cost Â£1.8m to produce, and also featured tributes to some of the beloved stars who died over the past 12 months. Video: London Mayor addresses NYE security concerns \nBefore the display began, London Mayor Sadiq Khan had told Sky News: \"Our police and security services do an amazing job learning the lessons from some horrific incidents in other cities around the world - Berlin recently, Nice earlier this year, Paris last year. \n\"We've got to make sure we don't allow terrorists or people who want to destroy our way of life to stop us enjoying what's going to be a great night.\" \nUp in Edinburgh, an estimated 80,000 revellers took to the streets for the city's world-renowned Hogmanay celebrations - enjoying three fireworks shows ahead of the Midnight Moment from the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle. \nThere was also live music in the Scottish capital from the likes of The Charlatans and Paolo Nutini. Video: Edinburgh celebrates Hogmanay in style \nEven though London's display came hours before the likes of New York and Washington wave goodbye to 2016, Mr Khan confidently said the fireworks would be \"the best any city in the world is having tonight\". \nBut it might be wise to keep an eye on Hull, which is planning a New Year's Day spectacle to rival London's in honour of its new status as City of Culture.
