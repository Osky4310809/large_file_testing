This prison-inspired trend has no place in civilized society, which is why a number of businesses, communities, counties and schools have in the past few years banned saggy pants: the city of Pikeville, Tennessee ; the city of Timmonsville, South Carolina ; Jefferson Davis Parish in Louisiana; Bolivar Central High School in Tennessee; etc.   \nOf course, some liberals (not all, to be fair) have responded to such bans by complaining of racism — because apparently only black people sag their pants? When Henderson State University in Arkansas began cracking down on saggy pants two years ago, for instance, its liberal students began whining. \n“The group that I’m representing was outraged by the sign,” complained student Daisha Haggans, referencing signs put up by the college that warned sagging pants would not be tolerated, as reported at the time by KATV . \n“Its politically insensitive to certain groups,” added another student, Kristen Bell. “They felt like they were being targeted.” \nWhoopty doo. Laws, regulations and simple ol’ societal norms always displease some — namely the unruly types who have no regard for decency and respect. This is why the idea of basing rules on the oversensitive emotions of a few has never been a good idea.
