And they're not! With the cocaine still powder-fresh on the Rogue One producers' $100 bills, the official Star Wars twitter account just dropped a bombshell out of nowhere: The name of the next movie. It's official. STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is the next chapter of the Skywalker saga. This December. #TheLastJedi https://t.co/ySkVwQcMTP pic.twitter.com/eHrPgbsRJq — Star Wars (@starwars) January 23, 2017 \nThe full press release on their official website : \nWe have the greatest fans in this or any other galaxy. In appreciation of the fans, we wanted them to be the first to know the title of the next chapter in the Skywalker saga: STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI. \nTHE LAST JEDI is written and directed by Rian Johnson and produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Ram Bergman and executive produced by J.J. Abrams, Jason McGatlin, and Tom Karnowski. \nSTAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is scheduled for release December 15, 2017. \nThe Last Jedi ! That sounds cool! These movies have been coming out at Christmas for the past couple of years now, so it's no surprise that the next installment is running like clockwork. It's also nice to see that director J.J. Abrams, who received so much (deserved) praise for The Force Awakens , is still attached. \nWho is the last Jedi? Is it Rey? It's probably Rey. But like, what if it was actually Luke, and Rey's assumed assent to the Jedi throne isn't as straightforward as it seems? That's probably a little more complicated than they want to get with a Star Wars movie, but you never know, do you? \nIt's also, to me, a bit of a weird way to title it. The third film in the original trilogy was Return of The Jedi , after all, so if this is a call-back, the sequencing is off. Drop This Fact \nThe Force Awakens marked the only time Harrison Ford has received top billing in a Star Wars film, making him the first non-Jedi character to be credited first.
