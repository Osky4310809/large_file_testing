The upgrades focus on a contemporary new exterior design, higher levels of interior quality and improved driving performance. \nNew Nissan Intelligent Mobility technologies have also been added, continuing Nissan's ongoing journey towards zero emissions and zero fatalities. The new Qashqai will be available with ProPILOT autonomous driving capability during FY17, controlling the steering, acceleration and braking in a single lane on highways. This will provide consumers with a more confident drive, enhanced control and greater freedom during heavy traffic congestion and high-speed cruising. \nPaul Willcox, Chairman, Nissan Europe, commented: \"We have put the Nissan Intelligent Mobility vision at the heart of our product strategy, guiding the development of every vehicle. The new Nissan Qashqai is proof of that, with enhancements which will continue to define and set new standards in the crossover segment.\" \nInterior enhancements \nThe new Nissan Qashqai's premium appeal is most obvious in the cabin, where an improved layout, higher-quality materials and advanced technology return Qashqai to number one for desirability in the segment. \nBrand new is the range-topping Tekna+ grade, including new seats trimmed in high-quality soft nappa leather with luxurious 3D quilting on the centre panels. \nAlso new is a D-shaped multi-function steering wheel with premium satin-chrome inserts. It features a four-way controller for the combimeter display, for more intuitive use and less 'eyes off the road' time. 2018 Nissan Qashqai \nThe NissanConnect infotainment system, complete with DAB digital radio and satellite navigation, now features a smart new user interface. \nA new option for music fans is a BOSE seven-speaker premium sound system. For customers it represents a more complete audio experience, plus the opportunity to personalise in-car listening. \nExterior upgrades \nTo complement the interior upgrades the Qashqai's exterior benefits from a fresh design, offering greater sophistication and a new 'premium dynamic' style. The enhancements include a completely revised front end, bringing the latest Nissan 'V-motion' grille to the Qashqai. \nThe bumper and clam-shell bonnet are new, with revised light clusters and greater styling differentiation between the halogen and LED lamps. Each also gets a new version of the 'boomerang' Daytime Running Light signature. Redesigned front lamps add to the new Qashqai's premium appeal, while the addition of adaptive front lighting improves night-time safety. \nAt the rear, the car's instantly recognisable 'boomerang' light motif is extended across the whole lamp, and now includes a contemporary 3D lens effect to enhance the signature shape. \nAdded to the Nissan Qashqai's colour palette to boost the car's premium credentials are two vibrant new finishes. These include Vivid Blue, on the vehicle unveiled during Nissan's Geneva press conference, and Chestnut Bronze. \nMore confident drive \nThe Nissan Qashqai has always been known for its confident drive. Thanks to a number of under-the-skin improvements, the new model maintains its outstanding handling performance. Modifications to the suspension, damping and steering systems have resulted in an even more refined on-the-road experience. \nImproved use of absorption materials and increased rear glass thickness have led to a reduction in cabin noise from the road, engine and wind. Striking new 17, 18 and 19-inch alloy wheels are available, all aerodynamically optimised to maximise efficiency. \nEven with so many enhancements, the Qashqai's aerodynamic performance has not been compromised. It retains its class-leading drag coefficient of 0.31, and continues as segment leader on C02 emissions, with only 99g/km from the 1.5-litre dCi 110 diesel. Such innovation contributes to low running costs for Qashqai drivers. \nNew Nissan Intelligent Mobility Technology \nSince launch in 2007, the Nissan Qashqai has been at the heart of Nissan's desire to democratise Intelligent Driving technology, enhancing drivers' feelings of trust and being in control. With the new Qashqai that commitment to customers is extended even further. \nIntelligent Emergency Braking is being upgraded with Pedestrian Recognition. Rear Cross Traffic Alert, to mitigate the risk of low-speed impacts when reversing out of a parking space, is available on Qashqai for the first time. The car continues to be offered with Traffic Sign Recognition, Driver Attention Alert, Intelligent Park Assist, Intelligent Around View Monitor, Blind Spot Warning and Lane Departure Warning. \nAt the heart of the Nissan Qashqai's appeal has always been its position as the ultimate urban crossover. It successfully blends the practicality and desirability of an SUV with the footprint, running costs and accessibility of a hatchback. \nThe wide-ranging changes to the Qashqai are based on extensive customer insight and designed to reinforce its position as Europe's best-selling crossover. More than 2.3 million have been sold since the original version was launched in 2007. \nThe enhancements make the Nissan Qashqai a stronger and more exciting partner for drivers, ensuring it is ready for its second decade of crossover leadership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:10:06.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
