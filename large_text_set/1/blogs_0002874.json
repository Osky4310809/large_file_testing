Your thoughts, Alabama defensive end Jonathan Allen? \nAlabama DE Jonathan Allen on Washington: “They were soft. No disrespect, but we could have played better”\n— Brett McMurphy (@McMurphyESPN) December 31, 2016 Allen was apparently down on Washington much earlier in the day.\nAlabama DE Jonathan Allen, shaking his head, as he's walking off field at halftime: \"They're sorry. They're sorry\" https://t.co/hFkPSQLoVn \n— Brett McMurphy (@McMurphyESPN) December 31, 2016 Allen is certainly right that Alabama could’ve played better. The Tide only scored 24 points, marking their second-lowest output of the year. And seven of those came on defense, so the Alabama offense really wasn’t great, except when Bo Scarbrough was going full Beast Mode and sealing the game by himself. Quarterback Jalen Hurts was 7-of-14 for 57 yards and rendered pretty completely ineffective against the UW defense.\nOn another hand, Washington’s offense crossed the 50-yard line exactly twice , and one of those times followed the Huskies getting the ball at their own 45. Alabama’s non-Scarbrough players weren’t so impressive on offense, but Allen’s defense was legitimately great against a top-five scoring offense.\nWhether Washington was “soft” or not is a question the players on the field could answer better than any writer. There is this, though. \nAt any rate, Bama was significantly more powerful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T02:16:05.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
