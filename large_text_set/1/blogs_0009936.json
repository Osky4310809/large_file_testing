While the blow-by-blow action is pretty intense, it’s nowhere near as terrifying as say, seeing a guy fight off a kangaroo to save his dog (which actually happened in real life and still haunts us in our sleep).\nSo, who wants to adopt a pet hare? No takers? Meh, we didn’t think so. Usually, we can find some level of cuteness in any animal interactions since most of them tend to be painfully unaware of when they’re doing something adorable, but not so in the case of these mountain hares. No cuteness to be found in this footage, folks. Only scariness.\n\nInterestingly enough, biologist Dana Krempels told National Geographic that what appears to be two males fighting over a female in the above footage doesn’t represent typical mountain hare behavior. Krempels explained that what’s more than likely happening is the female hare (known as a jill; adorable) is actually the one involved in the slap battle as a means to ward off the male hares, or jacks, that are aggressively pursuing her at a time when she’s not ready to mate.\n“I don’t see testicles, so it’s hard to judge — but usually when you see behavior like that, it’s females rejecting the sexual advances of a male,” Krempels said, adding, “And I’m suspecting that there are two males here competing for her attention.” Life for humans has been kind of rough lately, but after watching this video, we’re thinking it’s not so bad after all.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:32:57.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
