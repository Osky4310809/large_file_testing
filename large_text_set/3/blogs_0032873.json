Kim Jong-Nam’s, half-brother of Kim Jong-Un, body returned to North Korea: Here’s what we know so far! According to Chinese officials, the body of Kim Jong-Nam, half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, has arrived in Pyongyang. By: FE Online | Published: March 31, 2017 3:54 PM Malaysian police took statements from three North Koreans wanted for questioning in the murder of Kim Jong Nam before they were allowed to leave the country along with the body of the victim, police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said. \nAccording to Chinese officials, the body of Kim Jong-Nam, half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, has arrived in Pyongyang. “The body of the DPRK citizen who died in Malaysia and relevant DPRK citizens have returned to the DPRK today via Beijing,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. Here are all the developments so far: \n1) Malaysian police took statements from three North Koreans wanted for questioning in the murder of Kim Jong Nam before they were allowed to leave the country along with the body of the victim, police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said. \n2) The North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur initially said the victim was Kim Jong Nam, but identified him the next day as Kim Chol, the name given in the dead man’s passport, the police chief said. Since then, North Korea has maintained that the dead man is not Kim Jong Nam. \n3) The three North Koreans and the remains of Kim Jong Nam returned to North Korea on Friday via Beijing in a swap deal that saw nine Malaysians allowed to return home from Pyongyang. \n4) Kim Jong-Nam death triggered a major clash between Malaysia and North Korea, which saw them expel each other’s ambassadors and bar citizens from leaving. \n5) Kim Jong Nam’s murder was remarkably public, according to North Korea analysts. The assassins chose an airport covered by CCTV cameras and a designated weapon of mass destruction possessed by only a few states, North Korea among them. \n6) The two women who smeared the VX nerve agent on Kim – described by police as Vietnamese “entertainment outlet employee” Doan Thi Huong and Indonesian “spa masseuse” Siti Aisyah – were arrested three days after the killing. \n7) According to South Korean and US intelligence sources, North Korea masterminded the attack, which Pyongyang denies. \n8) Kim Jong Nam was murdered at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13 by assassins using VX nerve agent, a chemical so lethal that it is on a UN list of weapons of mass destruction.
