DIY Smartwatch Runs Windows 98 My middle school celebrated Pi Day (not yet an officially observed celebration when I was 12) by wrapping the mathematical constant around the school walls as far as it could reach. \nWe‚Äôve come a long way from construction paper and tape: Rhett Allain, associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, made ‚Äúan artistic expression of pi‚Äù using his Raspberry Pi computer. \n‚ÄúI wanted to somehow create something I can display in the hallway at school to share pi with students,‚Äù he wrote on Wired . ‚ÄúThen they too might find themselves addicted to the awesomeness of pi.‚Äù \nRhett Allain (Wired)\nAllain‚Äôs DIY Pi Day project looks a lot like the science fair entries back at that middle school: a bunch of components hot-glue-gunned to a poster board. The placard features a 16-by-2 LCD character display (providing a real-time value of the estimate of pi) and a reset button (push to restart the random calculation). \n‚ÄúBecause I am a physics professor, I added three pages of info explaining pi, how to calculate pi, and all the strange places you can find pi,‚Äù Allain said. (He even provided a printable PDF .) ‚ÄúI also added a beeper that emits a small (and very annoying) beep every time the computer adds another point to the diagram. \n‚ÄúI like the beeper because it draws attention to the poster as people pass it. I also really like the completely unnecessary LCD display because it looks cool,‚Äù he added. \nPi, of course, is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter; the irrational number cannot be written as a fraction, and its famed 3.145926535897‚Ä¶ the figure is just an approximation. \nStill, we‚Äôve latched onto the sum, turning March 14 (3/14 in the month/day format) into an annual occasion, celebrated with pie (duh) and ùõë. The date also happens to mark Albert Einstein‚Äôs birthday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T08:13:44.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
