Think about it: Friends dominated television in the late-90s, with the NBC series being the most watched show of the 2001-2002 season . Right now, The Walking Dead is that juggernaut . What it says about the natural arc of the American psyche that our favorite show used to be a sitcom about young people living in an unrealistically large apartment for their tax bracket and is now about cannibalism and zombies is a quandary for another day. \nInstead of dwelling on America’s slow descent into nilhism, instead watch the above video from The Woodcreek Faction that takes the decaying world of The Walking Dead and puts zombie-killing with its natural musical accompaniment: the upbeat pop of The Rembrandts.
