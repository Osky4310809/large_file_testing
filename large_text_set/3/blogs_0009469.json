Bogachev, described as “the most wanted cybercriminal in the world,” full of details about the hacker’s crimes, plots, some incredible tidbits and a photo to end all amazing FBI photos. \nBogachev has long been sought after for his hacking schemes, draining millions of dollars from businesses the world over and placing him in control of hundreds of thousands of computers. His GameOver Zeus malware scheme, which was shut down in 2014, netted him a Scrooge McDuck-sized vault of money to swim in. \nAnd Bogachev hasn’t curtailed his activities; according to the Times story, it’s believed he’s in cahoots with Russian intelligence. He was, after all, one of the individuals to have sanctions levied against him by the Obama administration in late 2016 in response to allegations of Russian hacking aimed at affecting the U.S. presidential election. \nSo what is he up to? Living like a supervillain. \nLet’s start with this amazing photo. \nLOOK AT THAT PHOTO. \nLOOK AT IT. \nHe’s holding a pet Bengal cat while wearing leopard pajamas while wearing sunglasses indoors . He’s a pair of muscular henchmen away from being a Bond villain. \nNot convinced? How about these nuggets? “At one point, he owned two villas in France and kept a fleet of cars parked around Europe so he would never have to rent a vehicle while on vacation …“ He has many luxury car but prefers his Jeep Grand Cherokee (presumably to go collect more pet Bengal cats). \nHe owns a yacht. \nHe’s extremely paranoid. \nHe lives openly under his own name. Now that is baller. \nThere’s no extradition agreement between the U.S. and Russia and it’s not like the Russians are in any mood to cooperate with the U.S. in this fight over hacking anyway, so Bogachev can continue to sit pretty for now. (The Times notes that the fact he’s living freely is evidence of chicanery with Russian intelligence.) \nFor now, there’s a $3 million reward for Bogachev’s capture and all I can really do is ask Mr. Bogachev to please not hack me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T09:56:47.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
