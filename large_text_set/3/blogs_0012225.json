Ever since she spoke blatantly about nepotism in Bollywood and accused Karan Johar of the same, it has become something that everybody is talking about, because let’s face it, we all know it exists. Anushka Sharma was at the press conference for Phillauri yesterday and was asked by Indian Express if she had to deal with nepotism. Here’s what she said. \nWe all have different journeys and different experiences and I am sure the actors sitting next to me on the stage will agree on this part. Aditya Chopra gave me my launchpad. Yes, I am an outsider and he launched me in a big film. Similarly, he has launched Ranveer Singh and Parineeti Chopra and we three are completely from a non-filmy background. Going by my experience, I have a lot of respect for Aditya Chopra because he gave a platform to the actors and I have personally never experienced it [nepotism]. For me, things changed after Band Baaja Baaraat and then people started taking me seriously and that film literally changed my life. \nShe makes a lot of sense. 17", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T09:51:57.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
