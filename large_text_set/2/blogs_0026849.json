In the meantime, Russian drone maker Hoversurf Inc. unveiled its own electric-powered hoverbike, the Scorpion-3 (video above). \nThe single-seat aircraft is “the next step in accessible amateur flying developed to inspire athletes, engineers, scientists, and innovators around the world,” according to the company website .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:36:37.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
