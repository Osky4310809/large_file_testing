I just know that they are thinking of me and I'm thinking of them. It helps me get through the weekend.\" \nJoe Clabaugh and Carlos Pimentel got packages from their organization, Mont Alto. \n\"To get a letter from them, that means a lot to us,\" Clabaugh (junior - physical therapist assistant) said. \"[It helps us get through the 46 hours] because it feels like there's someone looking out for us even though it kind of feels like we are down here by ourselves, but we got everybody else around us and they are helping us make it through. It gives us a huge boost.\" \nPimentel (sophomore - supply chain management) said the letter he got was signed by the captains of Mont Alto. He also received a note from the Penn State Alumni Association as well as a stress ball. \n\"It's incredible,\" Piementel said. \"You're here, and you can see your org members from [the floor], but you can't touch them, you can't feel them. So that when you get the mail you know can tell that even though they aren't down here with us, they're here in spirit.\" \nOn hand to help pass out mail was now-retired and beloved University Park mailman Mike Herr, better known as \"Mike the Mailman.\" \n\"People always ask me how I'm doing [in retirement], and I always say 'I've never had a bad day,'\" Herr said. \"What these kids do here is unbelievable. I love what the kids do here. These guys are the heart and soul of Penn State. They make it happen and they have sacrificed all year long for this. It's not just a 46-hour event, its year round. I love being apart of mail call.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:42:23.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
