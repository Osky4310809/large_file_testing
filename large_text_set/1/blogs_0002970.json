Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock Thursday 5 January 2017 10.59   11.01   \nA debut novel about inherited identity, a dystopian fantasy from a former children’s laureate, a study of Indian healthcare and radical history of black Britain have all been lined up to contend for the first British book prize exclusively for writers of colour. \nChasing the Stars by Malorie Blackman heads a 12-strong longlist for the Jhalak prize for book of the year by a writer of colour . The prize was launched to improve the poor representation of writers from culturally diverse backgrounds and mixes fiction, nonfiction and children’s literature. Jhalak book prize launched for under-recognised UK writers of colour Read more \nBlackman’s novel is the latest dystopian fantasy by the former children’s laureate. Writing in the Guardian, Tony Bradman declared: “Never before have I come across a book that’s a combination of Star Trek, Ten Things I Hate About You and a murder mystery. What’s not to like?” \nAt the other end of the spectrum from Blackman’s edge-of-the-seat adventure is Bafta award-winning broadcaster and historian David Olusoga, whose Black and British: A Forgotten History, is a radical reappraisal of the parameters of history and the relationship between Britain and Africa. The book was tied to a high-profile BBC TV series. Writing in the Guardian , Olusoga said he was inspired to explore the forgotten history of Britain’s black community by his own upbringing on a council estate in the north-east of England. “My right, not just to regard myself as a British citizen, but even to be in Britain, seemed contested,” he said. \nSunny Singh, co-founder of the prize and chair of judges, said: “The first ever Jhalak prize longlist demonstrates the strength, range and promise being produced by writers of colour in the UK today.” \nPoet and broadcaster Musa Okwonga, who is also on the judging panel, said: “This is easily some of the most compelling work that I have seen in several years.” \nThe longlist features three other YA titles alongside Blackman’s novel: Nine Is Not OK by Shappi Khorsandi; Orangeboy by Patrice Lawrence; and The Girl of Ink and Stars by Kiran Millwood Hargrave. \nThe settings of the longlisted books span the globe. Rowan Hisayo Buchanan’s at times harrowing novel Harmless Like You, which examines inherited identity, travels from New York to Berlin. Arathi Prasad’s In the Bonesetter’s Waiting Room explores the intersection between traditional and conventional medicine in India, while Irenosen Okojie’s short-story collection Speak Gigantular ranges from the ghosts of the London Underground to lovelorn aliens in outer space. \nTwo weeks before submissions closed, Singh was alarmed that only 51 books had been put up for the award , with little interest from major publishers. In the end, explained co-founder Nikesh Shukla, the picture had improved somewhat, with 121 entries. “This is all very rough but … 30% were from small presses, 29% from independents, 28% from the big guys and 16% self-published. \n“It feels like change is coming, slowly. This means that next year I imagine we’ll start to see much more submissions.” \nJhalak was launched following publication in 2015 of Writing the Future , a damning report from writers’ development agency Spread the Word about BAME representation in UK publishing. Open to any published writer of colour in the UK regardless of genre, both fiction and nonfiction, the prize is also open to self-published writers, although none have made it to the longlist. \nAlso longlisted are: Gary Younge for Another Day in the Death of America; Jacob Ross for The Bone Readers; Kei Miller for Augustown and A Rising Man by Abir Mukherjee. The shortlist for the prize will be announced on 6 February, with the winner revealed in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T13:06:07.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
