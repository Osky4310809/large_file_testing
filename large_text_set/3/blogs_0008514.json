Watch | South Korea's corruption scandal in 60 seconds 01:11 \nS outh Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Ms Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Ms Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys. \nWhoever becomes the next leader will take over a country facing a hostile North Korea, a stagnant economy and deep social and political divides. \nPre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans had wanted the court to approve Ms Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Ms Park's ouster would further polarise the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents. Profile | Park Geun-hye \nM s Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Ms Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since. \nP eople on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Ms Park's lawyers told the court last month that there will be \"a rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\" if Ms Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \"revolution\" if the court rejected Park's impeachment. \n\"If Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\" said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul's Konkuk University. \"But looking at what she's done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\" \nOthers disagreed, saying violent protests won't be supported by the general public.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T04:53:10.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
