Leicester stars go bananas as they book their place in the quarter-finals (Photo: Getty) \nBut their impressive display against Sevilla, at an intense, rocking King Power Stadium, has reverberated around Europe. \nReal Madrid have won Europe’s premier knockout tournament a record 11 times, but Zidane admitted: “I don’t think there will be a single coach who are hoping they face Leicester. \n“They keep achieving what they are told they can’t achieve. \n“Many thought they wouldn’t hold on to their lead at the top of the Premier League — and they did. After last season's title-race fairy tale, Leicester are springing fresh shocks (Photo: Getty) \n“Many thought they could not turnaround the defeat against Sevilla — and they did. \n“Whatever club Leicester face, they [Leicester] won’t be favourites. And with that pressure off them and on the other team, anything can happen. \n“We have seen they have some very talented players but they also play with a lot of passion and heart. That is never easy to face. \n“In the last eight, you are going to be in for two tough games. It’s the stage of the competition where everybody starts to believe and to dream they can win it.” Will Craig Shakespeare succeed Zidane in lifting the European Cup this June?

Leicester. \n“They are a dangerous and passionate team who can cause trouble for opponents who take the initiative. We would have everything to lose.” Juventus veteran Buffon knows Leicester are a team to keep your eye on (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nWith Vardy terrorising their entire defence on his own, the Sevilla never got into their rhythm or had a chance to compose themselves. They snatched at chances — to the frustration of highly-regarded coach Jorge Sampaoli, who was sent to the stands late on. \nOn-loan Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri also lost his cool and was sent off for head-butting Vardy as the Spaniards imploded after conceding goals to Wes Morgan and Marc Albrighton. \nBut the Foxes still needed Kasper Schmeichel to save Steven N’Zonzi’s late penalty to ensure they progressed. Hero Schmeichel saved penalties in both legs of the Sevilla tie (Photo: Getty) \nSchmeichel, who also saved a spot-kick in last month's 2-1 first leg defeat, reflected: “It was a fantastic team performance. We were on it right from the first minute and I always felt confident we were going to win. \n“I fancy us in any game. \n\"When we go on the pitch, I obviously see what’s happening in the dressing room and I know the lads are up for it every time. I’m always confident with this team. \n\"It’s a game of confidence sometimes. We’ve been low on confidence at times this season. You can go on a losing run and we are more than capable of going on a winning run as well. \n“We’re a good side — that’s what we’ve got to remember.” \nEurope’s elite have been warned. poll loading Will Leicester reach the Champions League semis? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:47:33.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
