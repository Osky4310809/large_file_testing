Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSpanish giants Real Madrid have made a former Tottenham player a surprise transfer target, despite him never having played for the Spurs' first team. \nFans of the White Hart Lane club could be forgiven for not remembering Yuri Berchiche, considering he didn't make a single appearance for the North London side. \nBut he has done enough at current club Real Sociedad to show up on Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane's radar, and he could now be set for a summer switch, reports The Sun .
