You can watch the results in the video above. The NCAP says the Tsuru was involved in more than 4,000 deaths in Mexico between 2007 and 2012.\nAdvertisement \n\nAdvertisement \n\nNeedless to say, it’s not something you want to crash, but it’s an example of how safe cars have become in just 25 years. \n\nSo 2017 will be the final year of the Tsuru in Mexico and it’s headed out with a special edition called the “Buen Camino”, which means“Good Way” in Spanish. And man, is it a window into what cars used to look and feel like.\n\nThe top model “Buen Camino” Tsuru starts at 172,500 Mexican pesos, roughly $8,500 in U.S. dollars, making it still cheaper than any new car you can find north of the border. Other Tsuru models are even cheaper.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:23:34.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
