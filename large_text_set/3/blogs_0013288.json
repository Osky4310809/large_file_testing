Delays Aquaman Release Megan Peters Back to Article Image of \nHere we go again. If you are a fan of the DC Extended Universe, then you have yet another change coming your way. After being pushed back once already, it looks like Aquaman is getting shoved aside just a bit more. Instead of hitting theaters in October 2018, Aquaman will now reportedly hit theaters in time for the holidays. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal’s Ben Fritz, Aquaman has been pushed back to December 21, 2018. The date may sound familiar to some comic book fans as it also marks the release of Sony’s animated Spider-Man film featuring Miles Morales. You can read Fritz’s tweet below: \n“Warner Bros. pushes back Aquaman release from 10/5/18 to 12/21/18. Same day as Sony's animated Spider-Man!” \nOf course, many fans were not expecting this pushback given the progress Aquaman has made over the past couple of months. Pre-production is already underway on the project, and director James Wan has been busy scouting filming locations for the flick. As for its stars, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard met up with the director alongside Patrick Wilson to scope out its script. And, recently, Momoa has shared a slew of training updates with fans. \nWith the new adjustment, Aquaman will still be hitting theaters after DC Entertainment screens its untitled movie scheduled for July 27th. The spot still remains open, and fans have wondered if The Flash may be moved down to that release slot given its recent directorial concerns. So, for now, fans will have to suffice will seeing Aquaman when he joins the cast of Justice League when it debuts this summer. \nIn Justice League, fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. \nJustice League is directed by Zack Snyder, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio, and features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Ciarán Hinds, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Jeremy Irons and Jesse Eisenberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:04:55.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
