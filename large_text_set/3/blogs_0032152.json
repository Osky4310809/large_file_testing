I thought some of them were kind of creative,\" she said. \"But you just have to keep going.\" \nWithout mentioning President Donald Trump by name, Clinton faulted the Republican presidential administration repeatedly, including calling its representation of women in top jobs \"the lowest in a generation.\" \nShe rebuked White House press secretary Sean Spicer, again not by name, for hours earlier Tuesday chiding a black woman journalist during a news conference for shaking her head. \n\"Too many women have had a lifetime of practice taking this kind of indignity in stride,\" Clinton said. \nShe ended by urging voters to resist Trump policies that she said included suspicion of refugees and voter suppression in some areas. \n\"These are bad policies that will hurt people and take our country in the wrong direction,\" Clinton said, relaying what she had become one of her mantras since the November election. \n\n\"It's the kinds of things you think about when you take long walks in the woods,\" she said. \"Resist, insist, persist, enlist.\" \nSeems like a little different message from that of the campaign \"stronger together\" or her concession speech ... \n\"I still believe in America, and I always will. And, if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\" \nStill, no matter what, it appears no matter what the message that The Clintons and The Democrats try to churn out, support remains dismal...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:07:55.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
