These two puppers were homeless just a few short years ago when they were surrendered to Rocket Dog Rescue in San Francisco. According to the site, the two dogs were inseparable in the shelter and refused to be adopted without the other. Thankfully Merill, a Pit Bull mix, and Taco, a Chihuahua, didn't have to be split up and went home together, and we can all take part in their joy through this adorable photo that's recirculating the internet lately. We sure to love a good rescue story!\nRelated:\nProud Mama Pit Bull Wants Her New Human to Meet All Her Babies\nImage Source: Rocket Dog Rescue", "external_links": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Z3kgzVL1ab-aoJd-yVOxmY7G-Xg/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/02/02/948/n/1922243/43fb3bebea3d991f_yfhdavmejbdy.jpg", "https://www.rocketdogrescue.org/dog/merrill-taco/?status=for-adoption"], "published": "2017-03-31T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:06:19.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
