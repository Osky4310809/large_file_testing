THEN, it introduces an intriguing and strangely prescient theme: video chat. “Baby baby we can do more than just talk ,\nCause I can hear ya hear ya, and I can see ya see ya “\nThis is 2001, was there even Skype yet?\nID: 10234225 View this image ›\nDisney ID: 10238056 6. It goes on innocently enough: “Every time I’m sittin’ home alone girl\nI can’t wait to get you on the phone girl\nSo, pick it up, babe”\nOkay, fine — who among us hasn’t sat alone wishing our crush would communicate with us?\nID: 10234244 7. But then things get weird: the next line is “I can see everything you do” So does the telephone have video capabilities?\nID: 10238041 8. I’m honestly confused by the technology described in this song. View this image ›\namazon.com ID: 10238059 9. The protagonist is all over the place. “Can we get connected?\nI need some love and affection, baby\nI’ll call you on the phone\nI hope that I get through”\nPhone, video chat, which is it??\nID: 10238001 10. Okay but here’s where the song gets low key raunchy: “If you’re in the mood and on the phone,\nhere’s what you do: leave a message\nYou know the kind I like to get back to”\nWhat type of message do they like to get back to, do you think?\nID: 10234633 View this image ›\nMTV ID: 10234759 12. Then we get into full-blown phone sex. “I lose my mind just when you’re speaking\nI see you on the screen, I get to freaking\nSo, get down, babe\nAnd I’ll get down for you”\nID: 10234638 13. If there was any doubt about the nature of the song… “I get so excited when I’m watching, girl\nI can’t wait to see you touch your body, girl\nIt’s just me and you\nSo, we can do what we gotta do (yeah)”\nID: 10234642 View this image ›\nMTV ID: 10234760 15. With its thinly-veiled innuendo, the song is actually a pretty clairvoyant take on romance in the age of Snapchat. Consider the chorus again:\n“Digital, digital get down (get down) just you and me\n(You may be) Twenty thousand miles away, but I can see ya\nAnd baby, baby you can see me\nDigital, digital get down (get down) just what we need\nWe can get together naturally\n(We can) We can get together on the digital screen”\nLike, it’s totally cool that you can digitally get down with a lover halfway across the world, even if the idea didn’t totally make sense in 2001.\nID: 10234670 16. TL;DR: this song is basically “Send nudes” in 2001.
