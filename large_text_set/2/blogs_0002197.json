Tomatoes, lettuce, and a smattering of pickles give it an extra layer of texture. Located in Tehrangeles, Attari is owned by the family that opened the first Persian convenience store in the area in the late 1980s. The food is made entirely from family recipes. Kabobs are a plenty here, served with Persian flatbread and greens. Don’t miss the ash , which is a thick, barley-based stew made with white and pinto beans drizzled with a bit of kashk , a zippy yogurt-like cream. 1388 Westwood Blvd., Los Angeles.

Trained in macrobiotic cooking, he is the driving force behind Ihsan, which is the Arabic word for kindness. Ihsan is a vegan falafel stand that can be found at farmers’ markets throughout the city. Give the collard green wrap a try. It forgoes the traditional wheat exterior for collard greens and is stuffed with five falafel balls, grated carrots, and homemade turnip pickles. Don’t miss the traditional spicy peanut sauce, referred to in Sudan as dakwa . It's made with creamy peanut butter and jalapeños. Various locations; see website for schedule. authenticfalafels.com. Josh Lurie \nSyria: Saj from Sarig’s Bakery Owner Sako Dekirmanjian comes from Aleppo, Syria , where his grandfather ran a bakery. The saj , thin crust bread baked on a convex metal grill, is a good way to start. It can be ordered with zaatar , an herb mixture of thyme, sesame seed, and virgin olive oil or paired with white cheese with homemade sausage. We like the laham b’ajin , which are Syrian open-faced meat pies stuffed with ground beef, pomegranate molasses, and pine nuts. Don’t forgo the desert menu, which pairs saj with nutella, marshmallows, and sliced almonds. 19253 Roscoe Blvd, Northridge. (818) 727-7443. sarigsbakery.com. Banadir's goat soup and anjero Susan Ji-Young Park \nSomalia: Goat from Banadir Somali Restaurant This is a halal mainstay that specializes in goat meat, which is an ingredient that permeates throughout most of the menu. There’s goat soup, pressure-cooked goat, and braised goat, usually accompanied by traditional Somali spices like cardamom, cloves, coriander, bay leaves, cinnamon, and cumin. For breakfast, the anjero is the primary carb of choice. It’s a pancake-like bread similar to Ethiopia’s injera , but smaller and thinner. It is served with savory toppings like goat, chicken, or beef, or can be eaten as a dessert sprinkled with sugar or a bit of sesame oil and honey. 137 W. Arbor Vitae St., Inglewood. (310) 419-9900. Malawach from Toast Cafe with the traditional accompaniments of mild, shredded tomato salsa, sliced green olives and hard-boiled eggs Kayvan Gabbay \nYemen: Malawach from Toast Cafe There aren’t any Yemeni-specific restaurants in Los Angeles (that we know of), but malawach is a staple that can be found in a lot of Middle Eastern restaurants throughout the region. You can get malawach at Toast Cafe in the San Fernando Valley. It’s a fantastic puff pastry that was also popularized in Israel when the Yemenite Jews brought it over after immigrating in the 1950s. Yemen also has its own version of shakshouka , a baked egg and tomato dish that is popular for both breakfast and dinner. In Yemen, it’s distinguished by scrambled eggs and a liberal use of hot green chili peppers. 15001 Ventura Blvd, Sherman Oaks. Tacos at Revolutionario Sarah Bennett \nLibya: Tagine from Revolutionario While restaurants dedicated to the food of Libya aren't apparent in Los Angeles, there is definitely not a shortage of places to get couscous , which is considered to be the national dish of Libya. There, it is commonly prepared with slow-cooked beef, potatoes, carrots and garbanzo beans in a spicy tomato sauce. Tagine is another popular dish in Libya, which can be found all over North Africa and, most commonly, in Morocco. We recommend the chickpea tagine tacos from Revolutionario near Exposition Park. It’s owned by Farid Zadi, who is considered Los Angeles’ foremost expert on North African cuisine. 1436 W Jefferson Blvd, Los Angeles.
