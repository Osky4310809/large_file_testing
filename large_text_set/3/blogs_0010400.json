Those looking at a new Honda, or considering the freshly facelifted Honda City might want to take advantage of this latest promotion by Honda Malaysia. \nThe on-form brand says that it will be “celebrating another milestone at the end of this month” (sounds like a production milestone) and in conjunction with that, is having two campaigns to reward customers. \nThe “Best Time to Get Best Protection” promo sees Honda Malaysia (HM) offer the Ecotint RayBarrier Splendour window film at RM850 to all new and existing Honda owners, valid from now until March 29. This represents savings of 61%, or RM1,350 over the normal price of RM2,200. The warranty is five years. We checked and yes, existing customers are welcome. \nAccording to HM, the Ecotint RayBarrier Splendour tint – manufactured using advanced nanotechnology from Sumitomo Japan – has high heat rejection of “Ultra 99.9% UV-A and UV-B protection” and offers “unparalleled glass break protection” with the firm’s Multi-Layer Film Lamination technology. Further info can be obtained at Honda dealerships. \nHM is also organising “The Digital Treasure Hunt Wall Contest”, which is open to all Malaysians. To be in the running to win prizes, visit any Honda dealer from March 16-22 and take a selfie with the jigsaw puzzle piece answer to questions on Honda Malaysia’s Facebook page . Post the image on the same FB post. \nThese activities are in addition to HM’s ongoing 3S or Best Deals Promotion, where customers get to enjoy two years of free service (parts and labour) or a cash option upon purchase. This promo runs throughout March and April 2017. \nWe’re still in the first quarter of the year, and there have been two product launches from Honda already – the BR-V seven-seater kicked things off in January and the City facelift made its debut earlier this month. Both have been off to flying starts. The sub-RM100k BR-V sees Honda enter the budget MPV segment for the first time, armed with SUV styling. Buyers are convinced – 9,500 names are in the order books as of today – and you can read our full review of it here . \nThe City facelift improves on what was already the top selling B-segment sedan in Malaysia. The refreshed car gets a Civic FC -style face and more features for the same money. HM has collected 2,000 bookings in the 10 days following the official launch, with the range-topping V variant making up a significant 44% of the total. Prices range from RM78,300 to RM92,000. \nGALLERY: Honda City V", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T11:06:57.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
