The cure: an adult-sized vacation stay in a treehouse. On sites like VRBO and Glamping Hub , you can choose locations around the world, from a tropical, open-air treehouse paradise in Brazil to a South Carolina treehouse boasting southern comfort and interesting antiques. There’s no better way to integrate with your vacation surroundings than by living in the trees (with amazing views). Your childhood treehouse goals just grew up. 1. Rustic forest retreat in Quebec \nYou may not be able to pronounce the name of the town in which this treehouse is situated (“Nominingue”), but you should know that it’s in Quebec , a few hours from both Ottawa and Montreal. Nestled among fir, maple, and birch trees, the treehouse has solar-powered light sources and amazing views, all accessible by a maze of bridges and stairs. A perfect location to get temporarily snowed in, this rustic retreat is also close to a wildlife refuge and a small town. 2. Tropical rainforest treehouse \nThis rainforest treehouse located near Bahia, Brazil makes visitors feel like they are stepping into a glam and verdant alternative world. The open-air layout encourages all who come and stay (the house plus adjacent bungalow sleep four) to revel in the expanse of untamed nature while lounging in the property’s hammocks , taking a dip in the on-site pool, or watching wildlife in its natural habitat from the deck. The treehouse is made from 100-year-old reclaimed wood and covered with a roof crafted from piassava, a sturdy fiber from the leaf stalks of palm trees. 3. A tried-and-true treehouse for grown-ups \nThis treehouse has been around for almost 20 years and is built around a 150-year-old oak tree, so it’s definitely a sure bet for wannabee treehouse dwellers. It’s only 20 minutes to San Francisco , so visitors can get their fix of the city before hightailing it out to a forested canyon and the treehouse’s welcoming wrap-around porch. The tree swing and lofted bed reachable by ladder will make guests feel like they are revisiting their youth on a larger scale. 4. A treehouse bridging the mountain and sea \nThis treetop living option is also just a short drive’s away from Monterey Bay and several beaches. A green interior with leafy details evokes the outdoors, as do the variations in wood elements. This treehouse is also one of the more equipped options we’ve seen, with a fridge, private hot tub, and bathroom. Toggle back and forth between the beach and the mountains anytime during your stay-the treehouse’s location in the “Banana Belt” makes it visitor-friendly year-round. \nImages by Justin Tobias Photography 5. Southern hospitality with an antique twist \nThe views at this South Carolina treehouse are unbeatable. The owners call the treehouse’s style “vintage royalty” and outfitted it accordingly with a hand-painted king bed, vintage board games, and antique furniture. The result is a surprisingly elegant space that feels like it was built as a playground for a nature-loving aristocrat (or like a much more down-to-earth version of Marie Antoinette and her Petit Trianon). An outdoor rope bed and 40 acres of farm and woods to explore may be the only things to lure visitors out of the treehouse itself. 6. Beachside, solar-powered “treehouse” \nIf you have a fear of heights but still want to hang in a treehouse and have the benefit of being beachside as well, check out this Mexican getaway . Part of a solar-powered eco resort that has committed to using only sustainable and local woods and bamboo grass for construction, the “treehouse” is only 6 feet off the ground. The best part about this pad for animal lovers: the resort is also the site of a Turtle Sanctuary, which means these adorable amniotes are only steps away (and no, you can’t bring them to stay with you, although they might enjoy the in-floor hammock too). 7. Funky Vietnamese pad in the sky \nStaying at this unique treehouse in Hanoi will make visitors feel like they are in an art-filled secret garden. Designed by a local artist, the design veers from the typical rustic décor and includes original art pieces (including some floating exterior sculptures that light up at night) and modern touches such as a little wine “lounge” and a surround sound stereo system. Views of the expansive garden will keep visitors grounded, even as they remain almost 40 feet above the earth. © Lara Florio 8. Modern, industrial treehouse on the edge of the woods \nWith an interior that oozes a cool, minimalist Teutonic vibe and industrial accents, this space will make you rethink your assumptions about treehouses. With modern appliances and clean design elements, it may be a great vacation spot for families divided between the nature-adverse and treehuggers. Located on the edge of a Berlin forest, the treehouse looks so move-in ready, we’re considering a transfer. 9. Texas treehouse with bird’s eye views \nThis Texas treehouse looks a bit like a barn gone topsy turvy. Located near Austin , the interior is surprisingly luxe, with multicolored wooden walls and a comfy, family-friendly layout. A bird’s nest lookout and treehouse bridges take visitors to next-level views, including those of the nearby waterfall and creek.
