This mystery of the faith cannot be fully understood by the human mind but is a key doctrine of Christianity . While the word Trinity does not appear in the Bible, several episodes include the simultaneous appearance of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, such as the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist ( Matthew 3:16-17 ). \nWe find many names for God in the Bible. Jesus urged us to think of God as our loving father and went a step further by calling him Abba , an Aramaic word roughly translated as \"Daddy,\" to show us how intimate our relationship with him is. \nGod the Father is the perfect example for all earthly fathers. He is holy, just and fair, but his most outstanding quality is love: Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. (1 John 4:8, NIV ) \nGod's love motivates everything he does. Through his covenant with Abraham , he chose the Jews as his people, then nurtured and protected them, despite their frequent disobedience. In his greatest act of love, God the Father sent his only Son to be the perfect sacrifice for the sin of all humanity, Jews and Gentiles alike. \nThe Bible is God's love letter to the world, divinely inspired by him and written by more than 40 human authors. In it, God gives his Ten Commandments for righteous living , instructions on how to pray and obey him, and shows how to join him in heaven when we die, by believing in Jesus Christ as our Savior. Accomplishments of God the Father \nGod the Father created the universe and everything in it. He is a big God but at the same time is a personal God who knows each person's every need. Jesus said God knows us so well he has numbered every hair on each person's head. \nGod set a plan in place to save humanity from itself. Left to ourselves, we would spend eternity in hell because of our sin. God graciously sent Jesus to die in our place, so that when we choose him , we can choose God and heaven. \nGod the Father's plan for salvation is lovingly based on his grace , not on human works. Only Jesus' righteousness is acceptable to God the Father. Repenting of sin and accepting Christ as Savior makes us justified , or righteous, in God's eyes. \nGod the Father has triumphed over Satan. Despite Satan's evil influence in the world, he is a defeated foe. God's final victory is certain. Strengths of God the Father \nGod the Father is omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all-knowing), and omnipresent (everywhere). \nHe is absolute holiness. No darkness exists within him. \nGod is just yet merciful. He gave humans the gift of free will, by not forcing anyone to follow him. Anyone who rejects God's offer of forgiveness of sins is responsible for the consequences of their decision. \nGod cares. He intervenes in the lives of people. He answers prayer and reveals himself through his Word (the Bible), circumstances, and people. \nGod is sovereign . He is in complete control, no matter what is happening in the world. His ultimate plan always overrules humankind. Life Lessons \nA human lifetime is not long enough to learn about God, but the Bible is the best place to start. While the Word itself never changes, God miraculously teaches us something new about him every time we read it. \nSimple observation shows that people who do not have God are lost, both figuratively and literally. They have only themselves to rely on in times of trouble, and will have only themselves--not God and his blessings--in eternity. \nGod the Father can be known only through faith , not reason. Unbelievers demand physical proof. Jesus Christ supplied that proof, by fulfilling prophecy , healing the sick, raising the dead, and rising from death himself, but most people in his own time would not believe their own eyes. Hometown \nGod has always existed. His very name, Yahweh , means \"I AM\", indicating that he always has been and always will be. The Bible does not reveal what he was doing before he created the universe, but it does say that God is in heaven, with Jesus sitting at his right hand. References to God the Father in the Bible \nThe entire Bible is the story of God the Father, Jesus Christ , the Holy Spirit , and God's plan for salvation . Despite being written thousands of years ago, the Bible is always relevant to our lives because God is always relevant to our lives. Occupation: \nGod the Father is the Supreme Being, Creator and Sustainer, deserving of human worship and obedience . In the First Commandment , God warns us not to put anyone or anything above him.
