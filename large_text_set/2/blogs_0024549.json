Following Claudio Ranieri's sacking on Thursday, that makes for four of the last five Premier League title-winning managers not making to the end of the following season. Only Manuel Pellegrini from 2013-14 through 2015-16 made it out unscathed, but even he was a lame duck midway through the season. Here's a look back at the rise and fall of recent title-winning Premier League bosses. Roberto Mancini \nMancini won the title with City in 2011-12, bringing a top-flight title to the blue side of Manchester for the first time in 43 years. The final day was among the most memorable in history, as Man City clinched the title with a comeback win against QPR in stoppage time to fend off their crosstown rivals for the crown. \nMancini almost made it to the finish line of the next season, but the ax dropped on May 13. United ran away with the league and a loss in the FA Cup final to Wigan two days earlier seemed to be what sealed his fate. After three-and-a-half years, his time was done. Sir Alex Ferguson \nThe great Sir Alex captured one last Premier League title in 2012-13, winning by an incredible 11 points. He retired, of course, so he didn't manage the Red Devils the following season. Still, his handpicked successor, David Moyes, didn't fare very well. \nIn the following season, sans Ferguson, the Red Devils plummeted all the way down to 7th place. Moyes didn't last past April, and caretaker Ryan Giggs didn't impress enough to get the full-time gig. Watching Manchester City hoist the title probably didn't help matters. Jose Mourinho \nMourinho's return to Chelsea in 2014-15 was greeted with massive fanfare from Blues fans. In true \"Special One\" fashion, he delivered the Premier League title to Chelsea in Year One of Mourinho Part Deux. They clinched with three games still to play, and it looked like a dawning of a reborn era in London. \nThe sun set quickly on that honeymoon. As quickly as Mourinho had rebuilt Chelsea, they crumbled. With a title defense looking impossible, the Blues dumped Mourinho before Christmas in 2015-16. They'd lost nine of 16 EPL matches, and Guus Hiddink was called in as caretaker. Claudio Ranieri \nAs orchestrator of arguably the most miraculous title in sports history, Ranieri ingratiated himself with fans and players alike. Even non-Leicester City fans loved the man and his jovial personality. The Foxes ran to the most unlikely Premier League title in 2015-16 and nary a murmur or complaint really came from anywhere. \nThe following season didn't hold the same magic for Ranieri. The results weren't coming, and the team looked lost or just misguided. The rumors of Ranieri's tenure coming to an end came to fruition on Feb. 23. Mired in a relegation battle (but somehow still alive in the Champions League), the Foxes parted ways with Ranieri. It was a difficult choice, but ultimately probably the right one .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:36:45.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
