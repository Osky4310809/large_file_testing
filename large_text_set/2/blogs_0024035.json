To make matters worse, this sit down came mere moments after the 59-year-old spewed all kind of B.S. to the crowd at CPAC. In addition to vowing to \"make American education great again,\" Secretary DeVos took shots at the mainstream media — to only then turn around and say that First Amendment rights need to be defended. We know, we're confused too.\nThe businesswoman started off by noting:\n\"You may have heard some of the 'wonderful' things the mainstream media has called me lately. I, however, pride myself on being called a mother, a grandmother, a life partner, and perhaps the first person to tell Bernie Sanders to his face that there's no such thing as a free lunch. The media has had its fun with me, and that's OK. My job isn't to win a popularity contest with the media or the education establishment here in Washington. My job as Secretary of Education is to make education work for students.\"\n*eye roll* We'll believe it when we see it.\nAfter discussing her hopes for equality opportunity for all students — which we don't entirely believe since they just alienated an entire student population — Betsy began discussing freedom of speech in colleges. She continued:\n\"How many of you are college students? The fight against the education establishment extends to you too. The faculty, from adjunct professors to deans, tell you what to do, what to say, and more ominously, what to think. They say that if you voted for Donald Trump, you're a threat to the university community. But the real threat is silencing the First Amendment rights of people with whom you disagree.\"\nUmmm, lady. It's YOUR administration going around calling celebrated news organizations \"fake news.\"\nAre all of Trump's lackeys this delusional?
