And so I want them to be sure.” \n“I think it’s unfair if they don’t know. And I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation,” Trump added, according to the New York Post .

The way the mainstream media is playing this up is that they had an influence in the election,” Spicer said, according to the U.K. Daily Mail . “There is zero evidence that they actually influenced the election.” \nLack of evidence didn’t stop the media from breathlessly reporting on the latest Russian hacking “scare,” this time up in Vermont. The Washington Post reported on New Year’s Eve that the Russians had managed to hack into the U.S. electrical grid via a Vermont utility. The story was reported across the media with dire urgency. \nThen, The Washington Post’s correction/ retraction was covered with considerably less urgency: Editor’s Note : An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid. Authorities say there is no indication of that so far. The computer at Burlington Electric that was hacked was not attached to the grid.
