Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nOne of Germany's top newspapers has led a brutal European reaction to Theresa May's Brexit speech. \nThe front page of Die Welt features the Union Jack-surrounded Prime Minister branded with the logo of BBC comedy Little Britain. \nBrexit Secretary David Davis was confronted with the front page on live TV this morning as he tried to deny Britain wants to \"have its cake and eat it\". \nThe PM has said Britain will leave full membership of the single market and customs union - and walk away without a deal if it's not good enough. Read More \nThat led Spanish newspaper ABC to warn \"May threatens the EU with a commercial war\". Italian daily La Repubblica wrote \"London gets its wall\" and Czech daily Dnes had an unflattering photo of the PM headlined \"no compromise\". \nYet despite the hostile reaction Mr Davis claimed: \"I think it’s gone down incredibly well.\" \nIn a round of interviews this morning, Sky News presenter Sarah-Jane Mee compared the front page to the Daily Mail, whose headline was \"steel of the new iron lady\". \nAnd she questioned him on the headline in The Times, which portrayed Mrs May's warning as \"give us a fair deal or you'll be crushed\". \nMr Davis replied: \"That’s The Times, that’s not the Prime Minister.\" Read More Tory Brexit Secretary David Davis reveals he made £1,000 betting on Leave \nHe clashed with the presenter over his plan to steamroller ahead with Brexit even if MPs vote his \"tough negotiation\" down. \nHe claimed losing a final vote in Parliament in 2019 was \"utterly hypothetical\" and \"I intend to win it\". David Davis on Sky News (Photo: Sky News) \nBut questioned on what he'd do if he does lose, he told ITV's Good Morning Britain: \"We will leave anyway.\" \nHe even boldly claimed: \"It won’t go wrong. We’re very clear what we’re going to do, we’re very clear what we want out of this and it’s in everybody’s interests. \n\"Why on earth can it go wrong?\" \nMr Davis said ministers \"want a tariff-free deal\" with the EU single market, a key demand of Labour. \nAnd asked if Brits' holidays in the EU would be affected, he claimed: \"You won’t see any difference let’s say in the right to travel.\" \nBut he did not rule out his \"phased\" transition taking five years after the Brexit deadline of March 2019. David Davis on Good Morning Britain (Photo: ITV) \nAsked if it would stretch beyond the 2020 general election he said: \"I could imagine that\". \nHe admitted lorries could face customs checks, saying: \"We'll see, that's one of the things we want to negotiate.\" \nHe said the idea of Scotland staying in the single market was \"technically difficult\" and \"would not be accepted\". \nAnd asked how much Britain would carry on paying into the EU, he told LBC: \"I'm not going to answer a question like that\".
