big name Spurs opted for over Diego Maradona, plus the nice gesture Arsenal showed Sutton. \nIt’s Wednesday’s Paper Talk. \nREVEALED: HOW CLOSE SPURS CAME TO SIGNING MARADONA \nFORMER Tottenham and Manchester United striker Teddy Sheringham has revealed how close Spurs came to signing Diego Maradona when he was at the club. \nSpeaking on Youtube channel Stadium Astro , Sheringham said former manager Osvaldo Ardiles had approached him about the possibility of signing the Argentine legend. \n“I got on really well with Ossie, and I think I was the captain at the time, and Ossie came to me one day and said ‘I want your opinion, I’m thinking about signing someone’,” Sheringham said. \n“And I was like ‘go on’ and he was like ‘Diego Maradona’, and I went ‘Ossie, Ossie, really!? Are you?’ I went ‘do, just do it’. \n“He said ‘I’m in talks with him at the moment’ and I was like ‘my god, do it, it would be brilliant to play with him’. \n“So he came to me about three days later and was like ‘I’ve decided not to sign Diego, he’s got too much baggage around him’.” \nThat said, Ardiles didn’t allow Sheringham’s disappointment to linger for too long. \nAfter electing not to sign Maradona, he instead went out and got German legend Jurgen Klinsmann. media_camera Tottenham Hotspurs' Jurgen Klinsmann celebrates a goal. \nThe World Cup winner went on to play 41 games for Tottenham, scoring 21 goals. Not a bad back-up option at all. \nSANCHEZ’S ‘MIND IS MADE UP’ \nThere has been plenty of speculation around Alexis Sanchez’s future. \nNow one big-name football writer believes the Arsenal striker has made the decision to leave the London club. media_camera Alexis Sanchez. \nMirror chief football writer John Cross says Sanchez, who is out of contract at Arsenal in 2018, is set to depart in the summer transfer window. \nHowever, Cross also believed fellow star Mesut Ozil was more likely to stay at the Emirates. \n“I think Sanchez will go,” Cross said. \n“His mind’s made up. I think there’s big clubs in for him — PSG, Juventus as well.” \n“But I do think Ozil is much more likely to stay and sign a new deal than Sanchez.” \nGUNNERS’ NICE GESTURE TO SUTTON \nThey came away from Sutton United with a two-goal victory. \nBut Arsenal left behind a priceless memory for its FA Cup opponent. \nThe players all left their shirts from the match behind, to be distributed among the Sutton playing group.

It is a justified decision, out of respect to the team, the supporters and the club. And the matter is closed,” Allegri told reporters in Portugal on Tuesday. \n“It is my decision and I have informed the club. Bonucci understood because he is an intelligent boy and an important player for Juventus.” \nThe Italy defender exchanged heated words with Allegri at the end of last Friday’s 4-1 win over Palermo in Serie A and has since been fined by Juve. \nAllegri accepted that his own conduct had been “inappropriate” in the affair and revealed he would be making a donation to charity to atone. \nSMERTIN NAMED ANTI-RACISM WATCHDOG \nRussian football has put former Chelsea midfielder Alexei Smertin in charge of its investigations inton racism as the country seeks to clean its image ahead of the World Cup next year. \nSmertin, also an ex-captain of the national team, has been named inspector on racism and discrimination.

Authorities are often accused of turning a blind eye to abuse of black players. \nSmertin stirred controversy by insisting that racism “does not exist” in his homeland and that the media was misrepresenting the abuse. \n“There’s no racism in Russia, because it does not exist,” Smertin, who turned to politics after retiring in 2008, told the BBC in a 2015 interview. \n“Racism in Russia is like fashion. It comes from abroad, from different countries,” he said. \n“It was never, ever here before. Ten years ago, some fans may have given a banana to black guys — it was just for fun.” \nRussia will host the World Cup between June 14 and July 15 at 12 stadiums in 11 cities including Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi. \nThe four cities are also the hosts of the 2017 Confederations Cup that kicks off on June 17, with the final in Saint Petersburg on July 2. \nLUKAKU FUELS MORE TRANSFER SPECULATION \nEverton star Romelu Lukaku has made no secret of his belief he has unfinished business at Chelsea. \nThe striker’s latest tweet indicates he’s putting the feelers out to let big clubs know he’s keen to play more top-flight football.
