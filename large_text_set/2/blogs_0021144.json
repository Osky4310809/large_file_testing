Thanks to the Redbull-charged stylists, a little technique called layering has been incorporated in styling, and body cons been foregone for forgiving fits (that aren’t typically heroine-like). Not so new but persistent to this glam-detox party is the label péro.

Kangana Ranaut was recently snapped in a plaid sari by the label that treaded the commercially-offbeat path rather convincingly. While in most cases, especially with celebrities, it’s a meet-halfway scenario – sensibilities are slightly compromised to match a certain stature of stardom in the name of customisation – for designers.

None of it has been tweaked to fit a celebrity style. However loved, there haven’t been any easily marketable slits, waist-cutouts, or whatever the next big trend that there was. “We’ve never gone out of the way or done anything according to the brief\", Aneeth clarifies, \"whatever they’ve chosen, it’s from our existing line. Till today, we’ve not followed a brief from a celebrity. It has always been them (stylists) approaching us.” \nPéro contnues to be the OG brand that overlooks the need of any element that threatens its relatable quality. “I don’t think there is anyone we’d like to change; we are evolving with time, says Aneeth, while talking about the brand’s aesthetic. Our clothes are becoming more and more uncomplicated. As far as the ideology of the brand goes, I don’t think we’d want to change anything.” See you at the mumbai péro sale #Day3📍The Vintage Garden❤️ 🗓6-8th January 11AM-8PM #mumbaiperosale ✈️LINK IN BIO #heartspotting #love #peopleofpero #fatimasanashaikh #dangal #actor #mumbailove #thevintagegarden A post shared by p é r o ® (@ilovepero) on Jan 7, 2017 at 9:09pm PST \nThe real-body endorsement isn’t a hard-hitting CSR activity, but an unrelenting sensibility. “Since the time I have started my brand, it hasn’t been about standing out or making a statement, it has been about gelling in. It is about being comfortable and looking stylish because you are comfortable in carrying yourself confidently. I feel, this is not a trend\", says Aneeth. \nSo when Kareena, notwithstanding her pregnancy, declined to compromise on style, péro was one of her consistent choices. Through her refreshingly-public course of motherhood, the actress layered languidly-fitting dresses and threw oversized coats on top… a style statement that we have never seen the otherwise glamorous actress make. #actress #kareenakapoorkhan in #Péro ♥️ #peopleofpéro #love #Repost @kareenakapoorkhanbegum with @repostapp ・・・ Cutest!

Though, the designer is not sure if the actress, who is now racing back to her fitter self, will wear the brand for her post-pregnancy style. \nThe designer is also quick to point out that the brand has never consciously chosen a celebrity for their clothes, “It has never been like ‘okay Kareena is in the forefront now, so we’ll send her something’. It is always the stylists who approach us.\" we ❤️ actress Kangana Ranaut at her relaxed and stylish best wearing péro fall-winter 2016 lace dress and block print reversible coat. #FW16 #PippiGoestoPoppyFields #madeinindia #peopleofpero #handmadewithlove styled by Ami Patel A post shared by p é r o ® (@ilovepero) on Jan 23, 2017 at 11:52pm PST \nIt's safe to assume that Bollywood has self-invited itself to this pared-down, real-girl péro fest. The not-so-glamorous dresses, sported by the millennial girls – the likes of Yami Gautum, Kriti Sanon , Radhika Apte Shweta Tripathi – have been mindfully chosen. Neha Dhupia, who has long been the flag berarer of body-positivity is oft seen endorsing the same in péro’s signature fluffy dresses, layering them with fluffier coats from the brand. we ❤️ actress @shraddhakapoor in #Upcycle #denim jacket from #péro fall-winter 2016 #peopleofpéro styled by Sanam Ratansi @style.cell #madeinindia #pippigoestopoppyfields #poppyflowers #fw16 #poppyappeal A post shared by p é r o ® (@ilovepero) on Nov 11, 2016 at 1:51am PST ♥️ #peopleofpéro Shweta Tripathi #MAMI #Repost @battatawada with @repostapp ・・・ How can one not ❤️ @ilovepero All happy and 👯for the @mumbaifilmfestival @oxfam_india #WomenInFilm brunch #MAMI16 #péro A post shared by p é r o ® (@ilovepero) on Nov 2, 2016 at 8:58am PDT \nAneeth spells this fixation out, “The celebrities, who are choosing péro, somewhere have that sensibility… not because everyone’s wearing it. We are definitely not choosing them because they are the call of the hour.” \nFunnily enough, Aneeth goes on to address the (in)famous phenomenon of #AirportDressing. “When I was starting my brand, I used to think how do they travel in what they are wearing? But I have seen a very drastic change from the way people used to dress initially. Now, they are making a statement through comfort clothing. Now, it has become a trend – dressing for the occasion.” \nIt’s evident that these ladies, who decidedly rule our wardrobes, are not wearing just another token anti-fit dress. In some way or the other, sporting péro enables their sartorial rebellion to shut down the regressive standards of Bollywood dressing. \nOn being questioned about her favourite celebrity, Aneeth has a swift response, “Kiran Rao! The way she wears it, it doesn’t look like much effort has gone into matching the shoes or wearing a coordinated bag with it. Everything’s just thrown on.” In one word: effortless. Which is exactly how péro meant to be worn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:02:46.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
