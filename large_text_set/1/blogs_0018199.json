(Richard B. Levine/Newscom) Reprints \nWalgreens Boots Alliance ( WBA ) and Rite Aid ( RAD ) fell in the stock market today after Bloomberg reported that the Federal Trade Commission is not satisfied with the drug stores' proposed offer to win approval for their merger. \nRite Aid had proposed selling 865 stores to smaller rival Fred's ( FRED ) to ease antitrust concerns for Walgreen's $9-a-share offer first announced in October 2015. But FTC officials don't believe that goes far enough, Bloomberg reported , citing sources. \nWalgreens fell 2.7% to 81.25 in late afternoon trade. \nRite Aid crashed 13.3% to 7.46 after briefly being halted and falling as low as 6.95. The stock tumbled through its 50-day and 200-day lines. \nFred's sank 3.5% to 15.59. Fred's shot up 81% to 20.19 on Dec. 20, when the Rite Aid store deal was announced, but has pulled back substantially since then. \nCVS Health ( CVS ) lost 2%. \nRite Aid shares had shot up last week on a New York Post report that regulators were expected to OK the deal before President Obama left office. \nRite Aid could fall to 3.50 or less if the Walgreens deal falls through, Evercore ISI said. \nBut some analysts speculate that the GOP-led FTC under the Trump administration will be more favorable toward a Walgreens-Rite Aid deal. President Trump will have three seats to fill on the five-person board once FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez steps down on Feb. 10. \nThe Walgreens-Rite Aid has a Jan. 27 expiration date. If the deal isn't approved by then and the timeline isn't extended, Walgreens would owe a termination fee of $325 million, or $650 million under \"certain circumstances.\" \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T01:47:27.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
