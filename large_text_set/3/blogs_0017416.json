(MichalLudwiczak/Getty Images/iStockphoto) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   7:00 AM \nMost people are decent or at least deserve the benefit of the doubt. But not everyone. There are those whose behavior is obnoxious and egregious enough to merit red-hot hate. Like these 10 — and no, we don’t feel bad about this. \n* The person who uses public space — a park bench, bus, waiting area — to clip their nails. Hell no. \n* The barista who takes your order, flirts with another customer, then forgets your latte — and now we’re 20 minutes late for work. Flirt less, barista more. (jacoblund/Getty Images/iStockphoto) \n* The person who uses the outdoor voice at the nail salon, library, office, wherever. We don’t care what you did, your boss said or how cute your kids are. STFU! \n* The mother-in-law, who’s just called 10 times to find out what you’re bringing over for the potluck dinner that’s two months away. We already told you — apple pie. Jeez. We get it - you're the best. And the worst. (wundervisuals/Getty Images) \n* The girl named Summer who’s in front of you in the Core Strength class wearing just a sports bra in the dead of winter. We get it, we’re fat. But you’re awful. \n* The person who’s always late — for everything. We understand it takes time to look as good as you do. But c’mon. Set your alarm for f’s sake! Do you mind if my pooch pees in peace? Jeez, people! (valentinrussanov/Getty Images) \n* The person living vicariously through others’ dogs. Leave Bowser and his master alone. The pooch deserves to take a pee in peace. \n* The social media grouser who complains about EVERYTHING in public view. Misery doesn’t love company when you’re trying to get a refund, a deal, something. Sorry, not sorry — but you’ve just been unfriended. \n* The mom and/or dad who lets their kids run wild in the restaurant on Sunday morning while we’re just trying to keep our booze-addled brain inside our head. \n* The unprepared shopper fishing around for change and their Extra Care Card at the store. My milk just expired waiting for you. Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T13:24:13.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
