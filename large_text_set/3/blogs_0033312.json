Non-league side Beer Albion fly into the record books after scoring in just 2.5 SECONDS at the weekend \nChris Long struck unstoppable effort directly from kick-off in Devon & Exeter Premier League clash against Newton St Cyres By Dave Fraser 30th March 2017, 10:28 am Updated: 30th March 2017, 1:40 pm Comments NON-LEAGUE side Beer Albion flew into the record books this weekend… after scoring in just 2.5 SECONDS. \nThe Devon and Exeter Premier League side were hosting Newton St Cyres on Saturday, with the crowd barely settled in before the game’s first goal. 3 Non-league side Beer Albion scored after just 2.5 seconds on Saturday \nWith the new rules regarding kick-off, Chris Long opted to unleash a speculative effort directly from the halfway line… only for the ball to nestle in the back of the net. \nKeep up to date with ALL the football news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary. \nOn the ridiculous moment, Beer chairman John Moughton said: “With the new regulation of the way you kick-off, it’s perhaps easier to have a quick shot and catch the goalkeeper unaware. \n“The ball was passed to Chris Long. He does have a very sweet foot and he shoots and scores a lot of goals from long range, but even for him this is fairly unusual occurrence, but it set us up for a good game, scoring so early. Youtube 3 Vuk Bakic from Serbia scored after just 2.2 seconds back in 2012 \n“[The goalkeeper] wasn’t too far off his line, but the power of the shot, with the wind that was up there saw it go completely over his head. He wasn’t the tallest goalkeeper in the world.” \nIt was the perfect start for Beer, who went on to win the game 3-2, and Moughton reckons it won’t be beaten. \n“It’s almost physically impossible to beat that. \n“It was interesting standing on the line next to the Newton St Cyres manager, he was shouting at his players because of the wind to be mindful from the kick-off to be aware, and obviously his words fell on deaf ears because he caught the keeper out. Action Images 3 Ledley King scored the fastest ever Premier League goal, netting after just 9.9 seconds against Bradford back in 2000 \n“We were Obviously delighted, but surprised; we’ve never seen anything like that before, so it was a good start to the game, one that we were keen to win, and I think everyone enjoyed the moment.” \nMeanwhile, Beer club secretary Roger Hoare said the goal was very much wind-assisted, saying: “There is quite a wind at the ground. \n“Just before kick-off, there was a gale of wind from east to west which is where he was shooting, so that helped it go in. there was stunned silence everywhere.” \nThe goal proved to be decisive, as Beer Albion ultimately ran out 3-2 winners to move into eighth spot – out of 15 – in the league table.
