During the chat, Moynihan talked about how his company grew during 2016 and much more.\nSee also: SoC showdown 2016: Snapdragon 821 vs Exynos 8890 vs MediaTek Helio X25 vs Kirin 960 4 weeks ago During the chat, Moynihan stated that MediaTek actually puts a lot of time and effort on software and system solutions development, on top of its more well known hardware business. He says that gives the company a way to offer a better end-user experience.\nMoynihan said that MediaTek can also offer hardware for a wide level of devices. Amazon is one of the biggest customers for the company, as it users MediaTek SoC solutions in its low cost Fire tablets in combination with its Fire OS. However, Moynihan says that other companies with different needs will get different types of support.\nThe company’s Helio X and Helio P processors have gotten more and more attention. The Helio X series, with its high-performance specs, and the Helio P series, with somewhat lower performance but with a balance of lower power consumption, are now taking up as much as 20 percent of MediaTek’s volume, according to Moynihan. Part of the reason is the rise of Chinese OEMs who are embracing the use of those chips.\nMoynihan also talked about where he sees smartphones going in the near future. He says that while overall growth worldwide might be slowing, large markets like India and China still have tons of growth potential. Also, while high-end premium phone sales may be slowing, there might still be growth in the mid and lower end smartphones, along with the growth of using unlocked phones in the US.\nBe sure to check out the entire chat with MediaTek’s Finbarr Moynihan at our YouTube channel, and stay tuned for even more interviews with top executives from CES 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:10:20.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
