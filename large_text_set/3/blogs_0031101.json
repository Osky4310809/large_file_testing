Whereas mutual funds trade at only one price throughout the trading day, ETFs trade in similar fashion to equities , in many cases with constantly changing prices. This advantage also turned into a criticism, as ETF naysayers alleged that the asset class would turn ordinary investors into day traders . Unfortunately for ETF critics, data indicate that investors are buying and holding ETFs. \n\"As ETFs have become more popular holdings, the average ETF was held for 26 months in advisory accounts, while it was 19 months for retail accounts. Digging more deeply, investors were even more patient with U.S. and international equity ETFs than taxable fixed income ones,\" said CFRA Research , citing data from fund giant Fidelity, in a note out Monday.

Investors have added money to U.S. ETFs in 12 consecutive months. At the end of February, exchange-traded products (ETPs) including ETFs listed on global exchanges had a combined $3.84 trillion in assets under management , Investopedia reported earlier this month . \nWhile intraday liquidity is a valid selling point when it comes to ETFs, the factor that is more prominent in terms of driving money to ETFs is fees. ETFs usually have significantly lower fees than actively managed mutual funds – and that matters to buy-and-hold investors.

IVV charges just 0.04 percent per year, or $4 on a $10,000 investment, making it one of the least expensive broad-market ETFs in the U.S. (See also: Another ETF Joins the $100B Club .)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:14:34.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
