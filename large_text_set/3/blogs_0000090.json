Refuse to take part in any future White House briefings based on an invitation list of who's in/who's out.\" \nThe petition was due to be delivered on Wednesday. An ABC News representative did not immediately return a call seeking comment. \nSignees include Reagan-era White House correspondent Sam Donaldson and former ABC reporters Ken Kashiwahara, Jeanne Meserve and Lynn Sherr. Among the executives are four former executive producers of \"World News Tonight\" and top leaders at \"Nightline,\" ''20/20\" and \"Good Morning America.\" Prominent news executives Rick Kaplan, Bill Lord, Paul Friedman, Av Westin and Tom Yellin signed, along with documentarian and the late anchor Peter Jennings' widow, Kayce Freed Jennings. \nThe letter called last Friday's incident \"an alarming new development enacted by an administration that has declared war on respected news outlets.\" \nTrump has included ABC News in his labeling of media organizations that are the \"enemy of the American people\" and \"fake news.\" ABC was included in Spicer's briefing last Friday, where access was denied to CNN, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Politico and BuzzFeed. Reporters from other organizations, including The Associated Press, USA Today and Time magazine, refused to attend the briefing in protest. \nIn calling for Goldston to speak out, the letter from former ABC Newsers noted a strong public protest by Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, and statements by The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg that they would not participate in future briefing where reporters are barred.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T18:15:35.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
