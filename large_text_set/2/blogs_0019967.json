However, if we turn the pages of history, India-Australia contests weren't counted as one of the most intense rivalries going around. Australia visited the shores of India on only six occasions until 1998. It was only at the turn of the century, the rivalry between the two countries shifted to top gear. \nSince 2000, there have been moments of individual brilliance that tipped the scales in favour of one team over the other. Over a period of time, the fierce rivalry between the two nations has also been interspersed with verbal duels, Monkey-gate and other on-field spats. \nAt Eden Gardens in 2001, we saw VVS Laxman at his wristy and willowy best when he composed a once-in-a-lifetime 281 to engineer a remarkable turnaround with India eventually winning the series. With his vivid brushstrokes-like willow, Laxman seemed to be bisecting the gaps at will, as if taking the mickey out of Shane Warne and Co. In the same series, Harbhajan Singh's sustained brilliance over three Tests fetched him a whopping 32 scalps. If we jog our memory down the lane further, then Sachin Tendulkar took his batting to compelling heights by destroying Warne in 1998. \nWhat about their opponents, Australia? From time to time, the likes of Glenn McGrath, Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Adam Gilchrist and Co. have epitomized sheer bloody-mindedness and never-say-die-attitude that one associates with the Australians to get to the job done. Their most memorable show in India came in 2004 when the Gilchrist-led Australian side (Ponting captained in only one Test) overcame the hosts in their own den to win their first series in India since 1969. \nSo what is in store for the latest installment of their rivalry when the two nations lock horns against each other in the first Test of the four-match series in Pune? In spin-friendly conditions, the Indian juggernaut has been on a roll in the recent past. Under the able leadership of Virat Kohli, the Indian set-up has already won series against England and New Zealand (also emerging triumphant in the one-off Test against Bangladesh). \nThe duo of Ashwin and Jadeja has combined to snare a staggering 110 Test wickets during the ongoing home summer. The pacers have chipped in with crucial wickets too. Among the batsmen, Kohli himself has touched splendid heights, notching up four double centuries, while Pujara, Vijay and Co. have put up consistent performances. Even the lower order has provided India with vital contributions. \nSo as Steve Smith, the Australian captain said in a press conference, the visitors will start as 'the underdogs in this series'. The last time they played in Asia, Australia lost 0-3 to an inexperienced Sri Lankan line-up. Moreover, they also suffered a stinging 0-4 series loss in India in 2013. \nThe tourists' batting will revolve around Warner and Smith (Khawaja has had his issues against offspin). With a slew of close-in fielders hovering around the bat, it would test the temperament of the visiting batsmen. Mitchell Starc, the pace spearhead, has to lead the bowling attack. It wouldn't be easy for the New South Welshman as pacers haven't exactly generated reverse swing during this Indian summer. Nathan Lyon, who has largely struggled on turning tracks of Asia, also needs to raise his stakes. \nSo India will clearly start as favourites. But this is also an opportunity for the relatively inexperienced Australian side to draw from their deep reserves of willpower and put up a fine show. \nTeam combinations: \nWith the track expected to offer assistance for the spinners, India could pick Jayant Yadav as the third spinner to back up Ashwin and Jadeja. For the tourists, Lyon, O'Keefe and Swepson (the debutant) might turn out to be the spin trio. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:14:18.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
