Terra will be a full-service restaurant offering a seasonal menu of shareable plates, plus wine and cocktails. With an open dining room, the restaurant will be filled with green plants and rustic-style design elements. Bergamot and BISq alum Dan Bazzinotti (Eater Boston’s 2015 Chef of the Year ) will serve as chef de cuisine at Terra, which means “land” in Italian. The restaurant’s menu draws its inspiration from earthy ingredients and includes dishes such as marinated grilled sirloin steak, grilled quail, and fried seafood, in addition to meat and vegetable skewers cooked on the wood-fired grill. There will be assorted bruschette and pasta dishes available as well. In addition to wine and cocktails, Terra will offer barrel-aged beers. The restaurant will have a designated room with space for 15 wooden barrels and has partnered with breweries like Dogfish Head and Cambridge Brewing Company. Terra will join three other full-service restaurants at Eataly, which opened on Boylston Street in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T08:00:28.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
