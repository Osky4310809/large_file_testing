Giphy \nRushing in to sit in the “front seat” with Corden, Blue Ivy was all smiles, exuding more confidence and joy than any of the sorry-for-themselves Grammy nominees and winners hanging their tails between their legs while Neil quietly thought to himself, “You played this song at all your weddings, assholes!” \nAh, Blue. If only you had a platform and resources available to you to soar into super-fame and make millions of dollars to create beautiful things we all will love.
