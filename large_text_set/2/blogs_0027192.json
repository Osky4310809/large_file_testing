Read more Danish man charged with ordering rape of 346 children in ‘historic’ livestream sex abuse case \nKyle Parker, 23, was drinking with the victim’s uncle on the night of March 23, 2016, and after waiting for everyone else to fall asleep, he kidnapped the toddler. He then raped, beat and strangled the child before dumping her body along the shore of the White River near Gosport, 40 miles southwest of Indianapolis. \nParker plead guilty to kidnapping and murder at the beginning of February but his plea deal did not involve any charges of rape or sexual molestation of a minor. \nJudge Lori Thatcher Quillen explained the plea bargain by saying that while Parker had admitted his crimes, the main factors in accepting the plea deal were the lack of DNA evidence and the risks associated with seeking a harsher conviction which may not have stuck. \nThe autopsy report indicated that the victim suffered severe sexual trauma before dying from asphyxiation. \nJudge Quillen described Parker’s actions as “pure evil,” as cited by AP. \n\"When I found out she had been murdered, I wanted to find who was responsible for this. I wanted to die, too,\" the victim’s father told reporters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:05:26.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
