To download BetterSnapTool from the Mac App Store, you need a Mac with OS X 10.6.6 or later. Learn More. BetterSnapTool \nOpen the Mac App Store to buy and download apps. Description BetterSnapTool allows you to easily manage your window positions and sizes by either dragging them to one of the screen's corners or to the top, left or right side of the screen. This enables you to easily maximize your windows, position them side by side or even resize them to quarters of the screen. If you need even more than those standard snap areas, BetterSnapTool now allows you to create your own, custom snap areas anywhere on your display.To be even more productive you can also set custom keyboard shortcuts in order to move and resize your windows.Because there are so many positions available, BetterSnapTool can also pop up an overview menu from which you can select the one position you want.You can also customize what happens after right-clicking on one of the buttons on the top left of a window.More features included are:• move or resize the window below the cursor while holding customizable modifier keys.• select what happens when double-clicking a windows titlebarBetterSnapTool is very customizable and will change the way you work with your Mac!It supports multiple monitors, hidden docks etc..You can change the design of the preview overlays and even set application specific snapping sizes! BetterSnapTool works with almost every application, only some apps with non-standard windows can't be supported.I'm always open for new ideas, so don't hesitate and ask! What's New in Version 1.7 \n• Optimizations to make BetterSnapTool work well with the new macOS 10.12 Sierra• Added missing \"two thirds\" option (scroll down in the keyboard tab)• Various little bugfixes• Thank you all for supporting BetterSnapTool for so long! Screenshots Much better than macOS window docking and split implementation by ACGarland Without this app, I’d be very frustrated—having come from long-time use of Windows. This is one feature which Windows handles so much better than macOS: in a far more intuitive way and isn’t constantly forcing you to reach for the mouse or trackpad. And this app brings all that ease-of-use (and more) to the macOS environment. Even though macOS has support for snapping/docking windows and split-view, the implementation is quite lame: 1) no easy way to do it from the keyboard; 2) doesn’t work AT ALL unless you have thing set for each display to be treated as a separate space. (What?! I’ve got three displays and use 5 spaces and you want me to try to track 15 separate spaces just so I can reasonably snap and split views? No thanks: I prefer 5 spaces, each with the complete set of displays.) Anyway, this app doesn’t suffer from those shortcomings.One of my most-used apps since switching to the Mac. Remarkable Window Management App by KBeat For those looking at both, let me say I find this app far more useful than “Magnets” which largely just mimics screen orginazation tools already built in to macOS. Side by side and full screen views are easy to do by default. It’ll allow things like quarters, but that’s not a view I find terribly useful.BetterSnapTool on the other hand goes way above and beyond what the OS can do. From things like centering windows or having them take up ⅓, ½, or ⅔ of the screen on right or left (all with easily customizable keyboard shortcuts or window dragging) to compeltely customizable window arangments. Not simply snapping mind you, but exactly specified layouts.Simply the go-to app if you’re looking to manage your application, document, and finder windows beyond what macOS will do by default. It REALY Just Works! by Have-Used-App This application smoothly does the “fractions of the screen” window sizing and positioning (like the more publicized Magnet), but also lets you customize EVERYTHING, so that you can create window positioning that just suits how you work. In others words, if you’re into tweeking something until it does EXACTLY what you want, this is the app to get (or you can just use the defaults). I’ve always used Macs (going from mainframes to workstation Unix to Mac OS) and this app has been there, doing it’s thing, for as long as I can remember being on Mac OS. I must have selected it as one point, but it’s been so many releases ago that I can’t remember not having it around. AND, It’s ALWAYS JUST WORKED!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T05:06:34.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
