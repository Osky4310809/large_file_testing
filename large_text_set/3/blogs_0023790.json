Air X operates 17 passenger aircraft — including the world’s largest charter-operated private jet, the Airbus A340-300 — from bases in Malta, England and Austria. \nThe firm has grown rapidly, having had just four planes four years ago. It forecasts sales of around £80 million this year. It recently said it plans to expand into America and into the cargo transport sector. \nA stock-market flotation is a possibility in the near future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:34:29.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
