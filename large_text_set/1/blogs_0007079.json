The UN must end the absurd reality in which it supports bodies whose sole intent is to spread incitement and anti-Israel propaganda.\" \nCommenting on the announcement, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said: \"We have not been informed.\" \nIsrael's UN Mission said the cut in funding is the first in a series of steps under consideration by the foreign ministry in reaction to the recently passed resolution that termed the settlements \"a flagrant violation under international law\". \nThe UN vote was abstained by the administration of President Barack Obama, which faced criticism from Israel, its closest ally, as well as President-elect Donald Trump. \nREAD MORE: UN Security Council urges end to Israeli settlements \nThe Obama administration's decision to allow the UN vote was a sharp rebuke to a longstanding ally and a striking rupture with past US vetoes. Secretary of State John Kerry defended the abstention decision saying settlements were an obstacle to a two-state solution. \nThe Republican-dominated US House of Representatives on Thursday condemned the UN for criticising Israeli settlements. \nREAD MORE: US House condemns UN resolution on Israeli settlements \nIsrael's UN Mission said it would move forward on additional initiatives \"aimed at encouraging structural change within the UN with the ultimate goal of ending anti-Israel activities\" after Trump takes office on January 20. \nThe UN maintains that settlements are illegal, but UN officials have reported an influx in construction over the past months. The resolution formally preserved the international community's disapproval of Israeli settlement building.
