He caught 15-17 targets for 224 yards, 2 touchdowns and a 158 WR rating — 12 points higher than Chris Hogan, the second-highest player. Ten of his 15 catches resulted in a first down or touchdown, converting 5 of 9 on third down. Britt was very efficient after the catch, averaging 6.06 yards and in the top half of all qualifying receivers. Britt showed the ability to run the crossing route at every level, having an aDOT of 9.12, with his route depth as low as 3 yards and as high as 18.” \nThe report defines a crossing route as one where the receiver is “throttling down to settle between zones” during the play. \nBritt almost never missed on such targets, with as many touchdowns as he had missed targets.

In a press conference on Friday, the only receiver that new Rams head coach Sean McVay mentioned was Tavon Austin. \nSome speculate McVay will want to let “Fisher guys” like Britt and defensive back Trumaine Johnson test the market in free agency. \nBritt, 28, played a large part in what little success the Rams did have on offense in 2016. However, with an estimated market value of $6.4 million per season, Los Angeles may look to save money on its top receiver from last season.
