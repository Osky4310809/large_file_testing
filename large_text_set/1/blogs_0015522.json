As Pitchfork points out, the song is “The Makings Of You” from 1970’s Curtis , which Pecknold cited in a since-deleted Instagram post as an inspiration for Fleet Foxes LP4 . You may recognize “The Makings Of You” from when it was sampled on Jay Z and Kanye West’s Watch The Throne bonus track “The Joy.” Hear Pecknold’s cover below.
