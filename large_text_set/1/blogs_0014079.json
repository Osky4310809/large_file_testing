Yesterday, a news report surfaced where the director of Coffee with D, Vishal Mishra and makers had expressed their anguish on how their lead actor had ditched them by not promoting the film. They had spoken about how they were getting threats from the underworld relating to the project and Sunil’s decision to not promote the project was similar to giving in to their demands. Today, the comedian took to social media to clarify why he was not promoting the film. And his grouse is something many actors will relate to across the industry. He said that he was not shown the complete film. He says he is not keen to promote a project, when he has not seen it in the first place. Sunil plays the role of a journalist whose character seems to be inspired by Arnab Goswami. Zakir Hussain, who has done a number of films and shows plays Dawood Ibrahim. The film is about a journo’s journey into setting up an interview with the kingpin. Anjana Sukhani plays his wife in the comic caper. It is no secret that Sunil alloted hardly a day for the film’s promotions and it seems that his issues with the makers run deep.

Kal Kal karte Kalyug aa Gaya. \n— Sunil Grover (@WhoSunilGrover) January 19, 2017 \nThe issues with promotions began from The Kapil Sharma Show. Everyone was shocked that Sunil’s film would not be promoted on the numero uno comedy show. Many observed that even his Punjabi flick, Vaisakhi List barely got promoted for five minutes on the show. Questions were raised on his equation with Kapil Sharma but in an exclusive to Bollywood Life, he maintained that everything was hunky dory between them. He told us, “There were some issues about execution and time crunch. The Kapil Sharma Show is my show. I am not an outsider. I can also have a call on my film’s promotion. It is my call that the film does not get promoted on The Kapil Sharma Show.” Clearly, there seem to be serious issues with the film’s makers and Sunil. \nWhile some might say it is not right on his part to disown something he is a part of, we guess we will hear a lot more from both sides. Stay tuned to Bollywood Life for more updates… \nPublished: January 19, 2017 1:37 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T10:26:28.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
