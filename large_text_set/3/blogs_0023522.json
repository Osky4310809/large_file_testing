On social media, you name it – walking down the street. Football fans don’t seem to like me. \n“I just get on with it but when people are trying to cut your missus up while she’s driving along, with the kids in the back of the car. It’s not the best.

People get cut up but if there’s no cameras you’re screwed.” poll loading Who will win when England play Germany? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:15:01.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
