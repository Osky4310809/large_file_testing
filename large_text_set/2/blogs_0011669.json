She had been running for only about seven months after the birth of her son, Dakota, last March. The 43-year-old hadn’t logged a single hard workout until the month before the race and had decided to enter only two weeks out. \nThe course in Bend, Oregon, was covered with two feet of snow until volunteers shoveled it. On race day, Fairchild wiped out on a downhill in the first of three laps. “It was like I was doing a slip and slide—I was just scooting on my rear for at least 20 yards,” she says.   \nAfter that, however, things turned around for the former youth star—called by many the best female high-school runner of all time—when she swiftly returned to her feet and closed the gap on defending champion Grace Padilla. Fairchild went on to win by 50 seconds in 24:02. \nThe victory was made all the sweeter given what she’s been through since, 26 years prior, she held the USA junior cross country title. Relieved of the pressure her early success placed on her, Fairchild has rediscovered her love of competition over the past several years and found new avenues for racing into her 40s. Here, she shares what she’s learned about happy running for the long haul. \n1. Find a purpose and stay connected to it. \nBy the time she graduated from Boulder High School, Fairchild had twice won the Kinney Cross Country Championships (now the Foot Locker Cross Country Championships) in 1989 and 1990 and become the first U.S. high school girl to break 10 minutes for two miles. \nBut the years between Fairchild’s youthful dominance and masters comeback had their share of ups and downs. At 17, she lost her mother to cancer, an experience that “busted me wide open,” she says. \nThough she struggled through much of her collegiate career at the University of Oregon, she won the 1996 NCAA title in the indoor 3,000 meters and qualified for the Olympic trials in the 10,000 meters. “My dream was to be an Olympian. That’s what I lived for,” she says. \nShe won a national championship in the 5,000 meters in 1997 and ran the Olympic Trials Marathon in 2000 but never made the Games. She raced sporadically for about 10 years until 2008. \nBut she never lost her passion for the sport. “Running has always been a guiding light in my life,” she says. \nDuring the years she wasn’t competing, she began dedicating herself to mentoring younger runners. She coached high school and college teams, worked at running camps, and in 2007, launched her own, the Melody Fairchild Running Camp. \n2. Reframe your goals. \nFairchild didn’t bemoan opportunities lost—instead, she regained her competitive footing in new venues. In 2012, just shy of her 40th birthday, she made the U.S. Mountain Running Team. \n“I was the oldest woman on the team by at least five years, and in some cases close to 15,” she says. Nevertheless, she took eighth at the World Mountain Running Championships, helping the team to a gold medal. \nNow, she has her sights set on other ambitious targets: She’d like to race (and win) the Leadville 100, the legendary ultramarathon in the town where her father grew up. And then there’s the Masters Grand Prix, a series of nine races around the country in which runners can compete for age-graded awards and prize money. \nFairchild would have a head start on the 2017 circuit with her victory in Bend. But she’ll likely wait a bit longer to pursue either of these athletic achievements—she hopes, first, to have another child. \n3. Choose confidence over doubts. \nAfter Dakota’s birth, Fairchild had maxed out at a relatively meager 25 miles a week. With the unpredictability of an infant’s schedule, she couldn’t get into a rhythm with hard workouts until four weeks out. \nThough she wasn’t entirely sure about her fitness level entering the race, she did nail one key workout about two weeks beforehand—a six-mile run where she started at 7:30 pace and sped up every mile until she held on at a sub-6:00 clip for the last three minutes. So she chose to draw power from that, rather than dwell on the miles she’d missed.

It’s very gratifying to see the growth and the transformation as a person over the years, just not sweating the small stuff,” she says. “I’ve become really good at handling any insecure thoughts that come up and doing the mental training to do that.” \n4. Picture success. \nPart of that mental training involves using imagery. The night before the Bend race, she went to the course so she could picture herself successfully completing it—something she now tries to do before every competition. \n“I just spend time closing my eyes and visualizing myself with light feet and light heart floating over the course,” she says. “When we mentally rehearse what we want to do, we create a blueprint of it in our minds. If we really [rehearse] with intention and presence, when you’re actually running the race, it’s familiar territory to your nervous system.” \nShe doesn’t deny her talent and experience play a role in her current success. But, she says, the ability to continue evolving as a runner has helped her cover any gaps in her training. \n“There’s no good reason why I’ve run as fast as I have, given the training I’ve done as a master, for some of these races,” she says. “I try to tune in to myself on the day and see what’s called for. It’s a really creative thing for me.” \n5. Go with the flow. \nIn addition to her running camp, Fairchild helps out at Boulder High and directs a youth running program called the Boulder Mountain Warriors. In today’s young runners, Fairchild often sees echoes of herself at that age—rigid, tied to routine, and struggling with body image issues. \nShe hopes she can help save them some of the time she spent worrying by instilling in them the lessons it took her years to learn. She tells them not to worry about looking or training the way others expect them to but instead to follow their own instincts. \n“I like to tell kids that the secret is your happiness,” she says. “If you’re in your joy and you are feeling truly comfortable in yourself, you’re going to run great.” \nHaving a young child regularly reinforces this lesson for Fairchild. She can’t always count on a fine-tuned week of training, fueling, and resting—but she does have plenty of practice setting her ego aside and handling the unexpected that serves her well on race day. \n“I would recommend child rearing to anybody,” she says. “It is really good to have somebody else be the center of attention. Not like I went searching for it, but I definitely had my share of being the center of attention when I was a kid. It’s my son’s turn now, and I like that.” \n6. Just show up. \nFairchild says that though she’s honored to have claimed the title last weekend, she’d welcome even more competition. She often hears women in her age group express the belief they can’t continue to race well. \n“I tell them—you might have even won some money if you went to the race,” she says. “Show up, because the world needs you. The big world and the running world, especially female masters runners. There are fewer of us than there are men.” \nThough she savored the win, the best part of the Bend experience came afterward. Fairchild rushed to a friend’s house to shower, picked up her son, and headed back to the track to watch the junior women compete. She’ll coach them at the Junior World Cross Country Championships next month in Uganda. \nThough she wasn’t required to be there, she wanted to see her team cross the line. As they did, former USATF president Bill Roe surprised Fairchild by reminding the young runners their new coach had placed first in the nation herself in 1991, and then third at the Junior World Cross Country Championships in Antwerp, Belgium. \n“It brought tears to my eyes,” Fairchild says. “I feel like I’m living my dream to come full circle, be competing as a master, and be able to be a role model to these young women who can see me winning a race and having a baby. \n“I was just so psyched to be able to walk my talk.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:19:44.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
