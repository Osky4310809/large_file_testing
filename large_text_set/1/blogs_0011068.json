As Eater Vegas reports , the restaurant opened its doors Tuesday night on the second level of the hotel and casino, right next to fellow Momofuku Group concept Christina Tosi’s Milk Bar, which debuted in late December . Chef Michael Chen, a veteran of the Vegas dining scene, is leading the kitchen at the 200-seat restaurant. The interior features plenty of Las Vegas glitz, with custom neons hung over the bar and a dining room mural featuring Chang’s Instagram-famous dog , Seve. A private dining room overlooks the Strip and has custom carpet printed with the restaurant group’s signature peach.

A soup section on the menu includes kimchi stew and oxtail soup, sure to be well-received by the city’s hungover masses. And, since this is Vegas we’re talking about, there’s also fried chicken with caviar — Chang’s version of surf and turf.
