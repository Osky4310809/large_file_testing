Wednesday) is called Amy Schumer: The Leather Special , in honour of the very chic outfit she wears. And like always, body image is a key theme in her new set. Specifically the weight loss she was politely coerced into before filming Trainwreck.\n\"Somebody like explained to me, 'Just so you know, Amy, no pressure, but if you weigh over 140 pounds, it will hurt people’s eyes. I just bought it. I was like, 'Okay, I'm new to town. So I lost weight,\" she says according to People magazine.\nAfter a gruelling effort to shed weight, Schumer says she felt awful. \"I look very stupid skinny. My dumb head stays the same but then my body, like, shrivels and [I] just look like ... a Thanksgiving Day parade [balloon] of Tonya Harding ... Nobody likes it. It's not cute on me.\"\nAfter putting the weight back on once the film wrapped up, she says \"I got worried because it gets in your head — just everything on television and movies and magazines and the internet. I'm like, 'Oh, my god! Are men still going to be attracted to me?' And that's when I remembered ... they don't care.\"\n@netflix #theleatherspecial tomorrow\nA post shared by @amyschumer on Mar 6, 2017 at 11:09am PST\nAlso, she gives honourable mention to her father for bringing her back down to reality. \"My dad, like, has MS and is in a wheelchair and it's, like, I'm just psyched I can f—ing move,\" she says. \"How are you going to complain [about your imperfections?] Shut the f*ck up. You're alive. You can move. You feel good!\"\n\"I feel very good in my own skin,\" she concludes in the set. \"I feel strong. I feel healthy. I do. I feel sexy.\"\nYou are, mate!\nWATCH: Japan’s latest trend?
