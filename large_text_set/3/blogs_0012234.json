Osborne, Assistant Professor at the Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, US said, \"Many earlier studies haven't shown postpartum depression to be tied to actual levels of pregnancy hormones, but rather to an individual's vulnerability to fluctuations in these hormones and they didn't identify any concrete way to tell whether a woman would develop postpartum depression\". \nOsborne added, \"Every woman has high levels of certain hormones, including allopregnanolone, at the end of pregnancy, so we decided to look earlier in the pregnancy to see if we could tease apart small differences in hormone levels that might more accurately predict postpartum depression later\". \nFor the study, the team included 60 pregnant women between the ages of 18 and 45, all who had been previously diagnosed with a mood disorder. \nUsing the blood samples, the researchers measured the blood levels of progesterone and allopregnanolone, a by-product made from the breakdown of progesterone and known for its calming, anti-anxiety effects. \nNo relationship was found between progesterone levels in the second or third trimesters and the likelihood of developing postpartum depression. \nHowever, a link between postpartum depression and diminished levels of allopregnanolone levels in the second trimester was observed. \n(With IANS inputs) First Published: Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - 23:33 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T05:57:43.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
