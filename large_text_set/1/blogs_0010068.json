Donald Trump news conference: Notable moments Updated January 11, 2017 6:39 PM By Newsday.com staff with The Associated Press and Bloomberg News \nAdvertisement Advertise here \nIn a wide-ranging news conference a defiant President-elect Donald Trump discussed his relationship with Vladimir Putin, called BuzzFeed \"a failing pile of garbage\" and gave his plans for building a wall on the Mexican border and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Here are eight notable moments from the news conference on Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017 — his first in 167 days. Trump calls reports on compromising information 'phony stuff' (Credit: Newsday / J. Conrad Williams Jr.) \nTrump denied reports that Russia had compromising information about him. \n\"I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out. I saw the information, I read the information outside of that meeting,\" he said, a reference to a classified briefing he received from intelligence leaders. \"It's all fake news, it's phony stuff, it didn't happen.\" Trump: Putin shouldn't hack (Credit: AFP / Getty Images, 2016) \nTrump on what he would tell Russian President Vladimir Putin about hacking: \"He shouldn’t be doing it, he won't be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I’m leading it than when other people have led it.\" \nTrump said his relationship with Putin is an improvement over the United States’ current \"horrible relationship with Russia.\" \n\"If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks, that's called an asset, not a liability. I don't know if I'm going to get along with Vladimir Putin — I hope I do — but there's a good chance I won't,\" he said. Who will run the Trump Organization (Credit: Newsday / J. Conrad Williams Jr.) \nAddressing potential conflicts of interest, Trump announced that his two eldest sons — Donald Trump Jr., center, and Eric Trump, far left — would manage his businesses. \nLongtime Trump executive Allen Weisselberg will also manage and lead the Trump Organization, which will be put in a trust before Jan. 20, Trump attorney Sheri Dillon said. She indicated that Trump will maintain his ownership of it. She said \"you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses.\" (The Washington Post has an annotated news conference transcript here .) \nADVERTISEMENT Trump assails BuzzFeed and CNN (Credit: Media Pool) \nTrump called BuzzFeed \"a failing pile of garbage.\" The online news outlet published a summary of the unsubstantiated allegations that Russia had compromising information about Trump. \nThe president-elect called BuzzFeed and CNN \"fake news,\" and told CNN reporter Jim Acosta, \"Your organization is terrible, I'm not going to give you a question.\" Acosta replied, \"Mr. President-elect, that's not appropriate.\" 'I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai' (Credit: AFP / Getty Images / Karim Sahib) \nTrump said he turned down a $2 billion Dubai business opportunity because he didn’t want to have a conflict of interest after his election. \"Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very amazing man, a great developer from the Middle East,\" Trump said. \"I turned it down. I didn't have to turn it down.\" \nThe Trump International Golf Club Dubai in the United Arab Emirates is seen here on Aug. 12, 2015. 'Obamacare is the Democrats' problem' (Credit: Getty Images / iStockphoto) \nTrump said that a replacement for the Affordable Care Act would be offered \"essentially simultaneously\" with the repeal of the health law often referred to as Obamacare. Such a replacement would be virtually impossible to quickly pass given the complexity of the policy changes. \n\"Obamacare is the Democrats' problem,\" Trump said. \"We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them.\" Trump: 'We don't even have a border' (Credit: Newsday / J. Conrad Williams Jr.) \n“We don’t even have a border. It's an open sieve,\" Trump declared. \nThe president-elect, known for his tough talk on immigration, said that funding negotiations with Mexico on the wall would begin immediately after he takes office, that Mexico \"will reimburse us for the cost\" – and that \"We're going to start building.\" Supreme Court timeline (Credit: AP / J. Scott Applewhite, 2011) \nTrump said he expects to nominate a new Supreme Court justice within two weeks of taking the oath of office. He said voters supported him in part because he would nominate a conservative justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia. Senate Republicans blocked a hearing for President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. \nADVERTISEMENT Get the Newsday Now newsletter! \nThe best of Newsday every day in your inbox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:11:20.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
