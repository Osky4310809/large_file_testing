Park officials will monitor forecasts and decide within the next day or two whether the park can safely accommodate visitors and employees. \nPark officials advise that anyone planning travel to the park should make alternate plans if the park closes. \nA big flood in January 1997 caused extensive damage to roads, campgrounds, lodging and utilities in the park. The park remained closed until March 1997. Since that flood, the park worked to improve roads and facilities, according to the release. \nFor road and weather conditions for Yosemite National Park, call 209-372-0200 and press 1 or check the parkâ€™s website at www.nps.gov/yose", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:42:34.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
