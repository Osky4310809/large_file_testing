He said: “There was no real reason behind it, nothing hidden in my subconscious. It was a sort of escapism like drugs or alcohol. I don’t mean to be crass but it is addictive, like substance abuse. I still miss it, like alcoholics or drug abusers.” \nHe took up comedy nine years ago while studying at Southampton University and began using his struggles as material after several years on the circuit. But in 2015, despite being in therapy, “I wasn’t ready really and it was all too much. I relapsed and was sick again, so it has taken another couple of years to get here”.

But he said at his lowest weight he was suffering from heart issues and doctors told him his potassium levels were “very, very low”. \nNow well, the Brixton-based performer is touring his show Normally Abnormal and is on at Imperial College London tomorrow. He will be raising money for Beat, the UK’s leading eating disorder charity, before the start of Eating Disorders Awareness Week next Monday. He said: “I’m trying to use comedy to talk about something that is quite taboo, an informative talk using humour to make it more engaging. I want to approach the subject in an honest and candid way.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:24:08.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
