Technically it doesn't use official Post-It paper, but the sticky notes it prints are very similar. \nThe Nemonic is a thermal printer that exclusively prints sticky notes. Josh Miller/CNET \nUsing its app you can write down notes, use a pre-loaded template, or take a photo on your phone or smart device of choice, and then print it. \nThe Nemonic is a thermal printer -- like the ones that print your receipts at the grocery store -- except it only prints sticky notes. It prints really fast -- around five seconds -- and only in black and white. \nThe Nemonic comes in four colors. Josh Miller/CNET \nMangoslab claims that the thermal paper, which costs $4 a roll for about two hundred sticky notes and comes in 5 colors, will last 2 to 5 years without fading away. \nThe Nemonic is scheduled to go on sale in May or June for around $100 to $120. It'll be released in the US, Europe and Japan, and is scheduled to hit Australia and UK some time after.
