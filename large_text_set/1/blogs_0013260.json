Post to Facebook Obama: Sasha and Malia are taking Trump victory in stride President said his daughters realize 'democracy’s messy, and it doesn’t always work the way you might want.'  //usat.ly/2k1mZcn   Join the Nation's Conversation To   Obama: Sasha and Malia are taking Trump victory in stride Donovan Slack , USA TODAY 6:03 p.m. ET Jan. 18, 2017 \nThe Obama family arrives on Air Force One on Dec. 16, 2016, at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP) \nPresident Obama said Wednesday that daughters Malia and Sasha are taking President-elect Donald Trump’s win in stride, despite their mother’s excoriating Trump on the campaign trail for “bragging about sexually assaulting women” and her proclaiming that a Trump victory would validate such behavior. \n“They were disappointed; They paid attention to what their mom said during the campaign and believed it, because it’s consistent with what we’ve tried to teach them in our household, what I’ve tried to model as a father with their mom, and what we’ve asked them to expect from future boyfriends or spouses,” Obama said during his last press conference while in office. \n“But what we’ve also tried to teach them is resilience, and we’ve tried to teach them hope, and that the only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world. And so if you get knocked down, you get up, brush yourself off and you get back to work, and that tended to be their attitude.” \nFirst lady Michelle Obama delivered a blistering critique of Trump’s treatment of women after a tape surfaced in October featuring him talking in 2005 about grabbing and kissing women without asking. She said at the time, that “if we let Hillary’s opponent win this election, then we are sending a clear message to our kids that everything they’re seeing and hearing is perfectly OK. We are validating it. We are endorsing it. We’re telling our sons that it’s okay to humiliate women. We’re telling our daughters that this is how they deserve to be treated.” \nPresident Obama said Wednesday that Malia and Sasha “don’t mope” and they haven’t gotten cynical about the democratic process, despite the November loss. \n“They have not assumed that because their side didn’t win or because some of the values that they care about don’t seem as if they were vindicated that automatically America has somehow rejected them or rejected their values,” he said. “I don’t think they feel that way. I think they have — in part through osmosis, in part through dinnertime conversations — appreciated the fact that this is a big, complicated country and democracy’s messy, and it doesn’t always work the way you might want.” \nObama said he expected his daughters, while not considering a future in politics at this point, would be actively engaged as citizens. \n“Both of them have grown up in an environment where I think they could not help but be patriotic, to love this country deeply, to see that it’s flawed, but see that they have responsibilities to fix it,” he said. \nObama said that there are more good people than bad in the United States and a “core decency to this country.\" \n“They’ve got to be a part of lifting that up, and I expect they will be,” he said. “In that sense, they are representative of this generation that makes me really optimistic.” \nRead more: Posted!
