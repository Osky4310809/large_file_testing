There's fresh talent behind the camera, too, with J.A. Bayona ( The Impossible ) replacing Colin Trevorrow as director.\nBut the first photo isn't really concerned with any that, and you probably aren't right now either. So here's the photo, straight from Trevorrow (who co-wrote Jurassic World 2 ) on Twitter:\nWalking in giant footsteps. #JW2 pic.twitter.com/fOZrFXp9md\n— Colin Trevorrow (@colintrevorrow) March 8, 2017\nWhat the new photo lacks in action, it makes up for with awe — the kind you might feel in the middle of a natural history museum, say, when you've found yourself face to face with some awesomely large fossils.\nAn unidentified girl stares down a Triceratops skull at the center of a museum display. Surrounding them are the skeletons of other species, like what looks like a velociraptor off to the side.\nThe kid is perfectly safe here, of course — all these dinos are long dead — but knowing this franchise, she's sure to encounter live versions of these creatures very soon. At least this time, she and the rest of the cast will get to wear practical shoes while running for their lives.\nJurassic World is scheduled for release on June 22, 2018.\nWATCH: 7 things you didn't know about ‘Jurassic Park’ and ‘Jurassic World’", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/D8hkPZIP.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/JW2?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/colintrevorrow/status/839570082435108866", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/D8hkPZIP.m3u8", "https://t.co/fOZrFXp9md"], "published": "2017-03-09T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:00:25.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
