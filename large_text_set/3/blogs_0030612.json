Armed militants stormed into Jammu and Kashmir Minister of State for Hajj and Auqaf Farooq Andrabi's house in Dooru Anantnag late on Sunday night, India Today reported. The two policemen suffered bullet injuries, and have been hospitalised, India Today reported.   AP \nAccording to Greater Kashmir , police sources said that a group of militants opened fire at Andrabi's house.\"The militants resorted to heavy firing on the guard picket. The fire was retaliated by the policemen deployed there, triggering a brief gunfight in which two policemen sustained injuries.\" Speaking to Greater Kashmir, the DIG, South Kashmir Range, SP Pani said, \"Weapon snatching has also taken place. We are ascertaining how many weapons have been snatched,\" he said. \nDaily News & Analysis reported that Andrabi, a senior Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader who represents Dooru constituency in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, was not at his residence when the attack took place late on Sunday evening. This is the third militant attack that took place in different parts of central and south Kashmir on Sunday. \nDIG Pani, told Daily News & Analysi s that it seems like that the attack was apparently on the police guard and the intention could have been to snatch weapons. “It is his (Farooq Andrabi) ancestral home and he does not stay there. Apparently, two constables are injured and we are looking into it,” said Pani. \nThe strike comes hours after two Hizbul Mujahideen militants were killed early on Sunday after a brief gunfight in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district, police said. \nJammu and Kashmir has been put on high alert following these attacks that are taking place days ahead of the upcoming parliamentary by-elections in South Kashmir, according to NDTV . Polls in Srinagar and Anantnag will be held on 9 April and 12 April respectively. \nAccording to NDTV, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also expected to visit Jammu and Kashmir on 2 April for the inauguration of the Chenani-Nashri tunnel, where he will then address a public rally. \n  09:26   09:26 am Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:07:01.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
