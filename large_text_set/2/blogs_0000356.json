Keishi Hagio can be seen playing Suigetsu Hōzuki while Kanon Nanaki takes over Karin, the red-haired sensor. And, to round-out the trio, Tomoya Yamaguchi is seen in character as Jūgo. \nAnime fans will be familiar with the three ninjas as they were comrades to Sasuke after the Uchiha left Orochimaru. The group was known as Team Taka, and the trio eventually teamed up with the Akatsuki after Sasuke learned the truth about his older brother’s past once Itachi passed. \nSo far, the three photos are the only ones to be released following the play’s first release. Earlier this month, character photos of Sasuke, Naruto, and Itachi were revealed to plenty of online buzz. \nIf you want to see the musical for yourself, then you better get tickets to the show and to Tokyo. The production will be housed at the AiiA 2.5 Theater in Tokyo between May 19 and June 4. It will then run in Osaka between June 16-22 before returning to Tokyo in July.
