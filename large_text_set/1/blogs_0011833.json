Forced marriage is a violation of human rights... If this is not a policing priority then I am content at being dismissed Det Sgt Pal Singh \nI n an article on Nov 8, 2016, he raised concerns that a “politically correct” CPS was failing to pursue convictions over honour crimes for fear of causing “unrest” in Asian communities. After the article appeared, the Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC, made inquiries into the alleged failings by the CPS. \nHis comments were supported by charities and Theresa May responded by insisting there was “no honour in so-called honour crimes”. \nNow Det Sgt Singh, who believes he should be protected by whistleblower legislation, has been informed he must attend a misconduct hearing. \nHe told The Daily Telegraph : “Forced marriage is a violation of human rights, which invariably leads to marital rape and years of domestic abuse and modern slavery, with sometimes fatal consequences. If this is not a policing priority then I am content at being dismissed.” \nA notice served to Det Sgt Singh on Dec 8 deemed he dealt with the press “without seeking the relevant authority” and that his “comments may have had a detrimental effect on investigations”.

He told The Daily Telegraph : “The article made the MPS appear to be diligent, competent and tenacious.” However, Det Sgt Singh claimed, the CPS “were furious about the article”. \nThe Green Party’s Sian Berry, who sits on the Mayor’s police and crime committee, said: “This is a Met officer who worked hard on a lot of cases and noticed a pattern that concerned him. He raised a complaint to the CPS regarding this case and wasn’t satisfied with the response so went public about what he felt was part of a wider problem.” \nA CPS spokesman said: “Any decisions about disciplinary proceedings would be a matter for the Metropolitan Police.” \nThe Metropolitan Police confirmed it was investigating Det Sgt Singh for potential misconduct and refuted the claims made by him in his reaction to the notice. \nA spokesman said: “The MPS, like any organisation, expect its officers and staff to follow policies and procedures and investigate failures to do so.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:37:14.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
