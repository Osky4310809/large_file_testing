Then again, has the Pro Bowl ever had a shining moment? \nIf the NFL thought it was difficult luring players to Hawaii a week after the Super Bowl, what must the league be thinking after watching what unfolded in Orlando a week before the season’s final real football game? Naturally, the game featured no players from the NFL’s last two teams standing, including MVP favorites Matt Ryan and Tom Brady, and even Denver Broncos rookie quarterback Trevor Siemian turned down an invitation to participate in the league’s so-called all-star competition. \n[ Ditch the paper and pen – play Squares Pick’em for the Big Game! ] \nSo, we got a game that came down to the final minute — and still wasn’t all that interesting. The final sequence was all too fitting. Cousins threw an interception to Lorenzo Alexander. Alexander lateraled to Aqib Talib, who returned it 65 yards before being stripped by Cousins. That fumble led to a lengthy review and an eventual ruling in favor of the AFC. Mercifully, Philip Rivers kneeled on a 20-13 victory. \nYes, 33 total points. In a Pro Bowl. Announcer Sean McDonough’s final exasperation of the night was reminding those who watched at home on television that the game averaged 71 points from 2000-16. \nMore people may have watched inside the stadium, and that’s not saying much. Supposedly, there was a sellout crowd of 60,834 on hand to start the game, but by the second half, attendance was sparse: Welcome to Camping World Stadium!!!
