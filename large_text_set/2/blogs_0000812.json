The insults do not bother me, they’re like sticks and stones. I shrug them off, I chuckle at them, whatever.” \nBayless also joked about possibly hitting up his homie Lil Wayne if he ever records a response record after the collaboration is suggested by the reporter. \n“Now that you mentioned it, you just planted the seed in my mind,” he said. “Wayne might get a text from me later on today.” \nWatch the TMZ clip below.
