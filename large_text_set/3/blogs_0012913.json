Seriously. \nRelated: Trump's Lawyer Says Snoop Dogg 'Owes The President An Apology' \nIn a statement , Packer said: \n\"We are excited to bring one of the most distinctive and powerful media brands to AMI and are looking forward to continuing its great editorial standards its loyal and growing audience expects.\" \nIf you are a loyal Us reader, we wouldn't exactly count on those standards continuing. The entire 45-person staff apparently have to re-interview for their own jobs right away. Eesh. \nAMI also owns the Enquirer , Radar Online , Star , OK! Magazine , and Soap Opera Digest . This will be their largest celebrity news magazine to date. \nCountdown to a \"Just Like Us\" feature about golden toilets… \nR.I.P.
