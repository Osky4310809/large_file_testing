Gaedeke \n\"The city of Plano has been very supportive, and One Legacy West is an excellent option in terms of quality and size for our needs.\" \nNTT Data is renting 126,715 square feet or more than 40 percent of the new One Legacy West office tower from developer Gaedeke Group. The 307,824 square-foot, 14-story high-rise opens at the end of this month. \nIt's located between Toyota's new North American headquarters and the world headquarters for FedEx Office. \n\"This is a huge win for Plano, Legacy West and our project,\" Belinda Dabliz, vice president of leasing for Dallas-based Gaedeke. \"It's a perfect marriage - a 21 st century building and a prominent, innovative IT company.\" \nBoth the City of Plano and the State of Texas provided financial incentives to land the NTT Data operation. \nLast year NTT Data paid Dell more than $3 billion to acquire the former Perot Systems data services operation, which is based on Bush Turnpike at Custer Road. \nNTT Data already had a large office at the southeast corner of the Dallas North Tollway and State Highway 121 before the Dell purchase. \nJapan-based NTT DATA is one of the top global business and technology services providers with more than 100,000 employees in about 50 countries. The company is a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, one of the world's largest telecom firms. \nThe new Legacy West will initially house 600 workers that will be consolidated from its existing Plano offices and from across the country, along with hires. \nSteve Jarvie and Damian Rivera of E Smith Realty Partners negotiated the new office lease with Dabliz and Gaedeke. \nThe big office lease is one of the largest signed in North Texas and recent months and was one of the most competitive. Jarvie said the quality of the building and the ownership landed the deal. \n\"We live for days like this and we are thrilled that NTT DATA has chosen to expand its footprint in Plano,\" Plano Mayor Harry LaRosiliere said in a statement. \"We look forward to deepening the partnership with NTT DATA on all levels.\" \nFedEx Office has already opened its headquarters next door to NTT Data's new office. \nAnd Toyota will start moving into its sprawling campus across the street later this year. \nConstruction is underway nearby on the office campuses for Liberty Mutual Insurance and JPMorgan Chase. \nWithin two years almost 20,000 new jobs are expected to be located in the area around the intersection of the tollway and S.H. 121. \nSteve Jarvie with E Smith Realty, NTT Data CEO John McCain, Gaedeke's Belinda Dabliz, Plano Mayor Harry LaRosiliere, Emmitt Smith of E Smith Realty, Glenn Lickstein of Gaedeke and David Croxville CFO of NTT Data at the One Legacy West tower.
