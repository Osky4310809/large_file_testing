And this war is, I think, metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it.\"\nWhile the message is quite different than the one of inclusion and acceptance communicated by the Pope, it allegedly has a number of supporters within the Catholic Church. \nAs the New York Times points out, \"And in Mr. Trump, and more directly in Mr. Bannon, some self-described 'Rad Trads' — or radical traditionalists — see an alternate leader who will stand up for traditional Christian values and against Muslim interlopers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:35:30.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
