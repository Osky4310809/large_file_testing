Weeks earlier, word spread that LeBron James and the Cavs took some shots at their new bitter rivals at the King’s Halloween party . \nIn addition to their zany costumes, the Cavs openly mocked the whole 3-1 lead thing with this setup:\n\nAnd they also served tombstone cookies that featured the names of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson:\nLeBron James went full savage at his Halloween party. pic.twitter.com/9NZFHxchD3 \n— Alex Kennedy (@AlexKennedyNBA) October 31, 2016 \n\n\nThat’s just the stuff that was featured on social media right after the party. When he was asked about the 3-1 joke and cookies the day after Halloween, Thompson said he didn’t care, but ESPN’s Chris Haynes wrote that the star was “visibly irritated by the subject.” When Christmas day rolled around, the Halloween fun got some new life, as ESPN reported this additional nugget that was interestingly left out of the Instagram photo round-up:\nBack in October, at James’ Halloween party that made headlines for its mock tombstones that memorialized the Warriors’ lost 3-1 Finals lead, sources told ESPN.com there was even a dummy dressed up like Curry on the floor of the haunted house that guests had no choice but to walk over when they arrived to get to the party.\nSomehow that never came up on the court, but Thompson hasn’t forgotten it. It was hard enough for the Warriors to blow a 14-point lead in that game, but knowing how much fun the Cavs are having at his expense, Thompson is definitely trying to channel his anger.\n\n“It’s obviously not respectful, so it’s got to be on the other side of the spectrum, so that’s fine with us. They can do that childish stuff. It doesn’t matter to us. All we’ve got to do is handle it on the court, you know?\n“No, it didn’t (come up on the court in the Christmas Day game). But shoot, it might have (to). I mean, I still think we need to play with more of an edge next time we see them … I mean when we won the championship, though, we didn’t do some stuff like that. But that’s OK. People are built differently. We’re not going to – I’m not going to hold it against them. I’m just going to go out there, and we just want to beat them down next time we see them. That’s how it is. Hold that in the memory bank, and just remember that they do that stuff…It’s a good rivalry, and it’s good for the NBA. It makes it more fun, you know? It’s rare in pro sports you get rivalries like this, so we enjoy it, and we embrace it.” (Via USA Today )\n“But shoot, it might have to?” Gee shucks, Mr. LeBron, sure do wish you’d stop making fun of me. Will someone get Charles Oakley into the Warriors’ locker room to teach these guys how to handle their enemies? Well, except for Draymond Green. He already knows how to handle business, or at least kicking people in theirs.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T18:14:37.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
