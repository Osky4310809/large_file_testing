I know these people are likely to be using social media and therefore I ask you to continue sharing the appeal so it reaches those who need to see it. \n“I also have a message for Patrick. We have been working for more than a week now to find you and make sure you are safe. A considerable number of police officers have been dedicated to looking for you. Please get in touch with us and let us know you are ok.” \nThere are concerns for Patrick who is missing from the Frinton area of Essex. \nHe is described as being 5ft 2ins and of a slim build.
