He made us believe\" says Garcia of Gerrard in Istanbul (Photo: null) \nAnd because he made the journey from young hopeful to club legend, he is ideally placed to reach the same heights as a manager. \n“Stevie was a great leader as a player, on and off the pitch, and he can take that into coaching and management,” said Garcia, who was unveiled as the latest recruit for Star Sixes, a new six-a-side tournament for former internationals being held this summer — where he will face Gerrard.

He made us believe,” said Garcia. \nNow, the Spaniard believes Gerrard has made the right move to start his coaching career with the next generation.

It is better that he learns what it is all about at academy level first.” Gerrard following the action in a Liverpool U18s game earlier this month (Photo: PA) \nAnd in the week that marked the passing of Ronnie Moran , who went from Liverpool captain to coach some of the club’s greatest sides, Garcia said Gerrard will be following a great tradition. \nBob Paisley and Kenny Dalglish both progressed from playing for the club to managing the Reds, and Garcia believes Gerrard can do the same. \nHe said: “It’s been a sad week for Liverpool with Ronnie’s passing.
