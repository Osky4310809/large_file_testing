He harasses his opponents and gives the ball to his offensive players.\" \nArsenal are locked in the grip of what seems like a perennial crisis, having exited the Champions League with a humbling 10-2 aggregate defeat to Bayern Munich and dropping out of the title race domestically. \nFive things we didn't learn from England \nArsene Wenger is reportedly weighing up the offer of a new two-year contract amid increasing discontent among certain supporters, but Koscielny claimed the Gunners players deserve to shoulder the weight of blame for another slump, rather than the manager. \n\"He is a very important one in my career, he shaped me as a player and as a man,\" the defender said. \n\"We are in a complicated situation but it is not only his responsibility. These are the players on the field. He prepares us all week but we have to do more to have the desired results.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:13:04.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
