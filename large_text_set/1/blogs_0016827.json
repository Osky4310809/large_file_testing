Yes I see it that way as Chelsea is ahead and everyone else is fighting. \n“So it is important first of all to try to make a distance with the teams around you, take advantage of points they could drop and try to get closer to Chelsea. You never know.” \nChelsea begin this weekend seven points clear of Spurs and Liverpool with Arsenal a point behind.

We had good domination but they defended very well. \n“You could see when I came out of the game that they will not go down as they had the spirit and organisation. They have strong points. \n“They accept to leave you the ball. Not many teams do that and keep their focus. They say, ‘Ok from the start of the game you have the ball but we might try to kill you at some stage’. \n“You need a special spirit to do that. Once you are ten years in the premier league the pressure is on you to do more.
