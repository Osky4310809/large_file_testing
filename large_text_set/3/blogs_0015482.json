The clip contains laugh-y, smiley tap dancing and the lyrics “I’m your super friend” and “that’s the power of friendship.”\nLike, at this point is the CW just openly firing shots at the DC film universe? These two shows are so joyful and warm that they almost feel like an over-the-top parody of their cinematic counterparts. But then someone will interview Gustin and he’ll say something like, “It’s all about love, really, and musical theater,” or Benoist will post Instagram photos with puppies and Girl Scouts , and I’ll realize…they’re just having this much fun, folks.\nBelow you can delight in the full lyrics:\nAt times like these\nWhen life is getting me down\nAnd the world seems like it’s gonna end…ship\nThere’s at least one power\nThat we both still have\nAnd that’s the power of…friendship!\nI’m your super friend\nYour super friend\nI’ll be there in the nick of time\nIf you’re ever in a spot!\nAnd if you’re not there in time\nYou can go back in time\nand give it another shot!\nNow I’ll just sit back and wait for the internet to snarkily dub this song over Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice footage.\n(Via io9 ; image via screengrab)\nWant more stories like this?
