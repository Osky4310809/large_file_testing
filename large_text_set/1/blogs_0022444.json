Could   \nThe family of drug dealer who was part of a £180 MILLION money laundering plot faces losing FOUR homes because of his criminal deeds. \nRelatives of Alam Zeb Khan were told in the High Court they must give up a portfolio of properties in Birmingham and Northern Ireland that are thought to have been funded by his criminal activities . \nKhan, of Birmingham, previously served sentences starting in 2000 for heroin smuggling, in 2012 for a cocaine supply plot and in 2013 for money laundering. \nHowever, following his latest conviction, the National Crime Agency (NCA) went after his family’s assets. \nAccording to the Birmingham Mail , Alam Zeb Khan was part of a A gang of 32 men who laundered more than £180 million for drug traffickers which was jailed for a total of 140 years in 2014. \nThe huge money laundering scam saw a staggering £44 million deposited into a single bank in Small Heath. Alam Zeb Khan may have cost his family four homes (Photo: Birmingham Mail) \nThe racket was smashed by National Crime Agency officers, who filmed bags of cash being exchanged in Birmingham. \nCriminally tainted money was said to have been used to build a substantial portfolio in the names of Alam Zeb Khan’s wife and Northern Ireland-based brother and sister-in-law. \nAnd now, after a hearing at the High Court, a top judge has handed over the keys to four houses to the agency, which tackles serious organised crime in the UK.
