AP:Associated Press 6 Nick Viergever was in the right place at the right time to open the scoring \nThe game needed a moment of magic and after some scintillating passing, the ball found Davy Klaassen in the box who laid it into the path of Hakim Ziyech. \nHis first time effort was beaten away by the keeper but right into the path of Viergever to poke home three minutes into the second-half. Getty Images 6 Ajax celebrate after finally breaking the deadlock three minutes into the second half \nFollowing a 0-0 draw in the first-leg, Ajax dominated the early possession but had to wait until the 19th minute to create their first clear-cut opportunity. \nAnd they were so unlucky not to break the deadlock. \nFollowing some good work down the left flank by Amin Younes, the forward squared the ball to the talented Ziyech whose effort hit off the post with the keeper beaten. \nKasper Dolberg should have pounced on the rebound but was caught on his heels.
