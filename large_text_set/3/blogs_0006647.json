Image copyright Paul Merchant/ My Marlow/ Google Image caption Bridges in Marlow, Buckinghamshire (left) and Swarkestone, Derbyshire have both been affected by HGVs \nRAC Foundation director, Steve Gooding, said: \"In the face of growing traffic volumes and ageing infrastructure the danger is that without an adequate long-term funding settlement we will see more rather than fewer bridges with weight restrictions, with the backlog bill getting bigger all the time.\" \nIn September, a Grade 1 listed bridge in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was closed for months after it was driven over by a lorry more than 10 times heavier than its weight limit. \nLast July a driver was fined after he ignored eight warning signs before driving a lorry more than six times the weight limit over Swarkestone Bridge, Derbyshire, which is an ancient monument. \nAlmost half (47%) of bridges managed by Slough Borough Council are inadequate, more than anywhere else in England, followed by Bristol (37%). \nThe cost of clearing the backlog of work on all bridges is estimated to be Â£3.9bn. \nThe survey was carried out in partnership with the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:19:26.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
