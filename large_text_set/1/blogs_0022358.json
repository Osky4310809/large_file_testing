Each Party Safe bag has an Uber code that’s good for $10 off your ride home that night and, because you might struggle to remember how your hands work, its integrated near-field communication (NFC) technology, which means if you can just manage to touch the bag with your phone, it will call that Uber for you.

And a lot of times all you need to stop short of driving after drinking is a friend who calls you off. On Sunday of the big game, we want Tostitos to be that friend.” \nBaran is probably right to suggest that we could all use a friend that night, regardless of whether we’re pulling for the Falcons, the Patriots, or we’re just watching to see all the embarrassing prescription drug commercials. According to a 2003 study by researchers at the University of Toronto, there is a 41 percent increase in motor vehicle accidents in the hours after the Super Bowl, including a jaw-dropping 70 percent increase in accidents in the first hour immediately after the final whistle. \nAlso, according to post-game research from BACTrack , the maker of smartphone Breathalyzers, its users averaged an above-the-limit 0.84 blood alcohol content during the fourth quarter of last year’s Super Bowl. \nThose University of Toronto scientists suggested that the Super Bowl’s sponsors “subsidize public transit after the telecast” in an effort to keep drivers safer. Ten-plus years later, a Tostitos bag that helps you get your ass in an Uber is probably a step in the right direction too. \nBut, as a rule of thumb, if you have to ask an empty bag of tortilla chips if you’re too drunk to drive, then you’re definitely too drunk to drive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T20:23:33.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
