We are thirsty for the title and we're going for it.\" \nNevertheless, Neymar is in no doubt about the scale of the task ahead of Barca, as he acknowledges LaLiga as the strongest league in Europe. \n\"I think it's currently the best league, the Spanish league,\" he continued. \"[Spanish clubs] have been winning virtually all the international titles in the last three years ... [with the Champions League] interchanging between Barcelona and [Real] Madrid. \n\"Also, Sevilla won the UEFA [Europa League], so I think Spain is pretty much ruling lately. There are other clubs and other players that are excellent - real stars in other leagues - but I think Spain is excelling the most.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:12:23.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
