The latest is the vehicle you see above: the Velar. Reported to share its platform with the Jaguar F-Pace , the Velar slots between the 172-inch-long Evoque and the 191-inch-long Sport in the Range Rover lineup. Using a mix of four- and six-cylinder engines, the Velar would go up against the Porsche Macan and BMW X3, leaving the Evoque to battle against smaller competitors such as the BMW X1 and the Audi Q3. \n-Although the new Range Rover SUV may be the first production Land Rover to bear the Velar moniker, the British brand is keen to note that the name goes back nearly half a century. Derived from the Latin velare , which means “to veil or cover,” it was originally used in 1969 by Land Rover development engineers attempting to hide the real identity of the 26 pre-production Range Rovers they were working on.\n- \n-While Land Rover’s single teaser image keeps most of the Velar’s details covered ( velar ed?), the picture does reveal a number of interesting model-specific features. For instance, the doors appear to sport flush-mounted exterior handles, while the rear end includes a full-width wraparound taillight design, a feature not found on any other Land Rover or Range Rover model sold today. Additionally, the Velar’s glass roof panel reveals a large dash-mounted touchscreen that we expect would use the latest iteration of the brand’s InControl Touch Pro infotainment system.\n- - Long-Term Test: A Year with a Diesel Range Rover - Range Rover Sport vs. Audi Q7, BMW X5, Volvo XC90 - Range Rover Research: Full Pricing, Specs, Photos, and More - -While we like what we see of the Velar in this single teaser image, we’ll reserve our judgment until we can see the new Range Rover from ground level. Land Rover will reveal more about its newest SUV on March 1.\n- \n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:42:54.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
