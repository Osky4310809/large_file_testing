MONTEGRANDE \nChina and the Philippines will hold direct talks on their maritime dispute in May, Filipino officials said on Wednesday, as President Duterte seeks stronger economic ties with Beijing. \nLast year, a United Nations-backed international tribunal rejected Beijing’s claims to most of the South China Sea, including disputed areas close to the coasts of its neighbors. \nBut Mr. Duterte, who was elected last year, has played down that ruling and pushed for rapprochement with China as he seeks billions of dollars in trade and investment from it. ADVERTISEMENT \nChina this week offered to host a meeting in May of a “bilateral consultation mechanism” to tackle issues related to the sea row, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said. \n“This is a new proposal, a bilateral consultation mechanism specifically on the South China Sea,” DFA spokesperson Charles Jose told reporters. \nChina rejects the tribunal’s ruling and asserts sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea, despite partial counter-claims from Brunei, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. \nIt has extensively reclaimed reefs and installed military and other facilities, including airstrips, on some outcrops. \nChina has always favored bilateral talks with each rival claimant instead of negotiations involving all six, as was previously favored by the Philippines. \nAnalysts say direct talks with smaller neighbors would allow China to exert its massive economic and political leverage in a region dependent on Chinese trade. \nJose said the Chinese invitation for the May bilateral talks set no preconditions. \n“What is important is we have a peaceful means [to resolve the dispute],” he said. \n“On the part of the Philippines, we are fully committed to our position of peaceful settlement of disputes, one in accordance with the rule of law,” he added. \nMr. Duterte, 72, has repeatedly said he did not want to go to war with Beijing over the sea row. \nAfter his election, he pivoted the country’s foreign policy away from traditional ally the United States toward China. \nJose said the direct talks would be the “platform” where the Philippines could raise issues like China’s construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea. — REPORTS FROM AFP AND JEANNETTE I.
