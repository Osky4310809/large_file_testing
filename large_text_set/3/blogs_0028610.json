It is dramatically raising the level of efficiency,” she said. \nThe car integrates with blockchain technologies to record and update contracts to simplify the processes of secure payments and smart contracts, she noted. \nBlockchain is a method of recording data, a digital ledger of transactions, agreements, contracts - anything that needs to be independently recorded and verified as having happened, and is seen as potentially disrupting the conventional ways of doing businesses. \nRichey said Visa is working with over 50 partners, from big-names like IBM Corp to IT startups to explore blockchain technologies. \nChinese bankcard network China UnionPay is also using blockchain technologies for trial projects on cross-border transactions and supplying chain finance. \nPresident Shi Wenzhao said the technology is still at an infancy stage, when a decentralized approach of blockchain may fail to sustain high-frequency transactions. \n“Major technological breakthroughs could only be achieved when big institutions step in,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T07:23:39.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
