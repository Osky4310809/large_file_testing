ET's Denny Directo caught up with the La La Land star at the 32nd Santa Barbara International Film Festival on Friday, where he revealed whether his longtime love, Eva Mendes, would be joining him at the Oscars. WATCH: Ryan Gosling Thanks 'Sweetheart' Eva Mendes and Honors Her Late Brother in Emotional Golden Globes Speech \"Oh, I'm not sure,\" said Gosling, who is nominated for Best Actor for his role in the modern musical. \"It's still a little while away.\" Whether or not Mendes makes it to the event, Gosling is sure to have a good time. The 37-year-old actor revealed that after a long awards season, he's still not tired of co-star Emma Stone or director Damien Chazelle. \"The temptation is to say something sarcastic, but the truth is we feel so lucky to have made the film, and that was reward enough,\" Gosling shared. \"The fact that people are receiving it the way they are is so unexpected. All of it has been a really nice surprise.\" ET also spoke with Stone and Chazelle, who also marveled at the musical's success. WATCH: Emma Stone Reveals the One Thing Fans Don't Know About Ryan Gosling \"What a trip,\" Stone said, while Chazelle said he's already been asked to adapt the musical for Broadway. \"I haven't given it much thought, but certainly maybe one day in the future. Never say never.\" And while Gosling could easily reprise his role on stage, he said getting his dance moves up to speed was harder than it looked. \"[My dance skills] were rough! They were rusty,\" he joked. \"I had danced as a kid but that was a long time ago and 90s hip hop is a little different then tap and you know the shim shamâ€¦waltzing.\" Something else that could have used a little more work was the wax figure unveiled of Gosling at the Madame Tussauds in Berlin, Germany.
