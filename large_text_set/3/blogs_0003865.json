Yeah, well, Lenovo (and Motorola) has decided that that was probably a mistake and is now willing to re-embrace Motorola as a brand. \nAccording to a story by CNET , Motorola chairman and president Aymar de Lencquesaing said during a conversation that his company now has “clarity on how we present ourselves.” That means we should get the Motorola batwing back in action, a heavy push of the Moto Z brand with Moto Mods, and expanded distribution to carriers outside of Verizon. \nBeyond that, CNET is reporting that Lenovo will eventually bring Motorola phones to almost all regions they currently sell phones, though it could take a while. Obviously, the US and Brazil are big Motorola markets already, but they see other places, like in Russia and China where Lenovo is big, that could prove to be beneficial. \nDe Lencquesaing also mentioned some interesting bits about the Moto Z and how it has seen much more success as it has aged than most phones. As you probably imagined, most phones sell well right out of the gate and then fizzle as they get older. But according to de Lencquesaing, the Moto Z has picked up more sales, likely because of the big marketing spend they are going through to re-brand themselves, but also because of the Moto Mods that people have apparently fallen all over. That’s big news for Motorola, especially as we get ready for a new Moto Z this year, along with a whole bunch of new Moto Mods . \nOn a related note, he also talked about Motorola’s lack of a 3rd gen Moto 360 or new smartwatch. According to the Motorola exec, his company doesn’t simply want to be “in the business doing a product for the sake of doing a product,” and that he sees too few practical uses in smartwatches for them to build another one. I can’t say I disagree there, especially knowing that the majority of our readers were fans of the Moto 360, yet he all-but-admitted theirs never sold well. \nTo recap, Motorola is back and that whole “Moto by Lenovo” stuff is likely on the way out. If I’m understanding de Lencquesaing correctly, we should all prepare for a big Motorola push back onto your favorite carriers this year. That’s an exciting thought for fans of this iconic brand.

Same exact body with updated internals/display and Nougat. Michael Bassett \nMy company went with Moto since the first android phone. They were tough and had good call quality and many other things. They are moving towards gimmicks with the “mods”, no company is going to buy a phone for 100+ employees that has mods. I would go back to a high IP rating, solid build quality, unsurpassed call, bluetooth, wifi connection quality and a awesome camera (possibly encryption, security too) . Stick with the basics. Darren Pawlak \nI know it’s a pipe dream, and likely impracticability if not impossibility, but some of these interviews from WMC has given the eternal optimist side of me a cautiously optimistic hope that maybe they really do understand something of what made Motorola, Motorola and really will try to distinguish Moto the way they finally made a road into the Android game again after Google bought them. That being, make the Motorola difference be that their phones are all about adding useful and complimentary enhancements to the already existing platform (i.e. what they did with Actions, Active Display, Twist/Shake/Chop, “OK *wake-phrase-here*” from full screen off, etc…) rather than reinventing the wheel with Skins and other kludginess that just drives people crazy and makes it hard to update the OS. They want to be AI agnostic right? how cool would it be to really actually have Alexa, Cortana, etc… with hooks almost as deep as Google Now/Assistant into the phone so that you can choose whichever lady strikes your fancy and still have them work just as good or better than on their native ecosystems? Again, I know it’s a bit overly hopeful and possibly totally rainbows and unicorns land thinking here, but, well, would be kinda cool to go back to that again right? Arty McBert \nThank God! Please keep making great devices like the Moto X Pure and Moto Z Play. rebretz000 \nNow if they could just get back to making Motorola devices instead of those ugly Lenovo devices. paul_cus \nGood. Lenovo shouldn’t have messed with it to begin with. Jellybelly Bean \nI’ve owned Motorola phones for years now, (currently a Moto X Pure), & I don’t care what they name this company…I will NEVER buy another Motorola product !!!! Note: I do love my Moto X, but because they are so horrible with updates, I no longer trust this company!!! Raven \nAlthough most older devices seem to have been abandoned, I think they have done quite well with the Droid Turbo 2 and Moto Z lines. Jellybelly Bean \nCan’t comment on the Droid Turbo 2 or Z series, but the selling point on the Pure Edition was “unlocked” with all carriers, stock Android, & TIMELY updates! They have failed miserably with updates !!! santy83 \nKeep it simple – Motorola for phones and Lenovo for Tablets and PCs DJ SPY \nAt the end of the day, it’s still “by Lenovo”. They’re just trying to hide it. Mike Aurin \nSpeaking of, the Moto Z line got a mystery update today. Any idea what it included? Darren Pawlak \nprobably a security patch :/ Motonovo/Lenovorola/MOTObyNOVO has been impressively good at shoving out a quick security patch with (maybe) a tiny fix or two almost every month since the Zs came out (Gotta say, even I was skeptical and thusly impressed so far with the update quantity) JSo \nMake up your mind Lenovorola CoolSilver \nFile this under D for Duh Digirati Studios \nIt’ll be interesting to see what they come up with. I’m still doing fine with my Moto X Pure running Marshmallow. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7e3e4482b6589d925cbfc3bb6139c13b71cd4239c28f67b2898ce81543647c6.jpg Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nlove that phone! not the battery though. it was scary bad for me and I ended up getting my nexus 6p to replace it. Digirati Studios \nNever had battery issues, but very interested in the Pixel if it is ever in stock. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nI could rarely make it through a full day without having to plug in. I took it to Disney a few times and was dead by 3 in the afternoon two days. finally had to get a powerbank to help get thru the day. granted, I took a lot of pictures/videos of my kids. my old note 5 had the same issue. \nI have the V20 and Pixel XL right now, I can EASILY make it through a day of VERY heavy use. Jellybelly Bean \nI like my Moto X too, but not getting updated security patches, & STILL waiting for 7.0 has soured me on this company! Digirati Studios \nI’m assuming most any phone isn’t really getting more than one major version in a two year life (aside from the all the Nexus). Wish it wasn’t so, but I’ll still gladly take the pure experience over anything else. h4rr4r \nTo me that means there are no phones to buy other than Nexus/Pixel. Julian Coronado \nStill using my Moto X (2014) but since Verizon stopped updates long ago I’ve been running CM/Lineage ROMs and I love it even more! cvm \nLenovo is bipolar. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nIf anything, the name Lenovo should be phased out and their thought process should be phased out. morteum \nThat would be so weird. Lenovo just becomes Motorola after firing 95% of their employees. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \ni dont care. I was liking what Moto was doing pre-Lenovo. Now? yikes. Bryan Kolb \nDunno. I loved the original Moto X, but the 2nd gen was a big flop for me, enough so that I went with a Nexus when my 2nd gen Moto X broke. At that point Moto wasn’t really innovating anymore. I suppose the Moto Mods are an innovation, of a sort, but the core functionality of the phone is more important to me at this point. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \ni like the moto mods. I think its the way modules should be implemented. but this is where “thought process” elimination should happen. Lenovo wants top dollar for anything and everything. meanwhile….sales suck. hkklife \nI didn’t like the OG Moto X or its successor. I loved, however, the Moto X Pure in THEORY (big screen, affordable, 64GB Variant, all-carrier compatibility, minimal bloat) but it was ruined by Lenovo’s horrendous support policies. I haven’t been fond of any of the Moto Mods or the Z line but releasing a true flagship (GS6-level specs, return of the headphone jack, 6″ screen, big stock battery) would immediately bring me back into the fold but ONLY if Lenovo improves their support. Michael J Wood \nThey should have a recall , because of the USB charger port troubles everyone is having, but they won’t. And to make it worse they won’t even admit that there is a problem!!! moew \nPrelenovo – rebrand? More like UNBRANDING – INVENTED Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ \nblahaha love it, I think meow got it! moew \nmoew!
