A tiny proportion of their DNA would come from their mother, father, and a third person – a female egg donor – to replace abnormal genes in the mitochondria. Read more 3-parent babies can now legally be born in Britain \nCritics of the treatment say it is a dangerous step that will lead to the creation of genetically modified “designer babies.” \nMitochondria only hold around 0.1 percent of a person’s DNA, which is always inherited through the mother. Abnormal mitochondrial DNA can lead to potentially fatal conditions affecting vital organs, muscles, vision, growth, and mental ability. Such defects are said to affect one in 4,000 people. \nThe medical team in Newcastle says they are delighted with the decision “to help families affected by these devastating diseases,” calling it a “momentous day” for patients, according to the BBC. \nThe clinic says they already have women lined up for the therapy and hope to treat up to 25 women a year with NHS funding. \nOn Thursday, the Human Fertilization and Embryo Authority (HFEA) confirmed that Newcastle had been given a license to carry out the first procedure, which means at least one woman is already lined up to undergo the groundbreaking treatment. \nThat means the first three-parent baby could be born around Christmas 2017. \nThe approval of the license has been welcomed by members of the British science community. Professor Simon Fishel, managing director of CARE Fertility, tweeted it was “fantastic news.” Fantastic news for those parents who need alternative reproductive options - https://t.co/9aM2jDPyKi .

The UK, however, will not be the first country in the world to have children born through the three-person technique. \nA Jordanian couple and a group of American doctors performed the procedure in Mexico, and the resulting baby is understood to be healthy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:24:24.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
