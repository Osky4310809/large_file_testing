It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.) â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 \nPrime time! It's Must See SCOTUS! Above is our best guess as to who Trump will select: Sheldon Cooper, the character played by actor Jim Parsons on TV's highest-rated sitcom , The Big Bang Theory . \nPros: Will maximize attention, which is apparently POTUS' goal here. Cons: Probably believes in global warming and evolution given the whole science thing. \nBen Mathis-Lilley edits the Slatest. Follow @Slatest on Twitter .
