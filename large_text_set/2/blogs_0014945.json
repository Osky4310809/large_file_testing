John Rieger-USA TODAY Sports Feb 17, 2017 at 4:56p ET 0Shares \nSURPRISE, Ariz. — Christian Colon spent the offseason training with Kansas City Royal teammate Alex Gordon, who is known for his maniacal workouts. \nColon said he lost 8 percent of his body fat, turning that into muscle. \n“He’s on another level,” Colon said Friday before the team’s first full-squad workout. “It was intense.” \nSo is the Royals’ competition for the second base job, the only position up for grabs in spring training. Manager Ned Yost listed four candidates for the job: Whit Merrifield, Cheslor Cuthbert, Raul Mondesi and Colon. \n“It’s about time,” Yost said with a laugh after he was asked about Colon joining Gordon for the workouts. \nIt could be Colon’s time, at age 27, to claim a starting job. Colon was the fourth player picked in the 2010 draft and has some memorable postseason hits, but in parts of three major league seasons he has played in 118 games and started in just 78. He hit .231 last season in 54 games. \nHe wants the everyday job. \n“Correct,” Colon said. “I definitely want to compete for that job and give it all I’ve got.” \nSo does Merrifield. \n“It’s one I would like to win,” Merrifield said. “I put myself in a good position physically and mentally this offseason to compete and hopefully win the job. We have some good players. Whoever wins the job is going to earn it.” \nMerrifield started 55 games at second base last year, but he also played first, third, right field and left field. He hit .283 as a rookie. \nMerrifield is no slouch in winter workouts, dead lifting a personal best 540 pounds. \n“I’m stronger than people give me credit,” he said. “In the offseason, I like to lift heavy weights.” \nCuthbert is the most intriguing of the four. He hit .274 with 12 home runs and 48 RBIs in 128 games. After Mike Moustakas needed season-ending knee surgery, Cuthbert became the everyday third baseman. Moustakas is healthy in spring training and the Royals are experimenting with moving Cuthbert to second base.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:32:58.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
