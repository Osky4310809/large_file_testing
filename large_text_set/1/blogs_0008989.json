We now know the answer, courtesy of Buzzfeed which fill published the full document \"so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government.\" \nThere are just a few problems with this revolutionary Rosetta stone that should, at least superficially, discredit the Trump presidency as a puppet of the Kremlin. As eve BuzzFeed observes, \" the document is not just unconfirmed: It includes some clear errors. The report misspells the name of one company, “Alpha Group,” throughout. It is Alfa Group. The report says the settlement of Barvikha, outside Moscow, is “reserved for the residences of the top leadership and their close associates.” It is not reserved for anyone, and is also populated by the very wealthy.\" \nEven more amusing is that the documents have circulated for months, and were available to the Clinton campaign should she have chosen to use them to discredit Trump yet for some \"odd reason\" she did not, and furthermore \"acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials who have seen them.\" \nMother Jones writer David Corn referred to the documents in a late October column. Harry Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson tweeted Tuesday that the outgoing Senate Democratic leader had seen the documents before writing a public letter to FBI director James Comey about Trump’s ties to Russia. And CNN reported Tuesday that Arizona Republican John McCain a gave “full copy” of the memos to FBI Director James Comey on December 9, but that the FBI already had copies of many of the memos. \nSo with all this information floating around \"for months\", and duly noted by everyone in US government, from intelligence to the FBI, and certainly peopple in the unsuccessful Clinton campaign, it only emerges now, ten days before the Trump inauguration? \nCoincidence? Readers can decide on their own. \nFor those pressed for time, here is the best - as in most laughable - part, discussing \"Trump's personal obsessions and sexual perversions\", in which we learn that when staying at the Ritz Carlton Moscow hotel, in order to defile a bed in which Obama had stayed in previously, he employed \"a number of prostitutes to perform \"golden showers\" show in front of him.\" Good stuff. \nThe full memo, courtesy of BuzzFeed, is below ( link ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:14:52.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
