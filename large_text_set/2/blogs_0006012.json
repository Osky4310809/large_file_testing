Roberts beat Richard Petty by 27 seconds in his No. 22 Pontiac, as both were the only drivers to finish on the lead lap.

Marlin was penalized and saw his hopes of winning dashed. \nThe costly mistake allowed Burton to shock the world and race his way to a surprise victory in the No. 22 Bill Davis Racing Dodge.

His victory in the No. 22 Team Penske Ford was also the second for team owner Roger Penske. ©, Michael L. Levitt ©2015, Michael L.
