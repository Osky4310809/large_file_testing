The Wisconsin Republican trumpeted the bill despite a broad and bipartisan selection of critics, which included elected officials, journalists and interest groups. \nNow, an account in the Washington Post shows the desperate measures Speaker Ryan went to in his ultimately doomed effort to round up Republican votes. In at least one instance, he literally begged on one knee. \nPer the Post : \nRyan got down on a knee to plead with Rep. Don Young, an 83-year-old from Alaska who is the longest-serving Republican in Congress and remains undecided. \nThe begging, however, was a bust, and Young ultimately called Ryan’s cancelation of the vote a “victory for Alaska. ” \nThe effort to pass the American Health Care Act swiftly collapsed last week after scheduled votes for the bill on Thursday and Friday were canceled. Both Trump and Ryan pulled out all the stops before the final loss. At various points, the president threatened GOP lawmakers who defied him and warned that if the bill failed, he would move on to other priorities. \nThe White House and Congress have now signaled their intention to tackle tax reform. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:16:44.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
