The movie stars the original Golmaal star Ajay Devgn along with Parineeti Chopra, who has been roped in to play the leading lady. Now as per a popular daily, Tabu is all set to join the cast of this out-and-out comedy film. Tabu confirmed the news, stating, \"I wasn't shocked or surprised when I was offered the film. I have always loved the Golmaal series and was quite excited about being a part of it. Ajay is a friend and I also know the remaining cast, and working with friends is always wonderful.\" When she was asked if she is too serious for a comedy, the talented actor said, \"Nobody can laugh all the time. People close to me know my funny side. Also, comedy is one of my favourite genres.\" She further added, \"I remember watching Om Shanti Om at a theatre in Hyderabad. My sister was watching the same show with her friends and she didn't know that I was there.In the middle of the film, she called to ask if I was in the theatre, too. When I asked her how she found out, she said that she could hear my laughter. I love to be around people, who have a good sense of humour. All my friends are funny.\" Tabu's last comedy film was Hera Pheri (2000). When asked if her more serious roles was the reason she hasn't done comedy in a long time, she concluded by saying, \"I really don't have any preferences, biases or prejudices against any kind of cinema. I take up whatever is interesting. People will always approach you with what they think you are good at.I am glad that there are certain kind of roles people identify me with. At the same time, it's great that somebody like Rohit thought of casting me in a film like Golmaal .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T11:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T09:49:18.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
