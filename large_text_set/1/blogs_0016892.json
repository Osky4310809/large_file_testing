WhatsApp users can also exchange text messages. Pros \nSecure communications: All messages -- include voice, images, and files -- between WhatsApp users are protected with end-to-end encryption, using the same encryption protocol employed by Signal . \nVideo calls: You can make person-to-person video calls with WhatsApp either from the Calls screen or during a chat. However, WhatsApp cannot handle group video calls. \nIndividual and group chats: You can of course chat one-on-one with a contact. But you can also set up and administer group chats that can hold as many as 256 members. Send emojis, share documents, create recorded voice messages, snap and customize a photo, and send your location via chat. \nFree to chat: WhatsApp is entirely free to use, having dropped its annual subscription fee in 2016. The app doesn't run third-party ads either. \nBack up to Google Drive: You can back up your WhatsApp chat history, voice messages, photos, and videos to Google Drive. Backed-up data counts toward your Drive storage limit. Cons \nClosed system: As with many messaging apps, WhatsApp doesn't work with other messaging apps. To communicate with a contact, both parties need WhatsApp. Bottom Line \nThe free and popular WhatsApp messaging app does a good job of covering the bases, from text messaging to video chats. While many services offer a similar collection of communication tools, you have little reason to look elsewhere if your contacts rely on WhatsApp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:48:16.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
