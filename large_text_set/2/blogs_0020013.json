Ashley Young has been used sparingly by United this season. \nYoung is keeping his options open as he wants to be playing regularly and has been used sparingly by Jose Mourinho so far this season. \nThe former Aston Villa and Watford player has made just seven starts in all competitions for United and been played out of position at right-back. \nYoung, in the final 18 months of his contract, is happy at Old Trafford as long he remains part of the manager's first-team plans. \nThe club would be reluctant to lose him as they battle for silverware on four fronts. \nPeter O'Rourke is ESPN FC's transfer news correspondent.
