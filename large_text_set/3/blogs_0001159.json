Their mom, Candice Ann Wilkins, posted a photo of the girls yesterday in Pantsuit Nation , a Facebook group for supporters of Hillary Clinton, and these tiny justices are getting their due.\nWilkins lives with her daughters in Indiana, where she has been a single mom to the twins since their dad died in an accident when they were infants. She is a government teacher and obviously a strong role model for her daughters. But she told us that Ruby, who went as Ginsburg, and Cora, who was O’Connor, didn’t fully understand their costumes at first.\nIt wasn't until she explained to them that “these women were strong and were heroes by changing the world with their brains, not with a cape and tights\" that they were sold. Not surprisingly, their costumes were a hit with their teachers. Though their exact identities may have been a little lost on their four-year old classmates.\nBut no matter. They’ve reminded us that heroes come in all sizes. After all, who wants to be lame old Ironman when you can be Notorious RBG?\nBONUS: MamaBreast is a realistic breast-feeding device that can help new parents everywhere", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/KD0pBIi5.m3u8", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155866271608047&set=a.10150370607183047.434073.772143046&type=3&theater", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/KD0pBIi5.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/pantsuitnation11.8/"], "published": "2017-03-01T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:55:05.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
