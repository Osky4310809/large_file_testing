Ezequiel Garay, turning his marker with a superb piece of skill before squaring to Messi, whose side-footed shot failed to beat Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves with 15 minutes played. \nThe Argentine star hooked a shot over the crossbar moments later following a trademark mazy dribble but Barca lacked urgency and were punished for their slow start in the 29th minute. \nAfter Munir missed a one-on-one with Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Daniel Parejo's corner was met by the head of Mangala, who did well to shake off the attentions of Ivan Rakitic and direct the ball into the corner of the net. \nBarca were level six minutes later when Neymar's quick thinking in taking a fast throw-in put Suarez in behind Garay and the Uruguayan picked his spot, side-footing the ball past Alves and in at the far post. \nMangala was given his marching orders for pulling Suarez's shirt in the penalty area, his second booking in the space of five minutes, and Messi drilled the ensuing spot-kick low into the centre of the net to give Barcelona a 2-1 lead. \nUndeterred by going a man down, Valencia went straight onto the attack, Jose Gaya bursting clear before squaring to Munir and the loanee was unchallenged as he calmly tucked inside the post to make it 2-2 at half-time. \nNeymar had a shot saved by the leg of Alves after six minutes of the second half, but Valencia's Brazilian goalkeeper was beaten at his near post one minute later when Messi burst into the box and scored with his weaker right foot. 53: Messi dances into the box and with his right foot beats Diego Alves at the near post #FCBValencia #FCBlive (3-2) pic.twitter.com/OQtuxCsvqP — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) March 19, 2017 \nMunir caught Barcelona flat-footed once again after 56 minutes but Gerard Pique raced back to make a last-ditch tackle and prevent him from shooting, while at the other end Suarez spurned the chance to make it 4-2, firing wide of an open net after Alves parried Messi's shot right into his path. \nNeymar hit the outside of the post with a wonderful, curling free-kick after 76 minutes and the Brazilian star, who was chasing his 100th goal for the club, had to settle for a return to fitness after he missed Barca's previous game against Deportivo La Coruna. \nWith the game petering out and the visitors showing signs of fatigue, the scene was set for former Valencia player Gomes to score his first Barcelona goal and he did just that, stroking the ball home after Neymar's run and cross to make the final score 4-2. \n\nKey Opta stats: \n- Lionel Messi has scored his 100th brace for Barcelona in all competitions. - Barcelona have won more penalties than any other La Liga side this season in competitions (13). - Messi is the only LaLiga player to reach 40 goals in each of the last eight seasons in all competitions (41). - Barcelona have won all of their 17 La Liga games with Samuel Umtiti on the pitch. - Luis Suarez has scored eight goals in his seven games against
