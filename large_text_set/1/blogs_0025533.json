Now, new fruit stickers from Freshmax in New Zealand have arrived to help produce amateurs determine an avocado's ripeness based on where its color falls on the spectrum.\nSEE ALSO: Trump is going to build that damn wall and all people can talk about is avocados\nMy Avocado Has a Color Chart on the Sticker, So You Know When It's Ripe. from mildlyinteresting\nA Redditor noticed the new sticker and uploaded a photo of it to the subreddit r/MildlyInteresting for all to marvel at just how many grown humans would gather to discuss a sticker on a piece of fruit.\nThe top of the sticker is a bright green and is labeled as \"not ripe.\" Below that there is a \"firm ripe\" section that's a little darker, and finally, the darkest part of the sticker is \"soft ripe.\"\nWhile this may seem like common sense to someone who consumes avocados on a daily basis, it's nice to have something to compare it to, especially if you're looking to buy some avocados that will last you a few days.\nBut Redditors were quick to point out that ripeness should only be determined by the firmness of the fruit, not the color. Avocado experts from all around the world chimed in to give their two cents on the issue.\n\"Since my hometown is literally the avocado capital of the world, I feel I have some authority here,\" said one Redditor. \"When holding an avocado, press slightly with your thumb. If you feel a bit of give then it's ready to eat. Too much give and it will taste rotten. Obviously if it's hard then it's not ready but there is a very fine line between ripe and rotten. Color is not a very accurate way to gauge ripeness.\"\nOne person who claimed to live on an avocado farm also had some gripes with the fruit sticker, claiming it will only work on some cultivars.\nComment from discussion My Avocado Has a Color Chart on the Sticker, So You Know When It's Ripe. .\n[h/t: Munchies ]\nBONUS: This simple device creates clean water for those who need it", "external_links": ["https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/these-color-changing-stickers-tell-you-when-your-avocado-is-at-perfect-ripeness", "http://www.freshmax.co.nz/", "http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Dw2VQaN5.m3u8", "https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js", "https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/5psgxx/my_avocado_has_a_color_chart_on_the_sticker_so/?ref=share&ref_source=embed", "https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/5psgxx/my_avocado_has_a_color_chart_on_the_sticker_so/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/5psgxx/my_avocado_has_a_color_chart_on_the_sticker_so/dctvlxv/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/5psgxx/my_avocado_has_a_color_chart_on_the_sticker_so/dcu2u60/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Dw2VQaN5.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-31T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:14:20.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
