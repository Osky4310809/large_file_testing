He failed. They always do and always will. But the cost of his pitiful and repugnant attack on western values were the lives of 4 innocent people including PC Keith Palmer, a 15-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police Service. \nPC Palmer was stabbed to death preventing the attacker from to entering The Palace of Westminster, paying the ultimate price in defence of one of Britain’s most hallowed institutions. 2 Source \nHis family released a statement saying that the 48-year-old was a “wonderful dad and husband, a loving son, brother and uncle”, and a chapel service was held in the House of Commons. \nOn Thursday, a minute’s silence was held at 09:33 GMT in the Palace of Westminster and at New Scotland Yard. 3 Source \nCharlton Athletic F.C, of whom PC Palmer was a season ticket holder, have put a scarf on his seat, where it will remain until their next home game on 4th April. \nOne of his former colleagues said of PC Palmer, “Keith was a genuinely nice person; nobody had a bad word to say about him. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that’s just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. \n“He had a great work ethic, he worked on our warrants’ car for years, getting up at 04:00 to serve warrants and arresting wanted offenders. He was always so positive, always staying late after everyone else and getting in early.” 4 Source \nThe response of the British public has been immense, with a JustGiving page looking to provide for PC Palmer’s family smashing through its £100,000 target in a record breaking 6 hours. It is currently closing in on almost £300,000 and if you can give, then the link is here . 5 \nOn a personal note, and as a Londoner and former Met officer myself, it is hard for me to put into words the gratitude and sadness I feel for a man who ran forward when others ran back, who stood tall against the forces of evil and gave everything in the name of safeguarding freedom from the wolves of tyranny. \nThank you, PC Palmer…I’ll make the tea.
