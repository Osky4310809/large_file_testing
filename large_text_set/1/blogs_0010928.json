Just before he re-entered the lander, however, he made the enigmatic remark \"Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.\" \nMany people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut. However, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs. Over the years many people questioned Armstrong as to what the \"Good luck, Mr. Gorsky\" statement meant, but Armstrong always just smiled. \nOn July 5, 1995 (in Tampa Bay, FL) while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26-year-old question to Armstrong. This time he finally responded. Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Neil Armstrong felt he could answer the question. \nWhen he was a kid, he was playing baseball with a friend in the backyard. His friend hit a fly ball which landed in the front of his neighbor's bedroom windows. His neighbors were Mr. & Mrs. Gorsky. \nAs he leaned down to pick up the ball, young Armstrong heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, \"Oral sex! You want oral sex?! You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!\" \nTrue story. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Classic Novels Everyone Should Read \nI absolutely recall hearing these comments on the radio, in 1995, as told by Armstrong following the press conference. Either what I heard was an audio hoax, he was just kidding, or it is the truth. \nAre you SURE it was a hoax? It may not be part of the official transcript, but it seems that he said it. Is there a source to find audio of that news conference? \nDear Reader: \nNot to quibble over the finer points, but I labeled \"Good Luck, Mr. Gorsky\" an urban legend , not a hoax (the latter being defined as a deliberate attempt to deceive the public, which I don't think this was). Granted, I did say the story is false , and there's still no good reason to suppose otherwise. \nIt's quite possible that what you heard on the radio was Neil Armstrong trying to explain the origin of the Gorsky story, which, as he has stated elsewhere, he first heard delivered as a joke delivered in 1994 by stand-up comedian Buddy Hackett. And that makes sense. If you think about it, the story screams \" Borscht Belt \" right down to the ethnic ring of the protagonist's surname, \"Mr. Gorsky\" (or \"Mr. Liebowitz,\" as a British newspaper columnist once dubbed the same character). \nIn any case, I think we ought to take this statement by Eric M. Jones, editor of NASA's Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal , as the official and final word on the Gorsky affair: During November 1995, a clever (and slightly risqué) story was widely circulated on the Internet concerning a statement Neil is supposed to have made during the Apollo 11 EVA. At the suggestion of several readers, let me state that Neil never said \"Good luck, Mr. Gorsky\" at any time during the mission. Indeed, on November 28, 1995, Neil wrote, \"I understand that the joke is a year old. I first heard it in California delivered by (comedian) Buddy Hackett.\" \nIf for some reason that still doesn't satisfy, audio recordings of the first moonwalk — which, by the way, match my own recollection of the event as broadcast on live television — verify that Armstrong's exact words were: \"That's one small step for (a) man; one giant leap for mankind.\" \nIn my opinion, that cinches it — unless, of course, you're one of those who believes the lunar landing itself was a hoax , in which case the point is moot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:45:55.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
