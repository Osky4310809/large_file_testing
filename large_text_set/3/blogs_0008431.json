(Photo: Getty Images) More People who commute by train are supposed to mind their own business, for the sake of civility and sanity. Last week, a woman on a train overstepped those boundaries and gave a letter to a stranger who appeared to be suffering from an eating disorder. Now that stranger wants to thank the woman for her words. “Hello, I’m really sorry if writing this letter is a step out of line,” reads the note, which was handed to a woman calling herself “Rose” on the train to Brighton, England, according to Metro UK . “If it is, please feel free to put it in the bin! The last thing I want to do is upset or offend you.” The words that followed were the opposite of offensive to Rose, who let the Recover Clinic (an eating disorder clinic) post the letter on Instagram to share its message and possibly find its author, who walked away quickly after delivering it. “Everyone goes through troubles in life, some more serious than others,” the letter goes on. “I can’t help but notice yours and I’m so sorry — it must be difficult to wear your troubles, to have them appear as something so physically apparent.” The writer apologizes for making assumptions about Rose’s suffering, but her words indicate she may have been through something similar that inspired her to share her support in this quick note jotted down on a train ride. She urges Rose not to listen to the negative voices in her head that want her “dead.” “It’s not easy — believe me I know,” she writes, promising that it will get better. “Please take care of yourself today. xxx You’re beautiful, even if you can’t see it.” According to the Instagram post from Recover Clinic, Rose wants to remain anonymous, but they add “It would be amazing if the wonderful woman who wrote it could know how much of an impact she had on ‘Rose.'” Eating Disorder Awareness Week was last week, but if Instagram users share #RosesLetter, her message may get to more than just two strangers on a train.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:51:34.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
