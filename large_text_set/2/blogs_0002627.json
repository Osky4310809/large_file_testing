However, he adopted a more upbeat tone than at the end of 2016, when he warned of a “challenging” 2017, with the weakness of the pound likely to increase the cost of imported parts, pushing up car prices. \nHe said January’s numbers were “buoyed by a great range of new models which are safer and cleaner than ever before”. \nHe added: “It’s encouraging to see alternatively fuelled vehicles benefiting from this positive growth, reaching a record market share. \n“After record growth in 2016, some cooling is anticipated over the coming months, but provided interest rates remain low and the economy stable, the market is in a good position to withstand its short-term challenges.” \nThe Ford Fiesta remains the UK’s most popular car, followed by the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:55:51.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
