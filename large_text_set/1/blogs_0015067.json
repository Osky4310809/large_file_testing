Some will argue that zombies could definitely happen, while others will state that there's just now way in hell. \nOthers will say zombies in certain properties are pretty realistic, while other franchises are entirely too far outside the realm of possibility. (Photo: AMC ) \nThe Walking Dead has now become the standard in zombie theology, as the show is easily the most recognizable entry in the genre. We all know that the infection has been spread through the air, and even death can't keep you from turning into the undead. \nHow realistic is this possibility? Is this what zombies could really be like? AMC is going to try and figure out the exact answers to these questions. \nIn a recent press release, the network has announced that they are going forward with a docu-series from legendary filmmaker James Cameron , and the show will aim to put science up next to popular science fiction. \nThe working title for the series is James Cameron's Story Of Science Fiction , and it is going to shine a light on the facts behind everyone's favorite franchises - including The Walking Dead. \nAccording to AMC, the new show will look at a lot of the popular franchises that exist within today's world. From Star Wars and Avatar to The Hunger Games and “The Walking Dead,” sci-fi has become a cornerstone of pop culture. In each episode of “James Cameron’s Story of Science Fiction,” Cameron introduces one of the “Big Questions” that humankind has contemplated throughout the ages, and reaches back into sci-fi’s past to better understand how our favorite films, TV shows, books, and video games were born, and where the genre - and our species - might be going in the future. Cameron and his contemporaries, who have helped to fuel sci-fi’s spectacular growth over the last several decades, debate the merits, meanings, and impacts of the films and novels that influenced them. If you want to dive into the science behind Rick and Michonne's world, now might be your chance.
