During her drive, she followed the GPS from the highway onto a dirt road, which became more and more crude.\nFROM COINAGE: 9 Healthy Kitchen Staples That Cost Less Than $1 Per Serving \n“The problem was, the road wasn’t there,” Vanhecke said, explaining that her car soon ran out of gas. When she tried to make a 911 call, the call was dropped.\n“And that was the first moment I felt true panic,” she recalls.\nOver the course of five days, Vanhecke made an SOS sign, a signal fire, spotted a truck and chased after it to no avail, and constantly called 911.\n“I felt very disconnected from just everything and everyone. I was like, ‘Is there even a search out?’ At that point, that question crossed my mind,” she said. “But apparently there was a miscommunication somewhere and no one was looking for me at all.”\nOn the fifth day, Vanhecke hiked 11 miles before getting through to a 911 operator. Although the call dropped, she was able to be rescued on March 17 by a helicopter rescue crew who spotted her car.\nA member of the Air Rescue team with the Arizona Department of Public Safety told ABC News that Vanhecke “did a lot of things that helped her survive.”\nVanhecke created a GoFundMe page to help raise funds for medical expenses, as well as any repairs needed for her car. So far, the donations have exceeded her $1,200 goal.\nThe college student said her bucket list helped her remain composed.\n“I had stuff to do,” she said. “Besides, I couldn’t do that to my sister or my mom or my dad. I just felt like I had a lot unfinished, but I just wasn’t going to give up.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T07:37:54.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
