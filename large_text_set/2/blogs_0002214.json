Snap’s IPO itself is actually a fundraising event (in addition to getting shareholders some liquidity), which will give the company more cash in order to hunt down these acquisitions. \nWe’ve reported on a lot of acquisitions the company has made over the last year, but Snap laid out some of the specifics in its public filing today: Snap acquired Looksery in August , which at the time was reported to be for around $150 million. The filing basically confirms this price. Snap acquired the company as part of its push to create animated lenses — another product that would help further increase engagement and stickiness for the app, which is what the company is pitching to advertisers as its core value. The Looksery acquisition was $79.4 million, with $71.2 million in retention bonuses. Snap also acquired Bitstrips , the creators of Bitmoji personal avatars, in March last year. Snap paid $64.2 million for the company, which it looks like didn’t include any retention bonuses.
