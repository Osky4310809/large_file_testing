Fox admits that she’ll “always have love” for 50 Cent despite the pair’s lashing of each other on social media . \nDuring a recent appearance on T he Wendy Williams Show , Fox revealed that she ran into Fif’ at the New York Knicks game on January 2 where the former couple spoke briefly and seemingly buried the hatchet. \n“It is so time for this to be over with as far as beefing back and forth,” Fox said. “I walked over to him and I said, ‘Happy New Year.’” \n50 and the actress dated in the early 2000s and after breaking up, they had a rocky relationship that spilled onto Instagram, especially when she appeared on Empire , the rival to 50’s Power . In the new interview, she reiterates her statement from 2015 that she will always have feelings for the G-Unit general . \n“Someone has to be the bigger person, so I walked over to him and we sat, I gave him a hug, we talked for a few minutes and that was that,” Fox continued. “I think [it was] about five [minutes] … I will always have love for him. As much as we’ve been through, I will always have love for him. He was literally like my true love. I hated to have to beef with him, but I ain’t gon’ let nobody mess with me, I ain’t no punk. And y’all know that. I told him last night that ‘I’ll always love you. We’re not meant to be together, but I’ll always have love for you.’” \nSo far, no word from 50.
