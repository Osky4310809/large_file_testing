She’s smart, funny, talented, and her nail game is ON POINT. And Denning’s latest Instagram post – which happened to be a birthday message to her mom — has us laughing out loud.\nNow Dennings is no stranger to the laugh-worthy social media post. She shared her hilarious Christmas gift-giving antics with us around the holidays, and never fails to share the weird or absurd things she sees throughout an average day in L.A. It’s a HUGE part of why we love her (because yes, she’s gorgeous, but making us smile is the true way to our celebrity-loving hearts).\nAnd the fact that she’s able to combine sweet and sarcastic into one perfect message just enforces our feelings all the more.\nThis nice lady is 70 today. Thanks for not leaving me at the supermarket when you had the chance! I love you, Mom. Happy Birthday \nA post shared by Kat Dennings (@katdenningsss) on Feb 18, 2017 at 3:38pm PST \n“Thanks for not leaving me at the super market when you had the chance!” LOL. And also, awwww.\nAnd from the looks of these adorable photobooth pics, Denning’s mom is a lady who knows how to get goofy and appreciates the funny. And if that wasn’t enough to make you smile on this Monday, this surely will (and if it doesn’t, your heart is made of ice! Just kidding. But seriously).\nEarly draft of my dance explosion on tonight's 2 Broke Girls. Will it change the medium of dance/haunt me forever? You decide. 9:30pm on CBS \nA post shared by Kat Dennings (@katdenningsss) on Feb 13, 2017 at 11:46am PST \nAgain, LOL. We could watch these “moves” all day. At any rate, thanks for spreading the smiles, Kat (and Happy b-day to your momsss!). Now excuse us while we continue to peruse your Insta account for hours.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:22:02.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
