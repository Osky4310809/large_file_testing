They both seek to deny Israel’s right to exist. They are both efforts to intimidate her friends and embolden her enemies. They are both extensions of an ancient hatred,” she added. Haley slammed the boycott movement for its complete disregard for truth or history, and for ignoring the human rights violations by countries such as Syria, North Korea and Iran. “It makes absolutely no sense and has no connection to any reasonable definition of justice,” she said. Haley said she felt “privileged” to have passed the U.S.’ first anti-BDS bill", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:00:48.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
