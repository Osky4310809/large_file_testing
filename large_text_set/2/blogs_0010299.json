Because Target has teamed up with everyone's favorite indie cosmetic brand, W3LL PEOPLE , to make luxury green beauty accessible to all! \nLocated in the \"Naturals\" aisle with other stellar natural beauty brands, the W3LL PEOPLE Target launch invites you to buy your makeup while you peruse all the latest skin and hair care must-haves, creating a one-stop, paraben-free, sulfate-free, cruelty-free, organic shopping experience. Who doesn't want a more positive choice when it comes to your everyday beauty and health choices? It's Mother Nature for your makeup bag! \nNot sure where to begin? Check out W3LL PEOPLE's award-winning mascara, complexion-perfecting makeup, and user-friendly formulations that cleverly bridge the gap between makeup and skin care. Formulated by W3LL PEOPLE's co-founder and makeup maestro Shirley Pinkson , these products take your natural makeup regimen to the next level. Shirley spent 10 years at NARS before she jumped the fence and co-created this plant-based line that creates dramatic, results-oriented makeup using premium botanical ingredients. \nYou'll find all these beauty favorites in select Target locations to get a glowing, radiant look! Here's the ultimate W3LL PEOPLE beauty bag you need in your life right now: 1. Expressionist Mascara \nW3LL PEOPLE's all-natural, pro-grade mascara formula can take your less-than-fluffy natural lashes to new extremes without subjecting them to harsh chemicals or dyes. The clump-resistant wand lifts and separates lashes while the nutrient-rich formula coats them with a luxe, glossy black color. ADVERTISEMENT 2. Expressionist Liquid Eyeliner \nComplement your look-at-me lashes with this holy grail liquid eyeliner , a happy alternative to toxic, lead-based kohl pencils. It glides on beautifully without skipping, dragging, or tugging the skin thanks to a high-tech felt-tip brush. 3. Bio Tint Multi-Action Moisturizer \nAchieve flawless one-step perfection with W3LL PEOPLE's lightweight beauty balm, a hybrid tinted moisturizer-meets-sunscreen that bridges the gap between makeup and skin care and protects while it improves skin quality. Available in three adaptive shades to complement every skin tone, this broccoli-seed oil formulation blends seamlessly into your skin for a natural, luminous look. 4. Bio Correct Multi-Action Concealer \nThis ultra-light correcting concealer comes in three universally flattering shades and blends and covers easily with a mousse-like texture. The best part, however, is its powerful blend of organic algae, coffee, pomegranate, and anti-aging peptides which depuff, brighten, and smooth skin. Oh, and it does all of this while hiding imperfections and providing a bright and rested look. 5. Natural Contour and Highlight Duo \nThis dynamic duo contains a magic illuminizing cream that creates a hydrated, happy glow instantly, while brightening and healing your complexion, plus a beautiful bronzing contour cream to add dimension to your features and fake the warmth of summertime—all without a heavy film and absolutely no creasing. \nApply and blend the luminizer above cheekbones, on the bridge of the nose, on your cupid's bow, at the crown of the forehead, and underneath the brow. The bronzer should be swept onto cheekbones, forehead, nose, and chin. Easily add that healthy, radiant look to skin, with or without those vitamin D-filled rays! 6. Bio Brightener Invisible Powder \nThis heavenly, ultra-fine loose powder is designed to provide invisible coverage and a radiant, soft-focus effect that blurs fine lines and softens imperfections, thanks to crushed freshwater pearl. This translucent powder comes in one universal shade that adapts to all skin tones to instantly create a naturally flawless complexion with a youthful glow. 7. Nudist Multi-Use Color Duo Palette \nW3LL PEOPLE does multitasking vegan cosmetics like no one else! Add a gorgeous sheer, natural color to your cheeks, lips, and eyes with this lush and creamy formula. Rich in skin-soothing organic aloe and antioxidants to hydrate and improve overall skin quality, the duo includes two flattering nude shades for all ages and skin tones. It blends beautifully with fingertips, for a quick and easy application. \nReady to grab these natural beauty favorites at your local Target?
