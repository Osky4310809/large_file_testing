All of their moves have improved the roster, further bettering their already impressive Super Bowl odds. \nThe rest of the league has obviously taken notice, and Raiders coach Jack Del Rio is among them. He weighed in on New England’s additions, and they do seem to worry him a bit. Del Rio on the #Patriots moves: \"I do cringe a little bit. Cooks can really create separation.\" \n— Vic Tafur (@VicTafur) March 28, 2017 \nCooks is the headliner of the group, who Robert Kraft said is the Patriots’ best weapon since Randy Moss. That’s quite the praise for a guy who hasn’t taken a snap in New England, but it also shows how highly the Patriots think of him. \nThe Raiders have taken a bit more of a guarded approach to free agency, making Jared Cook, Cordarrelle Patterson and Marshall Newhouse their top additions. \nOakland has a good core of receivers currently in Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper, but it’s easy to see why Del Rio might be worried. The Patriots are absolutely loaded once again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:32:33.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
