Your money, 14 minutes, they can get a bus to Norwich. And then they go to Bournemouth on a private jet and these private jets, theyâ€™ve got showers on! 2,500 TV channels just in case they get bored, these poor little players on a 14 minute trip to Bournemouth.\nAndrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff has stopped playing (Getty) â€˜You know and then youâ€™ve got the poor fellas forking out, theyâ€™re subsiding this. Theyâ€™re paying for this travel!\nâ€˜Sort it out, how can you look at your fans in the eye? How can you look at them when youâ€™re wasting god knows how much money on travel?â€™\nArsene Wenger defending flying to Norwich in 2015 â€˜When we made the decision there was some roadworks planned. Sometimes the access to Norwich is difficult, so we decided to fly. But itâ€™s not a lot of difference. \nâ€˜We do not fly a lot any more. We take a train or coach. This is an exception. Now, we have a new coach. \nâ€˜When you go to Birmingham, we took the train a lot because the traffic was impossible on a Friday afternoon on the M1. \nâ€˜Now we found a solution is that we have dinner here and travel afterwards. So we go 7.30 to 9.30 and that usually goes well. We have no traffic problems. \nâ€˜Before, when you left at 3 oâ€™clock, we never knew when we would arrive.â€™ \nMore: Football Real Madrid ace hints he has HUGE problem with Arsenal star on social media \nMourinho: These are the types of players I want to bring to Manchester United \nMan Utd and Liverpool stars caught up in shocking pitch invasion \nFlintoff, who earned millions during a career that saw him play 79 Tests for England and play in the Indian Premier League, said he had no issue with footballersâ€™ wages but their growing inability to identify with their fans.\nâ€˜The people who work day in day out, all week saving up to watch on a Saturday afternoon and we know that the footballers earn thousands, hundreds of thousands.
