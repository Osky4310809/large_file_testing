It alleges that Russia has compromising information on Trump. The report is unverified, and was in the hands of D.C. insiders, the FBI and CIA leadership and some journalists long before election day. \nMore than the lurid sexual allegations, the report claims various contacts between Trump aides and Russian operatives during the election and overwhelmingly suggests Mr. Trump has a lot at personal stake when it comes to dealings with the Russian government. \nThe dossier, which is a collection of memos written over a period of months, includes specific, unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations of contact between Trump aides and Russian operatives, and graphic claims of sexual acts documented by the Russians. CNN reported Tuesday that a two-page synopsis of the report was given to President Barack Obama and Trump. Now BuzzFeed News is publishing the full document so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government. ... \nThe documents have circulated for months and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials who have seen them. Mother Jones writer David Corn referred to the documents in a late October column. Harry Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson tweeted Tuesday that the former Senate Democratic leader had seen the documents before writing a public letter to FBI Director James Comey about Trump’s ties to Russia. And CNN reported Tuesday that Arizona Republican John McCain gave a “full copy” of the memos to Comey on Dec. 9, but that the FBI already had copies of many of the memos. \nThe key claims in the unverified report: \n• Russia has been \"assisting\" Trump for at least five years as part of an effort to destabilize Western politics. \n• Trump has refused real estate deals offered in Russia, while accepting intelligence protips. \n• The FSB has \"compromised\" Trump on trips to Moscow by recording \"perverted\" sexual activity; the golden showers thing. \n• They have similar surveillance of Hillary Clinton, but it's just phone calls and such, does not involve embarrassing conduct, and the Russians haven't decided to put it out there. \nThe #GoldenShowers hashtag is under heavy use this evening on Twitter. \nImportant Reminder: no photos, no problem .
