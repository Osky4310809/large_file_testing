He met a lot of the community and practised the sport of parkour with them there. \n“He passed away due to a train accident - he was with his friends while it happened.” \nPhotographs on his social media accounts show the teenager leaping between buildings in Hong Kong and somersaulting on the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland. \nFriends paid tribute online. Toby Segar wrote: “Those who knew Nye Frankie Newman will never forget his untouchable flare, enthusiasm and thirst for raw adventure and worldly experience. A fresh young soul who effortlessly inspired those around him, fuelling the progress of fellow athletes and most prominently, his vast network of like-minded and incredibly close friends. \n“We lost a good lad, too early.” \nSeb Koci said: “He was a truly remarkable example of a human being. Although ‘inspirational’ is quite cliche, he had such a genuine ability to capture the hearts and minds of everyone he met, he had an insatiable appetite for adventure and was the driving force behind a huge number of seemingly stupid ideas and plans which I now hold as some of my fondest memories.” \nJames Dickson added: “Such an inspirational guy has just lost his life, it’s such a shock and just shows us that life is delicate, Nye lived his life to the fullest and will be missed by many, rest in peace man.” \nA mass parkour “training” event is planned on March 4 in Guildford town centre to celebrate his life.
