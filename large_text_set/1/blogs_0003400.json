Morgan St. Coffee lovers should take note as the hotel will feature the Midwest’s first cafe from Stumptown Coffee Roasters , the venerable Portland, Ore. company. The hotel will also have a rooftop bar on its seventh floor, as well as a ground-floor restaurant, according to Chicago. Ace will collaborate with a “regional chef” on the restaurant concept. They’ve yet to reveal any further details. There are eight Ace hotels across the country, as well as a property in Panama. The rooftop space in Chicago will be available all year. The project looks like competition for Soho House, the nearby private boutique hotel in the West Loop off Randolph Street. Stumptown Cafes are staples at Ace Hotel locations, which counts a total of 12 cafes across the country: six in Portland.; two in Seattle; two in New York; one in Los Angeles; and one in New Orleans . Much like Chicago’s own cult-favorite, Intelligentsia, Peet’s Coffee owns Stumptown. Both deals were made within weeks of each other back in 2015 .
