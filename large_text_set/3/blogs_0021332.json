The boy’s mother, Kelly Porter, said Ziebarth had to go.\n“He got what he deserved. I’m not being mean, but think about it. September 2nd, when this whole incident originally started, the teacher was suspended. You know, they had to go through this humiliation, being embarrassed, being put on the news. The teachers should have learned their lessons then, you know? Don’t violate children’s rights,” she said.\nWBBM has been unable to reach Ziebarth. \nStudents started a petition on change.org demanding Ziebarth be brought back. More than 300 people have signed the petition.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:02:33.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
