As for North Korea, Trump said he would consider pressuring China to exert more influence on Pyongyang (the North Korean capital) due to the rogue nation’s latest ballistic missile test .\nFollowing his victory in 2016 election, Trump has said that America must increase its nuclear capabilities, and suggested an end to nonproliferation policy with a new “arms race.”\n[image via screengrab]\n— —\n>> Follow Ken Meyer (@KenMeyer91) on Twitter\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Freuters-trump-wants-to-expand-nuclear-weapons-capability-make-it-top-of-the-pack%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/europe/russia-cruise-missile-arms-control-treaty.html", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://twitter.com/KenMeyer91", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Freuters-trump-wants-to-expand-nuclear-weapons-capability-make-it-top-of-the-pack%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PicMonkey-Collage-Trump1.jpg&description=Reuters%3A%20Trump%20Wants%20to%20Expand%20Nuclear%20Weapons%20Capability%2C%20Make%20it%20%26%238216%3BTop%20of%20the%20Pack%26%238217%3B", "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-idUSKBN1622IF?il=0"], "published": "2017-02-24T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:14:24.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
