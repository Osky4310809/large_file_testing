Chelsea Bunz is a professional piercer and also the person who did my own VCH – this woman has seen more of me than pretty much anyone other than my boyfriend.\nI think genital piercing has always been popular – it’s just discussed more openly these days, which makes it increasingly acceptable to the mainstream. People from all classes and professions have them – you’d be amazed at some of the outwardly unlikely people who have ‘secret’ piercings.\nEveryone has genitals and part of my job is to help relieve people’s nerves – being horrified at seeing a ladygarden would not be useful! I honestly don’t view them any different to an ear.\nI’ve seen bad piercings – bad placements and badly fitting or poor quality jewellery. I spend a lot of time helping people who have had bad experiences in the past.\nPiercings aren’t at all unhygienic, most people who have them are sensible and know how to care for them and I always discuss aftercare during consultations. Most people have already done some research or have other body piercings.\nThey are aware of how to care for both the piercing and the jewellery and do a great job in doing so.\nPiercings do not spread STIs or increase the chance of catching one – unsafe sex does that.\nI would say the majority of people have piercings for themselves, but sometimes you do meet people who want to improve their love lives. No professional will undertake any piercing if they think the client is being over encouraged by a partner.\nI also wouldn’t do any piercing unless the anatomy is correct for that particular piercing and safe to do so.\nDon’t worry, it’s not that bad (Picture: Minerva Freire for Metro.co.uk) For me personally, it was sheer aesthetics – I just like how it looks. Even if I was the only person who ever saw my piercing, I’d like it in the same way that I like having painted toenails – something pretty for my own personal pleasure.\nAnd clitoral piercings can enhance sensation, because of the metal bar that’s pretty much constantly in contact with the surrounding nerve endings. It’s sparkly and it feels good – what’s not to like?\nSome people have more profound reasons for piercing. Lynne is 35 and from Cumbria – she told me the thoughts behind her own decoration.\nInitially I think I wanted a VCH because it was a bit ‘out there’ and I like to try unusual things.\nBut when I made the decision to actually go ahead with it, it was as a kind of declaration of self-love. I have had some significant issues with sex and sexuality throughout my life and am constantly trying to teach myself to overcome that. So having what is possibly the most sexual body part I have pierced was basically a massive ‘f*ck you’ to my demons.\nAs for how it feels? Amazing. At first I found it very strange as I could feel it all the time. I nearly took it out after a few days because it was quite triggering being turned on so much. But over time it has only been a positive thing.\nIt’s a lot easier for me to become aroused now, which for me is a MASSIVE deal. I also actively use it for stimulation as it provides a different kind of feeling.\nIt’s a personal accomplishment for me and really has been part of my self therapy – with the added bonus of having a sparkly foo!\nThere is a great deal of satisfaction to be had from taking control of our own bodies and decorating them however we please.\nBut what about the men?\nWhereas clitoral hood piercings only go through the thinnest of tissue (and even labial piercings are fairly simple), male genital piercings involve a bar being placed right through the penis. Ouch.\nOuch (Picture: Metro) By far the most common piercing for men is the Prince Albert (PA), named after Queen Victoria’s consort, who was alleged to have had just such an adornment – the story is undoubtedly false but the name has stuck.\nThe PA consists of a heavy-gauge curved bar (or ring with a ball-closure) entering down the urethra and coming out through the underside of the penis, just below the ridge where the glans joins the shaft. A far less common version is the ‘reverse PA’, which again enters through the urethra but exits through a hole pierced through the upper side of the glans.\nMore People are deeply confused by Topshop's 'clear knee mom jeans' \nBody positive Instagrammer gets real about her severe PMS bloating \nThis surgeon says he can increase the size of your penis by injecting it with blood \nI have far more knowledge of these piercings than most people as my own boyfriend has both. I personally love them, but I know he did them for himself (although he did ask me beforehand if I would mind him adding the reverse PA, and rightly so – let’s face it, I’m the one who has to deal with all this metalwork in the bedroom).\nI asked him what the appeal was of piercings that would seem to many as being quite extreme.\nI had my PA done at the age of 23 after splitting from a girlfriend. That one was bravado, I guess – and for the record it didn’t hurt much.\nIt’s been a slippery slope ever since! Apart from the PA and reverse PA, I also have a scrotal ladder as well as pierced nipples and various dermals. As a life model it certainly raises eyebrows on occasion.\nI can’t really explain why the process is enjoyable, but a large part of it is connected to a personal mastery over fear, as well as the endorphin rush.\nIt’s more common than you’d think (Picture: Shutterstock/Metro) I asked Aidan Johnson from Adorn Body Art about the technicalities of male piercing.\nThe reverse PA is quite rare actually, because it’s pretty brutal. And it takes a while to heal. But the PA itself has always been popular – in fact body piercing itself is pretty much as old as humanity itself. Tutankhamen had his navel pierced.\nWith some male genital piercing I do have to ask fairly intimate questions about the client’s sex life – you shouldn’t have an apadravya piercing if you’re into anal sex for example, as it could cause serious damage to your partner.\nIf a couple both have piercings then I talk things through with them so that they’re compatible.\nThere’s a lot you can do with male piercings and they’re not at all harmful if they’re cared for properly. And we use much heavier gauge jewellery on men – you don’t want to end up with a ‘cheese wire effect’ on your penis!\nGenital piercings are particularly popular with men in high power professions – it’s something hidden away that no one can see but they know is there.\nOne last point – NEVER ever attempt a genital piercing yourself.\nYes, there are home kits available online and no, you should never use them. Read up on it, find a good studio and put yourself in the hands of a professional.\nThen lie back and admire your glittery bits.\nMORE: WAM: Everything you need to know about wet and messy sex \nMORE: Hot or not: Could watching yourself having sex in a mirror improve your love life?
