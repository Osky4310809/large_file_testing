Lehmann tried to pull Holland through the leg side but hit Harper in the head in his follow-through. \nThe 20-year-old keeper fell to the turf and appeared significantly distressed, and was taken to hospital as a precaution. \nAfter much deliberation, Head and his team came to the decision they wouldn’t allow Victoria to replace Harper, much to Holland’s disappointment. \n“Most of the blokes were pretty disappointed with South Australia and the way they reacted to it,” Holland said on RSN radio on Tuesday. “Not letting us get a replacement player was pretty poor in my opinion, so it did fire a few of us up.” \nCricket Australia’s new Concussion and Head Trauma policy means substitutes for players who are concussed are allowed in one-day domestic and T20 cricket, but the ICC rejected the rule when it came to being applied to first-class and international cricket. \nIf Victoria did replace Harper, the match may have lost its first-class status, and the winner would have risked sacrificing the points gained. \n“As a group, with no concussion rule (in place), we came to the decision that it wasn’t going to be allowed and, rightly or wrongly, that is the way we went,” Head said. “It was definitely a tough decision, but we had a process of getting to that decision, and the group is 100 per cent behind that. \n“Going on this season with the amount of concussions, that (rule) is probably something that needs to be looked into.” \nVictoria’s cricket manager Shaun Graf agreed things needed to change, saying: “I think there certainly is grounds for that replacement player” on SEN radio on Monday. \nThe incident involving Harper was the second time this summer a wicketkeeper has been struck by a bat, after Melbourne Renegades wicketkeeper Peter Nevill was hit by Brad Hodge’s stray willow during the Big Bash League. You don’t expect that as a wicketkeeper. Source: Supplied Harper was taken to hospital. Source: Supplied \nThe loss of Harper didn’t affect Victoria though, who went on to win the match. \nSouth Australia slipped to a 124-run defeat despite bowling out the Bushrangers on day one for a modest 204. The result puts the Bushrangers in the box seat at the top of the Sheffield Shield ladder. \nThe Redbacks’ batting again let them down again on Sunday, out for 188, the third innings in a row they had failed to reach 200. It was a second home defeat in little more than a week for the Redbacks, who also lost unexpectedly against Western Australia. \nPrior to the mid-season break, South Australia had won three of its five matches, holding a strong grip on second and within touching distance of the Bushrangers. \nHead, who has spent the past month with the Australian team, was at a loss to adequately explain the dip in form. “I have been away for a month and I chatted to a lot of the guys, and their thoughts and processes are the same,” he said. \n“Everyone has got their minds exactly as they did before Christmas, and it is just one of those things that we are not playing as well as we could be. \n“In the last two games the bowlers have been bowling quite well, but unfortunately we are not just getting the job done with the bat.” \nThe Redbacks face Queensland next where a third straight loss could relegate South Australia to fourth. \n— with AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:17:36.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
