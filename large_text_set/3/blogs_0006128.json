If there are two actors we will watch in almost anything it’s them.\nReynolds we love because of his never-ending, always hilarious sense of humor . \nMorena Baccarin we love, well, obviously because she’s gorgeous, but also because she’s talented and can also be pretty damn funny at times.\nOne of those times was today as she dropped a masterpiece in the trolling arts on Instagram aimed at her Deadpool co-star Ryan Reynolds.\nHappy International Women's Day @vancityreynolds https://t.co/kgoov8ifU2 \n— Morena Baccarin (@missmorenab) March 8, 2017 \n\n\nI wonder if that’s the kind of “ sexual chemistry ” they were so happy about after Baccarin’s Deadpool screen test…\n\n \n@missmorenab @VancityReynolds Haha. Perfect!\n— Daniel McLean (@DanielJMcLean) March 8, 2017 \n\nIndeed. \nCan’t wait to see if Reynolds decides to respond. Fingers crossed and we’ll update you here if he does.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T20:31:08.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
