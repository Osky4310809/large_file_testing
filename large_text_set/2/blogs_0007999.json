We're barely more than a month into 2017, yet we've already picked the 17 films that we're genuinely most excited about for the year ahead. There are a lot of heavy-hitters in here, too, ranging from the usual Marvel and DC fare to Star Wars: The Last Jedi and a few other very different flicks. \nRight now it's mostly big-budget blockbusters, since those are scheduled out years in advance and teased incessantly for months, but we'll be updating this list throughout the year to bring in more indies, under-the-radar fare, and freshly-announced flicks. Be sure to check back! Get Out (24 February) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRfnevzM9kQ?wmode=opaque\">Embedded video</a> \nJordan Peele is best known as half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, but Get Out – which he both wrote and directed – is something very different. It's a shocking horror flick, sure, but it's also a pointed reflection of racism in America. \nA trip to meet his white girlfriend's family quickly turns from unease to insanity, as Chris discovers that African American men have frequently disappeared from the town. And then things get weird . It looks to have all the thrills of modern horror flicks with a healthy dose of social commentary, and early reviews have been unanimously glowing . Logan (3 March) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Div0iP65aZo?wmode=opaque\">Embedded video</a> \nIf there's any justice in the world, Logan – the third standalone Wolverine flick, and reportedly the last time that Hugh Jackman will portray the comic hero – will finally do justice to the beloved X-Men hero. Logan finds him in a dark place: older and with his powers diminished, and clearly in a rough stretch. He works with an also-fading Professor X to protect a young mutant girl, and if the trailer is any indication, prepare for some waterworks. It's also slated to be the most violent and vulgar of the trio, making this perhaps the most authentic depiction of Wolverine to date.

It's set in the 1970s, when a group of explorers finds the beast after arriving on an uncharted island. Whoops. Skull Island is loaded with talented actors, ranging from Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson to Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, and John C. Reilly, and it looks thoroughly intense. We'll get another Godzilla standalone flick in 2019 before the two monsters battle it out in 2020. Life (24 March) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cuA-xqBw4jE?wmode=opaque\">Embedded video</a> \nDiscovering life in space would be… exciting? Disturbing? Potentially dangerous to all of mankind? Life seems to span all of those outcomes in the course of a single movie, as the discovery of an alien organism quickly becomes a serious and horrifying threat. \nJake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, and Ryan Reynolds lead this thriller as astronauts on the International Space Station, who discover the creature on a recovered space probe and start experimenting with it. Bad idea. Looks quite a bit darker than The Martian , eh?
