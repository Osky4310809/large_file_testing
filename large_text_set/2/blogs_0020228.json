The new battle ground for illegal live football streaming \nSo whilst some of the top leagues on the planet are now implementing official broadcasts on Facebook Live, the pirates have been doing this for some time. \nThere are now tens of pages on Facebook that show pirated live streams from the biggest matches in the world and are enjoying millions of views. \nYou no longer need to search for links on pirated websites, as in the days of the now defunct Rojadirecta . Just give a like to the right page on Facebook. El Clasico on Facebook Live \nTraditionally, any El Clasico match between Real Madrid and Barcelona is the most watched game on the planet. \nLast December’s encounter in the Camp Nou saw Real Madrid bag a late equaliser through Sergio Ramos and was reportedly watched by 600 million people in 185 countries. \nBut, these figures do not count the pirated Facebook Live broadcasts. One Spanish Facebook page, named Capitanes del Fútbol had 700,000 people watching their broadcast concurrently and had an estimated 4.6 million views in total. How to build up Facebook followers to football pages \nMany of those who are pushing illegal streams on Facebook are following many of the same rules widely prevalent in social media today. \nPush football photos, videos, memes, photoshops and GIFs that sit on Facebook and attract a wider audience to a specific page. \nThese major football Facebook pages, attracting millions of likes, can then share other pages that stream live games. “If one closes they open more” \nSome of the Facebook pages for live games are pulled after they have shown one match, whilst the share from the bigger account is also deleted. \nAs a result many millions of football fans on Facebook are able to watch live games and after the event there is absolutely no trace of the footage on the website or app. \nLa Liga are amongst the major leagues to have recognised the problem of Facebook Live streams. \nThe Spanish top flight tell El Pais : “We have agreements with social media platforms to track illegal content. With Twitter, for example, it is automatically deleted when we detect it. In the case of Facebook they have their own tool, so making these videos disappear is faster. But if one closes they open more.” \nA La Liga spokesman continues: “From Facebook they simply refer us to their general rules of publication, in which they are committed ‘to help individuals and organizations to protect their intellectual property rights.'” The power of Facebook Live \nFacebook released the ability for anyone to stream live in late 2015. Throughout 2016 Facebook pushed live broadcasts to the top of their users news feeds. \nThe Facebook algorithm pushes live video to its users in a much bigger manner than articles – even those that run Facebook Instant – whereby the content is hosted on Facebook itself. \nIn recent days, Facebook appear to have stopped pushing notifications for Facebook Live but have instead started pushing broadcasts to users who do not even like the specific page it is coming from. The most powerful publishing tool known to humankind \nIt is no exaggeration to say that Facebook is the most powerful publishing tool known to humankind and this has become a double edged sword for rights holders. \nTechnically, any phone with internet connection can broadcast a live video on Facebook. \nAs a result, Facebook has faced serious pressures surrounding Facebook Live and its incredible reach, which are far greater than football live streaming. \nNevertheless, you can understand why watching football live on Facebook (or on any social media platform) is here to stay. Passive consumers \nOne of the key aspects of this new generation of piracy is that the consumer is virtually passive. \nNo longer do football fans have to browse pirated pages and try out links to see whether the stream works. \nNor will they be bombarded with pop up ads and chat boxes that ruin the experience of actually watching the football. \nIn essence, someone who joins these pages is just part of a community that likes football. In fact, sometimes it is not even necessary to follow them: if one of your friends gives it a Like or shares the live stream, it can appear on your Facebook news feed without you even looking for it. \nWhich begs the next question, many of you are probably asking: Is watching an unofficial stream on Facebook Live illegal? \nThe passive nature of how many people use Facebook means the idea of doing something illegal is actively lowered. \nIt is going to be very difficult for the rights holders to prove that everyone watching these illegal streams on Facebook Live is actually doing anything illegal. \nLike much of the internet legislation over the past decade or so, the law is lagging well beyond the incredible advances in technology. So how do these Facebook pages profit from live streams? \nIt is now in the interests of Facebook pages that show unofficial streams to not attempt to make money from the live streams. \nWith reference to the legality question above, this would open up some pages to serious law suits if they were profiting from the live streams themselves. \nIt is also worth noting that Facebook currently don’t offer any monetisation tools for Facebook Live to regular users or those that are not part of big publisher groups. Affiliation for links & articles \nHowever, the website 90min became the first football website in recent years to start an affiliate system for articles. \nSo some of these major Facebook pages need to grow in order to push articles from 90min and other sites such as goal.com and The Sun, who also recently began article affiliate systems. \nThe bigger the Facebook page, the more opportunity to make money from click throughs to an article. \nYou might not like the “Click Bait” articles you see on social media – but there is a clear business model behind them. \nBy sharing Facebook Live broadcasts of major games, individual Facebook pages can grow and then make more money on articles and links they share. \nThere are now early suggestions in Spain that the sites funding these Facebook pages could be implicated as providing the monetisation for these illegal Facebook Live broadcasts. So what now? \nUltimately, football’s governing bodies have failed the regular fan. \nWith so much money in the top echelons of the game, and the importance of supporters, it is staggering how much football on TV still costs. \nSo called “chord cutters” were inevitable when in England you have to pay for Sky Sports and BT Sport, to see all Premier League games. \nNot to mention the fact 3pm Saturday games are not televised to fans in the UK. But are freely available anywhere else in the world. \nFacebook is so powerful and dominant in the social media landscape – they also own Instagram and WhatsApp – that it would be a huge surprise if Mark Zuckerberg’s company did not take an even greater share of this market. \nSure, Facebook will move to stop illegal Facebook Live streams – but how long can the big boys e.g. the Premier League and World Cup (FIFA), stay off a platform which has dominated the mobile internet? \n*** \n101 Great Goals produces a Facebook Live show twice a week – every Monday and Thursday.
