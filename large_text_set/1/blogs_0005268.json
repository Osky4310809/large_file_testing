It's even been suggested that his election is one of the worst things to happen to the United States in the last 100 years. His actions so far, from appointing corporate cronies to regulate business and banking to siding with Russia after that country was accused of trying to rig our election via hacking, are poised to make that observation come true. \nThe flip side of a Trump presidency, though, is that it puts his foes in a natural, defensive position — and that could be a good thing. Progressives are hardwired to fight the status quo. Liberals are born contrarians. And L.A. is a city of progressives and liberals. Trump gives foes plenty of leverage not just to lash out but also to organize and unify, to inspire the base and to hold the president accountable. \nHere are five ways Trump's presidency actually could have a positive effect on Los Angeles: \n5. Cops will sing \"Kumbaya\" with immigrants \nPolice are reaffirming their vow not to help federal authorities deport people who are in the United States illegally. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, reacting to Trump's election , said in November, \"We are not going to engage in law enforcement activities solely based on somebody’s immigration status.\" While this is nothing new — the LAPD has long argued that it needs the trust of L.A.'s sizable immigrant community in order to do its job — it represented the opening shots in a simmering battle between the Trump administration and local government.

Council president Herb Wesson proposed that the city create an immigrant advocate's office to \"protect residents against mass deportations\" and to \"ensure the city continues to receive all grants, loans and other eligible federal funding,\" according to a statement from his office. City and county governments then joined forces to create a $10 million fund to help local immigrants facing deportation obtain legal representation.

Ethnic groups will find common ground \nMinority groups should be natural allies on many issues, but in a city as complex as Los Angeles, this is rarely the case. In the not-so-distant past Latino and African-American gangs waged war against each other, Latinos committed hate crimes against blacks, some Asian-American politicians embraced minorities' traditional foe, the GOP, and some African-Americans lashed out against immigrants as criminals and job thieves. But never before have these groups been more unified against a common enemy — in this case, Trump and his allegedly racist, sexist and classist ways. This could be an opportunity for a new Rainbow Coalition in Los Angeles. \n2.
