KJo’s war of words with Kangana led to a huge debate on nepotism in the film industry. \nAt the launch of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan ‘s book, Master on Masters, Karan had a funny conversation with Suhel Seth – that involved Kangana Ranaut . The conversation that reportedly happened was such that Suhel complimented Karan that he did not look his age, 44, to which he replied that he was honoured to listen something polite from him. \nSuhel then said that he doesn’t “believe in politics of hatred and that affection has a much more charming virtue. Karan then said: \nI have three words to ask- who are you? \nPat came the reply, “Kangana”, after which Karan laughed and said: \nReally? Then I am going to run out of here. \nWell well! Wonder what Kangana has to say about this fun little chat! 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:53:42.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
