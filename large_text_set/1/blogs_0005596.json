Another person went back to California.‚Äù\nHe also noted that in some cases, victims reported the rape at the hospital but didn‚Äôt pursue legal action against their attacker.\nID: 10281240 3. Rose echoed his comments at a Community Council meeting on Wednesday, saying ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not total abomination rapes where strangers are being dragged off the streets.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a true stranger rape, a random guy picks up a stranger off the street, those are the troubling ones. That person has, like, no moral standards,‚Äù he said, according to DNA Info .\nID: 10281243 4. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Stephen P. Davis said Rose‚Äôs comments ‚Äúdid not properly explain the complexity of issues involved with investigating rape complaints:‚Äù Every report of rape is thoroughly investigated by specially trained detectives in the NYPD‚Äôs Special Victims Unit. All complaints of rape and other types of sexual crimes are taken seriously whether they are committed by domestic partners, acquaintances, or strangers.\nDue to the anonymous and random nature of rapes committed by strangers, detectives often face greater challenges in these types of crimes. Regardless, all sexual offenses are taken seriously.\nID: 10281893 5. UltraViolet, a national women‚Äôs advocacy organization, has called for Rose to be fired immediately. ‚ÄúRape is a crime‚Äîwhether you know the rapist or not, whether you are on Tinder or not‚Äîand it is the responsibility of law enforcement to investigate, prosecute and hold rapists accountable for their crimes‚Äîperiod, full stop,‚Äù UltraViolet co-founder Nita Chaudhary said in a statement.\n‚ÄúThese remarks are deeply disturbing coming from a police captain. An increase in rape should alarm the NYPD and cause them to redouble their efforts to arrest rapists. Instead, Captain Peter Rose and the NYPD are engaging in victim-blaming of the worst kind while judging which rapes they deem to be legitimate and which they do not. With comments like these, it is not surprising that survivors of sexual assault don‚Äôt feel comfortable reporting and cooperating with police authorities who dismiss the seriousness of violence against women.\n‚ÄúThe New York Police Department should immediately fire Captain Peter Rose for his dangerous and unacceptable views. Survivors of sexual assault and all New Yorkers deserve better.‚Äù\nID: 10281532 6.
