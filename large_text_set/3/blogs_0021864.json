Studios’ Ladycastle #2 Tackles “That Pesky Werewolf Problem” by Teresa Jusino | 3:11 pm, March 21st, 2017 Cover by Ashley A. Woods \nWe have been so thrilled with BOOM! Studios’ new limited series, Ladycastle , written by Delilah S. Dawson. Last month, we were able to offer you an exclusive preview of the first issue of the four-part fantasy series, and we’re at it again this month! Our friends at BOOM! have shared some exclusive preview pages with us of the latest issue, and this time, there’s werewolves. \nThere’s also a big change. Whereas Ashley A. Woods did interior art on the first issue, art duties on the series have been taken over by Becca Farrow. However, we still get Woods’ talents on the issue’s cover, as you can see above. Here is the official solicit information for Issue #2, and you can check out the preview pages in the gallery below. Enjoy! \nLadycastle #2 (of 4)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:09:09.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
