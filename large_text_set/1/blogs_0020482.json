R ght. What a farce.” The alleged tweet has been removed from Twitter but a screenshot is now being shared on Facebook. Other tweets critical of women marchers, purportedly posted by Paterno, are also being shared on social media. \nIt appears that Paterno’s Twitter account has been deleted. \nStefanie Murphy of Park Ridge, who has one child, expressed displeasure over Paterno’s tweets. “Particularly given the tenor of the march over issues related to women, this vulgar term was a disappointment,” she stated. \nPaterno submitted his letter of resignation to Dr. Anthony Borrelli , President, Board of Education, stating, “I wrote some provocative tweets re: the recent women’s marches. In retrospect, they were inappropriate and pushed too far in some way.” \nHe continued, “While I merely meant to harshly criticize some of the protestors (especially the very angry, hostile, vulgar, and violent ones) and question the motives of some of them, my tweets were understandably misinterpreted to mean that I disrespect or hate all the protestors.” \nPark Ridge-Niles Superintendent Dr. Laurie Heinz confirmed Paterno’s resignation via email with CBS 2’s Roseanne Tellez . “We find it truly unfortunate that his personal views have become connected to the important work we are doing here in District 64, especially as we inspire children to become informed, caring and responsible global citizens,” she wrote in an email. \nPark Ridge-Niles School District 64 issued a statement from Dr. Heinz. “Dr. Paterno has tendered his resignation effective immediately as a result of posts to his personal Twitter account yesterday,” it stated. \nMurphy believes Paterno’s resignation from the school board is a “satisfactory conclusion.” She says Paterno’s tweets “reminded us all of why we were marching in the first place.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:38:38.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
