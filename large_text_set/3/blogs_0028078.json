The Denver District Court ruled in favor of the COGCC and Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman. The teenagers appealed, arguing that District Judge Eric Elliff misinterpreted the plain language of lawmakers’ mandate to the COGCC, and erred in denying the proposed rule on drilling. \nThe ruling does not mean the COGCC must adopt the teenagers’ proposal to restrict new drilling, however. It means the COGCC illegally rejected it and sends the case back to the district court. \n“We disagree with the majority and believe the District Court and the dissenting opinion have it right,” said COGCC spokesman Todd Hartman, according to the Denver Post. “We are evaluating whether to appeal this decision to the Colorado Supreme Court.” \nEnvironmental advocacy group Earthworks lauded the ruling as backup for towns and cities weighing measures to increase protection of health and the environment. \n“This shifts health, safety and welfare concerns above development-as-usual permitting,” Earthworks energy program director Bruce Baizel told The Denver Post. “Now the state of Colorado, after removing communities’ power to ban fracking and drilling themselves, might have to effectively ban fracking inside cities to protect residents’ health.” \nVia RT .
