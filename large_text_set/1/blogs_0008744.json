But nervousness remained. People protest against the 'gasolinazo,' the rise of fuel prices in Mexico City, Mexico, on Jan. 7, 2017. SASHENKA GUTIERREZ / EPA \nOfficials in Veracruz, one of the states hardest-hit by the looting on Wednesday and Thursday, said some neighborhood groups had begun to form patrols of residents armed with staves or machetes to ward off looters. \nVeracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes Linares said 532 people had been detained in his state alone and that social rumors of further looting — apparently unfounded — had caused \"an artificial psychosis.\" \nHe said that in the northern part of the state, given this psychosis, \"the neighbors decided to arm themselves with staves, machetes, creating the impression that there were armed groups of criminals.\" \nYunes Linares said the government was trying to convince residents to stop such patrolling. \nThe Interior Department reported a total of more than 1,500 people have been detained for looting or disturbances nationwide since protests began early in the week.

HUGO ORTUNO / EPA \nIt is unclear how many have been charged. Hundreds of stores were looted, mainly on Wednesday and Thursday. Police protection of stores has been stepped up since. \nThe federal police reported continued protests, and some highway blockages, on Saturday. \nThousands of people marched down main avenues in the western city of Guadalajara Saturday to protest the increases, which are part of a government effort to deregulate fuel prices. \nDespite persistent rumors that political interests might have egged on the looters to smear the gas-hike protesters, Yunes Linares said there was \"no evidence that political parties were involved.\" He said authorities were investigating whether criminal gangs had taken part.
