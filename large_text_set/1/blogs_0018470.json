MICHAEL MOORE: I did run into Trump voters. And I asked them, especially -- I remember one woman. I said -- she was telling me that she voted for Trump and I said really? In spite of his attitudes toward women and the things that he said? And she said, well, you know, women, a lot of us, we've just had to learn to take it over the years. And you know, that's how my dad talked and that's how my brothers talk. JOY REID, MSNBC: Ugh. MOORE: And I just thought geez. It was such a reminder of still how far we have to go. I was at this one thing -- John Leguizamo, the brilliant actor and comedian, Hispanic, and he says I'm Hispanic and I always thought racism was our number one problem that we were going to have to deal with. This election really showed that we've ignored the misogyny and the sexism that is still so prevalent and ingrained. And ingrained in many of the victims, the 46% of women that voted for Trump, and the 53% of white women that voted for Trump. And that's just -- well, that just says that we've got more work to do and we'll keep doing it.
