What took Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez this damn long to find each other? Given their keen libidos, “J-Rod” seemed an inevitability, the merged moniker that both these celebrities have trained for all their love lives.\nAs first revealed by Page Six , the superstars have known each other socially for years.\nStill, their spark ignited only about a month ago, after they met again at an event in LA.\nRodriguez had just split with his girlfriend of almost a year , Silicon Valley CEO Anne Wojcicki.\n“Alex and Jennifer ran into each other in LA around four or five weeks ago, rekindled their friendship, then things escalated over the last few weeks,” a source told Page Six.\nThe clincher? A-Rod saw her performing her “All I Have” show in Vegas.\n“Alex went to the show a couple of weeks ago with his friends, and he was blown away,” the source said.\nThe pair have attacked their love lives as they have their careers over the years — with gusto.\nJennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez pose for a photo before a Yankees vs. Mets game in 2005. Anthony J. Causi J.Lo, a multiplatinum recording artist, actress, mother of two and South Bronx native, has been married — and divorced — three times.\nA-Rod was only married once, but there were enough girlfriends before, during and after his marriage to fill Yankee Stadium.\nJ.Lo, 47, started off with a decade-long first love, high-school sweetheart David Cruz, when she was just 15. He proposed; she demurred.\n“I was like a rocket,” she once explained. “He was like a rock.”\nIn 1994, J.Lo briefly dated actor Wesley Snipes , her co-star in the 1995 movie “Money Train.”\nTwo years later, J.Lo met her first husband, Cuban waiter Ojani Noa, at the restaurant where he worked in Miami, where she was filming “Blood and Wine.” Wed in February, 1997, they split in January 1998.\n“My heart was broken in many pieces,” he said last year.\nSo many pieces that in 2011, Noa shopped around a purported honeymoon sex tape.\nAfter splitting with Noa, J.Lo briefly dated longtime friend and collaborator Marc Anthony — though that relationship wouldn’t heat up for another five years.\n\nGetty Images\nEmail Copy Advertisement The salacious, celebrity-filled dating history of 'J-Rod' March 9, 2017 J.Lo rounded out the decade with rumors of her seeing producer Tommy Mottola . By the end, she was in a relationship with Sean “Diddy” Combs , who helped her with her debut album, “On the 6.”\nThanks to Combs, she spent 14 hours in December 1999 handcuffed at a Midtown police precinct over a shooting he was busted for at Club New York.\nLopez and Combs split in 2000, and in September 2001, she married her backup dancer, Cris Judd. They parted ways nine months later.\n“You’re no longer a normal person,” Judd, now a choreographer, told Us Weekly in 2014 , describing the hell of celebrity marriage.\nThen, for 18 months starting in 2002, Bennifer reared its dual, tabloid-fabulous head.\nJ.Lo and actor-director Ben Affleck met on the set of the box-office bomb “Gigli” and became engaged in November 2002 with a massive, $850,000 pink diamond ring.\nBut J.Lo hated Affleck’s gambling. And Affleck hated the harsh limelight.\nMeanwhile, everyone else hated Bennifer, especially after the couple’s cringe-worthy 2003 “Dateline” TV interview, in which she claimed to wash the couple’s dishes because “Ben wears the pants.”\nBy January, 2004, the two called off the wedding and split.\n“It felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest,” J.Lo later said.\nBut not for long.\nJennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony in 2016 WireImage By year’s end, J.Lo had reconnected with Anthony, who was himself freshly divorced from his former Miss Universe wife, Dayanara Torres .\nThe Latino power couple married secretly in June 2004, then went public spectacularly — singing a loving duet during the 2005 Grammy Awards.\nMarc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez and their kids, Max and Emme, on stage in 2009. WireImage The pair welcomed twins, a boy and a girl, in February 2008 and performed together on TV’s “ American Idol ,” for which J.Lo was a judge and Anthony a mentor.\nFor once, it seemed Lopez had finally found peace in her love life.\nThen, she and Anthony announced they were splitting in July 2011, and she was soon spotted keeping company with another of her backup dancers, Casper Smart . He was only 24 at the time, while Lopez was nearly twice his age.\nShe finalized her divorce with Anthony in June 2014, and later that year was spotted publicly flirting with yet another dancer, Maksim Chmerkovskiy of TV’s “ Dancing with the Stars .”\nFinally, briefly, there was Drake . The rapper, 30, gave her a $100,000 diamond necklace from Tiffany’s on New Year’s. Lopez, who currently stars in TV’s “Shades of Blue,’’ has since denied they were a couple .\nAs for A-Rod, his love life has been nearly as legendary as his time at bat.\nBefore J.Lo, the 41-year-old former Yankees superstar slugger had a long history of batting 1.000 with an enviable roster of beauties.\nHis wife of six years, Cynthia, was famously stomping on a Stairmaster in a Florida gym when the then-Seattle Mariner first set eyes on her.\nHe married the sexy schoolteacher in November 2002. The pair divorced in September 2008.\nRumor has it that while still married to Cynthia, he missed their second daughter’s birth by 10 minutes, then stayed at her bedside just 15 minutes more before heading back to New York — and side dish Madonna .\nIn 2007, The Post reported that A-Rod was also stepping out on Cynthia with a stripper and Playboy Bunny wannabe, Joslyn Noel Morse.\nIn 2009, after his divorce, he was briefly linked to Bethenny Frankel .\nCameron Diaz and Alex Rodriguez Getty Images The hits kept coming: model Elaine Spottswood, actress Cameron Diaz — caught on a much-ridiculed video feeding A-Rod popcorn at the 2011 Super Bowl — and, for three years, buff former WWE diva Torrie Wilson .\nHe also had been linked to actress Kate Hudson .\nOne of his former lovers said he is known to be quite proud of himself in the bedroom.\nHe keeps two paintings of himself — portrayed as a mythical half-man half-horse centaur — including one that has hung over his bed, the ex told US Weekly in 2009 .\nA-Rod, who last year retired from baseball, dated Wojcicki for a year before being smitten by J.Lo.\nBut given that his romantic past is as topsy-turvy as J.Lo’s, while she is “excited’’ about their relationship, she’s “cautious,’’ too, a source told People magazine .\n“For now, it’s just fun. She is single and enjoys dating,’’ the source said.\nRelated Video 1:02 J.Lo adds A-Rod to her list of famous beaus   WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:35:42.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
