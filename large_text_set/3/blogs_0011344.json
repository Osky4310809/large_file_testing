The campaign helps women financially so they can continue their pregnancies and give birth to their daughters. \n“Because of son preference, second daughters will remain at risk – so our Save a Girl Campaign remains important,” Littlejohn told Breitbart News. “We cannot give up the fight for the women and families of China, until every woman is free from the threat of coercion and every baby girl is free from the threat of sex-selection abortion or abandonment.” \nLittlejohn said that, according to 2015 State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices released in 2016, the estimated number of abortions in a year has increased from 13 to 23 million a year. \nIn the past, the Chinese government reported 13 million abortions a year, but the State Department said the number of abortions is higher because the government only uses registered medical clinics for its statistics and many abortions take place in unregistered medical clinics. \n“A coercive birth-limitation policy that, despite the lifting of one-child-per-family restrictions, in some cases resulted in forced abortion (sometimes at advanced stages of pregnancy),” the State Department report states.
