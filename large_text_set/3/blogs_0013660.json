It is certain to be a very good game of football. \n\"I learned a lot with Carlo, he is a good person and we all know what he did here and I think both teams have a 50-50 chance of qualifying. It will be special. \n\"We know each other very well but in a game like this, anything can happen. The important thing is not the draw. It is the attitude.\" \nBefore Zidane can worry about preparing for the Champions League though, his side face a difficult trip to San Mames and Athletic Club and he isn't expecting a routine away fixture as his side aim to extend their lead atop LaLiga. \n\"The only team who have beaten them at home was Barcelona and we know that this game is going to be a harder one than normal,\" continued Zidane. \n\"It is a very tough place to play but we are going to try and score as always. \n\"I don't know if winning games like these are important for the title as they are simply the same three very important points you get in any game but we must defend well, work hard and show confidence and personality. \n\"If we put all of these ingredients together then we can come out on top.\"\".
