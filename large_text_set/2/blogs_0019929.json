We'd Really Like Them To Come Up With Original Ones Now, Please Print Japleen Kaur Share   \nLast month, we got some news that WhatsApp is testing out a new feature in Ireland and guess what, it’s now available to users all over the world. \nIt is a feature that we’ve have been using for a while now — precisely three years. WhatsApp has introduced an update that has clearly been ripped off Snapchat. We can now put up a ‘story’ next to the status, which will disappear after 24 hours. Just like Snapchat stories, you can put images, videos, statuses, etc., and converse in a more interactive way with your contacts. Clearly, we really, really don’t need multiple apps now. \nThe feature was rolled out yesterday and founder, Jon Koum announced it on the blog , just shy of the app’s 8th birthday, which is on February 24, 2017. \nOnce the story is up, you can directly reply to it using the reply icon. The camera opens in a separate tab, allowing you to post a story without disturbing other messages. This is certainly a big step for the app, since everyone and your cousin’s girlfriend uses the app and it is one of the core reasons we buy smartphones. What it means for other apps is the real question, but honestly, where has the originality gone?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:45:19.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
