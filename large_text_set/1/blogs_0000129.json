But she reportedly told his father that she did not urinate on herself. \nThe father, Asuquo, decided to examine her and discovered that the girl’s private part was discharging substance. \nEkpeyong said: “Asuquo started probing her and threatening her. That was when she opened up and told him that it was Uncle Udeme who raped her. \n“Because of the New Year celebration, Udeme was still outside. The suspect and Asuquo were roommates. So they waited for him to come back. \n“On sighting Udeme, some of Asuquo’s friends pounced on him and started beating him. They gave him a beating of his life.” \n\n‘I leave him to God’ \nWhen Vanguard visited Asuquo, who was very emotional about what happened, he expressed shock over what his friend Udeme did to his daughter even after sheltering him for close to a year. \nIn his words: “Udeme is my very good friend. I took him in when he was dismissed from the bakery across the road, because they accused him of always stealing their bread. \n“He does not have relatives here and the ones he has do not even want to see him anymore because of his attitude. What he has done to my girl is despicable, and I know God will judge him because I do not want to arrest him, neither am I going to push the matter. \n“I am crying because he has damaged my baby’s life. She told me he has done it four times. That is most painful. \n“She was defiled in 2014. Why are they doing this to my little girl all the time? And they are all people I know.” \nThe victim’s father further told Vanguard that although the girl’s mother left them when things got a bit tough for him after he lost his father, he had no option than to take his daughter back to her mother to ensure she gets all the care she needs. \nHe said: “I have called to tell the mother what happened. She would be here any moment to pick her so that she would take care of her till they can go to the hospital on Monday. I have also told them to leave the idiot before they say I killed somebody this 2017.” \nA neighbour, who pleaded anonymity, corroborated what the victim’s father had earlier said about how the child was defiled, when she was about four years old, by a co-tenant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T07:49:19.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
