Most Popular By Luke O'Neil Mar 16, 2017 There's little doubt that President Donald Trump's budget blueprint is a a vicious hatchet job that seems almost comically directed at trimming the fat from the already emaciated programs that provide crucial health and human services. But one item, amidst other proposed cuts to the likes of the EPA and the State Department, has quickly metastasized as an outsized talking point among Democrats and critics online: Donald Trump is so heartless he even plans to eliminate Meals on Wheels! Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Meals on Wheels, the national program that delivers food door-to-door to needy and homebound seniors, is exactly the type of service it's easy to imagine the president scraping off the bottom of his shoe with a gold-plated cane. So it's easy to see why something like this would be hard to pass up from a politics standpoint; the DNC leaned on it in an email today, writing, \"Donald Trump is cutting Meals on Wheels, a program that delivers meals to senior citizens in need, to pay for his border wall.\" Most Popular In truth, it's more complicated than that. There's actually no mention of the service in the budget outline whatsoever. Instead, what the budget does—and which is actually orders of magnitude worse—is propose eliminating funding to the Community Development Block Grant program, a fund that has spent some $150 billion since 1974 in helping state and local governments fund affordable housing, parks, and the well-being of their most needy citizens. Unsurprisingly, Republicans tend to disagree on the efficacy of these types of programs since they tend not to be run by the troops or heroic policemen. How this will all play out for the implementation of Meals on Wheels remains to be seen, says spokeswoman Jenny Bertolette, but there's concern that their already precarious funding could get worse in the future. Currently only about 3 percent of the funding for the running of national association resource center of Meals on Wheels comes from federal funds, while 35 percent of the funds on a state level come from the Older Americans Act . The rest is made up by local and private foundation donations. While it's not their primary source of funds, there are nonetheless local Meals on Wheels programs that rely heavily on federal funding. Getty One thing that does seem clear is that funding for the Department of Health and Human Services is set to decrease by 17.9 percent overall , which means cuts to the Older Americans Act could be seen as well. \"If they're getting a substantial cut, one can assume or think that those cuts will trickle down through the programs and that could end up hurting Meals on Wheels even more than the block grant,\" Bertolette says. Asked about the cuts in a press conference on Thursday, Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney said they're necessary because CBG programs are \"just not showing any results.\" \"We can't spend money on programs just because they sound good,\" he said. \"And great, Meals on Wheels sounds great, but that's a state decision to fund that particular portion. But to take federal money and give it to the states and say, 'Look we want to give you to programs that don't work,' I can't defend that anymore…. We're not going to spend [money] on programs that cannot show they actually deliver the promises they've made to people.\" A look into the impact of home-delivered meal programs in 2013 found that in six out of eight such studies they \"significantly improve diet quality, increase nutrient intakes, and reduce food insecurity and nutritional risk among participants. Other beneficial outcomes include increased socialization opportunities, improvement in dietary adherence, and higher quality of life.\" Any decrease in spending, wherever it ends up coming from, will have significant consequences either way. Currently 2.4 million seniors receive Meals on Wheels services annually. While most chapters operate differently, that typically means delivery 5 days a week of two hot meals and one cold. On top of the nutritional factor, the contact with the volunteers serves as a crucial well-being check for many of the seniors as well, in the form of safety checks, and to make sure seniors are otherwise OK. Mick Mulvaney at the White House Press Briefing Thursday. Getty \"Our volunteers a lot of times are the only person that a homebound senior will see in an entire day,\" Bertolette says. \"It does a lot keeping seniors connected to communities making sure they're not forgotten.\" The effects of isolation on seniors' health can often be just as damaging as malnutrition. On top of that, as Meals on Wheels says, it will actually end up costing taxpayers more money if they do see drastic cutbacks. \"That whole package keeps seniors out of higher-cost alternatives like nursing homes and hospitals, and that ends up saving money on health care costs for tax payers, keeping seniors home and healthy instead of in hospitals,\" Bertolette says. \"If the seniors are better off, the country is better off, and the health care system that's already over-burdened is better off.\" The cost of feeding a senior for an entire year, the group estimates, is roughly the cost of a one day stay in the hospital. \"It's pretty staggering what we can do with a little bit of money.\" Prospective cuts notwithstanding, the program is already suffering, serving 23 million fewer meals a year than they did in 2005. There's a reason you may have seen such an uproar over the mere prospect of further cuts online today, then. Feeding needy seniors isn't—or at least, shouldn't—be a partisan issue. \"We receive support from both sides of the aisle,\" Bertolette says. \"We see it as a non-partisan issue. It just makes so much sense, fiscally, and morally.\" Related Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:39:51.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
