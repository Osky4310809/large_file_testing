Hull is, unusually, the focus of national attention in its year as UK City of Culture and this weekend will unveil a massive installation in the city centre. \nLate into the night a group of artists and engineers hidden in a row of Portakabins carried out the final tests in a secret plan to bring a 75-metre propeller blade designed for an offshore wind turbine into the middle of the city. \nThe object was due to be placed on its side – cutting across Queen Victoria Square – in the early hours, after slowly being transported from the new Siemens plant east of the city, where it was built by a team whose members were sworn to silence. If the wind blows too hard, they will try again next weekend. \n“This will be a huge intervention in a public space, probably the biggest ever,” Nayan Kulkarni, the artist behind the project, told the Observer . “It is partly about what this new industry means for Hull , but the challenge of just showing it can be done is a big part of it, too.” \nYesterday afternoon many citizens of Hull said a sorrowful goodbye to the Made in Hull light and sound show, the public art display that launched the city’s new cultural dawn. An estimated 230,000 visitors came to watch the projected lights and see the art installations dotted around the streets. Most restaurants, from cafes to expensive bistros, were fully booked. Long queues coiled outside the best chip shops. \n“This is fantastic. It’s already had an incredible impact. This is my fourth time round,” said Matt Jukes, the city council’s chief executive, when he spotted Made in Hull’s curator, the film-maker Sean McAllister, on Friday night. “You have set a very high bar.” \n“So, where do we go from here?” joked McAllister. \nIf the engineers’ calculations paid off, Hull residents woke up today to something more astonishing. The fibreglass rotor blade, the biggest single manmade component in the world and one of the first produced at the Alexandra Dock factory, will have transformed the square where, hours earlier, thousands crowded to watch the last night of animated illuminations by artist Zsolt Balogh. \nBalogh’s dramatic displays were projected on to the walls of the Guildhall and surrounding buildings and his soundtrack featured, among others, the voice of Fine Young Cannibals lead singer Roland Gift, who lived in Hull as a teenager. Listening to the music nearby on Friday was his sister, artist Helga Gift, who created one of the pop-up installations – a replica of a well-known vintage shop their late mother, Pauline, once ran on the city’s Princes Avenue. \n“She died exactly five years from the day we set up this installation about her,” she said. “It has been good to overhear people remembering the shop.” \nSuch local characters, rather than the city’s famous names, were the focus of Made in Hull, although the images of homegrown stars appeared in the light show; singer Tracey Thorn’s picture swam up in the vapour trail of the biplane of pioneer aviator Amy Johnson. The great men of Hull, from poet Philip Larkin, whose statue has him skipping through the station forecourt, to the abolitionist MP William Wilberforce, are also to be honoured, but there is also an effort to tell a wider cultural story. \n“Hull has its own voice,” said Martin Green, artistic director of the culture year. “It is maritime, it is about music, about counterculture, and about the renaissance of the city.” \n“Say what you like, this is our place,” said a spectator on Friday, defending Hull from the archetypal “crap town” label stuck on it in 2003 by the Idler magazine. Yet the slur has become the city’s best PR angle. Would it have been news if Bath or Harrogate were dubbed a city of culture? It is news, though, when the chosen city is notorious for having been blighted by the Blitz and then by post-industrial joblessness. \nTwo artists, Claire Morgan and Tania Kovats, will be making pieces that underline the city’s maritime history. In the 19th century, Hull’s whaling ships accounted for 40% of the British fleet. The trade died away and, after the cod wars of the 1970s and the containerisation of the docks, around 15,000 fishing jobs disappeared. Morgan aims to bring a vast, suspended, upside-down whale shape to the interior of Princes Quay shopping centre, while Kovats will highlight the threat to the marine environment with a piece at the soon to open Humber Gallery. \nPreparations for the year have meant upheaval, with widescale repaving and improvements to public spaces. The work has disguised the sly removal of lighting and street furniture to provide space for the delivery of the turbine blade. No one noticed. \nKulkarni has been involved with improving the look of Hull since 2013 and was in the city when Siemens, the German electronics and engineering conglomerate, signed up to develop Green Port Hull, investing £310m. \nHis idea to use a blade to emphasise the city’s geographical edge was inspired by Larkin, who wrote that Hull was “in the world, yet sufficiently on the edge of it to have a different resonance”. \nTo Kulkarni, the blade looks, from different angles, like a fish and a bone. He said he saw his artistic job as “to resist the push towards the empty icon”, instead creating art that stands for something. “In the square, it will break the natural ‘desire line’ for pedestrians and will be high enough at the tip for buses to pass underneath. It should be difficult to deal with.” \nAndrew Knight, co-curating the project, called Look Up, worked on the logistics of bringing in this “abnormal load” and said that “holding it down is the issue”. The blade, said Kulkarni, “wants to fly”, so the wind factor is important. \nFor resident Lucy Marshall, 39, the arrival of the City of Culture is a long- overdue recognition of Hull’s art and culture scene. “It didn’t just start on 1 January. We just haven’t been given a platform to show it before,” she said. “It is almost overwhelming. People are coming away quite emotional and inspired. There is a sense that this is what we do in Hull: we support each other. We are Hull and we are proud.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T06:06:56.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
