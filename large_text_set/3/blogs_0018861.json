He had been taken to The Children’s University Hospital, Temple Street, Dublin. \nCircuit Court President Mr Justice Raymond Groarke heard that X-rays revealed a fracture in Jamie’s arm and that he had to undergo surgery under anaesthetic. He had been discharged home the next day. \nThrough his mother Brenda Lagan, of Terramount, Rathcormac, Co Cork, Jamie sued Paximol Ltd, which trades as Carlton Hotel Blanchardstown, of Parkway House, Old Airport Road, Cloghran, Co Dublin. \nJamie’s legal team claimed the hotel had failed to ensure he would be safe in the bedroom as the bed constituted a danger and a trap. It was alleged the hotel had failed to take any effective measures to fix the bed in a more stable manner. \nThrough his mother Jamie also claimed the hotel had failed to take effective measures to prevent him from falling and had failed to provide a bed configuration in the bedroom without the need to push two divans together. \nMr Shorten, who appeared with Carl O’Mahony Solicitors, said the defendant had made an €21,500 settlement offer and, recommending acceptance of it, he said liability might have been made an issue in the case if it proceeded to a full trial. \nJudge Groarke approved the offer. He was told that Jamie’s injury had left a small scar on his elbow.
