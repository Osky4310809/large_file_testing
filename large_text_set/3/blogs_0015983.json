Michael Bennet to decide whether he will support his fellow Coloradan for the Supreme Court. \nFor weeks, Bennet has said little about Gorsuch — a reflection of Bennet’s own cautious style as well as a lack of consensus among Senate Democrats on how to respond to the high-court pick of President Donald Trump. \nBut with Gorsuch scheduled to appear this week before the Judiciary Committee for several days of hearings, liberal groups have pressed the Colorado Democrat to oppose Gorsuch even as Republicans and members of the state’s political elite have urged support. \nThe lobbying campaign has hit every medium. \nThe Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group, recently targeted Bennet with a $500,000 television advertising campaign warning of Senate “gridlock” over Gorsuch. \nOther activists — including those for veterans’ rights, LGBTQ rights and abortion rights — have made thousands of phone calls in Colorado over his nomination. \nAnd last week, former Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat, co-signed a letter in support of Gorsuch, a judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. \n“It is time to rise above the political fray, and for both sides of the aisle to commit to the high road going forward,” wrote Ritter, along with John Suthers, a Republican and former Colorado attorney general. \nA slice of that pressure was on display Thursday when Bennet faced questions about the Supreme Court nominee during a town hall meeting in Colorado Springs. \nAsked about his intentions, Bennet said he was withholding his decision until after the confirmation hearings are complete — a posture similar to his stance on Judge Merrick Garland, whose nomination last year by then-President Barack Obama was blocked by Republicans. \nGorsuch has “been a judge here for a long time and many, many people speak highly of him,” Bennet said. \nBut he added it was critical the Senate take the time to examine his judicial record and hear from Gorsuch publicly. “I think it’s very important to hear his testimony,” Bennet said. \nHis staff confirmed Friday that Bennet would introduce Gorsuch when he appears before the committee — joining U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. — but that the move should not be perceived as an endorsement. It’s tradition for senators to present judicial nominees from their home states. \nA key issue for Bennet is how Gorsuch would approach campaign finance law in light of Citizens United vs. FEC, the 2010 decision that helped open the floodgates for outside spending in political campaigns. \n“I spent more time with them on Citizens United than I did on anything else,” said Bennet, a critic of that Supreme Court ruling. \nHe did not elaborate on what Gorsuch or his people told him. \nBennet has come under extra scrutiny because of his place in the Senate and his political record in Colorado. \nAs it stands, Republicans control 52 of 100 seats in the upper chamber — enough to confirm Gorsuch with a majority vote but not enough to clear the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. \nThat gives Republicans two options. They can change Senate rules and bypass the filibuster, which could hurt them politically but put them a clear path to confirmation.
