Father Abel Abulu, in the creek. \nThose who renounced cultism reportedly s Jesus on the cross \nurrendered different kinds of weapons to the clergyman in charge of St. Patrick Catholic Church, Bodo, and Gokana Peace Ambassadors, GPA. \nRecall that several attempts by the Rivers State amnesty committee, led by Mr. Ken Chinda, to grant amnesty to cultists in the area proved abortive, as the boys had refused to release guns, claiming that they do not operate with guns. \nAfter the youths declined the state’s amnesty programme in two separate events, the GPA took up intervention measures to restore peace in the area based on the rise in the spate of violence and other criminal activities. \nVanguard learned that the cleric and members of GPA went into the creeks to preach peace to the cultists. \nDenbesi Isaac, one of the repentant cultists, said they were tired of living in the bush and called on the state government to join efforts with the Christian community and the GPA to ensure adequate empowerment of the boys. \nIsaac said: “We thank God that we are alive today. It was the Rev. Father’s preaching that made us to change our minds. \n“To me it is the handiwork of God. \n“We are calling on the state government to include us in their amnesty programme. They should train and empower us so that we would not think of going back to our past lives.” \nThe President of GPA, Kpakol Aleema-Kpakol, said the group decided to embark on peace move because of wide spread of violence which has claimed several lives. \nHe thanked Abulu for his commitment in the peace process and urged the state government to include the repentant cultists in the amnesty programme in the interest of peace and development.
