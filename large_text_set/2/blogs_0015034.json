Today, with the show in the middle of its collegiate tournament, Jeopardy! decided to dip into that crowd-pleaser well with a category called “Let’s Rap Kids!” that required the contestants to name popular rap artists when given only the lyrics to one of their songs. Naturally, that meant host Alex Trebek had to recite some rap lyrics, which is always very funny. \nPitchfork collected some video clips from the show that feature lines from Kanye West’s “Famous,” Desiigner’s “Panda,” and Drake’s “Started From The Bottom,” and you can see a few below: There's a rap category on Jeopardy, and Alex Trebek's got BARS. pic.twitter.com/W5NGCBREdf — Justin Ferguson (@JFergusonAU) February 21, 2017 Here's Alex Trebek rapping on @Jeopardy for those of you not watching 😂 pic.twitter.com/FANczhVSl7", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:56:18.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
