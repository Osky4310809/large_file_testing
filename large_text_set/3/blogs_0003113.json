Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding their comments on meetings with Russian ambassadors. \nAs you may recall, McCaskill took to Twitter earlier today to hammer Sessions over his comments at his confirmation hearing regarding communications with Russia, following a report stating that he had met with the Russian ambassador twice during the election campaign. However, it was soon discovered that despite McCaskill saying she hadn’t met with a Russian ambassador in ten years, she had actually tweeted in the past about her meetings with the envoy. (She’d later say the meeting was actually a conference about adoption.) \nSpeaking to Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), Burnett brought this up and wondered if Democrats issues with Sessions over his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were just partisan. \n“When you say I don’t believe the Attorney General of the United States, you believe he’s not telling the truth,” Burnett noted. “I have to ask you about this, though. It’s important to understand whether this is partisan.” \nAfter recapping the situation with McCaskill, she then asked Gutierrez, “How is that different than Sessions who said he didn’t bring it up because it was about Ukraine?” \nGutierrez would state that the difference was due to Sessions taking an oath at the confirmation hearing. \n“Aren’t each of these things a lie?” Burnett asked. “One is a lie. The other is a lie.” \nwatch the clip above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T04:40:32.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
