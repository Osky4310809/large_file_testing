Jones pulled up gimpy earlier in the second half, but stayed in the game. He was then absent as Atlanta worked to kill the clock. FOX's Pam Oliver deemed it precautionary, but it's a huge storyline to watch ahead of next Sunday's NFC Championship Game. The Falcons' offense is a well-oiled machine, but missing Jones could easily be the difference between making the Super Bowl or missing it. Jan 14 - 7:35 PM Source: Vaughn McClure on Twitter Julio Jones (toe) is practicing fully for the Divisional Round. Jones should be close to 100 percent coming off Atlanta's bye. He doesn't have a great matchup but is still a strong DFS play. Jones had a 7/139/1 line against Seattle back in Week 6. Jan 11 - 5:14 PM Julio Jones caught 7-of-9 targets for 96 yards and one touchdown in the Falcons' Week 17 win over the Saints. A week after playing just 39-of-63 snaps in his return from a toe sprain, Jones played 49-of-62 snaps in this one. His touchdown was a tremendous one-yarder in the back left corner of the end zone with a beautiful toe-tap at the end of it. Jones looks healthy heading into the playoffs and will get a first-round bye to get even closer to 100 percent. Look out for this offense. Jan 1 - 9:08 PM Falcons coach Dan Quinn indicated Julio Jones (toe) will not be on a snap count in Week 17 against the Saints. \"He looked good over the last couple of days, so I'm not going to monitor him,\" said Quinn. \"If it gets sore, then we'll take him out. He looked good in practice today. He looked strong. He looked explosive.\" Julio's floor isn't necessarily safe, but he is an enticing tournament option in DFS this week. Taylor Gabriel (foot) isn't playing, opening up a few additional touches for the rest of the offense. Julio should have a much bigger role than last week.
