Getty Images Ibrahimovic’s contract expires at the end of the season at Old Trafford EPA Fernando Torres’ spell at Atletico Madrid could be coming to an end Getty Images The former Liverpool striker is not first-choice for Diego Simeone’s side Fernando Torres \nAt 32, ex- Liverpool striker Fernando Torres is no longer a guaranteed starter for Atletico Madrid, with summer signing Kevin Gameiro more regularly preferred to partner Antoine Griezmann in attack. \nThe World Cup-winner will be out of contract in June and, although be best days are behind him and he lacks yard of pace compared to his Anfield pomp, Torres still very much knows where the net is, and could improve many sides’ firepower. \nWhether he remains in Spain or looks to seek regular football elsewhere, a player of Torres’ ability could be an interesting option for some of Europe’s top clubs. Getty Images Pepe on a free would be a bargain for any side in Europe Getty Images The 34-year-old’s time at Madrid could end this summer Pepe \nThe Portuguese centre-back was outstanding in helping his country secure their first major honour last summer at the European Championships. \nA stalwart of the Real Madrid backline since moving to the Spanish capital from Porto in 2007, Pepe could be set to leave the 11-time champions of Europe when his contract expires at the end of the season. \nWith his blend of experience and technical ability, the 34-year-old could offer a short-term fix for any top club looking to patch up a shaky defence. \nHowever, a move to the cash-rich Chinese Super League looks like being Pepe’s most likely option as things stand. Weekend Round-Up : Watch the best action from the Premier League Thiago Motta \nBrazil-born Italy international Thiago Motta looks set to end his five-year stint at Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the current campaign. \nThe former Barcelona and Inter Milan midfielder is a two-time Champions League winner with title-winning league campaigns under his belt in three different countries. \nAt 34, Motta is not as mobile as he once was, but he remains an excellent passer capable of orchestrating play from the base of midfield. Getty Images Former Chelsea star Salomon Kalou is another summer freebie Getty Images The Hertha Berlin ace has bagged 29 goals in 81 matches Salomon Kalou \nHe never quite cracked the Chelsea first-team on a regular basis during his six years at Stamford Bridge, but Salomon Kalou has developed into one of the most effective forwards in the Bundesliga with Hertha Berlin. \nAfter two seasons in Ligue 1 with Lille, in which he scored an impressive 34 goals and registered 11 assists in 79 appearances, the Ivory Coast international moved to Germany’s capital. \nThe 31-year-old has found the net 29 times in 81 games for Hertha, usually operating on the left side of their attack and cutting inside onto his stronger right foot. \nStill in his early 30s, Kalou has plenty of top level football left in the tank, and would be an astute signing for any club. Getty Images Keisuke Honda is almost certain to leave AC Milan at the end of the season Getty Images Honda has won 82 caps for Japan but has only played six times for Milan this year Keisuke Honda \nTalented Japanese attacking midfielder Keisuke Honda is almost certain to leave AC Milan this summer, with little prospect of the Rossoneri offering the 30-year-old a new contract at the San Siro. \nWith 82 international caps to his name, not to mention 36 goals for Japan, the versatile former CSKA Moscow star has top level experience, and his ability to play on either flank or centrally as a No.10 could make him a valuable asset for many clubs. Getty Images 11 Vincenzo Montella does not appear to be a fan of the Japan star \nAfter featuring regularly for Milan in his first two season with the club, Honda has fallen down the pecking order under Vincenzo Montella this term, having appeared just six times in all competitions. \nHowever, if any Premier League club hopes to snap Honda up, they’ll have to get motoring as Major League Soccer’s Seattle Sounders are reportedly very close to securing his services. Some of the best Premier League goals of the month for February Taison \nAlthough not out of contract until December, one-time Chelsea target Taison could be a solid pick-up for a lot of teams. \nThe Brazilian playmaker has been at Shakhtar Donetsk since 2013 and has won two Ukrainian titles. \nThe diminutive two-cap Selecao international is capable of playing centrally or on either wing with the creativity and an eye for goal that could see him succeed in one of Europe’s major leagues. \nHe may not quite have the calibre to come straight into the starting XI of any of the Continent’s biggest sides, but Taison could be a useful squad option for a high-ranking team, or an ambitious signing for a club looking to rise up the table.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:53:33.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
