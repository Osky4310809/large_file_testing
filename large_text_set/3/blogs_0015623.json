Y’all don’t know what I’ve been through, watching Key & Peele do my show the last five fucking years.”\nThis thinly-veiled jab by Chappelle was perceived by many as sour grapes, a paranoid cheap shot by a comedy ledgend at a couple of up-and-coming dudes succeeding in the sketch comedy realm.\nChappelle recently addressed his salt toward Key & Peele to CBS This Morning ‘s Gayle King, claiming that he’s a fan of the now discontinued show and his gripe was over the show’s “conventions.”\n“when I did Chappelle’s Show , there were certain conventions of the show that the network resisted. And I fought the network very hard so that those conventions could come to fruition… So when I watch Key and Peele and I see they’re doing the format that I created and at the end of the show it says ‘created by Key and Peele,’ that hurts my feelings.”\nThe Key & Peele bit is at the 7:35 mark of the below interview, but if you’ve got time, check out the entire thing. Chappelle speaks on his reasons for turning down $50 million to keep making the Chappelle Show to jet to South Africa. A decade later, he’s set to make $60 million for three stand-up specials for Neflix,so all’s well that ends well.\n\n[h/t Uproxx ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:44:24.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
