AHCA Failure Pulls Down Trump Approval Rating \n“Ivanka’s service as an unpaid employee furthers our commitment to ethics, transparency, and compliance and affords her increased opportunities to lead initiatives driving real policy benefits for the American public that would not have been available to her previously,” the White House statement reads. \nDefining Ivanka Trump’s role is something critics of the president have been demanding. \nEarlier Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., wrote to the Office of Government Ethics, saying Trump’s “increasing, albeit unspecified, White House role … [has] resulted in substantial confusion .”   \n“We write today to request information about the ethics rules that President Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, will be required to comply with, or has indicated she will voluntarily comply with, in her role as an adviser to the president,” they wrote. \nSaturday, Rev. Al Sharpton said giving an office to Ivanka Trump, a family member with an unspecified role, is unheard of. \n“Giving an office on the West Wing of Ivanka Trump, somebody explain to me how you can give security clearance, access to classified material, and a office to somebody that don’t have a title or job?” Sharpton said. \nMuch of the first daughter’s presence so far has been unprecedented. In essence, the announcement formalizes the role she has already undertaken.
