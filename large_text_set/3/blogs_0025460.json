And yet they stay. \nBut why? Why do people stay in relationships long past their expiry dates? No one needs a boyfriend or girlfriend, after all. \nTo those of us who’ve never found ourselves in such a situation, it can seem like a bit of a mystery. Is it simply a fear of being alone? The five signs your relationship is over \nPeople have now been speaking out and explaining why they stick with their partners when they know it won’t last. \n“The love just faded away, not suddenly some sharp ping then ‘oh I don't love you anymore’,” one man wrote in a particularly moving post on the Reddit forum, \n“One day I am doing the dishes and I realised I was happy because she wasn't coming home tonight, working later again. I suspect she is seeing a work colleague, an old bf she still gets on with, they'd known each other for years before I came along. \n“The funny thing is I don't feel angry or hurt or betrayed. There is just a gentle relief that she is happy and I am happy without her. I always thought I needed a relationship but now as this one bleeds out on the floor I just feel content to watch it gasp and die.” \nSometimes it’s not that the relationship has turned completely toxic, it’s just not happy anymore, as the man pointed out. \nSomeone asked why he didn’t leave her, to which he responded: “Emotionally I fear it's like I've been slowly stabbed and if I pull at that knife everything is going to hurt so much.” \nIt’s a painful and powerful simile.
