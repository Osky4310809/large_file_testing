primary rival Ted Cruz. “She served as a strategist for Keep the Promise I, a pro-Cruz super-PAC bankrolled by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer that ran attack ads against Trump during the primary campaign, including one blasting the real estate mogul for supposedly supporting government-run healthcare,” said Mother Jones. \nThe Conways donated money to Ted Cruz’ campaign. \nHer company’s website says she has worked for a variety of Republican political figures, including, “late Congressman Jack Kemp; President Reagan’s pollster, Richard Wirthlin; Congressmen Marsha Blackburn, Lee Zeldin, Steve King; Vice President Dan Quayle; Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; Sens. Fred Thompson and Ted Cruz, and Gov. Mike Pence.” \nThe Review Journal says Conway has been criticized before for comments she made about women. “She caught flack for telling women to embrace femininity, not feminism, in a 2011 speech at the Conservative Women’s Network. She caught more in 2013 for advising a group of House Republicans to stop talking about rape,” the newspaper said. \nIn the latter incident, Former Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) had sparked controversy when he said a woman could terminate a pregnancy resulting from a “legitimate rape,” according to Politico . Soon after, Conway “dispensed the stern advice” that Republicans should avoid talking about rape in campaigns, calling it a “four-letter word,” according to Politico. \nPolitico said Conway made the comment “as part of a polling presentation she made alongside fellow GOP pollsters David Winston — an adviser to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) — and Dave Sackett. The comment was described by several sources in the room.” \nConway was Akin’s consultant and also created controversy when she compared him to cult leader David Koresh, said CNN. \nConway has also criticized Hillary Clinton over Bill Clinton’s extramarital relationships, saying, according to Rolling Stone :”The fact is that Hillary Clinton could not stand up to a cheating husband, so how in the world would she stand up to North Korea and some of our other enemies around the globe?” In 2004, Conway said on CNN that Clinton “wasn’t popular until her husband treated her like a doormat,” Rolling Stone said. 4. She Is a Lawyer Who Was Tapped by the RNC to Counter the ‘War on Women’ but Has Criticized Feminism . @KellyannePolls on @HillaryClinton : \"She's the second most popular person in a two-person household.\" #KellyFile pic.twitter.com/Y2kKDQOYMm \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) August 17, 2016 \nConway’s company bio says “the RNC tasked Kellyanne with helping to defeat the so-called ‘War on Women.’” One division of her polling company, WomanTrend, tracks “the social, cultural, financial, professional and health trends influencing—and being influenced by—women,” the company website says . The Review Journal says she was hired to fix Trump’s image with women by urging him to show more compassion and not insult their looks. \nHer company biography call s her a “fully-recovered” attorney, and says she is admitted to practice law in four jurisdictions (Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia). “She has practiced law, clerked for a judge in Washington, DC and for four years, was an adjunct professor at George Washington University Law Center,” says the bio. \nShe earned a B.A. in political science from Trinity College, Washington, D.C., studied at Oxford University, and earned her law degree, with honors, from George Washington University Law Center, the bio says. \nConway’s views on feminism were discussed in an Atlantic magazine article on conservative women’s views on feminism. In that article, she said, conservatives want women “to see that there’s even an alternative to the progressive, liberal orthodoxy that has every woman constantly thinking about abortion, contraception, being a victim of the patriarchy” and said conservatives present “an alternative of fun, engaging accomplished women.” 5. Conway Now Has a Top Position as Counselor to the President & Was Dubbed the ‘Trump Whisperer’ Paul Manafort speaks with former presidential candidate Ben Carson before a Trump event. (Getty) \nConway has been one of Trump’s highest-profile surrogates in the news media, and, with others, she helped engineer his surprise victory. \nIn a story announcing that Conway has been named counselor to the president by Trump, The New York Times labeled her the “Trump Whisperer.” \nThat slot makes her the highest-ranking female in Trump’s administration, said The Times. \nAccording to CNN , Conway “will work with White House senior leadership on messaging and to help execute the administration’s legislative priorities.” Jessica McBride is a Heavy contributor.
