Oscar Pareja's team would have been on the board early if it weren't for a string of saves from Miguel Lloyd during a 10th-minute barrage from the hosts. \nRoland Lamah then found the back of the net in the 15th minute after Max Urruti sprung him in the penalty area, but the goal was ruled out for offside. \nAnd Dallas finally scored their opener in the 29th minute, when Cristian Colman won a footrace to a through ball behind the Arabe Unido defense and smashed a first-time volley past Lloyd. \nColman almost doubled his tally early in the second half after getting on the end of a pass over the top of the Arabe Unido defense, but his heavy first touch gave Lloyd just enough time to smother the ensuing shot attempt. \nBut the second goal for Dallas would come just minutes later. After some neat build-up play, Lamah set up Kellyn Acosta at the top of the penalty area and he blasted a right-footed shot with his first touch to make it 2-0. \nDallas continued to press for a third, and it came in the 85th minute, Acosta settling a pass from Tesho Akindele at the top of the penalty area and firing an unstoppable right-footed shot past Lloyd. \nWith time running down, Dallas added a fourth on the counter-attack, as Akindele set up Michael Barrios to slot home past Lloyd and give the home team a nearly insurmountable cushion when the teams meet again for the second leg in Panama on March 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:27:01.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
