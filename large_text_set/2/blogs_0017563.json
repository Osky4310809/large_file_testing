And if you’re not one to hop on a bandwagon of any type, then more power to you! But this unicorn food craze is a hard trend to avoid. It’s just so pretty. And the most recent convert to the church of rainbows is Kristen Bell. Her unicorn-ified grilled cheese sandwich is making us drool rainbows and sparkles .\nThe coolest thing about Bell’s sandwich is the fact that she used natural food dyes to create the multicolored effect. She captioned her pic,\n“Red=beet juice. Purple=boiled purple cabbage juice. Blue=Boiled purple cabbage juice+baking soda. Rainbow Grilled Cheese=DELICIOUS.” A post shared by kristen bell (@kristenanniebell) on Feb 20, 2017 at 6:33pm PST \nWe’re wondering if Bell was inspired to make this creation by Rob on the ThreadBanger YouTube channel. We’re also wondering if Bell knew she could just get her colored cheeses from the Rainbow Cow Creamery. It seems like that option would have required a lot less work than having to dye her own cheeses.\nBut hey, to each their own, right? \n\n(Note: We are well aware that this is a spoof and that rainbow cows don’t ~actually~ exist. But just imagine if they did! That would be rad!)\nBut if you want to create a rainbow unicorn grilled cheese sandwich à la Kristen Bell, all you’ll need to do is separately mix your choice of food coloring into small helpings of shredded cheese. Line your different colored cheeses up on a piece of bread, throw another piece on top and toss the sandwich into a buttered frying pan.\nAnd then reap the magical rewards: After school snack, anyone? #rainbowgrilledcheese #sprinkles \nA post shared by It GiRL Magazine (@itgirl_mag) on Feb 20, 2017 at 9:20pm PST \nToday I made this Rainbow Grilled Cheese for the @buzzfeedtasty Instagram & now I have rainbow colored hands! #iaintmad #rainbowgrilledcheese \nA post shared by Alix Traeger (@majortraeger) on Oct 3, 2016 at 5:55pm PDT \n*We're closed today* Back tomorrow with the #rainbowgrilledcheese 11am-2pm \nA post shared by Grill My Cheese (@grill_my_cheese) on Oct 4, 2016 at 2:36am PDT \nLike we said, this is a trend that’s hard to avoid falling in love with. The proof is in the pudding — or rather, the cheddar.
