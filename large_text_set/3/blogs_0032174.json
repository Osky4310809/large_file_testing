George with lover Fadi George died three months ago (Photo: Getty) \nGreek radio host Vasilis Panayi, a family friend, said in February: “It’s very hard for all of them, quite intolerable. It’s a shock and terrible for his father… He wants to hold the funeral but so far the police are refusing to release the body and are looking for further clues.” \nAnd George's former Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley told The Mirror earlier this month that the family were hopeful they could bury George soon. \n\"We've not had closure,\" explained Andrew. \"It's difficult for me, it's difficult for everyone. It's a limbo period and we need to be able to move on.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:38:58.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
