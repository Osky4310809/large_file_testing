I find it hard to imagine a personality less suited by temperament and background to be the leader of the worldâ€™s foremost democracy.

Americans believe deeply in the legitimacy of their constitutional system, in large measure because its checks and balances were designed to provide safeguards against tyranny and the excessive concentration of executive power. But that system in many ways has never been challenged by a leader who sets out to undermine its existing norms and rules.
