The withdrawal technically has to be voted upon by the Hungary City Assembly, but there is no doubt that it will pass. \nBudapest was one of the last three contenders to the host the Games, along with Los Angeles and Paris. Last week an anti-Olympics group announced they had collected enough signatures to put withdrawing the bid up for a citywide referendum. Recent polling showed that a plurality of Budapest residents were against hosting the Olympics and its assorted costs, signaling the withdrawal referendum was likely to succeed.

Rome’s bid was opposed by the city’s major and other officials, citing the city and country’s financial woes, and it was eventually suspended. Hamburg’s bid was pulled after residents voted it down in a referendum . \nLos Angeles and Paris are both huge cities with the necessary infrastructure to host an event as massive as the Olympics, and already have basically all of the necessary venues for each sport. That doesn’t mean the IOC won’t force them to build new venues, or that they won’t have to spend massive amounts of money on security and law enforcement and feting IOC officials, but the total outlay should be dramatically less than what Athens, Beijing, and Rio de Janeiro have spent on recent Games.
