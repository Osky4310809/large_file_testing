You’ve seen it a million times, but have probably never paid it any attention. Because like so many other things in life, when you don’t know what something is used for, you just ignore it. Well that tiny diamond patch on backpacks that you thought was there for decoration actually has a purpose after all.\nMarie Claire has brought our attention to the intent of that little diamond-shaped patch you’ll find on many Jansport backpacks , and as it turns out, it’s not a pencil holder or a secure place to hold your strings as you make friendship bracelets . \nAlthough, TBH, it works for those things too.

You know, important stuff that you’d need access to immediately and can’t be bothered to rummage through your backpack to find. \nA photo posted by JanSport (@jansport) on Jan 19, 2017 at 5:48pm PST \nThings like a flashlight, extra shoes, a hat, a canteen (thirst can happen at any moment, you guys), a bandana, or a string of dental floss you might need later.

Probably not. But that doesn’t make the intent of it any less cool or fun to know about. So that tiny, weirdly placed patch isn’t so useless after all. Who woulda thought.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T04:43:25.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
