He never thought he’d get a chance to coax a chuckle out of TV legend Norman Lear. \nBut that unimagined dream came true when Nenninger was cast in Netflix’s reboot of “One Day at a Time,” streaming now. Lear, 94, who developed the original show in 1975, re-imagined it for Netflix with a contemporary spin, with Justina Machado as a Cuban-American nurse and single mom, and Rita Moreno as her own mother. \nNenninger, 38, plays Scott, a know-it-all nurse who works with Machado’s Penelope. The role is recurring, so he’s not in all of the 13 episodes, but the project gave him a chance to revisit a show he loved in reruns when he was a kid. \n“I auditioned with a tape I made myself,” Nenninger says. “I was going for the role of Schneider,” the handyman who is the only character who carries over by name in the reboot. “They were about to offer it to another guy, a friend of mine (Todd Grinnell), but a different part came along.” \nNenninger was sure the new role was just right for him. After executive producer Gloria Kellett watched his tape, he got a callback. With Lear. \n“It was in a little theater, not an office, and he was sitting there, watching me,” Nenninger recalls. “I did the scene and snapped right into it. It fit like a glove. Afterward, I went out in the parking lot and hyperventilated.” \nNenninger describes Scott as “an ex-jock, an arrogant loudmouth,” and if friends wouldn’t say that fits Nenninger, he certainly has the ex-jock looks and is in fact a former football player. \nHis first break in Hollywood was on Fox’s “Malcolm in the Middle,” as a military school friend of son Francis. Then, in 2008, he played a character nicknamed “Captain America” in the HBO miniseries “Generation Kill,” from David Simon (“The Wire”). \nA 1997 graduate of Ladue High School, Nenninger got his start in show business at Immacolata Elementary in Richmond Heights, where he once took a pie in the face in a preschool pageant. (“I was a ham.”) In high school, he got serious about acting and went on to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Los Angeles. \nThat’s where he met his wife, actress Angel Parker, last seen as a lawyer in “The People v. O.J. Simpson.” They met in acting school and now have two children, James and Naomi. \nBoth kids are being raised as Cardinals fans. “My son didn’t even know for a long time that there was another team,” Nenninger says. They also appreciate Ted Drewes frozen custard, thanks to visits to family here. \nThe family isn’t surprised that Nenninger wound up in a TV comedy. \n“I was a jokester growing up,” he says. “I was sarcastic, and that was valued in my family.” \nOne example: Nenninger’s mother, Joan Petralia, is known to carry a joke cockroach in her handbag. She and her husband, Larry, live in the house in Olivette where Eric grew up. His father, Joe Nenninger, lives in Cedar Hill with his wife, Barb. \nMaking a living as an actor isn’t all fun and games. Nenninger always says it’s not hard; it’s impossible. \nBut an experience like “One Day at a Time,” which got good reviews and could return for additional seasons, helped him realize why he does it. \n“I grew up on ‘All in the Family,’” he says of getting to work with Lear, that show’s creator. “My grandpa was Archie, with the armchair and the opinions.” \n“One Day at a Time” taped live, with a studio audience, and Lear was frequently on hand. “I got a compliment from him, and that’s something I’ll live on. Getting to do this was such a gift.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T09:16:16.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
