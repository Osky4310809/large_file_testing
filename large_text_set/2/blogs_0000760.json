The company’s team met government officials on January 25 to discuss iPhone manufacturing in the country. Last month, it was reported that Apple has selected Taiwanese OEM maker, Wistron as the primary iPhone manufacturer. Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said last month that India would consider Apple’s request for incentives to invest in the country with an “open mind.” \nIn last May, Apple had announced setting up a design and development accelerator in the city to grow the iOS developer community. Apple shipped record 2.5 million iPhone units in India during 2016.
