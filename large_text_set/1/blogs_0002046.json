IndiaToday.in | Edited by Ruchi Dua A + A - \nAfter the shameful Bengaluru incident, where several women were allegedly molested during New Year celebrations despite huge police presence, Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi today has made shocking comments by saying that it was bound to happen. \nThe Samajwadi Party leader said that men and women are different, and therefore women must not step out of their place at night. \nMeanwhile, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju condemned the shameful incident of mass molestation of women in the IT city. \"Unfortunate. HowÂ can such incidents happen? Strict action must be taken,\" Rijiju said. \nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: \"There should be strict action against those going against our culture\", Abu Azmi said. \"If a girl celebrates after dark she should go with her husband, father and not with strangers\", Azmi said. \"Women call nudity fashion\", the Samajwadi Party leader said. \"I accept that attraction happens between men and women but we need to take precautions\", he added. When asked about his views on women security in the nation, he said that Indian culture is changing and westernisation is a black spot on our culture. He also went on shaming women for embracing western culture and said that there should be strict action against those going against our culture. Girls were pawed, groped and abused by revellers in Bengaluru's MG Road and Brigade Road during New Year's Eve celebrations. All this happened despite the 1,500 policemen deployed in the area. Bengaluru top cop Praveen Sood told India Today that Karnataka Police will reach out to the victims and help them. Police will take help of 60 CCTV cameras installed in the area and try to identify the culprits.
