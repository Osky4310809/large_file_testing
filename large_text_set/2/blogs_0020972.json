That’s what makes this new announcement from NASA so exciting; they’ve made an exoplanet discovery worth its own press event .\nThe even better news—until we have the actual news that tomorrow’s event will bring—is that the content of tomorrow’s press conference is also set to appear in Nature , so it’s at least been subject to some amount of vetting in the peer review process. We all remember what happened with the press conference to announce the discovery of gravitational waves from the dawn of the Universe that then turned out not to be true, although separate gravitational waves have since been discovered … right?\nAnyway, this announcement is planned for tomorrow at 1PM EST (NASA TV stream embedded above), with curious viewers encouraged to ask questions on Twitter (#askNASA) and a Reddit AMA to follow at 3PM. It’s hard to say what they’ve discovered (though our minds always jump to aliens first and then dial back expectations from there), but things that would be a big deal are evidence of the chemical building blocks of life on exoplanets or some strong evidence of potential habitability, which is hard to judge at such great distances.\n(via Engadget , image via Hubble ESA on Flickr )\nWant more stories like this?
