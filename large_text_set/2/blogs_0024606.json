Gave no thought to Russian flag, they all said,” wrote Tim Alberta of Politico.

Clayton was escorted from the event. \n“If you’re waving them, you will be removed,” one guard told attendees. \nOne attendee from San Francisco said he wanted to keep the Trump flag as a souvenir, but lamented a perceived lack of humor on behalf of CPAC staffers. \nThe incident was not Clayton’s first outspoken act toward the president. In December, he claimed Moscow had hijacked the November election to help Trump.

The group is called Americans Take Action. \nAntics aside, CPAC amounted to a something of a victory lap for the Trump administration. Reince Priebus, Trump’s chief of staff, and Stephen K. Bannon, the White House chief strategist, made a joint appearance. \nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway was another component of the program, with her talk coming on the heels of criticisms she’d made of feminism, wherein she sought to redefine the movement . \nTrump highlighted his efforts to “massively lower taxes” and replace the Affordable Care Act, drawing cheers by calling it “the disaster known as Obamacare.” \nThe president also used CPAC as a show of force, touting his administration’s perceived successes thus far, including pulling out of a major trade deal, reducing regulations, cracking down on illegal immigrants and clearing the way for construction of major oil pipelines.
