But far fewer, 17 percent, think things will actually pan out that way. \nThe survey also found that 91 percent of Republicans and 73 percent of unaffiliated voters want the incoming commander in chief’s presidency to be a success, while 67 percent of Republicans actually believe Trump will succeed. \nA majority of Democrats, 52 percent, believe Trump is more likely to fail. And 26 percent of Democrats actually want the president-elect to fail. \nAmong voters who want Trump’s presidency to be a success, 53% say it’s likely to achieve that goal. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of voters who want Trump to fail believe he’s more likely to do so. \nMen want Trump to succeed more than women do and are more confident that he will. Middle-aged voters are slightly more skeptical about his chances of success than others are. \nBlacks think he is much less likely to succeed than whites and other minority voters. \nOnly 17% of voters who Strongly Approve of the job President Obama is doing believe Trump is more likely to be a success. Among voters who Strongly Disapprove of the current president’s job performance, 78% expect Trump to succeed. \nThe national telephone and online survey of likely voters was conducted January 3-4, 2017 and has a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:19:58.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
