It will also improve technology of farmers in planting,” Piñol said. \n“There were attempts to propagate soy bean in the country but these were never successful. With the initiative of CP, we will be able to develop a new crop which is a growing requirement for feeds,” he added.   \nWhile the CP Group is already present in the Philippines, particularly in Luzon, it plans to expand its operations to the Visayas and Mindanao where the threat of typhoons is less. \nAmong these areas include Palawan, Negros, Bohol, Bukidnon, Saranggani, Caraga, Maguindanao and North and South Cotabato. \nThis new investment pledge is expected to create 2,000 jobs. \nPiñol said a technical working group would be created to assist the investors. He is preparing the necessary documents and expects the memorandum of agreement to be signed by end-April.
