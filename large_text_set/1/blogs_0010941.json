These photos were provided by police. The one at left is the most recent. \nST. LOUIS • Police are searching for a missing St. Louis girl who left for her school bus stop early Wednesday and hasn’t been seen since. \nKameill Taylor, 12, left for the bus stop about 6:10 a.m. from her home in the 5300 block of Labadie Avenue, near Union Boulevard, police said. \nThe girl was to meet a friend and then walk to a bus stop a few blocks away at Maffitt Avenue and Union, her mother told police. \nBut Kameill never showed up at her friend’s house and never arrived at Carr Lane Middle School. Her mother said this is unusual behavior for Kameill. \n“She loved going to school,” said Shonta Taylor, 31. “She was bubbly and energetic. She was not wild or the kind of girl who would get in trouble.” \nShe was chosen student of the month for December, and her photo was taken there Monday to go along with the honor. \nTaylor and family members have been searching alleys, vacant houses and the route Kameill was to have walked to the bus stop. Police have been canvassing the area, Taylor said. \n“It’s like my baby vanished,” she said. \nKameill is about 5 feet 7 inches, 160 pounds and has medium-length braided hair. She was wearing black and purple Nike Air Jordan tennis shoes, black scrub-styel pants and a black polo shirt with a dark-colored plaid coat. She carried a bright colored plaid book bag. \nAuthorities asked anyone with information about Kameill’s whereabouts to call 911.
