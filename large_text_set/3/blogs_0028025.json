Judge Gregory rejected the denial. \nOn another occasion, Bryce was found to have allowed loud music to be played at her home for 'hours and hours, until 4.53 in the morning'. \nShe also allowed so much cannabis to be smoked in the home, that it caused a 'nuisance through smell' to the Tidmarshes next door. \nSpeaking in her own defence, Bryce claimed that some of the late night noise occurred when she allowed her five year old child to watch television until 11.30pm - something the judge described as 'remarkably irresponsible.' \nSentencing Bryce to eight weeks in prison, Judge Philip Gregory said \"You have displayed nothing but violent animosity towards your neighbour. \n\"I am quite convinced that you do not care tuppence about the effect that your behaviour has upon perfectly decent and respectable people next door.\" \n\"Everyone is entitled to live in a degree of peace and quiet with the usual give and take of society,\", the judge went on, \"but you do not behave like a civilised person and you have got to learn that you will.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T20:53:56.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
