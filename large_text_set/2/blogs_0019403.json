John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd’s raucous delivery is absolutely infectious, while their star-studded band—anchored by organist Paul Shaffer and Stax icons Donald “Duck” Dunn and Steve Cropper—unload plenty of thunder and lightning. Both “Soul Man” and “Rubber Biscuit” are torrents of blaring horns, funky rhythms, and manic fun, and the Big Joe Turner obscurity “Flip, Flop & Fly” features a hilarious, booze-soaked monologue from Belushi, who ingeniously channels the outrageous, bawdy side of the blues tradition. Customer Reviews NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE SOUNDTRACK by Knowledgable Although this CD is not the soundtrack, it is still a quite good CD. What you need to realize is that the blues brothers had an album before the soundtrack. This CD is the complete playlist so do not get mad at iTunes or the Blues Brothers. To end the confusion, I have the playlist for the Soundtrack below, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH BRIEFCASE FULL OF BLUES! 01 She Caught The Katy 02 Peter Gunn Theme 03 Gimme Some Lovin’ 04 Shake A Tail Feather 05 Everybody Needs Somebody To Love 06 The Old Landmark 07 Think 08 Theme From Rawhide 09 Minnie The Moocher 10 Sweet Home Chicago 11 Jailhouse Rock \"Briefcase Full of Blues\" is not, and was never supposed to be, the movie soundtrack. by ChuckC I don't understand all of the negative reviews here. This IS the full album, is is NOT a partial album, and you are NOT limited to buying track-by-track. Granted, this is NOT the soundtrack to \"The Blues Brothers Movie\" which came after the release of \"Briefcase Full of Blues\" which came as a result of the wildly successful recurring SNL skit. Rumor has it that the Blues Brothers routine was slapped together by John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd, both HUGE blues fan, when the musical guest backed out last minute. Have to go check the SNL archives to verify... As other posters have mentioned, I'd LOVE to see some of the other albums released by the BB', as well as the movie soundtrack (I LOVE Cab Calloway's \"Minnie the Moocher!\"). Briefcase Half Empty or Mostly Full? by Applejedi1 The Blues Brothers borrowed some of the best studio band guys from the Saturday Night Live Band. Belushi is just fine. There isn't a person associated with that movie, from James Brown to Aretha Franklin to John Lee Hooker to Ray Charles who couldn't tell you that they had a big lift off of their album sales. It introduced a whole generation, like me, to Sam & Dave, Cab Calloway, Elmore James, and a whole lot more. I love this album. Save us from record purists! Biography Formed: 1976 in New York, NY Genre: Blues Years Active: '70s, '80s Whether celebrated as a sincere tribute or derided as a tongue-in-cheek put-on, the Blues Brothers -- Joliet Jake and his silent brother Elwood -- was among the most popular groups of the late '70s; what started as a skit on the hit NBC television sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live quickly snowballed to become a true phenomenon, complete with hit records, a sold-out concert tour, and even a feature film. Clad in vintage black suits, narrow ties, fedoras, and omnipresent wrap-around sunglasses,...
