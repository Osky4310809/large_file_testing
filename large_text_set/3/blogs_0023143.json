STVM had not scored since late in the third. \nBut Jayvon Graves , as he did all game, left his mark on his final high school game. The senior had an assist to Lunden McDay and a dunk within seconds of each other to spark a game-ending 10-0 run and secured the school’s seventh state title, 45-30. \nSTVM (25-5) is now tied with Middletown for the most state titles in Ohio history with seven. \n“Over the last few years of the teams that we’ve brought here, this was probably the one that no one expected us to win,” St. Vincent-St. Mary coach Dru Joyce said. “It’s hard to explain when someone has the will to get something done and the will that these guys have shown.” \nGraves, a Buffalo commit, led all scorers with 25 points in his final high school game. \nHis assist to McDay was the first field goal of the fourth quarter for the Irish ended a scoring drought that lasted more than seven minutes. The play led to eight points for STVM in just 54 seconds to help secure its first championship since 2011. \n“After that, we got the momentum. We just kept going from there,” Graves said. “It means a lot after coming down here two other years and finally getting it done.” \nGraves and the Irish were tremendous defensively, forcing 23 Wauseon turnovers and turning them into 25 points. They also held Wauseon (27-2) to 43 percent shooting on only 28 attempts from the field. \n“I had been telling our guys that our 11 guys that we played, they were just going to be better than their seven,” Joyce said. “We were just going to wear them down sooner or later. And you could see in that last minute when we turned the pressure back up again, they couldn’t respond.” \nThe Indians grabbed the early lead in the first quarter. STVM responded with a 14-4 second quarter and never trailed after that. Graves had 10 of his 25 in the second quarter and the Irish kept Wauseon off the scoreboard for more than five minutes. \nLate in the third, Wauseon rallied to cut an 11-point deficit down to five. After the Indians had a 3-pointer rim out that could’ve cut the lead to two, the Irish went on their title-clinching run. \n“It’s something that you can’t describe. All the hard work paid off, everything,” said STVM guard Jon Williams , who had five points and three assists in his last game. “I wouldn’t change it for anything. It was amazing. It’s an amazing feeling.” \nAustin Rotroff led Wauseon with 18 points and nine rebounds. STVM senior forward Justin Sampson drew the assignment on him. Despite four fouls, Sampson did what he could to contain Rotroff and made him work. \nSampson finished his final game with six points and led his team with eight rebounds. \n“We call him the ‘Third Man’ because he gets us going sometimes more than we get him going,” Williams said. “(He’s) a freak of an athlete. He’s a great player, great friend to be with. I can say so many things about that kid.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:22:33.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
