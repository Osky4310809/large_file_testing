The veteran quarterback might have assumed he would get more game action last season after Philadelphia drafted Wentz with the No. 2 pick. But the team opted to start the rookie from the outset, leaving little opportunity for Daniel. \nThe Eagles reportedly added offset language in Daniel’s contract, allowing the team to get some cap relief on his $7 million base salary for 2017. There's offset language in Chase Daniel's contract, meaning #Eagles would get some cap relief on $7M base. Depends on next contract. \n— Jeff McLane (@Jeff_McLane) March 13, 2017 \nDaniel has started just two games and has thrown one touchdown during his seven-year career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:13:55.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
