This is so much so that they teamed up with sisters Reyna and Maritza Vazquez of Veracruz All Natural to create a special taco available just for March. The resulting El Norteño is based on Spoon’s favorite tacos and ingredients. It comes with tortilla chips, poblano and red bell peppers, Monterey jack cheese placed on top of an over hard fried egg, red onions, and bacon, all within a flour or corn tortilla. (Vegetarians can opt to go sans-bacon.) The taco collaboration came to be after the band’s manager, Steve Barnett, reached out to Veracruz earlier this year. Lead singer Britt Daniel came up with the name. All proceeds from the El Norteño taco will go towards local nonprofit American Gateway, which aids refugees and immigrants. It will be available at the East Cesar Chavez truck from Thursday, March 8 through Friday, March 31. Similarly, Daniel created his own breakfast taco with Los Angeles restaurant HomeState, benefitting a music nonprofit, in 2015. His came with with migas, pica de gallo, avocado, and Monterrey jack cheese (he seems to be a fan of it). Daniel also judged Austin Food & Wine Festival's Rock Your Taco competition in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T03:23:55.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
