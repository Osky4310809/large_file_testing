Because 20th-century machines have substituted not just for manual human tasks, but cognitive ones too,” Haldane said. \n“The set of human skills machines could reproduce, at lower cost, has both widened and deepened.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:04:31.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
