Foster Drive in Baton Rouge on Sunday, July 10, 2016. \nBaton Rouge, its police chief and several officers are rebutting allegations that the owner of a North Foster Drive convenience store where police fatally shot Alton Sterling last summer was illegally detained after the shooting. \nAbdullah Muflahi, in a lawsuit he filed six days after Sterling was shot July 5 outside his Triple S Food Mart, claims he was held without an arrest warrant for four hours in the back of a police car outside his store. Related Owner of store where Alton Sterling was shot files lawsuit against Baton Rouge police \nThe owner of the North Foster Drive convenience store where police fatally shot Alton Sterli… \nMuflahi says police then drove him to State Police headquarters, where he was illegally detained for two more hours while detectives questioned him. \nMuflahi and his attorneys contend the detention was unconstitutional. \nLawyers representing the city, Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. and officers Timothy Ballard and Robert Cook disagree and filed answers to the suit last month in the 19th Judicial District Court. \nThe nearly identical court filings set the scene on that fateful July 5 day: Officers were dispatched to Triple S Food Mart in response to a call about a man who allegedly threatened someone with a gun outside the north Baton Rouge store, and the situation escalated shortly after officers arrived at the scene. \nThe food mart was a potential crime scene; people at the scene were potential witnesses or perpetrators; and officers were unaware of Muflahi's status, the documents add. \nOfficers \"had a right to detain Mr. Muflahi for a reasonable time, dictated by the circumstances, to enable them to conduct a preliminary investigation,\" according to the answer filed on behalf of Ballard and Cook by senior special assistant parish attorneys Arthur Andrews and Tedrick Knightshead and Assistant Parish Attorney Michael Schillage. \nThe conduct of the officers was \"proper and reasonable,\" and the initial investigation was conducted \"promptly and with all due deliberate speed,\" the officers' attorneys argue. \nMuflahi, the officers' lawyers maintain, was not falsely imprisoned. \nOne of Muflahi's attorneys, Joel Porter, said in a written statement that Muflahi's Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable seizures were trampled by the investigative hold. \n\"The last time I checked, there is one legal standard under law for detaining someone or for arresting/detaining someone, and that is probable cause,\" Porter said. \"There is no investigative hold that I'm aware of that allows law enforcement officers to illegally detain someone who has not committed a crime. \n\"You must have probable cause to detain someone suspected of criminal activity. Mr. Muflahi was never suspected of any criminal activity.\" \nPorter said detention \"for custodial interrogation, regardless of its label, intrudes so severely on interests protected by the Fourth Amendment … to trigger the traditional safeguards against illegal arrest.\" \nMuflahi alleges in his suit that during his four-hour detention in a police car outside his store, he was escorted to the side of his building to urinate \"right there within arm distance of a (Baton Rouge Police Department) officer and in full view of the public.\" \nThe suit also alleges authorities seized surveillance video from the store. \nThe shooting of Sterling, 37, remains the subject of an ongoing federal investigation. East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore III recused his office from the case, citing his longstanding relationship with the parents of the officer who fatally shot Sterling.

The other officer involved in the altercation with Sterling is Howie Lake II. \nSalamoni and Lake also are defendants in Muflahi's suit. \nAny state criminal charges resulting from Sterling's shooting would be handled by the state Attorney General's Office. \n\nFollow Joe Gyan Jr. on Twitter, @JoeGyanJr. Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:33:19.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
