You cannot knock me out like that. \n\"She got me with a good head kick but I kept fighting. I hoped she was going fight with me. I love to brawl, I love to fight.\" \nIO want to fight erone and if CC is the one I need to fight I will fight her. I need to get suerger on my hand first.\" \nIn the co-main event, Anderson Silva was a controversial winner over Derek Brunson - his first victory since 2012. \nThe MMA legend looked to have lost at least two rounds against the younger man but was instead given the nod by all three judges. \nThe Brazilian was emotional after the result was announced, and said: \"I've worked hard for a long time and I just put my heart in it all the time. I'm too old for fighting, these guys are too strong.\" Anderson Silva of Brazil reacts after his win by unanimous decision against Derek Brunson (Photo: Getty Images North America) Derek Brunson lands a punch against Anderson Silva (Photo: Getty Images North America) \nEarlier, and in the same middleweight division, Jacare Souza made short work of Tim Boetsch, submitting him in the first round to stay on track for a title shot later this year. \nThere were also victories for Glover Teixeira over Jared Cannonier and for Dustin Poirier against Jim Miller.
