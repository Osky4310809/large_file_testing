After striking a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony against two of his companions that night, Lewis plead guilty for a misdemeanor charge for obstruction of justice. \nLewis received one year of probation a $250,000 fine from the NFL for his involvement in the incident. He went on to play 12 more seasons for the Baltimore Ravens, but the 2000 incident has never been forgotten.

I never have. That’s just me,” Lewis said. “That’s just me because of my culture and everything we came from.” \nThe Patriots will face the Atlanta Falcons in Houston on Sunday for Super Bowl LI. It will be an NFL record-setting seventh appearance in the Super Bowl for both head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:13:40.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
