Andrea dela Cerna said in a text message. \nThe incident happened at around 9 a.m. in Barangay Alejal, around seven kilometers away from DAPECOL. \nAn initial investigation revealed the suspect asked the driver to stop the bus before shooting Makilala once in the head. \nThe gunman alighted from the bus where he ran into Police Officer 3 Pablo Paulo, whose house was just 15 meters away from the highway. \nThe policeman was hit on the left leg when the suspect’s companion aboard a motorcycle shot him. Makilala’s assailant stole another motorcycle and the two fled towards the municipality of Santo Tomas, Davao del Norte.   \nThree civilians were wounded during the encounter and were brought to hospital. Probers recovered 17 fired cartridge cases and one fired bullet from a .45 caliber pistol and 11 fired cartridge cases from 9 millimeter caliber pistol at the scene. \n“The motive of the incident has yet to be determined,” said Dela Cerna. \nFormer whistleblower Sandra Cam, who introduced Makilala to then justice secretary and now Sen. Leila de Lima in 2012, said the victim had been receiving threats shortly after he exposed irregularities at DAPECOL. \n“He told me last month about the presence of drugs there,” Cam said in a phone interview. \nMakilala sought entry into the Witness Protection Program (WPP) of the Department of Justice after he exposed alleged illegal activities at New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City. \nShe blamed De Lima for what happened to Makilala, who she said was removed from the WPP and transferred to DAPECOL in 2013. \nCam said Makilala was removed from the WPP after a panel of investigators found probable a cause to file criminal cases against then BuCor director Gaudencio Pangilinan. \n“He was exposed there (to) all threats,” said Cam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:29:11.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
