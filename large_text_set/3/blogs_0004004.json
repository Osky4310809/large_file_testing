Although the celebration did not last, as the Red Bulls pulled past Atlanta United 2-1, fans from all over gathered to create the electric atmosphere. \nFor some, this monumental game was one they had been waiting decades for. \nFor others, it was a new family bonding experience. \n“I have been waiting 25 years for this game, for this team. It has been a long time coming and it is very, very exciting,” said Dallas Olson, a resident of Peachtree City, Ga. “I told my wife the day we got married that if we ever lived in a town that had a professional soccer team I was buying season tickets. It took 25 years, but here it is.” \nOlson, a life-long soccer fan who went on to play at the collegiate level at Presbyterian College in South Carolina, spent the evening with his son, who was thrilled to share in the experience. \n“It is amazing just to see the first Atlanta United game,” Patrick Olson said. “I always played soccer with my dad, and it is just great to be here.” \nWesley Williams from Lilburn, Ga., said he grew up in Georgia playing soccer, but never imagined the day would come that MLS would be in his hometown. \n“It is crazy. I have always liked soccer growing up, but I never thought it would come here. It is exciting to see a team here and see how excited everyone is; 30,000 season tickets, that is crazy,” Williams said. “Just seeing the atmosphere and how excited everyone is, it is just amazing.” \nWhile many may have picked up on the sport later on in life, for some, soccer runs in their blood as they grew up watching it for as long as they can remember. \nArgentina native Maitena Brill said she has followed fellow Argentinian Coach Gerardo “Tata” Martino for years, and is thrilled to have him in Atlanta, where she currently resides with her family. \n“We are so excited, especially with the Argentinian connection, it’s amazing. It’s going to be a great season,” Brill said. “I will be at every game, and my kids will be coming too.” \nThis caliber of soccer may be new to the city, but it is a sport that many have admired from afar and, if Sunday night offered any hints, it will be embraced by its newest home. \n“Getting into Mercedes-Benz Stadium will be amazing, I can’t wait for that game. I was looking forward to the first game, but that is the next milestone I am looking forward to. And I’m excited to see where we compare to the other teams in the MLS,” Williams said. “I think we can handle ourselves. We have a great lineup, a great team, great coach, and a great organization. Arthur Blank set it up well.” \nWith a young team and an experienced coaching staff, Atlanta United is on track to make this a season to remember.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:06:37.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
