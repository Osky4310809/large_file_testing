This is Grace from AAW. Ever since the rumor of the new iPhone’s 3.5mm port removal, we’ve been working on an MFi-certified DAC amplifier in several designs and prototypes for some time. \n\nIt’s my pleasure to finally introduce Accessport: High-resolution DAC/amplifier designed for iPhone 7, MFi-certified. We’ve been working closely with the guys at ADVANCED SOUND to develop and to bring this product to the market. Also we did not forget the Android community and will make Accessport available with microUSB and USB Type-C as well. \n\nWe have completed our T1 prototype of our Accessport and we are excited to share the details with you guys at Head-fi, first-hand. We will be launching the Accessport on Kickstarter and you can find the following details of the product: \n\nDigital Input: Lightning/USB Type-C/Micro USB \nFrequency Response: 10Hz~45kHz \nSampling Rate: 96kHz with oversampling SNR: (A-Weighted) -122dB", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T13:37:14.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
