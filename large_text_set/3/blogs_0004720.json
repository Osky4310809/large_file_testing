Nevertheless, some internet users reacted in anger and disdain (obviously) at KFC for neglecting traditional fried chicken.\nOf course, it turns out that the clip was just a prank to launch a much naughtier, more KFC-like burger —the “Dirty Louisiana.”\nAfter revealing the full video (which you can see above), KFC put out a press releasing stating that the idea for the campaign was based on “consumer fatigue” around the clean eating trend: “Let’s get real – no one is craving a quinoa salad, lusting over a kale and celery juice, going weak at the knees for chia seeds or daydreaming about raw veg crudités.”\nIndeed. Thankfully, the “Dirty Louisiana” contains a chicken fillet, three sauces (black pepper mayo, “supercharger” sauce, and BBQ sauce), two layers of cheese, cucumbers and a hash brown. Look out for the new burger hitting KFC locations in the UK and Ireland in the coming weeks.\nAfter you’ve finished watching the video, here are the weirdest Coke and Pepsi spinoffs over the years.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T16:08:16.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
