  \nFM 2017 will be completely free to play this weekend, which is great news for everybody who loves football's leading management sim. \nNow most of you will likely pick the team you support or a club with too much money for their own good when getting started - be honest, we all do it. \nOthers will go for a dead-and-buried team - and then quickly regret it. \nSo to fill you with inspiration after you download the game - and to re-inspire those who already have it - here are five teams you just have to have a go at managing. \nThey're certainly not the obvious choices, but they're a lot more fun, trust us. Monaco \nIt's a strong team to start you off with, but one of the more manageable teams on the list. \nMonaco are blessed with a young team with plenty of potential mixed with a few older heads - so they're perfectly set up to score goals for fun. \nThe Ligue 1 giants are a particularly attractive team to manage as there are a number of different ways to take the save. Kylian Mbappe can bring you glory (Photo: AFP) \nWill you cash in on the crop of starlets to fund bids for established names or hold onto them and maximise their huge potential and put major success off for a few seasons? \nTransfer Budget: £17 million Key Players \nKamil Glik \nThe best defender in the team, Glik has not only got the key technical and physical attributes that a top central defender requires but his mental game is world-class with high scores for bravery, determination and positioning. \nBernardo Silva \nThis Portuguese youngster has been on the radar of Europe's elite for the past few seasons and it's easy to see why. Bernardo Silva will be a standout performer in your team (Photo: Action Images via Reuters / Andrew Couldridge) \nHe scores highly for dribbling, first touch and work rate as well as in a host of other areas and he'll only get better as you progress through the game. \nKylian Mbappe \nMbappe earned his first call-up to the France squad last week after a breakthrough season at Monaco. Mbappe is ready for first-team football on Football Manager and has the potential to be the best player at the club. OGC Nice \nStaying in France, Nice have been the surprise package of Ligue 1 this season and their players have been given a boost in FM's January transfer update. \nNice are a club on the up and a lot of their squad are heading into the peak years of their careers which should make them frequent contenders for European qualification. Mario Balotelli, need we say more? (Photo: AFP) \nTheir youth team is full of hot prospects which gives a Nice save the potential to be a long-term project. \nTransfer Budget: £5.5 million Key Players \nMario Balotelli \nWhere else can we start but with Mario? The controversial striker has rejuvenated his career in the south of France after an underwhelming couple of seasons at Liverpool and on loan at A.C. Milan. His talent is undeniable and he will score you plenty of goals but you will need to find a Plan B in case Balotelli decides to cause trouble. \nYounes Belhanda \nThe attacking midfielder is on loan from Dynamo Kiev at the start of the save but can bought for £5 million at the end of his loan spell. Ready to take over Lucien Favre's job? (Photo: AFP) \nHis superb close control, speed and eye for a pass make him the man who will unlock opposition defences and his high long shots rating means that he will chip in with a few goals himself. \nJean Michael Seri \nSeri has all the right attributes you'd want in a central midfielder – good passing, excellent reading of the play, high work rate and quick. At 25 he's approaching his best years and will be your rock in the centre of the pitch for the next few seasons at least. Portsmouth \nMoving to England and a bit more of a challenge awaits. \nArguably Portsmouth have the best squad in League Two as well as the biggest transfer budget in the competition. \nThey're therefore the ideal choice if you fancy the challenge of taking a lower league club to the upper echelons of English football. Christian Burgess will be a huge player in your team (Photo: AMA/Getty) \nA solid defence, a creative and technically gifted midfield and the goalscoring threat of Eoin Doyle up front gives you a great chance of achieving the board's expectation of promotion in your first season. \nA large number of the squad are well suited to League One football too. \nTransfer Budget: £150,000 Key Players \nEoin Doyle \nDoyle is on loan from Preston but there is every chance of making the deal permanent at the end of his loan spell. Doyle will be your main goal threat in your first season with the Pompey coaching staff proclaiming him to be a leading player for any team in the league above. This boy means goals. \nChristian Burgess \nThe perfect Football League central defender. Burgess will ensure you keep clean sheets (Photo: Getty) \nReliable, organised, strong and with a solid set of defensive attributes Burgess will guarantee consistently excellent performances in a league where having a miserly defence is often the key to success. \nMatt Clarke \nOut injured for the pre-season period you'll want to get him fit and into your first-team plans as soon as possible. The most talented youngster on Portsmouth's books, Clarke will likely be good enough to stay in your squad right through to the Championship. Aston Villa \nStaying in England but moving up the divisions. \nThe former stalwarts of the top flight, Villa have been a club in decline for the past few seasons. \nThat said there are plenty of resources at your disposal to help restore the club to their former glory. Jack Grealish has lots of potential at Aston Villa (Photo: Neville Williams) \nChief amongst these are the January signings that the club made which will be available to you in Football Manager right from the start of the season. \nThere's a sizeable transfer budget to work with too which should make the board's expectation of reaching the playoffs more attainable in a highly competitive league. \nTransfer Budget: £10 million Key Players \nJack Grealish \nHis technical skill has never been doubted but his temperament has repeatedly been called into question. With the right man management, Grealish could still develop into a genuine star and getting the best out of him will be your first challenge in charge but get it right and you'll likely be back in the top flight next season. \nAlbert Adomah \nAdomah arrived from Middlesbrough back in August and is one of the best players at your disposal in the Villa squad. Albert Adomah will be one of the best players in your team (Photo: Neville Williams) \nA proven performer in the Championship, Adomah's pace and dribbling skill could be exactly what's required to earn promotion at the first time of asking. \nJonathan Kodjia \nBristol City's top scorer last season moved to Villa Park back in August and has wasted no time in setting his stall out as Villa’s chief goalscoring threat. A strike partnership with Scott Hogan should yield plenty of goals and Kodjia's pace combined with his high finishing rating should guarantee a double figure return from the Ivorian. Atlanta United \nAnd to the wildcard! \nOne for the football hipsters, Atlanta United are the new boys in the MLS. \nIf you're up to the challenge of managing in the US and its quirks such as the salary cap, the Draft and Designated Players then Atlanta could be the right team to do it with. Atlanta United, for all the hipsters out there (Photo: Getty Images North America) \nThere are some familiar names in the squad such as Kenwyne Jones, Tyrone Mears and Chris McCann with Brad Guzan arriving in July to add some strength up front. \nTransfer Budget: £1.1 million \nExpected Finishing Position: 6th in the Eastern Conference Key Players \nMiguel Almiron \nThis 22-year-old Paraguayan is Atlanta's best player and is amongst the very best that the league has to offer. He can boss play from the centre of the pitch and can mix it up by playing ranged passes or using his pace and dribbling ability to run at the heart of the opposition defence. \nBrad Guzan \nYou'll have to wait a few months for Guzan to arrive at the club from Middlesbrough but he could be the difference maker in your season. Brad Guzan will be a key man for your team between the sticks (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nAtlanta's goalkeeping department is solid but not spectacular and Guzan represents a significant step up in quality over the current first-choice, youngster Alex Steffan. \nHector Villalba \nLike Almiron, Villalba is a 22-year-old from Paraguay. Villalba plays out on the right wing and his game is built around speed which he can use to beat virtually any full-back in the league. He's a handy crosser of the ball too which could lead to him topping the club’s assist charts at the end of the season. poll loading How important has Football Manager been in your life? 2000+ VOTES SO FAR The only reason I know any players is because of Football Manager I form most of my football opinions based on FM stats STOP ASKING ME QUESTIONS AND LET ME GET BACK TO MY SAVED GAME!
