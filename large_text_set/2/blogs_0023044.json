Launched alongside the revamped 390 Duke was the 250 Duke, at a price of INR 173,000 (RM11,534). \nBoth single-cylinder machines in the previous generation Duke have proven to be very popular in the Indian market, and deliveries of the new generation models begin in March. Notable difference for the updated Dukes is the exhaust exiting on the right side, replacing the the previous model’s under-belly can. \nThe KTM 390 Duke has a single-cylinder, liquid-cooled 373.2 cc engine fed by EFI. There is no change in the engine for 2016, with power remaining at 44 hp, and dry weight at 147 kg. Ride-by-wire is now standard, along with a multi-function TFT LCD. \nAs for the KTM 250 Duke – which made it to our top five list of motorcycles in 2016 – the power plant is the same, but the exhaust, like the 390 Duke, exits on the right. An LCD screen and ride-by-wire is also standard equipment. \nThe middle-weight and quarter-litre Dukes still use a trellis frame, with the rear sub-frame now a bolt-on unit. The somewhat lacking fuel tank of the previous generation Dukes, at 11-litres, has now been replaced with a more useful 13.4-litre unit. \nA bisected LED headlight now adorns the front of the 390 Duke, complete with LED DRLs, while the 250 Duke makes do with the previous generation headlight for the Indian market, for cost reasons. Also for cost reasons, the 390 Duke gets Bosch ABS, while the 250 goes without. \nRevised graphics and colours are also much in evidence for the 2017 KTM 390 Duke and 250 Duke, which are rather more “aggressive” than previously. A chat with our source in KTM Malaysia revealed that the 2017 KTM 390 Duke and 250 Duke will not arrive in Malaysia “anytime soon.” \nGALLERY: 2017 KTM 390 Duke GALLERY: 2017 KTM 250 Duke Related Cars for Sale on", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:06:31.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
