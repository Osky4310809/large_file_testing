The Standard E manual is now priced at RM24,900 , up to RM463 more than before, while the Standard G manual now retails at RM34,900 , a premium of up to RM2,773. The Standard G auto is priced at RM36,900 , a jump of up to RM1,773. \nMeanwhile, the SE manual is now up to RM1,263 more expensive than before at RM37,900 , and the auto version costs up to RM263 more (although it’s RM137 cheaper than the previous price for metallic paint) at RM39,900 . The Advance auto is priced at RM42,900 , up to RM933 more expensive than before. All prices are on-the-road inclusive of insurance and a five-year/150,000 km warranty. \nWe’ve read about the new front grille, bumper and headlight design for the SE and Advance models, but the Standard E and G models will also come with a redesigned front end, and will feature projector headlights for the first time instead of the previous reflector items for these models. Click to enlarge \nAlso new is a tailgate handle (pre-facelift models only had an external keyhole), as well as chrome door handles and “spiral design” alloy wheels for the SE and Advance – the latter are likely the same 14-inch units as the ones on the Bezza Advance . Inside, the Standard models gain a new fabric seat upholstery, while the Standard G also benefits from a new USB port for the built-in head unit. \nMeanwhile, the SE and Advance models receive keyless entry, push-button start and a new touchscreen infotainment system with “Smart Link” screen mirroring for Android phones (previous SE had a simple radio/CD head unit with Bluetooth), all of which were derived from the Bezza. Other new features include a revised instrument cluster design with white illumination, plus new fabric upholstery for the SE. \nUnder the bonnet, the 1.0 litre three-cylinder engine now gets VVT-i variable valve timing, meaning it now has the same 1KR-VE mill as the base Bezza Standard G. Outputs are up 1 hp and 1 Nm to 67 hp at 6,000 rpm and 91 Nm at 4,400 rpm, sent to the front wheels via the same five-speed manual and four-speed automatic gearbox options as before. \nPerodua claims a fuel consumption figure of up to 22.5 km per litre with the manual, up from the current car’s 21.6 km/l and just a hair under the Bezza with the 1.0 litre engine and manual gearbox. \nThe paint palette has also seen some changes – the Standard G’s Lemongrass Green and Cherry Blossom hues have been discontinued, leaving just Ivory White, Glittering Silver, Ebony Black and Midnight Blue; SE and Advance variants retain their unique Sunflower Yellow and Lava Red options. \nLast but not least, Perodua has also revealed prices for the yet-to-be-unveiled GearUp accessories packages for the facelifted Axia, which now costs RM1,600 for the Elegant Body Kit, RM600 for the Elegant Seat Covers and RM2,000 for the Elegant Package with the bodykit and door visors. \nOne thing to note is that the Sporty Body Kit for the SE and Advance models has been dropped, which raises the possibility that the previously disparate Standard models and the sportier SE and Advance variants will have a unified look, similar to the Bezza range.
