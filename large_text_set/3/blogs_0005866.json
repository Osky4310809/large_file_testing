The Muslim ethnic group is said to have roots in the Middle East and West Africa.\nDolezal — who is the former president of the NAACP’s Spokane chapter and a one-time professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington University — has reportedly fallen on hard times since being exposed by her parents as white in June 2015.\nSpeaking to The Guardian last week, the disgraced civil rights advocate described how she had been unable to find a job or pay her rent in recent months.\nAfter her name change, she attempted to use her new identity to try and garner some positive attention, the Mail reports.\nDolezal started a Change.org petition in October, requesting that the TEDx organization post a controversial speeches she apparently gave in April 2016 at the University of Idaho.\nSEE ALSO \nRachel Dolezal is broke and may soon be homeless 0:0 Rachel Dolezal, the infamous white woman who for years passed... The petition was listed under the name Nkechi Diallo — and didn’t mention her birth name.\nWhile Dolezal only managed to get 30 of the 100 required signatures, TED decided to post the video anyway.\n“Refusing to post it would unduly limit an important conversation about identity, and the social underpinning of race — and would be counter to TED’s guiding philosophy of radical openness,” the organization said.\nDolezal, who once sued the historically black Howard University for racial discrimination, is slated to release a memoir next month, titled “In Full Color,” which will outline her life.\nShe told The Guardian last week that despite what people say, she still believes that she’s not white.\n“I do think a more complex label would be helpful, but we don’t really have that vocabulary,” Dolezal explained. “I feel like the idea of being trans-black would be much more accurate than ‘I’m white.’ Because, you know, I’m not white… Calling myself black feels more accurate than saying I’m white.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:35:52.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
