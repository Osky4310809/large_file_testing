Work and Pensions committee chair Frank Field (Photo: Julian Hamilton/Daily Mirror) \nThe Committee urged the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to provide more financial support for those claimants in the so-called work-related activity group (WRAG) who found they were unable to cover their essential living costs due to their condition. \n\"The Government expects the new, lower rate for the ESA-WRAG to enhance incentives to work. The evidence is, at best, ambiguous,\" it said. \n\"We heard substantial concerns about the possible impact of the new rate on disabled people's capacity to look for and move into work.\" Read More Sick man ruled 'fit to work' collapses and dies in street after visiting Jobcentre \nThe report also noted, that at current employment levels, halving the \"disability employment gap\" would require an extra 1.2 million to 1.5 million disabled people to find work. \nBut it cited one estimate by the Learning and Work Institute that on current rates of progress, it would take over 200 years to achieve. \nCommittee chairman Frank Field said: \"We expect the Government to respond to this report before the proposed new lower rate of ESA is due in April. \n\"If they intend to proceed with these cuts, we expect an explanation of how this will not be detrimental to its target of halving the disability employment gap, by making finding and keeping a job even more difficult for disabled people than it already is.\" \nA DWP spokesman said: \"Our welfare reforms are increasing the support and incentives for people to move into work, while keeping an important safety net in place for those who need it. In addition to ESA, we also offer support through Personal Independence Payments, to help with the extra costs associated with being disabled.\" \nLiz Sayce, CEO of Disability Rights UK, which gave evidence to the select committee's inquiry, said: \"The select committee is right to highlight the forthcoming cuts to Employment Support Allowance as wrong in principle and ineffective in practice. \n\"We're not aware of one single disability employment or benefits expert who thinks this particular cut will be an incentive for disabled people to get a job.\" \nAnd Mark Atkinson, chief executive at disability charity Scope, said: \"Today's report is yet another wake up call to the government that its cut to ESA is damaging to the everyday lives of many disabled people. \n\"We know that reducing disabled people's incomes won't incentivise them to find a job and won't help halve the disability employment gap. It will just make life harder.\" Debbie Abrahams, Shadow Secretary of State for work and Pensions (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nShadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams described the report as \"a clear indictment that the Tories are failing to support disabled people\". \n\"Under this Government, the disability employment gap is widening, sanctions are penalising - not helping - and cuts to Employment and Support Allowance will make matters even worse,\" said Ms Abrahams. \nRob Holland, of learning disability charity Mencap, said: \"This report shows yet again that the Government has presented no robust evidence that cutting disabled people's benefits will 'incentivise' them to find work. \n\"Instead the evidence suggests that this £30-a-week cut will push disabled people further from work, closer to or into poverty as well as affecting their health.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:37:40.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
