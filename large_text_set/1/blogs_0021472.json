Whedon, who directed the Avengers and identifies as a feminist, sent a tweet with a picture of Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, watching President Donald Trump signing documents.\n“Hey, keep your eyes on this fucking prize too,” Whedon wrote. “He’s a Voldemort in training, & unlike the Pekingese he married under, can play the long game.”\nHey, keep your eyes on this fucking prize too.

Breitbart highlighted a number of the responses sent to Whedon calling him out.\n@joss The left used to be better than this. You used to be better than this.\n— Actually Three Guns (@NotThreeGuns) January 24, 2017 \n\n@joss Just so we’re on the same page here. You just called Ivanka a dog because you don’t agree with Trump. Classy.\n— Ryan (@rylandes) January 24, 2017 \n\n@rylandes @GolightlyGrl427 @joss And he supposedly supports women…I guess just the ones who wear fake vaginas on their faces\n— Ster (@Ster24080753) January 24, 2017 \n\n@joss wow calling his wife a dog? I guess it’s OK to demean women as long as you don’t like them or their husbands, eh?\n— Dick Gazinya (@JaDingo) January 24, 2017 \n\n@joss Maybe next time just come out and say “bitch”. You ain’t fooling anyone with “Pekingese”. Is this how you fight for women’s rights?\n— Priest Of Gamers 🕹 (@AndyFrogman) January 24, 2017 \n\nWhedon is no stranger to controversial comments. He once called for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) to be brutally murdered.\n“Violence solves nothing. I want a rhino to fuck @ SpeakerRyan to death with its horn because it’s FUNNY, not because he’s a # GOPmurderbro ,” Whedon wrote on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:53:09.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
