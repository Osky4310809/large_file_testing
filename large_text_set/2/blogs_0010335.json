Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola celebrates with his player (Photo: PA) \nBournemouth have tripped up Liverpool and held Tottenham and Arsenal at home this season but there was no stopping City as their forward line tore Eddie Howe’s men apart. \nRaheem Sterling scored the opener, made the second - which substitute Sergio Aguero will surely be claiming even after it went in off Tyrone Mings - and they could have had more. Manchester City could be better side without Sergio Aguero, says Gary Neville \nBut it was equally telling that Guardiola saved his biggest hug after the final whistle for John Stones as the City centre half helped marshal an impressive defensive display. \nGuardiola, so often moody and tetchy even after victories, was smiling broadly as he strode onto the pitch to congratulate his players after stepping forward as Chelsea’s closest challengers.

If City can win there, reduce the lead to five points, then it will really be game on with nine matches left. \nCity clearly feel as if they can claw it back and they played as if they were on a mission, Sterling and Leroy Sane looking dangerous wide, David Silva controlling midfield and even an early injury to Gabriel Jesus did not derail them. Manchester City's Raheem Sterling scores their first goal (Photo: Reuters) \nMind you, when you can bring on Aguero to replace him, that illustrates City’s strength in depth because the Argentinian is still a world class striker. \nCity had to survive an early scare when Jordon Ibe played a brilliant one-two with Jack Wilshere, the Bournemouth winger then latched onto the return but was denied by a brilliant block by Willy Caballero. \nBut that was almost as good as it got for Bournemouth. Silva, Sane and Sterling carved Bournemouth open after 27 minutes before Sterling’s shot was deflected against the post by Steve Cook. Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores their second goal (Photo: REUTERS) \nThat let-off lasted just two minutes as Silva spread the ball wide to Sane and his cross was deflected again by Cook and this time Sterling fired home at the back post. \nA minute later, Bournemouth thought they had equalised but TV replays showed referee Neil Swarbrick was spot on for disallowing it as Josh King pulled Stones’ shirt before putting the ball in the net. Manchester City's Sergio Aguero celebrates his sides second goal (Photo: PA) \nBournemouth lost skipper Simon Francis to injury in the first half and Jack Wilshere also limped off in first half injury time after struggling to run off an ankle problem after making a block tackle on Fernandinho. \nBournemouth midfielder Harry Arter tested Caballero again after 67 minutes but City just took that as a warning and the cue to step up a gear again. Bournemouth's Jack Wilshere receives medical attention (Photo: REUTERS) \nFernandinho fed Sterling down the left, his low cross found Aguero and the ball deflected in off Mings. The spoilsports at the Premier League have given the goal to Mings, but you can bet Aguero still thinks it is his. \nSane got better as the game wore on and nearly got a third in the closing stages but smashed a shot against the bar. \nThat would have been tough on Bournemouth but no-one can argue that City thoroughly deserved their victory. poll loading Can Man City still catch Chelsea for the Premier League title? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:14:27.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
