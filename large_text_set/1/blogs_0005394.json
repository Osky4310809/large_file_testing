Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nApple has chosen its manufacturer for the next-generation Apple Watch and tasked the company with delivering better battery life, according to a new report. \nApple Watch Series 3 is also expected to bring improved performance, but its hardware is unlikely to come with any major changes. \nApple already improved upon both performance and battery life — addressing the two most common complaints with the original model — with Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2. But it is claimed these areas are again its main focus for the next-generation wearable. \nAccording to Digitimes , which cites a report from China’s Economic Daily News, Apple has already chosen Quanta Computer as its manufacturer for Apple Watch Series 3, which will make its debut in the third quarter of 2017. \n“Currently, improving battery efficiency is Quanta’s main task for the new Apple Watch and its other hardware will not see much change,” the report adds. \nPrevious rumors have claimed a future Apple Watch could offer a slimmer form factor and a camera for FaceTime calls . However, it would be incredibly difficult for Apple to make its smartwatch any thinner, and to add new components, without sacrificing battery life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T14:36:57.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
