I only knew three chords, too.” Lots of punk was Chuck Berry , beefed up to the point of absurdity.\nThe Beach Boys – Surfin’ USA The first great, defining Brian Wilson song was initially credited to him alone. From 1966 on, it was admitted Surfin’ USA was just Sweet Little Sixteen with different words, and the credit ran: Wilson/Berry.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch an early live performance of Surfin’ USA The Beatles – Come Together \nJohn Lennon settled out of court when sued over the lyrical resemblance between this and Berry’s You Can’t Catch Me . The Beatles’ debt to Berry was explicit.\nThe Rolling Stones – Little Queenie Mick Jagger and Keith Richards bonded over Chuck Berry, and his songs featured in their live shows for decades.\nT Rex – Jeepster Glam rock owed a huge debt to Berry, and Marc Bolan owed a greater debt than most. Jeepster is a distinctly Berryish shuffle and boogie.\nDr Feelgood – All Through the City Wilko Johnson’s hero was Mick Green, but the riff to this early standout from their career was pure Berry. And since Dr Feelgood inspired Gang of Four, there’s a direct link to post-punk.\nMC5 – The American Ruse The proto-punk godfathers covered Berry on their second album – and harnessed his guitar style to revolutionary sloganeering on The American Ruse .\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Motörhead – (I Won’t) Pay Your Price \nLemmy loved 50s rock’n’roll above all else, and this track from their second album is structured exactly like a Berry song, with the same bounce on the beat.\nFleetwood Mac – Albatross Peter Green’s slow blues might not be an obvious choice – but listen to it next to Berry’s Deep Feeling and you’ll see the link.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Faces – You’re So Rude \nBerry’s brilliance as a lyricist is overlooked. In this classic, Ronnie Lane channelled his bawdiness in a very English way in his own writing, which is Berryish musically, too.\nTopics Chuck Berry Music blog Pop and rock The Rolling Stones The Beatles The Ramones Fleetwood Mac blogposts  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:29:43.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
