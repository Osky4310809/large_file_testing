Pahlaj Nihalani defends the CBFC's decision of NOT certifying Prakash Jha's Lipstick Under My Burkha, while hitting back at them for creating a controversy for their film's benefit... By Karan Shah | Published: February 25, 2017 1:58 pm In Focus: Kareena Kapoor spotted in Dubai! \nOver the past few days, social media has been abuzz with news that the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has denied certification to Prakash Jha ‘s Lipstick Under My Burkha for being “lady oriented.”Many celebs and common people have slammed the board for rejecting the movie on these grounds and mentioned how it is acting as a moral police. However, CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani stands by their decision and hits back at makers! \nIn fact, he even slyly accuses the makers for creating the controversy just to generate a decent buzz around their film. Reacting to claims that the CBFC is acting as a moral police, Pahlaj Nihalani mentioned to Bombay Times, “All these charges (of moral policing) are made against the Censor Board because it is an easy target. We are just doing our job. Nobody questions an income tax officer or a doctor for doing his duty. The fact remains that some people make anything and then resort to controversies just to create a buzz around their films. This is, in fact, a way to get publicity.” ALSO READ – Twitterati slams CBFC for denying the certification of Lipstick Under My Burkha – check tweets \nPahlaj further added, “Have you heard of any big film being denied certification? How come so many films are being released if CBFC is acting as the moral police? The fact is that some of the producers don’t make films for the Indian audience; they make it for festival circuits or maybe something else. Their films are shown in festivals without any certificate after they seek special clearance from Information and Broadcasting ministry.” ALSO READ – Why are we becoming such an intolerant country, questions Konkana after Lipstick Under My Burkha was denied certification \nNihalani even spoke about denying a certificate to Prakash Jha’s movie, when he said, “The film ( Lipstick Under My Burkha ) was rejected at the first step itself and was presented for review. It was again rejected by the committee. There were no changes suggested because it is a case of plain rejection. Now, the producer can go to the tribunal and seek redressal; this is the course followed by many other producers, too.” Published: February 25, 2017 1:58 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T10:39:13.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
