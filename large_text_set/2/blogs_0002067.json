He has a green card. He works in telecommunications as an engineer. The cybersecurity job he really wanted eludes him because he has Syrian citizenship. He understands that companies in computer security require clearances he can't meet. It's a reality he has learned to accept since he arrived in the United States in 2009 and earned a master's degree in science from the University of Arizona. \nLeaders from two Baltimore-based relief agencies — the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service and Catholic Relief Services — talk about President Trump’s order banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim nations and Trump’s indefinite ban on refugees from the Syrian civil... \nIn this podcast: \nLeaders from two Baltimore-based relief agencies — the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service and Catholic Relief Services — talk about President Trump’s order banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim nations and Trump’s indefinite ban on refugees from the Syrian civil... (Dan Rodricks) \nMore recently, Mallouhi, who is Christian, mentored a family of Syrian refugees who are Muslim. He told them that, to feel settled here, all they had to do was \"play by the rules,\" and things would be OK. \n\"I told them to make peace with that,\" Mallouhi says. \"'As long as you follow the rules,' I told them. But now ... I can't say that.\" \nThe rules changed on Friday with Trump's executive order. \nNow Mallouhi doubts he will be able to obtain the visa he needs to fly to Germany to visit his parents. He had been planning the trip for several months. \nIn a challenge to Gov. Larry Hogan , General Assembly Democrats unveiled a package of initiatives Tuesday they billed as a defense of Marylanders' rights against the actions of President Donald J.

(Michael Dresser) \n\"With the new [order], it's not a guarantee I will be able to go back to the U.S.,\" he says. \"So the German Embassy is not going to issue me a visa.\" \nGermany has taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from the civil war in Syria. \n\"Maybe it's clear to the American immigration that green-card holders are allowed to go back [to the U.S.], but not the Germans,\" says Mallouhi. \"My passport is a Syrian passport.\" \nSo Mallouhi canceled his visit to the German Embassy, then canceled his 10-day vacation and his April flight out of BWI aboard WOW Air. (The airline said it would give refunds or offer to change tickets with passengers from the seven countries not permitted to travel to the United States.) \nAgain, I heard Mallouhi say, \"I don't feel I belong here,\" and it sounded more plaintive than complaining. \nHe struck me as grateful for what he had, but betrayed by this change in the rules. \n\"I pay taxes, and I deserve to be treated like everyone else,\" he says. \"I think this is not the right way to make America safe.\" \nCertainly the people who support Trump's executive order must know that it's hype. Certainly those who proudly declared they were fed up with politicians must realize that Trump, in the best tradition of politicians, has sold them a cake filled with air. \nIt might look like he's fulfilling a campaign promise, but come on: Is keeping Malaz Mallouhi from visiting his parents in the national interest? Is stopping the relative trickle of Syrian refugees, mostly women and children, coming into the United States really going to make you sleep better at night? \nThe country is no safer today than it was last Thursday, before Trump signed his order. There's no data, no logic to support the ban. \nI realize that many of you prefer data that supports Trump and all the magical things he's done since taking office. \nBut allow me to offer some information from the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security at the University of North Carolina. It was published just a few days ago, and it's the center's eighth annual report on Muslim-American involvement in violent extremism. \n(Some of this information appeared in a Sunday blog post on this subject, but I believe it's worth repeating.) \n•Since 9/11, there have been no fatalities in the United States caused by extremists with family backgrounds in the seven Muslim-majority countries (Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen) under the Trump executive order.
