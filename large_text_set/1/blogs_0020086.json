AP \nLOS ANGELES, United States — US actress Meryl Streep on Tuesday was nominated for her 20th Academy Award, making her the most nominated performer in Oscars history and maintaining her reign as the queen of Hollywood. \nThe 67-year-old actress was nominated for best actress for her role in comedy biopic “Florence Foster Jenkins,” which tells the story of a singing socialite in New York. \nStreep broke her own record with Tuesday’s nomination — 16 for best actress and four for best supporting actress. Actors Katharine Hepburn and Jack Nicholson tie for second with 12 nominations each.

Sad! #MerylStreep,” said Annie Clark on Twitter. \nStella Rouse quipped in another Twitter message that Tuesday’s nomination was “yet further proof of #alternativefacts that she is overrated.” \nStreep got her first nomination for an Oscar in 1979 for her performance in the Vietnam war drama “The Deer Hunter.” \nShe extended her lead as the most nominated actor ever with her 19th nod in 2015 for “Into the Woods.” \nShe has won the coveted golden statue three times, most recently in 2012 as Margaret Thatcher in “The Iron Lady.” Before that she won in 1980 for “Kramer v. Kramer” and 1983 for “Sophie’s Choice.” CBB", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T04:19:25.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
