Well, we could do what others haven’t done. Yes, despite the seemingly endless stories and social media postings written about the Golden Globes honoree and her elitist put-down of the president-elect and his supporters, there is one more revelation to be made…one more unexploded truth bomb to be dropped. \nAnd it has to do with the man for whom the recognition bestowed on Streep Sunday night was named — legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille.

DeMille — considered by film historians to have been the founder of the Hollywood motion picture industry — was also considered to have been a conservative Republican activist. Someone who believed in and worked for campaigns and causes that one can only imagine Streep would squawk about. \nWait, she did what? The DeMille award for lifetime achievement was accepted by the same Meryl Streep who actually told a ballroom overflowing with the rich and famous made rich and famous by pretending and profiting from their pretense: “You and all of us in this room really belong to the most vilified segments in American society right now.” Advertisement - story continues below \nStreep went up on stage Sunday night and went far over her allotted speaking time to indulge the self-indulgent glitterati gathered for the awards show in her six-minutes of fear mongering and accepted the award named for an industry icon who championed states’ right-to-work laws in defiance of unionism? \nStreep proudly clutched the Golden Globe award named for a Republican activist who, as a biographer notes , had once been endorsed by the California State Republican Committee for senator and governor but ultimately declined both nominations. DeMille apparently felt he could influence more people through movies than through public office. \nAnd this might be the most telling irony in the Streep acceptance of the Cecil B. DeMille award, a recognition that gave her the chance to deliver her high-and-mighty liberal sermon — one that insulted people who like the NFL and the MMA — in such solemn and sincere tones: \nThe real problem the prolific filmmaker faced in the late 1930s — the seemingly insurmountable challenge that convinced DeMille not to run for office as a Republican, according to the biographer — the GOP establishment in California did not believe he was electable.
