What a dud of a storm. Just completely blew it’s wad like a two pump chump all up and down the East Coast today. Bummer we didn’t get the 20+ inch dumping the beast coast expected. It’s also why I think naming winter storms continues to be the dumbest overhype method on the planet .\nThis Bro, however, wins the day. He headed out to Long Beach on Long Island to try surfing “for the first time” (…eyeroll), asking NYC’s PIX 11 for a ride back to his car.\nIn Long Beach, which saw 3 to 4 inches of snow by noon, along with ice and slush, PIX11 caught up with a man attempting to surf for the first time ever.\n“It’s a little bit sloppy,” he said of the waves, noting he had never gone out before. “I think I’ll try surfing again … this is like, my first time surfing.”\nHe’s the Spicoli-with-a-stach the world needs. Glad you got out there today, Bro.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T01:17:19.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
