Uh, ‘Lil Foster, are you gonna go ahead and keep standing right where you are? Yep, that’s because the younger Foster on Outsiders is not at all pleased that his father has been allowed to slip right back into the family mix, even enjoying the trust of Bren’in G’Win, after all of his many (many, many) misdeeds (including committing the murder for which Lil Foster was accused and jailed). In the clip above from Tuesday’s new “Loyal to the Bones” episode, Big Foster walks in on Lil Foster (Ryan Hurst) enjoying some frisky time with his new girl, and B.F. lets his son know he’s disappointed that he’s skipped an important council meeting to play house (actually, play “tent” in this instance). But ‘Lil Foster doesn’t much care what his daddy thinks about anything. Elsewhere in an especially contentious outing, the coal company tries to run the Farrells off the mountain by poisoning their food and water supplies, prompting G’Win to decide one of the coal execs needs to visit Shay Mountain and see firsthand the damage the company is causing. Of course, said exec may not exactly be a willing visitor… Outsiders airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on WGN America.
