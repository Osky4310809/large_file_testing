Jordan, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, and Angela Bassett. \nThe Age of Ultron scenes filmed in Seoul depict the Avengers attempting to retrieve the Vision’s body from a moving truck after Ultron steals vibranium. Whether this scene will have anything to do with the Black Panther film is unclear at this point. \nThe report does not state which of the stars will report for filming in Seoul, and with plot details barely beginning to trickle out, all fans can do is speculate. \nBlack Panther follows T’Challa who, after the events of Captain America: Civil War, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T’Challa’s mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk. \nBlack Panther arrives in theaters on February 16, 2018.
