They are among 975 high school seniors who applied for the prestigious program.\nMembers of the new class are:\nNatalie Casal of Atlanta, Georgia; Elise Driver of Nashville, Tennessee; Jessica Goldberg of Saint Louis, Missouri; Janie Hubbard of Nashville, Tennessee; Joshua Karchmer of Memphis, Tennessee; Jasmin Norford of Suwanee, Georgia; Oceane Parker of College Station, Texas; Jenny Pigge of Iowa City, Iowa; James Raubenheimer of West Chester, Pennsylvania; Margaret Redic of Charlotte, North Carolina; Daniel Roque of Miramar, Florida; Adam Skelton of Anchorage, Alaska. They will join the 270 Vanderbilt students and alumni who have been awarded the Ingram Scholarship since 1994. From that first class of four undergraduates and two incoming freshmen, the program has grown to include approximately 50 Ingram Scholars attending the university at the same time.\nThe program was conceived in 1993 by E. Bronson Ingram, president of the Vanderbilt University Board of Trust from 1991 until his death in 1995, as a way to encourage students to combine a professional career with a commitment to community service.\nIngram Scholars engage in 20 hours of community service each month and also design and implement projects that address significant community needs. The program encourages Ingram Scholars to create projects that become self-sustaining.\nIngram Scholars receive a minimum of full tuition and a stipend for a summer project. In cases of demonstrated need, additional financial aid may be provided.\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:00:58.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
