Thieves stole jewelry worth $2 million from Alanis Morissette at her home in Los Angeles. the singer was not present during the incident. Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Image North America / AFP LOS ANGELES, USA – Burglars made off with $2 million in jewelry from singer Alanis Morissette's home in the upscale Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood, US media reported Tuesday, February 14. The Canadian-born alternative rock giant was not at home when the thieves struck on Thursday, February 9, celebrity news website TMZ said, although police were not immediately able to confirm the report. The break-in comes less than two weeks after Morissette's former business manager, who worked for other entertainment and sports figures, admitted embezzling more than $6.5 million from his clients. Jonathan Schwartz, 48, entered his plea to federal wire and tax fraud charges for failing to disclose the embezzled funds to the Internal Revenue Service. He is due to be sentenced on May 3, and faces a prison term between four and six years. He acknowledged that between May 2010 and January 2014, he withdrew about $4.8 million belonging to Morissette without her knowledge or authorization.

The singer was the voice behind a string of energetic rock anthems in the mid-1990s including \"You Oughta Know,\" \"Hand in My Pocket\" and \"You Learn.\" Her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill won the Grammy for Album of the Year, making the then 21-year-old Morissette the youngest winner of the prestigious award until Taylor Swift. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
