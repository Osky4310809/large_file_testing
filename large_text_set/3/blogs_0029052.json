Photographer Billy Fernando noticed the scene and snapped a series of incredible photographs. 3 \n“As I was standing outside, I saw the firefighter, Mr. Klein, running toward the curbside grass area carrying something,” Fernando told The Dodo . 4 \n“I didn’t know what it was at first, but then I realized that it was a pet who had been trapped in the fire. The dog was unconscious, limp and not moving at all.” 5 \n“Just a minute after, [the firefighter] began performing CPR on the pet without any hesitation,” said Fernando, adding: “It was an awe-inspiring moment.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:04:35.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
