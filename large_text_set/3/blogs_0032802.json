The way they break down our favorite shows to their base elements and play with the fragility of our feelings would be almost tragic if it weren’t so laughable. But nothing is safe from their candid crosshairs, including the long-running shonen anime Naruto , which just came to an end on March 23 after a 15-year run. To celebrate the end of the mega-popular anime series, ScreenJunkies is giving Naruto the Honest Trailers treatment with their very first Honest Anime Trailer! \nHave you ever been at a convention and wonder why a bunch of people in headbands were running with their arms behind their backs? You can thank Masashi Kishimoto ’s legendary series Naruto for that. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg for the Naruto Honest Trailer, which dissects the epic ninja thrown downs, Sasuke and Naruto’s one-sided bromance, and the feels. Oh, the feels. \nFans love when Honest Trailers give characters honest names and now Team 7’s true forms are finally revealed: Therapy No Jutsu (Naruto), Fall Out Boy (Sasuke), She-Hulk (Sakura), Plagiarism Ninja (Kakashi), and many more hilariously on-point descriptions. \nNaruto’s dream is to become the Hokage–another term for the greatest ninja in his village–and don’t we know it. As the trailer shows, he says it over and over and over , and well, more times than we even realized. Spoiler alert: he finally does become the Hokage and, after a long 17 years, Naruto has closed up shop to make way for Boruto: Naruto Next Generation , a new series about the next generation of shinobi. I’m guessing in this series the word Hokage will be followed by an eyeroll and a “meh.” Millennial shinobi…I can see it now. \nDid this Honest Trailer hit close to home for Naruto fans?
