On her first day at Sunnydale High, Buffy meets bitchy Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), lovable nerd Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), computer geek Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) and librarian Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head). But no sooner has she started to settle in to her new school than dead bodies begin to turn up drained of all their blood; it seems that Sunnydale is also plagued by vampires I'm far from what you would call a Joss Whedon fan-boy: I hated Serenity, I think that Alien Resurrection is easily the worst thing to ever happen to the Alien franchise (yes, even worse than Prometheus), and I wasn't all that impressed by Avengers Assemble. But in the case of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, I find that Whedon's writing style works, the self-aware dry humour and snappy dialogue actually befitting of his characters. Of course, my enjoyment of this series also owes a lot to the impossibly perky Gellar as the cute yet tough titular slayer, who kicks major undead butt while wearing very short skirts.This pilot episode serves primarily as an introduction to the excellent ensemble cast, which also includes David Boreanaz as the mysterious Angel, and Julie Benz and Brian Thompson as nasty vampires Darla and Luke, minions of this season's main bad-guy, The Master (Mark Metcalf). 1 of 2  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T06:29:21.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
