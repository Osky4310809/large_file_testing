Hawk created video game to lure fans back \nThe sport lost fans in the 1990s, but Hawk turned his attention to creating a skateboarding video game in an effort to lure them back. \nThe first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was released in 1999, and there are now 10 titles in the series.

(ABC News: Dylan Clunes) \nHe carried on competing and is still considered a legend in the skateboarding world. \nLast year he managed to land his signature trick — a 900-degree aerial spin, commonly referred to as \"the 900\". \nIt was 17 years to the day since he landed his first one at the X Games in San Francisco. \nAt the time he said: \"I never thought I'd be doing this at this age, [but] I'm still going — I'll keep going until the wheels fall off, I guess.\" \nThis Sunday he will compete against fellow skateboarding veterans, Steve Caballero and Mike McGill, who are both in their early 50s.

(ABC News: Dylan Clunes) \n\"I was the only girl skater at my local park for about a year and now there are lots of local girl skateboarders, you're seeing new faces pop up everywhere,\" she said. \n\"It's really fun just having more competitors — we all push ourselves and it's just a really supportive sport, so it's really fun competing with all the girls.\" \nEthan Copeland, 11, is one of the youngest competitors in the Bowl-A-Rama event. \n\"It's really awesome to know that you're skating with the best in the world and they're supporting a local competition,\" Ethan said. \n\"I'm really hoping to get a 540 which is where you spin 540 degrees.\" \nSkateboarding will be included at the next Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020, as part of an attempt by the International Olympic Committee to bring the games to young people. \n\"The most exciting part of the Olympics for me is you'll see skate teams form the most unlikely countries — Cambodia, Ethiopia, Afghanistan,\" Hawk said. \n\"There are strong skate teams in those countries that no one knows really about and they're going to be at a world venue and that's incredible to me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:44:45.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
