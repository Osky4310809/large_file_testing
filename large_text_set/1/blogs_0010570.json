We spoke about the kind of activities the Russians can be engaged in. \n\"We also spoke about how Mr Trump may find himself in a position where there could be an attempt to blackmail him with Kompromat (the Russian term for compromising material) and claims that there were audio and video tapes in existence.\" President-elect Donald Trump Credit: REUTERS/Mike Segar \nS ir Andrew, who was ambassador to Moscow between 1995 and 2000, denied having seen the dossier at the time of the meeting and added Mr Steele was \"very professional and thorough\". \nThe dossier was leaked earlier this week, and Britain now finds itself caught in the crossfire of accusations between Russia and the US. \nLast night Britain was dragged into the frantic row after it was claimed that the Government gave the FBI permission to speak to the former MI6 officer who compiled it. Christopher Steele, the former MI6 officer who compiled the dossier \nS ources in the US have told The Telegraph that Christopher Steele, a former spy, spoke to officials in London before he handed the document to the FBI and met one of its agents. \nOn Thursday Russia publicly accused MI6 of “briefing both ways” against Russia and Mr Trump and suggested Mr Steele was still working for the Secret Intelligence Service. \nThe Russian embassy in London used its official Twitter account to say: “Christopher Steele story: MI6 officers are never ex: briefing both ways – against Russia and US President.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T09:54:54.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
