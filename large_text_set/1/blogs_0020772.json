The video has since been pulled from the Internet. \nAfter a fan alerted the actress to the video via Twitter, Palmer quickly responded, condemning Trey Songz for releasing the visuals despite continually expressing her reluctance to be involved. \n“This was not approved. You can not use someone’s ‘likeness’ without their approval. Casing point of female disrespect in the industry,” she tweeted before continuing in a string of subsequent posts. “I didn’t even know they were filming. Meanwhile I said I did not want to be in the video. I said it more than once and kept being pressured. I remember this day very well because I so badly didn’t want to be in the video that I HID IN THE CLOSET to avoid conflict. I literally said no. I can’t believe they still put me in it. I said no!” This was not approved. You can not use someone's \"likeness\" without their approval.
