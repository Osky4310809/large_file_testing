People we weren’t expecting. I know that we are all going to make a deal on healthcare. That’s such an easy one. I have no doubt that that’s going to happen very quickly. We have all been promising it — Democrat, Republican — to the public.” \nThose in attendance in the East Room event included Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., who were critics of the House Republican healthcare proposal, as well as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

Hopefully it will start being bipartisan because everybody really wants the same thing,” he said. “We want greatness for this country that we love.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T21:07:23.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
