We think free speech includes hearing Milo’s important perspective. #CPAC2017 pic.twitter.com/ssDS6HVmLN \n— Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) February 18, 2017 \nYiannopoulos took to Facebook Sunday night to answer his critics and specifically address a video that’s been circulating that accuses him of supporting sexual relationships between underage boys and men: Here is the uncut 5 minute video of Milo Yiannopoulos advocating for Pederasty involving \"13 Year old\" and \"older men.\" HIS WORDS. @Mschlapp pic.twitter.com/mAgmfpuyvu \n— The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) February 20, 2017 Trending Liberals ATTACK 'mafia wife' Melania Trump for reciting Lord's Prayer \nHere’s Yiannopoulos’ response in its entirety where he calls the video “selectively edited” and states “I do not support pedophila. Period.” \nOf note, some reports stated Yiannopoulos is the keynote speaker at the conference, but this isn’t true: (Important to note that Milo is not keynote speaker. Hollywood Reporter piece was incorrect. Keynote is Michael Reagan, per @mschlapp .) \n— Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) February 20, 2017 Nachman he's not the keynote. That honor is for Michael Reagan on fri. We invited over 75 other speakers https://t.co/hhDscVKx7Y \n— Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) February 20, 2017 \nThe American Conservative Union released the following statement on the controversy, saying Yiannopoulos “will bring perspective to the stage” but they do realize “this invitation will be accompanied by controversy”:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:34:51.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
