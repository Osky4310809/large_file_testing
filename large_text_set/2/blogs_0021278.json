This Sunday will mark the 37th Golden Raspberry Awards. \nSome A-list celebrities are actually quite good sports about their nominations. \nAs The LAD Bible reports, Halle Berry poked fun at her own emotional Oscars acceptance speech when she picked up her Worst Actress Razzie for Catwoman.

Actor Sylvester Stallone arrives at the 88th Oscar Nominees Luncheon (Photo: Getty) \n\"When he heard he was up for Worst Actor of the Century, we did get a voice mail that sounded like him - for legal reasons we can't say it was him,\" Wilson told The Hollywood Reporter . \n\"But his point was, my movies make money, stop picking on me.'\" Read More Stallone and family at the Golden Globes (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"You're not exempt from the Razzies if your movie made money.\" \nStallone should not be too disheartened at his Razzie infamy. \nEven Laurence Olivier got a nod for Inchon in 1982, proving that the awards are a breath of fresh, irreverent air in an industry awash with egos and hangers-on.
