Toughest rules \nNew guidelines came into force in England in 2013 making the policy on unauthorised term-time absences the toughest in the UK. \nThe change followed concerns that some families had started to see going away in term-time as an entitlement. \nUnder the rules, if a school declares an absence unauthorised, the council can fine each parent £60 per child - and this doubles to £120 if not paid within 21 days. \nCouncils in England have varying policies on term-time holiday fines. Some issue thousands of fines - others barely any. \nThe case is forcing many to look again at the detail. \nMost parents simply pay the fines to avoid prosecution, but Mr Platt says thousands have contacted him for advice on fighting the fines. \nMany parents complain that the cost of going away in the school holidays can be four times as much as during term-time - but the government says there is clear evidence \"that every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil's chance of gaining good GCSEs, which has a lasting effect on their life chances\". \nA DfE spokeswoman said the government's position remained that children should not be taken out of school \"without good reason\". \n\"That is why we have tightened the rules and are supporting schools and local authorities to use their powers to tackle unauthorised absence.\" \nMinisters are also considering changing the law on term-time absences, depending on the outcome of the case. \nJudgement is expected during the first part of 2017.
