Expect Vitolo to operate as part of the forward line in a 4-3-3 but drop into midfield in a 5-3-2. \nAs Leicester have started to use two strikers again under Shakespeare, the 5-3-2 with three central defenders may have the edge. \nPotential starting XI: Rico; Mariano, Mercado, Rami, Pareja, Escudero; Nasri, N'Zonzi, Vitolo; Ben Yedder, Jovetic. BETTING & GAME ODDS \nDespite Leicester's resurgence, Sevilla are 5/4 favourites to win away from home according to Oddschecker . The Foxes are available at 12/5 and the draw is best priced as it stands at 11/4. \nLive & FREE football on TV this week \nSevilla are heavily favoured to qualify at 2/7, with Leicester a 3/1 shot. The Spaniards' two front men Stevan Jovetic and Wissam Ben Yedder are 11/2 joint-favourites to score first, with Jamie Vardy and Islam Slimani the top picks for the hosts at 7/1. GAME PREVIEW \nThere should be no revisionist history as to the incredible feat Claudio Ranieri accomplished by guiding Leicester City to the Premier League title last season on the back of two wins without him. His legacy will remain. \nBut it is obvious that the club's players have taken issue with the way the Italian has been portrayed as the sole reason for the Foxes' success last season and nothing to do with their downfall during the current campaign. After struggling for direction until Ranieri's departure, they are now playing as if they have a point to prove once again. \nPerhaps even Craig Shakespeare feels that way, with his part in the title triumph mostly going without recognition until his recent emergence into the public eye as caretaker manager. Both current players and those formerly associated with the club have spoken of his work ethic, coaching excellence and strong relationship with the squad. \nLeicester are back to their best in the Premier League but their fast-paced, counter-attacking 4-4-2 remains relatively untested in Europe. They began their continental campaign in that shape but the only top-quality side they faced was Porto and with mixed results, winning 1-0 at home before losing 5-0 away. \nRanieri's final gift was to ensure Leicester remained in this tie going into the home leg. Having lost 2-1 in Spain, another 1-0 victory - a result they specialised in last season - will see them through to the last eight and the magic continue a little.
