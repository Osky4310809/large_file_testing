We weren’t surprised when the Grammys got political with Jennifer Lopez’s presentation of the Best New Artist Grammy.\nBut what we loved was that J.Lo’s speech wasn’t negative or critical. Instead, it was a positive message to inspired artists and creators to let their voices be heard. J.Lo quoted legendary novelist of Beloved and Sula during her speech, and we thought it was the MOST perfect choice.\nJennifer Lopez quoted Toni Morrison during her presentation, and her words are SO important for all of us. #GRAMMYs : @JLo says artists' voices are needed now more than ever pic.twitter.com/i2Rk0LBjy3 \n— Variety (@Variety) February 13, 2017 “As Toni Morrison said, ‘This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self pity, no need for silence, and no room for fear. We do language. That is how civilizations heal.'” Jeff Kravitz / Getty That’s a bit of a paraphrase, but here’s Toni’s original quote: “This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language. That is how civilizations heal. I know the world is bruised and bleeding, and though it is important not to ignore its pain, it is also critical to refuse to succumb to its malevolence. Like failure, chaos contains information that can lead to knowledge — even wisdom. Like art.” Kevork Djansezian / Getty \nWe love that, because it’s a message of hope in troubling times. It gives us a goal and some way to put ourselves to work. And after watching all the amazing performances tonight, we are SO inspired. So keep writing. Keep speaking out. Keep doing language. Because we can all heal together.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:23:58.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
