Ram is the latest brand to fall under its spell, announcing a dark-themed appearance package for its 1500 Rebel, the Rebel Black. \n- \n-The Rebel Black displays its allegiance to the dark side with black wheels, a black brush bar, and a black interior (with available leather) that features black anodized trim, gray contrast stitching, and heavy-duty floor mats. Although it’s shown here painted black, all the other Rebel colors (silver, white, gray, and red) are available. The crew-cab-only Rebel Black can be had with a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 or a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 providing the motive force. The starting price is $46,910.\n- \n- - 2016 Ram 1500 Rebel Mopar ’16 Tested: The Ears Have It - Ram 1500 SSV (Yes, the Cop Version) Tested! - Ram 1500 Research: Full Pricing, Specs, Reviews, Photos, and More! - -Of course, the standard Rebel is pretty well blacked out its own self, and the Rebel Mojave Sand —unveiled at the Los Angeles auto show in November—offers another path into the darkness, with its black wheels, lower-body color, hood stripes, and interior.\n-When it comes to blackness and the Ram Rebel, more is definitely more.\n- \n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T07:25:57.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
