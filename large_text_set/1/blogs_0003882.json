By Alex Thompson Print \nIn 1919, President Woodrow Wilson suffered a devastating stroke that left him partially paralyzed, semi-blind and so fragile that his wife and doctor hid him from the public. In 1923, Wilson’s successor, Warren G. Harding, died suddenly in office from what was later determined to be congestive heart failure. The fragile mortality of the presidency was on display like at no other time in American history, and in 1928, Congress codified a new White House position: the personal physician to the president. Now, a doctor would always be on hand if the president was physically ill. \nLeft untouched in 1928, however, was the president’s mental health. After all, mental illness in the 1920s was most commonly associated with asylums, not the White House. But nearly a century later—and after a revolution in the science of psychiatry—we now know that anyone, even presidents, can suffer from a mental illness. The newly sworn in Congress now has a chance to strengthen the health of all future presidents by appointing a psychiatrist from the military to work alongside the presidential physician.One of the most stressful and consequential offices in human history ought to have easy access to the best medical care available, including when it comes to mental health. Story Continued Below \nThis is not about assuaging the fears or stoking the jeers of those who have called Donald Trump a psychopath or a narcissist. The assumption that presidents have robust mental health was wrong long before the 45th president came along. As I have written before , at least two presidents—John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon—surreptitiously took daily psychiatric medications such as Valium and other anxiety treatments while occupying the Oval Office. Another—Lyndon B. Johnson—was so emotionally erratic that his top aides consulted psychiatrists and confronted the first lady about his behavior. And Abraham Lincoln experienced such deep bouts of depression during his life that he was confined to bed and contemplated suicide. \nDespite the mercurial behavior and pill-popping, there is no one employed to keep tabs on the president’s mental health. Nor has any presidential physician ever been a trained psychiatrist. Today, the presidential physician periodically releases a summary of the president’s checkups, but these reports do not contain psychiatric information. Those presidents who are known to have received psychiatric medication had to arrange for it in secret, most often from doctors without backgrounds in mental health. (We do know, however, that Nixon received prescriptions from a psychiatrist while serving as vice president.) \nMental health problems have been de-stigmatized in American culture over the past few decades, yet mental health remains fair game in the political arena—as some presidential-level politicians have learned the hard way. In 1972, reports arose that George McGovern’s running mate, Thomas Eagleton, had undergone shock therapy. Eagleton eventually withdrew from the ticket, and McGovern’s judgment was called into question. President Nixon, meanwhile, kept his psychiatric medication secret by getting a Valium prescription from his and Henry Kissinger’s osteopath, as reported by Evan Thomas in his book Being Nixon . And Michael Dukakis got tagged with the psychiatric stink without even seeing a psychiatrist. As George H.W. Bush’s campaign was trying to gin up rumors about Dukakis’ mental health, President Ronald Reagan answered a question on the topic by quipping, “Look, I’m not going to pick on an invalid.” The political media went wild, and Dukakis’ large lead in the polls began to shrink. \nIt’s true that some mental illnesses are so severe that they would make one unable to serve as president. But the greatest governing risks—not just to the president but to the world—come from not getting treatment. Just as physical illnesses include everything from the flu to terminal cancer, mental illnesses range in severity from treatable anxiety disorders to more serious diseases like schizophrenia. “A president can function very well if he has a mild anxiety disorder or obsessive compulsive [disorder],” President George H.W. Bush’s presidential physician Burton Lee told me. Indeed, some already have. \nThe introduction of a presidential psychiatrist would surely carry political risks. Would the president’s judgment be trusted if people knew of psychiatric sessions? What would happen if the president’s medical files were leaked and the public found out the commander in chief was on anti-depressants? \nIn fact, the appointment of a presidential psychiatrist would actually be the most politically prudent way for a president to receive psychiatric care. As is the current practice with the presidential physician, the president could choose to keep any or all parts of his or her psychiatric medical files private. Even appointments need not be disclosed. The leak of any medical information about the president would breach both doctor-patient confidentiality and the military chain of command, providing an extra layer of privacy to the president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:40:17.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
