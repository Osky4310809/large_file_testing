Nick Viall took his remaining women down to New Orleans for some Southern comfort on The Bachelor ’s Monday, January 30, episode, where some women were locked in a dark haunted house and others were encouraged to toy with voodoo. PHOTOS: 'The Bachelor' Season 21: Meet Nick Viall's Bachelorettes! \nCorinne Gets Called Mature \nThe showdown between Corinne and Taylor continued, but it didn’t get any more interesting than where we left off. They bickered about emotional intelligence a little more, then Corinne told Nick that Taylor wasn’t there for the right reasons and Nick praised Corinne’s maturity. Feeling successful, Corinne gloated in her interview, “I f--kin’ smacked the s--t out of her and she doesn’t even know it!” Maturity level: 10/10. \nMoving right along to the rose ceremony, Alexis , Corinne, Danielle M. , Jaimi , Jasmine , Josephine , Rachel , Taylor, Vanessa and Whitney all received roses. Danielle L. , Kristina and Raven already had date roses, leaving Astrid and Sarah newly single.

As Rachel flitted off to her date, she vowed to not bring any pastries back for the drooling women, showing her true colors. \nThe date was a totally standard Bachelor one-on-one, beginning with Nick and Rachel exploring a local market and cutely tasting foods, then moving to the famous Café Du Monde for the promised beignets and joining a Second Line street parade that was casually thrown in their honor. “I had no idea he had swag like that!” Rachel raved about the Bachelor, while we checked Urban Dictionary to see if “swag” got a new definition. \nOver dinner, Rachel told Nick that her father is a federal judge, which made Nick’s eyes pop out of his head a little bit, but didn’t scare him away completely. After exchanging ‘I like yous,’ Nick gave Rachel the rose. Nick and Rachel Mark Coffey/ABC \nSomeone Slips the L-Word \nAlexis, Danielle L., Danielle M., Jaimi, Jasmine, Josephine, Kristina, Raven, Vanessa and Whitney were called for the group date, much to all of their relief, which meant that (surprise!) Corinne and Taylor would be together for the two-on-one. \nBut it turned out the group date wasn’t much better than duking it out with one other woman for the rose because the group date took place in a haunted mansion. Sure, there were mint juleps, but there was also the ghost of a tantrum-prone 8-year-old that even the non-believers couldn’t deny. \nWhile most women were exploring inside the house, Nick sat a comfortable distance away from the mansion for his time with Raven. She accidentally brought up “the moment [she] fell in love with [Nick],” which prompted Nick to do a double take as Raven continued to plow through her story. Later in her interview, Raven admitted, “I said it, whatever. I own it.” \nDespite her confession, Nick plucked the rose from under a glass case, a la Beauty and the Beast , and handed it to Danielle M. PHOTOS: Biggest Bachelor and Bachelorette Villains \nIt’s All in the Cards \nJust to point out how different these two women are, here’s how they prepped for their joint date on the bayou: Corinne relaxed in a bubble bath, smoothed on a face mask and went to town on three full plates of food, and Taylor sat quietly and sniffed calming oils. \nKeeping things completely normal on this date, Nick sat in the middle of his two ladies — each with a hand on either of his legs — on a boat ride through the bayou, where they were led to a path in the woods. “Why are we here, where something got eaten?” Corinne wondered as they walked by a spine on their trek. \nThen they came upon a voodoo priestess and her camp to have their tarot cards read. Because things felt too tense among the three of them, Corinne and Taylor had their cards read separately. Taylor went first, while Nick and Corinne had some alone time.
