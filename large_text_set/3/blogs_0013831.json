He has also proposed a tax holiday for corporations to repatriate profits held overseas at a 10% rate. These changes are expected to reduce incentives to increase the proportion of foreign earnings relative to domestic ones, to hoard cash overseas, and to shift tax bases to other countries through corporate inversions . Manufacturing firms will have the option to expense capital investment in exchange for giving up the corporate interest expense deduction . After three years, this election becomes permanent. Trump's plan will also increase tax incentives for employers to provide onsite childcare facilities. \nInfrastructure (skip to top) \nTrump has promised to dramatically increase infrastructure investment. His most notable project is the wall he has promised to build along the border with Mexico. On January 25 Trump ordered the wall's \"immediate\" construction and instructed Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly to identify an allocate \"all sources of Federal funds\" to begin work. Trump insists that Mexico will reimburse the U.S. for the cost of the wall, which he has estimated at $5 billion to $10 billion. Independent estimates and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell have put the cost as high as $25 billion . \nTrump's initial proposal to force Mexico's hand involved amending the Patriot Act to disrupt the flow of remittances to Mexico, which his plan valued at $24 billion per year. Trump said that move would force the Mexican government to make a one-time payment to fund the wall's construction. In his January 25 executive order, Trump instructed executive agencies to identify all aid to Mexico, including humanitarian and military funds, suggesting those could be a source of funding for the project. The next day press secretary Sean Spicer suggested that taxing Mexican imports at 20% could earn \"$10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone.\" \nBeyond the border wall, Trump has made early moves to encourage other infrastructure projects, including a flurry of executive actions on January 24, one of which set up a process to identify high-priority projects and expedite environmental and other approvals. The order specifically named improvements to the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, as well as repairs and upgrades to highways, bridges, ports, airports and pipelines. \nPipelines were the focus of three additional presidential memos, signed the same day. Two of the memos cleared the way for the construction of the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, both of which the Obama administration had rejected. A third mandated that pipelines be built using American materials, specifying that steel and iron products must be made in the U.S. \"from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings.\" Whether that stipulation will affect the economics of pipeline projects or run afoul of trade rules (in Keystone XL's case) is unclear. \n$1 Trillion \nIn a \"contract\" laying out promises for his first hundred days in office, Trump proposed $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years, adding that the spending would be \"revenue neutral.\" In August, he floated the idea of funding an $800 billion to $1 trillion investment through infrastructure bonds . His campaign site says the money will come from private-public partnerships , cutting red tape, eliminating wasteful spending, and \"leverag[ing] new revenues.\" Despite his promise not to increase the deficit – and occasional promises to eliminate the national debt – few observers expect the infrastructure plan to be revenue neutral. \nHealthcare (skip to top) \nTrump has promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act , commonly known as Obamacare, which has seen premiums soar and competition erode on its signature exchanges. The exact nature of this replacement is still unclear, but Trump has promised to release a plan once Tom Price , his nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, is confirmed. \nA section of Trump's campaign site promises simply to \"replace Obamacare with Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) .\" A document posted to the site lists a number of proposals, but cautions that these are \"simply a place to start.\" These include funding Medicaid through block grants to states; allowing insurers to sell plans across state lines; letting patients to deduct health insurance premiums from their tax returns and shop for the most cost-effective treatments; importing drugs; ​forming high-risk pools; reforming mental health programs; and cutting back on costs through stricter immigration policies. A number of these proposals overlap with Price's proposed \"Empowering Patients First Act,\" which also focuses on protecting doctors from \"lawsuit abuse.\" \nTwo days after the election, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he would keep popular portions of Obamacare, including the provision that prevents insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and the one that allows children to stay on their parents' plans until age 26. He has ruled out keeping the individual mandate, which requires those who can afford it to purchase insurance or pay a penalty. Without the mandate, these policies are probably unworkable, since insurers would not be able to turn down the sick and the healthy would be able to choose not to buy insurance. \nRepeal Efforts \nDespite the lack of clarity around Obamacare's eventual replacement, Trump and congressional Republicans are moving ahead with repeal efforts. In his first day in office, a Friday, Trump signed an executive order instructing agency heads to \"exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\" \nThe language of the order is broad enough to potentially allow parts of the law to lapse due to lack of enforcement. In a press conference the following Monday press secretary Sean Spicer declined to say whether the administration would enforce the individual mandate. \nThe week before Trump's inauguration, Congress passed a budget resolution that could be used to roll back portions of Obamacare without the risk of a Democratic filibuster. While the Senate voted along party lines, nine House Republicans voted against the measure due to worries about what would replace Obamacare. \nCBO Estimates \nOn January 4, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an estimate of the effects a previous Republican proposal would have on the uninsured rate. H.R. 3762 – which was written by Tom Price, passed in January 2016 and was vetoed by Obama – would have eliminated penalties for not obtaining health insurance, subsidies for purchasing it on an exchange, and the \"Cadillac tax\" on expensive health plans. It would also have reversed the expansion of Medicaid eligibility. It would not have abolished the exchanges or the requirement that insurers offer coverage to people with preexisting conditions. \nThe contours of Price's bill are similar to the Trump campaign's proposals, and if he is confirmed, he will likely be the architect of Obamacare's replacement. The CBO found that his bill would increase the number of uninsured people by 18 million after a year, over and above the current level (around 28.5 million at the end of 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation). After two years the increase would be 27 million people; by 2026 it would be 32 million. In other words, the total number of uninsured would be around 60 million people. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services estimated in March 2016 that 20 million people have gained coverage under Obamacare, though conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation dispute this claim. \nThe CBO also estimated that premiums for policies purchased on exchanges and directly from insurers would rise by 20% to 25% after a year, over and above projections under current law. They would be around 50% higher a year later and then double by 2026. Meanwhile insurers, faced with unsustainable market dynamics, would pull out: half of the country's population would live in an area with no participating insurers within a year, and the proportion would rise to three-quarters by 2026. \nRegulation (skip to top) \nTrump has railed against what he has characterized as excessive, stifling regulation. In an executive order signed on January 30, Trump instructed agencies to identify two regulations to be eliminated for every new one they adopted, a first step to fulfilling a campaign promise. He also mandated that the incremental cost of new and eliminated regulations not exceed zero in fiscal 2017, which ends on September 30, 2017. Because repealing rules often involves a process nearly as complex as the one involved in making them, however, it may be difficult to keep costs that low. \nTrump also promised to \"cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.\" He has been particularly critical of energy regulations meant to curb pollution and climate change; his nominee for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt , sued the agency a number of times over its regulations when he was Oklahoma's attorney general (see \"Energy\" below). \nShortly after his election victory, Trump promised to \"dismantle\" the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act , a 2010 financial regulation law that passed the House without a single Republican vote and the Senate with only three. Steven Mnuchin , Trump's pick for Secretary of the Treasury, said the law was \"way too complicated and cuts back lending\" in a November 30 interview with CNBC. He identified the Volcker Rule , which aims to prevent banks from making risky bets with consumer deposits, as a particular source of unneeded complexity. In an executive order issued February 3, he laid out principles he said should guide financial regulation; while the order did not mention Dodd-Frank, it was perceived as an attack on the law. \nImmigration (skip to top) \nTrump made immigration a centerpiece of his campaign from the time he announced his candidacy in June 2015. In that speech, he offered this description of Mexican immigrants: \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" He proposed building a wall along the southern border and changing federal law to prevent those born in the U.S. to undocumented parents from automatically gaining citizenship (it is not clear whether a change in the law would be sufficient to eliminate birthright citizenship, or if a constitutional amendment would be needed). \nHe initially advocated deporting all undocumented immigrants in the United States – an estimated 11 million people – and in December 2015 called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" He later moderated those positions slightly, promising instead to deport \"criminal aliens,\" whose number he put at two million (that estimate has been disputed). He also walked back his ban on Muslim immigration, calling instead for a suspension of immigration from \"terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.\" He has called for \"extreme vetting\" of everyone entering the U.S. \nMexico \nIn a pair of executive orders on January 25, Trump ordered the \"immediate\" construction of the wall, as well as new detention centers. He ordered an end to what he called \"catch and release\" and \"asylum abuse,\" writing that parole should be granted only for \"urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit.\" Carving out an exception to his earlier hiring freeze , he ordered 5,000 additional border patrol agents to be hired. \nHe ordered agencies to \"employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution fo the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens,\" prioritizing criminals and those who \"have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits.\" The order did not specify which benefits are meant – whether public schools count, for example – or what constitutes \"abuse.\" \nTrump also ordered the attorney general – his nominee Jeff Sessions is awaiting Senate confirmation – to cut off federal funds to \"sanctuary cities\" and called for the creation of a database detailing crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, who will be exempted from Privacy Act protections. \nMiddle East \nOn the afternoon of January 27, a Friday, Trump signed an order barring the entry of all refugees for 120 days, shutting out refugees from Syria indefinitely, and imposing a 90-day ban of all entrants – \"immigrant and nonimmigrant\" – from seven Muslim-majority countries: Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. The ban was rapidly enforced in airports across the country, which soon attracted protesters. Permanent residents were detained, since the administration did not immediately clarify that these were exempt. \nJudges in four states issued emergency stays against the order over the following weekend, preventing those who had been detained from being deported. Few were released, however, and reports indicated that some people were being deported anyway. \nThe order caps fiscal 2017 refugee admissions at 50,000, less than half the Obama administration's goal for the year. It prioritizes applicants who are religious minorities and facing religious persecution, which some have interpreted as favoring Christians – in line with Trump's promised Muslim ban – but could in theory apply to Sunnis in majority-Shi'a Iraq, for example. \nThe order also creates another database documenting charges and convictions for terror offenses by foreign nationals, as well as cases of gender-based violence such as \"honor killings.\" This database is in addition to one Trump created to track crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. \nNational Debt (skip to top) \nTrump repeatedly criticized the growth of the national debt – which stands at nearly $20.0 trillion as of January 30 – under the Obama administration. In March 2016, Trump told the Washington Post that he could eliminate the debt within eight years. During the vice-presidential debate , Mike Pence said, \"when we get back to 3.5% to 4% growth, which Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.\" Independent analyses, on the other hand, see Trump's plan to lower taxes and boost spending on infrastructure and defense as adding trillions to the debt (see \"National Debt\" under Economic Forecasts above). \nIn May, Trump appeared to indicate that he would consider repaying less than the full amount the U.S. had borrowed. While his statements were unclear – and he denied he was \"talking about with a re-negotiation\" – he argued, \"you can buy back at discounts, you can do things with discounts,\" and, \"I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.\" \nEnergy (skip to top) \nDonald Trump has repeatedly called climate change a \"hoax,\" and in 2013 he tweeted, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\" \nGiven this stance, and his enthusiastic courting of voters in Appalachia's coal country, Trump's positions favoring fossil fuels shouldn't come as a surprise. In his promises for his first hundred days, he said he \"will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.\" His nominee to head the EPA, Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt , has said the \"debate\" on climate change is \"far from settled.\" \nShortly after taking office, Trump signed a series of executive orders and memos calling for the resumption of work on the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, which the Obama administration had rejected. In an order that laid out a process for expediting environmental approvals for high-priority projects, Trump named pipelines as an important category of infrastructure projects. A new requirement that pipelines be constructed from local content, however, could make them more costly (see \"Infrastructure\" above). \nIn May, Trump said he would renegotiate last year's Paris Agreement , which saw the U.S., China and 109 other states pledge to limit average global temperature rises to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Later in the month he threatened to \"cancel\" it. His plan for the first hundred days includes a promise to \"cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure.\" \nMonetary Policy (skip to top) \nTrump has been at his least consistent when it comes to monetary policy . He said the Fed was \"creating a bubble\" with low interest rates in August 2015. He warned the following May that raising rates could strengthen the dollar and cause \"some very major problems,\" adding that the dovish Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen , is a \"very capable person.\" By September he was back to criticizing low rates, as well as charging the Fed with doing political things and being \"more political than Secretary Clinton.\" \nThe Fed has a Congressional mandate to generate maximum employment (4.5% to 5% unemployment ) and steady prices (annual core PCE inflation of 2%). Aside from those requirements, however, it is independent , meaning it does not have to seek approval from any branch of government to change monetary policy. Given Trump's accusations that the Fed is acting politically, some have expressed the worry that Trump will attempt to curtail monetary policy independence, as several past presidents have done. Narayana Kocherlakota, who was president of the Minneapolis Fed until December, wrote the week after Trump's victory, \"there is absolutely nothing in U.S. law preventing Trump from violating the Fed's independence, a post-1979 development that rests largely on the restraint of the president.\" \n2018 Budget (skip to top) \nOn March 16 the Office of Management and Budget released a \"skinny budget,\" the first stage of the administration's fiscal 2018 federal budget proposal, which limits itself to discretionary spending. The proposal increased Department of Defense funding by 10.0% or $52.3 billion to $527 billion. It funds this increase with cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services ($12.6 billion or 16.2%); to foreign aid programs run by USAID, the Department of State and the Treasury ($10.9 billion or 28.7%) and other programs. The overall level of discretionary spending falls by $2.7 billion or 0.3% to $1,065.4 billion. (See also, Trump Budget Funds Pentagon with Cuts to Health, Aid . ) \nThe budget cuts the EPA's budget by 31.4%. The Departments of Labor and Agriculture would lose over a fifth of their funding under the proposal. It would also defund 19 programs entirely, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, the National Endowment for the Arts and the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. Early pushback from Congressional Republicans indicate it undergo significant alterations before it is passed.
