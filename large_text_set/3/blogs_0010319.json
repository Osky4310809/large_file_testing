People shower bright colours on each other, symbolizing blessings of peace and tranquility. \nThis Thursday, the festival took on a particularly meaningful hue in the narrow lanes of Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh, with thousands of widows gathering to smear colour on each other. These widows have been abandoned by their families and have travelled from various parts of the country to stay in this holy land where Lord Krishna spent his childhood, and where his blessings are believed to linger. \nWhile, traditionally, enjoyment of any type is proscribed for widows, extending to wearing coloured clothes or playing Holi, these archaic rules have been broken in Vrindavan for some years now, with special festive celebrations planned for widows every year. \nHoli festivities start almost a week early in Vrindavan, with widows congregating at the Gopi Nath Temple to pray and play. The celebration starts with what is known as \"phoolon wali Holi\" (Holi with flowers) and is followed by the singing of bhajans and dancing... the widows moved in a devotional fervour, dancing like the Gopis of Lord Krishna. \nAfter the flower Holi the air was filled with the gulal, coloured powered in different colours and in moments not only the widows but all the others present were consumed by the heady spirit of the festival. More than 1500 kilograms of gulal and flower petals were arranged for the huge celebration. SUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW \nGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
