B*Witched will celebrate their 20th anniversary (Photo: Rex Features) \n\"We're not gonna try tap into what we were because that's nostalgia and the music industry has moved on so much as we all have ... we've updated it so we feel comfortable with it.\" Read More B*Witched thrill fans at G-A-Y with sexy Irish-themed performance for St Patrick's Day \nAnd while they are looking forward to celebrating two decades since the release of the 1998 number one, Edele admits she got \"fed up\" with getting the song stuck in her head. \nShe confessed to the Daily Star newspaper: \"I think it's incredible. I think at some point I was getting a little fed up with it, and two years ago I did pantomimes and we had C'est La Vie in the pantomime.

It's very dramatic and there's lots of emotions. It's been huge.'' \nKeavy added: ''But I feel more together as a band now than we did at the beginning of rehearsals because we weren't a band at all, so it was actually quite awkward.''
