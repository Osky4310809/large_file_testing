Blue Marble Private \nThe RMS Titanic, which collided with an iceberg in 1912 just four days into her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City, is arguably the most famous shipping disaster in history. \nThe once glamorous ship was brought to life in the 1997 blockbuster \"Titanic,\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, the closest most people have ever been — or will ever get — to seeing what it was like. \nThe Titanic's remains still sit at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, although few have had the chance to visit them. \nNow, a London-based travel company is offering the chance to discover the shipwreck up close. \nThe RMS Titanic. Alex Lawrie / Lawrie Cornish \nBlue Marble Private is launching diving expeditions to the wreckage from May 2018. \nNine people at a time will go on an eight-day journey, starting off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. \nA \"specially-designed titanium and carbon fibre submersible\" will take the divers along with a crew of experts to depths of up to 4,000 metres. Divers will have the chance to swim over the ship's deck and famous grand staircase. \nIt marks the first time since 2005 that it has been possible for the public to dive to the site of the Titanic, according to The Daily Telegraph. \nBut it's not cheap. The newspaper said the expedition is expected to cost $105,129 (£86,500) per person, which — taking into account inflation — is the equivalent to what a first class passenger would have paid to board the Titanic in 1912. \nThe bow of the ill-fated Titanic.
