Legislation had to be passed to end this autonomy and make education a national asset. \nafford fees can't afford them. \n\"We must not view education as wasteful spending. We must view it as an investment into the future, something which will spark innovation in the long run.\" \nEducation should only be free for those unable to afford it.
