The official synopsis of the show reads: Carrying only what they can fit in a backpack, the survivalists are completely separated from one another in harsh, unforgiving terrain to hunt, build shelters and fend off predators. They will face extreme isolation and psychological distress as they plunge into the unknown, self-documenting their experience. \"Alone\" is the ultimate test of man’s will to survive. The person who lasts the longest before tapping out is the winner of a $500,000 prize. Unlike other shows like Survivor or Naked And Afraid , these survivalists will have no teams, no partner to keep them company, no production or camera crew and no show host. The series is self-documented as each of the cast members battle the elements, build shelters, protect themselves from predators and try to stay sane. Now that you're up to speed on the new, dangerous series, click through our gallery to get to know each of the 10 survivalists who are in it to win it.
