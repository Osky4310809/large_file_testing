For most people, the top three apps are generally: Facebook ( Messenger ), Instagram and Snapchat . While it's true that the Facebook app consumes a lot of resources, it will also work on just as well on a cheaper smartphone too. \nApp Annie did an analysis of the most downloaded and installed apps from Google Play Store . Looking at both the free and paid apps, none of them (apart from the odd exception) are really able to make use of the full potential of a high-end device, not even close to it. At the end of the day, we mostly just use Facebook Messenger. / © AndroidPIT \nAs for gaming, which is supposed to really push a phone's GPU to its limit, even the games that are supposed to really test the phone's capacity aren't able to unlock the phone's full potential. In fact, for the most downloaded games in the Play Store, most mid-range phones are also perfectly capable of running these games smoothly. \nWhile it's true that for the most demanding games like Asphalt 8 or Real Racing 3, you will get a better gaming experience on a high-end device, you can also get a decent experience playing on a mid-range phone. However, THE most downloaded game Bubble Witch 3 Saga doesn't even come close to frying any device's GPU. Understand your smartphone better \nOf course, there is a certain portion of the audience who are photography fans or who seek a superior gaming experience . For those of you who fall into that category, obviously the hardware (camera, processor and GPU) is an important factor. Particularly for photography, the best results can only be achieved with high-end devices like the Google Pixel , HTC 10 or the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge . But sometimes you may find a hidden gem in a mid-range device, like the Moto G4 Plus, the LG G5 , the Sony Xperia X Compact or the Honor 8. \nThe majority of people are content with just taking photos with friends or of landscapes, filtering and sharing images on their social media networks - or just playing Candy Crush Saga. The Huawei P8 Lite 2017 or the Honor 8 can tackle these kinds of tasks without any problem. The Honor 8 is a perfectly good mid-range phone. / © AndroidPIT \nI should just clarify, I am not saying we should decrease or stop the production of high-end smartphones - these devices are extremely important to showcase new technologies and concepts, for gaining reputation and for coming up with features that will eventually end up in mid-range devices. \nAre you a user who plays the most demanding games on your phone and uses apps that really test the various components or your phone? Or conversely, do you just need a smartphone that is able to manage your day to day tasks? Depending on your answer to these questions, you'll be able to make the best decision on whether to buy an expensive yet powerful high-end device or take your chances with a cheaper but perfectly capable mid-range phone. \nAre you satisfied with your smartphone and using it to its full potential? Or maybe you want to change to a new device to better suit you use? We want to know your thoughts in the comments below! \nWith contributions from Santiago Luque 18 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T02:20:11.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
