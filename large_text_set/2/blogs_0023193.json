T he Making History actress isn’t anything like her former Gossip Girl character, but they both do love fashion.\nWhile attending Kate Spade New York’s fashion show and party at the Russian Tea Room last week, she had a little chat with Elle . She talked about her new TV show — which premieres on March 5th — her past movie roles, and Blair Waldorf…obviously.\nThe magazine noted that it was the first time that the Texas native had attended Fashion Week since her Gossip Girl days, which is totally wild. The series ended in 2012, and according to Meester, heading to Fashion Week was both familiar and very different from when she would go as a Gossip Girl star.\nThe CW “It does feel like it used to, but at the same time, my own life is so different. I look a little different, my hair got thicker [laughing], there are new things in my own life,” Meester told Elle about her GG days. “But Fashion Week is easy because I love clothes. And I will say, I’m one of those actors who loves promoting their show.”\nLater in the conversation, the 30-year-old actress revealed what Blair would be up to in 2017, and it’s exactly what we would’ve guessed.\n“Ohhhh…let’s see…when we last left Blair Waldorf, she had a kid with [Chuck Bass], and she was running her own fashion company. And I think it was going really well, wasn’t it?” she wondered.\n“So in 2017, Blair Waldorf is probably about to debut her new fashion line. She’s probably doing New York Fashion Week!” she added. “She’s got a runway show somewhere.” \nAfter finding her happily ever after, marrying Chuck, and then flashing forward to being married five years with a son, it seems like Blair would be back to fashion and focusing on herself.\nShe has to keep herself busy or else someone else would become Queen B, which would NOT be okay.\nWhen asked if Blair’s collection would be amazing, Meester simply said, “Obviously.” The Country Strong actress does know Blair better than anyone, so we can totally believe her 2017 predictions.\nAll we want to know is if Blair’s BFF, Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) is one of her runway models? She also had an obsession with fashion, so it would totally work!\nWhat do you think Blair and Serena are up to in 2017?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:50:50.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
