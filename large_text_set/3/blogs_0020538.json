Wednesday, in which he called upon Congress not to repeal President Obama’s signature piece of legislation. \nAfter making his argument for why the U.S. needs to keep Obamacare, he turned his attention to the Republican Party. \nWATCH: \n“There’s nothing fundamentally changed in the Republican party in the last 12 to 15 years except they have a president now who is a little more colorful,” he stated, drawing laughs from the crowd. “That is a polite word, but it’s about time we’re polite.” \n“Here’s the deal. When you cut to the chase, we’re talking about eliminating close to a trillion dollars in benefits that go to people to be able to meet the commitment we made that health care is a right, and we’re transferring all of that to the wealthy.” \n“That’s what this is all about,” Biden continued. “It’s about a transfer tax basically. eliminating the affordable care act means eliminating an awful lot of things that people badly need in return for what?” \n“It’s a transfer of about a trillion dollars from those folks out there to everybody in this country. That’s what it is, and that’s classic Republican politics.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:09:22.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
