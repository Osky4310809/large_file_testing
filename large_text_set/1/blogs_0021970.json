However, Camp Quest is open to all kids and teens within the specified age range, and we work hard to create an environment in which all campers feel welcome. Our goal is to provide a place where campers can explore their developing worldviews and how to put their values into practice, ask questions, and make friends in an environment that is supportive of critical thinking and skepticism. \nRegistration is now open for campers. They’ll open the application process to potential staffers at the end of the month. \nAll the other details are right here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T04:17:39.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
