It has ample cushioning, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.\nAnother plus: The ear cups on this pair of headphones are large enough to accommodate my slightly-larger-than-average ears.\nThe over-ear pads can be switched out with on-ear ones that are included in the box. A major plus if you want a pair of headphones whose bulkiness can be changed on the fly.\nIf you look closer, you'll notice four indentations on the side of the right ear cup. More than just a simple design flair, these buttons are key to what makes the One Connect stand out.\nThey're touch-sensitive buttons that can be assigned different functions that you can select from MUZIK's eponymous app. When you pair these with your phone, a prompt pops up asking you to download the app so you can't miss it.\nThese functions can run the gamut from adjusting your volume, to tweeting out a Spotify link song you're listening to, or integrating with IFTTT (If This Than That). That last one is an online automation service, which opens up the possibilities of what can be done with a button press substantially.\nInstagram / @muzikconnect\nSome functions don't have to do with music at all; you can get the weather forecast, your next calendar event, or the battery level of both the headphones and your device.\nInstead of limiting functionality just those four buttons, MUZIK made the entire right ear cup is touch sensitive, complete with gesture support. Wiping up and down adjusts your volume, and swiping right and left changes the track you're listening to. Resting your hand on the earcup for a few seconds brings up Siri.\nIn my experience these buttons worked most of the time, and if you're the type of person who loves gadgets and customization, you're going to love these headphones. Overall, I found summoning Siri to be the gesture I liked most.\nIt's natural, and saved me from having to take my phone out if I wanted to change the song I was listening to or get a question answered.\nIn terms of technology, these headphones are the most advanced I've ever tried. When it comes to music playback, they're divisive.\nI'll be blunt. These are going to be love-it or hate-it depending on what you're looking for in a pair of headphones. They don't sound bad; in fact, they sound really good, but they have a very distinct sound profile that effects everything you listen to.\nInstagram / @muzikconnect\nTrying these out reminded me of when I reviewed a pair of \"extra bass\" headphones from Sony ; music sounded more bass-heavy, and that was the point. These headphones aren't extra bassy, but blend high, mid, and low frequencies together.\nThe result is music that sounds very good, but not super dynamic. All songs, regardless of genre, sounded somewhat similar. It was harder to pick out particular elements from a song the same way I could with other headphones.\nAgain, this comes down to your own personal preference; the way MUZIK's headphones present music makes it all sound rich, and full. More importantly, this presentation isn't fatiguing. I've found headphones that are too bass or treble heavy can't be worn for extended periods of time. That's not a problem here.\nYou could listen to music through these headphones all day without getting any ear fatigue.\nThere are better-sounding headphones out there for the One Connect's price, but MUZIK has packed their pair with more technology. It's a balance they've struck, and if you're looking for a pair of \"smart headphones,\" this is the pair I would recommend.\nMUZIK One Connect Smarter Headphone, $199.99 (originally $299.99), available at Amazon\nThis article was originally published on 12/15/2016.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
