Could   \nEven in the depths of what will forever be known as Jurgen’s Worst Week, Komedy Klopp put in a brief, welcome appearance. \n“The only good thing about this game is that it is over,” Liverpool’s boss said with a wry smile, after seeing his side crash out of the FA Cup in a week when the quest for silverware seems to have been postponed for another year. \nOne of the German’s many qualities as a manager is an ability to provide a sense of perspective, to both his players and his club’s supporters, with disarming comments. He knows when to defend (even if his side sometimes don’t), and when to be honest. \nHe saw his side taken apart by a devastating counter-attacking Wolves side. \nThe outstanding Richard Stearman put them ahead in the first minute and they added a second on the stroke of half time with a fine break finished by Andreas Weimann.

It was a bad game. It is not that I think that people have to stay and accept everything. It was not good enough,” he said. \n“It was a deserved win for Wolverhampton. Yet I take it like a game. Not more. It is always about winning football games and there is a next chance, (even if) it makes the pressure even more. \n“I cannot give the answers that maybe you want to hear. Everything is still ok – but not flying. If you look and feel like you do at this moment, it doesn’t make life better. \n“That is the impression of this game. I have nothing good to say about it. Absolutely nothing. But it is over. We will recover. It is necessary for all of us, mentally, and then we will focus on the next game.” Klopp was bitterly disappointed with his side's display (Photo: Liverpool Echo) Liverpool need a big response against Chelsea on Tuesday (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \nKlopp dismissed talk of a crisis, even if three Anfield defeats in seven days have proved almost fatal to Liverpool’s hopes of honours. \nHe accepts total responsibility for picking a team he thought could beat Wolves, but proved not fit for purpose. \nYet while his side’s form has so obviously dipped, he still believes they can turn things around achieve his main aim this season, which is to finish in the top four. Everyone, he said, needs to have faith in the bigger picture. \n“The only thing I know is that we need positive energy for the next games,” he added. \n“It is still deserved. The main part of the season was still really, really good – only nobody can remember any more. That is a personal issue. \n“I know it is a few weeks since we don’t fly anymore. Yet this is still a very good squad, even when everyone is thinking, “Oh my God!” I am still quite a good manager, even though we have lost the last three games.
