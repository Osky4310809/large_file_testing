Also Read: FBI Has 'No Information' to Support Trump's Wiretapping Claims \nNapolitano was absent from Fox News’ coverage of the confirmation hearings on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch on Monday and has been off the air since Thursday. \nPresident Donald Trump has in recent days cited Napolitano’s discredited claims in defense of his own unsubstantiated tweet from March 4 alleging that his predecessor had ordered his “wires tapped” in Trump Tower just before the election. \nThe accusation has since been debunked and the Trump administration has provided no evidence to substantiate the charge — or made any attempt to refute it. \nBut last week, Napolitano cited unnamed sources claiming that the British intelligence agency known as Government Communications Headquarters “most likely” provided Obama with transcripts of Trump’s recorded calls. Also Read: Fox News 'Knows of No Evidence' That Backs Up Trump's Wiretapping Claim (Video) \nGCHQ vehemently denied the claim and Fox anchors went as far as announcing on the air that the network’s news division could not corroborate Napolitano’s allegations. \n“Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-president of the United States was surveilled at any time, in any way,” anchor Shepard Smith told viewers Friday. \nOn Monday, FBI Director James Comey told Congress he had “no information” supporting Trump’s claims of wiretapping of the Republican candidate. 11 Times Fox News Hosts Criticized Donald Trump (Photos) \nIt's been known for a long time that Donald Trump is a fan of Fox News. And, in turn, the conservative network is a fan of his, often running positive stories about the administration that Trump then uses to fuel his Twitter feed . But Fox News isn't always on board the Trump Train. Here are 11 times Fox News gave Trump the business. \nMegyn Kelly calls Trump out on women Trump famously feuded former anchor Kelly after she asked him a tough question at a Republican primary debate about derogatory statements he's made about women. Trump took it personally, judging by his response on Twitter and in interviews. He later famously said Kelly must have had \"blood coming out of her wherever\" regarding the question. Watch the debate question here . \nKelly to Trump: \"Facts matter\" Trump kept hammering at Kelly on Twitter and elsewhere. When he called her out for not using the IBT poll when he was leading the Republican primary field, Kelly rebuked him with a tweet showing she did use the poll. \"Facts matter,\" she wrote. \nFox mocks Trump with statement on debate skipping poll After polled his Twitter followers to see if he should drop out of a Fox-hosted Republican primary debate, Fox responded artfully with a sarcastic statement that it had learned from \"secret\" sources Trump might be treated unfairly as president by foreign leaders. \nBill O'Reilly calls out Trump's tweet with totally wrong stats \"The O'Reilly Factor\" grilled Trump in a Nov. 2015 interview about his tweet that erroneously said black people killed whites at a rate of 81 percent, while whites kill blacks at a rate of 15 percent. O'Reilly told Trump, \"You shouldn't tweet.\" Trump did not take that advice. \nShepard Smith backs CNN on Russia reporting Anchor Shep Smith was on Team CNN after Trump's January press conference , in which he refused to take a question from CNN's Jim Acosta, saying, \"You're fake news.\" Smith said, \"neither they (CNN) nor any other journalists should be subjected to belittling or delegitimizing by the president-elect of the United States.\" Watch it here . \nChris Wallace bucks Trump calling media \"enemy of the public\" After his press conference in January 2017, Trump continued his attack on media he doesn't like on Twitter. Anchor Chris Wallace wasn't having it on \"Fox & Friends.\" Wallace said Trump's comments \"crossed an important line\" and said they were dangerous. \nSmith calls Trump out on terrorism lie Smith isn't a fan of Trump's false assertions. When Trump said the media \"doesn't want to report\" terrorist attacks , Smith took him to task. \"The White House knows that it was false or could have learned that it was false with a quick Google check, but either did not do so or decided not to tell the truth.” Watch it here . \nWallace says the media is too easy on Trump In an interview with TheWrap , Wallace said he thinks Sunday political shows in particular should be tougher on Trump. \"I think if anything, the media has treated him too well. By that I mean they’ve allowed him to play by different rules.\" Read the full interview . \nO'Reilly tells Trump Putin is \"a killer\" In a February interview, O'Reilly brought up Trump's apparent refusal to criticize Vladimir Putin, calling the Russian president \"a killer.\" Trump famously responded by saying, \"What, you think our country is so innocent?\" Watch it here . \nSmith wails on Trump's refusal to talk about Russia hacks Nobody on Fox hits Trump harder than Shep Smith. \"We have a right to know… You call us ‘fake news’ and put us down like children for asking questions on behalf of the American people.\" Watch it here . \nSmith backs CNN and rebukes Trump's 'fake news' assertion Trump's favorite insult against media he doesn't like is to call it \"fake news.\" But Shep Smith again supported CNN against the president after Trump's anti-media speech to the Conservative Political Action Committee.
