That tweet is gone however because Twitter quickly shut down that new account too.\nIn a release sent out to media organizations , Twitter Indonesia did not explain exactly what FPI did to have their accounts suspended but stated more generally: \"In order to create a sense of security and comfort for users on Twitter, we can suspend accounts that violate the rules of Twitter. Account suspensions occur based on reports we receive from users through our procedures for reporting violations”. \nPerhaps realizing that they couldn’t circumvent Twitter’s terms of service simply by making new accounts, it seems FPI decided to try a different tactic - by calling for a boycott Twitter altogether.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T06:10:32.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
