By Steve Twedt / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nFinancially-troubled Ellwood City Hospital has been acquired by Americore Health, LLC, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based privately held company formed just a year ago that specializes in acquiring and managing rural hospitals. \nIn a brief phone conversation Tuesday, Americore Health CEO Grant White said Ellwood City Hospital, in Lawrence County, will continue to function as an acute care hospital, with plans for adding services and opening up new revenue streams. \nHe declined to give specifics regarding staffing or disclose terms of the deal that was more than six months in the making. \nThe partnership represents a lifeline for the 104-year-old Lawrence County hospital, which had been operating in the red for nearly 20 years. \nThree years ago, hospital officials were forced to lay off 67 employees as a cost-cutting measure. \nAfter UPMC’s purchase of nearby Jameson Hospital last year, Ellwood City CEO Carolyn Izzo said the hospital needed to find a partner as well. Ms. Izzo said the board reviewed five different proposals before deciding on Americore Health. \n“A lot of people will be breathing a sigh of relief tonight,” she said Tuesday. \nShe said the two parties have actually signed two agreements, one an interim management agreement that will allow Americore Health to immediately begin instituting programs, and a second asset acquisition agreement that will require state regulatory approval. \nThe hospital currently has about 400 employees. \nSteve Twedt: or 412-263-1963.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:09:49.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
