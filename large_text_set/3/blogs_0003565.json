The story here is Barack Obama’s agenda has been totally reputed (sic) by the American people. It has been rejected in 2010. It was rejected in 2012. It was rejected in 2016. It was sent packing,” he said.   \nHe’s right, too. Obama’s agenda was a categorical failure, and Obama’s mad about it. \n“The story here is that Barack Obama is humiliated and angry and embarrassed that his effort to transform the United States of America into some kind of socialist paradise has been interrupted, that he was the architect of the Democrat Party defeat,” Limbaugh said. “And that cannot stand for the history books!” \n“And so this story is all about the Democrat Party trying to rewrite history and make it look like they actually won were it not for the cheating of the Russians and Trump,” he added. \nOf course they’re the “legitimate” winners. They had to have been cheated, right? How else could America have rejected socialism?
