The Alpinestars medical unit helped Roczen off the track following the incident. Dungey now leads the points heading into Glendale. MAJOR Championship implications as points leader @KenRoczen94 goes down HARD. #SXonFOX https://t.co/c8DSlQqU15 \n— FS1 (@FS1) January 22, 2017 \nAfter a rough start to the season, Cooper Webb took the holeshot for the 450SX Main Event. However, Dungey then took the lead into Turn 2 despite having performed poorly in the lead up to the Main. \nHe had crashed in the first turn of his heat race and only made it into the main with a third-place finish in the Semi. \nDungey was followed home across the line by his Red Bull KTM teammate Marvin Musquin, while Honda rider Cole Seely rounded out the podium in third. Seely himself had had an impressive race, running in second place ahead of Roczen before the latter had his incident. Seely only lost his second when Musquin went by, and he was able to hold on to his podium spot ahead of Webb and Weston Peick. \nOne rider absent from the Main Event was Jason Anderson, who had been involved in an altercation following an in-race collision with Vince Friese during their heat race.

Austin Forkner, who was running with a stiffer suspension this week, had had a much stronger night and took the holeshot during the main event as well as his heat win. Forkner placed fourth in the main ahead of Martin Davalos, who rounded out the top five. \nUnofficial 450SX results:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T08:16:53.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
