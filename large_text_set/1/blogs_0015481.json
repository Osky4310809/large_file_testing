He is more concerned about fixing the country’s biting economic and security conditions and other challenges than saving his job as the Deputy President of the Senate. \n“It is his view that Nigeria has to first exist for us to have political parties to belong to or political offices to occupy. Studies have shown a direct relationship between economic conditions and survival of democracy. \n“The primary responsibility our Constitution places on our government is to cater to the wellbeing of the citizens as well as security of their lives and property. When such are threatened, everyone should necessarily get serious and preoccupied with contributing his or her quota to salvaging the country. \n“Besides, he is most grateful to his colleagues for the confidence they continue to repose in him and the Senate President, Senator Bukola Saraki. He is grateful for the solidarity that the Senators have continued to accord them.” \nOzoani, while appreciating Ekweremadu’s supporters and well meaning Nigerians who were agitated by the reports that there was no cause for alarm. He urged them to continue to pray for the Senate leadership, the Senate, the National Assembly, and the government and the entire nation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T12:35:00.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
