Since the post, several other women, some anonymous, others not, have opened up about their experiences at TVF, in particular with Arunabh. \nMany others have spoken exclusively to The Quint , and shared their alleged harrowing experiences with Arunabh. One of these women is his neighbour. \"One day, I was talking on the phone and walking outside the studio when Arunabh spotted me and called me. I looked at him, just smiled, and he gestured me to walk to him. Out of nowhere, he started telling me that he had just come back from some place in Ratnagiri, and brought mangoes. He asked me if I liked mangoes and while his mouth spoke those words, his hands slid down my back, from neck to waist. I'm not someone who gets scared easily, I wasn't scared, I just knew his intentions. I moved away from him, stared and said a \"NO\" and walked off. I should have punched him, but I didn't.\" \nThe accusations are serious. But, TVF's response, instead of acknowledging the gravity of the situation, gives the message: SHUT THE F*** UP! \nMany team members are also individually speaking up on social media about the speciousness of the claims. Although, as more information comes out indicating that TVF culture is not exactly respectful to women, we will not comment on the truth or falsity of the accusations. Although we will say, that for these women to share these stories take a lot of courage, as they are now, expectedly, in the middle of a maelstrom. \nBut, the question arises: Why was the default response to shut the woman up and bring her to \"severe justice for making such false allegations\" instead of investigating the matter? \nWhy is it that TVF has not asked Arunabh to step down from his role in the company until this issue is resolved? Why is it that nobody who works at the company is demanding an investigation? Sure, if the Indian Fowler's post on Medium was an isolated account, it might have been baseless. But, even that does not justify such a callous response from the company. \nTVF's response is authored to instil fear - not just in Indian Fowler, the woman who was brave enough to start a dialogue about this, but in all women. The message here is - If you even so much as hint at the injustices done against you by a man in power, you will automatically, without the courtesy of an inquiry, be labelled a defamatory liar.
