By: FE Online | Published: March 4, 2017 12:49 PM RJ Naved asked Virender Sehwag, Gurmehar Kaur and others to stop wasting paper. (Source: Screenshot) \nRadio Mirchi’s RJ Naved who is famous for his pranks on the radio station, made a YouTube video to send across a message to Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur and former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag who were involved in an ugly banter involving ‘nationalism’ last week. While most celebrities like Randeep Hooda, Javed Akhtar and Babita Phogat had an aggressive stand on the issue, Naved took his usual funny side and asked people to spread love and not hate. \nHe requested Virender Sehwag, Gurmehar Kaur, nationalists in the country, anti-nationals and those who should go to Pakistan, to not waste paper on writing messages that lead to agitation among people and cause controversies. Naved’s video was similar to that of Gurmehar where he wrote his message on papers. He said, “If we will save paper, we will be able to save humans and only then nationals and anti-nationals will survive. So, don’t fight among each other.” Towards the end of the video, he also revealed that papers used by him were used ones. \nWatch RJ Naved’s video here: \nGurmehar Kaur shot to limelight when a video of her holding a placard which said that Pakistan did not kill her father, War did, went viral. The matter sparked controversy when cricketing legend Virender Sehwag and Olympic silver medalist, wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt trolled her on Twitter. The matter had become a national headline within a span of hours, following which Kaur had received threats of rape and death of Facebook and Twitter and had taken herself out of the protests. \nThe Financial Express Online spoke to Gurmehar Kaur and asked her opinion on the issue. While she was unwilling to make any statement per se, she refused to take any credit for her role in the movement. She said, “It’s not just my campaign, it’s a students’ campaign, I just happened to start it, people who believe in it will take it forward and are taking it forward.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T19:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T09:31:04.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
