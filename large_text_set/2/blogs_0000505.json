The tech giant has recently announced that it will launch Samsung Pay Mini sometime during the first quarter of the year. The new service allows users to make online purchases with the help of a dedicated app. It will work on all smartphones that run Android 5.0 Lollipop or above and sport at least an HD screen — 1280 x 720 pixels.\nSamsung Pay Mini will first be released in South Korea and might eventually make its way to other countries as well. The company said that it is considering expanding the service, but did not provide any additional information regarding the topic. Before it officially launches the service, Samsung will first test it out with a pre-launch trial that’s scheduled to kick off on February 6.\nSee also: Android Pay vs Apple Pay vs Samsung Pay Overview April 27, 2016 The newly announced service will coexist with Samsung Pay , which enables users to pay for goods and services in stores using their smartphone. Unlike Samsung Pay Mini, Samsung Pay is currently only compatible with the company’s Galaxy series of smartphones. Samsung has said it will release Samsung Pay for non-Samsung devices “eventually”.\nMobile payment services are becoming increasingly popular among consumers. They have the potential of becoming big business for companies like Samsung and others that are offering similar services but have to first make their way to more markets across the globe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:18:47.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
