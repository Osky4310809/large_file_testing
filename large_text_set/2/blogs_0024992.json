The neighborhood is home to a variety of housing stock and many old buildings with character. In December, we featured this house on Lakewood that had just been restored by the Michigan Historic Preservation Network and the Detroit Preservation Demonstration Project. It listed for $130,000 and sold for the asking price. Our friends at MHPN tell us that the house went to a family that attended an open house for it the first day it was on the market. The new owner’s family grew up in the neighborhood and she was happy to find a house there. MHPN is currently working with the Land Bank to secure another house nearby to restore. This sweet house is 1,500 square feet, with three bedrooms, one and a half baths, and a spacious kitchen. For before/after slider pics, check out the original post . Here’s another look inside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:52:03.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
