Jo-Ann Petinglay, Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) spokesperson. \nThe two were among five Malaysians taken from a tugboat off the waters of Lahad Datu in Sabah on July 19. \nMaj. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., Westmincom chief, said the bandits abandoned their captives at the height of a military offensive. \nGalvez said they launched the operation after being tipped off that around 30 bandits led by Alhabsy Misaya are keeping the two Malaysians in the area. \nThe victims were brought to a military hospital at Camp Teodulfo Bautista for checkup and treatment.   \n“The victims are both weak and sick,” Galvez, said citing reports from Col. Cirilito Sobejana of JTFS. \nMilitary operations are ongoing to rescue the remaining hostages. The Abu Sayyaf is still holding 11 Vietnamese, a Dutch man, a Korean, seven Indonesians, three Malaysians and eight Filipinos. 4 crewmen seized \nSeveral hours after the Malaysians were rescued, unidentified men hijacked a cargo vessel and took four crewmembers off the waters of Basilan. \nTwo of the victims were identified as Aurelio Agacac and Laurencio Tiro, captain and chief engineer, respectively, of Super Shuttle Ro-Ro 9 , a vessel of Panamanian registry. \nLt. Cmdr Alvin Dagalea of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said the cargo ship was on its way to General Santos City when it was intercepted some 19 nautical miles southeast of Sibagu island at around noon. \nDagalea said a PCG gunboat was deployed to secure the vessel while pursuit operations for the kidnappers are ongoing. \nThere was no immediate report regarding the group responsible for the attack. – With Jaime Laude, Evelyn Macairan, Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:14:20.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
