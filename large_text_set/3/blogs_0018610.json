Read on to learn more about the new features coming in our latest patch, including The Armory, Primal Ancients, and numerous quality of life updates. The Armory \nWe’re happy to present a long-awaited feature we know you’ve been eager to get your hands on! The Armory enables players to store up to five complete character builds on each character, allowing you to swap seamlessly between set items, skills, runes, and gems with the click of a button. \nAny items equipped via the Armory will automatically swap to wherever the exchanged equipment was stored—whether that’s back into your stash or your personal inventory. Gems and Legendary Gems will also swap and, if you ‘ve upgraded or leveled up your gems, the Armory will automatically select the highest quality or level available for that gem type. Lastly, your skill bar will also update to your selected skills, rune, and Kanai’s Cube power preferences, and you’re welcome to name your setups whatever you like! \nAs a note, the Armory does not store Paragon points, so you’ll need to redistribute those if you have a preference with your build. However, we’ve added a new hotkey to use your points more efficiently. While you can still spend 10 points at a time by holding Shift and clicking, you can now spend them 100 points at a time by holding Ctrl and clicking! Spend those points like your life depends on it! Crafting Materials UI \nSifting through your crafting materials in your stash is a thing of the past! All crafting materials including Arcane Dust, Veiled Crystals, Reusable Parts, Death’s Breaths, bounty crafting materials, and Hellfire crafting materials are stored in a convenient, separate UI tab. Just click the small anvil located next to your gold total in your inventory screen to view your materials. \nAll crafting materials will be moved automatically into the Crafting Materials tab upon the launch of Patch 2.5.0, so there’s no need to store them somewhere specific before the patch hits. When using your crafting materials at Kanai’s Cube, there is now a convenient new Fill button to automagically transport your items directly into the cube interface for transmuting. Adventure Mode Updates \nSeveral additional changes are coming to Adventure Mode, from iterating on Greater Rift changes that were made in Patch 2.4.3 to quality of life updates coming for Bounties and Horadric Caches. \nFirst, the frequency of several different tile sets in Greater Rifts has been adjusted. Many of the more frequent areas, like various caves and Keep Depths, have had their appearance rate reduced. On the flip side, wide open areas that were previously rarer, like Festering Woods or Stinging Winds, have had their appearance rate increased. This should, overall, result in a more varied environmental experience in Greater Rifts. W de open sp ces, ye h. \nIn addition, bonus acts in Bounties are being removed. Bonus Caches previously granted by the old system have instead been combined with the base Horadric Cache to form Large Horadric Chests. These are granted after completing a full set of five Bounties in any one Act and hold the total amount of materials and loot that previously would have been contained in the two separate caches. Now, you can complete whichever Acts you prefer in any order and at your leisure without feeling like every game session needs to be at least twenty-five Bounties long. Primal Ancients \nPlayers have different goals from Season to Season or game session to game session, and for some of our more dedicated players, there wasn’t a clear progression track beyond augmenting your Ancient Legendary items or completing the Season Journey. Enter Primal Ancients, a new tier of very rare Ancient items that allow you to aim for that perfect set of gear. \nPrimal Ancients are Ancient items with perfectly rolled affixes. This means every affix including Primary, Secondary, and Legendary are at their ideal value, whether that means the maximum or minimum value. While the items don’t try to guess what kind of affixes are perfect for your build, you can be certain that they will roll with a couple specific rules. First, they will always drop with the appropriate main stat for your class (Strength for Barbarian/Crusader, Dexterity for Demon Hunter/Monk, and Intelligence for Witch Doctor/Wizard). Second, they will always have the ideal number of sockets for that item. For pants, chests, helms, and jewelry, this means the maximum number of sockets. Since ideally you will want to use a Ramaladni's Gift on your weapon, Primal weapons will roll with no sockets. \nPrimal Ancients can drop from any source of Legendary item in the game, including Horadric Caches, Kadala, and Kanai’s Cube, but only after you have completed at least a level 70 Greater Rift. This requirement need only be completed once per game mode (Hardcore vs. Non-Hardcore, or Seasonal vs. Non-Seasonal), which means it will reset with every Season. However, once that requirement has been met, all characters in that game mode will benefit from it. Happy hunting! \nPatch 2.5.0 is almost here! Which new feature are you looking forward to the most?
