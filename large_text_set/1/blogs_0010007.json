(AP Photo/Jon Elswick, File) Obamacare marketplaces healthy, White House says By Robert King • 1/10/17 1:26 PM Robert King Healthcare Correspondent The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/King-3.jpg More \nThe Obama administration released a new report Tuesday aimed at highlighting the stability of Obamacare's marketplaces, seeking to undercut a key Republican attack as they look to repeal the healthcare law. \nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers released the report Tuesday that examines the effects of 2017 premium increases on individual market enrollment and the risk pool. \nThe council said that continued signups on the individual market, which is for people who don't get insurance through their job and is made of Obamacare's exchanges, show that premium increases aren't hampering enrollment. The administration announced Tuesday that signups in all 50 states and the District of Columbia surged past 11 million. \n\"There is no evidence that claims costs in the reformed individual market are growing particularly rapidly,\" the brief said. \"Indeed, data on claims in the [Affordable Care Act] — compliant market indicate that claims growth from 2014 to 2015 was slower than claims growth in private insurance overall.\" \n  \nThe brief comes as some Obamacare customers are wrangling with premium increases of up to 70 percent in some states. The administration pegged premiums to increase by 22 percent on average for the second-cheapest silver plan, the most popular Obamacare option. \nThe White House said that the higher premium increases in 2017, which are the source of Republican attacks, are a one-time market correction. \nThe factors that led to the high premiums this year include underpricing in the initial year of the new marketplace and the failure of premium increases in 2015 and 2016 to mitigate the phasedown of the law's reinsurance program, which is intended to help buttress insurers against major losses. \nThe program and a similar one called \"risk corridors\" expired in 2016. \nThe White House is also optimistic that premiums will \"return to a sustainable level\" in 2018.
