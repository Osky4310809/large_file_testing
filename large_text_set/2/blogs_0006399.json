Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017\nWith the help of SocialRank , a software for identifying audiences on Twitter and Instagram, here's just some of what we know:\nTrump has 24.1 million Twitter followers on his personal account @realDonaldTrump. That's quite a lot, although he's nowhere near first place: Katy Perry has more than 95.7 million followers, Justin Bieber has more than 91.6 million, and Barack Obama has more than 84.2 million.\nBut a closer look at the 24.1 million people who chose to follow Trump on Twitter show something interesting: More than 5 million accounts have egg avatars, meaning they haven't changed their picture since joining Twitter. That's 20 percent of his following.\nArmies of Twitter Eggs\nCreate bar charts\nComparatively:\nObama's old account @POTUS44 had 2.5 million eggs out of 15 million followers (17 percent)\n...and Hillary Clinton's @HillaryClinton has 2.1 million out of 13 million (16 percent).\nIn conclusion, Trump wins for most number of eggs and highest ratio.\nTrump's army of eggs\nImage: screenshot/twitter\nAlso:\n4,785,901 of Trump's followers have never actually tweeted, themselves\nSince Trump's been in office, only 6,478,764 of his 24.1 million followers have tweeted.\nFor those followers who do tweet:\n488,172 accounts have used the hashtag #MAGA (Make America Great Again)\n...and 75,291 accounts have used the hashtag #TheBachelor.\nOut of his 24.1 million followers:\n118,629 live in New York City\n518,603 live in California\n148,160 live in Mexico\nand 26,535 live in Russia.\nOf those international accounts, an estimated 223,729 accounts have tweeted in Russian, and 1,125,261 have tweeted in Spanish.\nLooking at the devices, more than 98,354 tweet from a Blackberry phone, while 7,742,358 tweet on iOS.\nAlso, about 167,446 accounts have used the frog emoji—a hallmark of alt-right Twitter, or just a fascinating mass of frog emoji fetishists.
