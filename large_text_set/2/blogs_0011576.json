REX/Shutterstock \nOn Monday night, he was seen on the runway for designer Philipp Plein. \nIn the front row for his big show was Kylie Jenner , Paris Hilton and Madonna at New York Fashion Week. \nMeeks, whose mugshot was released by California police on Facebook in 2014, quickly gained attention thanks to his clear, blue eyes, high cheekbones and teardrop tattoo. \nHe served 2 years in jail, but now he’s just straight-up serving FACE on the runway. REX/Shutterstock \nMeek, who has three children and a wife, shared his first modeling photos on Instagram in June. \nThe 33-year-old, who is also called “The Blue Eyed Bandit” for stealing so many hearts and “Jail Bae,” has found God since his release in prison. \nGranted, if I were arrested for gang related charges and ended up with a modeling career afterward, I would start believe in God, too. \nMeeks went from orange jumpsuits and a jail cell to high fashion, a mansion and a $150,000 sports car, a Maserati, which he was unable to drive due to being on house arrest. \nJoining a gang, being arrested multiple times and having your mugshot go viral has got to be one of the weirdest routes to becoming a model. \nAnd to think the only thing my mugshot got me was the perfect Christmas card. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
