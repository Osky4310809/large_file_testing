The arrest came after authorities received a tip through Crime Stoppers about a video publicly posted online of the alleged sex act, according to Lamar County Sheriff’s Office. \nIt has not been determined who posted the video to social media.\n“We were able to download pictures from that website that depicted the incident and through the investigation, we were able to identify that it was her,” Sheriff Danny Rigel told The Post.\nAuthorities then obtained a search warrant for Graves’ home in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where she was arrested.\n“We determined that residence was where the film had been made,” Rigel said.\nGraves is being held in Lamar County Jail, where she awaits to be arraigned. If convicted, Graves faces up to 10 years in jail and would have to register as a sex offender.\nThe large mixed-breed dog was placed in the care of a relative.\nAccording to Rigel, such cases are rare in the south Mississippi town.\n“I’ve been doing this for 35 years and this is the first I’ve ever prosecuted for this particular crime,” he said.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:22:27.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
