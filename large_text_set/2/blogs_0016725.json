It shows just how timeless great music is. There is something here for the grandparents, the parents, and the kids so it's definitely a crowd pleaser of an album. The remakes of the old songs were done very well, providing a nice update for 2016. The songs and the lyrics give listeners a true picture of what type of characters we will encounter when the Trolls movie finally comes out. Looking forward to seeing the movie with my 2 year old and 7 year old. As a teenager of yesteryear, it was all about those Trolls! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Job well done on putting together the soundtrack, JT! Album is freaking awesome", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:34:35.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
