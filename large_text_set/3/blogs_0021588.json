Shares \nYou spend a lot more time planetside in Mass Effect: Andromeda than other games in the series, but your ship, the Tempest, is still important. It's a lot smaller than the various incarnations of Shepard's Normandy, but squeezes a lot into its relatively slight frame. It's a scout ship, designed to quickly travel between systems, and runs on a skeleton crew. You won't see random crew members wandering around; just your small, trusted team. This makes it feel a lot less busy than the Normandy, but also more intimate. \nA new Nvidia driver added Ansel support for the game, a tool that lets you output ludicrously high resolution screenshots and move the camera around freely. So I thought I'd use it to explore and document the Tempest. Of course, if you'd rather explore the place for yourself when the game comes out in a couple of days, click away now. But if you aren't bothered, enjoy some 4K images of the ship.
