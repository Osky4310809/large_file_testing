Ollivander was widely considered the best wandmaker in the world, and many wizards and witches buy their wands from him. \nIn 1996 , Ollivander was captured and tortured by Lord Voldemort . He was rescued in 1998 by Harry Potter , Ron Weasley , Hermione Granger , and Dobby . He imparted important information regarding wandlore to Harry, that helped him in his understanding of the Deathly Hallows . Contents Biography Family linage \nThe family of Ollivander has long been associated with the mysterious profession of wandcraft . It is said that the name means 'he who owns the olive wand', which suggests that the original Ollivander arrived in Britain from a Mediterranean country (olive trees not being native to the UK). Mr Ollivander himself believes that his earliest forebears in this country arrived with the Romans, and set up stall (subsequently shop) to sell to ancient British wizards whose wands were crude of construction and unreliable in performance. Early life \nHe attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth, where he was sorted into Ravenclaw House . [1] Career as a wandmaker \" Renowned wandmaker Mr Ollivander owns the wand shop Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands Since 382 BC in Diagon Alley. His shop is widely considered the best place to purchase a wand. \" —Ollivander's Introduction [src] \nOllivander grew up in the family business, and showed precocious talent in wandmaking . Soon, he developed an ambition to improve upon the cores and wand woods he made and developed a determination to pursue the ideal wand. [1] \nBefore Garrick Ollivander's proprietorship of Ollivanders , wizards used a wide variety of wand cores; the customer would often present their wandmaker with a magical substance to which they were attached, and he would turn it into their wand core. [1] Mr Ollivander, however, maintained that doing so altered the wand's temperament, [5] and revolutionised the way wands were crafted by having cores of immensely powerful magical substances expertly enclosed in specially selected and complementary wandwoods , the result to be matched to an owner with whom the wand itself felt the most affinity. [1] \nWhile there was initially substantial resistance to this new way wands were made, it soon became clear that wands made by Ollivander were far superior to any others. His methods of locating wand woods and core substances, marrying them together, and matching them to ideal owners were all jealously guarded secrets that were coveted by rival wandmakers. [1] \nSometime into his career, in the summer of 1938 , Ollivander sold Tom Riddle his wand . Harry Potter's wand \" Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great. \" —Ollivander to Harry regarding his wand [src] Mr Ollivander presents Harry Potter with his first wand \nOllivander supplied Harry Potter with a wand , and as he did so, he told Harry a few facts about wands. He explained that a wand has a core , in Harry's case a phoenix feather . He told Harry that the body of the wand is made from a choice of different woods with different magical properties. Ollivander said he made a similar wand using another feather from the same phoenix , but using a different wood. Harry's wand is holly, which symbolises protection, rather than Voldemort's yew, which is symbolic of death. He also explained that the wand chooses the wizard, rather than the other way around. Immediately after Harry left the shop, Ollivander sent a letter to Albus Dumbledore informing him of the wand's sale. 1994-1995 Triwizard Tournament \" May I introduce Mr Ollivander? He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament. \" \nAs a very recognised wandmaker, Ollivander was asked to inspect the wands of the champions in the 1994-1995 Triwizard Tournament before the competition started, to make sure they were all working properly. Second Wizarding War Attempted robbery of his shop \nIn 1996 , Alexandra Walker attempted to rob Ollivanders . She could not, however, and she was arrested. This event made Daily Prophet headlines. Kidnapped by Death Eaters Arthur Weasley : \" Shop's empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped. \" Ginny Weasley : \" But what'll people do for wands? \" Remus Lupin : \" They'll make do with other makers. But Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got him it's not so good for us. \" — News of the kidnappings of Ollivander and Florean Fortescue [src] Fenrir Greyback and other Death Eaters kidnap Ollivander from outside of his shop \nIn 1996 Ollivander was kidnapped by Voldemort 's Death Eaters , leaving behind an empty, locked up shop and no signs of a struggle. It is believed that the last wand he sold was to Neville Longbottom . It was later revealed that Ollivander was captured by Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters and was held prisoner at Malfoy Manor, where he was forced to make a new wand for Peter Pettigrew . He was tortured by Lord Voldemort for information regarding the twin cores of Harry Potter 's wand and his own. Ollivander told him that he merely needed to use a wand other than his own to face Harry Potter. Ollivander is tortured at Malfoy Manor \nAfter using Lucius Malfoy 's wand and seeing its destruction when faced with Harry Potter and his Phoenix wand, Voldemort rounded on Ollivander for an explanation of why Harry's wand acted as it had. Although he had no answer to give since no wandmaker had ever witnessed such an event, Ollivander was tortured again by Lord Voldemort and questioned about the most powerful wand in existence, the Elder Wand . Skirmish at Malfoy Manor and escape Main article: Skirmish at Malfoy Manor Ollivander and Luna are saved from Malfoy Manor by Dobby the house-elf \nHarry Potter, his friends, and Dean Thomas and Griphook, were later captured and taken to Malfoy Manor , where they were reunited with Mr Ollivander and Luna Lovegood . Ollivander and the others were subsequently rescued by Dobby the house-elf in the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor . Mr Ollivander seemed to bond with Luna during their captivity together, and thanked her for being \"an inexpressible comfort [to him] in that terrible place\" . Stay at Shell Cottage \" The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eye seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton \" —Description of Ollivander's mistreatment in Malfoy Manor [src] Ollivander at Shell Cottage after being rescued from Malfoy Manor explaining the Deathly Hallows to Harry Potter \nOllivander was taken to Shell Cottage , where he recovered from months of imprisonment and torture, and then departed to Muriel 's house, where he remained in hiding for the rest of the war. He later created and sent a new wand to Luna Lovegood , in 1998. While a Shell Cottage he was interrogated by Harry Potter who wanted to know information about the Elder Wand that Voldemort was so obsessively searching for and to have a better understanding of the unique connection that existed between his wand and Voldemort's. Study of the Elder Wand Harry Potter : \" You told You-Know-Who knew that Gregorovitch had the wand? \" Ollivander : \" It was a rumour. A rumour, years and years ago, long before you were born. I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it would be for business; that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand! \" — Harry and Ollivander discuss the Elder Wand and the Deathly Hallows [src] \nAs with other wandmakers, Ollivander makes it his business to study the mystifying Elder Wand in depth, such as its history and distinctive characteristics. Unlike Hermione Granger , he believed that the Elder Wand was not a myth or tale, and showed great enthusiasm with the powerful object despite the fact that it was dangerous and has had a bloody history. When held captive by Lord Voldemort, he was forced to relate all information he had known about the powerful wand. He also revealed that the last person rumoured to own the wand was Gregorovitch , a foreign wandmaker, though he did not believe the rumour and thought that Gregorovitch spread it to boost his business Physical appearance \nWhen first meeting him, Harry Potter described Garrick Ollivander as an old man with pale silver eyes. Personality and traits \" Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great. \" —Ollivander expressing his interest in what powerful wizards can do with wands [src] Ollivander and his many wands \nOllivander was an intelligent man, with an excellent memory when it came to his work; he remembered the details of every wand he ever sold. He seemed to become happier the more difficult the challenge to find exactly the right wand for a difficult customer was. He used a magical tape measure to help assess customers for their wand. \nOllivander had a professorial enthusiasm for wandlore and was immensely learned in it. A less savoury aspect of his personality was that his fascination with wandlore sometimes eclipsed his sense of right and wrong; he was so fascinated with what a powerful wizard can do when matched with the right wand that he became detached from the good or evil nature of their actions. A prime example of this would be Tom Riddle , also known as Lord Voldemort. Even after the First Wizarding War , Ollivander remembered him as having done \"great things\" with his wand — \" Terrible, yes, but great \". An even more extreme example was during the Second Wizarding War , when Ollivander, having just been rescued from a year of imprisonment and torture at Voldemort's hands, was briefly enthralled by the thought of what Voldemort might do when matched with the Elder Wand . \nHowever, Ollivander still valued his own life and well-being, and divulged information to Voldemort whenever threatened with death and tortured by the Cruciatus Curse. The wandmaker feared the Dark Lord's wrath and begged for mercy when informed that his (Ollivander's) advice about using another wand was incorrect. Magical abilities and skills Wandmaker : Garrick Ollivander, just as other Ollivander family members, was considered as the best British wandmaker. Non-verbal magic : Ollivander may have had the ability to perform non-verbal spells, as no incantation was mentioned when he conjured smoke rings in 1994. Apparition : He could Apparate, but failed in 1998 at Malfoy Manor due to enchantments placed on the cellar. Transfiguration : He is skilled with conjuration, a difficult branch of transfiguration, conjuring flowers , birds , smoke rings, and wine in 1994. Duelling : It is quite reasonable to say that Ollivander was a skilled duellist in his time due to his ability in wandlore and ability to identify spells easily. His knowledge of Wandlore would also have assisted him as he is familiar with the weaknesses and strengths of different wands. Wand versatility : In 1994 , Ollivander used Cedric's, Fleur's, Viktor's and Harry's wands, each with successful effect. Relationships \" I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you, Mr Potter. \" —Ollivander to Harry during their first meeting [src] \nLike most of the wizarding world, Ollivander heard of Harry and his defeat of Lord Voldemort in 1981. He first met Harry in 1991 and sold him his wand . The phoenix feather in Harry's and Riddle's wands came from the same phoenix, Fawkes , something that Ollivander considered \"curious\". \nOllivander's relationship with Harry Potter grew after the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor when Harry rescued him from imprisonment and during their subsequent stay at the Shell Cottage . Harry would go on to obtain vital information about the Elder Wand from Ollivander, which would later prove instrumental for bringing about the final defeat of Lord Voldemort. Luna Lovegood Luna Lovegood : \" I'm going to miss you, Mr Ollivander. \" Ollivander : \" And I you, my dear. You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place . \" — Luna says goodbye to Mr Ollivander [src] \nOllivander also developed a close relationship with Luna Lovegood , for she was a comfort to him during their imprisonment in Malfoy Manor. Ollivander later repaid her kindness by creating a new wand for her. Lord Voldemort \" He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse , I — I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed — \" —Ollivander regarding how Voldemort tortured him to procure information about the Elder Wand [src] \nOllivander was afraid of Lord Voldemort , and referred to him as \"You-Know-Who\" like almost all other wizards. He was kidnapped by Death Eaters and tortured by Voldemort for information about Voldemort's wand's relationship with Harry's wand.
