According to People , the Los Angeles Police Department paid a visit to Simmons' home this week for a welfare check due to growing concerns over his safety, and that he appears to be \"perfectly fine.\" “ There was something about his housekeeper holding him hostage and not allowing people to see him and preventing him from making phone calls and it was all garbage and that’s why we went out to see him. None of it is true,” Detective Kevin Becker told People . “The fact of the matter is we went out and talked to him, he is fine, nobody is holding him hostage. He is doing exactly what he wants to do. If he wants to go out in public or see anybody he will do that.” “He is perfectly fine and he is very happy,\" he continued. \"I don’t know what he is going to do, but right now he is doing what he wants to do and it is his business.” The detective went on to add that Simmons \"couldn't have been nicer\" to the LAPD during their visit, and that some of the more outlandish rumors from Missing Richard Simmons don't appear to be based in reality. As previously reported , Simmons mysteriously stopped making public appearances and teaching classes in early 2014, and hasn't been seen since. Meanwhile, his longtime rep, Tom Estey, has repeatedly stated that the fitness legend is simply taking a much-deserved break, and that he's perfectly safe.
