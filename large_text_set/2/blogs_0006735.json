Borders Camp at NBA All-Star Weekend. \nThe event, held annually, will feature 67 boys and girls from 32 countries and territories as they descend onto New Orleans to compete in the third instalment of the camp. \nNBA players and coaches will be on hand to tutor the players throughout the camp, which will be held from February 17-19 at the New Orleans Pelicans’ training facility. \nAustralian centre, Thon Maker, is among the players who will coach the up-and-coming prospects, as well as Cheick Diallo (New Orleans Pelicans), Wayne Ellington (Miami Heat), Justin Holiday (New York Knicks), Meyers Leonard (Portland Trail Blazers), and Emmanuel Mudiay (Denver Nuggets). \nEpperson, Froling, and Dalton follow in the footsteps of the likes of Maker, his young brother, Matur, Isaac Humphries, Harry Froling, and Tom Wilson as Australians who have competed at this event. \nNEW PODCAST! Two-time NBA Champion and current Sydney Kings big-man Josh Powell joins the show to talk about his hometown of Atlanta, NBA titles, President Trump, philanthropy, and the NBL. \nSubscribe to the podcast on iTunes by CLICKING HERE . media_camera Callum Dalton. \nThey will be joined by fellow Oceania prospects, Quinn Clinton and Samuel Taane of New Zealand. \nEpperson is currently a senior at La Lumiere School in La Porte, Indiana, and is being recruited by a number of high-major schools.

Samson is the younger brother of Marquette transfer, Harry Froling. \nThe camp also has a women’s portion, which will feature Australians, Cassidy Gould, Chelsea D’Angelo, Britney Epperson, and Claudia Armato. \n“The Basketball without Borders Global Camp is a great opportunity for the top male and female prospects from around the world to compete against one another, learn directly from NBA and FIBA players, legends and coaches, and experience the excitement of NBA All-Star,” NBA Vice President of International Basketball Operations & Head of Elite Basketball, Brooks Meek said. \n“The Basketball without Borders program was founded on the belief that basketball brings young players from different backgrounds together and transcends cultural boundaries.” \nFormer Sydney Kings head coach, Joe Connelly, who’s now an assistant coach for the Denver Nuggets, will be one of the coaches at the camp, as well as Jay Hernandez (Orlando Magic), Fred Vinson (New Orleans Pelicans), Brooklyn Nets scout and NBA D-League Assistant GM, Matt Riccardi. \nAustralia’s Patrick Hunt (President of the World Association of Basketball Coaches) will join Gersson Rosas (Houston Rockets), Marin Sedlacek (Philadelphia 76ers) and Masai Ujiri (Toronto Raptors) as camp directors. \nOlgun Uluc covers basketball for Fox Sports Australia.
