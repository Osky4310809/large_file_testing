They will operate from the West Wing and report directly to Trump. And they’ll have their hands in a bit of everything.\n“All Americans, regardless of their political views, can recognize that government stagnation has hindered our ability to properly function, often creating widespread congestion and leading to cost overruns and delays,” Trump told the Post in a statement. “I promised the American people I would produce results, and apply my ‘ahead of schedule, under budget’ mentality to the government.”\nAdvertisement \n\nThe Office is being touted as both untethered from ideology and the quotidian mêlée of politics. Instead, Kushner promotes it as an ideas hub, “an offensive team” that works with people in and out of government and in tandem with “the business, philanthropic, and academic communities.”\n“We should have excellence in government,” Kushner said from his West Wing office, during a Sunday interview. “The government should run like a great American company. Our hope is that we can achieve successes and efficiencies for our customers, who are the citizens.”\nAlready the Office has met with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Marc Benioff from Salesforce, and Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of Tesla. Silicon Valley, despite being largely opposed to the Trump campaign, has indicated a willingness to cooperate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:52:23.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
