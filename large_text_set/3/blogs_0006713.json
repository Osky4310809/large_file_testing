This extra security option could come in addition to a possible iris scanner and the usual fingerprint sensor, according to a report by Korea Economic Daily . \nFingerprint sensors are starting to feel old school. Aloysius Low/CNET \n\"So what?\" you might say, if you're already happy with your fingerprint sensor. (You've spent years guiding your thumb to the home button at the bottom of your display, after all.) \nBut you may not find a fingerprint sensor there on the Galaxy S8: leaks suggest Samsung may have moved that sensor to the back of the phone. \nRather than building a new habit, it might be faster to let Samsung's face camera do the work -- particularly because it could take less than 0.01 seconds to unlock your phone using facial recognition, according to an unnamed Samsung official quoted in the report. \nIn addition to facial recognition, the Galaxy S8 could also use iris scanning to unlock the device, says the report. Iris scanning was featured in the now recalled Galaxy Note 7 , and Samsung could bring it back to life in the S8. This method of unlocking uses the unique patterns in your eyes as identification, and while it may make you feel like a secret agent , its security merits have been debated . \nIf the S8 does include facial recognition when it is announced on March 29 , it could set the bar for other phones -- especially if Apple does it too. The iPhone 8 is expected to come out later this year, and could include face-scanning tech, too . \nSamsung declined to comment. Samsung Galaxy S8 leaked for the 2,128th time? It seems like every day new images of Samsung's next superphone pop up. by Iyaz Akhtar", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T04:53:28.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
