Yes, that's probably a travel. But since referees don't seem to know, how can I? https://t.co/OTFu1FxXIF \n— CJ Fogler (@cjzero) January 4, 2017 \nJayhawk? More like Jaywalk, know what we’re saying? \nAt the very least that’s three steps, maybe even four. Alas, it went uncalled. \n“I think everybody knows what happened. Want to see my phone? There’s a hundred (messages),” Kansas State coach Bruce Weber told reporters after the game, per The Associated Press . “Everybody knows what happened. I mean, it’s obvious. The TV people came up to me. Everyone.” \nEveryone except the referees, that is.
