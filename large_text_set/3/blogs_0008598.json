There are pitfalls EVERYWHERE. \nBets can go wrong. Twitter posts can come back to haunt you. And, as beautifully demonstrated in the clip above, cameras at football stadiums can catch you doing something VERY silly during a match. \nWatch the video and you will see one unfortunate supporter manage to embarrass himself at Tynecastle, during Hearts' 4-0 Scottish Premiership win against Hamilton. \nThe gentleman in question, sat in the Gorgie Stand behind the goal initially tries to catch a stray ball - and ends up going right over the top of the hoardings: (Photo: Hearts TV) \nOur mystery star eventually ends up flat on his face (no thanks to his cackling pals, who give him a not-so-helping hand on the way). (Photo: Hearts TV) \nWhile video footage of this incident going viral might seem like bad news for this unfortunate Jambos fan, there is an upside. \nHe takes it like a champ. He stands up, bows, laps up the 'adulation' and generally owns the moment. \nWell played, sir. Very, very well played.
