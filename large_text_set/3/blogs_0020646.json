How long I stay doesn't really matter because as long as I'm there I'm completely focused on achieving the best with the club,\" he said. \n\"At the moment we are going through a difficult period on the results, so I think it's much more important to focus on getting it right again.\" \nMattias is ESPN FC's Arsenal correspondent.
