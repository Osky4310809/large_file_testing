Subora fell in love with the beauty of the Philippines the moment he first visited the country in 2007. Permanently residing in the Philippines has also opened a lot of opportunities for Subora. ADVERTISEMENT “The Philippines is my home away from home. It’s a beautiful country. I met my wife here. I also started my MMA career in this country. I am grateful for everything that this country has given me. To me, it’s an honor representing the Philippines in my international fights,” he stated. The 36-year-old Subora is set to return to action on Jan. 14 when he makes his light heavyweight debut against Egyptian Sherif “The Shark” Mohamed in the undercard of ONE: Quest for Power in Jakarta, Indonesia. “I am excited to get back in the cage and showcase my newly-acquired skills. The world will see the new Igor Subora. I don’t know if my opponent is ready for what I am bringing on fight night,” Subora said. A Ukrainian flag might be on his back as he walks to the cage on fight night, but Subora makes sure to have Philippine insignia on his gear. Subora wraps a small Philippine flag around his head as a gesture of appreciation to the nation that gave him a chance to strut his stuff. According to Subora, the Philippine MMA industry played a major role in his professional career and to where he is now. “The Philippine MMA scene had an important role in my career. I am forever thankful for that. Even though I am Ukrainian, I also represent the Philippines every time I step inside the cage,” he stressed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T18:19:00.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
