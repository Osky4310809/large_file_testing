So we were thrilled to see that Jamie Lynn Spears just posted a video of Maddie playing basketball a mere two weeks after the accident.\nWhen Maddie woke up in the hospital , she seemingly had not suffered any neurological damage and was back home a mere few days later . However, there’s always a risk of lasting effects after such a serious incident, so seeing her running around without even skipping a beat is pretty incredible.\nThe Instagram video shows Maddie practicing basketball drills with the caption “#GodIsGood,” and we share Spears’ immense relief that Maddie is recovering so well. 1st Basketball practice today #Godisgood \nA post shared by Jamie Lynn Spears (@jamielynnspears) on Feb 21, 2017 at 6:04pm PST \nAs you can see in the video, Maddie is running all over the court as if nothing scary happened two weeks ago. What a super trooper!\n“When she woke up, they said that it was obvious that she recognized them all. Everybody was crying because it was such a miracle,” a friend of Maddie’s father told People . Another wonderful fair performance Proud of our girl❤️ \nA post shared by Jamie Lynn Spears (@jamielynnspears) on Oct 29, 2016 at 2:27pm PDT \nWe’re sending so much love to Maddie as she continues to get back to normal life and return to school.\nMaddie's doctors cleared her to bring Valentines to her class today. We're so thankful to celebrate Valentine's Day with the ones we love ❤️ pic.twitter.com/LOoIn73N2E \n— Jamie Lynn Spears (@jamielynnspears) February 14, 2017 Now, please be extra cautious on that ATV from this moment on!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:07:26.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
