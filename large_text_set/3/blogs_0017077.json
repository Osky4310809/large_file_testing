Originally, the 60-kWh version was the base car. Then the 60 was replaced with the 70. But last spring, Tesla reintroduced the 60 as a more affordable choice meant to expand the availability of the Model S. Now the company has just announced that it is once again dropping the rear-drive 60 and the all-wheel-drive 60D, making the 75 the new base model. \n-The change raises the price of entry from $71,300 to $77,800 (or $82,800 for the dual-electric-motor AWD version). Tesla says most buyers stepped up to the 75-kWh model anyway, which offers a 249-mile range (259 for the 75D) versus the 60-kWh car’s 210 miles (218 for the 60D). Buyers who do want the 60 have until April 16 to order one. And for those who later change their minds, the company is able to upgrade existing cars from 60 to 75 specification.\n- - 2017 Tesla Model S Updated: A New Face and Improved Range - Secret Pack: Tesla Announces Model S 70-75 Battery Upgrade Pricing - Tesla Model S Research: Full Pricing, Specs, Reviews, and More - -The Model S move follows a similar change for the Model X crossover.
