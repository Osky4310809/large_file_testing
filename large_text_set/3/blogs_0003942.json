I ALREADY FOUND HIM’ \nFormer Leicester scout Steve Walsh believes he’s already brought “the next Kante” to Everton. \nWalsh recruited French midfielder N’Golo Kante for the Foxes from Caen for a reported €8 million fee before last season, and the 25-year-old was instrumental in the club’s surprise Premier League triumph. \nWhile Kante will likely earn a second successive winners’ medal after transferring to Chelsea last summer, Walsh moved to the Toffees and recruited Idrissa Gueye from Aston Villa before Socceroo Mile Jedinak arrived at Villa from Crystal Palace. \nDuring 2016, the 27-year-old midfielder made 176 tackles compared to Kante’s 157, according to Metro. \n“The next Kante? ‘I’ve already found him,’ chortles Walsh, half-serious,” Walsh told The Times in an interview.

Walsh had earmarked Gana to replace Kante at Leicester, having scouted him extensively when he played for Aston Villa, and Gana’s £7m signing typifies Walsh’s knack of seeing value by looking beyond a player’s surrounds.” \nGueye has been displaying Kante-like traits in his defensive midfield role, and recently scored his first Everton goal in a recent man-of-the-match performance against Sunderland. \nLuckily for the Toffees, Walsh’s decision to recruit Gueye wasn’t talked down by Ronald Koeman like Claudio Ranieri tried to with Kante. \nWalsh told The Times that Ranieri was “sceptical” about signing Kante as he didn’t think he was “big enough”. However, Walsh said he was eventually able to wear the Italian down. Chelsea's French midfielder N'Golo Kante.

Source: AFP \nRumours on social media went into overdrive and suggested Messi was appealing for a transfer to another club or a replacement for departing manager Luis Enrique, but Barca officials explained to Spanish media that the superstar was gesturing to his nephew in the crowd. \nMessi’s brother Rodrigo had been trying to call the Argentine in the days leading up to the game, but never got to speak with him. \nMessi sought to make up for the lack of communication by dedicating the imaginary phone call to his family, who were watching the game at the Nou Camp. \nRodrigo’s caption for his Instagram post was, “Simply a great” with two clapping emojis.

You have to inform yourselves, look at the evidence and tell the truth.” \n“We got together at half-time against Las Palmas, what we talked about did not leave there and I am glad of that. \n“The other day I did not say Cristiano does not have to run, we all run here. We are all equals and the key is in our competitiveness.” Ronaldo-less Real cruise 1:30 \nIT’S TRUE: UNITED BARELY EVER CONCEDE PENALTIES AT HOME \nManchester United fans were shocked when referee Kevin Friend gave Bournemouth a penalty after Phil Jones brought down Marc Pugh. \nAccording to this statistic, they had good reason to be. \nIn 476 Premier League games played at Old Trafford, it was just the 24th spot kick awarded to the opposition, and the 17th that was converted. \nThat means United concede a penalty every 19.8 games at home, which is more or less than one every season. Dramatic day at Old Trafford 0:51 \nJoshua King’s strike was the second given at Old Trafford this season after James Milner’s in January. \nUnited lead the top six Premier League teams for the least penalties conceded at home ahead of Chelsea (26), Manchester City (29), Liverpool (37), Arsenal (37) and Tottenham (42). \nMeanwhile, Sir Alex Ferguson’s favourite red wine is now available to Red Devils supporters at home matches, according to The Sun. \nThe 187.5ml Cabernet Sauvignon, made by club sponsors Casillero del Diablo, costs £4.80 and is being served since the Bournemouth clash.
