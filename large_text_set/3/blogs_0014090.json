Afinidad-Bernardo   11:15am #TeamDongYan - Dingdong Dantes and Marian Rivera - celebrating \"National Breakfast Day\". Philstar.com/Deni Rose M. Afinidad-Bernardo \n“Tulog ka pa, gising na sila.” \nSuch was the start of fast food chain’s McDonald’s new video campaign for \"National Breakfast Day\" last March 13, pertaining to early-risers like teachers, security guards and fishermen who wake up early and sometimes, skip breakfast just to have their jobs done. \nTo highlight the value of breakfast, celebrities like Marian Rivera-Dantes, Dingdong Dantes and Enrique Gil took part in \"National Breakfast Day,\" surprising early morning workers with free breakfast. \n“Ako, personally, breakfast is fun. Your mind is fresh, you get to reflect and think and plan kung anong gagawin mo sa araw na ito,” Dingdong explained   Philstar.com on what breakfast means to him. \n“Especially if you have a very hectic day, it’s important to have the proper nutrition and energy to make you last all throughout the day,” espoused the star, who takes a heavy breakfast usually after his morning run at 6 a.m. \n“Sa’kin, madalas, may heavy load the first part of the day before lunch. So eksakto, I get all the nutrients that I need to make work easy.”   \nEggs are his breakfast staple for protein, “At s’yempre, ‘di mawawala ang coffee,” he noted. “’Yung Cheesy Eggdesal ng McDo, paborito naming mag-asawa. Sa ang bago ngayon, ‘yung Burgerdesal, okay ‘yun kasi may protein at carbohydrates.” \nDingdong’s wife, Marian, also stressed the importance of breakfast. \n“Syempre, ano ‘yun eh first meal of the day, s’yempre lalo na kung may gagawin kang trabaho, kailangan talaga busog ka kasi ‘di ka makakapag-isip ng tama ‘pag ‘di ka kumain,” she told Philstar.com . \n“When you skip meals, you irritate your stomach,” Dr. Ma. Cecilia Catapang said in a talk in Makati City recently. She warned that when the stomach is irritated, it can lead to inflammation and in the long run, diseases like ulcer and stomach cancer. \nStudies show that those who eat breakfast have improved concentration, better performance and lower cholesterol levels than those who skip it. \nWhat is Dingdong and Marian’s daughter, Zia’s, favorite breakfast? \nMarian declared: “Me! My breast!” \nAs the actress and TV host explained: “Ako talaga, isa talaga ‘yun (breastfeeding) sa mga tinataguyod ko na gawin talaga ng mga nanay na i-breastfeed nila mga anak nila kasi mas maraming benepisyo ang makukuha nila, para din sa mga anak nila na maging healthy at ‘di sakitin!”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T06:18:27.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
