(But who’s counting, right?) As you might have guessed, we’re quite excited about our latest event, in large part because we have some new tricks up our sleeves. (More on that at a later date. We promise.) \nAside from a few tweaks here and there, though, the next MozCon won’t be much different from those in years past. \nThat is, it'll be unique and awesome in equal amounts. \nMozCon 2017: July 17–19 in Seattle You can still expect world-class speakers sharing original information in a one-of-a-kind, charged atmosphere.
