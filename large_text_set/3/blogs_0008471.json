Trends Viral \nThe Air India jet, with 231 passengers and 18 crew members on board, was traveling from Ahmedabad to London when it went missing from air traffic control radio frequencies for 22 minutes from 10:27am GMT Friday morning. \nThe communications blackout resulted in two German Luftwaffe fighter jets being scrambled to escort the plane, Spiegel reported. \nAs part of “pre-alarm” measures in Germany, fighter jets are on standby to assess any wayward aircraft traveling in the nation’s airspace that could pose a threat.
