King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 3 hours ago 2 \nAnthrax drummer Charlie Benante said he's not thrilled about the quality of albums coming out these days, branding them mostly \"kind of half good, half bad.\" \nHe said on the Mike James Rock Show : \"I find the lack of really good records nowadays disturbing, because... \n\"If I come out and say that I think a lot of the records that came out were kind of half good, half bad, people will look at me, like, 'Who the fuck is he to say?' You can't even say anything about music anymore. \n\"I take music really music seriously. I studied this shit since I was young. So when I say it lacks something, it's not coming from just a personal view; it just lacks something from something that I've learned throughout the years of how a good record is a good record, a shitty record is a shitty record.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:21:01.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
