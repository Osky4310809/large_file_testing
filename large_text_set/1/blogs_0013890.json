Open beg. 2017 in Paris Initiative by @Xavier75 - Director: @RoxanneVarza 13 mins ago Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg announces first worldwide Startup Garage at Station F Even though we’re still under construction, we love to have people pay us a visit at STATION F. Hundreds of startups, VCs from around the world, journalists from Kenya, Iran, China or the U.S, the mayors of Paris and London, and even the French President put on hard hats and boots to get a preview of the world’s biggest startup campus. Today, we had the chance to welcome someone incredibly special, Facebook COO and Leanin Founder Sheryl Sandberg, for an equally incredible announcement . photo: TechCrunch Facebook’s first *ever* full startup program will be at Station F Some of you already knew Facebook would be involved at Station F. We announced it at the last TechCrunch Disrupt : they are one of our founding partners. Despite Techcrunch journalist Mike Butcher’s best efforts to have Roxanne Varza reveal the content of Facebook’s activity at Station F, the news remained under the radar until now! Watch the video for good ol’ memories of on-stage battle between Roxanne and Mike :) Welcome, Startup Garage :-) Now it’s official: Facebook will be launching their first startup program known as “Startup Garage from Facebook.” This 6-months program is designed for 10–15 startups dedicated to data, which will take up an 80-desks zone on campus. Sheryl Sandberg and the first entrepreneurs of Startup Garage Wait — it gets even better. These startups and the rest of the entire Station F campus will be able to benefit from Facebook’s experts and experience in a variety of fields, including marketing, technical development, UX/UI, and more. While Facebook already is a huge supporter of entrepreneurship around the world (with initiatives like F8 of FBStart), this is the *first time* Facebook is investing into a physical space. And we couldn’t be more thrilled that they picked Station F to partner with. Data-driven startups: apply now to join the Startup Garage Some of the first startups Facebook has announced for their program include Mapstr , a great tool to bookmark your favorite places, or Chekk , a tool that helps you manage your digital identity and already has offices in France, Hong Kong and Australia. For anyone interested in learning more about Facebook’s Startup Garage at Station F and apply, you can find more information on our “Campus” page (where you can also find information about our other programs on campus).
