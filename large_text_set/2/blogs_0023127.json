Alfred Lord Tennyson once said, \"It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\", but he's pretty much a liar. Here's what it really feels like when you're nursing a broken heart: You Know You'll Never Love Again \n(source) \nNever ever. There's literally no one else on the planet who could love you the same â€” or at all, for that matter. There are 7.125 billion people on this green Earth, and each and every one of those people has a soulmate. Except you. That is a statistical fact. It Actually Physically Hurts \n(source) \nWhether your heart is just fractured or full-on broken, it comes with an actual physical pain. It feels like the other person punched through your chest with their bare hands, ripped out your heart, and then devoured it in front of you. You're asking for an ice pack for your heart so you can pack your heart in ice and never feel another thing ever again. You Journal the F*ck Out of Your Feelings \n(source) \nYou feel lame for feeling these feelings, but that doesn't stop you from recording them. You write down your feelings until your fingers are worn down to stumps. You're single-handedly keeping 3M in business because of all the paper you're using. You Just Cry. A Lot \n(source) \nAnd then when you're done crying, you cry some more. There's no point in wearing make up, because at any moment you could spontaneously erupt in tears and end up looking like a weird mythical swamp monster. There's no way that one human body can produce that many tears, right? Eventually you have to run out of tears, right? Everything Reminds You of That Person \n(source) \nOn any other day, the world is just the world. But when your heart is broken, everything you see is filtered through the lens of that person. Forget looking at the sky, because you'll just be reminded of their blue eyes. And if you gaze upon a happy couple in love, you're done. You Feel So Rejected \nYou feel exactly like chopped liver. Except that chopped liver is pate, and pate is a delicacy in France. So in some regions, even chopped liver is more desirable than you. \nHow do you get over a broken heart?
