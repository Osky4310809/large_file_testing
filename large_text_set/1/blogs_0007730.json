Matt Ludtke/AP \nThe New York Giants lost to the Green Bay Packers 38-13 in the NFL Playoffs on Sunday and Odell Beckham Jr. has apparently taken the loss hard. \nDuring the game, Beckham finished with just 28 yards receiving on four catches. He was targeted 11 times and had at least three drops in the game. \nAfter the game, several outlets reported that a hole in the wall outside the Giants locker room was caused by Beckham punching the wall. \nWitnesses on Lambeau grounds crew said @OBJ_3 punched this hole in wall outside locker room pic.twitter.com/GVuP0m7a34 — Neil Best (@sportswatch) January 9, 2017 \nAccording to Sal Paolantonio of ESPN ( via Jordan Raanan of ESPN ), Beckham was also banging his head against the locker room door. Raanan also reported on the hole on the wall. \nBeckham's performance came just days after Beckham and several teammates flew to Miami during the Giants' off day leading up to the playoffs. While most dismissed the trip as a non-issue — including Eli Manning who dropped a great dad joke about the situation — it did open the group up to potential criticism if the team performed poorly in the game. \nNeedless to say, social media had a field day with the alleged wall punching. \nCould be disastrous if he did that aboard ... eh, too easy. https://t.co/fATOQZWTgJ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T10:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:28:30.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
