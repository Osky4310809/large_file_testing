Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIt has been illegal to use a hand held mobile phone while driving, or while stopped with the engine on, since December 2003. \nBut with tougher penalties being enforced from this month, more drivers will undoubtedly be caught out breaking the law when they don't even realise they're doing it. \nUnder the new laws, people seen holding their mobile phone while driving will be handed six penalty points and a £200 fine - rather than the former three points and a £100 fine. \nDrivers who have passed their test in the last two years will automatically lose their licence, having received six points. \nWith apps like CityMapper and Google Maps, it's often easier for drivers to use a mobile handset instead of a traditional sat nav - but unless you can guarantee you won't need to touch it for the duration of your trip, it would be wise not to use your phone. \nThe law also applies when drivers are sitting in stationary traffic, so they technically can't even adjust the route at lights or in a traffic jam. Use hands-free \nAccording to the AA, while it's an offence to be seen using a hand held phone, regardless of whether driving has been affected, this is not the case for hands-free phones. \nHowever , if you’re seen not to be in control of a vehicle while using a hands-free phone you can be prosecuted for that offence. \nThe penalties for 'not in proper control' are a £100 fine and 3 points and up to £1,000 fine if it goes to court. \nMake sure you set up your phone properly to use as hands-free before you set off and, if you need to touch your phone at any point during your journey, pull over to do so. It's best not to touch the phone again if you can help it (Photo: Westend61) \nA spokesman for the AA said: “”It should be programmed with the route before you set off. \n“If it pops up with a message which requires just one press of a button, such as ‘A faster route has been found. Accept/ Decline’ you should be OK to do this, as you would with an in-built sat-nav. \n“But if you need to re-programme the route then pull over and stop somewhere safe to do it.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T17:00:42.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
