How you ask? Although the title has already given it away, but … Summer jackets. If you’re a typical layer-it-all girl, you will love these! Now that spring is upon us, it's time to trade in your huge coats for something much lighter. Of course, we know that summer in a tropical country like ours is too much to even think of jackets. But, believe us, if you make the right choice, you CAN pull of the trend quite smoothly. The trick is to keep it easy, breezy and light with what you wear on the inside and choosing a jacket made from a summer-appropriate, breathable fabric. To help you out, we made a list of seven summer jackets that we saw our fashion-forward celebs wearing recently: 1. This military coloured, belted number. We absolutely love the cut and design here. 2. Tapsee Pannu’s linen jacket with floral detailing is a concrete must-have. 3. We are going bonkers over this scalloped, embroidered-in-a-hundred-colours cape by Hemant Nandita! 4. Anushka’s black sleeveless cape has to be your go-to pick this summer! 5. Drooling over Kiran Rao’s gorgeous white linen jacket from Eka? You simply can’t ask for a better one! \n6.Sonakshi’s sheer jacket with detailed embroidery is the only statement piece you will need this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:08:49.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
