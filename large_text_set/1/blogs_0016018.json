So thank you very much for your support and assistance to the DOH,” Ubial noted. \nUnder the program, each of the beneficiaries will be provided with a pack of fortified rice for one meal a day starting in February. The food packs are available in champorado, chicken arroz caldo, beef stew and ginataan, among others.   \nThe food packs were donated by Rise Against Hunger and fortified with 23 essential vitamins and minerals and meet one-third of the nutrition requirement of pregnant and lactating women. \nReigning Miss Universe Pia Wurtzbach and 29 candidates visited Baguio City yesterday. \nThey picked strawberries and witnessed a Panagbenga-like street dancing and flower float parade from Upper Session Road to the Baguio Country Club. \nPanagbenga is the Baguio Flower Festival, the Philippine version of the Rose Float Festival in Pasadena, California. Panagbenga lures hundreds of thousands to the city every February. \n“It is an honor that international beauties come to the city,” said Baguio City Mayor Mauricio Domogan. “It was just unfortunate that the usual Panagbenga parade route was shortened because of time limitations.” \nAs early as 6 a.m., residents lined the streets to see the beauty contestants. – With Artemio Dumlao", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T03:19:12.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
