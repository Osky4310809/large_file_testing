Warning: Language may be offensive to some: A post shared by chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) on Feb 12, 2017 at 7:47pm PST \n“Well (my brother) wanted to make me one and asked me what I wanted on it,” Pratt wrote, going on to exhibit his all-around American patriotism. “I went for the usual chris answer, American bald eagle smoking a cigar, holding a machine gun and an American flag whirling all bad a** in the wind maybe with some nunchucks or something.” \nBut after giving it more thought, Pratt decided upon something less “bad-a** hero” (and less profane) and more along the lines of “comfort” for when he felt homesick.   \n“So I though about this great bible (sic) verse Philippians 4:13 which I’ve relied on for strength from time to time. And he knocks this thing out in like a day!! Reclaimed wood and a wood burner. All by hand,” he wrote. \nPratt proceeded to describe his brother as his best friend and a real hero in his own right, as he is an Army veteran and sheriff’s deputy, and ended by declaring the new wooden pocket dump tray to be his favorite possession. \nThis is great, and a welcome relief for those who fear that all of Hollywood has become lost and out-of-touch with the real world and real people surrounding them. \nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter so everyone can see Chris Pratt’s social media display of his favorite Bible verse.
