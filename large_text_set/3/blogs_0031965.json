WHAT DID MESSI SAY? \nMessi scored the only goal of Thursday's 1-0 win over Chile, hitting from the spot after referee Sandro Ricci gave a dubious penalty for a push on Angel Di Maria. \nBut the Barcelona star was enraged by linesman Marcelo Van Gasse in the second half and is alleged to have verbally abused the official. \n\"F**k off, your mother's c***,\" he is reported to have screamed at Van Gasse, before refusing to shake his hand at the final whistle. \nAnd while the incident was not included in the officials' original report, it was added on Monday and sent to Conmebol. WHY HAS MESSI BEEN BANNED? \nFIFA intervened as incontrovertible video emerged of Messi swearing in the direction of the linesman. It's fined him Â£8,000 in addition to a four-game ban. WHAT GAMES WILL MESSI MISS? \nIf upheld, FIFA's four-game ban would see Messi sit out World Cup qualifiers against Bolivia, Uruguay, Venezuela and Peru. \nArgentina currently lie third in the South American branch of World Cup qualification, behind Brazil and Uruguay.
