Crew chief Paul Wolfe was fined $65,000 and suspended for the next three races, while Keselowski lost 35 driver points in the championship standings and the team lost 35 owner points. \nKeselowski, who dropped from second in the driver points standings as a result, reacted to the news on “NASCAR Race Hub” Wednesday as it came down. He also confirmed a statement by Team Penske that Brian Wilson would serve as his crew chief this weekend at Auto Club Speedway, adding that Wolfe would be missed. \n“First off, my crew chief Paul Wolfe is an elite crew chief, and I feel really lucky to have him,” Keselowski said. “He’s one of those guys who wins races every year, and he’s got great cars, great speed. If you look through NASCAR’s loop data, which is real fancy term for a bunch of numbers, we’re leading in a lot of categories — and one of those is speed, speed in the car. A large part of the credit for that goes to Paul Wolfe and his leadership of our team. \n“So to lose a guy like that definitely hurts. He’s a great asset to our team. But this is one of those setbacks that every team faces, and we’re just going to have to get through it. It’s going to be a handful of races, and we’re going to have to do the best that we can during that time. The good thing about Brian Wilson is that he comes from the XFINITY side as a crew chief who just won with Joey Logano at Las Vegas. And even before that, he was the lead engineer on the No. 2 team — so he brings a lot of knowledge and experience.” \nCheck out what else Keselowski had to say about the latest news in the video above. \nIn addition, Keselowski’s fifth-place finish at Phoenix is encumbered after his car failed the post-race rear wheel steer on the Laser Inspection Station, or LIS. \nHarvick and his team were penalized for a “track bar slider assembly” that was unapproved by NASCAR. For this infraction, crew chief Rodney Childers has been fined $25,000 and suspended for this Sunday’s race weekend at Auto Club Speeday. The team also lost 10 driver and 10 team owner points. \nHarvick’s Phoenix sixth-place finish in his No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford also is encumbered. \nHere is a look at NASCAR’s official penalty report for the week:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:06:27.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
