Instead, the indefatigable director-writer-cinematographer managed to perform all three roles on two new films ( Mosaic and Logan Lucky ), begin producing Ocean's Eight , and, apparently, watch hundreds of movies and television shows—when he wasn't reading a book or a play. \nThat's right—the annual list of Soderbergh entertainment consumption is out. This year's edition was quite revealing; he quit Westworld and Stranger Things after the first episodes, opting instead for Black Mirror and Mr. Robot binges. (With Panic Room, Children of Men , Seven , and Apocalypse Now also on the list, we noticed a bit of an apocalyptic/dystopian throughline.) \nSoderbergh gets an \"A\" for approachability for his populist choices, with a mix of highfalutin titles thrown in. They range from Karl Ove Knausgaard's My Struggle: Book Five to the director's unabashed obsession with the Olympics. Even better, he went out with a bang: on Christmas Day, Soderbergh enjoyed a double feature of Rogue One and The Godfather, Part II .
