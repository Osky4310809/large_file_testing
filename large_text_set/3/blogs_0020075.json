Today, the streaming service released the first look at the revival, including Jonah Ray as the new Joel/Mike, depending on who you prefer, as well as Patton Oswalt as TV’s Son of TV’s Frank and Felicia Day as Pearl Forrester’s daughter, Kinga. We also hear Crow T. Robot speak with his third different voice: First, it was Trace Beaulieu, then Bill Corbett, and now, Hampton Yount (Baron Vaughn’s Tom Servo remains quiet).\nOne of the biggest mysteries about the new MST3K is what movies the Satellite of Love crew will be forced to watch. The trailer gives away at least two of them: Reptilicus , the 1961 Danish-American, um, “classic” about a giant reptile, and another film involving naked women wearing sunglasses. Mitchell (Mitchell!) star Joe Don Baker likes the sound of that last one.\nMystery Science Theater 3000 returns on April 14.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:26:29.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
