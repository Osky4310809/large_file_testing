I mean, you guys are rock solid... right? Everything is sunshine and rainbows and there's no way that the two of you are breaking up before you make it to your reservation at that fancy restaurant that charges a cancellation fee and has your credit card on file. \nHaving second thoughts? Ready to take a cold hard look at the chances your relationship is about to crash and burn right around the most romantic day of the year? Here's what the experts say are the tell-tale signs you're about to get dumped. 1. She Won't Commit To V-Day Plans \nIf your girlfriend is being wishy washy about nailing down concrete Valentine's Day plans, relationship expert April Masini says the likelihood of you two lasting much longer is pretty slim. \"If she’s busy on Valentine’s Day and doesn’t want to commit to a date, it’s because she doesn’t want to commit to you any more,\" Masini says. \"Valentine’s Day is the biggest love holiday on the calendar, and if you’re getting a lukewarm to cold response for a date, it’s because a breakup is coming.\" 2. You've Been Seeing Each Other Less \nListen, life happens and schedules get crazy – but according to relationship expert Deborah Graham , when you really want to see someone, you find a way to make it happen. \n\"If your partner is suddenly too busy and not working as hard to make plans with you, you are no longer a priority to her,\" she says. Take note of how frequently you two have been seeing each other lately, and which one of you tends to initiate plans. 3. She's Not Texting You As Much \nNotice a sudden decrease in the amount of text messages you're exchanging with your lady? Julie Spira, CEO of Cyber-Dating Expert says that it's not looking good. \"When your relationship is on its way out, you'll stop sending those 'good morning' and 'sweet dreams' text messages to your significant other,\" she says. \"If she’s not feeling it anymore, you won’t be hearing much from her.\" 4. She Doesn't Want Any V-Day Gifts \nIf you had a sneaking suspicion that this might be a trap, you weren't wrong. \"The only women who say 'no gifts' are the ones who don't want gifts from you,\" says radio personality and resident love guru Kevin Klein . \"In general, women love everything about gifts ; even the annoying things like bows and putting 'thought into it.' If she says 'no gifts,'she means, 'no you.'\" 5. She Brings In A Third Wheel \nNo, your girlfriend's BFF didn't actually want to third wheel on your date. According to Graham, that friend is there on official relationship-ending business. \"She's getting a second opinion on the relationship to see if she's crazy for wanting to break up,” Graham explains, “or justified in her belief that things are coming to an end. It's like a seal of approval and a support system on standby, all in one.\" You might want to buy that third wheel a drink. 6. You're Not Having Sex \nShe's not really tired. She doesn't have a migraine. And even if that is all true, tired people with migraines still bone when they're into each other. \"If you have been hearing the words 'I'm too tired' or 'I don’t feel good,' it's one of the biggest red flags that the relationship is coming to an end,\" Graham says. \"It means that she's lost connection with you, and the excitement, lust and desire is no longer there.\" Harsh. \nRELATED: How To Keep Your Sex Life Going Strong In A Long-Term Relationship 7. She Picks Fights For No Reason \nIf you can't tell your woman that she looks hot without her bringing up the time that you told her sister that she looked hot two New Year's Eves ago, you're in trouble. \"When people pick fights, it's typically tied to something bigger,\" Graham explains. \"If it's coming out like rapid fire, the intention may be to get a heated response out of you in hopes that it will either get you so mad that you decide you've had enough and break up with her, or respond in a way that it gives her a reason to break up with you.\" Show comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:44:17.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
