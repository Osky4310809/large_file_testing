But don't worry, because it can always get worse. \nThe Kett Archon looks like the sort of fellow who doesn't make friends easily, but there are others in the new galaxy who seem willing to take a more welcoming approach. And even though the Pathfinders are few in numbers, it's like the man says: \"I don't need an army. I've got a Krogan.\" \nMass Effect: Andromeda comes out on March 21 in North America and March 23 in Europe, with a \" Play First \" trial for Origin Access subscribers beginning on March 16. Catch up with the latest Andromeda Initiative training update, a tour of the sleek ship Tempest and the Nomad off-roader, right here . ABOUT THE AUTHOR Andy Chalk As lead news writer during ‘merican hours, Andy covers the day-to-day events that keep PC gaming so interesting, exciting, and occasionally maddening. He’s fond of RPGs, FPSs, dungeons, Myst, and the glorious irony of his parents buying him a TRS-80 instead of an Atari so he wouldn't end up wasting his life on videogames.
