On Christmas Eve they lost 2-1, at home, to Queen’s Park and on New Year’s Eve they lost 2-1, away, at East Fife. Before those losses Livi had won five on the trot. In England, Slavisa Jokanovic and Fulham had a mixed holiday period. They beat Ipswich 2-0 on Boxing Day, but lost 2-1 to Brighton on January 2nd. On December 30th Fulham’s game against Reading at the Madejski Stadium was called off at half time due to fog. That game will be replayed at some point in the season. Currently Fulham sit 6th in the Championship, six points off the play-offs. Fulham vs Reading - Called offYeovil vs Portsmouth - Still playing — BigSport (@BigSportGB) December 30, 2016 Ritchie Hanlon and Paul Hughes are in the thick of a relegation fight with Hayes & Yeading in the Southern Premier League. On the December 27th they were up two goals versus Slough, at home, only to lose the game 3-2. On January 2nd the co-mangers faced their old club Kings Langley, and lost 1-0. Right now Hayes & Yeading are 22nd in the league, having lost 9 of their last 13 games. A league below them, Micky Hazard and Hadley FC are also struggling. They find themselves 19th in the Spartan South Midlands Football League’s Premier Division. They lost 2-0 away to Cockfosters on December 27th. RUMOUR MILL On December 8th the Evening Standard revealed that a trio of Chelsea greats were on the brink of beginning their own odysseys into the ups and downs of football management. According to that report Frank Lampard , Ashley Cole , and John Terry are set to be offered assistance from the English Football Association to gain coaching badges and experience within the national set-up. Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes were also mentioned as being offered the same opportunity. The report states that these players may be asked to participate with coaching England development teams en route to gaining UEFA A and Pro Licenses. TOP VID With Zola now plying his trade at Birmingham City, this month’s Top Vid celebrates one of the best games Chelsea and Birmingham ever played. It was the opening day of the 2007/08 season. The scene: Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea entered the game undefeated in 63 previous games at the Bridge, which equaled a record held by Liverpool at Anfield between 1978 and 1980. A win would make Chelsea sole possessors of the record, but it wouldn’t come easy. Birmingham struck first, against the run of play, through a Mikael Forssell goal (how could you Mikael?!) on the 15 minute mark. However, Chelsea would answer just two minutes later, drawing level with a rare Claudio Pizarro goal. Florent Malouda gave Chelsea the lead on the half hour mark, but Birmingham made it 2-2 just five minutes later, through Olivier Kapo. Chelsea would get the last laugh through a trademark Michael Essien thunderbolt (aided by dodgy goalkeeping) though. Here is that Moment of Essi-zen, courtesy of YouTuber chelseafc316613. Chelsea would extend the record to 86 games, before losing to Liverpool 1-0 on October 26th, 2008.
