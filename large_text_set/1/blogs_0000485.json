Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSouthampton boss Claude Puel admitted Saints' New Year's day collapse was simply one game too far for his exhausted players. \nSaints had looked on course for a gritty point at Everton in a tense game with few chances for both sides, but then fell apart when they conceded three goals in the last 17 minutes. \nAnd the French coach insisted a Christmas programme that has seen them play three games in six days was simply too punishing for a side that has endured a heavy cup programme this season. \n“We start the season with many games – European games – we’ve played every three days and sometimes every two days and always without recovery for my players,” he said. \n“We had a list like Real Madrid and Barcelona, but not their squad. Just since Boxing Day we have played three games in five days and we tried to give a good answer, but it impossible. We did for 70 minutes, but we couldn't give a good answer in the end.” Enner Valencia scored the first of Everton's three goals against Southampton (Photo: PA Wire) Leighton Baines made it 2-0 to Everton...

But they were courageous, and they will improve from this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:02:27.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
