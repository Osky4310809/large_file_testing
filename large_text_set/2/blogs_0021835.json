The campaign was a huge success, and Hodgson secured the funds to produce 14 new episodes of the show. On Tuesday, following a screening of the first episode of the new season for Kickstarter backers, Hodgson revealed that season 11 would be available on Netflix on April 14th . Don't Miss : Watch the first official unboxing video for the Nintendo Switch \nWhen the Kickstarter campaign launched back in 2015, Hodgson asked for a minimum of $2 million to produce three new, full-length episodes of MST3K . If he could raise $3.3 million, he’d be able to double it to six episodes, and $5.5 million would allow him to double it yet again to 12. The campaign eventually eclipsed $5.7 million, and with an additional $600,000 of funding, the team committed to 14 episodes. \nOver the course of the next year, Hodgson introduced the cast and the writers that would bring the MST3K universe back to life, with Jonah Ray serving as the host, Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt replacing the original mad scientists. Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo will also return (albeit with new voices) and Hodgson himself will be featured in the new season as well. \nAs a fan of the original show, I personally couldn’t be more excited to have 14 new movies to watch a guy and his robot pals make fun of in a fake movie theater. Here’s hoping this isn’t the end of MST3K .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:07:27.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
