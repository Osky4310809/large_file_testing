The subject, of course, is the Trump immigration ban that has dominated the past seven days. Conway already justified the blocking of refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries by brushing off detainments as inconveniences . On Thursday night, she went further and completely made up a fake terror attack called the “Bowling Green Massacre.” She really said this :\n“I bet it’s brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green Massacre. Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered.”\nWell yes, this actually is a revelation to people because the massacre that Conway cites never happened. There is an actual thing called the Massacre Haunted House in Bowling Green, Kentucky, but that’s probably not what Conway’s talking about, right? \nConway may actually be referring to the arrest of two Iraqi nationals in Bowling Green, Kentucky in 2011 after carrying out improvised explosive device (IED) attacks on U.S. soldiers — not in Kentucky but in Iraq . The two men were indicted on terrorism charges and lived in Kentucky for a few years, but they never carried out a massacre in the United States. Anyway, it looks like alternative facts are alive and well.\n(Via MSNBC & FBI.gov )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:50:26.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
