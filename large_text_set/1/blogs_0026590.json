I know, you just got Android 7.1.1 , officially, but we are now ready to start preparing for Android 7.1.2 ! Google just announced that the first public beta is rolling out as early as today to supported devices. \nAt this time, we don’t know much about Android 7.1.2, only that it’s an “incremental maintenance release focused on refinements, so it includes a number of bugfixes and optimizations, along with a small number of enhancements for carriers and users.” Yep, that’s all we know until that beta shows up. \nDevices supported out of the gate for the Beta include the Pixel and Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, Nexus Player, and Pixel C. The Nexus 6P will join the party “soon.” The final release won’t be here for a “couple of months.” \nNOTE : Google confirmed to us today that the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will not see the 7.1.2 update. \nIf you want to be a part of the Android Beta program, sign-up here . Next Story Nextbit Joins Razer, Will Act as Independent Mobile Division CabbageHeadCat. \nI decided to keep my Pixel out of the beta program. I am trying to not be so bleeding edge this once and just let the phone be the phone. So far so good. Chris_K \nI switch constantly between iphone 7 Plus and Nexus 6p.. right now, iphone 7 plus on 10.3.1 beta is simply too good to put down. zach471 \nPlease google, fix my Pixel’s bluetooth issues. CabbageHeadCat. \nAs in the intermittent audio drops? rebretz000 \nWill Verizon Pixels be able to participate? Suicide_Note \nYes. Defenestratus \nYesterday after hockey practice I went to pickup my 6P that was almost nearly at full charge when I put it in my bag. It was dead. C’est mort. \nHope they fix the “ZOMG ITS COLD” battery bug. enigmaco \nAlmost afraid to update my phone has been jacked up since the last update. MicroNix \nFast updates. Phone jacked. I guess that’s a Fast Jack. JSo \nIf there’s nothing all that different then meh. I’m pretty happy on my Pixel ROM for my Nexus 5X. \nAlso, I don’t think my Nexus player has even gotten the 7.1 update. I think it’s still on 7.0 Joshua Smith \nMine is still on 7.0 as well. JSo \nOdd. It’s in the Beta program. I wonder if that has anything to do with it Nayners \nMy wife’s 5X would not update to 7.1 or receive the monthly updates until I flashed the factory image for her. Now, she recieves all updates like clockwork. For whatever reason it seems that the beta program got the some of the 5X (6P, too?) off the proper update track for 7.1.1. BobButtons \nMy 5X is the first phone I’ve kept longer than a year and it still does everything I want. Would I like more RAM? Sure. But it definitely holds up for what I need it, especially running PureNexus. \nNo thanks, after the horrible experience getting full 6.0 I think I will skip beta programs this time. jose \nwhen am i gonna be able to buy a pixel xl from google? I didnt wanna buy it as soon as it came out as i was still making payment on my current phone(nexus). Now that im ready its never in stock Suicide_Note", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:21:31.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
