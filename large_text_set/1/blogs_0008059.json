I added this one called “Velvet Violet” in my collection a few months back.\n\nPrice: \nUSD 53/INR 3600 approximately.\nProduct Description: \nTom ford lip color matte creates a powerfully sophisticated look of unadulterated color. Formulated with a luxurious, velvet matte finish, the lip color matte smoothes comfortably onto the lips in a spectrum of richly pigmented hues from sensuous pink neutrals to alluring bolds.\nMy Experience with Tom Ford Velvet Violet Matte Lip Color: It is a gorgoeus berry shade with fuchsia undertone. In my opinion, it is quite a unique shade and not the kind that you find easily. The berry tones makes it such a gorgeous color, especially winter wine and the fuchsia undertones keep it looking fresh and vibrant. I’d call it a semi-matte lipstick. It still has that little satiny finish to it.\n\nThe lipstick comes packed in this beautiful metallic copper and gold packaging. There is the Tom Ford’s “TF” embossed on the bullet.\n\nThe texture is very smooth and goes on smoothly on the lips. It is very comfortable and never feels drying on lips. And now that I am wearing it in extreme cold weather too, I am absolutely enjoying wearing it. It is super pigmented. One swipe gives you almost 95% pigment and you get a full on bold bright color with another swipe.\n\nThe staying power is good 7-8 hours on me. It looks more fuchsia after a few hours as it starts to settle a bit. It pretty much survives a full meal and my endless cups of coffee. The only problem I find with this is that it does smudge a bit, especially under my lower lip, but then, with a lip color as bright as this, you do need a lip pencil to keep it in place, so that is something to keep in mind.\n\nThis lipstick transfers quite less, fades evenly and looks absolutely beautiful. This is definitely my favorite winter lipstick at the moment and would totally be abused by me. Highly recommend it. It is not available in India at the moment, but if you can get hold of it while travelling, definitely give it a go! \n\nIMBB Rating: \n4.5/5\nTom Ford Sable Smoke Lip Color \nTom Ford Erotic 07 Patent Finish Lip Color \nTom Ford Lip Color – Cherry Lush \nTom Ford Richard Lips and Boys Lip Colour \nTom Ford Giacomo Lip Color \nTom Ford Lip Colour – Violet Fatale \nMaybelline Colorsensational Velvet Matte Mat 11 \nMaybelline Colorsensational Velvet Matte Mat 5 \nMaybelline Colorshow Lively Violet Creamy Matte Lipcolor \nStreet Wear Color Rich Lipstick Violet Cream \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T06:23:27.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
