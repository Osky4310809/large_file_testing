These include hypertension , high cholesterol, and diabetes . The inflammation might be a driving force behind both the joint issues and the heart disease factors, the experts believe. \nSearch Out Peace and Quiet Living next to a lots of traffic could hurt your brain: People who live within 50 meters (about 55 yards) of a major traffic road were 7 percent more likely to develop dementia than those who lived 300 meters away or further, a new study in The Lancet found. The researchers weren’t able to prove that proximity to traffic causes dementia, but they believe both noise and air pollution can harm your brain. \nRe-Think Those E-Cigs We’ve previously reported on the hidden dangers of e-cigarettes , but now the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is exploring another issue with them: the possibility of them exploding. In fact, research from the FDA calculated 92 cases of e-cigs overheating, catching fire, or exploding—half of which caused injury—from 2009 to 2015. So in April, the FDA is hosting a public workshop on the issue to help clarify safety concerns associated with them. \nGet Enough D Skimping on vitamin D can be a real pain: Men with the lowest blood levels of vitamin D were 113 percent more likely to experience frequent headaches than those with the highest levels, a study in Scientific Reports found. It’s possible that sufficient vitamin D can suppress inflammatory compounds in your body, or trigger the production of anti-inflammatory compounds, both which can help headaches, the researchers write.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T20:36:44.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
