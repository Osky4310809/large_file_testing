Go sit in the corner, listen to the '96 count, and think about what you've done! January 26, 2017 \nBut has Triple J really gone mainstream or sold out? \nThe short answer is probably not, but there have been some interesting shifts in the history of the music poll in terms of both genre and, in a welcome change, gender. \nTwo years ago I analysed the crossover between the Hottest 100 with the pop charts (in this case the Aria end-of-year top 100 singles) to get a feel for whether Triple J is becoming more mainstream. At that point, I didn‚Äôt think there had been any major trend towards more popular music. \nI‚Äôve run the same analysis again, with similar results (more details on the methods below): Overlap between the hottest 100 and the aria charts \nThe result in 2016 is the same as it was in 2015. While it‚Äôs slightly higher than it has been in the 2000s, the crossover is still lower than the high point in the late 90s, when the likes of Silverchair, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More hit both the singles charts and the Hottest 100. \nIt‚Äôs also worth noting that some of the artists mentioned as examples of mainstream or pop music, such as Beyonc√© , haven‚Äôt appeared in the Aria end-of-year list for a while. Beyonc√©‚Äôs last appearance was 2011‚Äôs Best Thing I Never Had (whether this is due to the thematic shift in her work, or her use of different platforms and marketing, I‚Äôve no idea). \nSo, I also looked at the appearance of artists in the Hottest 100 andchecked ifthey‚Äôd ever appeared in an Aria end-of-year chart: chart \nAgain, there‚Äôs no trend towards the Hottest 100 becoming more mainstream, even taking into account artists who make guest appearances in songs. \nBut one thing that definitely has changed is the mix of genres. I used Spotify‚Äôs API to obtain what it considers to be the top two genres that describe each artist, and then grouped these genres into five broad categories. \nThere have been two large shifts in genre. The first is the rise of electronic music, and the second is the increasing popularity of hip-hop (grouped here under ‚Äúurban‚Äù): genres \nMusic loosely grouped under ‚Äúrock‚Äù (stuff with guitars, bass, drums ‚Äì this includes everything from metal to indie rock) has ceased to dominate the poll as it did in the early years, but it‚Äôs still by far the largest category. I‚Äôve previously done a more detailed breakdown on genres , if you‚Äôre interested in specific categories. \nFemale representation in the Hottest 100 is also improving, with the 2016 result the equal second-highest since 1993 based on figures compiled by BuzzFeed , which I‚Äôve updated here: female representation \nThis counts any act that has a female artist involved, including as a guest vocalist, and sits at 34% in 2016. Significantly, in this year‚Äôs poll seven of the top 10 tracks, and all of the top three,had a female artist involved ‚Äìwhich sets a new record for the poll. \nAlongside these shifts there has been a big increase in the phenomenon of the guest artist, which is characteristic of both electronic music and hip-hop: \nFinally, anyone looking to criticise the inclusion of pop artists in the Hottest 100 should keep the 1994 result in mind, when Kylie‚Äôs Confide in Me made it to No 30. Triple J Hottest 100: does Australia's youth broadcaster have an identity crisis? | Shaun Prescott Read more Methods \nI scraped the Aria end-of-year singles charts and the Hottest 100 lists since the 1993 countdown (which was the first time Triple J restricted the vote only to songs in the previous year). I then compared the crossover between the two by programmatically matching the similarities in track titles and artists (this relies on a threshold for string similarity so might not be entirely accurate in a small number of cases). The same method was used to determine any appearance in the Aria charts. \nGenres were assigned using using Spotify‚Äôs API and taking the first two genres listed where available. Songs that had no genres listed were discarded. Genres were classified into five overall categories for the final chart. \n‚Ä¢ Download the Hottest 100 list here ‚Ä¢ Please contact me if I‚Äôve made a mistake with any part of the analysis", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T05:27:01.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
