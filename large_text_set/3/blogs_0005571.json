PTI | Posted by Samiya Latief Narindervir Singh said he was filming from inside his vehicle. Photo: Facebook Highlights Narindervir Singh said he was filming from inside his vehicle when the incident happened. 2 Singh streamed the video live on Facebook while he informed the man. 3 The man also made derogatory remarks about Punjabi people. \nAn Indian national in New Zealand was assaulted, subjected to a racist tirade and told to go back to his own country during a road rage incident in Auckland, a media report said today. \nNarindervir Singh said he was filming from inside his vehicle when the incident happened on a weekday last week. \nSingh streamed the video live on Facebook and while he informed the driver that he's uploading the video live, the situation escalated and Singh was abused, sworn at and told to go back to his own country. \nThe abuser, who is seen in video wearing a grey Everlast t-shirt, was tail-gating according to Singh, who says he simply pulled over to let him pass. The man also made derogatory remarks about Punjabi people, Newshub reported. As Singh drove off, the abuser exposed himself. \n\"It really shocked me and after he [left], I was really shaken,\" Newshub quoted Singh as saying. \"I don't know what to do, it really hurts my heart...The first thing in my mind was that he might hurt me with some weapon.\" \nWhen Singh left, he assumed it was all over. But when he parked on a nearby side street, he says the white Holden pulled up once again and the racist rant, including the 'n' word, continued. \nANOTHER RACIAL ATTACK \nAnother man, Bikramjit Singh, suffered similar abuse last week as he left a Papatoetoe storage facility. A man, who claimed Bikramjit was speeding, yelled at him saying: \"Go back to your country - slow down! You know what the speed limit is here.\" Bikramjit said he wasn't speeding, and has lived in New Zealand for more than a decade. \nThe man who hurled abuse in that case ended up apologising in an email, blaming two alcohol beverages he'd consumed earlier that day. But those who work with migrants say such discrimination do appear to be increasing. \n\"We are seeing it much more openly which is a very serious concern,\" said Anu Kaloti from the Migrant Workers Association. \"I think societies are becoming more and more intolerant, especially since (Donald) Trump was elected President of the US.\" Both men have filed complaints with police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T16:28:50.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
