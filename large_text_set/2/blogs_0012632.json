But why exactly does such a basic utensil need a revamp? Well, to combat the fast food chain’s new milkshake, which is a layered fifty-fifty combination of McDonald’s standard chocolate milkshake, with the minty seasonal favorite on top.\nThe goal of the updated straw is to shorten the wait time for the shake to melt a bit before you can get the desired mix of chocolate and mint flavors. A normal straw would only suction up one aspect of the milkshake at a time, leaving you missing out on the full culinary experience.\nEngineers from JACE Engineering and NK Labs in turn meticulously engineered the straw’s J-shaped snorkel design and side openings to suck in both layers simultaneously. According to McDonald’s, this new tubular design required some intricate computational fluid dynamics simulations in order to get the flow right and ensure the straw works just as well at the bottom of your shake as with the initial sip.\nMcDonald’s Chocolate Shamrock Shake was made available earlier this month, while the revamped straw is only available at selection locations when purchasing the shake.\nStay tuned in to McDonalds.com to learn where to find the straws.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:50:34.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
