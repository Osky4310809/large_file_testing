Chris Bryant makes an emotional plea for further action in pardoning gay men \nThe move caused an estimated 100,000 men to be drawn into legal proceedings between 1949 and 1969, with 50,000 convicted and some taking their own lives. \nHomosexuality was decriminalised in Germany 1969 but the legislation was not formally removed until 1994. \nSix years later, Germany's parliament approved a resolution regretting the fact that Paragraph 175 was retained after the war and in 2002 it annulled the convictions of gay men under Nazi rule, but not afterwards. \nThe new law will exclude men who were convicted for homosexual activities with children or for acts that involved violence or threats. \nIt also will apply to men convicted in communist East Germany, which had a milder version of Paragraph 175 on the books and decriminalised homosexuality in 1968. \nA total of around some 68,300 people were convicted under various forms of the law in both German states. \nMr Maas said the strength of a country was marked by the “courage to correct its own mistakes”, adding: “We have not just the right but the duty to act.” \nThe move comes months after the British government announced that thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted under now abolished sexual offences would be pardoned under the “Alan Turing law” . \nIt was named after the pioneering mathematician, whose code-breaking skills are said to have shortened the Second World War by years, who killed himself after being chemically castrated as punishment for “gross indecency”. \nSeveral other countries including Canada and New Zealand are considering pardons for those convicted under repealed laws against same-sex relationships.
