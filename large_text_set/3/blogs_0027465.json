Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFootball Association chairman Greg Clarke has condemned the \"inappropriate disrespectful and disappointing\" behaviour of some England supporters during last night's friendly against Germany in Dortmund. \nEngland's 1-0 defeat in Dortmund was marred by supporters booing the German national anthem and singing distasteful songs referencing the First and Second World Wars. \nClarke said: “The behaviour of a section of the England support in Dortmund last night was inappropriate, disrespectful and disappointing. FA Chairman condemns England fans (Photo: Jordan Mansfield) \n“The FA has consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others. Individuals who engage in such behaviour do not represent the overwhelming majority of England fans nor the values and identity we should aspire to as a football nation. \n“We are working with the England Supporters Travel Club and speaking with the Football Supporters’ Federation to come together to address this issue. \n“Everyone involved in the game has a responsibility to ensure that attending a football match is a safe and enjoyable experience for all.” \nThe encounter went ahead just hours after the devastating terror attack in London on Wednesday. England fans watch on - there is no suggestion those in the image were involved (Photo: REUTERS) \nA section of the travelling England support were heard singing the long-standing '10 German bombers' chant throughout the first-half. \nThe shameful chant has been used by Three Lions fans for years, in reference to World War II.
