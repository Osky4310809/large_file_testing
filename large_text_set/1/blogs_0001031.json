In a email to Gizmodo, a Tesla spokesperson claimed that before Son filed the suit—which seeks class action status—he “threatened to use his celebrity status in Korea to hurt Tesla” unless the company “agreed to make a financial payment and acknowledge that the vehicle accelerated on its own.” \nGizmodo has reached out to Tesla to ask about Son’s alleged threats.

Our policy is to stand by the evidence and not to give in to ultimatums.” Advertisement Advertisement \nJi-Chang Son starred in a slew of South Korean television shows and movies in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He is also a singer-songwriter. The Korean celebrity posted about the incident on his Facebook , detailing the events of the accident. According to a Google translation , Son wrote that after Tesla didn’t admit it was at fault, he began considering a lawsuit. \n“The article began to come up yesterday, and I came up with the answer that I demanded money because I was famous,” he wrote. “If the wall was concrete, not wood, I would [have died].” \nSon’s lawsuit cited seven other similar complaints against Tesla. The company maintained that in all these instances, the driver was at fault. Sponsored \nTesla contended it “protects against pedal misapplication on multiple levels” and that its software uses “the Autopilot sensor suite to distinguish potential pedal misapplication events from normal cases when a driver intentionally presses the accelerator pedal. In cases of unambiguous pedal misapplication, the vehicle cuts torque to mitigate the effects of the driver’s error.” \nThe lawsuit filed December 30 said that according to a study by NASA, between 2000 and 2010, the rate of sudden unintended acceleration (SUA) incidents was one in 100,000.
