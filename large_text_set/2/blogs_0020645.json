Two trainers anchored the strand-board base, like they had so many times before, as the 56-inch stack of stuff sat firmly in the middle of Landow Performance training facility in Centennial. \nA crowd gathered round, eyes peering between power racks and stationary bikes, and a camera settled into position. With a running start, Jalen Robinette lifted his knees to his shoulders as the camera rolled and a few claps echoed in the background. Atop the Tower of Stuff he landed, his head nearly grazing the tile ceiling. \nAs Robinette slowly stepped down, not even he realized that for a couple of seconds, amid the fanfare and gazes, he was for once just like the others — the other NFL combine invites spending these days and weeks training for their big test in Indianapolis later this month. \n“If you’re a good athlete on the field, all the combine does is it helps give them a barometer or maybe a platform to further subdivide talent level,” Landow explained. “And so they’ll say, ‘This guy can play football, man, we didn’t know how explosive he is and now we have an idea based on the 300 other prospects coming out or the prospects in his position.’ ” \nBut Robinette, try as he might, isn’t like the others. \nHis identities, for now, are split between Air Force cadet and NFL hopeful. The Academy’s all-time leading receiver still spends his mornings in the classroom, his afternoons at Landow’s facility and his evenings buried in the books to complete his degree in management. \n“My plate is still full, but I love it,” Robinette said. “I stay pretty busy. I’ve always looked at the big picture, which is pretty much why I came to the Academy.” CRITICAL DECISIONS Josh Conklin, Times Herald-Record via AP Air Force’s Jalen Robinette makes a catch during an NCAA college football game against Air Force in West Point, N.Y., Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016. \nGo on, ask him about the Space Shuttle Challenger. \n“That Critical Decisions in Space class I’m taking, we talk a lot about the management behind the Challenger,” Robinette said, his grin widening with every detail. “We actually dive into the recent history and get to talk about the choices and the decisions behind that, why we weren’t ready to launch with the Challenger. New information that’s recently been declassified. It’s really interesting.” \nCritical Decisions in Space is just one of Robinette’s six courses he’s balancing with his NFL draft prep. There’s also marketing and consulting and a project management course, a Military and Strategic Studies class and “Power and Influence in Organizations.” \nReally, a breeze. \nBut then again, Robinette was sold on the idea of it all years ago when he was a starter on the Bexley (Ohio) High football and basketball teams. \n“I can remember very plainly sitting down in his living room and just going through some of the challenges and difficulties that come with the Air Force Academy and seeing if he’d at least be interested in taking an official visit,” Air Force football coach Troy Calhoun recalled. “He said, ‘I think this might be something I want to do.’ ” \nRobinette’s decision had to factor in the offense as he made the switch from high school quarterback to college receiver. He’s the rare big-bodied wideout, standing 6-foot-3, 220 pounds. And at Air Force, he was one in a triple-option offense, much like Broncos star and Georgia Tech product Demaryius Thomas. \n“I knew I was in the right place, despite the stats,” Robinette said. “I’ve never really been huge on stats.” \nIn his four years at Air Force, Robinette totaled 120 catches for 2,697 yards (22.5 average) and 18 touchdowns. In 2016, he reached a career-high 959 yards, roughly 400 fewer than Clemson’s Mike Williams and more than 500 fewer than Western Michigan’s Corey Davis, both of whom are widely regarded as the top receiver prospects in the upcoming draft. \nRobinette’s numbers were not gaudy, nor should they have been in a running offense. But, boy, was he productive. \nAs he scaled Air Force’s ranks, he also led the nation with 27.4 yards per catch last season.
