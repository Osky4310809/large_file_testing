Well, because it's a Chinese company and in the Chinese language, the pronunciation of the number four is very close to the word for ‘death,’ so much so that the number four is almost equated with death. \nIn fact, the number four in Chinese culture is like the number 13 in Western countries. Many high-rise buildings and hotels in China do not have a 4th or 14th floor, and rooms with a 4 are often also omitted. The OnePlus 5 with ceramic housing? \nAccording to the latest rumors, the OnePlus 5 will have a ceramic or glass chassis. The ceramic option makes some sense, as OnePlus already has some experience thanks to the limited edition version of the OnePlus X . If it follows the same approach, it's more likely that the OnePlus 5 will only have a back plate made of ceramics, as was the case with the OnePlus X. \nThere are also suggestions that the OnePlus 5 will take a little inspiration from Samsung's S7 Edge design, and feature dual curved edges. The OnePlus 5 might get dual curved edges like the Samsung S7 Edge's. / © AndroidPIT Opinion by Shu On Kwok I like the curved edge trend What do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T16:27:48.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
