Joy Villa (Photo: Splash News) \nOn her Twitter bio, Villa describes herself as a feminist which came under fire given Trump's apparent views on women. \nHer Wikipedia page was also taken over soon after she walked the red carpet, with someone changing her stage name to 'Princess Trump'. (Photo: WireImage) \nAlso vying for the night's worst dressed award was CeeLo Green who arrived wearing what can only be described as some sort of C3PO tribute outfit.
