If you’re like me, and have kids, then you’ll get a great chuckle out of this video. It features Professor Robert Kelly during an interview with BBC news and, presumably, his kids.\nDuring the live broadcast, a kid strolls right into his dad’s office for some playtime. Dad’s on the computer, though, and tries to brush the little one away. Then the funniest moment happens – a little baby wheels him or herself right into the room, mother (or nanny?) hot on the heels.\nIt’s worth a watch, enjoy the quick chuckle.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T01:30:56.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
