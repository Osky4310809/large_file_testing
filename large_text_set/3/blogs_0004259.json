The AHRC handles complaints under a number of acts, including the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act, the Age Discrimination Act and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act. \nHere are the number of complaints under each act for the past 10 years – this shows all complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act, not just those relating to section 18C: complaints handled by the AHRC \nOn average, there were about 418 racial discrimination complaints a year. \nWithin those racial discrimination complaints, there were still fewer complaints that specifically related to section 18C, with only 77 in the last financial year: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:44:10.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
