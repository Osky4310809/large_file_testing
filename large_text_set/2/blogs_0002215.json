Fifteen reps or more is the standard in the Church of Bobby Maximus. My record is 36 reps. \nCan’t bench 225? No problem. Use a bar that weighs equal to your bodyweight. If you weigh 150 pounds, for example, use a bar that weighs 150 (or lighter, if need be). Make sure the bar touches your chest at the bottom, and your arms lock out at the top. \nBobby Maximus is the training director of Gym Jones, one of the country’s most elite and hardcore gyms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:13:29.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
