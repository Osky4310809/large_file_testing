SHARE Nick Kyrgios has scored his second successive win over Novak Djokovic. Photo: AP \nKyrgios struck 14 aces, 25 winners and didn't face a single break point in repeating his victory over the 12-times grand slam champion in Mexico earlier this month. \nEyeing his third semi-final showing in as many tournaments, the Australian No.1 is yet to drop serve in three matches this week. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Stretched: Novak Djokovic earned a code violation for smashing his racquet at the end of the first set. Photo: AP \nDjokovic had been riding a four-year, 20-match winning streak in the Californian desert and hailed his third-set display against Juan Martin del Potro in the previous round as his best tennis of the year. \nBut he had no answer to Kyrgios's awesome firepower and sublime touch, the champion Serb obliterating his racquet after losing the first set and constantly berating himself as the match slipped away. Advertisement \nKyrgios made a flying start, breaking Djokovic in the opening game of the match. \nHe was utterly untroubled on his own serve until Djokovic dug in to win the longest rally of the match, a 33-point slugfest, to have Kyrgios under pressure at 15-30 trying to close out the first set. \nKyrgios was more than up for the challenge, though, showing impressive foot speed and brilliant hands to mow down a Djokovic drop volley and whip a running crosscourt pass in front of the Serb. \nThe Australian followed up with his seventh ace to clinch the set and draw a code violation from his frustrated foe. \nDjokovic upped the ante in the second set, but Kyrgios again had all the answers, breezing through the tiebreaker to advance in just one two hours. \nKyrgios beat Federer in their only previous meeting, in Madrid two years ago, and is 1-1 head-to-head with Nadal. \nIn other fourth-round matches, Pablo Cuevas upset 11th seed David Goffin 6-3 3-6 6-3, Pablo Carreno beat Dusan Lajovic 6-4 7-6 (7-5) and fourth seed Kei Nishikori cruised past Donald Young 6-2 6-4. \nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T02:56:39.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
