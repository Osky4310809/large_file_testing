Supplied THE NRL community has turned out to celebrate the life of former NRL star Chad Robinson who died last year after a battle with depression. \nPast and present Parramatta Eels and Sydney Roosters greats are among the mourners at Parramatta Marist High for the service this morning. \nFor his old Roosters comrades, the journey was a long one, a group gathered together on a minibus for this trip deep into Eels country, among them Brad Fittler, Ryan Cross, Craig Fitzgibbon and Luke Rickettson, joining Eels mates such as Eric Groethe, Nathan Cayless and Mark Michael. \nWelcoming mourners, Father Paul Marshall noted Chad’s depression, ongoing problems relating form concussions from his playing days and uncertain income from his job as a finance broker and all the challenges they presented \n“Who can truly understand how he felt,” Father Marshall asked. “It seems that life got on top of him and he got tired of life.” \n“Chad’s death poses many questions abut raising awareness of mental issues.” \nBut Father Marshall said the numbers of those presents showed just how much he meant to people. \n“The love and esteem with which he was held are reflected in the numbers gathered here,” he said. \nHis teenage children, Kiara and Cooper, penned a “thank you” letter to their dad, describing him as their closest companion. \n“Words cannot express how broken-hearted we are that you were taken so early from us but we know you are at peace and resting easy now,” the pair wrote in a letter printed in the order of service. \n“Until we see you again, know that we adore you, Daddy. Forever loving you.” \nThe 36-year-old father of two’s body was found in a car at Kenthurst in northwest Sydney on December 22, after he’d been missing for weeks following a long battle with depression. \nThe former Parramatta and Sydney Roosters forward played 159 NRL matches between 2000 and 2008. \nThe Eels and the Roosters have set up an education fund to help Robinson’s children, Kiara and Cooper. \nThe GoFundMe crowd-funding campaign has so far raised more than $24,000. \nAustralian readers seeking support and information about depression can contact the Depression Helpline (from 8am to midnight) on 0800 111 757.
