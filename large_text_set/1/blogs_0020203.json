Sorry, LeBron. The Box \nThis is the best-case scenario when someone sees this shoebox in your house: \nFriend: “Is that shoebox made of wood?” \nYou: “Yes, it’s made out of the court at Quicken Loans Arena.” \nFriend: [long silence] \nYou: “That’s where LeBron and the Cavs won the championship.” \nFriend: “Oh! Yeah that’s cool man.” \nNot a $2,000 conversation. The Ring \nUnequivocally, no. This is corny. The ring isn’t even made out of real gold and diamonds, which would actually make the exorbitant price tag a much better bargain. Instead, it’s made from durilium metal and cubic zircon. Like items at the pharmacy, ingredients on a Cheetos bag, and protein supplements from Eastern Europe, purchases of things you can’t pronounce is not a good idea, and not worth $2,000. All together though? \nLook, the one thing you’re going to use from this box is the shoes, and they’re just not cool enough to warrant dropping a couple Gs.
