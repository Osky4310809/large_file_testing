Not even on a secret island in Queensland .\nBut when the popstar tried to sit down for lunch at Sydney chicken joint, Chargrill Charlie's on Friday afternoon (you know, as normal people do) but became obvious just how much it would suck to be him.\nSEE ALSO: Justin Bieber is sick of overeager fans, and he ain't afraid to say so\nHe was met by a large gang of fans, who police kept at bay while he ate. Undeterred, they just stood there — staring at him while he ate his chicken and greens. It looks like the saddest lunch ever.\nProbably the first time I've felt sorry for Justin Bieber. The poor guy can't even go for chicken without a mob of baying fans tailing him. pic.twitter.com/yzgLYr24y2\n— Joe Ellison (@Chevychased) March 17, 2017\nSaw Justin Bieber eating lunch. First time I've felt bad for the guy.

But who'd actually want to be a celebrity?\nMiss you Dennis\nA post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Mar 17, 2017 at 2:59am PDT\nNot us, mate.\nWATCH: Forget dance classes, these smart shoes can teach you all the best moves", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/pixelhazard/status/842619024966008832", "https://t.co/lZkVe1fvsi", "https://t.co/gKoqG76wHK", "https://twitter.com/godstanbieber/status/842652365542981632", "https://twitter.com/godstanbieber/status/842641959218962432", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRvC5GSjSna/", "https://t.co/yzgLYr24y2", "https://t.co/wGelKVVaHS", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/VC1sVvgz.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/VC1sVvgz.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/JBCGiveaway/status/842623486849773568", "https://twitter.com/Chevychased/status/842785500469608448"], "published": "2017-03-20T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T08:25:20.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
