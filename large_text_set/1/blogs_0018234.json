Cameron sold the rights to the sci-fi classic to Hurd for $1 back in the 80s so he could direct the films. But now, the copyright reversion has just kicked in. And rumor has it that Cameron just may be bringing a very special director along for another reboot.\nIt’s been more than a decade since the last of the original Terminator trilogy hit the big screen. Of course, there have been a few newer Terminator movies. Big names like Emilia Clarke and Christian Bale were both involved with those Terminator reboots. But those sequels – even with the big name draws and the return of Arnold Schwarzeneggar to the iconic role – never really got the same support as the original franchise.\nBut fans may not have to wait much longer for a new official flick of the storyline from the original creator himself.\nCameron is supposedly in talks to have the new movies be helmed by Deadpool director, Tim Miller! \nIn case you’re unfamiliar, James Cameron is responsible for some of our favorite American classics. And having him back for the newest Terminator film would mean so much to life-long franchise fans.\nAs if that’s not great enough, adding the creative genius of famed director Tim Miller could upgrade Terminator to the next level. \nCameron has a lot on his plate as of now. Avatar’s 2-5 are all currently in pre-production stages. So a plan for Terminator has yet to be set in stone. But, that doesn’t stop us from fawning over all of the possibilities, and spewing of pure excitement and optimism!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:11:27.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
