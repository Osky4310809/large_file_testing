In order to scoop babes, the 26-year-old relies on his boyish charm and the fact that he’s one of the biggest pop stars in the fucking world. I probably should have put the second part first.\nBut we’re not talking just any girls, we’re talking the certified 10s–including, but not limited to, former Pussy Cat Dolls lead singer Nicole Scherzinger . If you need a refresher, Nicole is an absolute scud missile.\n\nIn a recent profile by Rolling Stone , Ed told us what we already know: it’s easy to get chicks when you can play the ‘pop star’ card. Sheeran speaks particularly about the 66-date run opening for Swift, in which women made themselves…available.\nOffstage, this was his most romantically prolific period. He says he hooked up with some of Swift’s famous friends. “Taylor’s world is celebrity,” says Sheeran. “I was this 22-year-old awkward British kid going on tour with the biggest artist in America, who has all these famous mates. It was very easy. … I would often find myself in situations just kind of waking up and looking over and being like, ‘How the fuck did that happen?’ ” (Katy Perry recently summed up his appeal as a secret ladies’ man: “Everybody loves him, no one’s scared of him, they want to date him. They can have him.”)\nI choose to believe he’s speaking about one or seven of these ladies.\n\nRolling Stone brings attention to Ed getting the hoes before bros treatment while on tour.\nHe wrote “Don’t” about a fling with a fellow pop star that ends when he learns she’s had sex with a friend who was staying on the same hotel floor. Many speculated it was Ellie Goulding, who afterward released “On My Mind,” which included the burn “You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos.” Goulding has denied having ever been involved with Sheeran.\nEd is currently in a relationship with a former Duke field hockey player and Sheeran’s high school pal, Cherry. Good on you for trying out the life of the average Joe, Ed. I’d be more than happy to swap places with you.\n[h/t Rolling Stone ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:56:51.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
