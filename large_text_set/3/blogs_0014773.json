Today we'll dissect Mr. Crowley by Ozzy Osbourne. Enjoy!\n\nWriters: Ozzy Osbourne, Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley Producers: Ozzy Osbourne, Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake Album: Blizzard of Ozz (UG Score 9.6) Recorded: 22 March – 19 April 1980 Released: 20 September 1980 Genre: Heavy metal, Doom metal Length: 4:55 Story behind the song \nThe song was inspired by a book about Aleister Crowley which Osbourne had read and a deck of tarot cards that were found in the studio as the recording of the album was commencing. Crowley was an English occultist and ceremonial magician who had founded the Thelemite religion in the early 20th century. Aleister Crowley was an infamous poet, writer, mountain climber, and Adept. Also known as the Master Therion and the Great Beast 666, he is widely considered to be the most influential Occultist of all time, he gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, and was denounced in the popular press of the day as \"the wickedest man in the world.\" \nThe song helped Ozzy play up his mock-Satanic image, which he often did for effect. This his something he did in his band Black Sabbath, who likened their music to horror movies. Ozzy mispronounces Crowley's last name. It is in fact pronounced with the first syllable sounding like \"crow\" in English. When Crowley was born they scattered the afterbirth because he had a birthmark shaped like a swastika. Ozzy sings about it in the line \"They scattered the afterbirth.\" \nIn the liner notes for The Ozzman Cometh, Ozzy wrote: I'd read several books about Aleister Crowley. He was a very weird guy and I always wanted to write a song about him. While we were recording the Blizzard of Ozz album there was a pack of tarot cards he had designed lying around the studio. Well one thing lead to another and the song 'Mr. Crowley' was born. \nA live version of this song was released as the second single from the album, following \"Crazy Train.\" This version was taken from a performance on October 2, 1980 when Ozzy and his band played the Mayflower Theatre in Southampton on their first UK tour. In the UK, the single was backed with the song \"You Said It All\" (taken from the same performance), which was not available on the album. In America, the single was released as an EP which also included a performance of \"Suicide Solution\" from that show. \nRandy Rhoads played guitar on this track and co-wrote it with Ozzy and Bob Daisley. \"Mr. Crowley\" is a great example of both his striking guitar technique and creative riff-making, skills that helped Ozzy escape the long shadow of Black Sabbath and establish a solo career. Rhoads worked on two albums with Ozzy before his untimely death in 1982 at age 25. Rhoads died during a tour stop when he went up in a small plane and the pilot started buzzing the tour bus, trying to get a rise out of Osbourne, who was in it. The plane lost control and crashed, killing Rhoads, the pilot, and the tour hairdresser. Music Videos \nLive at the O2 Arena, London, UK in 2010. Notable covers \nYngwie Malmsteen and Tim Owens - \"Mr. Crowley\" \nCradle of Filth - \"Mr. Crowley\" Gear and settings \nRandy Rhoads \n1979 Karl Sandoval Flying V \nFew month before the break-up of the Quiet Riot, Randy visited Karl Sandoval's guitar workshop and ordered a custom built guitar based on his own ideas and sketches. The guitar was finished in September 1979, and Randy paid a total of $740 for it. \nThe KS Flying V was finished in black with white polka-dots all over the body and neck. The hardware was originally chrome from Fender, but it was replaced with black, and the guitar was equipped with a DiMarzio Distortion Plus in the bridge position and a DiMarzio PAF in the neck. \nShortly after Randy received the guitar, the unusually-shaped headstock broke after the guitar fell on the ground accidentally, but it was soon replaced and re-painted. The whole neck was supposedly originally taken from a ’60s Danelectro guitar and didn’t have a truss rod, so Randy struggled to keep it in tune. Nonetheless, he played this guitar very often live, and, according to Max Norman, who produced the album, Randy used a polka-dot Charvel on pretty much all the guitar tracks, but Karl Sandoval V was the only polka-dot guitar that Randy owned at that time, so Max was probably talking about this guitar. \nBob Daisley \nBob Daisley used white Gibson EB-3 (UG Score 8.6) during the recording of the album \"Blizzard of Ozz.\" Amps and effects \nAfter joining Ozzy, Randy switched to Marshall. On stage he would use up to three amps, each played through a set of 1960A and 1960B cabinets, both painted white. Yeah, a straight 100, a real nice sound, actually. Both cabinets plugged in and stacked up too. We tried it a number of different ways. I prefer the Marshalls with both cabinets, and stacked. They have a somewhat different sound than if there’s just one sitting on the floor, - Max Norman. \nMarshall 1959 Super Lead Plexi 100W Head (with the \"Cascade\" mod) \nMarshall 4x12 Cabinets loaded with Altec 417-8H speakers \nHe was definitely a Marshall man when it came time to plug in and while he didn’t use too many pedals, MXR seemed to be his choice for chorus and distortion. \nRandy Rhoads told on a seminar in 1982 : I have a pedalboard that’s got an MXR Distortion +, an MXR 10-band equalizer, a chorus, an MXR stereo chorus, an MXR flanger, a Crybaby wah pedal and a Roland volume pedal. I used them much more in the past than I do nowadays, but now our sound man is starting to add a lot more up front. Sometimes I use them more for quiet rhythm parts, just to enhance the sound. I never use echoes or anything for leads. \nMXR Distortion Plus (UG Score 9.4) The MXR Distortion Plus is the only gadget I use a lot, - Randy Rhoads. \nThere some misconceptions about using chorus and flanger pedals for the recording, but it's known that Randy used double or even triple-tracking anything he played, for maximum sonic density. \nFor live performances Rhoads used more complex rig: \nRandy Rhoads live rig in 1981.
