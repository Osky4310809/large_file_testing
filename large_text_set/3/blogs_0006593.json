Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com TownNews.com Content Exchange \nJUPITER, Fla. • A recent tweet showed a pic of Harrison Bader and Mags Sierra, and the tweet asked the Twitterverse: “We know the Cardinals' center fielder of the present — is one of these men the center fielder of the future?” \nSure enough, Dexter Fowler himself saw the tweet and playfully responded: “Too soon!” \nIndeed, Dexter plans to patrol center for many years, but here at spring training, there is a galvanized giddiness about the Cards' litany of center field prospects, with Bader arguably the closest to cracking the bigs. \nThe organization of Curt Flood, Willie McGee, Ray Lankford and Jim Edmonds is at it again. \n“There's a lot of talent, so it's important to understand that stuff is out of control,” said Bader, the 22-year-old former Florida Gator. “And you've got to do what you've got to do to get into the lineup, whether it's center or a corner (outfield position) or wherever.” \nFowler, who flirted with a .400 on-base percentage last season, is one of the better center fielders in baseball. Bader had a flashy stat line in Class AA last season — a .283 batting average with a .351 on-base percentage and a .497 slugging percentage. His numbers dipped in Memphis, but he'll likely start the season there. \nBelow him is Sierra, the glitzy speedster who is still growing as a hitter, but could play the field in the bigs today. And there's Randy Arozarena, a Cuban talent in the organization. Oh, and there's Adolis Garcia, the big get. Adolis signed this February and hasn't played in games yet – still waiting on his visa – but has the talent, it seems, to play in Springfield or Memphis. \nOn MLB.com 's list of Cards prospects, Bader is fifth, Sierra seventh and Arozarena 15th (Garcia is too new of a signing to be ranked). \nAs for Bader, he thrived in the fall for the Glendale Desert Dogs. At the Arizona Fall League, he hit .304 and didn't make an error in the outfield. Here in Jupiter, he's 5-for-16 (.313) with five RBIs. He had a triple against the Mets this past weekend, swatting an outside fastball – “As soon as I saw (Curtis) Granderson's number, I was sniffing a triple,” said Bader, who grew up about an hour from Citi Field. \nThis is the kid's first big-league camp, “And I've been exposed to a lot of new eyes,” Bader said. “So I'm just trying to soak all that up every day and just go out there and have some fun.” \n“You've always got to be evolving and changing,” Bader said Tuesday from the Cards' clubhouse. “For the most part, I worked on just quieting things down. Just in the box. From your load to whatever mechanism you use to kind of get ready to get yourself in a hitting position. I've just tried to have as little movement as possible. Obviously in Triple-A the ball moves a little bit more, it's a higher level and you're getting closer to the big leagues. So they're always changing speeds, changing locations, so with that, you've kind of got to change as a hitter. So in this offseason, I went into it just trying to quiet that down. \n“(The hitting coaches) have been helping me a lot, just keeping your angles, understanding what you have to do to get in the best hitting position as possible – and as consistently as possible. The important thing I'm beginning to understand from them is – you can take a good swing, but you've got to know how you got to that position, so you can repeat it. That's the whole process – the consistency.” \nBenjamin Hochman", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:00:07.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
