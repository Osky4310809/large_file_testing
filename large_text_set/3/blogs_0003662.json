He was an undrafted free agent after the 2016 NFL Draft. The 6-foot-7 collegiate standout was considered a “pro-style quarterback” and set a program record with 75 total touchdowns at Utah. We could not be happier for @TravisWilson_7 who just signed with the @RamsNFL . His transition to TE was months of hard work & dedication #gp pic.twitter.com/9kaHP98S4T \n— Paradigm Sports Mgmt (@ParadigmSM) March 1, 2017 \nHere’s what Utah football coach Kyle Whittingham said about Wilson ( via ESPN ): \n“Obviously we only had experience with him as a quarterback and that’s all he ever played for us. He won a lot of games for us. But that’s a good question, where he fits in at the next level? There are probably a couple of places that would be possibilities outside of quarterback. He’s got the big frame. He’s got great hands. He can catch very well. That’s interesting if someone can put 10-20 pounds on his frame and make him a tight end.” \nThe same report explains that he also played wide receiver and linebacker early in high school. \nWilson was set to play quarterback for the North Coast Heat in Australia , but that league never actually began. \nBelow are all of the rushing touchdowns that Wilson recorded while in college, which shows off his versatile athleticism.
