Abbey Clancy dobbed in husband Peter Crouch (Photo: Getty Images) \n\"I know he missed the Champions League final or whatever it was last year to watch the final of Top Model. \n\"I was like Pete, you’ve got to watch the final, you’ve watched the whole series.\" \nNow there's a problem with this claim, and it's not Crouch's taste in entertainment.
