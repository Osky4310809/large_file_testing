The 26-year-old underwent surgery and will miss the rest of the season. \nHe did however post on Instagram to say he's still working on his fitness. \nBrooklyn Nets provided the striker with a personalised jersey for the game against the Detroit Pistons. \nThe Nets ran out 98-96 winners with Gabriel in New York to continue his recovery from a metatarsal injury. poll loading Will Gabriel Jesus one day win the Ballon d'Or? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:08:53.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
