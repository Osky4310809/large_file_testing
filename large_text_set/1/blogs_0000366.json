The injured were rushed to the FC hospital.\nPolice and FC personnel reached the site and started investigation into the incident.\nThere has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.\nIn November last year, three FC officials were killed and seven others were injured in a roadside improvised explosive device (IED) blast which occurred near their vehicle in Peshawar's Bashirabad area.\nThe number of attacks in the country has fallen around 70 per cent, due to a combination of the military offensive against Taliban bases along the Afghan border and government initiatives to tackle militancy, but attacks on security and civilian targets continue to occur occasionally.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T08:35:30.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
