'We took the strike'”, he tweeted. Earlier, the reporter claimed the US Central Command told him the Americans conducted a strike on a target just several miles away, in the bordering Idlib province, and was looking into the Aleppo suburb mosque strike.

Josh Jacques, told the London-based Airwars monitoring group that the target was “assessed to be a meeting place for al Qaeda, and we took the strike.” \n“It happened to be across the street from where there is a mosque,” said Jacques, specifying that the mosque was not the target and that it wasn’t hit directly. \n“To be clear: this was a unilateral US strike, not part of anti-ISIS Coalition activities,” Oakford emphasized in another tweet. \nMeanwhile Sakir Khader, who identifies himself as a journalist with a focus on Syria, Turkey, and the wider Middle East, posted a picture of the missile debris, which he claims to have come from the rubble of the destroyed mosque.

According to a Bellingcat investigation, the photo could depict an AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-surface missiles. There is also a theory that the missile could have been launched by a drone. #pts : Note that AGM-114 Hellfire missiles use the same color & font.Compare stock photo (left) to image from Al-Jinah tonight (right). pic.twitter.com/lx3ecGv3hS — Charles Lister (@Charles_Lister) March 16, 2017 \n“Perhaps even more noteworthy is that the exact same label on a weapon remnant was found at the site of an alleged drone strike on a high value target (HVT) in Syria’s Idlib province in October 2016,\" the Bellingcat report says. \nNeither the Russian nor the US militaries, as well as Damascus, have yet to officially comment on the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:33:12.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
