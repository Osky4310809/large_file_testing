God the Father ordained the institution of marriage and designed for us to live within families. Whether we're talking about friendships , dating relationships , marriages, families, or dealings between brothers and sisters in Christ, the Bible has a great deal to say about our relationships with one another. Dating Relationships \nGuard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life. (NLT) \nSong of Solomon 4:9 You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace. (ESV) \nRomans 12:1–2 Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. (NASB) \n1 Corinthians 6:18 Run from sexual sin ! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body. (NLT) \n1 Corinthians 15:33 Do not be deceived: \"Bad company ruins good morals.\" (ESV) \n2 Corinthians 6:14–15 Don't team up with those who are unbelievers. How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness? What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil? How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever? (NLT) \n1 Timothy 5:1b-2 ...Talk to younger men as you would to your own brothers. Treat older women as you would your mother, and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters. (NLT) Husband and Wife Relationships \nGenesis 2:18–25 Then the LORD God said, \"It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.\" ... So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. \nThen the man said, \"This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\" Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed. (ESV) \nProverbs 31:10–11 Who can find a virtuous and capable wife? She is more precious than rubies. Her husband can trust her, and she will greatly enrich his life. (NLT) \nMatthew 19:5 ...and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh' ... (NKJV) \n1 Corinthians 7:1–40 ...Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control ... Read entire text . (NKJV) \nEphesians 5:23–33 For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church , his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her ... In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself ... and let the wife see that she respects her husband. Read entire text . (ESV) \n1 Peter 3:7 In the same way, you husbands must give honor to your wives. Treat your wife with understanding as you live together. She may be weaker than you are, but she is your equal partner in God's gift of new life. Treat her as you should so your prayers will not be hindered. (NLT) Family Relationships \nExodus 20:12 \"Honor your father and mother. Then you will live a long, full life in the land the LORD your God is giving you.\" (NLT) \nLeviticus 19:3 \"Each of you must respect his mother and father, and you must observe my Sabbaths. I am the LORD your God.\" (NIV) \nDeuteronomy 5:16 \"Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the LORD your God is giving you.\" (NIV) \nPsalm 127:3 Children are a gift from the LORD; they are a reward from him. (NLT) \nProverbs 31:28–31 Her children stand and bless her. Her husband praises her: \"There are many virtuous and capable women in the world, but you surpass them all!\" Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last; but a woman who fears the LORD will be greatly praised. Reward her for all she has done. Let her deeds publicly declare her praise. (NLT) \nJohn 19:26–27 When Jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved, he said to her, \"Dear woman, here is your son.\" And he said to this disciple, \"Here is your mother.\" And from then on this disciple took her into his home. (NLT) \nEphesians 6:1–3 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. \"Honor your father and mother,\" which is the first commandment with promise: \"that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.\" (NKJV) Friendships \nA friend loves at all times, And a brother is born for adversity. (NKJV) \nProverbs 18:24 There are \"friends\" who destroy each other, but a real friend sticks closer than a brother. (NLT) \nProverbs 27:6 Wounds from a sincere friend are better than many kisses from an enemy. (NLT) \nProverbs 27:9–10 The heartfelt counsel of a friend is as sweet as perfume and incense. Never abandon a friend -- either yours or your father's. When disaster strikes, you won't have to ask your brother for assistance. It's better to go to a neighbor than to a brother who lives far away. (NLT) General Relationships and Brothers and Sisters in Christ \nEcclesiastes 4:9–12 Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble. Likewise, two people lying close together can keep each other warm. But how can one be warm alone? A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken. (NLT) \nMatthew 5:38–42 \"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.\" (ESV) \nMatthew 6:14–15 For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. (ESV) \nMatthew 18:15–17 \"If another believer sins against you, go privately and point out the offense. If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back. But if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others with you and go back again, so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses. If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church. Then if he or she won't accept the church's decision, treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector .\" (NLT) \n1 Corinthians 6:1–7 When one of you has a dispute with another believer, how dare you file a lawsuit and ask a secular court to decide the matter instead of taking it to other believers! Don't you realize that someday we believers will judge the world? And since you are going to judge the world, can't you decide even these little things among yourselves? Don't you realize that we will judge angels? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life. \nIf you have legal disputes about such matters, why go to outside judges who are not respected by the church? I am saying this to shame you. Isn't there anyone in all the church who is wise enough to decide these issues? But instead, one believer sues another -- right in front of unbelievers! Even to have such lawsuits with one another is a defeat for you. Why not just accept the injustice and leave it at that? Why not let yourselves be cheated? (NLT) \nGalatians 5:13 For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. (ESV) \n1 Timothy 5:1–3 Never speak harshly to an older man, but appeal to him respectfully as you would to your own father. Talk to younger men as you would to your own brothers. Treat older women as you would your mother, and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters. Take care of any widow who has no one else to care for her. (NLT) \nHebrews 10:24 And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works ... (NKJV) \n1 John 3:1 See how very much our Father loves us, for he calls us his children, and that is what we are! But the people who belong to this world don't recognize that we are God's children because they don't know him.
