Cool, right? But, wait, there’s a plot twist: Cate Blanchett decided to do drag as Cate Blanchett . Lol wait, what? Stay with us — we promise she’s not a raging narcissist . The Hollywood star hit the stage at a fundraiser for the Newtown Action Alliance (which advocates for safer gun laws in honor of the Sandy Hook massacre victims and their families ) and lip-synced a song to raise awareness for their cause. Not only do we love that Cate is using her notoriety for good, but we also love that she’s pretty awesome at drag. Also, only an icon like Cate can do drag as…herself. Bow down.\nHer song choice? The Dusty Springfield cover of “You Don’t Own Me” — the one from The First Wives Club ! Swoon.\nHow good is she?!\nThere she goes #CateBlanchett #NYC \nA post shared by Rocío López (@clorofila_s) on Feb 20, 2017 at 11:48pm PST \nLol. Yes.\nEverything I didnt know I needed Cate for a fundraiser to end gun violence. #Repost @therealmicahfrank with @repostapp ・・・ happy presidents' day. special thank you to the birthday boy george washington for helping to create this great country where cate blanchett can perform in drag show #cateblanchett \nA post shared by Cate Blanchett Fanpage (@be.my.carol) on Feb 20, 2017 at 8:06pm PST \nLove it so much.\nShe later joined a few other women on stage in a “pussy hat” — remember those pink hats people, like Cate herself, were rocking at the Women’s March ? — to lip-sync “Hello” by Adele. The lyrics were tweaked to address gun laws, such as, “When I call Paul Ryan, he never seems to be home.” BLOOP.\n#cateblanchett #badass #picoftheday \nA post shared by @dansunsourire on Feb 22, 2017 at 8:32am PST \n#cateblanchett #margeauxpowell @newtownactionalliance @thestonewallinn \nA post shared by Stonewall (@thestonewallinn) on Feb 20, 2017 at 6:20pm PST \nYou can check out the full video of her solo performance here:\nThis is hardly the first time we’ve seen Cate come out in support of others in need. She is a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, started a charity called Clear for Life that helps raise money to provide safe drinking water to developing regions of Asia, is a fierce advocate and supporter of the arts, and has spoken on behalf of the Salvation Army.\nWe’re glad Cate is using her sense of humor to help advocate for safer gun laws.
