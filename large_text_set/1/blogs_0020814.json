To the right wing, he hasn't gone far enough Topics: border wall , Donald Trump , Dream Act , illegal immigration , Immigration , News , Politics News (Credit: AP Photo/Russell Contreras) \nPresident Donald Trump sent out a Tuesday night tweet that foreshadowed a big day for immigration reform on Wednesday. Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 \nThe president is expected to sign an executive order to begin construction on the wall while visiting the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday. It remains to be seen how Trump will address the myriad logistical issues surrounding the wall’s construction, including its cost, length, feasibility, the starting date of construction, and who will ultimately pay for it. \nLater this week, Trump is expected to further please his conservative base on immigration by paring down a program that helps people from vulnerable countries receive refuse in the United States and beefing up screening methods. \nThat said, he may need to do more to appease his diehard conservative backers. One big sticking point : The fact that Trump hasn’t ordered federal officials to stop accepting applications for DREAMers — hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrant children who were protected from deportation by the Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals act. \n“It was front and center in his campaign,” Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, told Politico . “Donald Trump got a lot of votes — probably got the Republican nomination in large part — because he said he was going to be aggressive in defending our borders. One of the low-lying fruits is repealing, by executive order, the amnesty executive orders of Barack Obama, and he hasn’t done it yet.” Matthew Rozsa is a breaking news writer for Salon.
