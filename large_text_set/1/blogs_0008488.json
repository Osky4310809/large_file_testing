Just like Nabil [Fekir] and Corentin [Tolisso] and all the other players for whom we have received offers. We have six or seven offers on the table for our best players. \n\"We have the intention to close the gap with the teams at the top of the table in Ligue 1 and to go far in the Europa League because this could be an opportunity for us.\" \nAulas also claims that Serie A champions Juventus have made an approach for midfielder Tolisso. \nOFFICIAL: Cohen Bramall joins Arsenal \n\"There has been contact with Juventus, but nothing is happening this winter,\" Aulas added. \n\"We have not made any commitments for the summer, but it is true that Juventus have followed up their interest.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T17:16:29.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
