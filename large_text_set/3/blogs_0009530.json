Neither Meyers nor federal One Nation MPs responded to questions about her views at the time.\nBut when faced on Thursday with a reporter from Out in Perth – the West Australian LGBT news website that broke the story – Meyers finally spoke on the issue.\nAt a function with party leader Pauline Hanson at the Mount Hawthorn pub, Meyers told Out in Perth they had “trolled her big time”.\n\n“I never said that,” she said. “I was misquoted, you never looked into any of the references that I put up and I was told that you were out to bag me because I don’t support your view.”\nAsked if she stood by her implication that same-sex parented families are “fake families”, Meyers said: “Yeah, they are, they’re fake families.”\nView this image › \nFacebook: Michelle Meyers \nID: 10676685 Here is what Meyers wrote on Facebook in full:\n\n“Are you wondering why even some Christians are being swayed by the gender industry’s pitch and push 4 same sex ‘marriage’ and acceptance of fake families?\n“It’s not by accident; it’s by a carefully contrived but disingenuous mind control program, melded together by two Norwegian homosexuals who graduated from Harvard – one whom has since prematurely passed away. It’s by a design covert to the general public but fully practiced and promoted by the LGBTIQQMA/P community.\n“Utilising many of the strategies developed by the Soviets and then the Nazis, they have gone on to apply and perfect these principles so as to make them universal in their application – but with devastating results considering the counter productive nature of such ‘unions’.\n“It’s time 4 Christians to wake up to what’s going and stop being duped by those whose interests are self serving but unnatural, unproductive and unhealthy. It’s time to stop aiding and abetting those whose intent is to further mar the image of those created by God to reflect HIS image – NOT a broken and fake identity cobbled together by the gender industry.”\nIn the same post, she linked out to an article titled Why Have So Many Christians and Churches Become Pro-Gay?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T07:19:09.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
