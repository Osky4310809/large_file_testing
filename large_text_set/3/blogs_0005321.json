Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe title may be looking beyond them but Dele Alli wants his Tottenham side back in the Champions League. \nThe north Londoners host Everton on Sunday, with Ronald Koeman’s Toffees fired up by their own pursuit of a top-six finish. \nMidfielder Alli , however, believes second-placed Spurs have unfinished business in European football’s elite competition after failing to live up to expectations in it this season after a return to the top table following six years of Europa League football. \nWith a huge new stadium under construction and manager Mauricio Pochettino’s consistent side confirming last season’s promise, Alli believes Tottenham are ready to show that they can live with the best teams in the world.

So it’ll be disappointing if we don’t get back in there. \n“We’re kicking ourselves that we didn’t do better. We are confident in our ability as a team and we probably expected to go a bit further. \n“As a kid, everyone wants to play in the Champions League so it was an honour to be in it. We have the team to achieve a lot of great things. We want to be up there with the best teams in the world. But to do that we have to be in the Champions League, playing against them. \n“It’s important that we are ambitious. We know where we should be and we know what we can do as a team. \n“When we are on form and playing well, I don’t think there is anyone in the Premier League that can beat us.

There’s nothing we can’t do if we play as well as we know we can. \n“We’ve got to learn from every game. Hopefully in the future, maybe even this season, we’ll start winning trophies.” \nInjuries to key players such as Harry Kane and Toby Alderweireld wrecked their Champions League campaign, but Alli has refused to blame either the absences or the move to Wembley — where he got sent off last week during their Europa League exit against Gent. \nSpeaking in the April edition of FourFourTwo magazine, he added: “A lot of people were saying, 'The Wembley factor' had a negative effect on us. But as a team we can’t look anywhere else. All of those fans turned up and we simply didn’t put in the performances that we knew we should have done.” \nAlli and Kane have both been key in recent weeks to maintaining Tottenham’s push for a top four place and their momentum in the FA Cup.

It’s an honour to play with a striker like that. \n“His all-round play is fantastic. He holds the ball up and can bring other players into the game as well as score. \n\"He works so hard too — if you do play him a bad ball, he’ll work hard to make it a good one.” poll loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:52:13.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
