Having just wrapped up a collaboration on the all-conquering NMD , adidas Originals has unveiled another silhouette designed in tandem with BAPE — only this time they’ve brought along fellow streetwear giant Neighborhood for the ride.\nThe trio has come up with a modern-day revamp of the classic Superstar silhouette, which comes reinforced with Boost and sock-fit Primeknit technology for the first time. Up top, premium suede overlays are contrasted with black details, including a serrated Three Stripes and embroidered BAPE and NEIGHBORHOOD branding, while the iconic shell-toe is cast in pure white.\nIt’s interesting to note how the Boost sole has been largely concealed and is only visible due to the Superstar’s signature window.

Let us know your thoughts in the comments, and as ever, stay tuned for further information as we have it.\nIn related news, here’s a reminder of BAPE x NEIGHBORHOOD’s recent collection.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T12:49:33.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
