Leila de Lima, who is accused of having a hand in the country’s illegal drugs trade. \n“Workers defend civil liberties because political freedom is a necessity in fighting for and winning labor demands,” Bocacao added. \nThe group claimed that decades after the people power revolution in EDSA, dynasties and warlords continue to dominate the elections while the government “played deaf to the cry for social justice as globalization dictated by the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization was embraced.” \n“Cheap labor was used as come on for foreign investors. Farmers buckled under the onslaught of cheap imports. Social services suffered as the national budget was decimated by debt outlays, a big part of which was to pay loans taken out by Marcos. With a bleak future in the country, millions of Filipinos migrated despite all the sacrifices and difficulties,” Bocacao said.
