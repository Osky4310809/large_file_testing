There’s no way out,\" the reality star sobs.

Kim Kardashian (Photo: Splash News) \n\"When we’re out socially I just don’t know how to act. For so many years I’ve been used to playing a certain role and having to be responsible and watching out for his behaviour. \n\"He can be a little bit obnoxious and when I‘m in Miami trying to have fun with my friends I just don't want him to bring me down.\" \nHowever, later in the episode the pair appear to iron out their differences after sitting down for a heart to heart.

I feel like maybe there are times you want to run around with your girlfriends and don’t want your ex-boyfriend to be there. \n\"And if I’m hitting the strip I probably don’t want you rolling. So knock yourself out, kid,\" he quips. \n\"Oh yeah, buckle your seatbelt,\" the mum-of-three replies. \nTo camera, Kourtney adds: \"I'm happy Scott is bringing this up. Communicating is something we’re not good at at together. I think it’s going to be a constant process to figure out how to live life parenting out kids, being a family but not being together.\" \nKeeping Up With The Kardashians is available now in the UK & Ireland on hayu & 19th March at 9pm on E!
