IT’S BACK ON, BITCH! \n\n\n\nI’m speechless right now. Devastated and speechless. I’m not exactly shocked, but I am hurt. That’s not to say that I don’t understand the move, it makes perfect sense for both parties. Canadiens needed to change it up and Claude needed a job and they both wanted to hurt the Bruins, it was a match made in heaven. While the Bruce Cassidy era looks nice a whopping three games in, this still stings like a motherfucker. \n\nIt’s like breaking up with your girlfriend at the end of a long period of uncertainty, and you both knew it was the right move, and you both “wished each other well” even though you knew you didn’t mean it, then a week later she’s fucking your mortal enemy. It hurts. I always loved Claude and I wanted him to find another job, but I was thinking more in Vegas and less in the Atlantic Division with our hated rivals. Now we gotta see him all the time and hear about him all the time and with every success, which he will have, we’ll have to hear, “You let that guy go,” just like we still do with Seguin. I wanted it to be a clean break and he moved away to the western conference where I’d occasionally check his Facebook page and reminisce, I didn’t want him to start dating a hotter dude that frequented the same bars I do. Total and complete gut punch from Claude and the Canadiens here.
