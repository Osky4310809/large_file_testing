That results in a terrific, endlessly playable collection of urban pop-soul and new jack swing, but it also means that several of the collective's best-known songs are left off simply because they didn't top the R&B charts. Missing in action are Bobby Brown's \"Roni\" and \"Rock Wit'cha,\" Bell Biv DeVoe's \"Do Me!,\" Johnny Gill's \"Fairweather Friend,\" and Ralph Tresvant's \"Stone Cold Gentleman\" and \"Do What I Gotta Do,\" plus a bevy of New Edition hits. In fact, it might have been an even better idea to gather the biggest hits by the various New Edition spin-offs and leave the parent group's output alone; such an approach would have erased the contrast between the early New Edition bubblegum singles that lead off this collection and the grittier, funkier new jack hits that follow. Still, at least these omissions are due to the compilation's stated intent (collecting All the Number Ones and nothing else), rather than a record-company marketing tactic. Even casual fans will undoubtedly miss at least a couple of the aforementioned hits, but really, what is here makes for a great listen and a fine introduction to one of the most influential R&B family trees of the '80s and early '90s. Customer Reviews by marksterling I agree with the above. Great idea, but flawed. Some songs that may not have been number ones, but nevertheless were CLASSICS are missing. Songs like \"If it isnt love and \"Jealous girls\" from New Edition. BBD is not fully represented. \"When will i see your smile\" and \"Something in your eyes\"are missing. Overall a must-have compliation. Pretty Good but.. by my2mz1 many of the hits - if your a true New Edition fan - are missing. Candy Girl, Popcorn Love, Count Me Out, Crucial...too good to be missing. Great album - nice listening but missing some favorites of true NE fans. All The #1's In the R&B Charts by Phil Phenomenal Some people failed to recognize that this doesn't mean the # 1's on the pop charts, though half of the songs on the album deserves pop chart status as well. But this album is all the # 1's on the R&B charts. A classic selection of songs none the less. Biography Formed: 1982 in Boston, MA Genre: R&B/Soul Years Active: '80s, '90s, '00s, '10s New Edition's early, Jackson 5-inspired material made them the forerunners of two generations of teen pop (most of which was geared to white audiences). As they matured and progressed, they laid much of the groundwork for the fusion of hip-hop and R&B known as new jack swing. In fact, after New Edition drifted apart, all of its members had at least some significant success outside the group as part of the new jack movement, which helped ensure that their original incarnation would be remembered for...
