This is Puerto Rico’s second straight WBC in the finals, as they lost to the Dominican Republic last time around. This finals matchup would also mean that we’re guaranteed to see a first-time champion. \nOn the other hand, if Japan wins, the story would be the country’s dominance in this event. Japan won the inaugural event in 2006 and repeated as champ in 2009. So you’d have Puerto Rico shooting for its first title and Japan looking to have the bragging rights of winning three of the first four World Baseball Classics. Also, both teams would be undefeated heading into the bout. \nSo it comes down to this, with Tanner Roark (2.83 ERA in 210 IP last year) getting the ball for USA against a stacked Japanese lineup. For Japan, it’s Tomoyuki Sugano, who had a 2.01 ERA in 183 1/3 innings for the Yomiuri Giants (NPB, which is Japan’s major league) last season. \nWe’ll be live blogging all the action.
