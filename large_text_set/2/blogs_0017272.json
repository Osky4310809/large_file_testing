It is far beyond what either of us expected and we can't thank you all enough. We are so overcome and humbled by this experience. What happened here last night was no joke and we are all lucky to have climbed out of that water. Thank you to all the NYFD and NYPD who came out and were the real heroes saving the 8 kids we pulled out of the water. God is so good and for sure had our back last night. @ethanturnbull @mcdermottphotos \nA post shared by @bennett_jonas on Feb 21, 2017 at 8:20pm PST \n“The ice had actually broken … it actually cracked and fallen through and within those moments we just had to get down there and get them out,” Turnbull said of the kids.\nJonas described the scene as “chaotic,” noting that the children were frantically trying to climb out of the “brutal,” freezing water.\n“As I was entering the water, going in to it … they’re trying to get out as much as you’re trying to get them out,” Jonas said. “You’re their way out so they’re trying to get on top of you, get out any way they can.”\nSneak peak to the summer to come @calvinklein – Calvin Klein Swimwear #calvinklein #inmycalvins – @leandrojusten \nA post shared by E T H A N.

All were rescued and taken to nearby hospitals with minor hypothermia-related injuries, CBS2 reports.\nIn the wake of the incident, Jonas and Turnbull took to Instagram to detail the harrowing situation in their own words — and to post a few model-esque photos of themselves near the broken ice.\nTeenagers Rescued After Falling Through the Ice in Central Park \nIn one shot , Turnbull showed off his sparkling smile, and Jonas sported a serious expression as they posed alongside the pond.Jonas frequently lends his dashing looks to clothing company Southern Tide and Man of the World magazine.
