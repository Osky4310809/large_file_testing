It’s really just a blessing that I’ve been able to play the game – I’ve been playing the game since I was nine years old – so long without any major injury happening,” he said. \nThe disappointment goes beyond losing Orr as a football player, as general manager Ozzie Newsome and head coach John Harbaugh talk about his character. \n“I don’t think there has been any player more inspirational to me, than Zach,” said Newsome. \n“Coming in here and what he accomplished most definitely, but even beyond that, how he conducts himself every day, how hard he works. He’s highly intelligent, as hard a worker as you’re ever going to see, never, ever has a negative or disparaging word for anything or anybody,” said Harbaugh. \nOrr says he’s unsure of what lies ahead but he’d like to coach. \n“My brother said it best. He said, ‘instead of asking, “Why me?” ask, “What’s next?”‘ and that’s what I’m looking forward to and whatever that is, I’m ready to give it 110 percent,” said Orr. \nDespite not playing in the regular-season finale, Orr finished tied for eighth in the NFL with 132 tackles. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T17:50:39.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
