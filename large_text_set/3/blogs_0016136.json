At 19st, he was miserable and struggled to fit into his 44-inch jeans. \nThe Northern Irish lad was wearing a size XXXL and was stuck in a rut of no exercise, skipping breakfast and gorging on takeaways, crisps, chocolate and white bread. \n“As a teenager I was incredibly shy and introverted and had zero confidence around women,” Christopher said. \n“I would get called fat at school and I couldn’t even fit into high-street clothes. To make myself feel better I would comfort eat which only made my body worse.\" \nMUSCLEFOOD, INSTAGRAM/ONEMOREREP_PT SHREDDED: In just five years Christopher Feenan has gone from overweight to body builder LDN Muscle founder Tom Exton's workout pictures Tuesday, 13th December 2016 LDN Muscle founder Tom Exton shows off his shredded body 1 / 18 \n“I had no knowledge of what my diet should consist of. I would skip breakfast, have fast food for lunch and would have four to five takeaways a week,\" he added. \n“But when my friends suggested a lad’s holiday to Magaluf I knew something had to change.” \nThe now 23-year-old vowed to lose weight before the getaway and ended up shedding an incredible 8st . \nHowever, the personal trainer now eats substantially more than he once did in order to fuel his toned body – after reaching 11st, Christopher is now 15st of muscle. \nMUSCLEFOOD BEFORE AND AFTER: Christopher vowed to lose weight before a holiday to Magaluf \n“I managed to shed eight stone, which was great. But after regular trips to the gym I then decided to bulk up. \n“I adopted a stricter diet of high-protein meals and did more cardio and weight training. \n“After college I became a personal trainer, which has been a great way for me to show others that anyone can achieve the body they’ve always wanted.” \nHe has reduced his body fat percentage from 54% to 13%, however he eats 4,800 calories a day. \nThis is because Christopher has decided to enter his first bodybuilding competition and so he trains twice a day, six days a week. 58c292e93d7ca9a841f373bc \nChristopher buys his food from musclefood.com and maintains a diet of oats, egg-white omelettes, chicken, fish, peanut butter and rice cakes – all protein-packed food . \nAnother plus to Christopher’s weight loss? He met the girl of his dreams. \n“I am now engaged to my beautiful fiancé Charlotte. I don’t think I would have had the confidence to even say two words to her without having the physique I have now. It has certainly helped me get my dream girl. \n“My advice to anyone looking to lose weight is to not be afraid to get help. Seek advice or get a personal trainer, otherwise you’ll be left in the dark with no idea how to really lose the weight and build muscle. \n“By exercising regularly, eating well and generally taking good care of your body, you can get into the shape you’ve always wanted.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:32:53.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
