The Brazilian forward has had surgery in Spain to repair the broken metatarsal \nHe said: “We played Tottenham without Gabriel and we played really good against one of the best teams in the Premier League. We did very good things with Gabriel, but also without him. \n“We have seven strikers. We are going to use another one and, of course, Sergio will be so important for us.” \nJesus was operated on by Guardiola’s favourite surgeon Dr Ramon Cugat in Barcelona – and Guardiola says he does not know when the £27million striker will return. Jesus' injury is expected to see benched hero Aguero restored to the starting XI (Photo: PA) \nThe Spaniard said: “What’s important now is a good recovery. When he will be fit, I don’t know if it will be now or next season.” \nThe 19-year-old's injury means Aguero — benched for the last three games — is expected to start at Championship promotion-chasers Huddersfield in the FA Cup on Saturday, as City bid to extend their four-game winning run.
