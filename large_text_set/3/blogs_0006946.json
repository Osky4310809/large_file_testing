Advertisement \n“I feel like I’m in shape, but I’m not in my playing shape yet,” Young told the Houston Chronicle . The newspaper reported that Young, who hasn’t played a game in the NFL since 2011, signed a one-year contract with the Roughriders with a team option for a second season. \nAfter winning a national championship at Texas, going 3rd overall in the 2006 NFL draft, and making the Pro Bowl in 2006 and 2009, Young was cut by the Titans in 2011 following a fight with then-coach Jeff Fisher. His playing days were studded with stories of wild partying and strip club escapades , but he was a productive player who threw for 8,964 yards over parts of six seasons .

In 2014, he announced he was retired from football and would be taking a job in fundraising with his alma mater, where he’s been since. He was arrested last January for driving while intoxicated and eventually pleaded no contest, but he told the Chronicle that he’s matured since his NFL days. \n“I’ve got a family now, I’ve got kids,” Young said. “I wish I knew back then what I know now. I was a little immature about things, but things happen for a reason. You learn from your mistakes. I’m happy and I’m going to take full advantage of this opportunity.” \nClearly. \nThe Roughriders’ first game is Thursday, June 22 at 7:30 p.m. in Montreal.
