Protesters were calling for an end to Trump’s travel ban. \nClose to 200 people from the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland weaved through the streets of Baltimore City to come to the aid of refugees. Our media partner, Baltimore Sun, reports that 350 people were there to protest. \n“We are here for you, we love you, it makes no difference,” said Eugene Taylor Sutton, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland. \nIt’s been a similar scene across the country since Trump put a travel ban in place to block immigrants from seven predominately Muslim countries. \n“I’m sure that they are very afraid right now and feel very alone and isolated,” said Margo Landon from Baltimore.
