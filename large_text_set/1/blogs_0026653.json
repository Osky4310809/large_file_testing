ADVERTISEMENT \n“The annual report period cannot be extended, and failure to comply may result in the imposition of administrative fine or imprisonment,” said BI commissioner Jaime Morente. READ: Foreigners reminded to report to Immigration until March 3 \nOf the more than 50,000 foreigners who had themselves accounted for, almost half reported directly to the BI main office in Intramuros, Manila. \nThe others reported and paid their fees in the BI’s 49 field, satellite, extension offices all over the country, including the recently opened BI satellite office at the SM Aura in Taguig City. \nThe agency’s Annual Report 2017 began last January 3 and will last until March 3 this year, during which all registered aliens should report in person to the BI. \nUnder Republic Act 562 or the Alien Registration Act of 1950, registered aliens must report to the BI in person within the first 60 days of each year. \nFortunato Manahan, Jr., acting chief of the BI’s alien registration division, said the annual report fee for each alien is P300, with a legal research fee of P10. \nForeigners aged 14 and below will be represented by their parent or legal guardian, who will report to the BI on their behalf. \nAliens reporting to the BI are required to present their original and valid alien certificate of registration identity card (ACR I-Card) and original passport. \nThey should also present a confirmation number issued via the Annual Report 2017 online system. \nA registered alien may no longer report in person if he had personally appeared in at least one of the Annual Reports in the past three years. \nHis legal representative should present a special power of attorney and valid identification. \nAn alien who returns to the Philippines with a re-entry permit is required to report to the BI within 30 days of his return to the country if he has not made the required annual report. \nThe Annual Report 2017 application forms and guidelines, the list of participating BI field offices, the online encoding system and other information may be accessed at www.immigration.gov.ph .
