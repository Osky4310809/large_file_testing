There's been a lot of regret about the whole situation but we do not lack the regret that we stepped into the environment. Yes, we made the mistakes that we all well know but if I could change one thing, I'd say, 'Boys, here's our bottle of water, here's a bag of bread, lets go.' I'm me, and I'm biased, but I don't think the results change, so yeah, I certainly would love ... I'm not trying to opine on the current state of cycling, because I don't know it. But of course, on a truly level playing field, I'd love to toe that line.\" \nDylan Casey, who quit professional cycling after a short career to work for Google and then Yahoo in Silicon Valley, said his professional career taught him how to persevere. \n\"Sometimes I try to answer the question. Sometimes I think it's impossible to answer it just because of what I know now,\" he said. \n\"My story is so different because I got into cycling so late. And three years later, when I decided to do it later, I found myself on the start line of the Tour of Flanders. I didn't even know what that race was. I just had no idea what I was getting into. Regardless of the mistakes I made, that I learned to persevere through just about anything. That's the thing that has stick with me. So it's difficult to say what I would or wouldn't do. But coming away with that ability has been priceless.\" \nHincapie rarely revealed his true feeling while racing and even since serving his brief ban for doping. However, during the podcast he was arguably more insightful and honest. \n\"I definitely agree that it was tough being thrown into that generation of cycling,\" he said. \n\"Fortunately and unfortunately for many reasons, I was a professional cyclist for 20 years, so I can arguably say I was in a couple of different generations. But I will say with 100 per cent certainty, that I was very lucky to be part of and ridden with the best cyclists in the history of the sport in those 20 years. I mean Lance, Contador, Cadel Evans, Mark Cavendish. I saw it all. \n\"We talk about what happened 20 years ago, Yes, cycling was really f*cked up then. But I truly believe we saw a lot of changes, and I truly believe I was able to ride the best of the best. I do believe the sport has changed a lot since what happened 20 years ago and is definitely in a better place than it was 20 years ago. I know I made mistakes but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I know I was part of a f*cked-up generation, but at the same time, I met my wife at the 2003 Tour de France.\" \nVande Velde now works in television as a technical commentator for NBC in the US, and he seemed keen to put it all behind him. He now lives in South Carolina, close to Hincapie. \n\"I agree with what people have said,\" he said. \n\"I was part of Project 96 and that's how I got a pro contract with US Postal. I like looking back even to silly things like pictures of us not wearing helmets as we rode down the Galibier at 500km/h, to also all the shit that did go down. But also as George eluded to: righting the wrongs a little bit, all the way through to 2013 and leaving (the sport) in a better place than where it was.\" \nArmstrong ended the debate about if the four would do it all over again with a wider reflection of why it happened and why the sport changed. He also admitted that deciding to make a comeback \"opened up the whole pandora's box.\" \n\"I could look at the situation and ask, 'What was the tipping point? What effected the change?'\" he said. \"Was it Floyd Landis testing positive in '06? People were like 'Wow, shit just got real.' Losing his Tour title. Or the whereabouts program got more and more advanced and more and more funding and therefore the out-of-competition testing was better, the biological passport evolved. It got harder and harder to rig the system, and so those two came together and that effected change,\" Armstrong said. \nHe argued that the doping debate can never be black or white and insisted he and others would not have been successful without the hard training and rigorous lifestyle. He hints that he stills feels he was singled out for punishment. \n\"For 10 years the narrative was: We have the best technology, we train the hardest, we do the most reconnaissance, we're the most organised, we have the smartest tactics, we have the best director, we watch our diet, all those things. Everything was on the table,\" he explained. \n\"It's not even a frustrating thing for me, it's a painful thing for me, that when my story goes down in 2012, and USADA makes the move that it makes, the entire world shifts and says: This asshole, he told us it was the training and the diet, and the team and the reconnaissance. The whole world shifted and said, 'It was none of that. It was the doping.' So if I had magic wand and change just on thing, yes, they all happened but that tenth thing, doesn't happen if the first nine don't. \n\"We all did the work, so I felt there was a shift from a white-hat story to a black-hat story and neither were true. It's a grey-hat story. The one thing I'd hate to think is that we forget all the hard work that we all did.\" Share on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:31:03.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
