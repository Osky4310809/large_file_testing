The top-seeded Villanova Wildcats defeated No. 6 Creighton 74 to 60 in Madison Square Garden on Saturday night. With the victory, the Wildcats avenged last season’s Big East title game loss to Seton Hall. \nVillanova was in control throughout Saturday’s game, getting to halftime holding a 36-22 lead. That held in the second half, as the Wildcats’ offense scored 38 points, and the defense was able to hold Creighton to the same amount.\nNova’s scoring effort was led by senior guard Josh Hart, who had 20 points on the night, and added six rebounds.\nThe next question for Villanova now will come Sunday, with the field of 68 teams and their seeding to be revealed. The Wildcats look primed to earn the No. 1 overall seed, finishing with a 31-3 season record. Villanova will look to be one of four other teams to win the conference’s regular, conference, and tournament title, and go on to win the national title. Since the field expanded in 1985, Florida was the last to do it in 2007, then UConn in 1999, and Kentucky in 1998. Duke won it all in 1992 and Louisville in 1986.\nWe’ll see how Selection Sunday shakes out for the Wildcats, but all signs are certainly pointing towards them ending up with the No. 1 overall seed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T02:51:54.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
