George Michael's death on Christmas Day capped a year filled with celebrity passings (Photo: PA) Where and when? \nThe Hertfordshire-born performer, real name Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou, died at his home over the 2016 Christmas period at the age of 53. \nHe was discovered by long-term boyfriend Fadi Fawaz, who had slept in his car the night before the tragedy and, upon discovering the body, called emergency services and - later - his cousin, Josh, in Australia. \nThe latter conversation - which heard him say \"Oh God, I think he's dead\" - took place as paramedics fought, unsuccessfully, to save the chart-topper. Fadi later helped police with their investigation by being interviewed for more than five hours. \nA post-mortem was conducted in early January, but was deemed inconclusive.

No. A flood of visitors descended on the pop star’s home, proving the star was NOT a loner. \nExclusive pictures published by The Mirror showed at least ten people arriving at the large detached house in the lead-up to Christmas Day, when the singer was found dead. \nHis godson Roman Kemp – son of Spandau Ballet star Martin and his wife Shirlie, who was George’s backing vocalist in Wham! – told how the singer planned a Boxing Day meal before his death.
