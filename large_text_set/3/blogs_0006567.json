Advertisement Advertisement \n“He was truly difficult to train,” trainer Justin Snaith told the newspaper. “All he wanted to do was jump all the fillies.” \nHe also said: “President Trump was also very vocal and would just not focus on his work. I considered blinkers and a tongue-tie but he was so unmanageable that we had little option but to geld him.” \nPresident Trump is the son of Philanthropist and was bought for $13,740 last year, according to auction records . He is being trained by Snaith Racing, a champion South African brother duo—Justin and Jonathan Snaith—whose website says that they “base their successful formula on ‘a happy horse is a valuable horse.’” Evidently, male horses can still be happy after a veterinarian shears off their nether region, because the Racing Post reported that the drastic strategy worked: Sponsored \nGelding President Trump seems to have had the desired effect as Snaith reported that, although still “arrogant,” the son of American-bred Philanthropist had settled down and was “doing great.” \nSo, President Trump won’t be siring any colts or fillies of his own, but—if he’s a really good boy and heeds his trainers and focuses on his work—maybe, just maybe he’ll find himself in a winner’s circle some day.
