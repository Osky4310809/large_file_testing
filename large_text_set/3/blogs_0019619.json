In the early hours of June 30, 2009, as the family members were returning from a vacation in Niagara Falls, they stopped at Kingston Mills, where the women were killed, possibly predrowned there, and their bodies put back in the car and dumped into the Rideau Canal near Kingston Mills.\nCrowe testified that he was retained to represent Yahya, but from the outset of the case it was made clear to him that Shafia would be paying the defence costs.\nCrowe said he initially charged $450 an hour for Yahya’s defence.\nIn October 2010, Shafia asked for Crowe to lower his fee, and a new rate of $365 was negotiated, Crowe said.\nMICHAEL LEATHE / Postmedia Network file Mohammad Shafia, front left, his wife Tooba Mahommad Yahya, front right, and their son Hamed Shafia, back, arrive in Frontenac County Court in Kingston, Ont. on Oct. 20, 2011. In December 2011, as his fees for services began to outpace the money the family was putting forward and the outstanding amounts started to add up, Crowe said he offered to again lower his rate to $350 if Shafia paid the overdue amounts promptly, he said.\nIn March 2012, after the trial had wrapped up, Crowe offered to reduce the outstanding amount to just less than $67,000 in an effort to compel Shafia to pay his bill. There was no response to that offer, Crowe said.\nCrowe said he discussed his fee with Shafia during meetings in a room in the basement of the Frontenac County Court House. The meetings included all three family members on trial, their attorneys and an interpreter, he said.\nWhile Yahya was present, Crowe said she did not participate in the discussions about Crowe’s fees.\nFile Rona Shafia, left and Sahar Shafia, in a photo recovered from Sahar's cellphone, taken June 26, 2009. “There were never any complaints about my fees until I commenced my statement of claim,” Crowe said while being questioned by his attorney, Michael Woogh.\nIn his cross-examination Shafia’s lawyer, Eric Lavictoire from Cornwall, pointed out that Crowe’s records show he only met with Shafia once. Crowe replied that his court docket is often not detailed enough to show the individuals with whom he has met.\nLavictoire also asked why Crowe had not gotten a written contract with Shafia to defend Yahya.\n“You didn’t feel it was important to get anything in writing from Mr. Shafia,” Lavictoire asked.\n“His actions supported the oral contract that I believed we had, that we did have,” Crowe replied.\nThe court was told Monday that Yahya was self-represented but would not be attending the proceedings because Correctional Service Canada would not pay the costs of transporting her to Kingston and she could not afford the costs herself.\n“It is a significant cost,” Lavictoire said.\nLavictoire said she had been informed about the consequences of not attending the proceedings. Justice Hugh McLean made a default judgment against her.\nThe civil trial is to continue this week with other lawyers involved in the criminal trial expected to appear. Shafia is also scheduled to appear later this week.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:07:42.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
