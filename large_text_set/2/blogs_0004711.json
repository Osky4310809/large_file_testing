Robert, who is costarring in the upcoming Lost City of Z film alongside Charlie Hunnam , kept things casual in a beanie and Nike sneakers, while Twigs looked like her usual effortlessly cool self. \nRob and Twigs have been dating since August 2014, but his relationship with ex-girlfriend Kristen Stewart still managed to make headlines over the weekend. Kristen hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time ever this week, and during her opening monologue, the Personal Shopper actress took a walk down memory lane and brought up the tweets Donald Trump sent out about her and Robert in 2012. The tweets in question encouraged Rob to leave her after she was caught cheating on him with her married Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders. Rob has yet to comment on the situation, but perhaps he's just too busy planning his wedding to Twigs.
