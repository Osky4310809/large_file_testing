For Captain America: Civil War , this meant introducing and battling over the Sokovia Accords, a document any super powered person working privately or with a government organization must sign in order to keep operating within legal boundaries. On the movie side, this has led to the Avengers being dwindled in size to now only include Iron Man, War Machine, and Vision (after fellow signees Black Panther left and Black Widow betrayed the team).\nOn television, the Netflix heroes have been able to stay in the shadows to avoid having to sign for now, but powered individuals on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. have not had that same privilege. Instead, the show has previously shown Yo-Yo signing the Accords after being an official S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, and now it looks as though a now-officially reinstated Daisy Johnson will do so next.\nTelevision Promos has released the first clip from the 11th episode of season 4, titled “Wake Up,” featured above. The clip shows Coulson, Jeffrey Mace, Simmons, Daisy, LMD May, and Glenn Talbot gathered to discuss Daisy’s decision to sign the Sokovia Accords. Daisy and Coulson plan to use this as a decoy to plant spy gear in Senator Nadeer’s office, but based on the promo and photos from the episode , things probably won’t go according to plan.\nAs pointed out in the clip by Simmons, Daisy following through with this decision would be quite surprising. Not only is it a big change for her as a character after spending much of this season trying to stay out of the public eye, but also could have big ramifications for her future.\nDaisy signing the Accords puts her on a different level than before as she would then be recognized not just nationally, but globally, as an enhanced individual. She would also mark the second Inhuman to our knowledge to sign the papers, which only further raises questions as to why some of the Accords biggest supporters, Thunderbolt Ross and Tony Stark, do not know about or utilize her abilities. Daisy has not fully crafted her Quake abilities, but under the right leadership could be one of the more powerful people on the planet.\nThe truth of the matter is, no matter how hard S.H.I.E.L.D. pushes Daisy into the light, such as possibly making her the newest director of S.H.I.E.L.D., her potential appearance or even acknowledgement in the larger universe doesn’t have the best chance of happening. Hopefully this thought process will be proven wrong in the years to come, but S.H.I.E.L.D. having two recurring cast members listed on the Accords is just the latest attempt to connect everything and also make it that much more difficult for them to be ignored.\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. continues next Tuesday with ‘Wake Up’ @10pm on ABC.\nSource: Television Promos", "external_links": ["http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Agents-of-SHIELD-Quake-promo-image.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Agents-of-SHIELD-Quake-promo-image.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Agents-of-SHIELD-Quake-promo-image.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Agents-of-SHIELD-Quake-promo-image.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Agents-of-SHIELD-Quake-promo-image.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Agents-of-SHIELD-Quake-promo-image.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Agents-of-SHIELD-Quake-promo-image.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O79bLROnpPo", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Agents-of-SHIELD-Quake-promo-image.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1417&h=708&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-21T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T04:57:15.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
