But if it comes to it, prefer the deep state to the Trump state.\" For those who are not aware of the term \"deep state,\" it refers to the secret services in a dictatorship who overthrow governments, manipulate the press, and otherwise eliminate opponents. I first heard the term in reference to Turkey , whose military and intelligence services overthrew governments they didn't like with depressing regulatory during the postwar period. To speak of a \"deep state\" in an American context is to say that the United States is turning into a banana republic.\nThis is no joking matter. I am confident that President Trump and the tough guys in his cabinet will root out the saboteurs, leakers, manipulators and liars who infest the intelligence services and who conspire with the liberal media to invent fake-news charges against a duly elected administration. But the danger is real, and the fact that the intelligence community is playing games with domestic politics is a danger to our liberties.\nLast May 15, the perspicacious David Horowitz denounced Kristol in Breitbart as a \"renegade Jew.\" Of course, the headline was employed later to show that Breitbart was anti-Semitic--even though Horowitz was arguing that Kristol had betrayed critical Jewish interests. I responded with a note in this space to the effect that Kristol wasn't a \"renegade Jew,\" just a sore loser throwing tantrum. It was \"churlish,\" I said, to attack a man's religion in that way.\nHorowitz was right and I was wrong, and I herewith offer him my apology.\nKristol is a renegade Jew, and an apologist for anti-Constitutional, illegal manipulation by America's self-designated \"deep state.\" His hatred for Donald Trump has unhinged him. Decent people should cross the street to avoid walking too close to him.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/spengler/2017/02/16/an-apology-to-david-horowitz-he-was-right-about-bill-kristol/", "external_links": ["http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/12/the-deep-state", "https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/831497364661747712", "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/05/15/bill-kristol-republican-spoiler-renegade-jew/"], "published": "2017-02-16T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:09:36.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
