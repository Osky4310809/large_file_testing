Apple&apos;s vast app ecosystem made this decision easy. Here are the best iOS, Android and Kindle tablets ranked for February.\n\nThe best tablets in 2017 are all about combination. They all offer thin-and-light designs, but have decent keyboard and desktop-style experiences.\nA good tablets makes you ask the question: Why do I even need a laptop? Here&apos;s the problem. There are a lot of choices out there, from Apple&apos;s larger iPad Pro to Android&apos;s Google Nexus and Samsung tablets. \nAnd it&apos;s more than just iOS 10 and Android Nougat devices, unlike the best smartphones - Kindle and Windows tablets actually make an appearance, too.\nWe rank tablets based on multiple factors, including performance, battery life, screen quality and more, with price playing an important part in the final tally.\nRead: Best cheap tablets | Best Android tablets If none of the best tablets here take your fancy then head on over to our tablet reviews pages, where you'll find in-depth reviews for many more models.\nLet us know your thoughts on the top 10 (and what order you think they should go in) in the comment box below.\n\nThe best tablet you can buy right now is the iPad Pro 9.7 - the smaller screen with powerful innards is the best combination on the market.\nWhile there are plenty of brilliant Android tablets around at the moment, the newest iPad offers a lot of the power of the larger iPad Pro, along with the Smart Keyboard and Pencil support, but brings it in a much more bag-and-palm friendly size. Oh, and those four speakers are just brilliant too!\nThere&apos;s no Apple iPad Pro 2 release date just yet, or even confirmation that such a tablet exists. You&apos;re safe to buy this one right now.\nRead the full review: iPad Pro 9.7 \nGoogle&apos;s Pixel C is simply the best Android tablet. It has a fantastic display, heaps of power and a premium design. It pairs well with a Google Pixel or Google Pixel XL smartphone and even runs the Android 7.0 Nougat update.\nIt&apos;s not quite a laptop replacement, but there&apos;s a fantastic keyboard accessory if you&apos;re willing to pay extra. Be warned: You won&apos;t find the cheaper Google Pixel C 32GB model on sale through the Google Store. Only the 64GB is sold there now, though you can still find the 32GB deals through other retailers.\nRead the full review: Google Pixel C \n\nThere are plenty of reasons to invest in the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 - especially if you&apos;re looking to buy one of the best Android tablets. This is the best tablet that Samsung has ever produced - it&apos;s both reading and web surfing-friendly, has a sensational Super AMOLED screen.\nYou can pick it up for a new low price in 8-inch and 9.7-inch variants. Almost impossibly thin, pumped full of power and with a slicker interface it gives the best iPads a real run for its literal money. \nWe&apos;ve heard whispers of a Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 release date, but we don&apos;t expect to be able to buy that one until after MWC 2017 this month and we suspect it&apos;ll launch at a obviously higher price, whereas this tablet has been discounted over the last several months.\nRead the full review: Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 \n\nThe best 7-inch tablet at the moment is definitely the iPad mini 4. If you like the look of Apple&apos;s iPad Air 2 and iPad Pro, but find them too big, too expensive or both, then you&apos;re in luck. With no official confirmation of an iPad mini 5 yet, the diminutive iPad mini 4 gives you the best of Apple&apos;s tablet world in a form factor that&apos;s not only beautiful, but highly portable.\nRead the full review: iPad mini 4 \nThe Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet is the best tablet option for PS4 and PS4 Pro owners, as it allows you to stream games from your console direct to the tablet when you&apos;re in another room of your house. Link up your PlayStation 4 controller to the Z4 Tablet and you&apos;ll be gaming in bed, in the kitchen and on the toilet. The included keyboard dock in the box also makes for a great stand. \nIf you can get used to Sony&apos;s version of the Android user interface and handle the price tag, this isn&apos;t a bad option. There&apos;s no Sony Xperia Z5 and it may be skipped entirely for a Sony Xperia Z6 , but this is not a reason to hold off on buying right now, as it&apos;s merely a rumor.\nRead the full review: Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet \nThe iPad Pro won&apos;t be for everyone due to the size and cost, but for those it does appeal to (and can afford it), you&apos;re unlikely to find a better tablet for your needs. Whether its graphics, multi-tasking or providing a pseudo-Mac experience when you&apos;re away from the office the iPad Pro is capable of so much. \nEven the Apple Pencil - hilarious name aside - is an impressive tool for a particular niche. Not everyone will dig it. But for serious pros who need more than the iPad Pro 9.7, this is the best tablet to replace a laptop.\nRead the full review: iPad Pro \n\nOriginally a rather expensive Google-branded tablet, the Nexus 9 has now dropped so much in price it&apos;s the best value tablet out there. There&apos;s a whole load of power, stock Android and a high-resolution screen making it a great all-round tablet at a very affordable price.Best of all,  it runs the latest version of Android: Android 7 Nougat.\nYou won&apos;t find the Nexus 9 available to buy through Google&apos;s official website anymore. All Nexus-branded devices have been banished since the company ushered in the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL. But you can still find it for a cheap price on Amazon and at other retailers.\nRead the full review: Nexus 9 \n\nTablets don&apos;t have to be big and cumbersome, and the rather clumsily named Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact is testament to just that. It&apos;s not Sony&apos;s best tablet - that goes to the Z4 further up the page, but it&apos;s super-slim profile, waterproof chassis, bright display and solid line up of specs means it&apos;ll comfortably slip in your bag and won&apos;t baulk at the first sign of rain. However, it&apos;s a little older now, so be warned that it won&apos;t be getting all the Android updates you might hope for.\nRead the full review: Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact \n\nCan a tablet really replace your laptop or home PC? That&apos;s still up for debate, but the best tablet trying to make that happen right now is the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 - and it does a fine job with the full blown version of Windows 10 .\nIt has an integrated kickstand and optional keyboard attachment, making it ideal for creative professionals, students and everyday folks alike.\nRead the full review: Microsoft Surface Pro 4 \nUntil the iPad Pro 9.7, this was the best tablet in the world. Even though it has been replaced by Apple, it&apos;s still a brilliant tablet that has further raised the bar for the rest of the competition in terms of build quality, features and performance.\nGood news: it&apos;s now cheaper thanks to the release of the newer iPad Pro. Apple&apos;s range of tablet-optimized apps and a slick iOS 10 user interface makes the iPad Air 2 extremely versatile while also being incredibly easy, and enjoyable, to use.\nRead the full review: iPad Air 2 \nTablet apps As with today&apos;s best smartphones , applications play a big role on tablets â€“ once you&apos;ve decided which of these tablets is right for you, check out our top app lists so you can get your fill of Temple Run , update your friends on Facebook and read the latest news, all on a bigger screen.\nBest Android apps Best iPad apps Best free iPad apps Best free Android games Best iPad games Best free iPad games Also consider If you&apos;re not quite ready to part with your cash, then take a look at these other noteworthy slates â€“ they&apos;re one that almost made our top 10 best tablets list or are coming out soon.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro S was unveiled at the very start of 2016 and boasts a great screen, solid build and Windows 10. It&apos;s an odd device, but one that works better than we expected it to. The keyboard dock isn&apos;t great, with a cramped mouse and keys which aren&apos;t the easiest to type on - but over all Samsung&apos;s made a solid Windows slate.\nRead our review: Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro S \n\nHuawei&apos;s first Windows 10 device is a well-designed 2-in-1 that rivals the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and iPad Pro in places. It&apos;s a promising, yet pricey, first 2-in-1 from the Chinese company, managing to feel fresh despite arriving late to the party.\nRead our review: Huawei MateBook \n\nWe haven&apos;t seen a new Xperia tablet in over a year, but this one could make an appearance at MWC 2017 after being a no-show at least year&apos;s event. We fully expect it to feature a waterproof design, bumped up specs and a higher-than-average price tag. This is a Sony product after all. But we could use a high-end Android tablet to rival everything that Apple is doing.\nTips for Sony: what we want to see on the Sony Xperia Z6 Tablet \n\nThe popular iPad mini range has won fans around the world, probably due to the fact it&apos;s the cheapest iPad offering in Apple&apos;s range. While the arrival of the iPad mini 5 in 2017 is likely, there&apos;s a small question mark around whether Apple will bother after criticism for its less than impressive iPad mini 3 update. If it does arrive expect more power with a new processor, the latest version of iOS 10 on screen and the same premium metal body.\nWhat it needs to beat: iPad mini 4 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:47:34.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
