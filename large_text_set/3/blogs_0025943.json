Media caption Drone footage of the Papatea fault crossing State Highway 1 \nAt issue was the way the quake was able to rupture so far along its path, to produce such a big magnitude. \nStarting in South Island's North Canterbury region, the crustal failure moved eastwards and northwards along the coast to Marlborough Province, before then petering out offshore. In the process, the quake managed to straddle two major fault networks. \nThe behaviour challenged some long-accepted ideas. One of these is the notion that ruptures cannot jump large separations between individual fault segments. \nFive km is considered something of a limit. But in the Kaikoura event, substantially larger step-overs were recorded. \nHow this was possible is not fully explained, says Prof Tim Wright from Leeds University, UK . \n\"We think the main reason was some very large stress changes introduced early in the earthquake that then triggered the later segments to fail,\" he told the Science In Action programme on the BBC World Service. \n\"There were also in this case some faults we didn't know about, even though New Zealand has one of the best fault maps in the world; and so some of these big jumps were facilitated by motion on faults we didn't know were there. But in many cases, there are genuine gaps of 15-20km.\" Media caption Prof Tim Wright: \"The Kaikoura quake broke the rules\" \nThe team believes the exceptional nature of the Kaikoura event raises questions about how the risk of future quakes is assessed. Some of the assumptions that go into building seismic models now need to be revisited, the group argues. \nIn terms of magnitude, only December's M7.9 event in Papua New Guinea was bigger in 2016. Given the level of shaking produced in the New Zeland quake, it is remarkable there were so few deaths (\"just\" two) and injuries. Hundreds of people in the town of Kaikoura itself did though have to be evacuated because landslides had cut local roads. \nAlso astonishing was the scale of \"surface expression\". Giant fissures opened in the ground, highways were broken by metres-long offsets, beaches rose up from the sea, and railway lines were lifted high into the air.

They will trace the amount of ground movement. In the Kaikoura event, parts of northern South Island moved by about 6m horizontally with an uplift of about 8m \nTo understand the complexity of the Kaikoura quake, the scientists used a range of techniques, including mapping with satellite interferometry. \nThis works by finding the difference in \"before\" and \"after\" radar images of the Earth taken from orbit. It allows even quite subtle ground movements to be detected, including in those areas where the surface itself has not been ripped apart. \nThe team was able to call on two different systems - the Sentinel-1 spacecraft operated by Europe, and the Alos platform owned by the Japanese. \n\"Alos's longer radar wavelengths allow us to see through the vegetation; we can see the tree trunks rather than the leaves and they're much more stable for making deformation maps,\" explained Prof Wright. \n\"However, with Sentinel's shorter wavelengths you get much more detail, which allows us to narrow down exactly where the deformation has occurred.\" Media caption Three cows left stranded by the quake became an internet sensation \nand follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T07:55:15.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
