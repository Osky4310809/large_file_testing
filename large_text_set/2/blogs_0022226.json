Conway denied the report, saying that she took a break to tend to family responsibilities. \n“I don't think I have to explain myself if I'm not going on TV if I'm out with four kids for three days looking at houses and schools,” she told Fox News’ Sean Hannity.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:25:44.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
