We live in a world that offers choice for everything from styles of coffee to TV shows to TVs themselves. But when it comes to brainstorming, we pretty much have one option: get everyone in a room and start throwing ideas out there. \nThis generally works well for extroverts (though some say otherwise ) and not so great for everyone else. \nIt doesn't have to be this way. In fact, there's a way to brainstorm without aggravating or alienating the introverts on your team, and it isn't as difficult as you might think. One Brainstorm, Different Brains \nProfessor Dario Nardi of UCLA has been conducting cutting-edge research on brain connectivity for years. As he recently explained it to us, \"Generally, introverts spend more time processing data, have more activity and linkages in the back half of the brain, and are easily over-stimulated. Oppositely,\" Nardi adds, \"extroverts spend less time processing data, have more activity and linkages in the front half of the brain, and are easily under -stimulated.\" Not everyone has to be there all the time while the brainstorm is taking place. \nSo while there's some debate as to whether the introvert-extrovert divide is an oversimplification, brain science nonetheless points to a spectrum anchored on either end by thinking patterns that are virtual mirror images of one another. \nThis means many extroverts enjoy traditional shout-it-out, put-it-up-on-the-board brainstorming. They like the stimulation; they like the speed of data processing. But introverts get overwhelmed by all the noise. Because introverts process data more slowly, they tend to get exhausted trying to keep up with all the ideas flying around, one after another. There’s no time to process them all. \nNot only does the traditional brainstorm disadvantage introverts, it shortchanges your whole team—which is missing out on many of the ideas, or synthesis of ideas, that introverts can offer the whole group. The New Rules Of Brainstorming \nFortunately, all it takes is putting in place some new rules that takes brainstorming from a free-for-all only extroverts can love to a truly collaborative process. \n1. Let folks come and go. Not everyone has to be there all the time while the brainstorm is taking place. Different people have different tolerance levels for the process. Don’t force introverts to stay longer than they can be of use. \n2. Invite introverts to show up later . . . Don't force them all to arrive right in the beginning. Many extroverts talk out loud to figure out what they actually think. That can be really productive for them but exhausting and frustrating for introverts. Introverts often have to keep waiting for an extrovert to get to the point, and meanwhile they can’t think about their own ideas. \n3. . . . even halfway through. It doesn't hurt to let introverts show up in the middle of the session, after up to half of the time you've allotted has already gone by. That may sound like a lot, but as long as they're using the same period to mull over their own ideas independently, it's not a waste. Just make sure the introverts know it isn't a free pass to opt out of the process. Instead, they'll show up later on with their own thoughts better formed. And when they do, have someone give them a recap—which will in turn help the extroverts get their own ideas in order and refocus the session. \n4. Impose a moment of silence . . . After the recap, declare a three-minute period of silent reflection for everybody to write down their thoughts. This will give the introverts a chance to process what they’ve heard. Then, when the brainstorm is opened up again, the newly joined introverts share their ideas first . \n5. . . . then open the door again. The introverts don’t have to stay. They can leave at this point if they want.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:19:24.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
