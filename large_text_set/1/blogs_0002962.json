The kidnapped man can be seen tied up and gagged in the corner of a room while he is humiliated. During the video the man’s clothes are cut, he is peppered with cigarette ash, kicked, punched, and has his scalp cut bad enough where blood runs down his head. At one point, the captors push the victim’s head into a toilet and force him to drink the toilet water. \nThe kidnapping and torture could possibly be considered a hate crime since the victim is repeatedly forced to denounce white people as well as Donald Trump. Alos the captors make derogatory comments and use inflammatory language . \nChicago police confirm that four people, two males and two females, are currently in custody, but charges have yet to be filed. \nMeanwhile, the young man was treated at a hospital for his injuries and is now with his parents. Officers found the victim wandering the neighborhood in an obvious state of trauma.\n“It’s sickening,” Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said at a news conference. “It’s makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that. I’ve been a cop for 28 years, and I’ve seen things that you shouldn’t see in a lifetime, but it still amazes me how you still see things that you just shouldn’t.\n“He is an acquaintance of one of these subjects,” Chicago Police Cmdr. Kevin Duffin said of the victim. “Apparently, they met out in the suburbs. These subjects then stole a van out in the suburbs and then brought him into Chicago.”\n[ CBSChicago ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:38:13.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
