It allows drivers to make free left turns, meaning vehicles won’t cross opposing traffic between the two main traffic signals. POST-DISPATCH \nTopping the list compiled by a law firm of the 200 “most dangerous” intersections in the state is the diverging diamond interchange on Dorsett Road at Interstate 270 in Maryland Heights. \nIt was the first of its kind in the St. Louis region, and opened in 2010. Motorists driving through these interchanges shift to the left side of the road just before cars pull into the highway onramp so drivers don’t cross opposing traffic while making that left. \nThe law firm of Douglas Haun Heidemann, in the Missouri towns of Springfield and Bolivar, worked with the data agency 1point1 Interactive to crunch data from 148,000 crash reports from 2010 to 2015 and found that 149 accidents had occurred at that intersection, resulting in 48 injuries but no deaths. \nWhile the term “most dangerous” strikes an image of blood-drenched streets, the study examined total accidents, injuries and fatalities and assigned a “collision danger index” to rank the intersections. \nThe Hazelwood intersection of McDonnell Boulevard at Interstate 270 scored the No. 3 spot on the list, with 42 injuries and 80 crashes, which averages to 16 crashes a year. \nSo why go to the trouble of compiling such a list? \nAttorney Nathan Duncan, a litigation partner for Douglas Haun Heidemann, said the data could be used in litigation, although because his firm developed the study, it may present a challenge from the opposing attorney. \nThe data could be useful, he said, if the case involves an intersection on the top 200 list. \nHe also said his firm hasn’t developed any recommendations for changes at intersections named in the study, which used records of crash reports submitted to the Missouri Department of Transportation from the state highway patrol. \n“It’s just a compilation really of the information contained in those records,” Duncan said. \nJeanne Olubogun, a MoDOT district traffic engineer, said one of the reasons a diverging-diamond design was chosen for the intersection of Dorsett Road and Interstate 270 was to help handle more traffic spurred by the nearby Edward Jones development. \nAnd it has helped with congestion at safety at Dorsett and Interstate 270, she said. That traffic design reduces what engineers call “conflict points,” but can be confusing to people unfamiliar with the pattern, Olubogun said. \nShe also noted the study didn’t take into account the volume of vehicles that go through an area in its findings. \nSome other interesting findings from the study, which you can see at www.dhhlawfirm.com and search by city: \n• Gimblin Road and Hall Street in St. Louis had the fewest accidents of any intersection, yet it tied with three others for the most fatalities — that’s because of a crash on Oct. 22, 2015 , in which a driver and his female passenger were killed when their car ran a red light and collided with another vehicle. \n• Country Club Hills in north St. Louis County, which is near Jennings and has a population of 1,272, is the smallest city to make the list. West Florissant Avenue and Highway U was ranked as the 56th most dangerous intersection in the state. \n• St. Louis and Kansas City each had 45 intersections on the list, which is of course no surprise given their size and amount of traffic in comparison to other Missouri cities. Kansas City had four of the top 10 most dangerous intersections, and St. Louis had just one — Jefferson Avenue at Interstate 44, which logged 74 accidents and 39 injuries. \n• Among the top 200 “most dangerous” intersections, the difference between those ranking high and those toward the bottom was stark. The top 25 most dangerous averaged more than twice as many collisions, and nearly three times as many injuries, as the bottom 25 on the list. \nThis 2009 Post-Dispatch file graphic shows the double-diamond interchange in Maryland Heights, which was first of its kind in the St. Louis area.
