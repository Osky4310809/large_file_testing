HipHopDX’s Justin Hunte even gave a few brainy reasons why Nicki Minaj shouldn’t even respond to Remy while our editor-in-chief Trent Clark expounded on how Rem missed her chance by using the instrumental to Nas’“Ether” to prove her point. Why Nicki Minaj Should Not Respond To Remy Ma \nThe general consensus on Twitter is that “No Frauds” is not a proper diss number, but it certainly is a bop. \nWhile some seem disappointed that Nick didn’t bite back as hard as Remy did, others are okay with the possibility that “No Frauds” will be 2017’s summer anthem. Much like Drizzy accomplished with the Meek Mill diss track “Back To Back.” \"Back 2 Back?! Me and Drizzy laughed at that..\" \n— Yac House P (@PhillyTheBoss) March 10, 2017 \nCue the Instagram captions. But what does PARTYNEXTDOOR have to do with any of this? big night for partynextdoor's publishing \n— paul thompson (@paulxt) March 10, 2017 When the PartyNextDoor reference track for \"No Frauds\" leaks the Barbs and the Owls are going to be upset. \n— Rap Game WOJ (@CAWBBBB) March 10, 2017 The disappointment permeates. \n— Wave Letterman (@SpotGetsCake) March 10, 2017 \"No Frauds\" is not a diss track \"No Frauds\" is not a diss track \"No Frauds\" is not a diss track \"No Frauds\" is not a diss track \n— R e c h a r g e d (@Its__travis) March 10, 2017 This #NoFrauds diss is like when you get roasted and you can't think of a comeback until 3 weeks later in the middle of the night \n— Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) March 10, 2017 Nicki Minaj definitely acted like Shether aint happen.. focused on how wack 'another one' was… Told yall.. Remy f*cked up w/ that song \n— DJ Akademiks (@IamAkademiks) March 10, 2017 please tell me what line(s) has Nicki Minaj said in \"No Frauds\" that went harder than anything said on Remy Ma \"ShEther\" ??? \n— Reggie Regg (@1ReggieRegg) March 10, 2017 when Nicki Minaj's rapping turns into singing pic.twitter.com/8g0FLnSag0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T17:48:17.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
