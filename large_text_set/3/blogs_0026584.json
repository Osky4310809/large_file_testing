Rex Features Jamie Vardy went down under the challenge of keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen on seven minutes, despite no contact being made Rex Features The German defence were not happy with the Leicester striker, who is getting quite the reputation for diving \nThe referee clearly saw there was no contact and waved away the penalty appeals. \nVardy was guilty of the same thing on several occasions during the Foxes’ Champions League clash against Valencia. \nHe needs to cut it out or risk losing the admiration he gained during his and Leicester’s remarkable campaign last season. Reuters Gareth Southgate will have been encouraged by how his three-man defence performed Rex Features Chris Smalling, Gary Cahill and Michael Keane did not allow Germany a single shot on target in the first half Getty Images Gareth Southgate is proving to be quite experimental with his England line-ups ENGLAND ARE LEARNING FAST \nGareth Southgate was very much Mr Versatile during his playing days, equally comfortable in midfield, as part of a back four or equally a back three. \nAnd he is showing the same attitude in his tactics with England, and although it is still not perfect, he will be encouraged by the start his men made. \nHe opted to line up with three at the back on this occasion, with debutant Michael Keane alongside Chris Smalling and Gary Cahill. \nIt worked wonders in the opening 45 minutes, as the visitors did not allow the visitors a single shot on target. And although they were eventually undone, Joe Hart will not get beaten by many better strikes than Podolski’s. EPA Kick off between Germany and England was delayed by eight minutes Getty Images A number of pre-match tributes were paid to Lukas Podolski in Dortmund Reuters And Lukas Podolski even made a goodbye speech before the action got underway GERMANS ARE ALWAYS EFFICIENT \nThe game had been scheduled to kick off at 7.45pm – but the action did not start until 7.53pm thanks to Podolski. \nThe game was being used as tribute to 31-year-old forward after he announced his international retirement… And boy did he milk it. Ex-Arsenal star Lukas Podolski is a rap king after song gets number one in Germany \nAfter a montage of his highlights for his country was played beforehand, Poldi then went on to drag his speech out to ensure the actual match got underway EIGHT MINUTES late. \nBut never fear, despite several stoppages during the opening half, the German organisers no doubt gave the fourth official a nudge to ensure his colleague in charge blew his whistle dead on 45 minutes to get the schedule back on track. AP:Associated Press A number of England fans let themselves down again during the away clash in Dortmund Rex Features A large section of the away support could be heard singing 'Ten German Bombers' ENGLAND FANS CONTINUE TO LET THEMSELVES DOWN \nOnce again England fans embarrassed themselves with the chant of ‘Ten German Bombers’ throughout the first half in Dortmund. \nThe Football Association rely heavily on the Official England Band to drown out such chants at Wembley, but even they were powerless to mask the idiotic supporters singing the tune. \nNow, ‘Don’t Take Me Home’ ran its course after last year’s Euros, but it says something when you are praying for it to be belted out instead of the moronic reference to the Second World War. Naked England football fan dances in the stands as his team take on Germany AND THAT’S THE BARE NAKED TRUTH \nIt was not only the singing that let the travelling support down. \nA video emerged during the game of one individual who had clearly had too much – and just felt the need to take his clothes off! \nEngland fans are renowned and even revered around the world for their passion, but there is always a few that want to spoil that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:58:00.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
