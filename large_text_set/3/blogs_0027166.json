In state media photos, Kim is seen grinning and shaking hands with other excited officers.\nIt was a moment of levity from his usual alleged business of ordering executions , plotting nuclear fireworks and orchestrating major bank heists .\nAccording to the BBC , the man who jumped on Kim’s back was not a known figure in the country’s politics, but appeared to be a mid-level officer.\nNorth Korea expert Michael Madden told the BBC that the photos are part of the leader’s latest image strategy.\n“This fits into the image [Kim] Jong-un has tried to cultivate – that he is more open, on an interpersonal basis, than his father,” Madden said. “It conveys a certain sense of political confidence in his rule and leadership of the country. If he didn’t feel secure, then he wouldn’t allow these images to be disseminated – he would need to appear distant and cold.”\nGetty Images Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:30:39.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
