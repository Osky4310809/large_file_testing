A new survey found that average-sized breasts are the ideal boobs for men and women in most countries. Long Story \nYou've probably seen those side-by-side images of what men think the perfect female figure is and what women think — and you probably also realized how different the two are. But when it comes to breasts , men and women see eye-to-eye — eyes up here guys, eyes up here. \nDr. Ed surveyed 2,000 men and women in the U.S. and Europe what size breasts they're most into and the answer was... average . Not too big, not too small, just right. \nIn total, 60.4% of women and 53.6% of men said that the average bowl of porridge — a C-cup — was perceived as best. Dr. Ed \nBut there are two countries surveyed where C cups don't reign supreme in terms of desired mammaries. In Poland and Hungary, B cups are preferred. Interestingly, the average for both countries is C cups and A cups respectively. \nNot liking the boobs you're dealt isn't unique to these two European neighbors — it's a common theme in a lot of places. In places like Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal and Spain where C-cups are preferred, the average woman tends to have a B. The same can be said for the United States. \nvia GIPHY \nSo considering all this love for Cs, you'd think that women would be super stoked to have 'em. Not so. According to the survey, one out of every four women with C cups, aren't satisfied with their chests. Meanwhile, more than 40% weren't satisfied with their Bs. \nIt's sad to see when people aren't happy with their bodies — and there's really no reason for it. While average breasts might be the most popular, there are still plenty of guys who dream of small like Taylor Swift (11%), or large like Kate Upton (35.3%). There's also evidence to suggest that shape matters more than size . \nvia GIPHY \nAnd when all is said and done and people get into a relationship, 70% are happy with the breasts of their partner, according to the survey. \nSo ladies, while average boobs might be the most sought after, there's going to be someone out there who will treat yours just right, whatever size they are. Own The Conversation \nWhy do so many women get breast implants if most guys don't like large breasts? Drop This Fact \nAccording to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the U.S. had 20% more plastic surgeries than any other country when data was collected in 2014.
