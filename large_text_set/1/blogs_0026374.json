This comes on the heels of news reports of a transgender man in the United Kingdom who is putting his transition on hold to carry a pregnancy to term. The British Medical Association (BMA) has released a 14-page guidebook, “A Guide to Effective Communication: Inclusive Language in the Workplace,” to more than 160,000 members and suggests that mothers now be called “pregnant people” instead of “expectant mothers.” The example patient being cited is 20-year-old Hayden Cross — born female and now four months pregnant — who is holding off on a sex reassignment surgery, according to the Daily Mail . Cross has reportedly received death threats due to his decision to have his child. While Cross seems to be the only transitioning and pregnant transgender man in the U.K., the BMA wants the rule to be instituted, although data shows 775,000 women give birth yearly. The BMA guide’s explanation of the ban reads as follows: “A large majority of people that have been pregnant or have given birth identify as women. However, there are some intersex men and trans men who may get pregnant. We can include intersex men and trans men who may get pregnant by saying “pregnant people” instead of “expectant mothers.” Activist Laura Perrins said that the BMA’s suggestion to use the term “pregnant people” is “offensive and dangerous,” adding that this sweeping rule by the association, although intended to defend the interests of a small part of the population, will actually offend more women. Adding to the fervor of the discussion, terms such as “born man” and “born woman” are also not to be applied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T05:13:35.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
