Here are the results from 193 countries. To see a full-res version of the map, click here . \nAs Quickco’s blog post notes, a few trends here: national brand loyalty isn’t very strong, except in Germany, Italy and France (even Japan is really into BMWs), for its massive size most countries don’t seem all that interested in General Motors, Jaguar got the most searches in Belize, and in Niger, everyone dreams of Bugattis.

While we used Google to perform our analysis, Google is not the most used search engine in some large economies such as China, Russia and South Korea, so these samples will not be as reliable as they would be had we used local search engines. However, Google does still have a large presence in these populous nations, so the proportions of searches will probably be similar. \nIs it the most scientific study in the world? I dunno, probably not, and it almost goes without saying this doesn’t equate to sales. But it’s fun to see where everyone’s minds are at. \nSee more trends from the map over at Quickco ’s blog.
