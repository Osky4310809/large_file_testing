But I do,\" he wrote to Bondi Sands.\n\"I am, what could be assumed as average size, and can only think that this mitt does not fit many other mans hands out there. I am sure, much of my displeasure, that my gorgeous fiancé will continue to use your lovely products regardless of my issue.\n\"But please, in future make the mitt bigger or include an extra mitt for those men out there that must assist the women they love.\"\nSure, it sounds like a regular (and reasonable) complaint. But the post at the time of writing has had more than 28,000 likes and more than 8,000 comments.\nSeems like there are plenty of other people who have the same issue, or have other bugbears with the inadequate tanning mitt.\nEdwards told Mashable he's \"very surprised about the amount of comments I have had from other guys who have had the same issue.\"\nHowever, he's yet to receive a response from Bondi Sands with regard to the matter. Mashable has contacted Bondi Sands for further comment.\nSorry to all the extra people who may have to tan their partners now, thanks to this post.\n[h/t Buzzfeed ]\nBONUS: At 98 years old, this has to be the world’s oldest yoga teacher", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D1419736521371983%26set%3Do.216322721741598%26type%3D3%26comment_id%3D707031266127987&include_parent=false", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1419736521371983&set=o.216322721741598&type=3&theater", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D1419736521371983%26set%3Do.216322721741598%26type%3D3%26comment_id%3D1420205497991752&include_parent=false", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D1419736521371983%26set%3Do.216322721741598%26type%3D3%26comment_id%3D693869930781662&include_parent=false", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/misoLwZg.m3u8", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D1419736521371983%26set%3Do.216322721741598%26type%3D3%26comment_id%3D1631665903804602&include_parent=false", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D1419736521371983%26set%3Do.216322721741598%26type%3D3%26comment_id%3D707017066129407&include_parent=false", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/misoLwZg.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D1419736521371983%26set%3Do.216322721741598%26type%3D3%26comment_id%3D1229786593768374&include_parent=false", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/jemimaskelley/tan?utm_term=.bnyXWLnZ3#.hye0M3rQK"], "published": "2017-01-16T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T06:18:12.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
