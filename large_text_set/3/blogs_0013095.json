Highlights of Kyrgios' stunning win over Djokovic \n\"I don't take this decision lightly, these are the matches we train for but I'm in no fit state to take to the court. I'm sorry to the fans but I have to put my health first and I hope you understand. \n\"I want to wish Roger the best of luck for the rest of the tournament and thank everyone for their support so far here at the BNP Paribas Open. I will definitely be back. Thank you.\" I'm so sorry but I can't play @BNPPARIBASOPEN today. đ˘đ¤ pic.twitter.com/K5spWRgtLk — Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) March 17, 2017 \nKyrgios's sudden illness is a cruel twist of fate for the talented 21-year-old, who has shown signs of finally starting to deliver on his promise in recent weeks after a young career marked by controversy. \nHis stylish win over Djokovic was the second time in as many weeks he had beaten the former world No 1 after also defeating the Serb in Acapulco. Kyrgios stunned Djokovic with a brilliant display to reach the quarter-finals \nFollowing his win over the Serb, Kyrgios had been seen raiding a spectator's portion of chips during his doubles quarter-final with Nenad Zimonjic against Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo. \nFor those on the move, we will have Indian Wells covered on Sky Sports News HQ and don't forget that you can follow us via our website skysports.com/tennis , our app for mobile devices and iPad or our Twitter account @skysportstennis for news, reports, live blogs and expert analysis.
