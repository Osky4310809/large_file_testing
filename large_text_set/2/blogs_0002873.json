Very happy, just like any other mom,” her mother, Farimah Kashkooli, told reporters just moments after the young girl arrived.\n“It went pretty smoothly,” she said. “She is sleepy right now. She is tired. As soon as possible we are going to go through surgery.”\nKashkooli, 33, appeared happy and emotional as she hugged and kissed her daughter in front of her classmates upon her arrival.\n“This time she is on F-2 visa dependent on a student visa,” Kashkooli said.\nAlma suffers from what is known as a congenital disorder of glycosylation or CDG, which impairs the cells’ ability to communicate with each other. As a result, she can barely walk or talk and is prone to seizures. Her mother said that she was likely to go blind if barred from entering the US for her treatment.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:34:39.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
