US President Donald Trump \n“Forty per cent of Donald Trump’s fortune is tied up in Trump Tower and eight buildings within one mile of it,” Forbes said. “Lately, the neighbourhood has been struggling (relatively speaking),” it added. \nMr Trump’s wealth has been a subject of fierce debate and much speculation in recent years and he is notoriously sensitive about disclosing earnings. \nIn an article published in September 2015, Forbes wrote that no other mogul featured on their annual rich list has been “more fixated with his or her net worth estimate on a year-in, year-out basis than Donald J Trump”. \nThe magazine said that other billionaires on the list had a tendency of complaining that their estimate was too high rather than too low. \nWhen Forbes estimated his fortune at $4.5bn in 2015, Mr Trump reportedly complained: “I’m running for President. I’m worth much more than you have me down [for]. \n“I don’t look good, to be honest. I mean, I look better if I’m worth $10bn than if I’m worth $4bn.” \nMicrosoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates topped this year’s rich list for a fourth consecutive year, with an estimated fortune of around $86bn. He was followed by Berkshire Hathaway chief executive Warren Buffett, whose wealth was cited to be around $75.6bn. \nOthers in the top ten, which is heavily dominated by Americans in the technology sector, were Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, at number five, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison at number seven and Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos.
