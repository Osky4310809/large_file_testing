Gorilla glass has also been implemented behind the driver, which is noticeably slimmer and lighter than on regular GT models. The engine compartment then notes a manual latch and carbon-fiber prop.\nAir conditioning, infotainment system, cupholders, radio and storage bins have been removed, as titanium lug nuts and exhaust and carbon-fiber wheels come standard on the new GT.\nGloss carbon fiber striping appears on the exterior of the GT Competition Series, while the lower body trim is thus exposed. The cabin, on the other hand, reveals even more carbon fiber, in addition to Alcantara suede with red accents.\nUnder the hood you will then find a twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 that cranks out 647 horsepower.\nLimited to 250 models per year, the Competition Series will be sold in black, white, silver, blue, grey and yellow.\nJust last month we got a look at Fordâ€™s all-new redesigned 2018 Mustang. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:30:44.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
