You know that crunching sound it makes, that brittle snapping sound that only a truly crisp apple can make? It’s pretty great. You start to blissfully float into the flavor as the juices dribble down your contented chin. Nothing can ruin this moment . . . except for a pesky little piece of plastic. That’s right you forgot to take off the produce label in your apple-fueled excitement and now, this piece of art that once was your perfect bite has been sullied by the bits of plastic that are mashed up in the apple pulp. Spit it out, you’ll have to wait till next fall when the apples come in again. . . or will you? \nA supermarket in Sweeden has come up with a solution to this mammoth of a modern problem – they have eliminated plastic produce labels and are using lasers to label the fruits and vegetables that line their shelves. The Dutch produce supplier Nature & More and the Swedish ICA Supermarket are using an intense light (or laser for us laymen) to remove the pigment from their produce. The technique called “natural branding” and ICA estimates that these laser labels will produce about one percent of the carbon that would have resulted from the production of their plastic counterparts. On top of that, Peter Hagg, ICA’s business unit manager told The Guardian, “By using natural branding on all the organic avocados we would sell in one year we will save 200km (135 miles) of plastic 30cm wide.” And that’s just from the avocados! \nThis comes hot on the heels of several companies that are trying to provide us alternatives to plastic bags and help humans kick their plastic habit – and we need to kick it fast. Every year we put 8.8 million tons of plastic waste into the planet’s oceans and waterways, as a result The Great Pacific Garbage Patch has grown to obscene proportions. Despite this fact, global plastic production continues to go up but only 78 percent of this waste is recycled – the rest makes its way into the ocean. Plastic pollution currently threatens over 800 marine species and if we continue to pollute, this number will rise. \nAnd while Nature & More and the ICA Supermarket may have solved the problem of the perfect bite, we still need to solve the problem of plastic pollution as a whole. We will have to wait for natural branding to make its way across the Atlantic, but there are some easy things we can do right now to combat unnecessary plastic pollution. For example, bring a reusable tote with you when you go to the supermarket and a water bottle with you when you leave the house.
