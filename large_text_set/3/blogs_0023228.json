Lee Jeong-hyeop and Nam Tae-hee both let fly, narrowly missing the target before the Chinese took the lead. \nAgain it was Zhang Linpeng who was causing the problems, with the full-back storming forward before firing off a shot that was deflected wide for the corner from which Yu glanced his header home following Wang Yongpo's cross towards the six-yard box. \nStielike's side almost grabbed an equaliser in the dying minutes of the half as Ji Dong-won sent his header just over the bar before Kim Jin-su's cross was almost turned into his own goal by a bewildered Feng. \nThe Koreans introduced towering striker Kim Shin-wook at the start of the second half while Lippi brought on Wu Lei for Wu Xi, but it was Zeng in the Chinese goal who seemed to be the most active player on the pitch. \nKi, who had had a quiet first half, stepped further forward for the visitors and, just before the hour mark, he let fly with a trademark drive that Zeng pushed clear. Six minutes later the Swansea City man tried again, only for Zeng to be resolute once more. \nChina continued to present a threat at the other end, even if it was increasingly sporadic. Yu's effort was deflected to safety while Wu Lei saw his goal-bound effort saved by a sprawling Kwoun. \nThe action continued at a relentless pace and Zeng again kept China in front, diving to his right to deny another Ji Dong-won header while Wu Lei later cleared another attempt off the line as Lippi's side desperately held on for a famous and much-needed win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:01:23.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
