We’re a non-partisan organization funded by over 50,000 members–people around the world with different political beliefs–who are united in their support for space science and exploration. \nNye continues: \nThe Planetary Society’s Board of Directors and I would like to offer five recommendations for the United States space program during your tenure. \nNumber one: Keep the planet Mars as the goal for human space exploration. \nNumber two: orbit Mars first. \nNumber three: strengthen NASA science. \nNumber four: embrace commercial space. \nNumber five: Five-over-five (a five-percent boost to NASA’s budget every year for the next 5 years). \nIn his video message Nye tells Trump: \nYou have the opportunity to provide clear direction to our nation’s space program. The advances and discoveries made on your watch could be historic. \nIn a written report issued in conjunction with Nye’s video message, The Planetary Society issued the following five recommendations: Maintain the exploration of Mars as the organizing principle for NASA’s human spaceflight program Direct NASA to plan an executable, affordable path for sending humans to Mars orbit by 2033 Expand NASA’s highly successful science portfolio Continue to grow and support the commercial space industry Initiate annual five percent increases to NASA’s budget for five years \nBill Nye is currently the CEO of The Planetary Society. He is also the author of the popular books Unstoppable: Harnessing Science to Change the World , and Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation . \nAccording to the Washington Post , Trump has yet to name anyone to lead NASA. In addition, he also lacks a science advisor. \nWatch the video message below: Bill Nye (Image via Screen Grab)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T01:54:56.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
