And if March does win, it could mean millions of dollars of expenses for taxpayers. \n“There’s 10,000 prisoners in that state who have some dietary restrictions because of religion and it cost the state $12 million last year,” Leonardo said, referencing a similar case in Florida. “You’re starting to see more and more of these cases in other states.”   \nA hearing has not yet been scheduled for a case that could set a new standard for coddling prisoners . \nThe question is: Should prisoners be allowed to dictate their needs while serving a sentence for a grievous crime? And at the expense of the innocent taxpayers? \nTennessee Gov. Bill Haslam is already planning to raise other taxes in the state, such as the gas tax by seven cents, according to The Tennessean , in order to pay for other much-needed construction and improvement expenses. Taxpayers in Tennessee just don’t need the added burden of millions of dollars for the dietary preferences of criminals. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and tell us whether think March’s dietary needs are important.
