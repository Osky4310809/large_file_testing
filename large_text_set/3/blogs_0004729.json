But the recent leak purports to contain highly technical details about how surveillance is carried out. That would make them far more revealing and useful to an adversary, this person said. In one sense, Mr. Snowden provided a briefing book on U.S. surveillance, but the CIA leaks could provide the blueprints. \nSpeaking of Snowden, the former NSA contractor-turned-whistleblower, who now appears to have a \"parallel whisteblower\" deep inside the \"Deep State\", i.e., the source of the Wikileaks data - also had some thoughts on today's CIA dump. \nIn a series of tweets, Snowden notes that \"what @Wikileaks has here is genuinely a big deal\", and makes the following key observations \"If you're writing about the CIA/@Wikileaks story, here's the big deal: first public evidence USG secretly paying to keep US software unsafe \" and adds that \"the CIA reports show the USG developing vulnerabilities in US products, then intentionally keeping the holes open. Reckless beyond words .\" \nHe then asks rhetorically \"Why is this dangerous?\" and explains \" Because until closed, any hacker can use the security hole the CIA left open to break into any iPhone in the world. \" \nHis conclusion, one which many of the so-called conspiratorial bent would say was well-known long ago: \" Evidence mounts showing CIA & FBI knew about catastrophic weaknesses in the most-used smartphones in America, but kept them open -- to spy. \" \nTo which the increasingly prevalent response has become: \"obviously.\" Still working through the publication, but what @Wikileaks has here is genuinely a big deal. Looks authentic. \n— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) March 7, 2017 If you're writing about the CIA/ @Wikileaks story, here's the big deal: first public evidence USG secretly paying to keep US software unsafe. pic.twitter.com/kYi0NC2mOp \n— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) March 7, 2017 The CIA reports show the USG developing vulnerabilities in US products, then intentionally keeping the holes open.
