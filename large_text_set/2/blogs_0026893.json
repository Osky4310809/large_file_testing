It took away from the glamour of the Oscars. It didn’t feel like a very glamorous evening. I’ve been to the Oscars. There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad.”\nGlobal accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, in fact, has admitted responsibility for the mistake – saying the wrong envelope was handed to presenters.\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack \nThe firm said in a statement to PEOPLE: “We sincerely apologize to Moonlight , La La Land , Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture. The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:12:08.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
