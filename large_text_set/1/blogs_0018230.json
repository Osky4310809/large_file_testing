REX/ Shutterstock \nAnsari said, \nIt’s pretty cool to know though he’s probably at home right now watching a brown guy make fun of him though, right? \nThe problem is there is a new group. I’m talking about a tiny slice of people that have gotten way too fired up about the Trump thing for the wrong reasons. These people that as soon as Trump won they’re like, ‘We don’t have to pretend like we’re not racist anymore!’ \nThe 33-year-old continued, \nWhoa, whoa. No, no. If you’re one of these people, please go back to pretending. You’ve got to go back to pretending. I’m sorry we never thanked you for your service. We never realized how much effort you were putting into the pretending. You’ve got to go back to pretending. \nAziz Ansari also made a rather brilliant analogy between singer Chris Brown and President Trump. \nAnsari said, \nI’m sure a lot of people voted for Trump the same way a lot of people listen to Chris Brown: ‘Hey, man. I’m just here for the tunes. I don’t know about that other stuff. I just like the dancing and the music. I don’t condone the extracurriculars.’ \nIf you think about it, Donald Trump is basically the Chris Brown of politics. \nI mean, come on, this is pretty genius, right? It’s the most backhanded compliment ever, and it’s so spot on, it hurts. \nHowever, it wasn’t all doom and gloom from the “Parks and Recreation” star. Aziz Ansari also focused on hope for the future of the United States. \"Change comes from large groups of angry people.\" @azizansari #SNL pic.twitter.com/PT03JsynPb \n— Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) January 22, 2017 \nAs you can hear in the clip above, Ansari said, \nThis is a weird time. If you’re excited about Trump, great. He’s president. Let’s hope he does a great job. If you’re scared about Trump and you’re very worried, you’re going to be okay, too. \nIf you look at our history, change doesn’t come from presidents. Change comes from large groups of angry people. And if day one is any indication, you are part of the largest group of angry people I have ever seen. \nIt’s folks like Ansari, who have a real platform to reach the masses, who give me real hope for the future. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
