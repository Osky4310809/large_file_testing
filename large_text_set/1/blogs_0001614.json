This, however, wasn’t quite good enough for Anthony Garofalo, who instead converted a prototype voltmeter he made using an Arduino Uno and a tiny OLED display into something that displays the magnetic, or Gauss level. It also shows whether it’s observing the north or south pole of the magnet, which certainly could be useful in some situations. \nThough full documentation isn’t available right now, Garofalo says that he’ll make it available once he repackages everything in a smaller format with an enclosure. If you’d like to see more of his work, including the voltmeter he based this off of, be sure to check out his Instructables page and some other neat stuff on his YouTube channel !
