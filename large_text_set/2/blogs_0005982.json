We played by the rules, we don’t do anything wrong,” he said. \nLehigh Valley-area Republican Congressman Charlie Dent, who knows the family, interceded with the White House. \n“They were not refugees, they were in fact immigrant visa holders, and their green cards were soon to be processed,” said Dent. “They are now green card holders, by the way. They are legal permanent residents.” The family applied for visas more than 13 years ago in 2003. They were vetted and approved, heading to the United States to escape the war and live with their relatives in Allentown. (credit: Jericka Duncan/CBS) \nAttorneys for the Asali family told them to return to the U.S. now, after a federal appeals court put a hold on the executive order. \nSarmad Assali says today is for celebration. \n“Tomorrow’s a new day, we start with school registration, and we build our future. Thank you all! Thanks everybody!” said Assali. \nGov. Tom Wolf says the Asalis’ visas were reinstated once a federal judge halted the immigration ban on Friday. \n“You cannot say you’re not welcome here because of your religion or the language you speak or the place you come from or the color of your skin. That’s just wrong,” said Wolf.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:21:02.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
