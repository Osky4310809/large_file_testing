She was accused of allegedly taking money from Saradha group chairman Sudipta Sen, misappropriation of funds, cheating and criminal conspiracy. Her estranged husband Matang Sinh, a former union minister, was already in the custody as one of the accused in the scams at the time of her arrest. \nMatang Sinh is facing a trial before the special court under PMLA in Kolkata.
