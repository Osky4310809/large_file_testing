Bruce Cameron is staunchly defending the movie adaptation's set treatment of a German Shepherd named Hercules following outcry over a video release which showed the dog in distress while shooting a scene. \nCameron wrote on his Facebook page Friday that the viral video from the Dog's Purpose 2015 set, which dramatically surfaced on Wednesday, did not reflect the treatment Hercules received. \n\"I found the video we've all seen to be shocking because when I was on the set, the ethic of everyone was the safety and comfort of the dog,\" Cameron wrote, \"I have since viewed footage taken of the day in question, when I wasn't there, and it paints an entirely different picture.\" \n\"The written commentary accompanying the video mischaracterizes what happened,\" Cameron wrote of the TMZ post which first highlighted the video. \"The dog was not terrified and not thrown in the water — I've seen footage earlier that day of Hercules joyfully jumping into the pool.\" CLOSE x Share Hercules, the dog at the center of controversy following the release of an 2015 set video, is shown on January 19, 2017. Amblin Entertainment \nCameron explained that the churning water of the pool was not the issue which put the dog in distress in the leaked video. Cameron wrote that Hercules had rehearsed the stunt but was not used to the location for the shot seen in the video. \n\"When (Hercules) was asked to perform the stunt from the other side of the pool, which was not how he had been doing it all, he balked,\" Cameron wrote. \"The mistake was trying to dip him into the water to show him it was okay — the water wasn't the issue, it was the location that was the issue, and the dog happily did the stunt when he was allowed to return to the original spot.\" \nAs for the scene in the video when Hercules' head disappears below the water and crew members rush to his assistance, Cameron wrote that did not reflect the safety back-ups on set. \n\"I didn't like it when Hercules' head went briefly under the water,\" Cameron wrote. \"But there was a scuba diver and a trainer to protect him. He loves the water, wasn't in danger and wasn't upset.\" \nJuliet Rylance and Bryce Gheisar play with the dog Bailey in 'A Dog's Purpose.' (Photo: Joe Lederer,) \nThe surfaced video has caused an international furor, and brought concerned tweets from Dog's Purpose voice star Josh Gad and even director Lasse Hallstrom. Groups such as the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and online petitions have called for a movie boycott. During the controversy, Universal Pictures canceled Saturday's Dog's Purpose premiere in Hollywood and a planned press day. \nThe production company Amblin Entertainment is conducting a review of the filming. \nCameron questioned the motives of the unnamed people who released the 2015 video just before the Jan. 27 release of A Dog's Purpose. \n\"If the people who shot and edited the video thought something was wrong, why did they wait fifteen months to do anything about it, instead of immediately going to the authorities?\" Cameron asked. \n\"On a movie where the mantra was the safety and comfort of the dogs, mistakes were made, and everything needs to be done to make sure those errors are not repeated,\" Cameron wrote. \"But the reason American Humane certifies that no animals were harmed during the making of the film is that no animals were harmed during the making of the film. I celebrate animal rescue and am proud of the values that show up in A Dog’s Purpose .\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ka1Lcs NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
