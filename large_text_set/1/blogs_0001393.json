(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday night to say that a planned intelligence briefing for him on “so-called ‘Russian-hacking’” had been delayed until Friday, a development he called ‘very strange.”\nThe tweet was the latest sign of Trump’s skepticism about a case pressed by the Obama administration, based on the work of U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies, that Russia tried to influence the U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic email accounts, among other actions.\nThe \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017\nSpeaking outside a party at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida last week, Trump sounded dismissive of those assessments, saying it was “time for the country to move on to bigger and better things.” But he indicated that he was willing to listen to a briefing on the issue this week.\nIn his tweet on Tuesday night, Trump speculated that the reason for the delay of the briefing until Friday was “perhaps more time to build a case.”\n“Very strange!” he said in the tweet.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/816452807024840704", "https://twitter.com/@WPJohnWagner"], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:53:24.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
