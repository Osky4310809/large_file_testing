One case in particular caught the Democrats' attention, and it seems like a doozy.\n\"You rarely seem to find in favor of the little guy,\" Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono told the nominee. She specifically mentioned TransAm Trucking, Inc. v. Admin. Review Brd. , a case in which Gorsuch sided with the company over its employee, who was fired for operating a truck in a way expressly forbidden by his employer.\nAlphonse Maddin broke his company's orders. But the circumstances make it seem like he was in the right. One cold January night, after missing his fuel stop, Maddin was almost out of gas, so he pulled to the side of the highway. When he tried to get back on the highway, he could not, because the brakes on the trailer had frozen and locked up.\nMaddin called the TransAm dispatcher to report the frozen brakes, and was told that a repair truck would be sent to him. While waiting, the trucker realized his heat wasn't working. After a brief nap, he realized that his torso was numb.\nOn a second call to the dispatcher, Maddin was told to \"hang in there.\" Half an hour later, he broke the company's orders, unhitched the trailer from the truck, and called his supervisor to tell him that he was seeking help. The supervisor told him not to leave the trailer, but he drove off anyway.\nWhen the repair truck arrived fifteen minutes later, Maddin drove back to meet it. A few days later, TransAm fired Maddin for abandoning the trailer. In a complaint with OSHA (the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration), Maddin claimed that TransAm, in firing him, violated the whistleblower protections of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA).\nWhen the case reached the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, the court sided with Maddin and against TransAm. But Gorsuch dissented. He pointed out that the STAA did not prevent a company from firing an employee who decided to operate his vehicle. The law forbade the firing of an employee for \"refusing to operate\" a vehicle.\"\nGorsuch wrote, The \"statute only forbids employers from firing employees who 'refuse[] to operate a vehicle' out of safety concerns. And, of course, nothing like that happened here. The trucker in this case wasn't fired for refusing to operate his vehicle. Indeed, his employer gave him the very option the statute says it must: once he voiced safety concerns, TransAm expressly — and by everyone's admission — permitted him to sit and remain where he was for help.\"\n5 Myths About Originalism, Neil Gorsuch's Judicial Philosophy\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/21/the-real-story-about-neil-gorsuch-and-the-transam-frozen-trucker/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/15/15-9504.pdf"], "published": "2017-03-22T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T07:09:35.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
