He has no business conflicts of interest, respects the press, doesn’t undermine our military and intelligence community leadership, doesn’t praise foreign dictators, and is not hell-bent on destroying government agencies that protect our country and the people here.” \nReaders commenting about the poll on BuzzFeed’s Facebook page echoed similar sentiments about Pence.
