The man did all the talking, while the girl would not look at her or respond to her, and he was well-dressed while the girl looked “disheveled and out of sorts,” WTSP reported. She also said the man’s manner seemed defensive when she tried to interact with him. \nFrederick managed to speak under her breath to the girl, telling her to go to the bathroom — where Frederick left a note on the mirror for her. \n“She wrote back on the note and said, ‘I need help,'” Frederick said.

The man was arrested and the girl set free.   \nThe U.K. Daily Mail reported that Frederick, an Alabama native, has stayed in touch with the girl, who has gone on to attend college. \nIncreased training has helped airline personnel become more vigilant, and Frederick seemed regretful about possible missed opportunities over the years. \n“I’ve been a flight attendant for 10 years and it’s like I am going all the way back to when I was in training and I was like I could have seen these young girls and young boys and didn’t even know,” Frederick said. \nEstablished by former flight attendant Nancy Rivard, Airline Ambassadors cooperates with the State Department and Department of Homeland Security in training travel industry personnel.
