In October last year, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson blasted the corporation’s “infuriating” and “shamelessly anti-Brexit” coverage. \nHowever, the BBC also came under fire during the election campaign back in 2015, when Tories said they were “furious at the BBC coverage,” while accusing it of “unforgivably” siding with the Labour Party. \nA spokesman for the BBC defended the corporation by saying it is its duty to “scrutinize” and “hold to account” all politicians, and that that is precisely why it carries on winning public trust. \n“While we are always live to our critics and understand that passions are running high on all sides of the debate, it is the job of the BBC to scrutinize and analyze the issues on behalf of the public and to hold politicians to account across the political spectrum,” a BBC spokesman said via the broadcaster. \n“That is what the BBC has been doing. It is what the BBC will continue to do. It is precisely because of this, that the public trusts the BBC.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T11:41:51.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
