Their 30-year association came under strain when Johnson abandoned Cameron’s campaign to keep Britain in the EU, opting instead to lead the charge for the opposing side. \nThe politicians, who have known each other since their days at Oxford University, exchanged personal insults during their referendum campaign. They were members of the notorious Bullingdon Club, the elite dining clique founded over 200 years ago which is known for its hard drinking and bad behavior, including vandalizing restaurants. \nThe result of the EU referendum ended Cameron’s six-year tenure at Downing Street and 10 years as the Conservative Party’s leader.On Thursday night, the pair were photographed on the streets of Harlem, NYC, after dining together at the popular Red Rooster restaurant. \nJoanna Geary, who works for Twitter, posted photographs of the old friends as they left the restaurant. \n“I hadn’t seen David until Boris said, ‘I suspect you’ll recognize my friend David,’ and pointed in his direction,” she said.
