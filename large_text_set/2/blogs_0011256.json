Slot to 247Sports Links \nVince Young is back, or at least he hopes to be. \nThe former Texas Longhorns star quarterback and No. 3 overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft has signed with veteran agent Leigh Steinberg of Steinberg Sports. Young, who hasn't played in the NFL since 2011, wants to come out of retirement, per Steinberg. \n#VinceYoung Welcome new client @VinceYoung10 who has dream of playing more football,being role model @Longhorn_FB @LonghornNetwork â€” Leigh Steinberg (@leighsteinberg) February 15, 2017 \nYoung was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in 2006, and he played there until his release in 2011. The former Longhorns star started 47 games for the Titans over five seasons, completing just 57.9 percent of his passes for 8,098 yards, 42 touchdowns and 42 interceptions. The signal-caller last played with the Philadelphia Eagles during the 2011-12 campaign, and he announced his retirement in June 2014. \nPrior to his NFL career, Young became a Longhorns legend, leading the team to a 2006 Rose Bowl national title victory over USC in what is considered one of the greatest college football games of all time. That season, Young became the first player in Division I history to rush for 1,000 yards and throw for 3,000 yards in the same year. He left Texas as the school's all-time leader in total offense, although the record was later broken by former Longhorns passer Colt McCoy. \nSteinberg, per his website, also represents nine current NFL players, including former Texas quarterback Garrett Gilbert , and seven 2017 NFL Draft prospects.
