It was initially reported that Ranbir will don three different looks for three phases of Sanjay's life - his younger days, his contemporary look and the time when he was in rehab.

Image from Twitter \nNow, DNA reports that Ranbir will in fact be sporting six looks of Sanjay to depict various points in the course of his career. His current look seems like Sanjay's look from Lawrence D'Souza's 1991 romantic saga Saajan. Since he recently wrapped up the first shooting schedule in Bhopal Central Jail, he would probably be shooting for Sanjay's first prison term, two years after the release of Saajan . \nAlso, the Times of India reports that Karishma Tanna recently shot with Ranbir for the film. Since she is speculated to play Sanjay's then love interest Madhuri Dixit, all pieces add up to the fact that Ranbir is currently shooting for the early 1990s period of Sanjay's life. \nThe report by DNA states that Ranbir will be required to lose weight in the next two months, while retaining the long locks, to shoot for Sanjay's big break phase when he appeared in Sunil Dutt's 1981 film Rocky . Besides that, Ranbir will sport four more looks in the film, including Sanjay's second jail term and the phase when he appeared in Hirani's 2003 comedy Munnabhai MBBS . \nWhile Tanna is speculated to play Dixit's role, Sonam Kapoor is believed to be playing Tina Munim, one of the first love interests of Sanjay. Also, Dia Mirza will be seen playing Sanjay's wife Manyata. Anushka Sharma will play the role of Sanjay's lawyer. Paresh Rawal and Manisha Koirala will play Sunil and Nargis Dutt respectively. The film also stars Vicky Kaushal and Jim Sarbh and is slated to release this Christmas. \nPublished Date: Mar 21, 2017 12:15 pm | Updated Date: Mar 21, 2017 12:15 pm Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:03:20.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
