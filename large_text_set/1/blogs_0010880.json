Meanwhile, a majority — 51% — disapprove of Trump’s transition efforts. Last month, the public was split, with 48% saying they both approve and disapprove of the transition. \nEven last month’s numbers were historically low. The last three presidents all scored fairly high marks with the public on how they handled their presidential transitions. Roughly a week out from when Barack Obama took office in 2009, 83% approved of the way he was dealing with the situation compared to only 12% who weren’t fans. 68% approved of Bill Clinton’s transition in 1993 and even 61% were fine with George W. Bush in 2001 , which followed a contentious election that was decided by the Supreme Court. \nBoth surveys were conducted largely before Trump’s press conference where he called a CNN reporter “fake news,” his criticism of civil rights hero John Lewis , and his Twitter attacks on Meryl Streep . \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T03:37:03.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
