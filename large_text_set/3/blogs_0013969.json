John Hickenlooper. \n“People are saying I don’t care if he’s a Republican or Democrat, he has a great reputation and that’s what we’re looking for — somebody who can bring the right talents and judgments to the bench,” said Steve Farber, a partner with Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck and a key figure in bringing the 2008 Democratic National Convention to Denver. \nThe bipartisan backing extends to politicians as well. Former Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter recently co-wrote an op-ed in support of Gorsuch. U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. — who supports his nomination — has been an advocate around Capitol Hill and plans to introduce him when Gorsuch’s confirmation hearings start Monday. \nBehind the scenes, the judge’s support team, dubbed Team Gorsuch, includes Colorado attorney and former Gorsuch clerk Michael Davis . And Jim Lyons, once a choice of President Bill Clinton to join the 10th Circuit, has urged the Judiciary Committee to lend their support. \n“Judge Gorsuch’s intellect, energy and deep regard for the Constitution are well known to those of us who have worked with him and have seen first-hand his commitment to basic principles,” Lyons wrote. \nThe blast of heavy-duty firepower isn’t the first time Gorsuch — a fourth-generation Coloradan whose mother served in the state legislature — has benefited from top-flight help in the state. \nAs first reported by The New York Times, Gorsuch did legal work for Anschutz before his appointment to the federal bench. \nThe connection later would prompt Bruce Black, now general counsel of the Anschutz Corp., to write a letter to the administration of President George W. Bush that urged the appointment of Gorsuch to the 10th Circuit. \n“Mr. Anschutz spoke with Senator (Wayne) Allard (of Colorado) about Neil Gorsuch, and Senator Allard suggested that we pass along Mr. Gorsuch’s resume to you,” Black wrote. \nTwo days before Black sent the Jan. 12, 2006, letter on behalf of Anschutz, a major Republican donor, it was reported in The Denver Post that the three front-runners for the post were candidates other than Gorsuch. \nAsked about the timing and the process, Allard said Gorsuch and those three candidates were part of larger list of six or seven hopefuls. “Basically, it fell upon me to put forward a name and I selected Neil Gorsuch to nominate,” said Allard, who noted Gorsuch’s academic credentials and support from the legal community. \nHe said he did not remember speaking with Anschutz and didn’t know Gorsuch did legal work for him. “I don’t recall that conversation, but if they had mentioned it to me I would have told them to send it to whomever (at the White House) was responsible for reviewing that application,” Allard added. \nBlack was among the 200-plus members of Colorado’s legal community who signed the latest letter; the Anschutz Corp. did not respond to a phone call seeking comment. \nGorsuch has other ties to the Anschutz network. \nA Gorsuch spokeswoman confirmed he co-owns a Colorado vacation home with Cannon Harvey and Kevin Conwick, two longtime Anschutz associates, and Gorsuch has been an occasional guest at Anschutz’s dove-hunting retreats — a rite of passage for many state politicos. \n“I’ve been there like every other elected official in Colorado,” Allard said. \nIn 2010, Gorsuch spoke at one of those retreats and criticized the current state of civil litigation in the U.S., which he warned could price out the courts for too many people. \n“The discovery process associated with civil litigation in our country has become way too expensive and takes way too long,” according to notes Gorsuch prepared for that speech.
