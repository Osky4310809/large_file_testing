We have launched an investigation,” senior police officer Sujata Singh told AFP. \nThe 25-year-old student suffered bruising from the attack and was taken to hospital for treatment, Singh said. \nThe incident came as police stepped up security in the city’s sprawling suburbs where mobs on Monday attacked a group of Africans with sticks and metal chairs. \nPolice have arrested five people over the assault but are still looking for at least four others and have set up security checkpoints and increased patrols as part of the manhunt. \nVideo footage showed an angry mob hitting a car with sticks and kicking it, while another clip showed dozens of attackers hitting shoppers in a mall with metal chairs and garbage cans. \nHundreds of African students live in Greater Noida, where there are several popular universities, engineering colleges and other educational institutions. \nThe attack followed the death of a local 16-year-old from an apparent drug overdose on Sunday. \nPolice detained five Nigerian students in connection with the case after a group of local people went to their home and accused them of murder. \nThe students were later released after police failed to find any evidence against them. \nBut a crowd that had assembled for a candlelit vigil to demand justice for the teenager turned violent after spotting a group of Nigerians. \nIndia’s foreign ministry condemned the incident as “deplorable” and assured the Nigerian high commissioner (ambassador) that all steps were being taken to protect their citizens in India. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:13:12.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
