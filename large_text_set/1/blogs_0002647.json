The Daily Mail shared the questionable pictures showing Carey at the Original Leaf buying some marijuana.\n\n\nThere have been a number of theories about what went down on New Years Eve, with Carey's camp and Dick Clark Productions - the company behind the event - issuing statements and doing interviews sharing their own version of events.\nCarey's manager, Stella Bulochnikov, explained in detail to Entertainment Weekly just how their side's version of events unfolded.\n\"So, right when it goes live, she can’t hear anything. The ears are dead. They’re dead. So she pulls them out of the ear because if the artist keeps them in their ears then all she hears is silence,\" she explained of the moment the singer took the stage, which followed an all-day battle to get her earpiece monitors to work correctly. The production company reportedly assured Carey that her ears would work on stage, but to no avail.\n\"Once she pulled them off her ear she was hoping to hear her music, but because of the circumstances — there’s noise from Times Square and the music is reverberating from the buildings — all she hears is chaos. She can’t hear her music. It’s a madhouse. At the point, there’s no way to recover.\"\nCarey's team has gone so far as to accuse Dick Clark productions of either purposely sabotaging the performance for ratings or keeping it in the West Coast feed of the New Years Eve event so that the trainwreck moment could continue to go viral.\n\"We live in this viral world where anybody will do anything for a viral moment,\" Bulochnikov told Entertainment Weekly of the company's decision to air the performance.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T15:43:59.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
