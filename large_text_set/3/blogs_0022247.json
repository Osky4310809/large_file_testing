Don Boone, and the pair tracked down and captured 21-year-old Austin Kollas after he allegedly stole a vehicle in Clackamas, located southwest of Portland.\nThe 9-year-old Dutch Shepherd captured Kollas after he fled from the car in a parking lot, police said.\nJust over an hour later, at 11:35 a.m. local time, Spencer took down Timothy Elmore, 41, who was wanted on parole violation charges hiding from Gladstone Police Officers a few miles away. Spencer found the suspect hiding inside a trailer.\nAustin Kollas (left) Timothy Elmore and Lonnette Denison Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office Then just nine minutes later, at 11:44 a.m., Spencer captured Lonnette Denison, 36, after police said she attempted to hide from deputies in a holly bush outside her Gladstone apartment.\nDennison had warrants out for her arrest on multiple charges, including possession of a controlled substance and theft, according to police records.\n“It’s a rare feat for a Sheriff’s Office K9 to get that number of captures in such a short time frame,” Sgt. Boone said in a news release. “For Spencer and I, that was a new record — three in 90 minutes.”\nBoone has been a K9 handler for 20 years, while Spencer has been serving with the force for six years, according to the sheriff’s office.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Fox News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:32:34.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
