Pascal’s successor, NVIDIA Volta, has already started rearing its head here and there. If you want to snoop around a little, then search for Device ID 1D81 or the GPU code GV100. The GTX 1080 Ti provides great value to the consumer, especially since it’s nearly a TITAN X Pascal (even better in certain benchmarks) for a lot lower price tag. This card has effectively rendered the GTX 1080 and the GTX TITAN X useless thanks to the improved memory clocks. And with the same memory set to appear on new versions of the GTX 1080 and GTX 1060, it would be best that you hold off on those cards if you were thinking of getting either(though we wonder why you’d even want a GTX 1080 at this point). \nOne that stands out is that in all of our 4K benchmarks at Ultra settings, the GTX 1080 scored above the bare minimum of 60 FPS which means that you can now have the best 4K no-compromises experience with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. All you need is Rs.62,999. PROS Best graphics card for gaming Value for money Stock cooler needs to go Indian pricing is still a letdown NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti: Detailed Review \nAnnounced at GDC 2017, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti falls in line as yet another successful launch for NVIDIA. The company has been on a roll ever since Maxwell cards came out more than two years ago. The 980 Ti ended up providing a significant performance increment over the 780 Ti and that was followed by the Pascal series GTX 1080 which was not only powerful but was also a lot more power efficient thanks to the smaller transistor size. And the lack of competition in this high-end segment has been working out really well for NVIDIA which has enjoyed the lion’s share of the enthusiast GPU market and their stock prices attest the same. However, the GTX 1080 Ti launch was a bit abrupt. Some of the card partners that we spoke to were caught off guard by the GTX 1080 Ti announcement at GDC and had expected it to be announced a little later. But we understand the secrecy after all AMD announced its enthusiast graphics card – RX VEGA – earlier on the very same day. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition is the first to hit retail for $699 with partner cards slated to come in later in the month. What about partner cards? \nWe believe one of the reasons why none of the partners had any SKU ready aside from the stock Founders Edition cards. Usually, when new graphics cards are announced we find render images of all partner cards which are to be released. In case of the GTX 1080 Ti, we saw none of those and even some of the local partners that we spoke to were completely caught off guard with the GTX 1080 Ti announcement. However, things are turning up, partner cards from ZOTAC , ASUS , MSI and GIGABYTE are going to hit retail later this week so keep your eyes peeled. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, a TITAN X with one less limb \nThe GTX 1080 Ti is based off the same GP102 that the NVIDIA TITAN X is based on except for a few minor changes. The GP102 is a scaled down version of the GP100, with 30 SMs of which only 28 are functional. Even the TITAN X had 28 functional SMs which means that both cards have the same number of CUDA cores – 3584. And they GTX 1080 Ti is clocked at 1480 MHz which is 63 MHz higher than the Pascal-based GTX TITAN. With GPU Boost, the clock speed goes up to 1582 MHz which is 51 MHz greater than the GTX TITAN. \nThe TITAN X had 12 GB of GDDR5X RAM clocked at 1251 MHz and the GTX 1080 Ti retains the use of GDDR5X but the clock speed has been increased to 1376 MHz which effectively takes the bandwidth from 10 Gbps to 11 Gbps. This is a significant increase in memory clock and when clubbed with the GPU clock, the overall processing power is more than the TITAN X. Yep, this little beast is more powerful than the TITAN X when it comes to gaming. To add perspective, the TITAN X had a single precision processing power of 10157 GFLOPs and the for GTX 1080 Ti that number is 10609 GFLOPS. Also, since NVIDIA has done away with 1 GDDR5X RAM chip it does away with a few ROPs as well. The TITAN X had 96 ROPs in the GPU so with 1 less chip, the ROP count goes down to 88. Subsequently, bus-width also takes a hit. The GTX 1080 Ti has a 352-bit memory bus width compared to the 384-bit bus width on the TITAN X. \nEver since NVIDIA started coming out with the flagship Ti cards after the TITAN cards, they’ve followed a certain pattern wherein the memory would be half and the CUDA core count would be either lower or equal. Hence, each graphics card in a series, be it the 700 or the 900 were different from one another. The exception to this pattern being the 700 series which had three TITAN variants. So with the GTX 1080 Ti, the amount of compromises they’ve made to the GPU is significantly fewer. Hence, providing a value proposition unlike the previous generation of cards. Every GTX 1080 and GTX TITAN owner is probably hitting their head on the wall for not waiting for the 1080 Ti launch. It almost feels like NVIDIA is feeling the pressure of the upcoming RX VEGA launch from AMD or perhaps they’re feeling exceedingly altruistic. \nThat’s about it for all the changes with the GPU, let’s take a look at the specifications of the GTX 1080 Ti compared to the previous generation flagships. GeForce, now with improved DirectX 12 performance (...finally) \nNVIDIA’s graphics cards have had DirectX12 support since the 600 series but it was limited to a few APIs. And even with the Windows 10 announcement and its subsequent launch, NVIDIA did not bring native support for DirectX 12 to their graphics cards. Something always felt off. When games were set to use DirectX 11 APIs, the GTX 980 Ti would race ahead compared to the R9 Fury X but when you switched to DirectX 12, that performance gap would shrink to barely a few FPS and the 980 Ti would perform worse that itself on Dx11. One of the main features of DirectX 12 was that it was a low-overhead API and this was supposed to bring a huge increase in performance but the exact opposite was happening with NVIDIA cards. It should be noted that just implementing DX12 doesn’t help, the game developers have to put in more effort to ensure that they make the most of it. Now that DirectX 12 has become really widespread thanks to Microsoft forcing it down everyone’s throats, it only makes sense that NVIDIA should start devoting more resources to it. And this is exactly what they’ve done with the new driver update. \nNVIDIA Gameworks, which is basically a library of software tools optimised for NVIDIA hardware have been updated to add DirectX 12 support. Two of the most popularly used tools (according to NVIDIA) are FleX and FLOW which are used to improving simulation of graphics effects in real time are now optimised for DirectX 12. \nAnd it’s not just that, even VRWORKS, which is a similar set of tools for VR applications has received the DirectX 12 treatment. That’s about it for all the changes with the GPU and the software, let’s take a look at the specifications of the GTX 1080 Ti compared to the previous generation flagships.
