Multiple sources have reported that Apple will introduce three new iPads in 2017, but there's no consensus on the measurements. \nJapanese blog Macotakara and others have reported that Apple will release updates of the 7.9-inch iPad Mini 4 and original 12.9-inch Pro models -- and introduce a new 10.9-inch iPad Pro. Accessories manufacturer Studio Neat published a compelling analysis of why Apple might introduce a 10.5-inch iPad, combining the resolution of the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the form factor of a 9.7-inch iPad Pro. And veteran Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported a variation of this rumor, suggesting that that Apple will unveil a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro targeted to the business and education markets. \nApple's Phil Schiller showing the relationship between the iPad's dimensions. Studio Neat Will Apple change the iPad's display? \nKuo claims that Apple is holding back a dramatic redesign of the iPad, which could include a model with a flexible AMOLED display, for 2018 at the earliest. In 2017, we're more likely to see an iPad with an ultrathin bezel that, despite a larger display, would give it a compact footprint similar to the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro. \nAccording to reports, the top bezel would be preserved in order to accommodate a front-facing FaceTime camera, but the bottom bezel could be narrowed or even eliminated if Apple decided to do away with the home button -- a possibility raised by several sources. (Note that during the run up to the iPhone 7 announcement, there was much speculation about the possible disappearance of its physical home button. That rumor did not pan out.) \nThe Apple Pencil. CNET Will we see a new Apple Pencil? \nApple Insider and others report that Apple is working on a followup to its stylus, the Apple Pencil , to coincide with the debut of the next iPad. Provisionally called the Apple Pencil 2, the updated accessory is rumored to attach magnetically to an iPad, like the Smart Cover. And, in a particularly innovative twist, the Apple Pencil 2 is said to come equipped with a pen clip for safe placement in a pocket. Which processor will power the next iPad? \nApple is reportedly working on a more-powerful processor for the iPad Pro 2. According to Dutch tech blog Techtastic , this new chip would be the successor to the A9X that comes with both versions of the iPad Pro. If that's accurate, a beefed-up version of the A10 that currently powers the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, presumably called the A10X, would be featured in the next iPad Pro models. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has posited that Apple might reuse the A9X for a new, less-expensive iPad model. Scroll down for a reverse-chronological look at the latest rumors. February 9, 2017 \nJust weeks before Apple is rumored to launch a trio of new iPads, 12.9-inch iPad Pro stock is drying up around the world. January 19, 2017 \nNew iPads are coming in the second half of 2017. December 23, 2016 \nTSMC is scheduled to start making Apple's A10X chips for the next-generation iPad series slated for launch in March 2017. Unsatisfactory yields for the foundry's 10nm process could disrupt the schedule, supply chain sources indicated. November 28, 2016 \nApple is rumored to release new iPads in the spring, and a Japanese report claims they will be nearly bezel-less. October 15, 2016 \nApple's rumored upcoming A10X chip could make its predecessor look decidedly weak in comparison. Could this chip appear in the next iPad Pro? October 3, 2016 \nAfter Apple released a smaller iPad Pro earlier this year, there is speculation that it will roll out three new models in the spring of 2017. September 7, 2016 \nToday was iPhone and Apple Watch day. But there's more coming up on Apple's slate. September 7, 2016 Apple quietly updates iPads: More storage for the same -- or lower -- prices \nApple just made its iPads more attractive by bumping the minimum storage of the Air 2, Mini 4 and Mini 2, while dropping the prices of their more capacious brethren, and cutting a C-note off the price of both sizes of iPad Pro, too. August 18, 2016 \nTwitter wants to live stream on your Apple TV, 5G networks could be coming sooner than expected, and new iPhone 7 and iPad rumors. August 15, 2016 \nThe future is abundant with iPads, according to a new industry analyst report.
