Dele Alli steals the show \nDele Alli came on just before the hour mark and his introduction gave Tottenham fresh impetus and energy. \nAlli gave them movement and pace. Suddenly, Tottenham looked full of ideas and invention. \nHe didn’t continue his red hot streak, but no wonder why he is the man of the moment. \nGeorges-Kevin Nkoudou also made a big difference. They got there in the end. Son celebrates scoring his side's second goal (Photo: Getty Images) Heung-Min Son has a shot at goal (Photo: Clive Rose) 2. Mike Dean can have a quiet game \nPredictably, Mike Dean led the teams out before kick-off. It’s part of the pre-match pomp and ceremony which has - whether they like it or not - elevated the match officials’ level of importance. \nWe assume that Dean quite likes it as his demeanour during games - making a big show of decisions - often make him the centre of attention. \nBut this is yet another big televised game for Dean. He sent off Nathan Redmond at Tottenham’s win at Southampton after Christmas, got one badly wrong at West Ham last week and was then fourth official the following night at Crystal Palace. \nMaybe there’s too much exposure or pressure. But thankfully, he had a quiet game. Which is definitely a good thing. Albert Adomah in action with Tottenham's Harry Winks (Photo: Reuters) 3. Gabby Agbonlahor makes his point \nSteve Bruce’s Cantona seagulls follow the trawler moment \n“We threw him a mackerel,” said the Aston Villa manager about giving Gabby Agbonlahor a chance in the starting line-up. \nBruce, of course, has given Agbonlahor a second chance since taking over. There’s a lot of kissing and making up to be done after so many rows and controversies. “He’s made a few mistakes, but I’ve wiped that slate clean for him,” added Bruce. \nBut, despite looking on the chunky side, Agbonlahor looked sharper and tried. Maybe there’s a way back. Tottenham's Moussa Sissoko in action (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) 4. Tottenham’s changes didn’t help \nMauricio Pochettino made nine changes, only Toby Alderweireld and Eric Dier kept their places from the magnificent win over Chelsea. \nHarry Winks looks the next cab off the rank, nice and tidy in midfield. Vincent Janssen and Moussa Sissoko didn’t really take their chances. \nIt was a real mix and match team and it meant Tottenham lost some momentum after their impressive win over Chelsea. \nWhat a great shame the big clubs make so many changes and take some of the shine off the FA Cup.

But there’s a small pool of songs that do the rounds among fans. \nVilla fans greeted White Hart Lane with the “Everywhere We Go…” one. There’s a few originals. But so many are just copied, adapted and sung accordingly. Everyone now does the “Just Don’t Think You Understand…” etc. \nLast original I heard was by Crystal Palace. I can’t sing it. Needless to say everyone copied that. \nMore originality, please!
