(GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) Sometimes, even history’s most successful e-commerce company needs to take a moment to pat itself on the back.\nAmazon is feeling the love today, after topping the annual Harris Poll on corporate reputation with a score of 86.27. To thank customers for loving Amazon so much, the company is offering a $8.62 discount on orders of $50 or more today.\nThis is the second straight year Amazon has topped the Harris Poll, which surveys customers on categories like “social responsibility,” “emotional appeal,” and “workplace environment.”\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos. (Photo by GeekWire/Kevin Lisota) “These accolades are a direct result of this team’s obsession over customers, pioneering spirit, commitment to operational excellence and willingness to lean into bold bets,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wrote in an internal email to employees . “Kudos and congrats to the whole team!”\nToday’s stunt isn’t the first time Amazon celebrated its accomplishments with a promotional deal. Last year, the company temporarily dropped the price of its annual Prime membership to $73 after landing two awards at the 73rd annual Golden Globes.\nThe $8.62 discount doesn’t apply to digital content, video games, Amazon Gift Cards, or orders placed through Alexa, Prime Now, or Amazon Restaurants.
