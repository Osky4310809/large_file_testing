He is one of the bosses in Borderlands 2 , and is the \"Enforcer\" class playable character in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel . Background \nAs a child, Wilhelm had a mild case of Bone Waste that required him to get cybernetic implants at an early age, which would develop into a full-out addiction to cybernetics and a desire to become a full-on robot later in his life. He became a mercenary due to the fact that, in his own words: \"as a kid/teenager, I was good at fights\". He would go on to become the galaxy's most famous mercenary, having fought for every corporation and gaining a kill count equivalent to the population of a small country though his failure to protect either a president or an orphanage made it harder to get jobs in the inner world. At some point, he was hired by Jack as a Vault Hunter on Elpis for a few million dollars, helping him in his rise to power and eventually becoming his chief minion. Involvement \nWilhelm is the first major boss of Borderlands 2 . He is mentioned multiple times by the Guardian Angel , with considerable trepidation, before he is fought at the End of the Line . \nPhysically he is part Hyperion loader , with his body from the waist down replaced with loader legs. From the waist up, Wilhelm resembles an engineer with a constructor's optic sensor in the place of his right eye. Wilhelm also bears a shoulder-mounted mortar, which he uses for ranged attacks.
