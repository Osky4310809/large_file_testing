It appears that hopes are evaporating of swift action on the growth-boosting policies promised by President Trump . \nWith much of the upside already priced in, investors are now coming to the realisation that for all the talk, it might take longer than expected to push through reforms. \nMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: \nAfter the S&P 500 posted its biggest one day fall since last October last year, the question being asked is whether the scales are starting to fall away from investor’s eyes as to whether President Trump will be able to deliver anything close to what has been priced into markets since his election last November. \nEven the mistiest eyed optimist appears to be coming to the realisation that even on health care, where there is some form of consensus, reforms are likely to take a lot longer than realised and as such any other programmes like tax and banking reform and infrastructure spending are likely to get pushed further out into the future. \nHere is how US markets closed: Dow Jones: -1.1% at 20,668 S&P 500: -1.2% at 2,344 Nasdaq: -1.5% at 5,333 Hang Seng: -1.3% at 24,275 Nikkei: -2% at 19,041 \nShares in Europe are expected to open lower this morning: IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) Our European opening calls: $FTSE 7337 down 41$DAX 11882 down 80", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T10:00:49.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
