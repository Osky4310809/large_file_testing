On Futurology \nIf history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called \"future(s)\" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). \nOne of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.
