He took my two hands in his and told me: ‘You are way too valuable to sell yourself short for a guy.’ By the slight of my sad smile, he knew what my weakness was and with his eyes in mine he said: ‘A Man will fake love for sex, & a woman will fake sex for love.'” \nShe also described how she talked to a drunken man on a train. \n“As I was trying to tie my boots- because I didn’t even have the time to put them on properly before I got onto the train- a man in front of me says ‘Don’t worry, get yourself together,’ I guess thinking I was embarrassed about being in my socks in the middle of the A train in November. I looked up and gave him a quick smile. He said something else, and somehow I was now engaged in a conversation with him. I soon realized that he was drunk, and the water bottle he was holding was not holding water. \nI didn’t fear John. Instead, I moved closer to him to hear him better, despite being subjected to smelling the strong stench of cheap vodka on his breath. He was on his way from work at Pathmark to his psychiatrist. John was a Vietnam Vet, and in his words he had a disorder that made him ‘forget his personality’ from before he went to war… \nLooking at his bottle, I asked why he thought he needed it. John and I spoke that train ride about alcoholism, war, the mind, life, death and I believe it impacted both of our lives, even if for just that train ride. He said he already felt like he was dead; that life wasn’t worth living. He tried to describe that by being in the war, he felt like he was living in someone else’s grave. He told me that for such a young girl, I knew him more than his own son. Sure, he was drunk, but what I gained from a drunk, Vietnam Vet with a psychological disorder will stay with me forever; what I gained was the opportunity to make someone feel important, approachable, understood, and maybe most of all- not alone.” Vetrano Wrote About Passion, Sex, Love & Bad Relationships, Sometimes in Vivid Terms Karina Vetrano. (Instagram) \nShe titled one post, “F–k(ing) You.” It starts, “Your thick tongue Our heads turn violently from side, to side. The taste of your saliva is my favorite aphrodisiac, along with the smell of your sweat on your skin. And I’m soaking; I’m soaking it all in….” \nThe post describes sex in passionate and vivid terms. Vetrano Wrote About a Ticking Clock & Controlling Destiny Karina Vetrano. Instagram \nShe called this blog post Closing Time . \n“Watching the clock, waiting for it. \nBut when you’re waiting for something that’s not meant to nor intended to arrive, you’re fighting a futile battle with time. You pray for the gods to instill their virtuous patience in you, you make deals with them that you know you’ll never be able to keep but faith is all you have. You allot yourself X amount of time you are willing to wait, and it is all in vain. A diminished hope eats away at you. What’s left is a broken aching heart and a head full of fear. \nI can plead and beg with fate, for the hands to work in my favor, but who am I to try and control what’s not in my destiny. The hardest part of it all, is accepting that. \nTick, tock.” Many of Vetrano’s Posts Focus On Love, Either Lost Love or Hopes For Future Love Karina Vetrano (Instagram) \nShe called one post, My One & Only . \n“I wonder… His style, how his voice sounds, the shape of his teeth, his eyebrows, and fingers. What our apartment will look like when we decorate it together. How our fights will play out and how our f—ing will feel. I wonder and where he wants to travel. His favorite childhood memory, favorite movie, band, candy, and ice-cream flavor. I wonder what secret he has kept never feeling secure enough to share with anyone, until me. I wonder how I’ll know; when and where I’ll meet him. But most of all I wonder what his name is.” Jessica McBride is a Heavy contributor.
