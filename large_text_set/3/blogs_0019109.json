And we really admire her for these qualities. Unfortunately, like every famous and social media-active celebrity, Anushka too has had to face some nasty trolls online. But she has always dealt with them very well, and given it back when she needed to. \nRecently, in an interview with Bombay Times , when asked about how she deals with trolls, this is what she had to say: \"When my films are releasing, I look up a lot at my mentions, otherwise I don't bother. The best thing to do when someone is being inappropriate is just ignore and block them. Block the trolls. It is the best feeling. I believe that if you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all. We live in a world where hatred is on the rise and people think it is okay to hate. I don't want to encourage it, even if it is on social media. As an actor, I don't need any of those people in my space. After a whole day of hard work, the last thing you need is people talking bulls*it and being nasty. Sometimes, you have to become thick-skinned as an actor. You begin to understand how these people out there are insecure and unhappy about your life and success. There are a lot of misogynistic men out there, who have an issue with women expressing themselves. They cannot stand it and this is how they express it. They are actually powerless people. The only power they have is the 140-characters online.\" \nWe completely agree, not just for her, but for anybody who is facing online trolling. There's no need for so much unnecessary negativity, especially if you're not doing anything wrong. Plus, it's your life at the end of the day. You don't have to answer to a bunch of faceless bullies who have nothing better to do, than bring people down.
