The Oregon Ducks put an end to that in the Elite Eight. Oregon punched its ticket to the Final Four with a shocking 74-60 victory over top-seeded Kansas on Saturday night in the Elite Eight.\nIt was a true team effort for Oregon to make its first Final Four since 1939. The Ducks were on fire from three-point range (11-of-25) and dominated the glass most of the game. Dillon Brooks (17 points) and Tyler Dorsey (25 points) led the way in the victory, but they had plenty of help.\nOregon showed it wasn’t going to roll over from the opening tip. After Kansas star Josh Jackson picked up two early fouls and headed to the bench, the Ducks took control behind the inspired play of big man Jordan Bell. Bell was making athletic plays at both ends of the court, anchoring Oregon’s defense while also providing inside scoring. \nBell finished the night with eight blocks.\nOregon pushed the lead out to 18 points with 14 minutes left and never looked back. Kansas would get the lead down to six with under three minutes left, but that was it.\nOregon will now face the winner of North Carolina and Kentucky in the Final Four. Gonzaga has already punched its ticket to the Final Four, and now Oregon joins them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:57:56.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
