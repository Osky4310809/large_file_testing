But we are very interested in developing driver head protection and continue to work hard,” he added. \n“We are more likely to introduce a limited windscreen rather than that Halo.” \nIndeed, the idea of a windscreen or cover is “not dead” in Formula One, the FIA’s Mekies insists. \n“Technically it is possible,” he said. \n“We are currently waiting for the final decision about Halo, and whether they want the cockpit cover or something in between which is more aesthetically appealing.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T21:32:01.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
