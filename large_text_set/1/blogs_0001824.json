The New Year calls for sexier dresses, cosier coats, and a commitment to update your expiring wardrobe. Since you are already feeling far more rejuvenated (owing to your yearly resolutions), it’s time you put this new-found energy to good use…stacking trends, to be precise. Take a look at the wardrobes of your celeb girl crushes, and get shopping. Military Sweatshirts \nTake cue from Malaika Arora, and wear your oversized camouflage-print sweatshirt as a dress. The cold-shoulder detail helps smoothen the transition. Should you snap up a similar style, look for longer lengths that needn’t be paired with a separate. A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Nov 22, 2016 at 6:54pm PST Sporty Jumpsuits \nAnushka’s olive jumpsuit gets an athletic makeover with sneakers. Pick styles with minimal lines, dual tones, and contrasting palettes to make a sporty statement. Remember to not go overboard with accessorising. A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Dec 2, 2016 at 10:33am PST Tartan \nTartan’s more of a trend than a winter staple. Let Kangana inspire you to embrace the trend via a cozy winter coat. She layers her snug separate with a plain dress and ankle-length boots. This look has all the makings of a go-to winter outfit. A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Nov 30, 2016 at 6:48am PST Leather Jackets \nIf you don’t already own one, it’s time you befriended the biker jacket. Deepika shows how a fitted pair alone can elevate an entire outfit. Throw this over your most vanilla outfits, and channel your inner bad girl. A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Nov 29, 2016 at 6:08am PST Puffer Jackets \nKangana Ranaut debuts the coolest, most badass separate of the season – the puffer jacket. If volume with unadulterated style is what you have in your mind, then this winter trend is tailor-made for you. A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Dec 24, 2016 at 9:10pm PST Blush \nWinters needn't be all that gloomy in 2017. Bubblegum and rose pinks have taken over the dark wintry palette. Priyanka Chopra picks a blush dress and fiercely works it with thigh-high boots. A photo posted by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Nov 17, 2016 at 5:31pm PST Purple \nSince we’re on the subject of colours, Priyanka also debuted the other coveted colour of the season – Purple. She proves that the colour belongs as much on the Indian skin, by sporting it on a cute knit dress. A photo posted by Priyanka Chopra FC (@team.priyanka) on Dec 7, 2016 at 8:18am PST Velvet \nVelvet’s the fabric of the season. Period. You could flaunt it with a party dress, like Kriti Sanon, or reserve it for your airport travel with drawstrings, like Alia Bhatt. A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Dec 6, 2016 at 4:29am PST Victorian \nSonam Kapoor gives a lowdown on how to nail the Victorian trend. Her high-neck, full sleeved lace dress fares well on its vintage charm. Follow suit, and keep your hair decidedly sleek to let the details shine. A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Dec 8, 2016 at 1:40pm PST Lurex \nLurex’s a party must-have. Jacqueline Fernandez does a nice job of reminding us that. Her lurex xowl jumpsuit deserves pride of lace in your New Year wardrobe. A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Dec 6, 2016 at 8:25pm PST Satin Maxis \nEveningwear has a new hero. The satin maxi has come forth as a promising party silhouette. Kriti Sanon’s backless version has good times written all over it. A photo posted by Swapnil Shinde (@officialswapnilshinde) on Dec 5, 2016 at 8:47am PST Checks \nSonakshi Sinha brings back the check pattern in a look that is decidedly old school. Her school girl outfit – short skirt paired with a crisp white shirt - can be easily replicated under a long, warm coat.
