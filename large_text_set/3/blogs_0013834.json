Wenger under pressure at West Brom The crew answer your tweets on Jose Mourinho's comments regarding LVG's transfer policy, Pep Guardiola's tactics and more. \nManchester City and Arsenal are both coming off the back of embarrassing European exits, but City's will hurt more as they were ahead against Monaco. Pep Guardiola has to rouse the troops against Liverpool, who tend to disappoint against smaller clubs but should be perfectly comfortable against the Catalan and his style of play. \nArsene Wenger is under major pressure, so has to get the fans back on his side with a big win over West Brom, while Manchester United's Europa League exploits might see them tired against a team who just sacked their manager, Middlesbrough. \nChampions-elect Chelsea, meanwhile, can show they can do it on a wet, windy day in Stoke. Predict all the weekend scores below. \nMAN CITY : City haul their Champions League hangover back to Manchester with one of their historically most difficult opponents waiting for them at the weekend. Can they maintain their encouraging domestic form -- unbeaten in league and cup games since Jan. 15 -- or will the most recent setback weigh heavily on the mind? Prediction: Manchester City 3-2 Liverpool -- Simon Curtis \nLIVERPOOL : With both sides struggling to stay solid defensively, it's assumed there will be plenty of goals. Liverpool's excellent record against the better sides will be tested against a team humbled in Europe and looking for revenge. This challenge may just be a step too far for the visitors.
