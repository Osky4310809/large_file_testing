On Sunday the Ocean’s Eleven star stopped by the Sunrise of Sonning Retirement and Assisted Living Facility in Reading, UK, to wish a very special lady named Pat Adams (above) a happy 87th birthday.\nAs to how Clooney ended up at the retirement home (about an hour west of London), he and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, purchased a country home in a nearby town in 2014, where they currently reside. As part of a program to fulfill resident wishes, staff at the facility sent the star a letter to see if he would be interested to come meet Adams for her birthday, who is apparently such a big fan she talks about meeting him every day.\nBut even then, the staff at the facility were completely blindsided when Clooney actually showed up and rang the doorbell with the letter in hand.\nMalcolm Hague, divisional support general manager at Sunrise of Sonning, said: “We are so delighted that Pat’s wish came true.\n“She was absolutely thrilled to meet her great icon, and it was such a lovely surprise to see George greet her with flowers and a card.\n“This was a classy gesture from a wonderful man, and it has brought smiles to everyone at Sunrise of Sonning. Huge thank you to George.”\n\nStaff at the home say that Adams is “still beaming from ear to ear” after the impromptu visit. It just goes to show that a little kindness can go a long way in this world. And thanks to the visit, Adams has found herself a bona fide local celebrity, visited by Good Morning Britain host Jonathan Swain Wednesday morning:\nI'm no substitute for George but lovely to meet Pat today.
