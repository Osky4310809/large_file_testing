Big Sam was facing his former side (Photo: Bryn Lennon) \nIn his programme notes, Allardyce had bemoaned the state of the empire he built at the Macron, saying: “I had mixed feelings going back up to Bolton as it is sad to see the club in the position it is in. \n“The memories of the great days and the excellent team we had when I was manager will always be with me, but to see the stadium less than half-full with stands shut down and the club struggling financially saddened me.” \nNo disrespect, Big Sam, but it wasn’t exactly full to bursting in the People’s Republic of Croydon last night. \nAnd as for struggling financially, does the term ‘balance sheet’ ring any bells? Because your wage bill at Bolton wasn’t a recipe for solvency, was it? \nSeven changes or not, Palace were still able to field seven full ­internationals, and even in an ­atmosphere somewhere between echo chamber and cemetery, they struggled to raise a gallop. \nIn an opening cagier than a zoo, Palace enjoyed most of the territory but the clearer chances fell to the Trotters. James Henry put the League One side ahead (Photo: Ian Walton) \nJosh Vela’s fierce shot drifted just wide of the sprawling Julian Speroni’s left-hand post after 11 minutes, and David Wheater hooked over the top from 12 yards after a half-cleared corner. \nBut nobody banks on set-pieces more than Big Sam, and Palace were twice close to puncturing the tedium around the half-hour. \nSullay Kaikai’s wicked free-kick was barely a coat of paint away, then Joe Ledley found the net from Andros Townsend’s corner, only to be booked by referee Stuart Attwell – ­presumably for handball. \nBy the time Townsend stood up a cross for Martin Kelly at the far post, and Bolton keeper Ben Alnwick clung on for dear life right on his line, Palace were turning the screw. Benteke scored his first on 68 minutes (Photo: Ian Walton) \nBut the five previous meetings between these teams had produced only three goals, and those expecting a classic were lonely optimists. \nThree minutes after the break, however, unchanged Bolton – who suffered a shock home defeat by League One strugglers Swindon on Saturday – shocked their old manager. \nJay Spearing’s cross was knocked down by Gary Madine and James Henry’s speculative left-foot shot from the edge of the box curled over Speroni and dipped into the corner. Big Sam looked suitably concerned but finished all smiles. poll loading Will Sam Allardyce keep Crystal Palace up? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:14:56.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
