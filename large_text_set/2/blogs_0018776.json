The low-sulphur fuel is currently being offered at eight stations along the west coast of the northern state, and will eventually be expanded to 16 stations. \nAside from the lower sulphur content of 10 parts per million (ppm), compared to 500 ppm for regular Euro 2M diesel, FuelSave Diesel Euro 5 is also formulated with Active Efficiency Ingredients, promising improved engine efficiency and increased mileage. Also included are special detergents to help protect against injector deposit build-up, among others. \nThe fuel was initially introduced for the first time outside of Johor in December 2015 with four stations in addition to one at Pasir Gudang Highway 2 in Johor; the list ballooned to 85 by June last year. The company stated then that it planned to expand the network of stations offering Euro 5 diesel to at least 100 nationwide, including on connecting roads from Johor to Penang as well as on the East Coast in Terengganu. \n“With the launch of Shell FuelSave Diesel Euro 5, we are giving drivers travelling along the west coast of Sabah, the opportunity to experience our best, most efficient diesel fuel,” said Shell Timur managing director Shairan Huzani Husain. \nFor the full list of stations currently offering Shell FuelSave Diesel Euro 5 across Malaysia, please visit www.shell.com.my/dieseleuro5 .
