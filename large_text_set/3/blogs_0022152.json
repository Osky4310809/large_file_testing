Arsenal look like at the start of next season? (Picture: Getty) How do Arsenal manage to do it every season? They convince us it’s their time to finally compete for honours before spectacularly bottling it after Christmas.\nWhile the Gunners are in with a shot of lifting their third FA Cup in four campaigns, Arsene Wenger’s men are seriously struggling to qualify for next season’s Champions League.\nAntonio Conte report card: Near-perfect start with Chelsea on course for the double To add to that, doubts remain over the futures of Arsenal’s biggest three names – Arsene Wenger, Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil – and a squad overhaul is being planned ahead of a hectic summer.\nA number of players have been linked with Arsenal over recent months but, with their top-four credentials hanging in the balance, who can the north London giants realistically lure to the Emirates?\nAnd who must they consider getting rid of in the summer transfer window…?\nBig name departures Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil \nBoth Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil are yet to sign new deals (Picture: Getty) First and foremost, Arsenal must focus their efforts on securing Sanchez and Ozil on new contracts in north London.\nHowever, following a reported bust-up with Wenger, Sanchez is widely expected to move on in the summer, with the likes of Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea interested in the forward.\nOzil, like Sanchez, is yet to sign a new deal at the club and could also quit at the end of the season but there is a feeling he is the easier of the duo to replace.\nMathieu Debuchy and Carl Jenkinson \nMathieu Debuchy has had a disastrous spell at Arsenal (Picture: Getty) Others likely to depart the Emirates this summer are right-backs Mathieu Debuchy and Carl Jenkinson.\nJenkinson was very close to joining Crystal Palace in January, while Debuchy has consistently been linked with a return to France off the back of a disastrous three-season spell in north London.\nIt’s believed Marseille are keen on landing the Gunners full-back.\nLucas Perez \nLucas Perez has struggled is his debut season (Picture: Getty) Lucas Perez has impressed when given the opportunity this term but the forward has understandably grown frustrated with a lack of minutes under Wenger.\nThe Spaniard is understood to be looking for a return to La Liga after only one year in England.\nIt would be a shame given his promising displays in Arsenal colours but can you really blame him for wanting more game-time elsewhere?\nMORE: Is there a major communication problem at Arsenal? \nLast chance saloon Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain \nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain needs a big season (Picture: Getty) Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has undoubtedly been among the side’s best players in recent weeks but the Englishman is yet to prove his class on a consistent basis.\nIn midfield, though, Oxlade-Chamberlain has been a breath of fresh air amid the chaos – could this be his position moving forward?\nThe 23-year-old doesn’t have many more chances to convince Wenger and Arsenal fans that he is the future of the club.\nTheo Walcott \nTheo Walcott hasn’t kicked on after a promising start (Picture: Getty) Theo Walcott had a barnstorming start to the 2016/17 campaign and there was a real feeling it would be his year at long last.\nWhile Walcott has already had his second-best season to date in front of goal, however, he is still yet to live up to his early potential.\nIf Sanchez does leave in the summer, as expected, the England star will have a huge responsibility to get Arsenal’s goals next season.\nAaron Ramsey \nAaron Ramsey has had another disappointing season (Picture: Getty) There were hopes that Aaron Ramsey would return to his 2013/14 form, off the back of a scintillating Euro 2016 with Wales, but the midfielder has underwhelmed once again.\nA combination of injuries and a loss of form have meant Ramsey has only managed two goals in 20 appearances for the Gunners this term.\nArsenal fans are fast running out of patience with the 26-year-old.\nKieran Gibbs \nWill Kieran Gibbs be at Arsenal next season? (Picture: Getty) Another of Arsenal’s so-called ‘British core’, Kieran Gibbs has flattered to deceive in recent times.\nNacho Monreal has arguably had his worst season to date in Arsenal colours and yet Gibbs still cannot break into Wenger’s starting XI.\nIt’s believed the club are scouring for reinforcements at left-back which would appear to suggest Wenger has also lost all faith in the Englishman.\nGranit Xhaka \nGranit Xhaka has frustrated Arsenal fans this term (Picture: Getty) Too premature to suggest Granit Xhaka is already in last chance saloon? Absolutely not.\nArsenal’s £34 million summer signing was heralded as the next Patrick Vieira when he arrived at the Emirates but the midfielder has been immensely disappointing.\nAs well as being a walking red card card, Xhaka has only three goals in all competitions.\nReturning loanees Jack Wilshere \nJack Wilshere was sent on loan to Bournemouth last summer (Picture: Getty) With the likes of Granit Xhaka, Francis Coquelin and Mohamed Elneny failing to set the world alight this season, many Gooners cannot wait to see the return of Jack Wilshere.\nWilshere started his loan spell at Bournemouth promisingly but the midfielder has found himself on the bench since Eddie Howe’s formation change this year.\nThere was speculation that the Cherries wanted the 25-year-old permanently but these rumours have died down – does he have a future at the Emirates?\nCalum Chambers \nCalum Chambers could have a big season at Arsenal (Picture: Getty) It’s been a mixed campaign for Calum Chambers at Middlesbrough but, with Carl Jenkison and Mathieu Debuchy looking certain to leave Arsenal this summer, the defender could have an impact in north London next term.\nBoro have had an incredibly difficult season in the English top flight but Chambers has shown glimpses of the early promise Wenger saw in him at Southampton.\nChambers was named Boro’s Player of the Month for January which will no doubt have pleased his parent club.\nWojciech Szczesny \nWojciech Szczesny has impressed in Italy (Picture: Getty) Yes, Wojciech Szczesny is still attached to Arsenal…\nThe Polish goalkeeper was tipped for stardom when he made his breakthrough back in 2010/11, but he has spent two years out on loan at Roma.\nSzczesny has greatly impressed in Italy but, with Petr Cech unlikely to be overtaken as Arsenal’s number one, it may finally be his time to move on this summer.\nJoel Campbell \nDoes Joel Campbell have a future at Arsenal? (Picture: Getty) Wenger’s decision to let Joel Campbell go out on loan last summer baffled a large section of Gooners after the winger’s promising 2015/16 season.\nHowever, the Costa Rican has had a frustrating campaign at Sporting Lisbon, scoring only three goals in 25 appearances for the Portuguese outfit.\nTo add to his disappointing form, Campbell has been in trouble over his poor attitude at Sporting in recent weeks.\nNot exactly what Wenger wants to be hearing ahead of the 24-year-old’s possible return in the summer…\nDeadwood Francis Coquelin \nFrancis Coquelin has had a poor campaign (Picture: Getty) Ask Arsenal fans which player they most want sold in the summer and Francis Coquelin would certainly be among the most popular – or unpopular – answers.\nWhile the Frenchman’s passion and commitment cannot be questioned, his performances in recent times, quite simply, have not been up to standard.\nMissing out on N’Golo Kante was big. Very big.\nPer Mertesacker \nPer Mertesacker is yet to make an appearance this season (Picture: Getty) Speculation that Per Mertesacker will return to Germany in the summer has died down in recent weeks and it increasingly looks like Arsenal’s captain will stay on for the 2017/18 campaign.\nMertesacker, though, is a long way past his best and Wenger should really be looking to sell if he wants the Gunners competing with the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City next season.\nThe only justification for keeping Mertesacker would be as a mentor for youngsters coming through in north London.\nNacho Monreal \nNacho Monreal hasn’t convinced this season (Picture: Getty) Arsenal ace Nacho Monreal looked to have established himself as one of the most consistent left-backs in the league last season but he’s been a shadow of his former self this term.\nAt 31 years of age, the Spaniard isn’t getting any younger and it’s expected Wenger will attempt to bring in a left-back in the summer transfer window.\nMonreal will be at Arsenal next season but only as a squad player if the Gunners have any serious ambitions.\nTransfer targets Benjamin Mendy \nBenjamin Mendy is on Arsenal’s radar (Picture: Getty) With Arsenal on the hunt for a left-back in the summer, Benjamin Mendy has emerged as a potential target for Wenger.\nThe Monaco defender has been at the heart of the side’s incredible season domestically and in Europe and would be the perfect signing for the Gunners.\nSuch a move would likely see Kieran Gibbs leave the Gunners after 13 years in north London.\nFabinho \nArsenal are keen on Monaco’s Fabinho (Picture: Getty) Arsenal are also believed to be keeping an eye on Mendy’s Monaco team-mate Fabinho.\nFabinho, who was sensational as Monaco swept Manchester City aside in the Champions League, would be a brilliant addition to Wenger’s ranks at the Emirates.\nThe 23-year-old Brazilian can operate in central midfield and also at right-back.\nIdrissa Gueye \nIdrissa Gueye has had a top season at Everton (Picture: Getty) Wenger admitted in February that he twice missed out on N’Golo Kante but Arsenal have a plan up their sleeve…apparently.\nReports suggest the Gunners are lining up a summer move for Everton star Idrissa Gueye as their answer to Kante.\nThe Senegal international has been a revelation for the Toffees since moving from Aston Villa and would add energy and tenacity to Arsenal’s midfield.\nAndrea Belotti \nAndrea Belotti cannot stop scoring in Serie A (Picture: Getty) If Arsenal do lose Alexis Sanchez in the summer, Gooners will not rest until another top-class forward arrives at the Emirates.\nOne name who is being heavily linked with the Gunners is Andrea Belotti who is tearing up Serie A with Torino.\nThe Italian club revealed in January that they had rejected a £56m offer for the striker but his release clause stands at around £87m.\nAlexandre Lacazette \nArsenal attempted to sign Alexandre Lacazette last year (Picture: Getty) Alexandre Lacazette has once again had an outstanding campaign in Ligue 1 which has seen the striker linked with a number of elite European clubs.\nLyon confirmed that the Gunners had made an offer for Lacazette last summer but the French outfit turned down their bid.\nArsenal will have to beat off competition from Atletico Madrid for the France star.\nHow might Arsenal’s starting XI look at the start of next season…? \nMORE: Arsenal star admits he can’t explain club’s set-piece problem \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:55:01.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
