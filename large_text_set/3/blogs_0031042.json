But, thanks to Pennsylvania-based Yuengling's Ice Cream, they can drown their sorrows in a pint of butterbeer ice cream. \nAuthor J.K. Rowling, who created and wrote the Harry Potter series, described butterbeer to be \"a little bit like less sickly butterscotch\" in a 2002 interview with Bon Appétit Magazine. Yuengling's Harry Potter-themed dessert version sounds similar, if not more delicious: it's half buttercream ice cream and half butterscotch ice cream with a twisted butterscotch swirl. \n\"We are always looking for ways to inspire our fans and spark creativity,\" says David Yuengling, president of Yuengling's Ice Cream, in a statement . \"Whether it's our flavor names and descriptions or the recipes themselves — we're in the business of having fun. We hope we made J.K. Rowling proud with this flavor.\" A post shared by Mya (@mya_the_fangirl) on Mar 23, 2017 at 11:39am PDT \nIn the Harry Potter books, butterbeer is a popular beverage in the wizarding world that is name-dropped throughout the series. The beverage, which can be served hot or cold, is made of three simple ingredients: butter, sugar, and water. The drink is believed to contain a low alcohol content based on the effect it has on some. Butterbeer can leave house elves drunk — hopefully they don't drink and apparate — and humans slightly inebriated based on their size. \nThe fictional beverage has been brought to life before. At The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios, fans of all ages can enjoy a non-alcoholic rendition of butterbeer. This version contains no butter or dairy products and, thanks to Rowling, is made of real sugar instead of corn syrup. \nPints of butterbeer ice cream from Yuengling's Ice Cream are currently available in grocery stores. Wizard IDs not required for purchase. \nLearn more: Butterbeer Ice cream from Yeungling's", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T17:24:50.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
