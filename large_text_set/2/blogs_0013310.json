The latest report comes from CNBC , based on information provided by JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur. According to the report, Apple is working with Broadcom to create a customized wireless charging solution for the iPhone lineup. \nSur says that Apple and Broadcom have been working together for two years on this project, but he is not sure whether or not it will see a public launch with this year’s iPhone lineup, due in part to the “caution around the battery-related recall” that plagued Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7. \nSur does echo a belief that Apple will implement a glass-back design : \n“We believe the glass back cover is conducive to wireless charging as it reduces signal interference versus a metal casing,” Sur wrote. “It is possible for Apple to add proprietary features such as fast charging or extended charging to differentiate itself from the pack and enhance the value of its own hardware ecosystem.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:14:04.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
