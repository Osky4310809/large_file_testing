Plus, who doesn’t like to see what else is out there in the dating world without any real pressure? A dating app is ideal for looking for love and then deciding at a later date if it’s actually meant to be.\nIn preparation for the swiping Sunday experience, Tinder released a top 10 list of cities that had the most swipes on last year’s Dating Sunday.
