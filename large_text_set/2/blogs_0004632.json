The drummer just got out of a Stevie Wonder gig. The bass player plays with everyone you can imagine. Keyboard player plays with Justin Timberlake and Tony Bennett. These guys are the guys, you know? So it was anything but a pop gig.” \nBettencourt, who also played on Rihanna's albums Rated R , Loud , Talk That Talk and the recent Anti, opted to sit out the pop star's 2016 tour so he could stay in Los Angeles to work on new material with Extreme. He also recently launched his own company, Atlantis Entertainment, and sometimes guest curates the \"Soundcheck Live\" all-star jam sessions at Lucky Strike in Hollywood.

Photo by Mackie Osborne \nOn Dec. 27 and 31, bassist Steve McDonald played shows featuring all three of the bands he’s in: sludge-rock pioneers the Melvins, punk supergroup Off! and veteran power-pop combo Redd Kross. McDonald played the same Gibson Ripper bass all night, but he did change shirts for each set, and had to move his amp a little farther away from the drums to make way for his brother Jeff’s guitar amp before Redd Kross played. \nSurely there must’ve been something else interesting about playing with three notable bands in one show? “I get paid three times, that’s great,” McDonald deadpans before adding, “I just feel really lucky to be in three great bands.” \nIt takes McDonald about 20 minutes to drive in his Dodge Durango from the Glassell Park rehearsal space Redd Kross and Off! share to the Melvins' space in a Sunland complex otherwise populated by automobile customizing shops. “I get to drive on my favorite freeway in Los Angeles, which is the 2, going between the places,” McDonald says, sitting at Dale Crover's drum kit in the Melvins' practice space. “And it’s usually pretty smooth traffic wise. So it’s actually kind of ideal.” \nMcDonald keeps track of his triple-band schedule on his iPhone calendar, although he admits he double-books himself for rehearsals sometimes. “But everybody’s cool, we’re all grown-ups.” When he does have time off, McDonald’s ideal day is “kicking it around at home” in the Los Feliz area with his wife and young son. \nJeff and Steve McDonald founded Redd Kross in Hawthorne in the early '80s, when they were still in their teens. \"For years I was just in one band,\" McDonald says, \"and only had one plan and one way of doing it. And that was great. I'm grateful for Redd Kross for all those years.\" \nHe joined Off! in 2009 and the Melvins just a couple of years ago. McDonald says playing with Off!, in particular, has built up his bass stamina “because of all those fast, Dee Dee Ramone-style eighth notes.” Playing with the Melvins has involved learning that band’s alternative tunings. Playing with three different active bands helps keep him musically on his toes and entertained. \nAs he's gotten older, McDonald says his motivations for being in a band have evolved. \"It can’t always be that fantasy of the four Beatles or Kiss — you know, each member has their own fans and the band all lives in a house together. That fantasy, as much as I loved it, I had to let go of it long ago. And what I landed on is like, ‘Oh, OK, so if we’re all grown up about this we can be a bunch of different things between a bunch of different bands and just be considerate to each other.’ So far, it’s kind of working out. \n“It’s not for everyone,\" he admits. \"Buzz [Osborne, Melvins guitarist] and Dale, the whole key to success for them is there’s no Plan B, and it’s really been inspiring to me. I think more young musicians will find themselves down my path than Dale and Buzz’s because I think their path is very unique, that the first band they were in has been the band they’ve been able to sustain themselves in all these years.\" \nMcDonald has some advice for those hypothetical young musicians who, in today's music industry more than ever, are unlikely to have a viable career in just one band. \"If it turns out that you’re more like me than Buzz and Dale and you do have to do Plan B, C and D, rather than think of it as all these other things you have to do, you could think of it as all these other things that you get to do. And I think that’s been key for me. ‘OK, something else I get to learn to do.’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T20:02:37.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
