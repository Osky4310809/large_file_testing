Is it like an Amy Adams and Christian Bale in American Hustle thing? What happened between the Stussy brothers when they were kids? What kind of monster would try to hurt Carrie Coon? Why is David Thewlis so terrifying? And most importantly, can you make meth from frozen orange juice concentrate? \nApril 19, when Fargo returns, can’t get here soon enough.
