Heller, in which the high court determined that individuals have the right to own some type of guns but not necessarily all kinds without restrictions.\n\"Both before and after [the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut], similar military-style rifles and detachable magazines have been used to perpetrate mass shootings in places whose names have become synonymous with the slaughters that occurred there,\" he added, according to The Baltimore Sun.\nThe dissenting judges countered that the state banned the weapons due to a reputation gained by the actions of a few, saying that people frequently purchase rifles like the AR-15 for home defense and other uses.\n\"As long as the weapon chosen is one commonly possessed by the American people for lawful purposes -- and the rifles at issue here most certainly are,\" wrote Judge William B. Traxler in a dissent, according to The Washington Post. \"The state has very little say about whether its citizens should keep it in their homes for protection.\"\nTraxler then said that his fellow justices who ruled in favor of the gun ban have \"gone to greater lengths than any other court to eviscerate the constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:21:29.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
