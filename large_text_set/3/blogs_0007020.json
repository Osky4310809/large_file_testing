  \nA premature baby that weighed just over 1lb after being born more than two months early defied the odds and stunned doctors when she started breathing on her own. \nClare Payne-Cooper, 34, and husband Robert, 35, from Dudley, in the West Midlands, were told during their 28 week scan that their baby would not live as she had stopped growing. \nThe devastated parents prepared for the worst and, two and a half months before her due date, Savannah was born via emergency C-section . \nThe tot weighed just over one pound but doctors were stunned when she started breathing by herself. \nShe spent the next 11 weeks in hospital fighting for her life and despite still needing oxygen, Savannah now weighs six pounds and is back at home with her parents . \nClare, a family support worker, said: \"Savannah is our little miracle, I couldn't believe how small she was, my wedding ring was bigger than her hand.\" Read More The nurses called the tiny tot 'Tinkerbell' when she arrived (Photo: Caters) \n\"At first we were absolutely devastated when we were told our baby wouldn't make it,\" Clare said. \n\"At our 28 week scan, Savannah appeared to be really small and we were told there and then that she was going die. \n\"Doctors found I had restricted blood flow to my placenta and that's why she wasn't developing. \n\"We were given a glimmer of hope after she was transferred to another hospital but it was still very much touch and go. \n\"I had an emergency C-section three days later, which was terrifying, but thankfully she pulled through. \n\"The staff named her Tinkerbell because she was so small, but she now weights six pounds and we have finally been able to bring her home.\" Read More Mum watched as her premature baby was 'left to die by doctors' because he arrived before abortion limit The couple took their baby girl home when she weighed just four pounds (Photo: Caters) \nClare and Rob had been trying for a baby for nearly three years and so were thrilled when they found out Clare was expecting. \nBut Savannah's life hung in the balance when she was born on November 1, via emergency C-section, weighing just 21 ounces. \nShe added: \"We couldn't believe it, Savannah was breathing on her own and didn't need ventilation which shocked everyone. \n\"We had a baby grow that was for babies weighing just one pound, but even that was too big for her. \"She was just so tiny and was surrounded by teddy bears that were bigger than her. \n\"At four days old, once she was stable, she was transferred to New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton and was placed on high flow oxygen until she got to 35 weeks. \n\"In total she spent 11 weeks in three different hospitals, it was really difficult as all we wanted to do was bring her home.\" \nOn January 16, four days before her due date and weighing just four pounds, Clare and Rob were able to bring their little girl home.

Now she's home we can't believe she's actually here. \n\"She's been doing really well ever since and now weighs just over six pounds. \n\"Next week doctors are planning to take her off oxygen to see how she gets on and we are still waiting on the results of what caused it all in the first place. \n\"We are holding a fundraising event on April 2, as we didn't get to have a baby shower we will be celebrating her birth then and also raising money for the amazing hospitals that cared for Savannah. \n\"We received so much support and help from the families we met during our time in hospital, they really helped us pull through a really difficult time. \n\"We wanted to share our story in the hope of helping others who might find themselves in the same situation as we did.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T13:42:56.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
