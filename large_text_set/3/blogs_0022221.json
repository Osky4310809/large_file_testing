Lights out for the 2017 season curtain-raiser at 6am on Sunday March 26 \n\"The reason I say that is because he's come from Mercedes where he's orchestrated a huge amount of their success over the last three years or so, so he knows that car inside out. He knows what it takes to make this current era of Formula 1 work very, very well. \n\"What normally happens when you leave a big team like that, you have at least six months of gardening leave. I think the process has been sped up in allowing him to join Williams so quickly because they had to do this deal with Williams getting Valtteri [Bottas] over at the last minute to replace Nico Rosberg. \n\"I think part of that conversation meant that Paddy was allowed to start a bit sooner at Williams. \n\"He comes to Williams with a huge amount of information, experience and knowledge which will now be fed directly into that Williams organisation. That could be a game changer.\" \nLowe succeeded Pat Symonds, now a Sky Sports F1 analyst , as Williams' chief technical officer and he has also taken a shareholding in the Williams Group and joined the board of directors. \nLowe began his career at Williams in 1987 and spent six years with the team, during which time Nigel Mansell won the world championship. His following 20 years at McLaren brought three more drivers' titles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T10:13:51.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
