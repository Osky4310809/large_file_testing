His brown eyes, barely open, couldn’t register his owner’s panicked face. He was high,” the outlet reported of the dog owner’s terrifying experience.\n“I was pretty much having a nervous breakdown,” Braden told the paper. “It’s really scary to see your baby like that.”\nShe rushed the typically friendly and energetic pup to an emergency animal hospital when he started to “seize” and “dribble urine.”\nFinn was being tested to determine what had poisoned him and Braden realized the dog must’ve accidentally ingested a marijuana-laden “edible” at the party the night before.\nShe said partygoers were eating weed cookies and one of her friends stuffed one in their pocket, where Finn apparently found it and gobbled it up, the report stated.\nMarijuana affects dogs differently than humans — it’s toxic for dogs and could be fatal in large doses.\n“The lethargy and fogginess that might make a pot brownie fun for a human can render a dog incapable of basic functions. In rare cases… a dog can undergo gradual paralysis and die,” the outlet wrote, adding that fatal cases are rare.\nFinn was given charcoal to help him vomit out the pot and 12 hours and $1,000 in vet bills later, he was safe to go home.\nBraden said six weeks later Finn is back to his normal, “happy-go-lucky self with no lasting effects.”\nDespite the mounting body of evidence showing marijuana to be extremely beneficial to people suffering from things like cancer, chronic pain and depression, users need to take extreme care in storing their medicine and recreational pot in a place animals can’t access.\nThe Coloradoan reported veterinarians at Fort Collins Veterinary Emergency and Rehabilitation about 60 miles north of Denver see between 5 and 10 cases per week of marijuana toxicity in dogs.\nThey also cited a 2012 study where researchers found a positive correlation between marijuana toxicity cases in dogs and medical marijuana licenses in Colorado.\nVeterinarians recommend bringing any animal who might have ingested marijuana to an animal hospital as soon as possible and to not fear any repercussions.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:21:11.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
