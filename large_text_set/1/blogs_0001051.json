Damn. Dukes. \nWe see this in every sport, every year. Someone will get the Kentucky Wildcats 40-0 tattoo in mid-February, or the “Nationals 2015 World Series” tattoo, or who could forget this Lions tat \nBut nothing beats a JMU FCS National Championship tattoo on your ass. The FCS Natty is what it’s all about, folks. It’s why students go to JMU to begin with- it’s not for the 65/35 hot girls to average guy ratio, the scenic campus, the great academic reputation, none of that. It’s to win FCS titles. \nThe only regret our friend here is going to have is not getting it bigger, more colorful, and on a place besides his ass cheek. He might have to get another one after Saturday just to show it off. One for the public, and the ass tat for special viewings. Only seems right.
