KFC is the largest by far with more than 4,100 domestic outlets.\nYet despite a growing appetite for chicken — chains like McDonald’s and Shake Shack have launched their own friend chicken sandwiches in recent years — KFC has been struggling, leaving an opportunity for competitors. Popeyes has been one of the beneficiaries of KFC’s troubles, with its store count and sales both increasing in recent years.\nPopeyes’ growth in store count (top) and same store sales (bottom) View this image ›\nRestaurant Brands International\nID: 10567617 There is also a lot of room to grow overseas too, as Popeyes only has about 600 international locations, mostly in Turkey, Korea, and Canada.\nIt’s unclear how quickly Popeyes will expand following the deal. A Popeyes spokesperson declined to comment on specific plans.\nAccording to an analyst note by Cowen and Co. , one of Burger King’s biggest strengths “is in establishing master franchise agreements to help grow the brand in international markets.”\nRBI is only now growing its Tim Hortons chain internationally, with three master franchise development agreements in the Philippines, the UK and Mexico, although “these agreements took longer to strike than investors expected, while no stores have been opened under these agreements as franchisees are building the supply chain,” the Cowen analysts wrote. Delays with Tim Horton could signal slower progress for Popeyes as well.\nPopeyes has been renovating stores and recently started a program to address service problems at its restaurants. “I can say candidly that our guest experience has not been up to the standard of our food. Our franchisees would agree,” Dick Lynch, the company’s chief brand officer, told BuzzFeed News last year.\nPopeyes Is Tackling The Dreadful Service At Its Restaurants Burger King And Popeyes Could Merge And Become A Chicken And Burger Giant", "external_links": ["http://www.cowen.com/"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:02:52.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
