That’s ‘all’ West Ham will get for Dimitri Payet. \nThe former Hammer and Griezmann were France’s two standout players at Euro 2016 but there’s a stark difference in how they’ve been valued. \nPayet’s £25 million sale back to Marseille means West Ham only earn £15m more than what they paid the French club for his signature in 2015, while his international teammate has been linked with a move away from Atletico Madrid worth around $150 million (£90m). \nIn July West Ham co-chairman David Gold said the club wouldn’t listen to offers less than £50m, especially as he had signed a new £125,000 a week five-and-a-half-year contract in February. \nHowever the talented attacker’s petulance on and off the field got him exactly what he wanted (a return to his former club), and now his transfer figure is dwarfed by other big-name, big-money but consequently underwhelming January swoops.

Carlo Ancelotti (L) and Fernando Torres after signing for Chelsea. Source: Getty Images \nAccording to Gold, the transfer had nothing to do with money but rather offloading a player who was doing a disservice to the club. \nThe 29-year-old, who starred with 12 goals last season, had effectively gone on strike at the beginning of the month. \nPayet stunned West Ham boss Slaven Bilic earlier this month when he said he would not play for the club again and his and his wife’s priority was a return to France and his former club. \nPayet had been demoted to train with the Under-23 side as he was frozen out by Bilic and his teammates after his refusal to play. \nHe was erased from their WhatsApp team conversations and excluded from team dinners and had also attracted the ire of the fans.

Source: AFP \nHis photograph outside the ground had to be guarded by a steward at home matches and the fans normal laudatory chant of him was replaced by more abusive terms. \nGold says he wanted Payet to stay to make an example, but ultimately the player’s “commitment and respect” wasn’t in line with that of the club or its fans. \n“The Club would like to place on record its sincere disappointment that Dimitri Payet did not show the same commitment and respect to West Ham United that the Club and fans showed him,” Sullivan said in a statement. \n“To be frank, my Board and I would have preferred for him to have stayed in order to make an example of him, as no player is bigger than the club.” \nBut in the end Payet got exactly what he wanted - a return to Marseille. Saido Berahino did the same thing. \nThe 23-year-old striker recently moved to Stoke after a “very hard” stint at West Brom where he hadn’t played since September.

Source: AFP \nBerahino had attracted interest from Tottenham after scoring 20 goals in 45 appearances in 2014-15, but reacted angrily when his club turned down a Spurs bid on Deadline Day in summer 2015. \nTwo months later he tweeted he would never play again for the Baggies while then-chairman Jeremy Pearce was at the helm. \n“They rejected bids [from Spurs] and that was the end of it,” said Berahino. \n“No-one ever sat me down and told me, ‘the reason we are not selling you is because of X,Y,Z.’ \n“They just left it and I carried on doing what I was doing.” \nManager Tony Pulis revealed he hadn’t played the striker since September due to his lack of fitness, but the club still offered him a new deal for the third time in December. \nHowever, with his current contract set to expire at the end of the 2016-17 season, the striker moved to Stoke. \n“I just thank Stoke for having so much faith in me, for coming window after window, wanting to sign me,” he said.

You live and learn, I guess. \n“I take all my actions, all the wrong things that I did, and, as I’ve said before, the West Brom fans deserve an apology from me for the way I’ve gone on.” \nBut will Payet apologise to the Hammers in the same manner? \nFor now it seems he’s too preoccupied with his homecoming. \n“We’re going home,” Payet tweeted alongside a photo of a small private plane with its door open.
