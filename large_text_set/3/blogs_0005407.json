Kim, who has feuded on and off with Minaj for years, recently told Billboard that people still ask her to wear the purple outfit again. \"That's bulls--t. They don't want to see me in that outfit,\" she joked. Nicki Minaj's Wildest Hairstyles! \nMinaj flaunted her racy ensemble on social media on Saturday, sharing pictures of herself standing in front of the Eiffel Tower and sitting in the audience during the fashion show. In one video, a fan told her, \"You are so beautiful. If I would be like you I would walk naked.\" Minaj tried to stifle her laughter in the clip, later explaining on Twitter, \"5 seconds b4 this, she had said the exact same thing. But I guess her camera didn't record it.
