It even included games that are typically priced higher than the bundle itself, like Jonathan Blow's brain-busting puzzle game The Witness (which is usually $39.99). \nSadly, the bundle is no longer available as it was a one week only offering. \nHumble Bundle launched the promotion by saying it would match up to $300k of the proceeds to the charities listed above. Upon the promo coming to a close, the Humble Bundle organisers tweeted that it raised $6.43m not including the $300k it would match, bringing the total to $6.73m.
