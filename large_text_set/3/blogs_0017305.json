The Flying Antelopes crashed out 5-3 aggregate despite beating Zamalek of Egypt 2-1 in Enugu at the Weekend. Orji Kalu \nKalu said :”This is a terrible result. I thought Rangers would fight like wounded Lions inspite of the 4-1 first leg deficit. Scoring three goals at home was not out of this world. They did it against another Egyptian side, Mehalla in 1975. The same happened to Zambia’s Green Buffaloes in 1976.” \nThe former Abia State governor was so sure the Coal City Boys would stop the North Africans especially after Rivers United crumbled in Sudan leaving Nigeria with only a team in the competition. \n“Rangers had also beaten North African teams silly at home in the past. In 1982, they bullied Algeria’s RS Kouba 5-0. Al Hilal of Sudan fell 4-0 in 2006 while in the 2003 CAF Cup, the Flying Antelopes gave Al Ahli, Egypt a 4-0 drubbing. The same result was achieved in the 2004 CAF Confederations Cup when they hit Al Masri and Al Hilal 4-0 respectively. So I had no fear about beating Zamalek,” Kalu added. \nHe urged the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to play a more active role in the country’s preparation for continental competitions especially now that Amaju Pinnick has won a place in the CAF Executive Committee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:14:39.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
