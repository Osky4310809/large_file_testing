I beat him, I didn’t cry, I didn’t complain. \n“When I faced Oscar De La Hoya, he was the A side, I was the B side. I didn’t cry, I didn’t complain, I beat him and I became the A side. \n“For Conor McGregor , I’m coming out of retirement, just to fight Conor McGregor. I don’t want to hear no more excuses about the money, about the UFC. Sign the paper with the UFC so you can fight me in June. Simple and plain. Let’s fight in June. \n“Today, I’m officially out of retirement for Conor McGregor. We don’t need to waste no time. We need to make this s*** happen quickly. Let’s get it on in June.” \nThe greatest barrier to Mayweather and McGregor’s meeting, which would likely be the biggest pay-per-view fight of all-time, is McGregor’s contractual situation with the UFC. \nThe mixed martial arts promotion company has exclusive rights to promote all fights in which its fighters are participating. \n(© Independent News Service)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T05:27:28.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
