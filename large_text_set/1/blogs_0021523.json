(Tim Schwartz/Baltimore Sun video) \nSpano managed to get behind Crawford late in the standing position, but the Cavaliers wrestler scrambled his way to the mat with a Peterson roll and ended up on top with a takedown with 28 seconds remaining. Crawford held Spano down the rest of the way to win a 4-3 decision and remain undefeated on the season at 38-0. \nIt’s the second straight defeat for Spano (29-2), who won 74 straight matches from the 2015 state tournament until Jan. 21. \n“I came in knowing he was a state champ, but I knew I had to wrestle him like he was another wrestler. I knew I had to go in and not think about who he was and wrestle like how I wrestle and wrestle to win,” said Crawford, who finished second at the MIS tournament last year competing for McDonogh. “I knew I had to get the takedown to win and he was stopping my under hooks and Russian ties ... I just went for it and got into a Peterson and then rode him out. Leading into states I knew I had to win this match because I’ll probably have to wrestle him again. A win here will help me keep my head up and go in strong.” \nSouth Carroll (24-3) led 33-0 after seven matches that included a 24-second pin from two-time state champion Joey Thomas (126) and a 25-8 technical fall victory from two-time state titlist Jamar Williams (170). Aside from Bohan, Marriotts Ridge (13-6) got victories from Troy Grandstaff (182), who received a forfeit, and Joey Naidu (220), who won by fall in 27 seconds. \nHamper said his team learned some lessons Saturday and that they still need to improve in order to capture their fourth straight state tournament championship. \n“Marriotts Ridge is a good top team and they rode us a little more than I’d like, so we have to work on getting our from the bottom,” he said. “But for the most part our guys battled hard and we’re where we need to be at this point of the season. Are we at our best? No, but we’re peaking toward the end of the year to be there.” \nSouth Carroll (24-3) — 52, Marriotts Ridge (13-6) — 15 \n126: Joey Thomas (SC) pinned Colin Wiggins (MR), 0:24 [6-0] \n132: Cam Werner (SC) dec.
