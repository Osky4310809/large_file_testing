Don Braid: It’s last call for Alberta PCs unless one of Jason Kenney ’s opponents quits In more sour news for the NDP, Premier Rachel Notley’s performance was disapproved by 57 per cent of respondents, compared to 37 per cent approval. \nJean in contrast had an approval rating of 64 per cent, with only 22 per cent disapproving of his performance as Opposition leader. \nThe Wildrose leader recently came out in favour of forming a single conservative party if it was approved by members and said he would step down to contest the leadership of the new party if it goes ahead. \nJean could end up squaring off against Kenney, who has pushed conservative unity on to the provincial agenda in his run for the PC’s top job.  \nTyler Marr /Postmedia Wildrose Leader Brian Jean. Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt said there is little in the poll that is surprising. \nHe noted that while there are obstacles to unification — provincial law doesn’t allow official party mergers, so Kenney wants a new party while Jean wants unification to occur with Wildrose as the legal mechanism — but the prospect of a united party is looking likely. \n“I thought this was going to be much more difficult before Kenney launched it but every indication that I’ve seen now is that it’s going to happen,” said Bratt. \n The poll also shows strong support for the federal Conservatives in Alberta, with 67 per cent support among leading and decided voters, compared to 24 per cent for the Liberals, six per cent for the NDP and four per cent for the Greens. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has a disapproval rate of 58 per cent while 38 per cent of Albertans approve of his job performance.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:50:20.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
