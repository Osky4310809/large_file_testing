Califano Jr. — the former U.S. secretary of health, education and welfare under President Jimmy Carter — and his wife, Hilary, who were trying to enjoy a quiet dinner.\nOnlookers said Schumer was incensed that Hilary — the daughter of William S. Paley, the founder and chairman of CBS — had voted for Trump, even though her husband, Joseph, is a well-known Democrat.\nOne witness said of the restaurant rant, “They are a highly respected couple, and Schumer made a scene, yelling, ‘She voted for Trump!’ The Califanos left the restaurant, but Schumer followed them outside.” On the sidewalk, Schumer carried on with his fantastical filibuster: “ ‘How could you vote for Trump? He’s a liar!’ He kept repeating, ‘He’s a liar!’ ”\nHilary confirmed the confrontation, telling Page Six, “Sen. Schumer was really rude . . . He’s our senator, and I don’t really like him. Yes, I voted for Trump. Schumer joined us outside and he told me Trump was a liar. I should have told him that Hillary Clinton was a liar, but I was so surprised I didn’t say anything.”\nThis isn't the first time Senator Schumer has gotten emotional about President Trump. After Trump announced his immigration order back in January, Schumer held a press conference at which he called the order \"mean spirited\" and shed copious tears .\nSchumer: 'Demon of anti-Semitism' Has Returned with 'New Virulence'\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/28/report-sen-schumer-harasses-well-connected-woman-at-ny-restaurant-because-she-voted-for-trump/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/27/schumer-goes-off-on-trump-supporter-at-nyc-restaurant-witness-says.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-UzxqpPLc8"], "published": "2017-03-28T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:41:59.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
