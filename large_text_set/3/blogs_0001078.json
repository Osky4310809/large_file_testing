If you can recall, the Dendrobium is touted as Singapore’s first electric hypercar, developed in association with Williams Advanced Engineering. \nAs the video shows, the car’s styling features plenty of aggressive and sharp lines both on the exterior and interior. According to the company, the car’s bodywork is primarily made of aluminium, carbon fibre and glass, including for the two-seater central pod you see here. \nDespite its menacing appearance, the Dendrobium is pretty in touch with nature, as it’ll feature automatic roof and doors which open in a “synchronised, theatrical manner, resembling a fully-opened dendrobium flower, a genus of orchids native to Singapore.” \nNo official word on the technical details on the car but the company has stated the Dendrobium will feature the “latest in e-powertrain development.” Along with the usage of the term “hypercar,” expect levels of performance that should humble even the most potent form of the Tesla Model S. \nMore details of the Dendrobium should be provided when the car makes its debut in Geneva really soon. As a bit of side info, Vanda Electrics’ other products include an electric mini truck called the Ant Truck and an electric motorbike dubbed Motochimp.
