After chief minister Akhilesh Yadav emerged as victorious in the acrimonious family feud nearly a week ago, it was being taken for granted that the alliance between Congress and Samajwadi Party (SP) was a done deal. Then what went wrong during the talks that the alliance was almost called off? Was it really Priyanka who saved the alliance? Reports suggest it was not Priyanka but Sonia Gandhi’s last minute intervention that saved the alliance.\nThe foundation for talks between SP and Congress were based on a weak wicket right from the start when former bureaucrat and Gandhi loyalist Dhiraj Shrivastava was deputed to front the talks. This had baffled most Congressmen as well but no one dared voice their concern as this decision was taken by Priyanka Gandhi. The euphoria was soon over when Congress demanded 138 seats instead of the 100 seats offered to them after Ajit Singh’s RLD decided to walk out of the alliance. Rather than understanding ground realities, a marginalised Congress tried to punch way above its weight by demanding extra seats.\nAkhilesh refuses to be awed by Gandhi scions’ aura https://t.co/9SC2gccslh\n— TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) January 21, 2017\nThis was a golden opportunity for Rahul Gandhi to leave a long-lasting impression of his leadership and camaraderie with Akhilesh by sealing the alliance quickly. Instead, Congress chose Shrivastava, Raj Babbar and poll strategist Prashant Kishor to handle such a delicate affair. This reflected poorly on the Congress high command where Priyanka has been the mainstay of the party’s strategy in UP. The situation reached alarming levels by Saturday when SP’s top leadership is believed to have conveyed the message that the alliance is as good as over.\nSamajwadi Party & Congress seal Uttar Pradesh poll pact to keep BJP, BSP at bay https://t.co/uSX5ur83fF\n— TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) January 23, 2017\nRealising that her daughter had been unable to deliver the goods in her first major political assignment, Sonia Gandhi swung into action. As per reports, she spoke to Akhilesh and assuaged his feelings about political lightweights from her party leading the talks. She advocated for the alliance as the need of the hour and it was this exercise that put the alliance firmly back on track. As expected, all Congress leaders immediately gave full credit to Priyanka for a job done so ably by her mother.", "external_links": ["http://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-47750736,width-672,resizemode-4,imglength-11910/news/politics-and-nation/sonia-gandhi-priyanka-rahul-leave-for-short-visit-abroad.jpg", "https://t.co/9SC2gccslh", "https://t.co/uSX5ur83fF", "https://twitter.com/TOILucknow/status/822895619224256521", "https://twitter.com/TOILucknow/status/823325665386786817"], "published": "2017-01-23T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T10:23:41.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
