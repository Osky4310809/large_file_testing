Share it! 464 Shares \nThe holidays have come and gone, and empty nesters are now recovering from the joy of seeing their beloved college-aged children once again. \nFor example, dad Dan Howard, who voiced that joy in a wonderfully sarcastic Facebook video that you'll see below that has gone viral with more than five million views. \nHe broke down each of the five days in glorious fashion. Day One \nDay one was great. \nIt was a work night, and the plane was delayed, so it got in at one in the morning. And then she had the heaviest piece of luggage I’ve ever felt in my life — it must have been 150 lbs — and one of the wheels was broken, so I carried it across the whole airport. \nBut it’s the Christmas season, and we love to have her. Day Two \nShe had friends over — late night. At three in the morning they decided to bake. It was so cute listening to their voices, I probably slept an hour. \nThey left everything out, even the milk — it was sour — those rascals. Day Three \nShe had some more friends over and they were singing that song, “Bye, bye Miss American Pie… ” It’s just very, very catchy that song. I found myself singing it all night. Couldn’t go to work the next day — I was exhausted. Day Four \nShe hasn’t brought her luggage upstairs yet. She’s living out of it in the living room. There are piles of clothes all over her room, so we don’t even go to the gym any more. What we do is jump over the piles and pretend they’re hurdles — very good for the quads. 22 Words Rocks ...AND GETS ALL UP IN YOUR FACEBOOK More posts in #Entertainment", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:58:56.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
