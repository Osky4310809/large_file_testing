There’s a lot of people out there who don’t think that. But we’ll have to wait and see. Let him do his job first. If he can possibly screw it up nearly half as much as Obama, I’ll be surprised. ” \nWhile what he said is funny, it’s also true. Obama did so much to hurt this country that not many people could top him — except perhaps former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \nDitka has criticized Obama before, calling him the worst president this country has ever seen.   \nDitka also weighed in on San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and his national anthem protests, saying that he would have kicked Kaepernick (or any player who protested the anthem) off his team. \nStill hitting as hard as he did in his playing days, Ditka also said that those criticizing New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for not disavowing his friendship with Trump were “a**holes.” Mike Ditka tells us sports journalists who call for #TomBrady to denounce his support of @POTUS are a-holes! @sidrosenberg @BernieMcGuirk \n— Bernie and Sid Show (@bernieandsid) February 2, 2017 \nHe added that there will always be disagreements but that they are part of what makes America great.
