You want to be remembered by winning trophies, at the end of the day.

No disrespect, but you want to remembered as well. \n“You have to think how this club has to grow, how it has to improve, which player does it want to bring in so you can challenge for the big trophies. \n“I don’t know what the board’s plan is, but there were some players I knew the club could have got and they didn’t, and they’re playing in this league. \n\"I am not saying names, but they are doing well.” \nLukaku, is still only 23 and has two years left to run on his current contract. But with the likes of Real Madrid, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United in the running to sign him, there is no chance Everton can keep him. \nHe said: “I look at Luis Suarez, Roberto Lewandowski, Karim Benzema, Edinson Cavani. That’s it. Barcelona star Suarez is one of the few strikers Lukaku feels he can learn from (Photo: Getty) \n\"I’m not looking at the rest. No chance. \n“He [Tottenham's Harry Kane] is a top player and you want to see top players in the league, but I don’t look at other players if they aren’t going to teach me anything. If I don’t have the feeling that you are going to teach me something, why should I look at you? \n“I watch what they do in certain moments and I think, 'That’s interesting.' I’m close to that [level], I’m close. \n\"At the minute, I am one of the best strikers in the league. I can’t NOT say that. If I don’t say I am one of the best I am shooting myself in the head. At the minute I am one of the best in the Premier League, 100 per cent. Lukaku appeared at a Kick it Out event hosted by Everton on Wednesday...

So we need to try more, give a bit more. You should not shy away from it. \n“Like, if you don’t win a trophy there is something that has gone wrong, because if you have the belief that you can do something, you can do it.” \n* Romelu Lukaku is one of Kick It Out’s Next 20 ambassadors and was speaking at a coaching session with Everton in the Community’s girls pan-disability team .
