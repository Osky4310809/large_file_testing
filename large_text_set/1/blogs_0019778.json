Ad Feedback \nThe impact of this apparent profligacy on the economy? \nCritics of raising the minimum wage have long claimed the real victims are the poor, because employers cannot afford to take on new workers. \n\"The Government knows very well that hiking the minimum wage faster than inflation means those most vulnerable are priced out of the job market,\" Taxpayers' Union executive director Jordan Williams said, echoing similar warnings from last year. \nLogic suggests that someone will miss out because some company, somewhere, cannot afford to take on that extra employee. \nThis would apparent in a time of recession (perhaps offset by the fact that lower paid workers, who tend to spend every dollar they earn, have more in their pocket). \nBut in the third quarter of 2016, unemployment fell below 5 per cent for the first time since 2008. \nThe number of hand written signs on shops and restaurants across New Zealand seeking staff this summer is hardly scientific, but it suggests the constraint many companies face is finding workers, not paying them. \nIn previous years, the Government has hinted that the decision to increase was an agonising balance between being generous to tens of thousands of people affected, while not wanting to price workers out of the market. \nBack in early 2015, as he raised the minimum wage to $14.75 an hour, Workplace Relations Minister Michael Woodhouse warned that had the increase been to $15.50, it would \"constrain employment growth\" by 5000 jobs. \nThis year Woodhouse's release contained no such figure, noting instead that another $65 million would be pumped into the economy from the increase. \nPerhaps the research on the looming job losses has not been finalised, or perhaps it shows that the minimum wage could have gone to $16 without making much of an impact after all. \nAs it happens, the latest increase seems destined to pass with almost no one noticing. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T06:40:08.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
