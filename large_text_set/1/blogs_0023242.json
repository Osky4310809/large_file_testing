ET caught up with the \"Ain't Your Mama\" singer in Los Angeles on Thursday, where we asked her about the gorgeous Versace silk chiffon number -- which featured an extremely plunging neckline and dramatic slit -- she wore to the awards show in 2000. Lopez was dating Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs, who went by Puff Daddy at the time, and the two were all smiles while walking the red carpet together.

Like everything started stirring.\" \"It was a weird feeling,\" she continued. \"I was like, 'What's happening?' And my dress was happening and I didn't know it.\" RELATED: Jennifer Lopez Flaunts Her Curves in Behind-the-Scenes Promo Pic for 'World of Dance' Photo: Getty Images Following our interview, Lopez later took to Instagram, still marveling over the dress that landed her a coveted spot on almost every single Best Dressed at the GRAMMYs list 17 years ago. \"Dreams come true...,\" she captioned it. \"#GiuseppexJennifer.\" A photo posted by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Jan 26, 2017 at 10:01pm PST WATCH: Jennifer Lopez on Why She Named a Shoe in Her New Line After Her Daughter: 'She's Soft and Fierce' And the 47-year-old Shades of Blue star is crushing her goals as of late!
