William Lacy Clay (D-MO) has hung up the painting three separate times after numerous Republicans, taking after Rep. Duncan Hunter’s lead, have pulled the painting down from the hall and returned it back to his office.

Rep Clay rehangs controversial pigs/police art for 3rd time today. pic.twitter.com/Rp5C0YU2t6 \n— Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) January 10, 2017 \nAnd with Clay having hung it up for the third time this afternoon, there is currently a gaggle of reporters posted up and ready to capture the moment when another GOPer comes and takes down the painting. Reporters staking out the \"pig cops\" painting. When will someone take it down next?? pic.twitter.com/fnqeu10ny6 \n— Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) January 10, 2017 \nClay bemoaned the “alt-right media sites” and “some Republican members” who refer to themselves as “constitutional conservatives” who don’t support the “fundamental free speech of my 18-year-old constituent.” (The painting was done by a high school student and was chosen as the winner of a contest.) \nMeanwhile, Hunter said the painting was in violation of the Capitol rules and they would “take it down.” \nWatch the news clip of the situation above, via Fox News. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:05:25.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
