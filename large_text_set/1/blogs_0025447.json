Blasphemy! At least according to a mighty bloc of Brits. A petition protesting Trump’s official state visit with the Queen, slated for later this year, has now surpassed 1 million signatures in the U.K. Initially created on the British government’s official petition site in November, the petition provides that “Donald Trump should be allowed to enter the U.K. in his capacity as head of the U.S. Government, but he should not be invited to make an official State Visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.” \nIn other words, Trump meeting with Theresa May and lawmakers could be stomached by the British populace . . . but the notion of him darkening the door of the palace and handling the silver? That’s a bridge too far. As to why the British population might feel this way, Trump in 2012 tweeted his defense of the “stalker-style” photos of the Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing on vacation this way: “Who wouldn’t take Kate [Middleton]’s picture and make lots of money if she does the nude sunbathing thing. Come on Kate!” “Donald Trump’s well-documented misogyny and vulgarity disqualifies him from being received by Her Majesty the Queen or the Prince of Wales,” the petition reads. “Therefore during the term of his presidency Donald Trump should not be invited to the United Kingdom for an official state visit.” \nThe petition gained momentum after Prime Minister May’s diplomatic visit with President Trump in Washington last week—in which the two diplomats were pictured holding hands, which the the Daily Mail reported was due to the latter’s phobia of “stairs and slopes”—and began to earn a reported 1,000 signatures a minute following Trump’s controversial, protest-sparking executive order temporarily banning refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. “Maybe Trump’s travel ban has angered people and they want him to know what it’s like to be banned from a country,” the petition’s creator, lawyer Graham Guest, told CNN . \nBy virtue of earning more than 100,000 signatures, the petition will be considered for debate in Parliament, where lleaders of multiple parties have disapproved of May’s invitation . May herself said of Trump’s immigration order over the weekend: “We do not agree with this kind of approach,” but she will not rescind her invite to Trump, saying she was “ very happy ” to extend it. Should it go forward, here’s one silver lining: environmental advocate Prince Charles may get a long-coveted opportunity to teach the president a thing or two about climate change .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T20:06:17.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
