She's widely believed to have presidential ambitions. \nTweeted @mmatigari: \"[Grace] in Buhera & her million dollar jewellery. She has to try hard to pretend to be humble amongst poor villagers.\" \n\"Just leaving this here,\" said journalist @eliasmambo next to a widely-tweeted photo of Grace with her jewellery circled in red. The photo - minus the red circles - was published by the state-owned Herald online. \nAnother Zimbabwean commented grimly that the first lady, whose husband Robert Mugabe turns 93 next week, was \"in solidarity with the poor\". \nSee the tweets below. \nIn 2014 the Zimbabwean first lady claimed her husband was \"the poorest president in the world\". Though somehow the couple managed to save $1.3m to pay for a diamond ring for her last year. Dr Fugunde in Buhera & her million dollar jewellery.
