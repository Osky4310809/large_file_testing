Gibbs, son of team owner Joe Gibbs, in a very cool way. \nTo honor J.D., Hamlin is putting his name above the driver’s side door of his No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota. Check out the video. \nSince March 2015 J.D. has been undergoing treatment for symptoms impacting areas of brain function that the team said began with speech and processing issues. \nWhen the team made the announcement in 2015, officials said doctors believed the issues were related to previous head injuries J.D. suffered. He played quarterback and defensive back in college. I wanted to do something special for JD who gave me my first shot in @NASCAR We share the same initials so I thought this would be perfect. pic.twitter.com/sH0p9SPmjl \n— Denny Hamlin (@dennyhamlin) February 14, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:17:36.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
