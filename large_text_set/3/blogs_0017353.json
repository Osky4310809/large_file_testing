He finished in a tie for fourth, which was still good enough to return him to No. 2 in the world. Arnold Palmer Invitational: Articles, photos and videos \nAfter a slow start to the week, McIlroy shot 10 under on the weekend when the conditions were firm and fast. \nThough he doesn’t yet have a victory this year, McIlroy has finished inside the top 7 in all three starts. Next week’s WGC-Match Play is his final tournament before Augusta. \n“It’s been good,” he said of his form. “I haven’t had the win that I’ve wanted, but it’s been good, consistent play and that hopefully bodes well for the year ahead.” Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T03:04:57.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
