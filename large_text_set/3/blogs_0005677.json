Michael Cannan was described as the ringleader of the burglars (Photo: Greater Manchester Police) \nDante's mother Lisa Booth, landlady of The Valley pub in Collyhurst, said she \"couldn't be prouder\" of her daughter. \nShe said: \"There were three adults in the house at the time of the burglary and she saved us all from getting hurt.\" \nMichael Cannan, of no fixed address, was given an extended sentence at Manchester Crown Court. \nJailing him for 15 years, and ordering him to serve another five years on licence, Judge Richard Mansell QC described him as \"dangerously out of control\".

Patrick Caffrey was jailed for 14 years for his part in the raid (Photo: Greater Manchester Police) \nThe judge added: “I commend the family, and particularly Dante, whose bravery and maturity ensured that these three men were brought to justice, and that the ordeal was not prolonged.” \nAt the time of the raid family friend Robert Ashton had been visiting for the festive season, while pub landlady Lisa Booth and her partner Carl Malone were upstairs in bed. \nArmed with a machete and a claw-hammer, the gang burst into the house. \nCannan threatened to ‘kill, cut and slice’ Mr Ashton, before barging upstairs and swinging the machete at Ms Booth and Mr Malone. \nThey ordered the couple to lie face down and ransacked the place, before fleeing empty handed through windows as police arrived.

Dean Richardson was sentenced to 13 years (Photo: Greater Manchester Police) \n\"It was lucky she wasn’t asleep, because she would have slept through the whole thing. \n“It was Carl who first alerted me, he said ‘what’s that noise?’ We went out to look on the landing and we were faced with two masked men with a machete. Dante heard me screaming and phoned the police. \n\"She didn’t know what was going on, but must have heard me shouting, ‘I’ve got a kid, I’ve got a kid!’ \n\"The men forced us back in the bedroom, telling us to lie on the bed. I didn’t, because I didn’t know if they’d come to rape me. \n\"Dante must have come out of her bedroom, because we came out onto the landing and Cannan had her on the stairs with the machete to her throat. \n\"It was sheer hell to see that happen to your daughter, who is innocent, it’s something that will live with me forever. The raid took place at The Valley pub in Collyhurst (Photo: Google) \n“She put her hand out and I saw blood. I picked up a vase to hit him with. He tried to force us back into the bedroom, and Dante escaped down the stairs. \n\"She opened the door and armed police were just downstairs, and she let them in.” \nLisa knew all three of the gang from the local area, and she believes they broke in believing her and Dante would be in the house alone with the pub’s New Year takings. \n“It was like something out of a film, and when it was being read out in court it still didn’t feel like it was really happening”, Lisa added. \n“I actually felt a bit sorry for them sat there in the dock, but I quickly my changed my mind. They all looked pathetic without their masks and weapons, and I thought ‘you had me vulnerable in the bedroom, with your machete, now you’re vulnerable.’ \n\"The police were great and I’m very happy with the sentences. But I’m so proud of Dante. Even the judge said it was all through Dante. It could have been a lot worse. It could have been a massacre.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T13:42:08.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
