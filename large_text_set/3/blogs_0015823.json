I can say that. https://t.co/fMDgiKPDDT\nâ€” Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) March 18, 2017\n. @joshtpm don't you have some porn to tweet out?\nâ€” Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) March 18, 2017\nBut Marshall was having none of it and shot back at Spencer calling him a \"chump\" and a \"punk.\"\nTake your trash philosophy back to the 1930s, chump. You're just a punk. https://t.co/VTkcuPmlPO\nâ€” Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) March 18, 2017\nSpencer's reply cited and included a clip of the song \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" from the film version of Cabaret , a 1972 film (based on the Broadway musical of the same name) about a group of singers at a Berlin club in the early 1930s, just as the Nazis are beginning their rise to power.\n. @joshtpm 1930s? No, tomorrow belongs to us. https://t.co/gpmWYIITr4\nâ€” Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) March 18, 2017\nWatch the video for \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me,\" which was so spot on it has been mistaken in the past for an actual Nazi anthem, per Uproxx , and you'll understand why the song may be popular to people like Spencer. It's even been covered by white power bands in the past.\nFollowing the video tweet, one more person jumped in to clap back at Spencer. CNN contributor Jason Kander, whose uncle John Kander wrote the song for the original Broadway musical version of Cabaret, sent the burn to end all burns.\nHey buddy, that song you love was written by my uncle. He's been married to my other uncle for 40 years. And he's a Jew.\nSing it proud. https://t.co/yrL4242sl5\nâ€” Jason Kander (@JasonKander) March 18, 2017\nThe hot fire exchange led to Jason Kander being on CNN on Monday morning, talking about the spat, his uncle, and the history of the song. \"It's not every day you get to tell off a neo-Nazi,\" Kander said, \"so it seemed like a fun thing to do over the weekend.\"\n\"Cabaret\" song leads to heated Twitter exchange https://t.co/rkoiiIZaaU\nâ€” New Day (@NewDay) March 20, 2017\nFor his part, Spencer moved on to other topics and Twitter beefs while we're left figuring out how a song from a Liza Minnelli film became a cultural touchstone for the cultural battle with the alt-right.\nJust another day in Trump's America.\nWATCH: 'Homeland' star had to master Whatsapp to reconnect with refugee family he rescued", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer/status/843213184689291264", "http://www.counter-currents.com/2011/11/tomorrow-belongs-to-me/", "https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/843212645117415424", "https://t.co/rkoiiIZaaU", "https://twitter.com/JasonKander/status/843227257061761024", "https://twitter.com/NewDay/status/843793404316278784", "https://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer/status/843216482838355968", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/QaEojUtj.jpg", "https://t.co/gpmWYIITr4", "https://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer/status/843189633160691712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/yrL4242sl5", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/QaEojUtj.m3u8", "https://t.co/VTkcuPmlPO", "http://www.mediaite.com/online/tpms-josh-marshall-tweets-out-porno-link-to-shock-of-political-media-world/", "http://uproxx.com/webculture/richard-spencer-cabaret-tweet-composer/2/", "https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/843215023027748864", "https://books.google.com/books?id=RqwABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=The+accusations+against+%E2%80%9CTomorrow+Belongs+to+Me%E2%80%9D+made+me+very+angry&source=bl&ots=VdBjohOmZS&sig=K3Z5jXIzQx28FnXowK8Z7wo4f6c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiK9MWa--PSAhWpzIMKHU57BrAQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=The%20accusations%20against%20%E2%80%9CTomorrow%20Belongs%20to%20Me%E2%80%9D%20made%20me%20very%20angry&f=false", "https://twitter.com/joshtpm", "https://t.co/fMDgiKPDDT"], "published": "2017-03-20T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:52:06.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
