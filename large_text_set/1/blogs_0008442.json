DeMille Award at the Golden Globes, in which he called her “a joke.” \n— Tony Siragusa (@TonySiragusa) January 9, 2017 \nSiragusa’s comments come in reaction to Streep’s apparent jab at the NFL. In her speech, the actress expressed the importance of the role of minorities in Hollywood saying, “If we kick them all out, you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.” \nSiragusa, who played in the NFL for 13 years, clearly took offense to Streep’s sentiments and was not afraid to hide his feelings. \nYou can listen to Streep’s full speech in the video below: \nThumbnail photo via Joe Camporeale/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T16:31:12.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
