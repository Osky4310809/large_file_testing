He got it a couple of days before so it was an easy gift. Some of the lads and staff at Carrington were laughing about it—he's not shy of a wind-up or two\". Francois Mori/Associated Press \nIbrahimovic has had no trouble finding his feet in the Premier League and has struck 13 times for United so far this season. \nThe 35-year-old recently admitted he relished the chance to defy his critics in England. He said, per Jamie Jackson of the Guardian : \"I don't know how many years I have left but I am enjoying the football. I came to the Premier League and everyone thought it would not be possible but like always I make them eat their balls.\" \nAnd in true Ibrahimovic style, it's probably wise not to rule out wife Helena receiving more framed pictures in the future if he continues to hit the goal trail at Old Trafford .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T14:37:06.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
