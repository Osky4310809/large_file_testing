Michael Hebb in Peabody District Court Tuesday. (WBZ-TV) \nMichael Hebb, 45 of Peabody, was charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Mark Greenlaw, 37, and Jennifer O’Connor, 40. He was ordered held without bail. \nHebb was arrested without incident at a Peabody housing complex Monday afternoon. \nOn Tuesday afternoon, an arrest warrant was issued for a second suspect in the murders, Wes Doughty , who is considered to be armed and dangerous.

Peabody murder victims Mark Greenlaw and Jennifer O’Connor (WBZ) \nBecause this is an active investigation, defense attorney Ray Buso couldn’t say much to reporters–but he did answer a question about whether or not Hebb acted in self-defense. \n“I’m sure there’s a big story behind here, given what I know, but it’s not ready yet,” Buso said. \n“Clearly there’s a lot more than what’s been reported in the last 48 hours in the press,” Buso added. \nBuso said he wasn’t designated as Hebb’s attorney until after the suspect talked to police for almost two hours. \n“I can tell you he gave a recorded statement after he was arrested yesterday about his involvement and other people’s,” Buso said. \nCourt records indicated that Hebb and the two victims all had criminal histories. \nJennifer’s father, Ed O’Connor, told WBZ that his daughter suffered many medical problems throughout her life, and says that all the medication she was prescribed led her to drugs, alcohol and acquaintances with the wrong people. \n“She was my daughter, we did what we had to do, and it just wasn’t enough,” he said. Jennifer O’Connor (WBZ-TV) \nAt age 5, Jennifer was diagnosed with leukemia. At 15, she had a stroke, and 10 years ago, she was in a coma for weeks because of a flesh-eating bacteria. \n“Because of all the issues Jen has had, we have mourned her several times, so it’s just a continuation of the mourning process,” said Ed. “It’s been tough, it’s really been tough.” \nOne of Mark Greenlaw’s family members attended the arraignment. She told WBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Kim Tunnicliffe she was still in shock. \n“Disbelief … this is a very bad thing for somebody to do to somebody,” she said. \nAuthorities were alerted to the gruesome scene of O’Connnor and Greenlaw’s murders Saturday night, after a woman who ran from the house flagged down a driver and reported the murders to Massachusetts State Police.

Sources told WBZ-TV that there were body parts at the scene, but investigators said only that they were awaiting a report from the medical examiner’s office. \nEssex District Attorney Jon Blodgett said the home was known to police. \nWBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Kim Tunnicliffe reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:36:41.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
