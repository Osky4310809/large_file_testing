Sambueza, the most-carded player in the Liga MX Apertura, left Las Aguilas to join Toluca this offseason after the club made it clear its captain didn't have a future in the capital. \n\"It would've been great to leave in another way,\" Sambueza said at the Mexico City airport, where he arrived Thursday morning from vacation in his native Argentina. \"I have nothing against America, only gratefulness for the time I had there. They've always treated me really well.\" \nThe 33-year-old now begins a new stage, joining a Toluca team looking to reload after missing the postseason in the Apertura. Sambueza joins the likes of Gabriel Hauche, formerly of Tijuana, and former Leon defender Efrain Velarde as reinforcements for coach Hernan Cristante's side. \n\"Toluca is opening the doors of its house to me. I'm coming to a great club, there's a great squad,\" he said. \"I want to get there as soon as possible to meet them all personally and be available to them.\" \nAnd, in an interesting coincidence, Toluca will be celebrating its 100th anniversary. Part of the angst about America's title defeat was the fact that it came during Las Aguilas' 100th year as a club. \n\"I'm going to another big team, and lucky to be able to go through another centenario,\" said Sambueza, who is suspended for Toluca's opening match Sunday against Atlas because of his expulsion from the final.
