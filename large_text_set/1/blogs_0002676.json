I know this happened over the long vacation week but just had to weigh in real quick. Nick Saban is perfect. Just the perfect college football coach. I mean did Lane Kiffin do anything wrong, taking a better job somewhere that was a better opportunity and getting himself as a head coach? Of course not. Think Saban gives a fuck? All he knows is Kiffin’s leaving him. He’s leaving Alabama. He wasn’t forced out, it wasn’t Saban’s call. He voluntarily left on his own accord. And you just simply do not do that to Nick fucking Saban. \nAnd now he can’t coach in the National Championship game. Sorry, bro. If you wanted to be on the sideline with the team you helped to get there you should have reconsidered crossing Nick Saban dumbass. \nLane can just add it to his increasingly large list of getting publicly cucked.
