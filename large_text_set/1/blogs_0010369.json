The two motormouths that they are, we expected it to be, as KJo says “full of fire”, but sadly we were disappointed. And as much as as we wanted it to be rapid, it wasn’t thanks to the absent of much expected sass and an overdose of poise. The only good thing about the whole telecast was the promo of the next episode, which features Priyanka Chopra . Yep, this episode, which was taped very recently when Priyanka was in India will be aired next Sunday and we definitely cannot contain our excitement. Although Priyanka won’t share the couch with anyone, but we bet the episode is going to be an entertaining ride. \nThe promo starts with PC making revelations on her relationship status and moves on to talk about about being approached by guys in New York. On asking about her relationship status she says, “I believe you are single till you are married!”. Well that might be a risky approach in many instances. Talking about how different men are with their approach in India and in the West, the actress says, “The boys here are a little cautious. There it’s straight up –“I am free tomorrow, I am in New York. Let’s go for dinner.” Na Jaan na pehchaan. Akele! Itni forward nahi hoon main!”. And we totally love the laugh she carried while answering this. From talks of marriage to shots of Koffee, @priyankachopra will be on the couch getting 'personal' with @karanjohar ! #KoffeeWithKaran pic.twitter.com/YBJVVtN7ks \n— Star World (@StarWorldIndia) January 15, 2017 \nThe Koffee Quiz also gets a very different twist this time. The set up somewhat resembles the one on The Ellen DeGeneres Show’s Five Second Rule. Karan asks Priyanka to “name three Mughal emperors” to which she replied “Arre baba!” Then Karan asks her to “name three Maratha warriors” to which she replies by simply laughing. We hope Priyanka doesn’t have a Alia Bhatt like moment.

Priyanka will be asked questions of all sorts –“kissed an ex after break-up?” and “ever been cheated on?”. Lets see how she answers the questions! \nPriyanka recently suffered a concussion on the sets of Quantico, after which she was sent to the emergency room. Today, she tweeted about recovering health rapidly, and that she will resume shooting scene.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T21:09:46.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
