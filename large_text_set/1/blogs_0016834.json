Woodford said the gathering was about “helping and supporting each other.” Happening now in #brussels the #lights4rights during #TrumpInauguration #InaugurationDay @LaMonnaieDeMunt… https://t.co/cJzE1zEeJY\n— Brussels Express (@ExpressBrussels) “Obviously we were all outraged at the election results, so this is the result of our energy from that outrage,” Woodford told BuzzFeed News by phone the day before the march. “Our key concern as Europeans is what impact Trump’s presidency would have, and how it [may] empower people on the far right who haven’t had a voice before to come out of the closet, if you like.”\nID: 10362725 4.

And then — he was.”\nBut Woodford said the march deliberately had no policy or political aim, beyond fighting “the rise of the far right. Within that spectrum, from far right to left, everyone is pretty much represented, and we don’t have any political backing or support,” she said.\nID: 10363716 6. Some marchers were drawn to the square to stand up for reproductive rights, including access to abortion and post-abortion care. Solidarité avec les femmes du monde entier! #womensmarch #lights4rights #womensrights\n— IPPF Europe (@ippfen) “When you have more conservative agendas coming in, the first line of attack is often a woman’s body,” said Caroline Hickson, the regional director of International Planned Parenthood Federation’s European Network. “We want to draw attention to threat in Europe of rollback of women’s rights, particularly reproductive rights.”\nID: 10364730 7. For other women, the choice to march was difficult. “There are women sitting this one out because of abortion,” a woman named Meredith wrote to BuzzFeed News in an email. “There are women sitting this one out because they don’t feel solidarity across the racial divide. #lights4rights #womensmarch in #brussels has started\n— Lavinia Talenti (@TaleLavi) Meredith’s views on abortion are shaped by her Christian faith and “go against the grain of progressive feminism,” she wrote in advance of the march. Ultimately, her faith is also the reason she decided, in the end, to go.\n“I believe we are all made in the image of God, and are sacred because of it. Trump is anathema to this concept and I cannot simply stand by and normalize his rise to power,” she wrote. “I just think it’s important that the world knows that there are women of faith (many different ones), who struggled with the decision to attend, but who are still showing up to show solidarity for the causes they think are most important….\n“I cannot justify sitting this one out. It is too big. So while I acknowledge our brokenness as we move forward, and that there are intergroup obstacles that need to be addressed: I will be there,” she wrote.\nID: 10362732 8.

Brussels was the first of more than 600 marches planned across the US and around the world in solidarity with the Women’s March in Washington, DC, on Saturday.

They have problems. They want their rights to get improved … so we think we have some kind of mutual objectives and goals.”\nID: 10365140 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!\nJina Moore is the international women's rights correspondent for BuzzFeed News and is based in Nairobi.
