The video takes intimacy to new levels, with a host of couples fully going at it with each other on buses, cars and in offices as Future and Ariana sing along while observing all the action. It provides for some hilarious reactions from those watching on within the video, as you can watch above.\nFuture has stayed ridiculously proactive of late, having dropped two albums in the space of a week and starring in several other ridiculous videos, such as “Draco,” which you can watch below.\n\nIn other music news, Lil Uzi Vert has dropped four new tracks, which you can listen to here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:47:47.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
