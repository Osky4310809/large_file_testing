By Rajat Tripathi | Updated: March 31, 2017 12:04 am Akshay Kumar, Karan Johar, Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt launch Twinkle Khanna's The Legend Of Laxmi Prasad \nWhat started with a blog post, might be the end of TVF as we used to know it. Days after the blog post accusing the TVF CEO Arunabh Kumar of molestation became viral, two FIRs have been lodged against him. After the news of first FIR filed yesterday surfaced, one more woman head to Versova police station to register her complaint. Both the FIRs allege sexual harassment. \nAccording to reports, the woman alleges that she was molested by Arunabh Kumar, when she was called by him for an interview at his Versova office. “The woman was molested inside the cabin by Arunabh Kumar. She immediately left from his cabin and later never met him. We have registered FIR under section 354 of IPC,” a India Today quoted the police. \nAfter the first anonymous blog post, multiple women had posted about facing sexual harassment by Arunabh. All the posts went viral on the internet. All the people questioning the women that why they were ranting on social media instead of taking an action, these two FIR should be your answer. \nArunabh and TVF have been receiving immense backlash from the industry. While Raveena Tandon pulled out from any promotional activities planned for her film Maatr on TVF, Twinkle Khanna critically wrote about them in a column. Taapsee Pannu, who has a few friends at TVF, has also expressed her anger over the entire matter and hoped that truth will prevail. Also Read: Twinkle Khanna took on TVF CEO Arunabh Kumar by calling him a FROG and we can’t agree more \nBack when the controversy had only begun to rise, TVF denied all the allegations and said it would “leave no stone unturned to find the author of the article and bring them to severe justice for making such false allegations.” We wonder what is TVF’s take on the topic now. \nAn unpopular theory doing the rounds on Twitter suggests that this is all a well planned marketing stunt by TVF, to coincide with their upcoming show Bisht Please. We hope not!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:30:12.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
