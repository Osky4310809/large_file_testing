Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images As protesting Americans are left confused, angry and frustrated over President Trump’s new restrictive immigration policies, many in Chicago’s restaurant community are also rallying. Some have provided food for busy and tired volunteer lawyers who are waiting to represent affected travelers at airports. Others are hosting events to raise money for charities. Over at O’Hare International Airport, where volunteer lawyers aided travelers adversely affected by Trump’s executive order, One Off Hospitality Group and Paul Kahan’s Publican Tavern at the airport provided attorneys with lunch as they continued to assist. Chicagoist picked up the news. Thanks to @publicanchicago for bringing out lunch for @ORDLawyersHQ ! Delicious and much appreciated! Dark Matter Coffee, Metropolis Coffee and Goddess & The Grocer also chipped in and donated food and drink. @ORDLawyersHQ We'll aim for 6pm because no human being is illegal. — Metropolis Coffee (@MtropolisCoffee) January 30, 2017 As attorneys monitor the situation over at O’Hare, restaurants have started to organize charity events in Chicago to help those affected. From 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 23, 10 percent of net sales from in-house orders at Roots Homemade Pizza’s locations in Ukrainian Village and Lincoln Square will benefit RefugeeOne . Much of Trump’s Muslim ban is focused on Syria, with many Syrians seeking asylum in other countries after a five-year war that’s devastated their homes. A collection of restaurants—Aloha Poke Co., Honey’s, Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, El Hefe, Black Iron Tavern, Bottled Blonde, and Fulton Market Kitchen—are coming together for “Hearts For Aleppo” on Monday, Feb. 13 at Fulton Market Kitchen, 311 N. Sangamon St. Money from the event will benefit UNICEF’s efforts in the Syrian city of Aleppo, bringing clean water and other basic needs to the region. Click here for tickets . Others are donating money. Kevin Boehm from the Boka Group announced his allegiance to the ACLU via Instagram.
