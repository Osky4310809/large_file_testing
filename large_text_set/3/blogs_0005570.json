All we’re saying is let’s take a closer look. Let’s look into this. If this happened, if this is accurate, this is the biggest overreach. Sarah Huckabee Sanders: \"I'll let the President speak for himself. \nMartha Raddatz: \"But you're his spokesperson!?\" \n— Michael LaRosa (@MichaelLaRosaDC) March 5, 2017 \n\n“If! If! If! if! If!” Raddatz exclaims, clearly exasperated. “Why is the president saying it did happen?” \n“I think he is going off information he’s seen that has led him to believe that this is a very real potential,” Sanders says. “The American people have a right to know if this took place.” \n“The president believes it is true?” Raddatz emphasizes, reminding Sanders that Trump said the wiretapping was a “fact.” after again explaining that Trump had called the wiretapping claim a “fact.” \nRelated: Why does alt-right darling Tomi Lahren’s Facebook profile link to an adult film site? \n“His tweet speaks for itself,” says Sanders. “He’s talking about… could this have happened?” \n“He’s saying — once again, he said it did happen,” Raddatz replies. \nSander’s barely coherent counterpoint: \n“All we’re asking is we get the same level of look into the Obama administration and the potential that they had for a complete abuse of power that they’ve been claiming that we’ve done over the last six months. And time and time again, there’s no evidence or wrongdoing. The FBI says this is B.S. Yes, you guys continue to hammer and hammer of some false idea and false narrative that there’s something there when, frankly, there just isn’t.” \nArchly, the ABC host retorts, ““I just want to say Donald Trump started this on Saturday morning.” \nWatch the video below: \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T18:18:21.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
