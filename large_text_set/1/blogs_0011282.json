Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJurgen Klopp was irked by Manchester United's long-ball tactics as Liverpool had victory snatched away towards the end of a \"wild\" north-west derby. \nSunday's Premier League clash at Old Trafford could not have been more different to October's drab 0-0 draw at Anfield in terms of entertainment and energy. \nJames Milner put the visitors ahead by coolly converting a first-half penalty after Paul Pogba, whose Twitter hashtag was advertised around the pitch, handled a corner in the box. \nHowever, the world's most expensive player's blushes were spared by fellow big-name summer acquisition Zlatan Ibrahimovic heading home six minutes from time to secure a 1-1 draw. \nKlopp was naturally frustrated to have conceded a late equaliser, which the Liverpool boss believes was born of United's direct style that ended up with the ball spending \"25 minutes in the air\".

We created the spaces we wanted, we scored the goal. \n\"In the end period of the game when United started playing long balls - [to] Marouane Fellaini and Zlatan Ibrahimovic - after 80 minutes (of) high intense football, it is really hard. \n\"I hoped we would have a bit of luck. Unfortunately not, but all good. \n\"[On Monday] I can enjoy the result, but [on Sunday night] only the performance. Liverpool's James Milner celebrates scoring the opening goal (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \n\"It is so intense. They play long balls, it was a wild game. There was a lot of action in the last few minutes. \n\"We were here to win the game, which is why we are not 100 per cent satisfied.\" \nKlopp and opposite number Jose Mourinho clashed towards the end of the match, with fourth official Craig Pawson coming between them after an incident involving Roberto Firmino and Ander Herrera. \nLiverpool forward Firmino was booked for shoving United midfielder Herrera in response to having his shirt pulled in stoppage time. \nBoth managers downplayed the issue, with Mourinho saying: \"He [Klopp] thought I was asking for his player to be sent off. I wasn't. There was no problem at all.\" Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores the equaliser (Photo: Getty Images) \nKlopp added: \"He [Mourinho] wanted the minimum of a yellow card.\" \nLike Klopp, Ibrahimovic was not wholly satisfied with the result, despite United coming back to earn a point. \nThe Swede bemoaned \"simple mistakes\", admitting a more direct style was key for Mourinho's team. \n\"We get one point, but we were not on the top of our game,\" Ibrahimovic told Sky Sports. \n\"It was a hard fight. We were 1-0 down and we chased and, at the end, we got the equaliser. \n\"We did simple mistakes. We were not feeling comfortable under the pressure of the opponent and I think we played the wrong way.
