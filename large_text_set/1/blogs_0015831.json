The latter was said to be in the so-called blue book of the late Albuera mayor Rolando Espinosa, as protector of the drug trade in the province. \nIn a speech he delivered in Davao City last Saturday, Duterte said he would ask the governors to use their powers to curb the proliferation of illegal drugs in their respective provinces. \n“I’d be calling the governors next week. I’d really tell them ‘you tell your barangay captains, you have supervisory powers cities under you, those that are not yet charter cities, you tell the mayors,’” the President said.   \nDuterte had also threatened with death politicians found protecting or conniving with drug lords. He said he would have them ambushed or poisoned if they don’t resign. \nHe said his brutal crackdown on drug lords and the officials protecting them would continue even if he goes down in history as a butcher. \nDuterte reportedly badmouthed mayors with suspected links to illegal drugs during their meeting at Malacañang last Jan. 11. \nThe President later confirmed cursing local executives with suspected drug links during the closed-door meeting. \nEarlier, the Chief Executive said about 2,000 barangay captains, municipal mayors, a few governors and congressmen and some judges were in his new drug list. \nDuterte has so far disclosed the names of about 160 incumbent and former government officials, including judges and uniformed men, believed to be involved in illegal drugs. \nHe has given the House of Representatives, Senate and the Supreme Court copies of the list, admitting that he cannot solve the problem by himself. \nHernandez of Laguna, through spokesman Chris Sanji, said he has instructed local officials to step up their information campaign against illegal drugs. The governor was among the officials who led the unveiling of a drug rehab center last Saturday. Iloilo’s Defensor said he has not been told of the agenda of the meeting but surmised it would be about illegal drugs. – With Cet Dematera, Jennifer Rendon, Michelle Zoleta, Lalaine Jimenea, Roel Pareño, John Unson, Celso Amo, Ed Amoroso", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T03:19:07.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
