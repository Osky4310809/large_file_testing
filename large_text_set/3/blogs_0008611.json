The Attorney General has now asked the remaining 46 presidentially appointed U.S. Attorneys to tender their resignations in order to ensure a uniform transition,” she said in the statement.\n“Until the new U.S. Attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. Attorney’s Offices will continue the great work of the Department in investigating, prosecuting, and deterring the most violent offenders,” she added.\n\nThe Justice Department would not confirm whether this meant that all 46 were being asked to resign effective immediately — although at least one US attorney said so.\nIn a statement, the US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Robert Capers, said, “This afternoon, I was instructed to resign my position as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, effective March 10, 2017.”\n\nThe offices of two high-profile US attorneys — Dana Boente, who is responsible for overseeing any Justice Department investigations into the 2016 presidential campaign, and Preet Bharara, who oversees federal prosecutions out of Manhattan and had been reportedly asked to stay on by President Trump — did not confirm their ouster, although they appear to be included in the order.\nMatthew Miller, a former spokesperson for the Justice Department at the start of the Obama administration, said they handled things differently.\n\n“U.S. attorneys were generally allowed to stay until a replacement was nominated and confirmed by the Senate. Some chose to resign immediately, and some stayed for months or even years,” he told BuzzFeed News. “For example, George Holding in North Carolina stayed on for more than two years, until he indicted John Edwards and then used that as a platform for getting elected to Congress. Rod Rosenstein, of course, stayed for all eight years.”\nSimilar delays occurred in other administrations, as detailed in a Los Angeles Times story surrounding controversy raised over firings of US attorneys in the George W. Bush-era Justice Department\n\nThere are 94 US attorney’s offices across the country, one for each federal judicial district. Nineteen of the offices had an acting US attorney overseeing the office as of March 6, according to a Justice Department website. The remaining 28 are serving either under appointment from the attorney general or by court order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:43:34.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
