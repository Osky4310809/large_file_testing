According to Faraday Future, that the FF 91 is powered by four electric motors drawing from a 130 kWh battery pack, with a claimed range of over 700 km (NEDC estimate). \nFrom that, the FF 91 produces 1,050 hp and 1,800 Nm of torque for a 0-96 km/h (60 mph) time of 2.39 seconds, a claim that places the FF 91 ahead of the Tesla Model S P100D in terms of acceleration. The fastest Tesla is claimed to reach the same acceleration benchmark in 2.5 seconds. \nThe FF 91 will be the first production vehicle to feature retractable 3D lidar, as part of a complex sensor suite which includes 10 high-definition cameras, 13 long- and short-range radars and 12 ultrasonic sensors. Inside, the rear view mirror has been replaced by a high-definition display which merges a live feed from the side mirrors into a single, seamless image, which the company says will virtually eliminate blind spots. \nArrival Interface is FF parlance for facial recognition technology which allows drivers and passengers to unlock the FF 91 without a key, thanks to a camera in the B-pillar which identifies the user’s face. \nCameras on the interior also use facial recognition to automatically adjust interior settings to individual preferences, such as detecting facial expressions and moods to prompt matching music, cabin temperature, seat massage and even scent. \nInside, the FF 91 is claimed to have “industry leading rear-seat reclining angles,” whilst the seats also offer massage, heating, and ventilation for cooling. The FF 91’s panoramic roof, rear and side windows feature smart dimming glass technology courtesy of PDLC (polymer dispersed liquid crystal) glass, which allows users to dim the window panels for privacy by just tapping on the glass. \nAmong its autonomous features is Driverless Valet, which, as the name suggests, enables the FF 91 to park itself after its driver has disembarked from the vehicle, via the FFCTRL mobile app. With the app, drivers can also summon the vehicle from its parking space or schedule a pick-up from a selected time and location. \nThe company says it will be accepting orders for the FF 91 via its new website, and customers who place the first 300 orders will be given the opportunity to upgrade to the Alliance Edition, an exclusive launch series in March. \nA portion of the sales proceeds for each Alliance Edition sold will be donated towards an environmental fund which, FF says, closely aligns with its own sustainability efforts. Production of the FF 91 is planned for commencement in 2018.
