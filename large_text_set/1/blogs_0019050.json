She wants it. She might not ask you to go down on her, because she doesn’t want to seem needy or bossy. But she definitely wants it. Every woman does.\n2. It will raise her confidence. She might feel self-conscious about her vagina right now. But she’ll stop being so insecure if you make oral a habit. The more you do it, the more she’ll get used to it. And the more she gets used to it — the more relaxed she is — the faster she’ll orgasm in the future.\n3. It will encourage her to give oral. The more you give, the more you get. If you’re a gentleman and go down on her before she even asks, she’s eventually going to repay you by getting on her knees and returning the favor.\n4. It will make you look good. Unfortunately for women, there are guys out there that refuse to go down on their girlfriends. Fortunately for you, they make guys like you look fantastic. She’ll be bragging to all of her friends about those multiple orgasms you’ve been giving her.\n5. She’ll be horny more often. If she never gets off after having sex with you, she won’t want to have sex with you. But if she knows she’s going to get an orgasm too, then she’ll be horny a lot more.\n6. Practice makes perfect. As long as you pay attention to her breathing and her moans, you’ll be able to figure out what she likes. Eating a girl out might seem complicated, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll have her worshiping your tongue.\n7. She deserves it. Think of all the times she’s sucked you off during her period. It’s about time you repay her. And even if she hasn’t given all that many blowjobs, she does ride you. She does shave for you. She does do a lot for you.\n8. It’ll make you feel sexier. You know what’s hot? Realizing you have the power to cause an orgasm. To make a beautiful woman squirm and squeal. Not only will she feel better after you go down on her, but you will, too.\n9. You shouldn’t have all the fun . It’s not fair for you to get all of the orgasms while she’s left unfulfilled. Since most women have a hard time getting off with penetration alone, you should get in between her legs and give her clit a little attention.\n10. She’s your girlfriend. You love her. You should want to go down on her. You should want to make her happy. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T06:03:14.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
