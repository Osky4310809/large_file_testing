He explains that he killed George Washington, and that they need to fight the 'rebellion' of American soldiers, and hands them all rifles. \nThawne talks to Rip. Their plan is that the time aberration of killing Washington will lead the Legends to him, and then he kills the team and steals the Spear of Destiny piece for Thawne. \nOn the Waverider, Sara and Jax learn about the time aberration from Gideon. Ray confronts Mick, saying that he thinks there's a rat on the ship that was caused by Mick's mess. \nNate and Amaya talk about getting used to life on the Waverider, and how they wish they had time to be outside. They feel a timequake that pushes them two together. \nGideon informs the group about the aberration of Washington's death. Nate explains the impact that aberration will have on history, and Sara reluctantly agrees to help fix history - but that they need to be careful when traveling there. Sara assigns the team their roles on the mission. \nA fancy party occurs in a mansion in 1776 Pennsylvania. Sara, Nate, Amaya, Mick, and Ray (shrunken down and positioned on the top of Mick's hat). They mingle at the party, and Sara accidentally runs into George Washington. \nStein and Jax tell Sara they need to get Washington out of the party. Redcoats arrive at the party, and the team fights them off while Sara escapes with Washington. \nOutside the mansion, Rip sets off a lantern that shuts off all electricity in the area, including Ray's suit and the Waverider. \nMick and Sara leave the house with Washington, but run into Rip and his men. Rip shoots Sara and leaves her bleeding and alone in the snow. \nSara, Jax, and Stein take Sara into the Waverider's med bay. Jax suggests merging into Firestorm to turn the ship back on, but they aren't able to merge. Sara tells Jax that Rip was the one to shoot him. Sara puts Jax in charge of the mission and passes out. Jax remarks that he doesn't know how to be a captain, but Stein believes he can. \nJax find Nate and Amaya in the Waverider and tells them they need to go out and find Washington to save the mission. \nMick and Washington walk with the Redcoats, both of them stuck in handcuffs. Washington suggests a prisoner trade, but Mick thinks its stupid. \nNate and Amaya follow Mick's trail of snack wrappers in the snow. The two bond over their experiences watching Wizard of Oz, and briefly touch on Amaya's life before dating Rex Tyler. \nJax, Ray, and Stein hear a loud noise outside the Waverider. It's Rip and his men, trying to manually pry open the ship. \nNate and Amaya continue to talk about dating. They hear a loud noise and are led to the edge of a river. They are attacked by two men, but Amaya and Nate fight them off. Nate is pushed into the river, and Amaya harnesses her totem's powers to jump in after him. \nNate and Amaya, now out of the water, find a nearby tent. Nate starts to develop hypothermia, but Amaya begins to undress so she can give him her warmth. \nStein, surrounded by candles, begins to operate on Sara. Ray roams around the air duct of the ship. Jax builds a smoke bomb near the entrance of the Waverider. Rip and his men enter the Waverider and several of them pass out from the smoke. Rip searches for the Spear of Destiny inside the captain's quarters, but can't find it. He realizes that Jax is the one fighting back against Rip's men, and Rip hunts around for him. \nThe Redcoats lead Washington and Mick to General Cornwallis, the leader of the British Army. He tells Washington and Mick that they will be killed for treason in the morning. Washington negotiates a lighter sentence for Mick. \nNate wakes up and asks where his clothes are. Amaya says that they'll wait until the clothes are done drying and then they'll find Washington. Nate suggests she stay inside the tent with him, and the two begin to make out. \nJax continues to outrun Rip in the Waverider. Jax questions why Rip became a traitor against the Legends. Rip suggests that if they get the Spear of Destiny, they could rewrite history and bring Jax's father back to life. Jax says no, and Rip shoots him. \nMick and Washington sit inside a tent. Mick tries to find an easy way for them to escape, but Washington would rather die nobly. He gives Mick a love letter to give to his wife, Martha. \nNate and Amaya wake up. Nate suggests they have sex again, but Amaya says they need to save Washington and Mick. \nJax outruns Rip in the weapon room and eventually tells him he knows where the Spear of Destiny is. \nRay, still Atom-sized, runs into a large rat in the rafters. \nJax leads Rip to the Captains Quarters, but sets off a smoke bomb to escape. Rip spots Jax's trail of blood and begins to follow it. \nSara wakes up from Stein's makeshift surgery. Rip interrupts them and begins to choke Sara. Jax arrives and Rip points his gun at him. He asks Jax to hell him where the Spear is, and Jax tells him it's inside Rip's telescope. Jax reminds Rip that he's about to kill Sara, and Rip doesn't acknowledge her name. He crushes her throat and runs away. Jax runs to her side. \nRip looks inside the telescope for the Spear of Destiny. \nStein wakes up and Jax explains what happened to Sara. Stein asks Ray - wherever he is inside the ship - to turn on the main power. \nRay outruns the giant rat and finds the power for the Waverider. He turns it on. Gideon powers on and begins to repair Sara's fatal injuries. \nWashington is about to be executed, but Rory swoops in and fights the other redcoats. Washington, Nate, and Amaya join in, and the four run as soon as the redcoats are defeated. \nJax runs after Rip and points a gun at him. Rip goes along with it, but Jax doesn't shoot him. Sara shows up and tries to reason with both of them. Jax listens to her and lowers the gun, and Rip walks away to the nearby British troops. \nWashington and Mick toast a drink to their victory. Nate and Amaya arrive with the guns the British had been given by Rip. Mick gives Washington his love letter back, and Washington reveals it was really battle plans. \nSara asks Gideon if history has been restored, and she reports that it is - except there's now a statue of Mick in the US capitol. Jax comes in, and the pair discuss what it means to be a captain. \nThe group throw a Christmas party in the dining room. Ray gives Mick the rat that was in the ducts as a pet. Nate and Amaya discuss their relationship, and Amaya prefers they keep it casual. Nate gives her a gift, which ends up being ruby red shoes like in The Wizard of Oz. The pair smile. \nSara gives a toast to the group, saying that the team will ultimately defeat the Legion of Doom, because the Legends are a family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:58:52.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
