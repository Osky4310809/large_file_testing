We weren’t really in a rush. We got married just before our 10-year dating anniversary.” \nChris proposed underneath the Christmas tree at Lindsay’s family’s house in Boston last year. “I was in the midst of stringing up garland and wreaths around the house,” remembers Lindsay. “I had just placed the final finishing touches on the tree. The first snowflakes of the year had begun to fall outside, covering everything in a blanket of freshly fallen snow. There were piles of presents; the room was lit up by the glittering lights on the tree and the roaring fire he’d made in the fireplace.” \nThey set a date for August, and Lindsay started planning. “[Prior to getting engaged,] I’d worked on the 371-page edit of the Vogue Weddings book with Hamish Bowles,” she says. “For months, I was engulfed in the history of weddings—mining the magazine’s matrimonial archive, researching countless ceremonies and celebrations, and writing detailed captions for pages of images that spanned from the present to the late 19th century. I talked trains and tulle with Oscar de la Renta and Vera Wang while writing up their profiles for the book’s Wedding Designer Guide. But amid all of the extravagance and grandeur, there were only a few classic and comparatively minimalistic black-and-white photographs from the 1940s and ’50s that truly caught my eye. Among them, Miss Sidney Bacon’s outdoor garden fete and Evelyn Byrd Dow’s midsummer wedding, where guests dined at one long banquet table shaded by a giant oak tree. I drew my inspiration from these.” Expand Left: Miss Sidney Bacon’s outdoor garden wedding.

Kennedy,” she says. \nThe rehearsal clambake dinner and the wedding both took place at Lindsay’s family’s turn-of-the-century rose gardens overlooking the sea in Little Boar’s Head, New Hampshire. The ceremony was held just across the road from the gardens underneath the shady bower of two giant 150-year-old majestic oak trees on the lawn of La Vigie, the bride’s great-grandmother’s summer house. “It’s my favorite place in the world,” says Lindsay. “I’ve been going there since I was born. My father and grandmother grew up spending their summers there as well.” \nThe Fuller Gardens were the vision of Lindsay’s great uncle and were designed in 1938 by the Olmsted Brothers. There are 1,700 rose bushes in the formal English walled garden and the circular wild garden, with over 125 different rose varieties. “The Colonial Revival–style Walled Garden is my favorite spot,” says Lindsay. “It has formal English borders, with perennials and annuals like delphinium, coneflowers, astilbe, salvias, hollyhocks, cleome, and it’s flanked by espaliered apple trees and privet hedges.” \nIn terms of aesthetics, the gardens already have a lot going on. “There are flowering trees from star magnolias to wisterias, kaleidoscopic dahlias, a Japanese garden and koi pond, hostas, a glass conservatory full of exotic and tropical plants, giant staghorn fern, succulents, a cacti collection, vining plants, and arbors covered with Boston ivy,” says Lindsay. “I didn’t want to compete with the landscape by adding too much else.” \nOn Friday evening, there was a rehearsal dinner clambake at the Fuller Gardens. “We had a good old-fashioned English roast; I think there were over ten speeches in total,” says Lindsay. “I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard. We served lobster—which I’m deathly allergic to, but wanted everyone to have as it’s so fresh and the area is famous for it.” \nThe ceremony was held the next day on the lawn at Lindsay’s great-grandmother’s house, La Vigie, underneath a bower of sprawling oak trees. “There is a charming little church, Union Chapel, on the edge of our property, but it is so tiny that it only fits about six people inside, so we decided to do the ceremony on the lawn of La Vigie instead,” says Lindsay. \nThe bride wore a Spring 2016 dress by Carolina Herrera. “Chris reads The New York Times every day, and though he generally doesn’t peruse the Style section, he happened to come across a roundup of 2016’s avant-garde wedding dresses, which he looked at sort of as a joke, but ultimately came across one dress that he—and I—both loved,” says Lindsay.

Illustrated by Hamish Bowles \nThe couple decided to forgo bridesmaids and groomsmen in favor of flower girls and page boys. “I carried a cascading bouquet inspired by the arrangement my grandmother carried in the 1940s,” says Lindsay. \nLindsay’s brother Teddy walked her down the aisle while a string quartet played the processional “Largo” (“Violin Concerto No. 4 in F Minor, ‘Winter’: II. Largo”) from Antonio Vivaldi’s Le Quattro Stagioni . “Chris is a classical pianist and choosing the music for the quartet to play was probably the only part of wedding planning that he actually enjoyed,” jokes Lindsay. \nThe reception was held in a sailcloth tent overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and the distant Isles of Shoals. There were long banquet tables with blue and white china. “My mother collected a ton of it,” says Lindsay. “She always said, ‘Blue and white is always right.’” \nAfter dinner, a 10-piece band from New York called Veronica Martell Entertainment kept guests entertained. “I was all about dancing,” says the bride. “And, at the end of the night, about 60 of us piled into one of the old-fashioned bright red trolleys we’d hired to transport guests to and from the festivities (it was definitely well over its legal passenger limit, no doubt) and we headed to an after-party at our cabana on the beach.” TK days later, the couple jetted off to the Cycladic island of Paros, where the groom’s family has a house, for their honeymoon. “We hopped around the neighboring Greek isles of Koufonisi and Amorgos, too.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T15:20:59.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
