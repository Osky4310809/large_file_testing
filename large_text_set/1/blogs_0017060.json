A total distraction to my teammates. Obviously disrespect to my coach. I’ve got utmost respect to my coach so I totally regret that.” \nBrown said he had hoped to give fans the opportunity to join in with the team’s celebration of its win over the Chiefs. \n“I’m human. I make mistakes. But as a man I own up to those mistakes. I was excited in the moment and wanted to give the fans the experience after the game,” Brown said. \nAsked if he expects to be disciplined for what he did, Brown answered, “That will be between me and the NFL.” \nAsked if he has a contract with Facebook, Brown said, “It’s top secret.” \nBrown appeared chastened by the comments of Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, who called Brown’s actions “selfish” and “foolish.” And Brown sounded ready to put his focus for the rest of the week on facing the Patriots.
