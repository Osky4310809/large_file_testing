Although this decision will hurt individuals who are financially struggling and are finding it difficult to pay off their loans, it will help the family of Taylor Hansen, a former lobbyist representing for-profit colleges. \nTaylor Hansen’s father, Bill Hansen , is CEO of the guaranty agency Strada Education Network, formerly known as United Student Aid Funds Inc. The firm was involved in a prolonged legal battle against the Department of Education — a lawsuit over this policy that has now been rendered effectively moot — but the policy change could add as much as $15 million to Strada’s yearly profits. \nTaylor Hansen resigned from the Department of Education on Friday, one day after DeVos released her memorandum. \nHansen’s presence in DeVos’s department has also been criticized because many for-profit colleges are opposed to the gainful employment rule, which withholds federal financial aid from colleges whose student loans are so steep that their graduates cannot earn enough to pay them off. Both of these issues prompted Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to send a public letter to DeVos about Hansen, arguing that his “recent employment history clearly calls into question his impartiality in dealing with higher education issues at the Department of Education, and raises alarming conflicts of interest concerns.” Matthew Rozsa is a breaking news writer for Salon.
