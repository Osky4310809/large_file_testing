In fact, according to the stats , the top three New Year‚Äôs resolutions for 2017 were to: \n1) Lose weight or eat healthier \n2) Improve life or self \n3) To make better financial decisions \nBuried in the stats, however, is a more telling number: 90.8%‚Ä¶ this is the huge percentage of people that feel they rarely or never realize their resolutions. In short, the issue is not necessarily setting the goal, but rather carving a path to achieve it. \nHere‚Äôs the good news‚Äìcreating a goal in and of itself has benefits. Setting goals is predictive of academic success and is also associated with increased productivity and creativity . So, how can we bridge the gap between setting goals and realizing them? We leverage something called implementation intentions. \nImplementation intentions are, according to the research , a way to ‚Äúlink anticipated critical situations to goal-directed responses.‚Äù I like to think of this as creating contingency plans for your goals. For example, if you went on a long road trip, you would most likely pack a supply kit in case of emergency. When it comes to creating goals, you should also arm yourself with supply kit of sorts. And this doesn‚Äôt even have to be complex! In fact, it can be done on paper napkin üôÇ \nIf you haven‚Äôt already guessed it, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to do for this week‚Äôs paper napkin challenge‚Ä¶ pick a goal and use implementation intentions as the emergency supply kit. All this involves is making if-then statements to help you plan for when things go awry. Paper Napkin Mental Health Challenge #4: Goal-Setting \nCheck out my challenge to help me get more sleep if you need a little inspiration! \nTry it yourself, here are 5 simple steps: Grab a paper napkin. Write one of your goals at the top of the napkin. Example: Goal = Get more sleep Draw a line down the middle of the napkin. On the left side, write ‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶‚Äù On the right side of the column, write ‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶‚Äù Under the ‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶‚Äù column, write down all of the possible things that stand between you and your goals. Example: ‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶ I wake up‚Äù Under the ‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶‚Äù column, write down a solution. Example: ‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll meditate‚Äù \nDon‚Äôt forget this step: Teach the technique to your kids and then ask them to teach it to one other person! \nHave an anxious child?
