The kids were born via surrogate mother on February 7. Karan, who was not in town when the news started making the rounds, has made a fashionable entry, and how. The filmmaker was spotted at the Mumbai airport. And this has to be his most stylish entry ever. Seriously, this one beats all the fabulous entries made by Karan on his chat show Koffee with Karan, and anywhere else. He was dressed in a black henley T shirt that he topped with a long military camouflage hoodie. Blue denim jean, and stylish yet simple black sneakers added more to his style statement. And a fabulous pair of sunglasses provided the finishing touch to the look. Seriously, for this outing he gets a 10 on 10. Not only he was casual, but maintained a sense of style at the same time. He is indeed going to be stylish dad. Roohi and Yash will never have trouble explaining fashion to their proud father. \nJust look at those super sleek shades! \nThat jacket is sick! \nA look at Kjo’s shoes! We are trying to find those shoes on online stores as well. \nAnd the trademark Karan Johar pout \nEarly in the morning, Karan released a statement confirming the news, and expressed how he felt. “I feel enormously blessed to be a parent to these pieces of my heart who were welcomed into this world with the help of the marvels of medical science. This was an emotional yet well thought out decision which I have taken after considering all the responsibilities and duties that come with being a parent. In order to arrive at this decision, I have prepared myself mentally, physically, emotionally and logistically to ensure that my children get all the unconditional love, care and attention from me and mine,” the statement read. \nAll we gotta say is that Karan Johar sure knows how to make stylish entry. \nBollywood has been wishing the filmmaker on Twitter since morning. Priyanka Chopra, Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Sushant Singh Rajput – have all congratulated him.
