Bible Verses for Comfort in Loss \n\"The LORD is close to the brokenhearted; he rescues those who are crushed in spirit.\" ( Psalm 34:18, NLT) \n\"The unfailing love of the LORD never ends! By his mercies we have been kept from complete destruction. Great is his faithfulness; his mercies begin afresh each day. I say to myself, 'The LORD is my inheritance; therefore, I will hope in him!' \nThe LORD is wonderfully good to those who wait for him and seek him. So it is good to wait quietly for salvation from the LORD. \nFor the Lord does not abandon anyone forever. Though he brings grief, he also shows compassion according to the greatness of his unfailing love.\" (Lamentations 3:22-26; 31-32, NLT)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:58:54.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
