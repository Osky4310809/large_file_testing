They’re great for wars with your buds or just for annoying the hell out of your relatives or drunk friends .\nThat being said, have you ever wondered what would happen if someone dialed up a Nerf cannon that could shoot a dart at more than twice the speed of sound? That would be just a tick over 1,700 miles per hour for the math-impaired.\nIf you have wondered about that then wonder no more because some mad genius, Giaco Whatever , created an air cannon to do that very thing.\nThe result? Well, it busted a damn hole in this piece of wood before exploding into little Nerf bits…\nYouTube - Giaco Whatever\n\nYeah, that would probably leave a mark on a human being. \nBut hey, at least it wouldn’t be fatal, I think. Which is something I can’t say about his next attempt which involves trying to get a Nerf dart to fire at a speed of Mach 5.\nOh yeah, the best part? The fact that he shows other, probably way less qualified people, how to make one themselves!! Yay?\n\nCool, huh? \nHe also has more Nerf videos and other inventions that are perhaps even more insane. Check these out…\n\n\n\nH/T Sploid \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:02:04.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
