For hundreds of millions of people around the globe, however, things are much different.\nAccording to Water.org, roughly 1 in 10 people lacks access to clean water. They’re working to improve on that ratio, and so are the team behind a new Kickstarter project called the Tekniv Nexus .\nThe Nexus is “a fully modular renewable energy system.” The version that they’re launching via Kickstarter is aimed at water purification, and it can handle a pretty hefty workload. According to Tekniv, the Nexus can provide enough power to produce around 500 gallons of clean water ever day.\nWhat’s more, the Nexus can do it for just 1/13th the cost of traditional solar and 1/5th the cost of a similar fossil-fuel powered solution. The Nexus units are quite portable (in infrastructure terms, at least) and contain very few moving parts — which will help keep unscheduled maintenance to a minimum.\n\nThe system doesn’t use any chemicals, nor does it depend on reverse osmosis. Water is heated to 100° C for a few minutes, evaporated, and then condensed. Even on a cloudy day, Tekniv says the Nexus can pump out around 100 gallons of purified water.\nThe Tekniv team has already successfully crowdfunded another creation, the Tekdaqc : “a professional grade, affordable data acquisition, and control board .” The Tecdaqc is now in use at organizations like NASA and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich .\nThis is a group that has already proven that they can deliver the goods once. Now you can help them deliver something amazing to people who desperately need it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T15:02:10.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
