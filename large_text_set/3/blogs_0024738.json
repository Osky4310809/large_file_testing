Twitter \nJust look at this transformation. The stance of the “male” is perfection, and she even wore her hair higher to give the fictional guy some height. Truly, it was a stellar performance. \nOh, to be young and hang out with my best friend every day again, coming up with hilarious ideas to troll the guys who are into us. \nDo not take this time for granted, friends. \nSoon, you will be old like me, and your friendships will be limited to text messages because you live in different states or your work schedules don’t mesh up and you’ll be forced to photoshop your friend looking like a guy into the background of your pictures.
