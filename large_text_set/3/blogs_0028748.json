The FC panel yet again debate Arsene Wenger's impact at Arsenal, and if his vision should still be trusted at the club. Paul Mariner feels his former club Arsenal should take some risks, including possibly parting ways with Arsene Wenger. ESPN FC's Paul Mariner believes Ashley Cole's comments about the plight of Arsenal are not meant to be taken seriously. Craig Burley says Arsene Wenger is showing how arrogant he is through his handling of his future at Arsenal. \nMesut Ozil has said he is still \"very happy\" at Arsenal but \"something is not working with the team\" at the moment. \nOzil's future is undecided as contract talks with Arsenal have been put off until the summer. Speculation has increased in recent weeks that Ozil and Alexis Sanchez, who is also yet to commit his future to the club, could be sold when the season ends, but Ozil told German news agency dpa that nothing has been decided. \n\"The fact is I've still got a contract in London,\" Ozil said in quotes reported by the Mirror . \"To speculate now would be wrong. At the end of the season we will see, there will be talks. I'm very happy at Arsenal and in London.\" \nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger said this week that the club has put the contract talks with the star duo on hold after failing to come to an agreement with either. Wenger's own future is also in doubt as his contract expires this summer, with the pressure growing on the manager after a string of recent losses. Mesut Ozil joined Arsenal from Real Madrid in 2013. \nArsenal are only sixth in the Premier League after losing four of their last five matches, and were knocked out of the Champions League 10-2 on aggregate by Bayern Munich. \n\"We are having a difficult phase. Somehow something is not working with the team,\" Ozil said. \"We are letting in a lot of goals. Maybe it's down to self-belief. When I look at the quality of Arsenal though I'm convinced we will get on a run again soon.\" \nOzil has not started a game since the first 5-1 loss to Bayern in Germany because of illness and injury, and missed the national team's friendly against England on Wednesday with a hamstring problem. \nOzil has previously said he will not decide whether to stay at Arsenal until he knows what Wenger is doing. But he said the players are still in the dark regarding the manager's plans. \n\"I don't know what he will decide,\" he said. \"That's something we will have to wait for.\" \nMattias is ESPN FC's Arsenal correspondent.
