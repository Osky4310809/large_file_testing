Successive state governors had tried to get reimbursement for the excess deductions from their states in the past but did not succeed. The failure resulted from a number of reasons, varying from one state to the other. It is therefore to the Nigeria Governors’ Forum’s credit that this set of governors was able to persuade President Muhammadu Buhari to authorize the release of the funds for disbursement to deserving states. \n“President Buhari’s desire to reflate the economy at a time when states were insolvent and unable to pay salaries was why he acceded to the request by the current group of governors that the money be released to the states. It is true that there were conditions attached to the disbursements but these arose from the collective and voluntary resolution of the governors and not any draconian order from any quarters.” \nThis, he said, showed that the governors are responsible, sensitive and compassionate enough to understand the plight of Nigerians that they govern and are working in the interest of their people. \nHe insisted that due process was diligently followed in approving the repayment. \n“And each and every approving authority, including the Federal Ministry ofFinance, the office of the Accountant General of the Federation, the Central Bank of Nigeria and the office of the Auditor General of the Federation as well as the National Assembly were duly informed from the beginning to the end of all the transactions. \n“Nothing illegal was done and no monies was paid into the personal account of any Governor, legislator or top officials at any of the levels and arms of government in the country.”he said \nHe also noted that President Muhammadu Buhari would not have approved the payment of the second tranche of the refund to the states, if the Federal Government had found anything corrupt, illegal and unpatriotic about the utilization of the first tranche of the Paris-London Clubs Fund. \nHe added “Note also most importantly at this juncture, that every decision that was taken in respect of all the transactions was with the full consent and blessing of the 36 governors. \n“We therefore find the insinuation in the media that monies went into the private accounts of seven unidentified governors as not only preposterous but mischievous. \n“This is more so because none of the reports was able to identify a single governor, not to talk of seven. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) itself had issued a release exculpating all the governors, saying it was investigating the matter further. \n“But instead of allowing the EFCC to conclude its investigations, a particular section of the media resorted to this unsavory falsehood which puts the media and its practitioners in bad light.” he stated", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T17:21:11.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
