Pair animal print jackets with black pants and a white shirt, or a navy ziz-zags over heather blue sweatpants. Floral Shirts A post shared by Victor Cruz (@teamvic) on Dec 4, 2016 at 7:21am PST \nDon’t let Jay-Z distract you from the serious print game Victor Cruz serves here. By extending the same hue of navy from the shirt into the jacket, Vic looks streamlined but still stands out . If you’re adding a tie, pick a solid one in the same color family as your print. Shaded Shoe A post shared by @menwithfootwear on Jan 6, 2017 at 1:56am PST \nYou don’t have to wear full camo to amp up your shoe game . The green and black ombre here adds depth to the look without screaming “look at me!” Printed Pant A post shared by Nick Young (@swaggyp1) on Feb 7, 2017 at 5:14pm PST \nWhen it comes to printed pants, consider pinstripes, camo, and houndstooth your new basics. You’ll never go wrong if you pair them with a solid colored top. Decorative Scarf A post shared by J.Crew Men's (@jcrewmens) on May 26, 2016 at 7:31am PDT \nThink beyond the patterned tie, here. A cool scarf is another stylish way to dress up your outfit. Drape it over your shoulders and halfway under your jacket, and keep it refined in ivories, charcoals, or jewel tones. The piece says you’re the type of guy who loves leather-bound books and a fine cab.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:31:30.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
