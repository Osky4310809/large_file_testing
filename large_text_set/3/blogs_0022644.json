He said ‘There was a craze about 10 years ago and it died out.\nA warning has been issued asking people not to do it (Picture: SWNS) ‘All of a sudden we are getting reports again. We have got a huge amount of them being burnt at the moment.\n‘It is growing – there is 100 per cent more than there was last month.’\nMr Hall said many people were not reporting the bin fires to police, making it hard to provide statistics on the crimes.\nHe said: ‘Just one aerosol might cause a potentially fatal explosion.\n‘And bins stolen from business premises could contain just about anything that can cause fatal injury to the unwary.\n‘Our people are sick of having to scrape melted plastic from pavements and parks, and our clients hate the inconvenience of having their bins stolen.’\nStephen Ream, a spokesman for solvent abuse charity Re-Solv, said: ‘It would be very dangerous, it sounds like it would make you sick before you got high.\n‘The fumes it would give off would be toxic.’\nIn 2007 it was reported that in Scotland it is known for people to burn bus shelters to get the same effect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:17:53.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
