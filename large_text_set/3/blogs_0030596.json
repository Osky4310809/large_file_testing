Blond children, like Mark Lester in Oliver! , look angelic. But the combination of cherubic ringlets with weathered features is all wrong. Innocence and age don’t belong together. That’s why fiction is awash with blond men doing bad things. From Max Zorin in A View to a Kill to the Lannisters in Game of Thrones , the bad blond just looks right. \nUnfortunately, the world today seems to be in the grip of a monstrous case of life imitating art. Mad improbably fair-haired men are ruining the world. The schlocky trope has jumped from the movies into real life and Roger Moore’s too old to save us. Everywhere you turn men who look like the Milky Bar Kid’s strange uncle are destroying democracy and spreading prejudice. The Malfoys are running the salon. How often should I wash my hair? You asked Google – here’s the answer | Jessica Hopkins Read more \nThere are now so many real-life blond baddies that it’s only natural to wonder whether every man with the full Pat Butcher is evil. The only rational answer is obviously: no, of course not. But … but. We don’t live in a rational world. We live in a world where reason and evidence mean nothing. Where a man who felt the need to come to the defence of his own penis during a political debate attained the highest office on the planet. In a world like this who are we to say that pure evil doesn’t take the form of Macaulay Culkin ? \nWe already know who the truly evil blond men are, they’re hard to miss after all. But to definitively answer this important question we must look beyond Donald Trump, Geert Wilders, Milo Yiannopoulos , Julian Assange and Robbie Savage and consider a more diverse range of blond man. Ben Fogle ‘If his survival requires your suffering and, indeed, your death then, well, Ben Fogle is at peace with that.’ Photograph: Channel 5 \nBen Fogle ’s a nice chap, isn’t he? He looks like the kind of man who’d apologise for the weather. He probably worked in a Christian holiday camp in the summer before university and hasn’t sworn since John Major’s election victory in 92. He always has time for the homeless and wouldn’t dream of taking up a seat on public transport. He looks innocent enough to still be breastfed. \nPut Fogle in a survival situation , however, and you can be quite sure he’d have your foot on the fire in no time. If his survival requires your suffering and, indeed, your death then, well, Fogle is at peace with that. Fogle wouldn’t exactly take pleasure in your pain but if the propagation of his own genes is at stake, he won’t hesitate. Fogle must go on. Michael Heseltine ‘Whether you’re an old woman or hundreds of squirrels, once you have ceased to be useful to Michael Heseltine he will cast you aside.’ Photograph: EPA \nTarzan belongs to that swept-back subset of blond men who always look like they have spent the last 10 minutes rimming an elephant. See also Wilders and Zorin. But the defining characteristic of Heseltine, after the hair, is his ruthlessness. Whether you’re an old woman or hundreds of squirrels , once you have ceased to be useful to Heseltine he will cast you aside like the offer of a short back and sides. If he can, Heseltine will find a way to oust you. He’ll oust you right out of existence – just ask his dog . Boris Johnson ‘Boris Johnson campaigned for a cause he didn’t believe in, based on promises he must have known to be false.’ Photograph: PA \nThe kid at school who always took the prank too far. You can imagine the scene: Eton 1978. For a while it was funny to watch Daniel search for his Princess Leia pencil case but when it became clear that poor Daniel was in some distress everyone came clean and told him it was under the desk. But Boris didn’t want the joke to end. Boris snatched the pencil case and lobbed it out of the third-floor window. Daniel cried. Boris laughed. Boris has never thought about Daniel again. \nHe’s funny though. He campaigned for a cause he didn’t believe in, based on promises he must have known to be false, resulting in years of chaos and probably the breakup of the union. That Boris Johnson is funny. Aled Jones ‘Aled Jones wears chunky knitwear.’ Photograph: Getty Images \nThere’s no one sweeter than Aled Jones . His name’s Aled for a start. Aled’s your friend. Aled’s a hugger. Aled wears chunky knitwear. Aled likes the raisins in M&S couscous. Aled once wept over a single discarded mitten he found on the street. But, let’s be honest, it must get pretty tiring being Aled Jones. Imagine being Aled Jones and walking down the street. \n“Oi Aled!” \n“Why aren’t you walking in the air Aled?” \nAled pretends not to hear and walks on. He’s got to go to Boots. \n“Aled! ALED! Why aren’t you walking in the air, Al d?” \nIt’s surely only a matter of time before Aled Jones snaps. \nSo are blond men evil? From the evidence above the answer has to be an unequivocal: yes. Blond men are evil. All blond men are evil. Even Mark Lester , and he’s not even blond any more.
