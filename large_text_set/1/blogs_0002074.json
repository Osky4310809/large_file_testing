Some of the features center on graphics. The press release says the new chip will have 25 percent faster 3D graphic rendering compared to the older Snapdragon 820, along 60 times more display colors. The Snapdragon 835 will also have 20 percent less motion-to-photon latency.\nSmartphone cameras will also get some zoom and stabilization improvements with the new chip, along with better and faster auto-focus. The Snapdragon 835 was made on a new 10nm design, and it will be 30 percent smaller than the Snapdragon 820. This should allow smartphones to be thinner while still adding larger batteries. The chip will also use 40 percent less power while still getting a 27 percent performance increase. Qualcomm has already announced that the chip will support Quick Charge 4 , which should be capable of adding five hours of battery life with just 5 minutes of charging time.\nWhile Qualcomm has yet to announce which phones will get the Snapdragon 835 processor, ASUS has already hinted it will reveal a phone with the new chip at CES this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T05:35:30.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
