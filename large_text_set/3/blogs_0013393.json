Just recently, we were amazed by the heart-pounding story of a poodle being rescued seconds before running into a busy highway. There was also the story we can’t forget of the bus driver who broke company rules to allow two stray dogs onto his bus to escape a thunderstorm. Seeing these stories gives us hope that there are plenty of people who see animals as valuable and important members of our society. \nAnd this heartwarming story is no different. Here we see a dolphin who was caught with fishing net wrapped around both his back fin and body. Luckily, the kind man who spotted the dolphin didn’t just sit idly by and let this animal suffer, he did what an animal lover would do: he decided to help . As you can see in the above video , the man untangles the dolphin from the net while inside his boat, then picks up the dolphin and places him back in the ocean. The dolphin happily swims back home! \nWe are thrilled to see caring people helping animals in distress. With dolphins being among the most complex and intelligent species on the planet, it’s no wonder this man assisted this dolphin. If you ever come across an animal in need, it is always important to seek the advice of a trained professional before stepping in to help. If you find yourself in this situation, check out these rescue hotlines for someone who can help. \nLead Image Source: SimonMettler /Pixabay Want to read more posts like this?
