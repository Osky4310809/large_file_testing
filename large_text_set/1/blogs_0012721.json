It's a difficult language to master. In many rural areas, English grammar becomes relaxed and just plain wrong. How's your grammar? Here are five quick English grammar tips for native English speakers. Brush up before you go back to school . You might save yourself a little embarrassment. \nAnd while you're at it, pick up a grammar book and listen carefully to the people around you who you know have proper grammar. Listen . \nWithout using a lot of confusing grammatical language, I'll explain as easily as I can why the following examples are mistakes. \nBe sure to check out: Image Source - Vetta - Getty Images 104187465 1. Me and Tim, Tim and I \nWrong: Me and Tim are going to a movie tonight. \nRight: Tim and I are going to a movie tonight. \nWhy? \nIf you take Tim out of the sentence, \"you\" are the subject. You are going to a movie. When you're going to a movie, what do you say? \n\"I am going to a movie.\" \nYou wouldn't say, \"Me am going to a movie.\" \nWhen you add Tim, the sentence construction remains the same. You're simply adding Tim, and it's correct to say the other person's name first. \n\"Tim and I are going to a movie.\" \nYour test is always to take the other person out of the sentence, decide on \"I\" or \"me,\" and then put the other person back in. \ncontinue reading below our video Learn ESL: What Are the Tenses in English? Image Source - Digital Vision - Getty Images 104187332 2. We Was, We Were \n\"Am, are, was, and were\" are all parts of the powerful little verb, \"to be.\" \nWhat trips people up with this mighty little verb is present tense and past tense. If something is happening now, it's present tense. If it already happened, it's past tense. \nSingular and plural also becomes a problem. Compare the following: \nWe (Tim and I) \"are\" going to a movie. (present tense, plural) \nI \"am\" going to a movie. (present tense, singular) \nWe (Tim and I) \"were\" going to a movie. (past tense, plural) \nI \"was\" going to a movie. (past tense, singular) \nCan you hear the difference? \nIt is never correct to say, \"We was...\" \nWhy? Because we is plural. We always \"were\"... \nVariation on this problem: \nI see. I saw. I have seen. \nNever: I seen. zhang bo - E Plus - Getty Images 136327039 3. Had Ran, Had Run \nI heard this on the scanner in the newsroom one day: \"He had ran into the woods by the time I got there.\" \nWrong. \nRight: \"He had run into the woods by the time I got there.\" \nThis is a problem of not understanding the perfect tense. \nIt's confusing, no doubt. \nKenneth Beare, About.com's ESL Expert, has a complete English Tenses Timeline . \nRichard Nordquist, About.com's Grammar and Composition Expert, also offers help with English tenses. Hiep Vu - Radius Images - Getty Images 103317630 4. She Don't, She Done \nThis is a problem of conjugating the verb, \"to do.\" \nWrong: She don't know what she's talking about. (You wouldn't say, \"She do not know...\") \nRight: She doesn't know what she's talking about. (She does not know...) \nWrong: Everyone knows she done it. (\"Done\" is not the past tense of did.) \nRight: Everyone knows she did it. \nKenneth Beare's English Tenses Timeline is a good source for help here, too.

Well, fixing whatever is broken might involve finances, but that's another matter altogether. \nI hear people say, \"It's broke,\" when they mean, \"It's broken.\" \nThis problem has to do with the part of speech called past participles . Listen: \nIt breaks. \nIt has broken. Or: It is broken. \nNever: It is broke . \nHave You Tried Grammarly? \nGrammarly.com is one easy way to check your grammar.
