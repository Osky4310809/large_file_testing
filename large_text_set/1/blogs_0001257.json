After reviewing the details of the case for two hours he said it's one of the worst he's ever seen. \"I believe this was a systemic, slow death that was almost a form of torture that they imposed upon their child.\"As a result of his review, McCoy believes home visits for homeschooling families are one possible remedy to correct the failures in the system.\nAs a result of his review, McCoy believes home visits for homeschooling families are one possible remedy to correct the failures in the system.\nFinnâ€™s parents were charged this month with multiple felonies related Natalie's death and the alleged abuse of two of her siblings.\nNicole Finn, 42, faces first-degree murder charges, three counts of first-degree kidnapping, one count of child endangerment resulting in death, three counts of child endangerment causing serious injury and three counts of neglect of a dependent person.\nJoseph Finn II, 45, faces charges of first-degree kidnapping, three counts of child endangerment causing serious injury and three counts of neglect of a dependent person.\nAccording to McCoy, Finn and her siblings were the subjects of \"numerous\" reports of neglect and child abuse before the teen's death in October, but she was never removed from the home even though the multiple reports were given to the Iowa Department of Human Services from different sources, some from mandatory reporters.\n\"It seems to me the department failed in giving them enough credibility and enough weight to know that these were really valuable insights that these folks were sharing with the department,\" McCoy said.\nOne neighbor, Becca Gordon, whose son attended school with Finn, complained that her reports of abuse were not followed up on. She told KCCI that she and other neighbors kept an eye on Finn's house and reported their suspicions to authorities.\n7 Things My Wife and I Learned From 22 Years of Homeschooling\n\"We can only do what? Report to the police, DHS, and then we trust that something is going to happen, that they're going to follow up, that they're going to keep these kids safe. Well, that did not happen,\" Gordon said.\nOne report from Gordon showed that Finn tried to run away from home in April. Another showed that Gordon called police to say Finn had appeared at her door asking for food and money, looked \"unkept\" with blisters on her feet and no shoes, and smelled heavily of body odor. There was another report to police from Gordon saying that Natalie told her \"she was locked in her bedroom by her mother because one of the pets urinated on the floor.\"\nhttps://pjmedia.com/parenting/2017/01/02/iowa-lawmaker-wants-home-checks-for-homeschoolers-in-wake-of-death-of-starved-teen/\nload more View as single page", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sg-GDJ5eDOU", "http://www.kcci.com/article/state-senator-calls-16-year-old-s-death-worst-he-s-ever-seen/8547483"], "published": "2017-01-02T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:10:56.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
