After all, what's a late-night booty call without the explicit promise of feasting on some eggplant?\nGay dating app Grindr understands this all too perfectly, and this week released its own set of custom emoji designed to slide comfortably right into that naughty place in your texting heart.\nSEE ALSO: These are the online dating emoji your love life desperately needs\nPink News first picked up the semiotic breakthrough , and noted that there are more than just pierced aubergines to experiment with. Whether it's a cloud of raining men, a peeping eye, or a dude on a top bunk, the character set provides Grindr's mostly male user base with plenty of options to telegraph their desire.\nGrindr now has custom Emoji ðŸ™ˆ pic.twitter.com/w4qrSmM0u8\nâ€” Paul Winkler (@MrPaulWinkler) March 14, 2017\nHandcuffs, leather daddies, a unicorn, and a polaroid of a peach â€” there's a little something for everyone.\nThe update is not without a key bump of controversy, however, as at least one user pointed out that \"T\" is slang for meth.

This one is perhaps the easiest: Humans have long sought to tame their animal nature, and this emoji represents man's internal conflict as he seeks to beat back his baser instincts. It's some deep, philosophical stuff.\nThat brings us to the blindfolded and ball-gagged man . This image clearly tackles the small but meaningful compromises we are all forced to make as we go about our lives in a post-industrial society. Asked to ignore all the injustices in the world, we blind ourselves and keep trudging on.\nWe're not sure how this will be used in the context of Grindr, but we're also not about to judge.\nThe doll stabbed with pins, meanwhile, symbolizes rejecting childish things and turning toward a life of responsibility. That's definitely what it means.\nAnd the rooster? That's just a cock.\nWATCH: Here's a timelapse of the snowstorm as it blankets NYC with snow", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/JVGKbd6F.jpg", "http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/03/14/grindr-launches-custom-gay-emojis-and-theyre-as-filthy-as-youd-expect/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/JVGKbd6F.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/RichJuz/status/841487407287566336", "https://t.co/HD6HvX5K01", "https://t.co/w4qrSmM0u8", "https://twitter.com/MrPaulWinkler/status/841725902736261121", "http://cdn.pinknews.co.uk/images/2017/03/grimoji2.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-15T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:15:35.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
