Culver's A Wisconsin native now living in Wake Forest is planning to bring a little slice of his old home to his new hometown with the planned opening of the Triangle's first Culver's restaurant. Wake Forest franchise owner Erik Neudecker has contracted the rights to build potentially multiple new locations for Wisconsin-based Culver's – a direct competitor of Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers, which is also expanding in the Triangle with three locations. Both are quick-service, family-style restaurants that specialize in big burgers and frozen custard shakes. Culver's also throws in its specialty Wisconsin cheese curds for good measure. Culver's now has 600 locations. Culver's Neudecker will be opening his first Culver’s at 2819 Rogers Road at the corner of Heritage Center Drive, next to the new Rite Aid drug store near The Factory sports and retail complex on Main Street. He’s working with Kotis Properties of Greensboro to identify sites for as many as 10 future stores, says Jeff Nimmer , a broker and top executive with Kotis Properties who along with Tyler Quinn represented Neubecker in the Wake Forest land deal. Phil Begany and Marlane Klintworth of Lat Purser & Associates represented the landowner. According to real estate records, Neudecker’s partnership paid $880,000 for the 1.3-acre lot. Lat Purser has been overseeing the retail development of the corner, which also includes the Rite Aid store and future locations for O’Reilly Auto Parts, Starbucks, Mod Pizza and Zoom dry cleaning, Begany says. Culver’s currently has two other locations in North Carolina, one each in Charlotte and in Arden, but the Wake Forest location will be the 600-unit restaurant chain’s first in the Triangle.
