How did this all begin? \nAccording to papers filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in April 2015 Jenner attempted to register the mark \"KYLIE\" in the US for \"advertising services\" and \"endorsement services\". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Jenner is the younger half-sister of Kim Kardashian \nIn response, Minogue's team filed their opposition in February 2016, citing possible confusion and \"damage\" to Minogue's branding. \nThey noted Minogue was an \"internationally renowned performing artist, humanitarian and breast cancer activist\" who already owns Kylie-related trademarks in the US in several industries, as well as the website www.kylie.com. \nJenner, on the other hand, was dismissed as a \"secondary reality television personality\" who had drawn criticism from her \"photographic exhibitionism and controversial posts\" on social media. Image copyright Twitter / @kylieminogue Image caption In February 2016 Minogue tweeted this message, shortly after her team filed its opposition \nThe case was suspended at least twice in 2016 for settlement negotiations. So which Kylie came out on top? \nOn 19 January Minogue's team withdrew its opposition, which means Jenner's application could proceed. \nThis raises the possibility that they agreed to a settlement. \nThe BBC approached both sides, but Jenner's lawyers declined comment, and Minogue's team did not respond. The USPTO does not comment on individual cases.

But this was rejected in July last year. \nOn 23 January, Jenner's team appealed against this decision. What is at stake in this battle? \nLast year, Jenner launched a line of cosmetics called KYLIE. \nAccording to her latest appeal, she wants to eventually have \"KYLIE JENNER\" branded clothing as well as loungewear, swimwear, and underwear. \nMeanwhile, Minogue owns \"KYLIE\" and other similar trademarks in perfumes and toiletries, music and sound recordings, live entertainment, jewellery, dolls and toys, and printed matter such as magazines and books. \nSo far, Minogue has released fragrances, furniture and clothes with the trademark on them. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In 2007 Minogue launched her fragrance line which is registered in the US as Kylie Minogue Darling \nShe also had previously said in interviews she intends to one day produce a musical featuring her greatest hits, and owns the US trademark for \"Lucky: The Kylie Minogue Musical\". \nBut it's more than that. Since the 1980s, Kylie Minogue has never had to go by any other name but Kylie, and her team has argued it's a fundamental part of the pop diva's identity. \nEven with a possible settlement, what the battle shows is that at the very least brand KYLIE is not won without a fight. \nReporting by the BBC's Tessa Wong, Kevin Ponniah and Jay Savage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:38:37.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
