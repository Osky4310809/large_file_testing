Britain's nuclear deterrent explained Watch | What is Trident? Britain's nuclear deterrent explained 01:14 23 January 2017 • 10:53am What is Trident? \nT rident is Britain's nuclear weapons deterrent. It consists of four Vanguard-class submarines which can carry up to 16 Trident II D5 ballistic missiles, each armed with up to eight nuclear warheads. \nAt any time, one submarine is on patrol, one is undergoing maintenance, one is preparing for patrol and one has just come off patrol and is recovering. \nBritain has had a Continuous At Sea Deterrence (CASD) since 1969. Trident is currently referred to (in defence speak) as Operation Relentless and is based in the Faslane area of Scotland. HMS Vanguard is Britain's lead Trident-armed submarine Will renewal get the green light? \nA lmost certainly. The current fleet, which has been in operation since 1992, needs to be phased out in the 2030s. It will take up to 17 years to replace the submarines, which means the final decision on renewal needs to be made this year. \nCarrying out the vote, which takes place on Monday, July 18, will be one of Theresa May's first major jobs as Prime Minister. Watch | Fallon: This is the wrong time to dispense with Trident 01:41 \nT he Government has estimated four new submarines - which should have a lifespan of at least 30 years - would cost £31 billion spread over 35 years with a £10 billion contingency. \nThis amounts to 0.2 per cent per year of government spending. The annual running cost is expected to be about the same as it is now - representing about six per cent of the government's defence budget. \nBefore Trident, there was Polaris which operated on four submarines between 1962 and 1992. Trident Who wants to renew it? \nM rs May has been clear about her desire to renew Trident. Former prime minister David Cameron also wanted to renew the controversial programme, calling it an \"insurance policy\" for Britain. Replacing it was a Conservative manifesto pledge in the 2015 general election. \nThe Labour Party also supports Trident, however leader and life-long pacifist Jeremy Corbyn has proposed to have Trident submarines without nuclear missiles , adding that he would never “press the button” to launch nuclear weapons. He is currently vice-president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Watch | Watson: Corbyn is wrong over Trident 01:23 \nT wo thirds of Labour MPs are expected to vote against him at Monday's vote. Two of the country’s biggest trade unions – Unite and GMB – which have supported Mr Corbyn during his leadership crisis so far are expected to back keeping Trident too because so many jobs rely on it. \nThe Scottish National Party and the Green Party are opposed to Trident. The Liberal Democrats want to end 24 hour patrols and cut back the number of submarines, believing they're designed for a Cold War threat that no longer exists.

It argues that Trident is \"vital\" for our security because since the end of the Cold War the number of nuclear armed states has grown, nations are modernising their weapons and we need to be ready for any unsuspecting nuclear threat to the UK over the next 20 to 50 years. \nNuclear defence is also a big employer - it currently supports approximately 30,000 UK jobs. \nPeople and campaign groups who oppose Trident argue having nuclear weapons is immoral and that the more nations that possess them, the more likely they are to be used. They also argue that threats to the UK come from other sources that don't require a nuclear deterrent, and point out that money spent on Trident could be better spent elsewhere - including maintaining and improving conventional methods of defence. How powerful is Trident? \nN o one knows exactly, but most nuclear weapons are approximately seven times more powerful than the atomic bomb which was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945. \nTrident's ballistic missiles can hit a target up to 7,500 miles away and travel at speeds of more than 13,000 miles an hour. Mark 4 Trident Missile Warhead Rocket M What do we know about the submarines? \nT he UK's Vanguard-class submarines are called HMS Vanguard, HMS Vengeance, HMS Victorious and HMS Vigilant. They are huge - measuring more than twice the size of two Boeing 747s. Each contains a nuclear reactor which boils sea water and the steam is used to power them through the water. \nThe patrols are so secretive that only four among the crew of 135 know what route the submarine will take, on voyages lasting months. Vanguard Class Nuclear Subs Are there any alternatives? \nT he government said in its 2013 Trident Alternatives Review that no alternative system is as effective or capable as the current Trident system, or as cost effective. \nCruise missiles have been considered but they were deemed too slow and with a far shorter range and easy to intercept. There's also been talk of a land-based delivery system, negating the need for submarines, but both of these options have been deemed too expensive in the long-run. Who can launch the weapons? \nOnly the UK Prime Minister can authorise the launch of nuclear weapons. The PM's order to fire is sent to a strategic headquarters and then transmitted by several paths to the submarine in coded messages. \nAt each stage below Prime Minister there are two people in the firing chain, ensuring no single person can launch a nuclear attack. Once the message arrives at the submarine, it must be decoded to ensure it is authentic. \nThe command that no one among the crew wants to hear would then be given: “Actions stations, missile for strategic launch.” \nEvery PM must write four \"letters of last resort\" which are kept secret in a safe on board each submarine in case there's a devastating nuclear attack on the UK. \nThey are only allowed to be read in the event that the Prime Minister and his second-in-command are killed and Westminster is wiped out. The submarine commander will then carry out a series of checks (including seeing if BBC Radio 4 is still broadcasting), read the note and then carry out the final orders. When a new Prime Minister is appointed, the letters must be destroyed so only they know their contents. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon inside HMS Vigilant in the missiles compartment. Credit: PA Who is in the nuclear weapons club? \nN ine countries have nuclear weapons: The US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. \nThe UK is one of five countries along with the US, China, Russia and France formally recognised as a ‘Nuclear Weapon State’ under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which aims to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. \nThe NPT was negotiated in 1968 and all members agreed to the three pillars - working towards disarmament, non-proliferation, and peaceful nuclear technology. In return the non-nuclear signatories to the Treaty (every other country in world bar India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea, all of whom possess nuclear weapons outside the Treaty) agreed not to acquire nuclear weapons. \nIn line with this, Britain cut its operational warheads from 160 in 2010 to 120 in 2015, and slashed the number of warheads on patrol from 48 to 40 in the same period. \nIt's worth noting that the UK has significantly fewer nuclear weapons than the US and Russia, and has what is called a \"minimum deterrent\" - the ability to inflict massive devastation but with minimum nuclear force. When was the first nuclear explosion? \nThe world's first nuclear weapons explosion took place on July 16, 1945, in New Mexico, when the US tested its first nuclear bomb. \nThree weeks later, on August 6, 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima killing and wounding 130,000 people. Three days after that, the US bombed Nagasaki, killing 74,000 people. These acts resulted in the surrender of Japan on August 14, 1945 and the end of the Second World War. \nThe US remains the only nation to have actually used nuclear weapons in conflict.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T13:03:25.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
