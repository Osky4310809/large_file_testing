The design includes two pilots who are wearing helmets and goggles Credit: lego \nT he Red Arrows are one of the world's premier aerobatic plane teams who put on displays to millions of people every year. \nThe Squadron is famous for performing dynamic loops, rolls, close passes and formation shapes with its nine fast-jets – flying as close as six feet apart at 350mph. \nFlying distinctive Hawk jets, the team is the public face of the RAF and represent speed, agility and precision. Over 2000 votes in 2 days! If we reach 10,000 LEGO will consider making this Hawk as an official set.

But despite being submitted in 2015 it has only garnered around 2,600 likes. A WW1 German fighter plane Fokker Dr.I was also submitted in 2015 but gained even fewer likes. \nTwo other entries - a Venetian house and a Jeep Wrangler - are also on the verge of hitting the 10,000 likes threshold which means Lego will consider them for manufacture. However unlike the Red Arrow, which has suddenly become popular, they were both submitted several months ago. This Jeep design has nearly enough likes for Lego to consider it Credit: Lego \nT he Red Arrows said: \"For this LEGO Ideas submission, we have captured the passion and excitement of the Red Arrows and constructed the iconic BAE Systems Hawk T1 aircraft (powered by a Rolls-Royce engine) out of LEGO parts. \n\"Not only does this proposed Red Arrows Hawk LEGO model have functioning components (retractable undercarriage and opening cockpit canopy), it includes both a pilot and engineer minifigure (each wearing their iconic red and blue flying suits). \n\"This lifelike creation, inspired by LEGO Designer Mike Psiaki’s amazing sets, will provide LEGO fans of all ages with a fantastic building experience and endless hours of enjoyment!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:22:46.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
