However, all those changes could come with a hefty price tag to boot. \nGiven the advancements and new features Apple is expected to put into the upcoming iPhone 8 , sources speaking with Fast Company reveal the 10th anniversary iPhone could cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $1,000 (about £800/AU$930). \nIt wouldn't actually be too outlandish for an iPhone to cost a grand, as the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus already commands a price of $969 (£919/AU$1,569). \nThat said, it appears the iPhone 8 could step that figure up as the most expensive handset from Apple yet, barring those third-party 24 karat gold iPhones marketed at billionaires. Why might the iPhone 8 be so expensive? \nStill, it's quite a leap to go into quadruple digits for a phone, so what could drive the price up that high? \nSeveral reports claim Apple is looking to use a curved AMOLED screen for the device. While eye-popping and vivid, AMOLED screens could cost Apple twice as much as the LCD screens currently used in its handsets. \nOther improvements, such as increased memory, a new sensing technology , and a better camera , are also rumored, all of which could further bump up the smartphone's production costs. \nWe won't know for sure how much to shell out until Apple gives the word later this year, but we anticipate there being different models to give customers a chance to opt out of more expensive features, similar to the dual-lens camera exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus.
