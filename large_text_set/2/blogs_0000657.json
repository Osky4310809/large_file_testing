The group is the first ERG at Twitter to use the tool, which Twitter launched in November. \nTo chat with the bot, all you have to do is direct message @Blackbirds. From there, the bot will tell you one of four things: a today in #BlackHistory fact, a community event in cities like New York, San Francisco or Atlanta (#ForTheCause), tips on #SelfCare or notable moments and content from prominent black people on Twitter (#ForTheCulture). \nBut based on the way Blackbirds designed the bot, people will only be able to interact via quick replies, as all of the answers have been pre-loaded. If people respond with something racist, the bot won’t recognize it as a valid response. welcome", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T18:10:56.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
