I kept a diary, and I would try to compare, you know, one visit… I kept a diary when I went to visit, and I were comparing what she’d told me that last visit, to this visit, and then, you know, and there was just nothing that I could connect,” says Julie. \nWhen asked if she thinks she’ll ever know the full truth, Julie replies: “I’m not holding my breath.” \nShe later says if she spoke to Karen now, she’d still try to find out all the details of what happened: “I probably would still want answers off of her. I tried for four years, so I don’t rate my chances.” Julie no longer has contact with Karen, under the terms of Karen's release from prison (Photo: Channel 5) The documentary explores Shannon's kidnap (Photo: Channel 5) \nShannon was found drugged and hidden in the base of a divan bed at the home of Michael Donovan, the uncle of Karen's boyfriend Craig Meehan. \nKaren and Donovan were sent to jail for eight years on charges of kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice \nJulie's contact with Karen ended under the terms of her probation. Karen was released from prison in 2012. Donovan had already been released at that stage. \nIn the documentary, Julie admits she has always wondered if there were more people involved in the crime than just Karen and Donovan. \n“I think others were involved. There’s got… others have got to be involved, because like I’ve said before, and I’ll say it again, Karen didn’t have the intelligence, and Donovan, from what the cops have said, he didn’t have the intelligence,” she says.
