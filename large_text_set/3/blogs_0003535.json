While their live shows have mostly stayed strong, their youngest cast member has been notably absent. It turns out that Pete Davidson has been working on his sobriety these past few weeks, and we’re so proud that he decided to open up about it with his fans.\nA few of Davidson’s key characters focused around pot usage, so viewers had a pretty good idea that Davidson did dabble with drugs. However, nobody was clued in as to whether or not Davidson was struggling with it, or simply using it as a punchline . Not only has Davidson, who is only 23, been a key component to the last few seasons of the show, but he’s also known for his stand-up routine, having a Comedy Central special out this past year.\nAccording to Davidson himself, he’s currently sober for the first time in years. Just wanted to let you guys know I'm okay. I know I've kinda been missing, on social media and on the show. I quit drugs and am happy and sober for the first time in 8 years. It wasn't easy, but I got a great girl, great friends and I consider myself a lucky man. I'll always be here for you guys, I promise. Remember to never give up hope because sometimes that's all we got. We are a family and I appreciate all your love and support. It's nice to be back in action ❤️ \nA post shared by Pete Davidson (@petedavidson) on Mar 6, 2017 at 3:48pm PST \n“I quit drugs and am happy and sober for the first time in 8 years. It wasn’t easy, but I got a great girl, great friends and I consider myself a lucky man,” he wrote. “I’ll always be here for you guys, I promise.” Davidson definitely has a great girl — the comedian has been tied to Cazzie David , the daughter of Larry David.\nCouldn't pick one so I went with two. Luckiest guy in the world #babygirl \nA post shared by Pete Davidson (@petedavidson) on Mar 6, 2017 at 6:30pm PST \nWe’re so happy that the cast and crew of Saturday Night Live seem to be incredibly supportive of Pete Davidson and his healthy life change. Sobriety is a beautiful challenge for many, and we definitely wish Davidson the best!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:34:02.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
