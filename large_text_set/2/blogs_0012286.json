To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country. People can really grab that opportunity. He wants to build things. He wants to make bold decisions and be really decisive.” \nNaturally such an opinion can’t be allowed. \nThe blowback was immediate; a boycott of Under Amour was initiated; celebrities like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson slammed him; Steph Curry, the two-time reigning NBA MVP, commented on Plank calling trump an asset, saying he agreed with Plank’s statement “if you remove the ‘et’.” \nUnfortunately, in the face of the attack, Plank caved and backed off his support. He threw out every politically correct mantra that one could pull out. \nPlank wrote in The Baltimore Sun, “In a business television interview last week, I answered a question with a choice of words that did not accurately reflect my intent. I want to clarify to our hometown exactly our values for which Under Armour and I stand.” \nPlank listed the values his company espouses: “We stand firmly for equal rights,” “We believe that immigration is a source of strength, diversity and innovation for global companies based in America like Under Armour,” “Under Armour stands for job creation.” \nHe said they would be opposing the travel ban and taking public positions consistent with human rights. \nHere’s a public position consistent with human rights. \nHow about the ability to hold your own opinion without being bullied into submission? \nHow about that protecting the security of Americans is in fact fully consistent with human rights?
