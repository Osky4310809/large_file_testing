The Midlands of England in particular has got it going on spawning a slew of talented MCs, including Derby’s very own Eyez. He’s one to watch in 2017 according to UK Grime, and we’d have to agree. \nHe started to MC at the age of 11, and he’s been shaking up the game as of late with audacious statement tracks like “‘F**k the Grime Scene.” He recently linked up with photographer Martyn Ewoma for this shoot entitled “underground” – embodying the concept perfectly on a visual and conceptual level. Posing under a motorway intersection called the spaghetti junction, this emerging grime star is well on his way up from Derby’s underground to take on the rest of the world. What was it like growing up in Derby? What was the music scene like? \nGrowing up in Derby was fun, it was hard to get seen in the music scene but everyone was passionate and I think that’s where I got my dedication from. Do you remember the first Grime track you heard? What was that like? \nThe first grime tracks I heard were from Wiley and So Solid Crew, my older brother used to play them in the house. We used to watch Channel U (currently called Channel AKA) religiously. I used to think grime was super cool – with all the noises and sound effects it almost sounded like a computer game. What was it like to be a part of team Derby’s win in the Grime-A-Side competition? \nBeing part of the Derby team was sick. Representing the city means a lot to me, so when we won the Redbull G-A-S it was more than just winning. It was more of a statement letting people know that it doesn’t matter where you’re from, anyone can do anything. What non-Grime artists have made a mark on you? \nMany non grime artists have had an impact on my music. I listen to reggae quite a lot, so Gregory Isaacs, Bob Marley and also the soul & hip hop legend, Lauryn Hill. What was your favourite piece you got to wear on this shoot and why? \nI loved the Stone Island X Supreme trousers, they were just too wavy. What are you excited to wear this Spring? \nI’m excited to wear some cool t-shirts that me and a friend have designed, ‘WoiOi.’ Do you have any pre-show rituals? \nI don’t have any pre- show rituals but I do like to have a glass of pineapple juice just before a performance. Favourite post-show food? \nPizza is always my favourite post-show food. What’s been your favourite collaboration of your career so far? \nMy favourite collab was with Ghettz, who was my favourite grime artist as a teenager. What are your plans for the rest of 2017? \nAs well as the clothing brand I will be launching in April, I also have a lot of music to release this year, I will be doing some international shows, so look out for all of that. \nNeed more grime in your life?
