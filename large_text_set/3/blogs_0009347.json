Close Related: Nicola Sturgeon writes to Theresa May over 'shameful' backtrack on helping child refugees ITN \nNicola Sturgeon caught Westminster off-guard on Monday (13 March) by calling for a second Scottish independence referendum. The first minister of Scotland was expected to make the move at the SNP's spring conference in Glasgow, which starts on Friday (17 March). \nBut with the Article 50 bill set to pass through parliament on Monday evening and Theresa May expected to trigger EU divorce talks on Tuesday, Sturgeon called the media to her official residence of Bute House in Edinburgh. \n\"I can confirm today that next week I will seek the authority of the Scottish Parliament to agree with the UK government the details of a Section 20 Order, the procedure that will enable the Scottish Parliament to legislate for a second Scottish interdependence referendum,\" she said. \n\"The UK government was clear in 2014 that an independence referendum should, in their words, be made in Scotland by the people of Scotland. That is a principle that should be respected today. The detailed arrangements of a referendum, including its timing, must be for the Scottish Parliament to decide.\" \nSturgeon added: \"If Scotland is to have a real choice, when the terms of Brexit are known but before it is too late to choose our own course, then that choice must be offered between the Autumn of next year 2018 and the spring of 2019.\" \nThe comments come after an Ipsos MORI poll for STV News, of more than 1,000 respondents between 24 February and 6 March, found that Scottish people likely to vote were split 50/50 on the independence issue. Scots voted 55% against splitting from the rest of the UK in 2014. \nBut 62% of Scottish voters backed a Remain vote at the EU referendum in June, when the UK voted 52% to 48% to split from the economic and political bloc.
