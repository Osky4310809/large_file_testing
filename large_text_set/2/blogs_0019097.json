QMP dedicated it to Daniel Robles, Ortega’s best friend who became a collateral casualty of gang violence. He had the idea to paint a mural that “talked about the progress we made here in America,” Ortega says. \nShortly after his friend's murder, Ortega got to work on the mural, which is located at the corner of Avenue 61 and Figueroa Street. For two months he hunkered down with fellow artists, reading books and studying historical texts. “It was important that we learned our history adequately,” he said. \nAt approximately 100 by 20 feet, Mexico Tenochtitlan : A Sequence of Time and Culture is one of the largest murals in the area. Despite ongoing efforts to maintain it and keep up with weather damage and tagging — most recently in preparation for a re-dedication celebration to mark the 20th anniversary in March of 2016 — the mural has seen better days.

The worst yet happened in early October 2016. The vandals' writing spanned more than half the width of the mural, beginning at the creation scene, came up to the altar of the Virgin and into the Quetzacoatl, the feathered serpent, and the ocean. “It was respected for a long time, the community loves this mural. Every time they see us working on it, they think of us as superheroes,” says Dominic Ochoa, 37, the youngest original artist. \nBut while the community and local businesses are supportive, the artists feel neglected by local officials. “We don’t have time for politicians to procrastinate and put us on hold,” Ortega says. The mural is in councilmember Gilbert Cedillo’s district, and Ortega says he worked with a field deputy for Cedillo in 2014 who promised to help secure a grant from the Department for Cultural Affairs (DCA). That field deputy is no longer with Cedillo's office, and Will Caperton y Montoya, DCA’s director of marketing and development, wrote in an email that DCA does not currently have any application related to Mexico Tenochtitlan on file. \n“It would be difficult to ascertain what discussions were had,” wrote Fredy Ceja, Cedillo communications director said in an email. \nThe artist’s have little experience securing public funds, but when they began planning the mural in 1995, Ortega secured two major supporters: John Densmore, former drummer of The Doors, and Zack de la Rocha, former vocalist of Rage Against the Machine. Densmore and Ortega met at Self Help Graphics, the Chicano artists' space in Boyle Heights; De la Rocha was his neighbor on Avenue 58 in Highland Park. Together with other private donors, the two musicians provided most of the funding for the original mural. \nNow Ortega says they need at least $20,000 to bring the mural back to its original glory. Frustrated by his experience with obtaining public funds, he's resorting to what he knows works: networking. On a Sunday afternoon in November 2016, Louie Perez from the L.A.-based band Los Lobos drove by the wall and saw Ortega and others at work.
