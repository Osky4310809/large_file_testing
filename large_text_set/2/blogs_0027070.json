By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated:  56 AM The polling for the sixth phase of the elections will take place on March 4. \nThe high-octane campaigning for the Phase 6 of Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017 has begun. The polling for the sixth phase of the elections will take place on March 4. 49 assembly constituencies spanning across 7 districts will go to polls.Meanwhile, an estimated 57.36 per cent of 1.81 crore electorate yesterday cast their votes amid tight security during the fifth phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh with Amethi and Faizabad assembly seats remaining the centre of attention. The day-long poll process remained largely peaceful in 51 Assembly constituencies spread over 11 districts of the state. “57.36 per cent polling was recorded till 5 PM and the figure is likely to go up as several voters waited in queues to exercise their franchise,” UP Chief Electoral Officer T Venkatesh said. Notably, the first four phases of UP polls this time saw voter turnouts of 64 per cent, 65 per cent, 61.16 per cent and 61 per cent respectively. \nMeanwhile personal attacks remained unabated as the ‘donkey’ jibe issue refuses to die down. Prime Minister Narendra Modi again targeted Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh over it today and was joined by Home Minister Rajnath Singh . Modi and Akhilesh also slugged it out over the issue of electricity supply, against the backdrop of the Prime Minister’s allegation of discriminatory distribution by the Samajwadi Party government on the basis of religion. \nAddressing an election rally in Mau in Uttar Pradesh, Modi recalled the ‘donkey’ remark by the Chief Minister and said, “Akhilesh says he has talked about donkeys in fun…I want ask whether the bad state of police stations, people being stabbed and land being grabbed are also a part of fun.” Akhilesh, while addressing a rally last week, had taken an apparent dig at Modi by saying that he would appeal to megastar Amitabh Bachchan not to promote donkeys of Gujarat through a tourism advertisement of the state. Modi had responded to this jibe by saying that Akhilesh should not be afraid of donkeys of Gujarat which are far away. At the same time, Modi had said that donkeys are loyal and hard working animals. Joining Modi in targeting Akhilesh, Rajnath Singh told a press conference in Varanasi that the Chief Minister should not have used such a language against the Prime Minister. “It has pained me that the dignity of the post (of the Prime Minister) was sought to be lowered… It is really unfortunate that such objectionable words were used against the PM, who is not just an individual but an institution in itself, whose dignity we all must maintain,” Singh said. \nOn the other hand Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav claimed the SP- Congress combine is set to form the next government in the state and attributed his confidence to the “the polling trend in the last five phases.”“The polling trends in the five phases of the state drop ample hints that SP-Congress combine is going to form the government in the state,” said the UP CM, while addressing his first joint election rally with Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi at Gorakhpur in eastern UP. Akhilesh said people of the state would reject parties like the BJP and BSP for their “anti-people” policies. “The SP on the other hand is committed to the welfare and development of youngsters,” he said adding his government has already made available land in Gorakhpur for building AIIMS. “But, Prime Minister Narendra Modi must tell when the construction would actually begin,” he said. In his speech, Rahul said, “Congress has entered into an alliance with SP to teach BJP and Modi a lesson.” Claiming that Modi government has done absolutely no work in the last three years of its tenure, Rahul said, “If the Modi government has done even a single work in the last three years, then it must tell people of the country about it.” He alleged that most of the poll promises made by Modi have fallen flat and are yet to see the light of the day. “This includes sending Rs 15 lakh in accounts of each citizen, sending those with black money behind bars and collecting the illegally stashed black money,” he said. \nHere are updates on all Uttar Pradesh phase 6 elections-related events: Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:31:51.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
