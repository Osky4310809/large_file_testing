We have to score goals. \n\"Monaco are a fantastic team. I invite the people to come here and they will see a good game tomorrow. \n\"The best way (to defend) is score goals. When one team scores that many goals and you think about just defending, you kill yourself. City have been challenged to keep on scoring goals (Photo: Getty Images) City came from behind to secure a dramatic victory (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) \n\"The idea is to try and attack. We scored five goals when itâ€™s not easy to score against them.\" \nGuardiola added: \"I am not thinking about being in the semi-finals seven times in a row. I am here to help Manchester City reach the next round. \n\"What I want is tomorrow to make a good game.
