Not even the show's creator or actors know the answer to that yet, and that includes titular star Alexis Bledel . \nBledel addressed the future of \"Gilmore\" during an appearance at the Television Critics Association winter press tour this weekend, telling the assembled journalists that \"A Year in the Life\" was the result of a special set of circumstances. The ball really got rolling on the revival after the cast reunited at the 2015 ATX Fest, the actress explained, and there were two key factors that were necessary for it to come together in the first place -- and would need to happen again should Netflix decide it wants to make more. \n\"I think most of us are just wanting to tell a good story, and I think that came together in 'A Year in the Life,'\" Bledel told the TCA crowd. \"The only thing I can say about a future installment of the show is it would be about the story and certainly the timing.\" \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the actress also \"stressed that there have been no talks about more episodes,\" and told the crowd, \"I haven't heard anything. It hasn't been a conversation as of yet.\" \nFurthermore, Bledel said the decision would have to come down to \"Gilmore\" creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, who carefully shepherded the revival series with some very specific ideas -- like those famous \"final four words\" -- in mind. And that includes any speculation about the identity of ( SPOILER ALERT ) the father of Rory's unborn child, too. \n\"It all lives in Amy's imagination,\" Bledel explained. \"She has a very clear vision and always has.\" \nIt certainly seems like fans want another installment of \"A Year in the Life.\" We'll have to wait and see if Netflix and Sherman-Palladino grant that request.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T05:47:24.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
