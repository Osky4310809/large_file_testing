It's one of the first TV shows that does not depict disability as a tragedy, burden or something to be ashamed of. \nThe American ABC Studios sitcom – about the DiMeo family – has disability as its main theme. Sixteen-year-old JJ has cerebral palsy. He is a wheelchair user and is non-verbal. He communicates with a laser pointer, pointing to a letter board and a partner speaks the words on his behalf. SHARE Speechless is a new sitcom about the DiMeo family which has disability as its main theme. Photo: Network Ten \nSpeechless begins with the family moving house yet again, so JJ can go to a school that allows him to have an education aide. It is their sixth upheaval in two years – this time to a ramshackle house. \nEpisode one introduces accessibility issues (the wheelchair ramp is behind the school, used by the cleaner to transport garbage) and the soft bigotry of low expectations for people with disability (JJ is welcomed to his new class with a standing ovation and a round of applause, is called an inspiration, and is immediately appointed class president). SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Speechless is breaking new ground by casting a disabled actor, Micah Fowler, as the show's main character JJ. Photo: Network Ten \nIn a later episode the sitcom touches on inspiration porn, a concept coined by Stella Young, the late Australian writer, comedian and disability activist. Ray, JJ's younger brother, played by Mason Cook, explains why inspiration porn is problematic for people with disability: \"It's a portrayal of people with disabilities as one-dimensional saints who only exist to warm the hearts and open the minds of able-bodied people,\" he said. \nMicah Fowler, who plays JJ, has a milder form of cerebral palsy than JJ. Some of his real life experiences have been written into the show. Advertisement \nIt's not OK for actors to \"black up\", and nor is is it OK for actors to \"crip up\" (think Sam Claflin in Me Before You and Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking). So it's groundbreaking to cast an actually disabled actor. \nMinnie Driver plays Maya, an overbearing mother who just wants to see her son living his best life. She is pushy, has created an handbook for JJ (one of the lived experiences Fowler had as a child), and is perhaps an accurate representation (bordering on parody) of \"special needs moms\". \nMany in the disability community have responded very positively to the show. \nThough an exaggerated version of an enthusiastic mother, Maya nonetheless captures the overwhelming desire that a parent has for their child to succeed. But through her we understand how much more complex, difficult and gratifying this can be when a child has a disability. \nIt's important that viewers see themselves in TV characters – and I especially hope that disabled people see themselves or their experiences reflected in the show. \nCentring disability, casting a disabled actor as a main character and discussing issues such as access needs and inspiration porn is progressive. It's about time a disabled character dominated the screen. \nSpeechless unapologetically shows the audience that people with disability can have a strong presence on screen. It shows disability in an authentic and humorous light, and I think it will both educate viewers and resonate with people with disability. I also hope it will show TV producers that disabled actors, writers and our stories can be shown in sitcoms. \nSpeechless has not been widely promoted. It's disappointing the clever and witty sitcom is not getting the attention it deserves. Disability is often the forgotten element of diversity. \nIn an era where people's perceptions of disability is often shaped by a viral social media meme, mocking, pitying or heroifying a person with a disability, it's crucial that realistic, humorous and centred depictions of disability are seen. \nCarly Findlay is a writer, speaker and appearance activist.
