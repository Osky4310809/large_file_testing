Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDonald Trump tore up a stack of Barack Obama's environmental protection laws today, promising a future with really clean coal. \nThere's just one problem. \n'Clean coal' doesn't exist. It's a myth invented by lobbyists and PRs employed by fossil fuel companies to make their smoke-belching 18th Century energy source sound shiny and new. \nBut Donald has a dream, that he can revitalise 'big coal' without literally destroying the world in the process. \nHere's how his claims (smoke) stack up. Is there any such thing as clean coal? (Photo: PA) \nNo. \nCoal is coal. It’s dirty, it comes out of the ground and when you burn it it releases damaging carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. \nWhen people talk about ‘clean coal’, they’re really talking about the technology developed to capture the carbon dioxide and store it somewhere. \nDonald Trump scraps Barack Obama's anti-Climate Change rules promising 'really clean coal' \nWhile it’s true that in pilot schemes up to 90% of carbon has been removed from fossil fuel emissions, the technology is super, super expensive. \nCoal production is already more expensive than oil and fracking - and that’s before you ramp up the cost with carbon capture technology. Why would energy companies want to pay for expensive carbon capture technology when they can frack for gas much more cheaply? \nThat’s an excellent question, which can be - in part - answered with another question. \nIf Trump really wanted to encourage coal companies to spend money cleaning up coal, why would he dismantle the environmental regulations? \nThe answer to both questions is “they don’t”. And while we're on damage to the environment... (Photo: AFP) \nIt’s worth remembering CO2 isn’t the only damage coal does to the planet. \nStrip mining coal leaves huge scars on the landscape - and entire Appalachian mountain peaks have been knocked into valleys in West Virginia to get to the coal underneath.

You know those hasy pictures of Beijing? That’s from coal. \nAcross the world, thousands of people die mining coal every year - and more than a million are thought to die prematurely because of air pollution in China alone. Is coal even a thing any more? (Photo: REUTERS) \nNot really. \nAccording to an Energy Department analysis released in January, coal mining now accounts for fewer than 70,000 US jobs. \nBy contrast, renewable energy - including wind, solar and biofuels - now accounts for more than 650,000 US jobs. Anyway, I thought Donald Trump was an ‘environment guy’? \nHe says he is. A lot. But he’s not. \nWhen he first announced his plan to scrap environmental regulations, within days of his inauguration, he said: “I’m a very big person when it comes to the environment, I’ve won awards on the environment but some of that stuff makes it impossible to get anything built.” \nMr Trump has claimed repeatedly to have been given environmental awards since 2011. The only award anyone’s been able to find so far was a 2007 prize he was given by the Metropolitan Golf Association Foundation for including a nature trail on his golf club in New Jersey. Read More \nA few years later he was fined by the state of New Jersey for repeated violations of environmental laws. \nOh, and in 2012, he said climate change was a ‘hoax’ invented by China. \nMeanwhile, he appointed Scott Pruitt, a man with close ties to the oil industry, and who has repeatedly sued the Environmental Protection Agency…to run the Environmental Protection Agency.
