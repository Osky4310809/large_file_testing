Share it! 324 Shares \nMr. Sam Snow told a group of passengers that John Elway was his favorite NFL quarterback of all time, not realizing a certain someone was in his car. \nHint: It was John Elway. The Washington D.C. cab driver had no idea he was driving John Elway around when his passengers asked him about his favorite QBs of all time. via: Facebook \nHe wore a jacket covered in Super Bowl patches, so the group in the back of his car, which just so happened to include John Elway, struck up a conversation about football. \nSnow immediately listed John Elway as his number one pick for the best NFL quarterback ever, but he had absolutely no clue that Elway was in his backseat! When the group finally asked Snow to turn around, he immediately recognized Elway and totally freaked. \nHe asked for a picture, which Elway happily agreed to, and repeated, “C’mon man, are you serious?!” while shaking the football legend’s hand. \nThe video is hilarious, heartwarming, and adorable all at the same time. And of course, it quickly went viral once it was posted on Facebook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T07:20:50.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
