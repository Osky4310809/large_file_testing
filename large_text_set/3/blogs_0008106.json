It's not going Pogba's way this season? (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"He will become a brilliant midfielder; there is no doubt in that. \n\"I think he scored seven or eight goals, again, not many midfielders at 23 will do that... but because he cost so much, he is compared with that price tag when actually, he has done okay this season. \n\"Okay, not brilliant but not really bad. So yeah, I think a lot people should cut him a bit of slack.\" poll loading Is Paul Pogba worth £89million? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T21:59:40.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
