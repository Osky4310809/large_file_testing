Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMinisters will be handed the power to change hundreds of laws without full scrutiny from parliament under Theresa May’s Brexit ‘Great Repeal Bill’. \nThe sprawling bill will convert all EU laws into UK legislation, meaning they can be changed after Brexit . \nThe Government is set to publish their plan for the bill on Thursday, the day after the Prime Minister invokes Article 50 . \nBut the bill is likely to grant ministers a time-limited power to change EU laws through the use of so-called Henry VIII clauses. \nThis would allow Theresa May’s top team to make changes to the hundreds of laws that will be imported from Europe using secondary legislation. (Photo: REUTERS) \nSecondary legislation can be ‘waved through’, often without even being debated in the House of Commons. \nThe Government argues it needs the power as a significant proportion of existing EU law will not work properly without changes being made, so ministers must be given the ability to make \"technical\" changes quickly. \nOne example could be if an EU regulation refers to a regulatory body that will not apply to Britain after it leaves, and so the name will need to be changed. \nMajor policy changes, such as new immigration or customs controls, will be brought forward under normal parliamentary Bills and subject to full scrutiny. \nThe Henry VIII powers will end at a time spelled out in the legislation by a \"sunset clause\" and will also be handed to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland so they can correct laws that that will come under the remit of the devolved administrations. \nA Government source said: \"Next week will mark a defining moment in this country's history, when the Prime Minister invokes Article 50 and opens the way for formal negotiations to leave the European Union and build a truly global Britain.

That, more than anything else, was what drove the referendum result: a desire for the country to be in control of its own destiny. \n\"So next week we will get on with the job, and set out the steps we will take to ensure control of our laws lies in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.\" Read More \nThe House of Lords Constitution Committee earlier this month acknowledged that the Government may have to use Henry VIII powers to adapt existing EU law to fit the UK's framework and to respond swiftly to the Brexit negotiations.
