Search Income Investing2 February 22, 2017, 1:19 P.M. ET A $20 Trillion National Debt: Trouble Ahead? By Johanna Bennett \nAlmost a month ago, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its 20,000 milestone . Now another “20” is looming ahead. Any day now, the U.S. will surpass $20 trillion in total public debt — or as it is commonly called, “the national debt.” Getty Images \nIt’s a truly vast number. Over the past 20 years, then national debt has quadrupled, far outstripping the rate of growth of the U.S. economy to become the biggest pile of debt in the world. Thanks to low interest rates, the cost of maintaining that debt has fallen compared to overall Fed spending over the same time period. \nOf that $20 trillion, $14.4 trillion is held by the public, and nearly half of that sum in the hands of foreign investors such as the Japanese and Chinese governments. But China and Japan have both recently cut their exposure to U.S. Treasuries , fueling worries of a major drop in bond prices. \nBut there’s another sticky issue, namely rising interest rates, says Andrew Tanzer of Gerstein Fisher , a New York advisory firm. \nWe do not make any specific predictions, but it does seem prudent for investors to be prepared for potentially higher volatility in bond markets, stemming from the strong possibility of the confluence of rising rates, higher US government debt levels, and much higher annual interest expenses in the federal budget, which could change investors’ perception of Treasuries and risk. For our elected officials, burgeoning interest payments would require some tough decisions on government spending programs. \nTanzer goes into more detail: \nThe days of a low interest-rate environment, with 10-year US Treasury bonds yielding 2% or less and the government able to service $20 trillion of debt with a relatively manageable portion of the total budget may soon be in the past. Interest rates are rising (the yield on 10-year Treasuries rose by 70 basis points to 2.47% in the year to February 16, 2017), and the market’s expectation for the Trump Presidency is for higher economic growth, inflation and interest rates, which could dramatically change the current equilibrium. \n…The CBO projects that debt held by the public will increase from $15 trillion at the end of 2017 to $25 trillion by 2027, largely due to swelling budget deficits. This would raise the public debt/GDP ratio from 77% to 89%, which the CBO notes would be the highest level since 1947 and more than twice the average over the past five decades in relation to GDP. \nFor its ten-year projection, the CBO assumes economic growth and inflation rates of about 2% and a rise in interest rates on the 10-year Treasury from 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 3.6% in the latter part of the next decade. It estimates that the combination of rising interest rates and growing federal debt held by the public will cause government interest payments on that debt to nearly triple in nominal terms and almost double relative to GDP. The CBO thinks rising interest payments will lead to a drop in government discretionary spending from 6.3% of GDP in 2017 to 5.3% by 2027, the smallest ratio since comparable data was kept from 1962. \nThe CBO scenario projection doesn’t need to be exactly right to observe the substantial risk of much higher debt-servicing costs in the federal budget. A one-percentage point rise in rates now implies a $200 billion annual increase in interest payments, and more in future years as the stock of outstanding debt expands from $20 trillion. The question of how sustainable this level of debt is for the United States is complicated somewhat by the use of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency, and by the extensive and intensive use of US Treasuries as a highly liquid, low-risk investment by banks, funds, and governments around the world. There are many possible scenarios, but one is the possibilty of a “negative feedback loop,” wherein rising interest rates increase the cost of US debt to the government, shaking the confidence of investors that the debt level is sustainable and causing them to sell their US bonds, further driving up rates.
