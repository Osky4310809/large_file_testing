It’s being referenced in Lamar’s song.\nRussell Westbrook on getting mentioned on Kendrick's new song: pic.twitter.com/DIL64V0tZz \n— ㅤ (@GoatRapLines) March 26, 2017 “Yeah. K-Dot’s my man,” said Westbrook, when asked if he liked the new song. “Yes sir. That’s my guy, representing the west coast so I love it.\n“I was surprised, I’m happy. You know whenever you hear your name in a song, you feel like you made it. I feel like I made it.”\nThe West Coast rapper dropped a new track last week, referencing the breakup between Westbrook and ex-teammate Kevin Durant . \nLamar raps:\nTables turned, lesson learned, my best look/You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook/Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you/ \nJust know the next game played, I might slap the s... out you/ \nDurant left the Oklahoma City Thunder for the Golden State Warriors during free agency last summer. It was the Warriors who came back from a 3-1 deficit to eliminate the Thunder in last year’s Western Conference Finals.\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:25:53.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
