The former aides, identified as former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former foreign policy adviser Carter Page, and outside adviser Roger Stone, have all denied being in contact with Kremlin officials during the campaign. \nStone and Manafort have denied ever being in contact with Kremlin officials. \nThe White House has called the reports “garbage.” \nAccording to CNN, Priebus and McCabe discussed the news reports following a White House meeting the day after they were published. \nA White House official disputed that account, according to CNN. The official said that McCabe called Priebus earlier that day saying that the Times report “vastly overstates what the FBI knows about the contacts.” \nCNN adds: \n“The White House official said that Priebus later reached out again to McCabe and to FBI Director James Comey asking for the FBI to at least talk to reporters on background to dispute the stories. A law enforcement official says McCabe didn’t discuss aspects of the case but wouldn’t say exactly what McCabe told Priebus.” \nComey refused the request to talk to reporters on background because of the ongoing investigation, a law enforcement official told CNN. \nDays after the supposed request, Priebus said in Sunday talk show interviews that he had been informed by the “top levels of the intelligence community” that the stories were “grossly overstated and inaccurate and totally wrong.” \nA Justice Department memo from 2009 says that the White House and FBI should only be in contact regarding pending criminal investigations when it is required for the president’s duties. Otherwise, contact should only occur between the White House and top officials at the Justice Department. \n“Initial communications between the [Justice] Department and the White House concerning pending or contemplated criminal investigations or cases will involve only the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, from the side of the Department, and the Counsel to the President, the Principal Deputy Counsel to the President, the President, or the Vice President from the side of the White House,” the memo reads, according to CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:50:50.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
