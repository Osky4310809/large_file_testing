Colmes, who was one half of \"Hannity and Colmes\" for 13 years, was remembered by his sparring partner and friend Sean Hannity in a sweet tribute on Thursday. \n“He was not only a guy with the greatest sense of humor but a guy that had a human level of decency and love and kindness and humor” Hannity said about Colmes. \nNot everyone was so kind. Slate magazine, an outlet known for its liberal viewpoints, unthinkably used the opportunity to smear Colmes as a coward. \n“Colmes was the most absurd, useless, and mocked television personality in America for many years, precisely because he was nice,” Slate’s Isaac Chotiner wrote. \"In the context of Fox News, being a nice guy — and a “liberal” nice guy at that — meant being a buffoon, and a patsy. Colmes not only played the part to perfection — he defined it.” \nHannity, shocked at the cruelty, had some words of his own for the magazine. Only mean soulless assholes could ever write and print something this viscious, cruel, and heartless. You r so ignorant, wrong, and hateful! https://t.co/u06wk1ytoT — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 24, 2017 \nHannity followed up that tweet with additional notes for Slate, wondering how they could write something so repulsive as Colmes' family was grieving. \nWe couldn't have said it much better, Sean. \nRIP, Alan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:56:25.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
