Syracuse announced that Boeheim has signed an extension on Sunday. \nJim Boeheim's contract extended beyond 2017-18, Adrian Autry & Gerry McNamara on @Cuse_MBB staff: https://t.co/ASI45Z0DTn pic.twitter.com/PpT9oBRSTa \n— Syracuse Athletics (@Cuse) March 19, 2017 This is a departure from the original plan. In 2015, the Orange made the peculiar decision to announce that Boeheim would retire, but that he wouldn’t do it for three years. This was in the wake of NCAA sanctions handed down due to academic impropriety and failing to comply with school drug policies, among other things .\nThe sanctions cost Boeheim 108 victories on the NCAA's official career total, dropping from 966 to 858 and from No. 2 all-time (trailing only Duke's Mike Krzyzewski) to No. 6. A New York native, Boeheim played guard for the Orange from 1962-66, returning to the school as an assistant coach in 1969 after a brief professional career. He was promoted to head coach in 1976, leading the team to four Final Four appearances, one national championship and eight Big East regular season titles.\nBut what complicates things is the fact that Boeheim’s coach-in-waiting, Mike Hopkins, took the Washington job recently. \nHere's #Syracuse AD John Wildhack on today's moves and extending Jim Boeheim's contract.

He’s excited about it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T01:59:50.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
