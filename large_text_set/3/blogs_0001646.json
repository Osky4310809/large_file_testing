Claire McCaskill sends heads to desks explaining why she wasn’t ‘precise’ Posted at 4:24 pm on March 2, 2017 by Doug P. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nEarlier today, after Sen. Claire McCaskill claimed that she’d never met, in-person meeting or by phone, with the Russian ambassador. It didn’t take long for McCaskill’s own tweets to disprove her claim . Now the Missouri senator’s saying she couldn’t be as concise as she should have been because of… Twitter’s character limit: McCaskill blamed Twitter limit on her tweet. \"140 characters are tough. The word 'from' should have been in there but I didn't have room.\" \n— Ashley Killough (@KilloughCNN) March 2, 2017 McCaskill clarifies to @KilloughCNN : She never met \"one-on-one\" with the Russian ambassador; says Twitter limit didn't let her be precise \n— Manu Raju (@mkraju) March 2, 2017 \nApparently sometimes the truth can’t fit into 140 characters or less. \"I didn't have enough characters to tell the truth\" is a new one. Imma try that https://t.co/ZhKDUlEv8O \n— Logan Dobson (@LoganDobson) March 2, 2017 @KilloughCNN @baseballcrank \"I tried to make a technically true but misleading statement but had to leave out the technically true part\" \n— Josiah Neeley (@jneeley78)   Oopsie! Up to 30 Democrats should resign for meeting with Russian diplomats in 2015 \nHere’s how McCaskill tried to clarify her earlier tweet. Notice how things have evolved slightly: Again, As senior member of Armed Serv, never received call or request from Russian Amb for meeting. Never met one on one w/him. \n— Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) March 2, 2017 4 years ago went to meeting of many Senators about international adoptions. Russian Amb also attended. \n— Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) March 2, 2017 \nKeep digging! Weird, @clairecmc , how this went from \"meeting with\" to \"also attended,\" isn't it? Guess facts are malleable based on your political need. pic.twitter.com/VBHXd7pywZ \n— Derek Hunter (@derekahunter) March 2, 2017 @clairecmc So you lied in your original tweet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:16:59.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
