His baritone is rich and lackadaisical as Adam Green's red-wine warm tones. Created in California (he currently resides in Brooklyn) and christened Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams, the 28-year-old's LP is a pretty surprising collection redolent in trysts and tangled sheets, seduction and broken promises. Oh, and private planes. There are plush strings and muted brass and retro organ licks. It's a playboy's record, but this playboy has a heart. \nAhead of the record's release this Friday, we're premiering his video for \"Dance With Me,\" which stars his close gal pal, style maven, and entrepreneur Alexa Chung. It is a marvelously-lit little short, which kicks off in the most dramatic of ways: with Chung dead on the asphalt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:21:18.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
