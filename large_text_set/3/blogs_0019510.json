The first trailer for the upcoming movie adaptation “Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie” is finally here, and it’s packed with all the goofiness and fun of the original book series. \nCheck out the trailer below. \nIn case you forgot the premise of “Captain Underpants” (and the trailer didn’t already explain it enough), it’s about two fourth-grade boys who hypnotize their cruel principal into becoming their fearless and kind comic book creation Captain Underpants. \nAnd you probably caught all those famous voices in that trailer as well! The voice cast is pretty much a comedy-lover’s dream, with Ed Helms as the elastic-banded superhero, and Kevin Hart and Thomas Middleditch as the troublemaking protagonists George and Harold, respectively. \nThere’s also Nick Kroll , playing the villainous Professor Poopypants. 'Learning so much': Kevin Hart gushes about Bryan Cranston   \nNot heard from in this first trailer is Melvin, George and Harold’s fourth grade nemesis, who will be voiced by Jordan Peele , and the lunch lady Edith, whom Kristen Schaal will voice. \nThankfully, we won’t have to wait that long for the movie to come out! “Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie” is hitting theaters in just two and a half months on June 2. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:48:26.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
