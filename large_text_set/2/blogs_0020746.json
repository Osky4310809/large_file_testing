Kylah Benes-Trapp \nIt’s kind of relaxing to see your whole personality wrapped up in one simple word (or maybe I’m just being “The Perfectionist” about this), but the cool thing about the Enneagram personality test is, it’s a model of interconnected personality types, meaning there’s a little of each of them in all of us. \nOnce you’ve taken the Enneagram test , a whole world of information opens up to you, including the ways in which you work, communicate and even fall in love. \nHere’s an outline of all the Enneagram personality types and the kind of partner your primary type needs in a relationship: #1: The Perfectionist \nBeing a perfectionist is difficult mostly because as a perfectionist, you make it so. In love, you require a lot of reassurance that you are appreciated just for being yourself. You need this reassurance like you need food or water simply because you’re so hard on yourself. \nYou’re most likely to be attracted to someone who values your good advice and who takes on their share of the work in the relationship. \nYou don’t want to end up doing it all yourself, and you wouldn’t allow that sort of unhealthy dynamic to exist in any of your relationships. \nYou are a perfectionist, after all. \nThe beneficial side of being in a partnership with a perfectionist is, they are more willing to forgive than their name would suggest. \nAlthough, they won’t do so without a good heartfelt and well-structured apology. #2: The Helper \nHelpers are nurturing, concerned with the wellbeing of others and sensitive to people’s needs, making them extremely supportive romantic partners. \nAs a Helper type, you tend to focus more on others than you do on yourself, and romantically, you need someone who can remind you that YOU matter, too.

So, having a partner who is proud to be seen with you and reassures you of that will do wonders for you. #3: The Achiever \nAchievers are real work horses. They are energetic, goal-oriented and self-assured. \nYou need a partner who is independent enough to leave you alone while you focus on your work and who has a peaceful disposition. \nAnyone who burdens you with emotional drama is going to get the boot very quickly. \nAlbert Einstein’s wife used to leave his dinner outside of his room so that she wouldn’t disturb him in the middle of his work. \nEventually, the marriage dissipated because he felt it interrupted his studies, which basically describes the extreme version of the Achiever. \nThey’re not the easiest people to be with. \nYou constantly are worried about not achieving the kind of success you’d like to achieve in the world, and you need someone who can tell you how proud they are of your accomplishments. \nUltimately, you need someone who is just as focused on their own success. #4: The Romantic \nRomantics have sensitive feelings and are gifted with good intuition. They’re able to find meaning in even the most difficult of life’s challenges, and they tend to be creative thinkers with a tendency toward melancholy. \nAs a Romantic, you need a partner who is lighthearted enough to avoid the pitfalls of your depressive moods, since you don’t always want to come out of them. You’ll benefit by being with someone who doesn’t “go there” with you.

It takes a LOT of effort for them to put their thoughts into words in the first place. \nIf you happen to be the partner of an Observer, also known as “The Thinkers,” remember that if they seem aloof, they are most likely uncomfortable. \nThey need the time and space to process their emotions, so don’t try to pull anything out of them. They’ll come to you when they’re ready. #6: The Questioner \nAlso known as “The Skeptic,” Questioners’ personalities range from introverted and cautious to extroverted and confrontational. \nBut, they are consistently trustworthy, responsible, and loyal to their friends and family. \nIf you’re a Questioner, you need someone who won’t react to your overreactions and anxiety. \nYou’re most likely to be well-matched with someone who will work through things with you, as you need to talk things out as you weigh the pros and cons of every situation. \nSince you struggle with having confidence in yourself, you procrastinate often. \nSo, you need the gentle and optimistic nudge toward new experiences from someone who reminds you that, in the words of Wayne Gretzky, “You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take.” #7: The Adventurer \nAdventurers are lively and optimistic people who are eager to make a contribution to the world. \nAs children, they look forward to the kind of freedom they’ll have as adults, and they will not accept that freedom being compromised once they get there.

You’re a stimulating conversationalist, and you need someone who can keep up. \nYour ideal partner will be someone who respects your independence, who doesn’t feel the need to keep tabs on you and who doesn’t cling to you in any way. #8: The Leader \nLeaders are direct, outspoken, upfront and in charge. They don’t appreciate being told what to do or having their plans compromised. \nThey meet challenges head-on, and they’re unafraid of being honest, even when it’s difficult. \nThey often speak in a very assertive way, and they need someone who won’t automatically assume that it’s a personal attack. \n“I’m not angry, I’m PASSIONATE!” is a common phrase for Leaders. \nWhen you scream, curse, yell and stomp around, you need someone who understands that’s just the way you are. \nYou also need someone who acknowledges and sees your vulnerable, tender side. #9: The Peacemaker \nPeacemakers are receptive listeners, supportive and good-natured, but they’re terrified of confrontation. They have a tendency to be people-pleasers. \nIt can be difficult to be a people-pleaser, as they are often judged for being indecisive or lacking initiative. \nThey can also be a little too sensitive, taking even things like body language personally. So, they need someone who will be aware of this. \nFor those with a more Leader-like personality, it may seem like being with a Peacemaker would be a tough job, but the truth is, Peacemakers have an uncanny ability to acknowledge all sides of an issue. \nThey can also take responsibility for their own actions with greater ease than other types. \nThey make fantastic partners as they’re always able to go with the flow, and they are pretty much down for whatever. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
