It will help more than the one person asking. It will not immediately be irrelevant. \nIn contrast, here are some examples of questions that don’t generally get answered: “If you had $100 and six months, how would you turn it into $10,000 or $100,000, etc.?” “If there were one particular home business opportunity where I could make $2,000 additional per month, what would you suggest?” \nIf I had the magical answer to either of these, I’d use it for myself! And if there were an answer to share with one of you, I’d share it with my whole audience — which diminishes its usefulness as a competitive edge considerably. \nWithout further ado, here are the questions I’m answering this time around.
