Left for dead: Victim Sarah Bermingham \nThey were both thrown into the air by the collision, with Ms Bermingham taking the full impact of the crash which left her crushed beneath the front wheels. \nPolice are hunting the driver of the dark coloured car, which sped off along Wandsworth Plain leaving both women bleeding in the road. \nMs Bermingham told the Standard: “I remember hearing screams and then trying to convince myself that the hit wasn’t as bad as it was. School friends: Sarah Bermingham, left, and Fiona Mateer \n“I was concerned for Fiona but couldn’t register what was going on, the amount of chaos and how much blood was forming around me. \n“I was in a state of shock and panic.” \nMs Mateer, a mortgage consultant based in the City, who suffered minor injuries added: “All I remember is stepping out on to the road and everyone behind us screaming. By that point there was nothing I could do, I couldn’t react quickly enough.” \n“I was in shock because I thought Sarah had died - there was so much blood.” \nPassers-by stopped to warn oncoming traffic of the accident as they gave the two women first aid in the road. \nMs Mateer, 28, said: “A girl lay down on the floor with me and put me in the recovery position and kept talking to me, my friends weren’t allowed to come near or move me.” Crash victim: Sarah Bermingham was left critically injured \nMs Bermingham remains in a south London trauma ward after undergoing major head surgery in intensive care. \nScans showing two breaks in her vertebrae narrowly missed her spinal cord. She was also left with bruising on her brain, a punctured lung and liver damage. Woman fighting for life after car ploughs into two pedestrians \nDoctors were stunned that the Dublin born gymnast had managed to survive her critical injuries. \nThey told her family, who rushed to be at her bedside from a holiday in Spain, that her fitness and health had contributed to her recovery. \nMs Bermingham added: “The driver must have been shocked and panicked, and that’s why they drove off, but at the end of the day this has been the most challenging time of my life emotionally and physically. \n“I don’t deserve this and my family don’t deserve to see me like this. I can only hope they do the right thing and come forward. \n“I still have a long road ahead of me. Honestly I don’t know how I’m going to get through it. \n“Everyone has been telling me how brave I am but I haven’t got a choice, I have to take every day as it comes. “Maybe the driver has a daughter and if the shoe was on the other foot maybe they would want someone to be held accountable, or at least know who they are.” \nA Met spokesman said: “The collision occurred outside the Grand Union pub and may have been witnessed by a number of people who were leaving to go home.” \nAnyone with information is asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 020 8543 5157 or via @MetCC.
