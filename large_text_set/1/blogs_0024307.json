The number was 3,216 in 2014. \nThe data also revealed that 145 urgent operations were cancelled twice or more in 2016 – also the highest on record. In 2011, the figure was just 65. \nLabour’s Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Theresa May’s NHS crisis continues, and the problems are worse and more widespread than in previous years. By underfunding and overstretching the NHS, the Tories have pushed health services to the brink.” Read More Surgeons furious at NHS 'cost-cutting' plans to ration hip and knee replacements The number of ops that have been cancelled has increased by 27 per cent (Photo: Getty) \nLib Dem Health Spokesman Norman Lamb said: “The Government’s stubborn refusal to give the NHS emergency funding means record numbers of operations are being cancelled as hospitals face weeks on end of intolerable pressure. \n“This is no longer a winter crisis, it’s a winter catastrophe.” \nAn urgent operation is defined as one that is life-saving, which is needed to save a limb or organ, or where a patient is at risk of dying if their condition is allowed to deteriorate. It can include cancer patients and those needing heart surgery. \nA Number 10 spokesman said: “We have been very clear we recognise that there are significant pressures on the NHS with an ageing and growing population.

The Royal College of Surgeons said there is “no clinical justification” for the plans. \nBut a spokeswoman for Redditch and Bromsgrove CCG said: “If a patient feels that they require this surgery but do not meet these criteria, there is a clear appeals system.” \nDowning Street said these decisions “need to be made by medics”.
