What an amazing product the fine folks over at Hyperdyne Labs have crafted. It’s a cornhole table, but it is in the form of the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin. You are in the trench run scene from Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope , but instead of proton torpedoes you are armed with bean bags. If you sink your bean bag in the thermal exhaust port it sets off a series of Star War s-y sound effects, actual dialogue from the movie, and lights to simulate the destruction of the Death Star. \nThere are over 120 sounds on the cornhole table so it doesn’t get repetitive, including 10 different win and lose sequences, and over 70 lines from the pilots. \nCurrently, they are working on logistics to make the boards. Which may include giving Disney and Lucasfilm a large cut of the profits. \nCheck out all the cool gizmos that Hyperdyne Labs offers HERE .\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/hyperdynelabs/videos/?ref=page_internal \nVia Img \n\n[ LaughingSquid ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T04:34:10.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
