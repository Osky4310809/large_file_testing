Loftus-Cheek, who had a long-range shot tipped over, next snatched at a chance, firing straight at Bentley. \nBrentford had opportunities either side of halftime. Yoann Barbet struck a volley at Begovic and the goalkeeper pounced to repel the danger as Vibe hesitated after John Terry’s slip. \nChelsea’s third finally came when Pedro ran down the right and fed the overlapping Ivanovic. media_camera Chelsea players celebrate Branislav Ivanovic’s goal. \nThe Serbia right-back opted to power the ball low into the near corner before being enveloped by his teammates. \nIvanovic, who has won every major club honour since his January 2008 arrival from Lokomotiv Moscow, was then fouled by Barbet and Batshuayi converted the resulting spot kick in an emphatic win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T00:42:04.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
