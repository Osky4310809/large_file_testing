Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch, face tough senate confirmation \nRepublicans, who control Congress, have praised Gorsuch, 49, as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice. \nChuck Grassley, the panel’s Republican chairman, asked Gorsuch “whether you’d have any trouble ruling against a president who appointed you.” \n“That’s a softball, Mr Chairman,” Gorsuch said. \n“I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and facts in the particular case require. \n“I’m heartened by the support I have received from people who recognise that there’s no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have judges in this country.” \nInspite of slim chances of blocking his nomination in the Republican-led Senate, Democrats have raised questions about Gorsuch’s suitability for the job. \n“I have offered no promises on how I’d rule in any case to anyone. \n“I don’t think it’s appropriate for a judge to do so, no matter who’s doing the asking. \n“I don’t, because everybody wants a fair judge to come to their case with an open mind and to decide it on the facts and the law,” Gorsuch told the committee. \nGorsuch, wearing a navy blue suit and a purple tie, shook hands with supporters and senators as he arrived in the committee room. \nGrassley said the hearing could last about 10 hours, with all the committee members getting to question him. \nBefore the hearing resumed on Tuesday, about 60 Gorsuch supporters rallied on the sidewalk outside the Senate office building, many from a student anti-abortion movement carrying signs saying, “We don’t need Planned Parenthood,” referring to the women’s healthcare provider that performs abortions. \nIn his opening statement to the panel on Monday, Gorsuch defended his judicial record, emphasising the need for “neutral and independent judges to apply the law.” \nDemocrats outlined their lines of attack in their opening statements on Monday, with some senators saying they would press him on whether he is independent enough from Trump, who has condemned federal judges who have put on hold his two executive orders to ban the entry into the United States of people from several Muslim-majority countries. \nGorsuch will also face questioning over cases he has handled on the appeals court in which corporate interests won out over individual workers. \nIf Gorsuch is confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he would restore a narrow five to four conservative court majority. The seat has been vacant for 13 months, since the death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia. \nThe court’s ideological leaning could help determine the outcome of cases involving the death penalty, abortion, gun control, environmental regulations, transgender rights, voting rights, immigration, religious liberty, presidential powers and more. \nRepublicans hold 52 of the Senate’s 100 seats. Under present rules, Gorsuch would need 60 votes to secure confirmation. \nIf Gorsuch cannot muster 60, Republicans could change the rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:52:28.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
