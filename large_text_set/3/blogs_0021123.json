The air carrier’s latest custom craft is one of its Star Wars series of planes, commemorating everyone’s favorite golden protocol droid with a C-3PO yellow fuselage wrap, and interior decorating to match. \nThe C-3PO ANA Jet follows R2-D2 and BB-8 variants released previously, and while those two were relatively easy to convey since a jet’s body is roughly equivalent to those droids lying on their sides, the humanoid C-3PO required a bit more creative license. A focus on that trademark midsection C-3PO enjoys, with its exposed wiring and large circular sternum detail, proved the most effective way to translate his essential droidness onto a gigantic passenger jet. 479a969551627278697513dc836a2b16", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:18:34.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
