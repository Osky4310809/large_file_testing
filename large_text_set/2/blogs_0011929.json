And you will too.\nIf you let me hold your hand through this.\nI am not going to tell you to distract yourself.\nTo eat healthy, to exercise.. to let it go.\nThat drinking is the worst thing you can do when you’re in that state.\nIn fact.. I encourage you to feel it.\nTo drink and smoke and feel it all.\nAnd fuck it, I will smoke with you.\nI encourage you to break down, and fall to the floor.\nI will tell you this because in my experience, it was the only way that I made it back up.\nYou will smash to pieces and I will be there to help you put you back together.\nIt will take time, there will be pieces missing, but there will be new pieces found along the way.\nPieces that you could not get, without getting through this moment.\nI will understand that it’s a process that cannot be forced.\nThat soon you will want to breathe, want to walk and want to run.\nYou will want to be healthy and you will feel strong again.\nI will not tell you that everything happens for a reason.\nBecause I know, that in time, you will have this realisation yourself.\nIf you’d let me be there, one day it will all make sense.\nI will tell you that it really does just take time.\nBut I will understand that in that moment, those words don’t help.\nI will not force you, but I will be there when you need me for however long it takes.\nWe can listen to your favourite sad songs and you can play those songs on repeat.\nYou can reminisce and tell me every story over and over until I can recite them all myself.\nIf you’d let me, I could be your diary.\nI could hold you while you shake and be there when you break.\nAnd If you’d let me show you how I see you, I promise you will save yourself. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T23:01:10.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
