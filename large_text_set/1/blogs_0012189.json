On the day that average hits its lowest, we’ve hit the “bottom of the well.”\nRelated: Canada is in the midst of a rough flu season and the worst is yet to come \nEverything you need to know about this year’s flu season \n“Then it begins its slow, relentless rise to what we call the dog days of summer, which is the warmest moment statistically.”\nBecause average temperatures vary across the country, the dead of winter will hit different areas on different days. Residents of British Columbia have already turned the corner, while the dead of winter comes to the rest of the Prairies this week.\nThe Maritimes hit rock bottom in early February and Iqaluit has to wait until Feb. 11 for the turning point.\n“It’s not as if winter is over by a long shot,” Phillips said. “We’ve just hit the halfway point, but the good news is ... the flow seems to be coming more from the Pacific than the Arctic.”\nAlthough there are no records being set in Western Canada, Phillips said it has been a tough year for the four western provinces.\nVancouver has received twice as much snow as normal and recorded 30 days where temperatures were below normal — double the average of 15.\n“It has been persistently cold for that period,” said Phillips. “In fact, if you look at the average temperature in December, the last time there was a colder December was 1990. That was more than 25 years ago. It was a bit of a shocker.”\nWinnipeg received a record snowfall for the month of December, while Calgary has suffered freezing temperatures and heavy snow.\nThis winter in Western Canada follows one of the warmest years on record in 2015 and, in many jurisdictions, winter was essentially cancelled last year, he said.\nCanadians tend to base their weather expectations on the winter before, so this season has come as a shock to many, Phillips said.\n“It’s like a punch in the face. Clearly, when you look at the temperatures, certainly the amount of snow, the number of cold days — if you’re whining, it’s not without cause. It has been tough.”\nPhillips said Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces have been slightly warmer than average, but with more precipitation in the form of rain and snow.\nHere’s when the dead of winter arrives in some cities across Canada:\nVictoria — Jan. 3\nVancouver — Jan.4\nKelowna — Jan. 6\nCalgary — Jan. 12\nRegina — Jan. 13\nEdmonton — Jan. 14\nOttawa — Jan. 19\nMontreal — Jan. 21\nToronto — Jan. 23\nHalifax — Feb. 2\nSt. John’s, NL — Feb. 8\nIqaluit — Feb. 11", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T05:10:45.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
