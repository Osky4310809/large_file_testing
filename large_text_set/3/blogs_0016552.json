And many people don’t want their employers to know they don’t have a home.” Read More Sickening footage shows killer throwing petrol over sleeping homeless man and burning him alive The tragedy has highlighted the plight of the region’s ‘hidden homeless’ (Photo: MEN) \nJonathan says Mr Roseblade’s death highlights how quickly people can become homeless and find themselves in a vulnerable position. \n“Really we would like to highlight how homelessness can affect anyone,” he adds. \n“David’s death is particularly tragic because he was a hard-working, very pleasant man who had the rest of his life ahead of him.” \nMr Roseblade’s van had been parked on the Asda car park since 4pm on the Friday before his death on March 3. \nIt is not known how the fire started inside the vehicle. Fire investigators are still investigating the tragedy, with one line of enquiry that smoking materials may have been to blame.
