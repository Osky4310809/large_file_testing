For some, coffee is all that’s on tap for breakfast since that’s all they have time for. If only there were some mixture of the two that you could take in on the go. Japan does it again, this time with a new product in the works called coffee butter , a spread that’s flavored like coffee that you can slather all over your toast, bread, pancakes, waffles and other breakfast items.\nThe product is called Snow Brand Coffee Soft, with “soft” being a name given to Japanese spreads that resemble butter, and it’s launching on March 1 in celebration of the 55th anniversary of Megmilk Snow Brand’s coffee drink. Megmilk Snow Brand is one of Japan’s largest dairy companies, and as such the coffee butter will feature the same flavor as its coffee drink, one of the most popular in the entirety of Japan. It’s a cold coffee drink, and though I’ve never had it I assume it probably tastes similar to something like a Starbucks coffee drink you can get in the glass bottles or a similar branded coffee product.\nThe butter sounds like a delicious alternative to grabbing a coffee on the way to work and is said to have “sweet and mellow milky undertones,” so it probably won’t be a huge smack of coffee right in your face or anything, and it will be relatively cheap at 230 yen a pack. So if you’re in Japan and needing a hit of caffeine with your breakfast, you might want to pick some of this up and revel in its delicious caffeinated coffee taste. Then make sure you send your friends at Geek a box because that’s the right thing to do.
