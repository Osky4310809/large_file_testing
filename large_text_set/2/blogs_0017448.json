We‚Äôre talking hundreds of dollars off the Samsung Galaxy S7 ($313 off) or Galaxy S7 Edge ($419 off) or LG V20 ($409 off). In fact, you can have any of those phones for just $360 total, or $15 per month for 24 months. \nAs far as we can tell, there isn‚Äôt a bill credit involved here. Instead, T-Mobile is just giving you a straight up mega-discount on those three phones in particular. In order to get the deal, though, you do have to have a ‚Äúqualifying‚Äù plan, which means T-Mobile ONE . But because of the discounts on the phones, a customer could potentially get into the Galaxy S7 Edge in any color for $85 per month ($15/mo phone + $70/mo plan). That‚Äôs a pretty damn good deal. \nEDIT : T-Mobile ONE may not be a requirement at all. Depending on your plan, if you want one of these phones at the discount, you‚Äôll just need to try and see if you get the deal. In the comments, we‚Äôve already heard that Simple Choice plans seem to be eligible. \nAccording to the offer sheet, you owe zero up front for the phone. However, should you cancel wireless service at any time during, the remaining balance will (obviously) be owed. \nTo shop all of the phone discounts, hit up that link below. Cheers JJ! Post navigation Next Story Google I/O 2017 Registration is Now Open! wh1te_mag1c \nWow, I bought a refurbished S7 just a week ago. Bad timing on my part. Oh well, maybe it will serve me gloriously, anyway. Averix \nI assume a plan is required to buy them at this price. Can‚Äôt see them just selling the phones at this cost without being a T-Mobile customer. T4rd \nT-Mo chat seems to be useless at the moment.. I can‚Äôt get any responses so I‚Äôll ask here; do you have the option of turning a phone back in to T-Mo to pay off the EIP balance? Like you do on the Jump plan, but without upgrading to another phone. Just wondering if they‚Äôll let my family member do this so she can get out of the $446 balance still owed on her GS7 that she got at launch. Either this or maybe T-Mo is cool enough to credit the EIP balance some with this sale going on (doubt it). cobjones \nAnd you can flash the Galaxys to work on any network.. use Odin boom. T4rd \nHave you done this or seen it done? I was considering jumping to Verizon, but my mom has a line on my account with a GS7 and it would be a hassle to sell her phone towards a Verizon compatible phone. She got her GS7 at launch, not sure if that matters or not, I thought I read that they changed the carrier‚Äôs GS7 hardware at some point so they were all identical and this option became available then. Andy \nWorks for sure? Rico San \nTaxes and fees pushed it to $393 for me for an S7. Wondering if I want to jump ship from my OnePlus 3‚Ä¶ T4rd \nI would rather keep the OP3. I‚Äôve read a lot of GS7 owners complaining that the Nougat update brought a lot of newfound jank with it. One person said it was mostly in Chrome though so they started using the stock browser with much better performance. Chrome (beta) has seemed to got a lot more jankier on my 6P lately as well. But even so, I‚Äôd rather have the OP3. Rico San \nI bit and bought an S7. I figure, I have a 20 day return window if I don‚Äôt like it, and since I bought it outright I can always throw it on Swappa or Craigslist if I can‚Äôt return it/get stuck with a restocking fee. CHELSEA FC \ndo you know when will done with this promo? Zedlion \njust called tmo. they said this 15 dollars a month was for people looking to purchase the phone not lease with programs like jump on demand \nFYI üôÇ Francisco Pe√±a \ni called about billing issue and they said with jump i can get this deal too. Same thing when I got my G5, they gave me it for the same price. Joshua Jones \nThe LG Aristo and Galaxy On5 are also free with Simple choice no credit or a $100 prepaid account. Joshua Jones \nI can confirm. Any postpaid plan is eligible. dan0matic", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:46:58.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
