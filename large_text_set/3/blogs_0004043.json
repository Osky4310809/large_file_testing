But no amount of concrete could drown out the shrill whistle and rhythmic shouting that comprised IU's postgame rowdiness, as the Hoosiers celebrated an unexpected end to the regular season. \n“Everyone’s happy, because this is what we’re supposed to do,” junior guard James Blackmon Jr. said, “and getting wins in a tough conference is always good.” \nOn the final afternoon of its regular season, Indiana (17-14, 7-11) finally played the way the Hoosiers have insisted for the last three months that they could, like Blackmon said they were “supposed to.” \nAn 11-0 run to start and a record-setting performance buried the Buckeyes (17-14, 7-11) and sent IU into the Big Ten tournament with rare momentum. The Hoosiers’ points total, in a 96-92 win, was the most an opponent has ever scored in Value City Arena. \nRobert Johnson broke a weeks-long slump with a game-high 26 points, hitting 10-of-17 shots, while Blackmon had 22. \n“We saw that a little bit here a month ago with Michigan State. They came in here, hit their first six shots. But (Indiana) just kept going and going and going,” Ohio State coach Thad Matta said. “They were making shots at an alarming rate.” CLOSE x Share IU coach Tom Crean recaps the Hoosiers' 96-92 win at Ohio State, which set a record for most opponent points inside Value City Arena. Zach Osterman / IndyStar \nThe win ensures IU will either begin next week’s Big Ten tournament in Washington, D.C., as the No. 10 or No. 11 seed, pending the outcome of Sunday’s Michigan-Nebraska game. \nAnd it got ugly early for an Ohio State team that would have ensured itself a first-round bye in the nation’s capital with a win. \nIndiana scored the game’s first 11 points as 3-pointers finally fell. This was the Indiana of a year ago — driving aggressively, snapping off passes and finishing from all over the floor. \n“They were on fire,” Ohio State forward Jae’Sean Tate said. “It seemed like every shot they were taking was going in.” \n• BOX SCORE : Indiana 96, Ohio State 92 \nOhio State never really steadied itself in that first half, IU’s lead at one point climbed as high as 18. But for Evansville native JaQuan Lyle’s 15 points, the 54-40 halftime Indiana lead might have been much worse. \nAt halftime, Matta said he told his team to “make them feel us” defensively, predicting that the Buckeyes would have the lead down to just three points quickly. \nHe was almost right. Ohio State rallied to within four in just four minutes, and even took a brief lead, as IU scored just 10 points in the first 11 minutes of the second half. For a moment, Indiana wavered, an all-too-familiar sight for a team that’s blown its share of opportunities this winter.

Zach Osterman / IndyStar \nBut Blackmon drained a 3-pointer. Johnson hit a jumper. Juwan Morgan built a 5-0 run all by himself. Steadily — methodically — Indiana turned that one-point deficit back into a 10-point lead, in a span of less than five minutes. \n“I’ve got tremendous confidence in them,” IU coach Tom Crean said. “I think it’s great for them though, to see that they can put the stops together.” \nOhio State flirted with another comeback for the rest of the afternoon, even trimming IU’s lead to just two with four seconds left. \nThis time, Indiana held firm. It did so, in part, because it managed to turn two so-persistent weaknesses into strengths. \nThe Big Ten’s most turnover-prone team in league play, Indiana committed only 12 giveaways Saturday, in a high-possession game. Ohio State managed just 12 points off those turnovers. \nAnd while free-throw disparities have crippled the Hoosiers on the road this season — and Ohio State was one of the league’s best at earning free throws coming into play Saturday — IU finished Saturday even on attempts, and plus-two on points from the free-throw line. And that doesn’t even account for the multiple one-and-one front ends the Buckeyes missed, crippling their own comeback hopes. \n“We came out with the right mindset,” Johnson said. “That’s where it all started with us. Defensively, especially. We were really into guys and getting stops, and that translated really well offensively.” Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
