It represents an important landmark in Australia’s transformation from an inward looking, monocultural society to an outward looking, tolerant, confident, multicultural society.\n\nHe goes on and on, describing 18C as a “safety net” and “safeguard”.\nThis legislation is an important landmark in Australian politics and Australian social history because it says that Australia no longer regards those sorts of attitudes and forms of social intolerance and racism as acceptable. We are embracing in the 1990s all the best values of tolerance and multiculturalism. With this bill the government is providing an effective safety net that entrenches those values and attitudes in our society, offering a safeguard to people who may be the subject of racial violence and racial vilification.\n\nLatham was really quite eloquent tbh.\nThis landmark legislation builds on this achievement and entrenches those values into the statute books of the Commonwealth. It recognises that it is part of Australia’s laconic and easygoing character and an expression of our egalitarianism to have these forms of racial tolerance. Most Australians do not pass judgement or express intolerance on the basis of race, colour, creed and culture. Yet a small minority of racists and racist organisations do express and seek to incite racial intolerance and hatred. We need to be vigilant in these matters, understanding the racial intolerance, vilification and violence of a small minority in Australia, and also understanding that, in the broad sweep of Australian history, there have been some unfortunate characteristics of racism that at one time held the majority.\nHe said it was about balancing free speech and fair speech.\nA restriction against incitements to racial violence and vilification is totally valid to ensure not so much absolute freedom of speech but fair speech, consistent with the values of tolerance and understanding.\nIt reflected the decade’s “proper Australian values”.\nThere is no absolute freedom of speech in Australia because of those other restricting laws. This is a provision for fair speech, consistent with proper Australian values in the 1990s.\n\nFlash forward to 2017, when in the wake of being sacked from Sky News, Latham said race did not matter. Gender, race and sexuality do not matter - true Labor looks after people in socio-economic need - the poor, underclass.
