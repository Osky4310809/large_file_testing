Could   \nUkip's descent into civil war reached new levels of absurdity tonight, as claims emerged their only MP, Douglas Carswell had been in secret talks to rejoin the Tories. \nCarswell crossed the floor from the Conservatives to join Ukip in 2014. \nBut senior Tory sources reportedly said last night the Clacton MP had spoken to Tory MPs to \"sound out\" whether he would be welcomed back into the fold before the next election. \nThe claims came just hours after millionaire donor Arron Banks threatened to stand against the party's only MP in the next election. \nA blazing row has opened up over sole MP Douglas Carswell's failure to get former leader Nigel Farage a knighthood. \nFarage called for Carswell to be booted out of the party last night, in a furious column for the Daily Telegraph.
