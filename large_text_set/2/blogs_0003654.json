The next date for hearing on the matter is February 6. \nIn its complaint against Jio in CCI, Bharti has said the company through Mukesh Ambanis’s company has created a pan-India telecom network and distribution infrastructure even before its commercial launch and is now providing free voice and data services. tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:41:28.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
