Thus, he is one of five antagonists without a jumpscare. The four others are Phantom Mangle , Phantom Puppet , Circus Baby , and the Freddles of Nightmare Freddy . In the third and fourth games, however, Phantom BB and Nightmare Balloon Boy have jumpscares, unlike the original BB. BB and The Puppet are the only animatronics who do not have counterparts in the first game, making them completely original to Five Nights at Freddy's 2 . BB is the only animatronic who speaks in full words, with a non-distorted human voice. He is also the first animatronic in the series to have voice acting. Although, the name of BB's voice provider is unknown. When he is in the Left Air Vent, the balloon and sign he holds disappear. He appears to somehow retrieve them when he comes into The Office. BB is one out of the two animatronics introduced in the second game whose endoskeleton eyes never show, with the other being Toy Bonnie . However, there is a rare chance that upon death, Toy Bonnie's eyeless screen is seen, making BB the only new animatronic to bear their real eyes all the time. Furthermore, if one takes in account the similar eyeless screens of Freddy Fazbear and Foxy in the same game as well as the Night 3 cutscene, in which Bonnie and Chica appear to have no eyes, BB is the only one of all the antagonists to always have intact, human-like eyeballs. In fact, no part of BB's endoskeleton is ever seen. It is possible that BB's constant giggling and talking lures the newer animatronics into The Office since Phone Guy mentions that they are attracted by noises and move toward where the people are. BB is the only animatronic that doesn't appear anywhere in the Death Minigames . BB is one of four animatronics who do not appear in the hallway before entering The Office, with the others being Toy Bonnie, The Puppet, and Chica. BB, Freddy , Toy Freddy , and Foxy are the only animatronics to return to their starting locations during the night. BB's figurine (obtained by beating Night 7's Night of Misfits preset) shows him with a round, red nose that reaches his eyes, instead of his small, triangular nose. BB is one of only two animatronics to be featured as an unlockable figurine (as opposed to a plushie) that is awarded to the player after completing a specific Custom Night preset, the other being Toy Bonnie. When BB is in The Office, while Bonnie, Chica, Toy Freddy, or Freddy is in The Office at the same time, he cannot be seen. However, his laugh can be heard. Golden Freddy and BB can be seen in The Office together on rare occasions. Similar to the toy animatronics and The Puppet, BB was scrapped at the end of Night 6 due to possible malfunctioning. BB is the only animatronic not mentioned by Phone Guy . Some members of the community have compared Balloon Boy to the Villager from the Animal Crossing series, specifically his Super Smash Bros. incarnation. Both have a similar appearance (small, large round head with triangular nose, stubby arms with spherical hands) and both attack in a more indirect way, compared to the other characters, that includes the usage of balloons. The Villager also has a popular alternate interpretation as a psychotic killer underneath a more innocent exterior, to which Balloon Boy has some similar attributes. His laugh is sometimes audible when he isn't moving. BB and Toy Freddy are the only two animatronics who only appear in one camera feed in the trail from their starting position to The Office, being the Left Air Vent and Game Area, respectively. BB can leave the Game Area and the Left Air Vent without causing a static error. The same is also true for Foxy. BB is one of five animatronics to not be seen in a party room, the others being Toy Freddy, Foxy, The Puppet, and Golden Freddy. BB is one of shortest animatronics from the entire series. Others being Plushtrap , Nightmare Freddy 's Freddles, Bidybab , and Minireena . When Toy Bonnie enters The Office, BB appears to momentarily disappear and reappear after he leaves. Errors When BB is seen in cameras and the Left Air Vent blind spot, he has black buttons, however in The Office he has white buttons. This may be because of the lighting though it is most likely an error. BB's hand clips through his sleeve while he is in the Left Air Vent's blind spot. His hip also clips into the floor while he is in the Left Air Vent's blind spot.
