That was remarkable in its own right. We’re talking Kevlar padding that’s protecting his fractured ribs. \nSo Nelson was not only dealing with pain, potential breathing issues and some cumbersome gear … but he also performed early. He finished with six catches (on nine targets) for 67 yards and a touchdown, but it wasn’t enough as the Falcons thrashed the Packers , 44-21.

Really special moment here. @AaronRodgers12 gets choked up talking about @JordyRNelson playing with two broken ribs #Packers pic.twitter.com/vysALWXSdT \n— Stephen Watson (@WISN_Watson) January 23, 2017 \nOn the Packers’ first drive, Rodgers targeted Nelson on his first two throws of the game, connecting on completions of 27 and 15 yards. Nelson also took a shot from hard-hitting rookie safety Keanu Neal, who drilled Nelson out of bounds. That likely means that the pain didn’t get better — no matter what numbing agents the Packers medical staff — pumped into him before and during the game. \nHere’s to you, Jordy, on a tough day.
