The move prevents any electronics device larger than a smartphone from being taken on board the airplane as part of carry-on luggage.

US officials told the BBC that the ban has no end date.\nThe move will affect 10 airports and nine airlines across the countries of Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. NCB news says: “The restrictions will not apply to U.S.-based airlines but only to foreign carriers that operate flights from certain countries directly to U.S. airports, according to officials, and will not apply on purely domestic flights.”\nSee also: Nearly 100 tech companies, including Google and Apple, unite to fight Trump travel ban February 6, 2017 The airlines involved are Royal Jordanian, Egypt Air, Emirates, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, and Etihad Airways.
