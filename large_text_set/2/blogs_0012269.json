It more than doubled its ownership in American Airlines, upped by six times its shares in United and increased its investment in Delta by 1,465 percent. Berkshire also increased its ownership of Southwest Airlines, in which it now owns 43 million shares.

Can you think of an example of a retailer that was successfully turned around?” Advertisement - story continues below Ivanka Trump Posts Picture From Oval Office That’s Creating Buzz \nWalmart’s online sales for 2015 were $13.7 billion; Amazon amassed $107 billion in sales. \nTo compete against Amazon, Walmart needs to stress what it does best, said Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen. He said Walmart needs to use its physical presence to deliver services that can’t be replicated online and focus on its low-cost image. \n“Wal-Mart needs to change and accelerate innovation in pricing, assortment access, and experience; otherwise, we believe the company will continue to lose market share to Amazon,” Chen said. \nOther analysts say Amazon will be hard to beat. \n“The growing popularity and convenience of Amazon Prime , now in 50 million homes, makes it less and less likely shoppers would go anywhere else but Amazon,” said Stefany Zaroban, director of research for Internet Retailer. \n“Walmart doesn’t have the assortment, the fast shipping or the innovative culture that Amazon has,” said Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, an analyst with Forrester Research. “Walmart is certainly trying as best they can, but they have a lot of legacy systems and a big-company culture, which are difficult to change.” What do you think?
