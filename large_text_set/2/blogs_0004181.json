Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating) \nGK Joel Robles, 7 -- Enjoyed a quiet afternoon until his teammates fell asleep in the second half. Two vital saves from Harry Arter at 3-2 prevented a nervous Goodison descending into full-blown anarchy. \nDF Seamus Coleman, 7 -- Culpable for the second Bournemouth goal, though a third assist in four games points to a full-back rediscovering his attacking edge. \nDF Ashley Williams, 6 -- Imposing early on to the point he ended up through on goal in attack at one stage, but part of a shaky defence in the second half and rash in the build-up to the third Bournemouth goal. \nDF Ramiro Funes Mori, 6 -- The ungainly centre-back was all at sea for the goal that began the fleeting Bournemouth recovery. His spatial awareness and concentration simply has to improve to validate his place in the side. \nDF Leighton Baines, 7 -- A steadying influence on the left as the experienced left-back helped guide Ademola Lookman through his first league start. \nMF Gareth Barry, 7 -- Sat in front of the back four while others pressed on and grabbed the headlines. The veteran midfielder disrupted and distributed in the middle of the park and remains a more than useful option. \nMF James McCarthy, 9 -- An excellent 60-minute outing saw the Republic of Ireland international score and assist in the same Premier League game for the first time. A far more effective player when allowed to push on than when shielding the defence. \nMF Morgan Schneiderlin, 8 -- Mixed crunching but always controlled tackling with economical passing and continued his unruffled start to life on Merseyside. Always seems to have time in possession. \nMF Ross Barkley, 9 -- An impressively restrained and mature performance finished with a flourish as work ethic and a game-high five tackles won matched a delightful assist and well-taken goal. \nMF Ademola Lookman, 7 -- Totally unfazed and displayed admirable confidence as neat tricks and sharp footwork featured prominently in his first Premier League start. \nFW Romelu Lukaku, 10 -- Pace, power and finesse defined his fourth goal and his overall performance as the Belgian brushed past two visiting defenders with ease. Lukaku ran the visitors ragged en route to becoming the new top scorer in the division. Romelu Lukaku smashed four goals past Bournemouth on his way to becoming the Premier League's Golden Boot leader. Substitutes \nMF Tom Davies, 7 -- Used the ball well and helped restored some composure as the game wore on. \nMF Kevin Mirallas, N/R -- One or two careless moments in his own half aside, the winger slotted into midfield and played his part off the bench. \nDF Mason Holgate, N/R -- Generally assured as his introduction coincided with a chance in formation though lost his bearings in the build-up to the third Bournemouth goal. \nLuke is ESPN FC's Everton blogger.
