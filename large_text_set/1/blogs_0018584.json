We are proposing to change the name to The Shinfield Arms and would like to hear the views of anyone who lives in the area or anyone who has an opinion on this subject.” \nAfter hundreds of comments from customers urging the pub to keep its historical name, the pub said today it wouldn’t change it. \nThe company said: “What a fantastic response from everyone. Thanks so much for all your comments, your passion and enthusiasm - you’ve made the decision really easy.” \nOne social media user said: “It's not offensive. It's an historic name that refers back to the English civil war.” \nThe pub’s website says there are “many interesting theories” as to how the Inn acquired its “unusual” name. \nIt says: “As the pub was around during the reign of Charles II, it is supposed that it and other Black Boy pubs around the country were named after the king, who was renowned partly for his swarthy complexion. \n“Alternatively, many believe that the name comes from a famous dark figurine smoking a pipe that once adorned the doorway.\" Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T18:15:51.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
