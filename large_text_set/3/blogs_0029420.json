It has given me a new confidence. I feel sexy again instead of frumpy.” Read More British teacher fights the flab with her own unique New York 'triathlon' - completed in fancy dress Cindy's transformation is amazing (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \nHer weight had ballooned to 17st after giving Chris two children, and she admits she had let herself go and could no longer see the young bride he’d adored when she looked in the mirror. \nSo she decided to embark on a regime of sensible eating and exercise in a bid to get back her heath and happiness and build a new life for her children. \nCindy, who has now started dating again, said: “When I think about what Chris has done it still makes me angry. \n“But I can also see how I had changed from the person he met and for lots of ­reasons we had grown apart. \n\"I’m so much happier now because I look so much better. I’m getting my life back on track and it feels fantastic.” \nThe 30-year-old admitted: “I ballooned after I had kids. Chris had always hit the gym and was muscly so he had a huge appetite as he would burn so many calories. \n“But I would eat the same portions as him, giant plates packed with carbs, and desserts and alcohol too. Only I wasn’t working it off so it just turned into flab. \n“After we split up I started exercising at home to de-stress and began to eat healthily and drink lots of water. \n\"Suddenly I realised that there was more to life than food and I found my positivity again.” Cindy with her beloved children (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \nHowever, it has been a long and traumatic journey to get there. \nCindy ended up in hospital with a deadly blood clot last year, around the time she first became suspicious that keep-fit fan Chris was playing away. \nWhen she came home to convalesce she claims she found him cold and inattentive. They had a blazing row and it was then Chris admitted he was seeing someone else. \nCindy said: “I went crazy – the betrayal was the hardest part.” \nHe left home but Cindy had already turned detective and put a tracker app on his phone in a bid to find out who the other woman was. \nOver the following weeks the app showed he kept returning to the same street. \nAfter going to the road and knocking on house doors she finally tracked down the father of her kids – finding him in a pub with the new woman in his life. \nCindy said: “I couldn’t believe it. This woman looked so opposite to me, like the opposite of anyone Chris liked. She was covered in tattoos and looked like she went to the gym too. \n“He looked shocked when I walked in. I asked her if she knew he had a family but she didn’t answer. I was in bits.” \nCindy, of Salford, Greater Manchester, first met Chris in July 2005, when he cheekily tapped on the window of her mum’s car and said he wanted to take her out. \nShe was a 19-year-old college student and he was 30. Cindy recalled: “He was so cheeky and I liked bad boys. Cindy has more confidence than ever (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \n“We fell for each other right away. He was much older than me but only looked like he was in his early 20s. \n“I fell for his bad boy image and flirtatious character but in the end I suppose that was what caused the downfall of the relationship.” \nThe pair soon became inseparable and after six months Cindy moved in with Chris, who worked as a window fitter specialising in stained glass. \nIn 2009 they had daughter Lacey, followed by son Max in 2011. \nIn 2013, to Cindy’s delight, Chris proposed by hiding a ring in her popcorn when they went to the cinema and she began planning the wedding of her dreams. \nBut their relationship began to crumble when she became ill with the clot, which was related to a previous stomach injury. \n“It was a really difficult time in my life and my health was bad and my dad was ill too,” she recalled. \n“Everything felt like it was crumbling around me and I needed Chris then more than ever but it was already too late. He had lost ­interest.” Cindy Moore before her weight loss \nBut the combined shock of her spell in hospital followed by Chris’s infidelity led Cindy to overhaul her lifestyle. \nHuge portions, naughty treats and snacks between meals were swapped for lean meats, veg and salads. \nAnd rather than mope about, she took her stress out in the gym, sweating off the pounds. \nNow, she is even dipping her toe back in the dating pool and has high hopes of finding a happy ending to her story. \nCindy said of her time with her ex: “Chris was a really good dad, I couldn’t fault him. He did so much for the kids. \n“I was madly in love with him and I fear that I won’t find that again. \n“But I don’t hate him for leaving me then – I feel sorry for him for ­missing out on how ­fabulous I am now!.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T09:34:10.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
