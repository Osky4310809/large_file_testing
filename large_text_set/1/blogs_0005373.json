The entertainment industry, in particular, can often be distressing or discouraging for women, but it can, potentially, also be a source of strength. I’m a firm believer that sometimes our biggest touchstones of strength come from our most (seemingly) frivolous resources. \nSo, let’s take a moment to look back on the best that our celebrity culture had to offer this year. Here are some celebrities who used their platform to stand up for women. \nEmmy Rossum \nGood for Emmy Rossum for standing up for herself after seven seasons of fantastic work on Shameless and finally demanding to be paid the same as her co-star William H. Macy. As a Shameless mega-fan, I would have been pretty upset if Showtime hadn’t agreed, but thankfully for her, for us, and for all women, they did . \nKudos to Macy, as well, for taking her side in the matter. \nKesha \nKesha spent the early part of the year making headlines because she refused to stay in a business partnership with her accused abuser. She was victimized and villainized , but wouldn’t back down . \nPaul Feig \nPaul’s movies are great because (in addition to just being good, funny movies) he treats his female protagonists like, well, protagonists. He doesn’t write women like typical male characters in order to make them “strong” or “more accessible.” He doesn’t brand himself a “women’s writer.” He just writes great stories about awesome characters, who usually happen to be women. \nKerry Washington \nEarlier this year, Kerry Washington took on the issue of Photoshopping and managed to do so in a spectacularly diplomatic manner. Now, speaking out against racism and sexism doesn’t need to be polite by any means, but Washington’s ability to navigate her criticism of the treatment of her face in this way is impressive.

Take this October interview , for instance: \nWe have to take back everything that people said about us that was negative. Saying that your hair has got to be straightened in order to be formal. Your hair has got to be straightened in order to be beautiful. Being objectified for your beauty but not being appreciated for it in the same way caucasian women are. Taking back the light skin/dark skin thing. If you’re lighter than a paper bag, you’re cute. If you’re darker, you’re less attractive.

This came after making the world realize how awful they’d been to Marcia Clarke, announcing a show about the greatest old-Hollywood feud between two powerful actresses, and starting a program called Half, dedicated to increasing opportunities for women and POC in Hollywood. \nChrissy Teigen \nChrissy Teigen is a must-follow on social media if you enjoy your feminism with a side of with brash, unapologetic, foul-mouthed opinions. (My favorite kind.) Spending most of the year pregnant, Teigen’s fans got to see her take down a whole new kind of shamer, which was a rage-filled delight. I went to dinner. People are pissed. Good morning! pic.twitter.com/oQ54mtet8c \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) April 24, 2016 \nGabrielle Union \nGabrielle Union spent the promotional tour for Birth of a Nation basically doing Nate Parker’s job for him . Meaning, she was willing to have the conversation about sexual assault that he wasn’t. She—a survivor herself—even managed to make the conversation about the movie (in which she plays a survivor) without it ever coming off as exploiting the subject. That’s an impressive feat. \nMaisie Williams \nMaisie Williams had one of the best feminist interview pullquotes of the year, and for that, she deserves heaps of praise. Remember this gem from back in April? \nI got asked in one of my first interviews: “Is Arya a feminist?” I didn’t even know what a feminist was […] And then someone explained it to me. And I remember thinking, “Isn’t that just like everyone?” And then I realized everyone is not a feminist, unfortunately. But I also feel like we should stop calling feminists “feminists” and just start calling people who aren’t feminist “sexist” – and then everyone else is just a human. You are either a normal person or a sexist. People get a label when they’re bad. Because it works the other way, as well. \nOh, and let’s not forget that time in June when she “fixed” a horribly sexist headline that focused on her sheer top instead of her great actions.

The same can be said about her encounters with a racist supermarket employee . As was the case last year with the racist criticism of her hairstyle . In short, Zendaya is the best.

If you’re not watching Full Frontal yet, you’ve missed out on most of the year’s best political commentary. \nBeyoncé \nI don’t even know how to talk about Beyoncé’s Lemonade. How do you talk about one of the best albums/short films of the year, that also happened to be a giant step towards dismantling the entertainment industry’s (if not the world’s) white patriarchy? HOW? \nCarrie Fisher \nMany of the interviews and quotes and roles and writing and other work illustrating Carrie Fisher’s dedication to feminism didn’t happen this year. But in the last week, we’ve all been flooded with them, both online and in our memories. After decades of standing up for herself, for women, for mental illness, and for addiction, let’s take a moment to remember that time , just over a year ago, when she flat-out refused to humor an interviewer’s “stupid” questions about her weight. \nObviously, these weren’t all the great moments in Hollywood feminism this year. What did we leave out? \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T18:07:32.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
