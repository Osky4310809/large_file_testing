However, the Alpha variant you saw in our first-look review of the Ignis will be the top-of-the-line variant with all the bells and whistles. Maruti Suzuki has equipped the Ignis with first-in-segment features like LED headlamps, infotainment system with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and MirrorLink and some more. Since the top Alpha trim of the Ignis is expected to cost somewhere around Rs 7 lakh, the lower variants might deliver more value as features like ABS and airbags are standard throughout the range. So, let’s take a closer look at the less equipped but all-the-more-important variants of the Ignis – the Delta and the Zeta. \nMaruti Suzuki Ignis Zeta \nThe Zeta variant will be the penultimate trim on offer and will be available with both diesel and petrol engines. The Ignis Zeta will give the buyers all the necessary and some feel-good features like push-button start, electrically folding ORVMs and alloy wheels that the lower Delta and Sigma variants don’t possess. Maruti Suzuki will offer the same black alloy wheels that feature on the top-of-the-line Alpha trim which you have already seen in detail. The music system remains as is in the Alpha trim, however, it won’t be a touchscreen affair and therefore will not feature any of the mobile pairing software. Here’s a look at how the Zeta variant will look in the flesh. \nMaruti Suzuki Ignis Delta \nThe Delta trim will be the least-loaded variant of the diesel Ignis. For the petrol version, it’ll be the second most equipped variant over the Sigma trim. Both the Delta and Zeta variants will feature AMT transmission (a manual transmission will also be on offer) and therefore, these variants will get all the necessary features that the millennials will look for in their daily drive. \nSo, the Delta trim gets creature comfort features like electrically adjustable ORVMs, music system (which looks the same as on the Zeta) with steering mounted controls and rear power windows. Cosmetically, this variant will lack the stylish black alloy wheels and will have to settle for wheel caps over steel wheels. The chrome finishing in the front around the grille will also be missing. Fog lamps will be another feature that won’t make it to the Delta trim. Let’s see how this variant looks without some missing cosmetic ingredients. \nOverall, the Ignis looks decently loaded even in the Delta trim which gets all those features that this generation would want to have as standard. While prices are still a mystery, if the Delta petrol trim falls within or around the Rs 5 lakh mark, the Ignis will be one car to watch out for on the sales charts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T16:53:20.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
