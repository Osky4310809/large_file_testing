I never said 'LGBT'... I said 'SIN'.\"\nShe added, according to the BBC :\n\"To every person who is dealing with the homosexual spirit, that has it, I love you and God loves you but God hates the sin in you and me. Anything that is against the nature of God. I make no excuses or apologies. My love is as pure as it comes.\"\nAn archived version of her Facebook Live can be viewed here .\nAccording to Jezebel , Burrell was scheduled to sing a song from the Hidden Figures soundtrack with Pharrell Williams on DeGeneres' show. Williams will now reportedly perform solo.\nWilliams addressed the issue in a post on Instagram, saying \"I condemn hate speech of any kind.\"\nA photo posted by Pharrell Williams (@pharrell) on Dec 31, 2016 at 10:49am PST\nJanelle Monae, who is also scheduled to be on the episode and has a role in Hidden Figures , shared Williams' post with her own extended comment, saying, \"I will rejoice when folks stop thinking they ARE GOD, Jesus' assistant, picking and choosing what 'sins' are acceptable in the Bible, and using the Bible as a whip! WE can't afford anymore tearing down of our shared humanity.\"\nI shouldn't even have to post this as you guys should already know where I stand but If you do not pls know I unequivocally repudiate ANY AND ALL hateful comments against the LGBTQ community. In addition, I feel we all belong to the same community, a shared community called humanity. And today and tomorrow and the next day I will continue to stand with other like minded people who condemn any and all statements and actions that would seek to deny the basic humanity of our fellow brothers and sisters. We cannot sit Idly by nor will we speak silently when we are confronted with such violence against members of our community. I am personally beyond exhausted by the ignorance and bigotry living in some people. At times I want to punch and I want to slap a lot of people when I read and hear the shit that comes out their mouthes !!! I will rejoice when folks stop thinking they ARE GOD, Jesus' assistant, picking and choosing what \"sins\" are acceptable in the Bible, and using the Bible as a whip! WE can't afford anymore tearing down of our shared humanity. My advice: If your religion is causing you to spew out words of hate, judge, or look down on others because of who one loves then you need to change it. And fast. If the religion don't make you are more loving or better person, ditch it. But what do I know. My hope is that we ALL go into this new year considering for one moment that we don't have all the answers. My hope is that we become more understanding, less judgmental, more tolerate, and more patient with one another. Including me.
