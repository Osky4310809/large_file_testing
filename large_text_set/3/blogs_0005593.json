In the end Aguero will just give up because whatever he does will never be enough. \nI felt like that under Gregory. I remember scoring two goals in a game and he moaned I had not got three. He always focused on what I wasn’t doing rather than what I was doing and, long term, that’s never going to work.

But you have to know how to deal with every personality if you want to be a serial winner. \nI’ve no doubt that Guardiola will win the Premier League in the next couple of years, but only because City will buy the players to help him do that. But great manager? I’d go as far as to say his man-management skills are rotten. Guardiola fell out with Ibrahimovic at Barcelona (Photo: Getty Images) Could Aguero be going the same way as Ibrahimovic? (Photo: Getty) \nThe sneering you see from him in press conferences gives you an ­insight into what he’ll be like in the dressing room and I don’t know how easy he’d be to play for. \nRemind me who Guardiola fell out with at Barcelona… \nThat’s right: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \nHe has previous and it doesn’t bode well for Aguero. poll loading Will Guardiola make Man City champions? 3000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T15:09:33.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
