Here's how they fit in their new programs and when they could see playing time. Chris Johnson, SI.com , Special to Scout Alabama ’s run to the national championship game with Jalen Hurts at quarterback this season is the most prominent recent example of a program thriving with a first-year signal caller under center. When Hurts arrived in Tuscaloosa out of Channelview (Texas) High as a mid-year enrollee last year, he entered a heated position battle featuring both more experienced ( Cooper Bateman ) and more highly touted ( Blake Barnett ) options. But by the end of the first quarter of the Crimson Tide’s season-opening 52–6 blowout of USC , Hurts had seized control of the starting job. A few months later, after being named the SEC’s offensive player of the year, he came one two-yard Hunter Renfrow touchdown reception away from becoming the first true freshman QB to lead a team to a national title since Oklahoma ’s Jamelle Holieway in 1985.\nIt would be a surprise if any quarterback in the class of 2017 makes a similar impact in his first season on campus. Yet several from that group should at least compete for playing time right away. While more than two weeks remain before National Signing Day, the most highly regarded quarterbacks in the class have already decided where they’re going to play in college: The top 46 passers in Scout.com’s rankings have already announced their choices. Two- and three-star QBs often defy rankings by excelling as starters, just as four- and five-stars can flop after being built up as program saviors, but for now SI.com is focusing on the top 10 signal callers set to join programs next season, according to Scout.com.
