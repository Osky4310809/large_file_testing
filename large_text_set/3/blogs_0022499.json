News Arsene Wenger is Arsenal says Lukas Podolski as under-pressure manager ponders future \nThe 31-year-old forward, who marked his 130th and final Germany appearance with a stunning winner against England on Wednesday, played under Wenger during a three-year spell Thursday 23 March 2017 09:40 GMT Click to followThe Independent Online Lukas Podolski worked with Arsene Wenger for three years at Arsenal Getty \nLukas Podolski insists his former club would find it hard to replace Arsene Wenger because \"he is Arsenal \". \nThe 31-year-old forward, who marked his 130th and final Germany appearance with a stunning winner against England on Wednesday, played under Wenger during a three-year spell at Arsenal before joining current club Galatasaray in 2015. \nAnd Podolski believes Wenger, whose future in north London is uncertain, is going to be a hard act to follow at the Emirates. Germany 1 England 0 player ratings Germany 1 England 0 player ratings 1/22 Marc-Andre ter Stegen – 6 out of 10 \nRash when coming out to challenge Vardy early on, but stood firm to block Alli’s decent chance towards the end of the first half. 2/22 Joshua Kimmich – 7 out of 10 \nOne of the few young German players to have a decent evening and potentially sent a message to Carlo Ancelotti, who has not offered him much playing time this season. 3/22 Mats Hummels – 7 out of 10 \nGermany’s best all-round performer, rarely looked troubled by England’s attacking talents. 4/22 Antonio Rudiger – 6 out of 10 \nA solid display, if unspectacular. Did well on the rare occasions when England went aerial. 5/22 Jonas Hector – 7 out of 10 \nImpressed after taking his time to grow into the game. His link-up play with Sane in the second-half was at the root of all England’s problems. 6/22 Julian Weigl – 5 out of 10 \nThe main culprit in Germany’s surprising struggle to who Hauled off for Liverpool’s Emre Can midway through the second half. 7/22 Toni Kroos – 5 out of 10 \nSurprisingly poor when it came to the simple stuff, misplaced several passes when not under pressure. Struggled to win his battle against the lesser light of Livermore. 8/22 Leroy Sane – 6 out of 10 \nDid not crackle like we know he can from his recent Manchester City form, but another who improved as the evening went on. Perhaps should’ve doubled Germany’s lead. 9/22 Julian Brandt – 4 out of 10 \nAnother player reportedly attracting Premier League interest, he did not show why here. Switched for Andre Schurrle. 10/22 Lukas Podolski – 6 out of 10 \nThe equivalent of a testimonial for the veteran and you could tell from his first-half performance. Then came Der Hammer, as Germany’s support calls his left peg. A stunning winner. 11/22 Timo Werner – 4 out of 10 \nThe RB Leipzig frontman, a reported target for Liverpool, failed to translate his exciting form at club level to the international stage. Disappointing, but it was only his debut. 12/22 Joe Hart – 7 out of 10 \nCould do little for Podolski’s goal, but did well shortly after to deny Sane with an excellent stop down low to his left. 13/22 Gary Cahill – 4 out of 10 \nLucky not to concede a penalty for needlessly leaning into a cross in the first-half and could have done better to stop Podolski’s screamer. 14/22 Michael Keane – 6 out of 10 \nAsked to play in a back three on his debut after excelling in a rigid four at Turf Moor all season, but coped admirably. One lapse in concentration was almost punished by Sane. 15/22 Chris Smalling – 5 out of 10 \nAn indifferent night from the centre-half. Unlike Cahill, he was rarely called into question, but still did not convince. 16/22 Kyle Walker – 6 out of 10 \nShowed why he will be integral to Southgate’s England in his forays down the right flank, but only did so in glimpses. Hector and Sane began to cause him problems has the game went on. 17/22 Eric Dier – 6 out of 10 \nA lucky boy not to be severely punished for a late, robust tackle on Weigl. That aside, he helped to stifle Germany’s midfield. 18/22 Jake Livermore – 7 out of 10 \nNot everyone’s idea of a no 7, but combined well with Dier in the centre of the park to disrupt Germany’s passing, particularly in the first half. 19/22 Ryan Bertrand – 6 out of 10 \nNot as threatening as Walker was in moments, but defensively solid and frustrated Brandt in the first-half. Schurrle gave him a few more problems after the break. 20/22 Dele Alli – 7 out of 10 \nEngland’s main creative outlet, but also found himself on the end of several chances. Should have opened the scoring with the first-half’s best chance but hit it straight at Ter Stegen. 21/22 Adam Lallana – 7 out of 10 \nCame close to scoring in his fourth straight England appearance, but thwacked the post after an impressive burst forward. 22/22 Jamie Vardy – 5 out of 10 \nAggrieved to have not won a penalty early on, but you could tell he was looking for it. Too deep at times too, despite Germany’s defensive line offering him space in behind. \nHe told Sky Sports: \"I follow nearly every match - when not live, on social media - and I don't know what's happened. Arsenal's 'Invincibles' unanimous in Wenger stance \n\"Arsene Wenger is a good guy and a good coach. He built this club from nothing to now, and it will be interesting what happens in the next months.\" \nWhen asked whether he thinks Wenger should stay, Podolski added: \"I don't know who the guy is that can replace him. He is Arsenal.\" \nPA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T11:42:38.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
