Why are all citizens equal, but some are more equal than others? \nIt was only a few months ago that we broke bread together. He talked about how much he valued the Muslim community. I was so proud of what I hoped were changes in the attitude of the the Australian government – it was the first ever Iftar (which is the breaking fast meal during Ramadan) held at Kirribilli House – that I wrote an article supporting the event following criticism it received in the press. \nI had thought there was real potential we could be welcoming a prime minister that valued us as equal citizens in this country, despite all the global hatred and rhetoric. I looked forward to this country being led by someone who cared. Perhaps, I naively thought, we would see a changed approach to the threats of terrorism in this country, a change of approach to processing refugees and asylum seekers and maybe (with my fingers really crossed), we Muslims might soon start to feel truly equal in this country. 'Big personality': Australian PM puts brave face on phone call with Trump Read more \nBut it wasn’t to be, was it? \nI have sought to have empathy for Turnbull’s position. The man, caught between numerous boulders and many a hard place, doesn’t seem like he has much room to turn. He seems stuck trying to please everyone, and in doing so pleasing none and allowing the marginalised in this country to bear the brunt of his dithering. \nAnd for what? To allow the allies we so dearly dedicate ourselves to an opportunity to shut us down and humiliate us ? It’s embarrassing. The Australian government seems to think our history and tacit support of the xenophobic policies of the United States is the best option for our national interests – but I beg to differ. These are policies and positions that have been proven time and time again to make countries less safe and to play right into the hands of those we are all trying to fight . What will it take for one of our leaders to show values-based leadership, and to live the principles we claim to build our country on? \n“Our commitment to multiculturalism and a non-discriminatory immigration system is well known,” Turnbull said a few days ago. Malcolm Turnbull (@TurnbullMalcolm) January 30, 2017 \nIf multiculturalism means we can all get great Vietnamese, Turkish and Brazilian food all within a few blocks of each other, sure. If it means we will all know to say “Happy Lunar Year!” to a colleague, I’ll agree with the prime minister. If it means that someone like me, a Sudanese-born Muslim woman, can be sent to countries overseas as part of a Dfat-funded public diplomacy program to show people that “not all Australians are white” (or racist, as I am constantly asked) then I can see where that statement comes from. \nBut that’s not really what being committed looks like. \nBeing committed looks like not “supporting” a ban that discriminates based on birth country and faith, because we value inclusivity, and we want to heed the lessons of history. For over a decade, Muslims in Australia have been made to feel like our citizenship and Australian-ness is conditional. \nBeing committed looks like not continuing to support terrorism laws that are not-so-subtly aimed at young Muslims, and are shown to further marginalise young people . Being committed looks, sounds and feels like not violating the refugee convention by indefinitely locking up those seeking asylum. I thought we had boundless plains to share? (Boundless plains, mind you, that aren’t even ours.) \nThe irony is that last year the federal government funded me to travel to Sudan – one of the countries on Trump’s banned list – with the Australian Embassy in Cairo , which is also accredited to Sudan. We reached out to universities, non-for-profit organisations and entrepreneurs. I waxed lyrical about the benefits of Australia, the opportunities afforded and what we could all learn from the Australian example. \nI was incredibly grateful for the opportunity to bring my countries of birth and breeding together. It was the first ever public diplomacy program that the Australian government ran in Sudan. It was a huge achievement and one that has begun an ongoing relationship. But how much is that relationship valued? Australia needs to adapt to the new circumstances of Trump’s America | James Curran Read more \nWhy should Australian-Sudanese dual citizens, or any Australians from marginalised cultural or racial backgrounds, continue to support this government’s federal policy when it is so clearly further marginalises us? An attitude that feeds into an us-and-them rhetoric, that dehumanises and ostracises us, that makes us feel like we’re not equal? \nThe reality is that for over a decade, Muslims in Australia – myself included – have been made to feel like our citizenship and “Australian-ness” is conditional . That we have to constantly prove how dedicated we are to this country that doesn’t value us. That we should be “so grateful” for all the opportunities, to the point of grovelling. Yet no amount of apologising for the actions of others seems to make any difference. \nIt’s time that the prime minister and his government put their money where their mouth is. Follow the examples of international counterparts who have actively condemned the policies of governments that are clearly discriminatory – allies or otherwise (and perhaps, fix our discriminatory policies as well) – because Turnbull has done so before . Respect Muslim communities enough to not treat us like an “other” and dehumanise us, day in, day out. Show us the commitment to multiculturalism so often talked about, a line used as a shield against any criticism or accusation of bias. \nShow me that all humans are equal, none more than others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:59:36.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
