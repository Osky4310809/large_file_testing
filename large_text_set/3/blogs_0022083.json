As a result of the positive drug test, Andrade now faces a two year sanction. \nAndrade’s suspension was made retroactive to March 20, 2016, which was the day after his most recent fight against Richard Walsh in Australia. Per the UFC’s anti-doping policy, because Andrade’s drug test was taken ahead of his fight the promotion holds the right to disqualify him and nullify the results of the bout. \nAndrade was victorious against Walsh but the UFC could strip him of the win and declare the fight a no contest, but that decision hasn’t been made as of yet. \nBased on the date of his suspension, Andrade would be eligible to return to action after March 20, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:27:15.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
