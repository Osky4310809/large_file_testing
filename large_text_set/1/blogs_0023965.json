Mark Dayton highlighted Tuesday as he detailed his proposed $46 billion, two-year state spending plan. Dayton’s spending blueprint is meant to guide the GOP-majority Legislature as it prepares to prepare and pass the next two-year budget later this year. Republicans are likely to push back on the DFL governor’s most notable initiatives, which include: a $75 million investment to allow more students to attend prekindergarten programs, an increased gas tax to fund improvements to roads and bridges, and an expansion of the state’s MinnesotaCare health insurance program to provide a public option for more people. Dayton said he knows it will be an uphill battle to win the support of the House and Senate, but urged lawmakers to set aside their differences to take quick action on health care premiums and other issues. “This is a year it really is imperative that the Legislature act,” he said of his transportation plan. “If they don’t want to adopt my proposal, then they need to come up with one of their own and it has to be real funding,” he said. Republican lawmakers quickly responded with criticism for Dayton’s ideas on paying for health care and transportation. Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-Nisswa, said his colleagues “agree with many of the governor’s priorities, but disagree with his ideas for implementing them.” “The old mind-set is that higher taxes, unsustainable spending increases, and more people on government-run health care will solve everything. Republicans want to try a new approach: patient-centered healthcare, common sense budgeting, and lower taxes,” Gazelka said. The governor’s proposal includes tax cuts he said would affect 450,000 Minnesotans. His spending plans are funded with the help of an estimated $1.4 billion budget surplus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:23:28.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
