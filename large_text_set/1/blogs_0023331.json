Next year, Freeform is set to debut its own Marvel series when the network adapts Cloak & Dagger into a sure-hit drama. While the show has been delayed already, it looks like progress is being made on the series. According to the folk at Season Zero, it looks like Marvel’s Cloak & Dagger has nabbed itself a pilot director. UP NEXT: Marvel's Cloak & Dagger Delayed, Showrunner Confirmed \nThe Marvel and ABC venture is allegedly set to kick off under the guidance of Gina Prince-Bythewood. The director, who is known for her work on The Secret Life of Bees and Beyond the Lights , is reportedly attached to the project. \nNot long ago, fans learned that Cloak & Dagger had been saddled with a showrunner and working title. Joe Pokaski of Daredevil and Heroes will oversee the entire series, and Production Weekly outed the project’s working title as “Shadows.” \nSo far, it looks like things on the backend of the superhero show are coming together nicely. With its development on track, fans have also learned what kind of budget the anticipated show will be granted. According to NOLA , Walt Disney Company filed paperwork with Louisiana to film the show’s first season there, and it noted that Cloak & Dagger ’s budget was more than $42 million. Clearly, you can take down a bunch of villains with that kind of cash. \nThe synopsis for Marvel’s Cloak & Dagger can be read below: \n“This exciting new series is an adaptation of the beloved Marvel characters aimed squarely at young adults. This live-action interracial romance follows Tandy Bowen and Tyrone Johnson, two teenagers from very different backgrounds, who find themselves burdened and awakened to newly acquired superpowers while falling in love. Tandy can emit light daggers and Tyrone has the ability to engulf others in darkness. They quickly learn they are better together than apart—but their feelings for each other make their already complicated world even more challenging.” (Photo: Marvel Comics)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T10:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:13:43.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
