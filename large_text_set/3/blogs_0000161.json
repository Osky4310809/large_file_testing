PUBLISHED: 18:00,   18:37, Tue, Feb 28, 2017 \nSir Julian King, who was appointed Britain’s European Commissioner last summer, this afternoon told MPs there was “no reason” why the exchange of core intelligence information should alter once the UK quits the EU. \nThe former ambassador, who has taken on the European Commission’s security brief, also dismissed ex-prime minister Sir John Major’s suggestion there is a “sour” atmosphere ahead of Brexit talks. \nSir Julian described Britain as a “known and valued partner” and outlined a “shared interest” between the UK and EU member states in continuing intelligence and security co-operation. \nHe described terrorism and cyber crime as the biggest current threats to the EU.

I haven't experienced a sour atmosphere. Sir Julian King \nDespite agreeing both the EU and UK want to continue co-operating on security issues post-Brexit, Sir Julian suggested that may not be the case. \nHe said: “On this and on various other things… in the end fundamentally because of the shared interest where there's a will there's very often a way. \n“But if everyone agrees you should do something doesn't mean it is necessarily straightforward and easy to do.” \nAsked by Tory MP Ranil Jayawardena whether it was right to assume there would be a “grown-up” agreement between the remaining 27 EU member states and the UK on security matters due to the common threats faced by both, Sir Julian highlighted “legal constraints and practical constraints”. \nHe also adopted the European Commission’s hardline view that a practical divorce agreement would have to be negotiated first before the EU and UK could discuss their post-Brexit relationship.
