However, my mom didn’t want to spend money on overpriced drinks at the club we were going to, so she tried to bring her glass bottle of Bud Light into the venue. \nI won’t go into the hairy details, but let’s just say they (obviously) did not let her in with the beer, and I ended up partying without her for the rest of the night. \nHayleigh Quinn , 19, on the other hand, has the most genius mom ever when it comes to drinking in public. Twitter Quinn, who’s from Glasgow, and her mother were boarding a train for a family night out, when her mom whipped out what appeared to be an umbrella to protect against the wrath of Storm Doris. Twitter However, a closer look revealed THERE IS ALCOHOL INSIDE THE UMBRELLA, AND THE UMBRELLA IS ACTUALLY A FLASK. Twitter \nGenius. \nQuinn tweeted out the pictures of her mom displaying this total game-changer, saying: \nFKN HOWLING oot wi ma maw n she’s brought her umbrella which is actually a hip flask in disguise \nHer tweet has since received over 1,200 retweets and 7,500 likes. \nTwitter users were quick to ask where Quinn’s mom acquired such a lovely contraption, and the answer appears to be Amazon . \nUgh, bless that website. Most people can agree this invention is truly life-changing. Twitter It would definitely make the happiest place on earth even happier. Twitter I guess in case there’s no open bar already? Twitter \nYou better believe I have already ordered one for myself and one for my mom. Never again will a rainy day be sad thanks to this bad boy.
