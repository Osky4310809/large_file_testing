The two have locked horns over the latter releasing an unseen short film of her late friend on her death anniversary, April 1. \nAccording to a report in DNA, Rahul claims that Kamya has tampered with old videos of Pratyusha to put together the film revolving around heartbreak and depression – the reasons that drove her to suicide. He has also objected to a character intentionally named after him being shown as abusive. \nHe reportedly wrote in his complaint: \nWhy was her death anniversary chosen to release the film? It is just for publicity. Pratyusha never made any short film during our relationship. The suicide matter is sub judice, so I request you to lodge an FIR against Kamya Punjabi under sections of IPC and cyber law. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T09:53:42.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
