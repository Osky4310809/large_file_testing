According to The Hollywood Reporter , Gaga brought considerable attention to the initiative with her poignant performance of \"Til It Happens To You, \" a song about the aftermath of sexual assault, at the 2016 Academy Awards, which featured survivors joining her on stage. Incredible performance from my friend @LadyGaga . You amaze me — and not just onstage. Proud to work with you to end sexual assault. #ItsOnUs pic.twitter.com/ZOva2lpAOZ — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) February 6, 2017 \nBiden's tweet serves as a sharp reminder that there is still plenty of work to be done, work that his just-launched charitable foundation pledges to undertake. \n\"We look forward to this new chapter where we will continue our work to ensure that everyone — no matter their income level, race, gender, age, or sexuality — is treated with dignity and gets a fair shot at achieving the American Dream,\" he and his wife Jill Biden said in a statement. \nCombatting sexual assault and violence against women has in many ways defined Biden's lengthy career as a civil servant, as Biden acknowledged in a 2016 interview with Mic. \n\"This has been the passion of my career . I've done a lot of other things in my career, but, you know, when I first started speaking on this no one wanted to talk about it. Nobody wanted to talk about it. It's the single most important thing that I can do domestically, and I'm going to continue as long as I have a breath in me... I'll be involved in this until I take my last breath, because there's too many beautiful, bright, decent, honorable young men and women who are being victimized.\" \nThe video capturing the launch of the It's On Us campaign is well worth watching for the courage of those who've stepped forward to tell their stories... and to see why, exactly, this initiative is so important.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:36:46.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
