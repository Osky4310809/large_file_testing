(Gallo Images) Related Links Rebels unchanged for Waratahs \nGareth Duncan - MyPlayers.co.za \nJohannesburg - Lions wing Courtnall Skosan was quick to credit his team-mates after scoring four tries during the bonus-point win over the Reds in Johannesburg. \nSkosan joined the record books last Saturday, becoming the 14th player and the third South African to score four tries in one Super Rugby match. It happened during a dominant Lions performance against the Reds, which saw the home team beat their Australian opponents 44-14 after scoring seven tries. \nHowever, Skosan refused to take much credit for his impressive performance on the wing. \n“It was amazing scoring four tries, but it all came from an amazing team effort. The guys really made me look good on the scoresheet!” Skosan told MyPlayers . “I was at the right place at the right time as the guys set me up with great attacking play. We worked really hard last week during training to ensure we had all the right systems in place. The win was the reward to all the efforts made by the players and coaches.” \nOn the other wing, Madosh Tambwe also delivered a good performances as he made his Super Rugby debut at the age of 19. \nSkosan was proud of the youngster’s step-up. \n“Madosh is an exciting talent. He showed great composure and skill during his first Super Rugby match,” said Skosan. “For a young guy, he showed so much promise and I know everybody is looking forward to his promising future at the Lions.” \nLooking ahead, the Lions will be working hard to ensure they qualify for the play-offs and give themselves a better opportunity to win the Super Rugby title after losing the final last year. Skosan hopes to make a valuable contribution to the team’s cause. \n“Personally, I’m not looking too far ahead. I want to play good rugby week in and week out and help the Lions achieve success in every game. I’m putting in the hard work at training, but there’s always room to improve. I believe if I play consistently well, the rewards will come.” \nFor more exclusive player content, check out MyPlayers.co.za", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:19:55.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
