Samsung previously offered LTE with the sportier Gear S3 frontier. The company today announced that it’s adding 4G LTE support to the Gear S3 classic. \nSamsung has confirmed that the LTE version of the Gear S3 classic will be available from Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. It will allow users to call, navigate, pay and more using just the smartwatch on their wrist as it won’t depend on a smartphone for an internet connection. It gets support for Samsung Pay as well so users can make payments on the go with their LTE-compatible Gear S3 classic. \nThis gives customers the freedom to choose between the style that they want, whether they like the more traditional looking Gear S3 classic or the sporty Gear S3 frontier , they can now have LTE on both. Everything else remains the same so it’s pretty much the same smartwatch that the company launched last year. \nPricing and availability details will be confirmed by Samsung’s carrier partners. No word as yet if this variant will be released in other markets across the globe as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:11:33.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
