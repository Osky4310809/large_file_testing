Although we won’t get the First Edition in America, this model marks the first time we’ve seen the Stelvio in its standard form, as Alfa only revealed the high-performance Quadrifoglio model upon its debut last fall. \nShorn of the QV model’s body kit, aggressive wheels and tires, and quad exhaust tips, the standard Stelvio presents a cleaner, uncluttered profile that’s attractive to our eye—dare we say that its overall proportions may be even better-looking than those of the Giulia sedan ? The First Edition model wears 20-inch wheels, colored brake calipers, and some extra chrome, while its interior equipment includes paddle shifters, heated front seats, wood trim, and an 8.8-inch central display screen with navigation. Like the Giulia sedan on which it’s based, the Stelvio’s base engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder; in the U.S., this engine’s 280 horsepower and 306 lb-ft of torque will be routed through all four wheels as standard, with the only transmission choice being an eight-speed automatic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:00:15.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
