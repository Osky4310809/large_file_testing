Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA Celebrity Big Brother housemate asked for a pregnancy test in a shock revelation which producers hid from viewers. \nUS reality stars Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt asked for the test after revealing they were trying for a baby. \nAccording to the Daily Star it is thought the pair wanted to announce their baby news to go further in the show. The pair have joked about how if they become parents it would be better for their careers as they could land their own reality show. \nStrictly star Kristina Rihanoff announced her baby news on the show last year. (Photo: Channel 5) (Photo: Channel 5) \nA source told the Daily Star: \"Spiedi were really hoping to get a positive result. They knew it would make them the centre of attention and be great TV. And of course there would be massive earning potential because fans would want to follow their journey to becoming parents.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Heidi eats 'salty snacks' as she worries about being boring this CBB   \nUnfortunately the test was negative. \nIt comes as Speidi was the second eviction of Friday night, having lost out to Kim Woodburn in the voting stakes. \nOpening up to Emma Willis after they exited the house, Spencer explained why they started a lot less drama this time around, claiming it was because they got on with most of their housemates. \n\"We love most of the house this time round. We had run-ins but loved Nic [ Nicola McLean ],\" Heidi said. Spencer and Heidi get booted out (Photo: Channel 5) \nAnd Spencer added: \"We wanted to win until we met James Cosmo – it's like having a unicorn in the house. We tried to play along, play the game, but James C to win.\" \nSpeaking about their old nemesis, Spencer then revealed he'd have loved a certain CBB Bit On The Side presenter to join them in the house. \n\"I wished Rylan had come in, put some heat on them all,\" he joked. Heidi hugs Emma as they make their grand exit (Photo: Channel 5) \nEmma asked them about their interactions with Kim after their explosive arguments - and Speidi both claimed it was all part of Kim's game plan to get loads of attention. \n\"I think Kim's an incredible game-player, as much as I want to be like, 'you're a vile, filthy ratbag', I can't because she loves Big Brother ,\" said Spencer of his foe. \n\"She was all like, 'I can't wait to fight with you guys to get my scene' – she went in on Nic right away, and everyone was like, 'woah', but she played the game.\" Spencer opened up about his strategy in the house (Photo: Channel 5) \nJust an hour previously, their rival Jessica Cunningham had become the seventh housemate to get booted off. \nShe was sent home after fighting for votes against Bianca Gascoigne, Kim Woodburn, Jedward, Jessica Cunningham and the eternally nominated Speidi (Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag). \nThe crowd waiting outside the CBB house had booed most of the housemates when Emma Willis mentioned their names, with particularly loud jeering being reserved for Bianca Gascoigne following the revelation this week that she has a 'secret' boyfriend on the outside.

It's a really great honour,\" Jedward told the Diary Room. \n\"We've been saved because we're a different flavour - we bring blondness, we bring highlights... we bring intelligence.\" \n\"Thanks to the British public, I'm over the moon,\" said Bianca. Emma Willis revealed the voting was very tight for tonight's eviction (Photo: Channel 5) The crowd had booed all the housemates earlier in the show - especially Bianca (Photo: Channel 5) \nAsked by Emma what happened between her and Kim, Jessica said: \"I think she's alright, she went in there with a different persona. I just felt sorry for her as the other housemates didn't gel with her. \n\"She went in with all guns blazing, but none of them have bothered to sit down and have a conversation with her. I think she's isolated herself and she's going to struggle. \n\"If you don't have anyone to talk to and anything to occupy yourself with, the days are really long.\" \nIt's the second time a housemate was evicted this week, following Stacy's exit on Tuesday night.
