They will eat anything, which is good news for hunters. \nBring The Heat: Pork Chop Media: Esquire \nThey are ridiculously prolific at reproducing, leading some to joke that they are “born pregnant.” Feral hogs that we know today are sometimes confused with the closely related javelina. \nREADY, AIM, FIRE: Texans take aim a feral hog problem with quiet shot in dark \nThey are usually solid black with some brown and red tinges in the coat. You will know them when you see them as they are also quite ugly. \nFor further details be sure to check out the feral hogs section on Texas Parks and Wildlife's website. They have a top notch primer on Texas’ frustrating piggy nuisance. Texas A&M AgriLife Extension’s wild pig website is also an extensive resource for both hunters and those interested in the hog problem in general. \nTake a look at the gallery above what you need to know about hunting one of Texas' most hated creatures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:06:24.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
