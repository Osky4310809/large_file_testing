Spicer clarified Monday that by \"both in person and around the globe,\" he meant that he was combining the crowd on the National Mall with those watching on TV and on electronic devices that have proliferated in the last eight years. \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.
