File MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte is satisfied with the preparations for the traslacion of the Black Nazarene, which is expected to draw millions of devotees throughout the country despite the security warnings issued by authorities, Malacañang said Sunday. As much as 18 million people are expected to attend the traslacion, which commemorates the transfer of the 1767 cross-bearing image of Jesus Christ from Intramuros to Quiapo. Security officials previously warned of possible terror threats to the religious event but assured the public that efforts are underway to ensure the safety of participants. “Well, yes, the president is satisfied and he knows that if there is something that worries him it would be the threat of the retaliation from terrorist groups… Of course, we would not pray that it would happen,” Presidential Communications Assistant Secretary Ana Maria Banaag told state-run radio station dzRB. “It could not be a good precedent to any other big activities in Metro Manila or any other part in the country. So somehow, he knows that the PNP (Philippine National Police), the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) is doing their best, LGUs (local government units) are doing their best to make sure that any threat, any attempt of untoward incident would not push through,” she added. Asked what assurance the government can give to devotees that they would be protected from terror attack, Banaag said: “You know, we are not God who can cover everything. What we will do is not just best efforts but we will truly work on keeping countrymen safe during the procession.” Banaag said security forces are not taking chances even if the PNP has not detected specific threats. “They don’t take for granted any possibility of retaliation efforts from the AKP- ISIS (Ansar al-Khilafah in the Philippines – Islamic State) after the neutralization of their leader. So, with that, they would be putting up measures to avoid any untoward incident,” she said. Banaag was referring to Mohammad Jaafar Maguid, leader of the pro-ISIS terrorist group AKP, who was killed in a clash in Kiamba, Sarangani last Thursday. Duterte and his Cabinet members are expected monitor the traslacion during their first meeting for the year Monday in Malacañang. “We have a Cabinet meeting and we will monitor the traslacion. We pray for the safety of everyone. Don’t worry, the Philippine National Police has been on top of the situation,” Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in an interview with radio station dzBB. Last week, Interior Secretary Ismael Sueno said there is a “strong possibility” that members of the Maute armed group may be in Metro Manila to stage attacks during the Traslacion. Police officials claimed though that they have not monitored specific threats to the religious event, one of the biggest in the predominantly Catholic Philippines.
