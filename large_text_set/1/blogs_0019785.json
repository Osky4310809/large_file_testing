She’s stopped by Radcliffe at the base and she tells Radcliffe how Director Mace reacted when he learned about Aida. May makes it clear that she’s going to destroy the Darkhold when the current crisis has passed. When May leaves Radcliffe calls Aida and tells her to activate the “sunset protocol.” \nWhen May arrives at Radcliffe’s, Aida doses her with a sedative and reveals the May LMD. Aida takes May’s clothes and puts them on the LMD, then she uploads May’s memories into the replacement. Once turned on, the May LMD picks up right where the real May left off. \nMoving up to one day ago, May is in the spa simulation that Aida trapped her in. She keeps trying to leave only to end up back where she started. She eventually assaults the spa attendant. That’s when she wakes up and Aida and Radcliffe are forced to sedate her again. \nToday, Radcliffe and Aida check up on May. Aida asks Radcliffe why it matters if the original May is dead or alive. Radcliffe explains that they need the original May for calibrations, but also that they are not killers, at least not if they can avoid it. Radcliffe mentions their safety net, a second LMD that is now in operation. \nTalbot and Coulson’s team, including Mace, are discussing what to do about Daisy now that she’s public. They plan for Quake to go to the capitol building to sign the Sokovia Accords, and to use the opportunity to put a tracer on Senator Nadeer. Talbot doesn’t like it, but he’s outvoted. \nRadcliffe reiterates that there’s no reason to harm Agent May, then – after checking on May one more time – leaves. Aida breaks a glass vial and walks away to get a broom. May opens her eyes, grabs another glass, smashes it, then begins using a shard of glass to free herself. \nMay and Yo-Yo are enjoying some intimate time together. Mack receives a message and begins dressing to leave. Yo-Yo asks if it's time for the mission, but Mack says he’s had a change of plans. \nMay finds Fitz and asks some questions about Aida’s state of mind. Fitz takes it as May feeling guilt about having Aida read the Darkhold, and he reassures her. \nMay is still struggling to free herself when Aida returns with the broom. Aida is pulled away by Radcliffe, who is being called away for another matter. May continues to try to free herself. \nTalbot continues arguing with Coulson about the Nadeer problem. Mace backs Coulson, but Talbot makes it clear that he sees Mace as Coulson’s puppet now. \nMay gets free and moves through Radcliffe’s home. Aida finds her and attack. May fights back and manages to hurt Aida badly enough to get away. \nQuake and Mace arrive at the capitol. Mace tells Quake that he knows she’s the real deal after hearing Coulson talk about her. Quake says the same thing back at him. Nadeer and Talbot arrive. Nadeer says something ominous before the meeting begins. \nCoulson and Yo-Yo arrive at the capitol. Yo-Yo tries to probe Coulson about Mack, but Coulson says he doesn’t know much and won’t speak for Mack. Yo-Yo turns it around to refer to Coulson’s relationship with May. Yo-Yo uses her power to swipe a key card and sneak into Nadeer’s office. \nSimmons tries to get Fitz to open up about whatever is bothering him, but Fitz remains guarded. Simmons leaves for the mission with May while Fitz continues studying Aida. \nQuake is questioned during the hearing. Nadeer questions her about favoring Inhumans and what happened to the money she took from banks while “undercover.” Nadeer then notes that she was working for SHIELD, even if undercover, without having signed the accord. Coulson and Yo-Yo are caught. Nadeer accuses SHIELD of illegally using Inhumans without United Nations permission. \nCoulson and Quake realize there must have been a leak for Nadeer to know Yo-Yo was there. Talbot tells them there will be hearing. Talbot insists that he is not the leak, and notes that SHIELD only exists because of him. \nMay continues to try to find a way out of Radcliffe’s building. She finds an empty apartment, but Aida catches up to her. May says Aida will have to kill her to stop here and they fight. May kick Aida off the roof, but Aida just disappears. Aida reappears and reveals that the entire escape attempt is in the framework, a simulation. Aida notes that May does better every time, and so May knows that she’ll escape eventually. The simulation restarts. \nSimmons suspects Fitz may be the leak. She grabs his datapad and sees he’s studying Aida. Simmons realizes that Fitz turned Aida back on and that her receptors are probably giving Nadeer info from the base. Fitz says it is not an obsession but an investigation. \nMay leaves and arrives at Radcliffe’s apartment, having realized that it’s her receptors giving SHIELD away. Radcliffe refuses to give the LMD too much more information. May realizes she can’t hurt Radcliffe, and she’s programmed not to want to tell anyone else what she is. \nSuddenly SHIELD arrives in force. Fitz realized that it wasn’t the Darkhold that changed Aida, but Radcliffe. The May LMD is still unable to reveal herself, but Radcliffe is taken away. \nMack returns and Yo-Yo wants to know where Mack went to. He says he went to see his ex. Yo-Yo is upset. Mack opens up and says that he had a daughter, Hope, who died eleven years ago. Tomorrow is Hope’s birthday, and that’s why he was in touch with his ex, Nicole. It let him remember Hope too. Yo-Yo hugs him. \nThe May LMD offers Coulson a drink. Coulson doubts himself, saying he was reckless and should have listened to Talbot. May counsels him. \nFitz visits Radcliffe in his holding cell. Fitz says he wanted to be wrong about Radcliffe. Radcliffe tries to explain himself, but Fitz is unimpressed. Fitz realizes something, grabs a gun from the guard outside, and shoots Radcliffe in the head, revealing he’s an LMD. \nNadeer is watching through the LMD’s receptors. Radcliffe is with her. He realized he was in trouble after Aida failed to retrieve the Darkhold. Nadeer says he’ll have to meet the Superior. \nRadcliffe find Aida, who is with May in a new location. He’s given May a new program to keep her docile, one that traps her the fight in Bahrain where she got the name “the Cavalry,” but this time she managed to save the girl.
