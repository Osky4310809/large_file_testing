But hardcore freckle fetishists can go a step further: They can get these spots tattooed on their faces.\nSemipermanent freckle tattoos use pigment in lieu of ink, can last up to three years and cost about $250, according to the site NewBeauty .\n“I’d say for freckles, it’s clients who naturally will get some in the summertime with sun exposure, but want them yearlong,” Montreal-based tattoo artist Gabrielle Rainbow tells the beauty publication. Rainbow first experimented with faux freckles after seeing her best friend struggling with painting on a smattering of specks on her face each morning.\n“I really don’t recommend tattooing your own face,” Rainbow tells NewBeauty. “But once I saw that it worked out, and I liked the effect, I decided to do hers.”\nMy clients are the prettiest, freshly done eyebrows and freckles on @sarahtellierd. 😍 yes all those freckles are fake 🙌🏻 – #cosmetictattoo #tattoo #permanentmakeup #cosmetictattooing #brows #permanenteyebrows #micropigmentation #eyebrows #eyebrowsonfleek #eyebrowfeathering #cosmetic #permanentmakeup #fakefreckles #tattooedfreckles \nA post shared by Gabrielle ❣ Twin Peonies (@gabriellerainbow) on Dec 27, 2016 at 11:45am PST \nFaux freckles are just the latest beauty trend celebrating so-called “imperfections.” Two years ago, designers and fashion editors went gaga over braces , outfitting their runway models teeth with orthodontia or putting metal-mouthed adolescents on their fancy magazine covers.\nMeanwhile, unruly eyebrows a la Frida Kahlo and thick glasses — a fixture at the always-hot Gucci shows — have become must-have accessories. Two days ago, model India Rose Instagrammed a photo of herself backstage at Maison Margiela’s couture presentation, with the caption, “All I want this season is a show that gives me freckles again.”\nBut while drawing spots on one’s face is one thing, getting them tattooed is quite another. For one, a needle can puncture the skin too deeply, or the tattoo artist can use inks that may cause infections.\n“Because this is your face, it’s important that you do your research and find artists who aren’t afraid to show their portfolio and healed work,” Rainbow tells NewBeauty. “Even if this is ‘semipermanent,’ there are risks.”\nLil shout out to some people who have done wonderful things to my face. @missmelissatattooer for my wonderful #tattooedfreckles to @sydneydyercosmetics for my beautiful #tattooedeyebrows and to @piercerdan for my #septumpiercing and my #philtrum thanks so much guys for making me feel the most beautiful!! 😘😘😘 \nA post shared by Rebecca Martin (@missrebeccajane_13) on Sep 8, 2016 at 9:11am PDT \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:53:25.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
