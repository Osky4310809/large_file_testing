TI: the national taichung metropolitan opera house that we have been working on for 11 years has finally opened. it was quite a big project for me and it went on for such a long period that at times it seemed unrealizable. so now I feel very relieved. I am also working on some apartment and office briefs in taiwan, a condominium project in singapore, a sports stadium in aomori-ken, and I have also started to design a 2,000 seat-concert hall with lots of wooden materials in mito, ibaraki-ken. \ncabinets of materials and drawings line the atelier’s wallsimage © designboom DB: will tokyo be ready to host the olympic games in 2020? TI: despite the short construction period, japanese architectural technology is the best of the world, which would make it possible. however political and cost problems are always talked about in media. through the news we will finally know which facilities will be made for the olympics. there were architecture competitions which were very closed and unclear for international architects, and even for japanese architects, which I feel is shameful. \na selection of carefully crafted project models are displayed image © designboom \n\nDB: this year alejandro aravena won the pritzker prize and curated the venice biennale. as you are involved with the ‘home for all’ program, are you encouraged by the way he has brought humanitarian architecture into the spotlight? IT: I do not know alejandro aravena’s work very well, and I have not been to the venice architecture biennale so I cannot talk about him. however, the change from 20th century architecture to 21st century architecture is apparent. it means that we have entered a new era where the creativity of the author is not as important as it once was, instead there is more focus on a number of external factors. in other words, architecture has begun to have a direct relation to society or normal people, which means that the architect’s role is expanding. \na member of ito’s team hard at workimage © designboom \n\nDB: a recent exhibition at new york’s MoMA celebrated japanese architecture. do you feel that there has been a greater global appreciation of japanese architecture in recent years? if so, why do you think this is? TI: I don’t think that japanese architects are outstanding, I just think that it is harder for young architects to grow and develop in europe and america. as a result, asia has become the biggest market. with that thought in mind, it is possible to say that japanese architects have the advantage of their environment. we have a route where young japanese architects begin by making detached houses, after that they get more and more admired and can start to participate in important competitions. another thing is that japanese contemporary architecture has been strongly influenced by le corbusier, kunio maekawa, kenzo tange and metabolists or arata isozaki who really connect to our generation. from these influences we can trace that lineage, in fact MOMA’s curator said that thanks to these figures young architects have an aim to work towards. \nthe meeting room includes toyo ito’s golden lion, awarded at the 2012 venice architecture biennale image © designboom \n\nDB: yourself, SANAA, and shigeru ban have all recently won the pritzker prize, but how do you feel about japan’s younger generation of architects? TI: there are already some young architects over the age of 40 who are good and will surely receive more prizes and global attention. instead however, I am interested in younger architects around the age of 30 because through them I can observe the changing relation between architecture and society. I feel that there is the potential to create a new architecture which will communicate more to people rather than just making outstanding work. \nportrait of toyo ito inside his shibuya studioimage © designboom", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T12:05:37.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
