Longtime Lana fans will be reminded of the breathy, pared-down romance and grainy Americana aesthetic that launched her career with “Video Games” back in 2011. \nLana plays an old-school lounge singer in the vintage-feeling video, interspersed with shots of pretty young things living and loving at large in an idyllic era. It’s got her signature art-house feel—and then takes a turn for the fantastical, as the whole cast of characters gets transported to a dreamy alien planet.\nWatch Lana head for the stars in the video, above.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:12:19.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
