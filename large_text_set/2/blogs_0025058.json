This simple, unassuming app has changed the way we meet new people. From hook-ups to relationships, to even marriage, all of us know at least one person who’s life has been impacted in some way by Tinder. But, the fact remains, that Tinder is universally seen as a hook-up app. There are opposing views on whether it’s a boon or a bane to relationships. Does it bring people closer? Or, is it simply making us immune to building real intimacy and connections? And what about safety concerns, judgements and the biases when it comes to online dating? We met with Ms. Taru Kapoor, Country Head of Tinder India, to get dope on whether or not it really works in India, and what women, in particular, should keep in mind. Read on... Tinder is seen as only a hook-up app, and so many people feel reluctant using the app. What do you have to say about that? Tinder is how you meet people. We are just an introduction platform. But as Tinder became popular, there's a certain kind of headline that spread faster. There are some stories which are absolutely dreamy, and romantically perfect. Then there is the other extreme. But, the vast majority of stories are the stories in the middle, which is also how real life works. The fear of something new and unknown comes because you haven't seen it for yourself. You've only heard about it. So there are all kinds of questions. What will happen? What will it be like? So, often when you experience it for yourself, that fear goes away. Ultimately, you will only get what you are looking for. Tinder doesn't change intent. What kind of Tinder stories do you get to hear? There are millions of stories being written every day. Whether they are dates, friendships, relationships, marriages… the entire spectrum of relationships have been facilitated. I'm not saying that every person you match with, you are going to have a life changing conversation with, or is going to be your soulmate. But, I think that Tinder opens up a world of possibilities, and in a way, that is in your control. You decide who you swipe right on. And you talk only if the other person has also swiped right. There are no unsolicited messages. You control that conversation, and how much you want to share. Sometimes, you end up sharing a lot, and talking a lot, and sometimes you don’t feel that comfortable. Every match is unique. If you don’t like where it’s going, you can un-match without bothering you in any way. But, safety is a concern for a lot of women. How do you address that? When you meet a stranger in any context, safety is a concern. So, the advice we give people is to apply the same level of discretion that you do offline. So, share your personal information, or any information, as and when you feel comfortable. You can't judge intent beforehand. So, have the same level of discretion. Don't send out money. Meet in a public place initially. Get to know people better. We always encourage people to un-match and report to us, if there's been bad behaviour or anything you didn't like. We actively moderate our community. We warn users if they've shown bad behaviour, and we push them out of the community if it comes to that. The reality is, a minuscule percentage of people, may be unsafe. In fact, what we found is, because safety is a bigger concern online, actually people are more aware and more considerate. So, that works out in our favour. Women are actually far more engaged on Tinder, and that's because of the sense of control that they have over who to talk to and how much. It also gives them the ability to actively connect with someone and say, “hey, I like you”. And of course, the ability to say no. It is very empowering for a lot of women. Do you think India is ready for online dating? It works especially in India, where you only meet people in your immediate social circle, your family, your friends, your colleagues, period. That’s the circle you inhabit. Meeting people outside of that is extremely hard, if not impossible. Even more so for women. You don’t walk up to someone, and introduce yourself. Especially once you are out of college, we all get busier. Friends drift apart. Often, people move. You move to a new city for a job, or whatever, and you suddenly don’t know anyone. So, creating those connections becomes easier with an app like this. Ultimately, life is better because of people, and the connections we have with them. And Tinder gives you the sense of agency. You now have control. You sound positive about how the app is creating opportunities for people to meet. But, there's the other view that it's creating distance between people. What are your thoughts on that? I think that's a view that I don't necessarily agree with. Technology, at the end of the day, is just a tool. When the phone got invented, somebody would have said that now there's no reason to write letters, and how that meant more. But, at the same time, you were able to call someone many times a day, and actually have far more connect. So, there are positives and negatives of every technology. But, I don't think technology by itself makes a difference. It's about how you use it. Tinder makes it easier to meet new people. I can show you hundreds and hundreds of stories where people found life-changing, meaningful relationships online. Ultimately, it's up to people. Relationships fundamentally haven't changed. You still have to get to know someone. You still have to put work in it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:03:05.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
