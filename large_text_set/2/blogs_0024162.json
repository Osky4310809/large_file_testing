Sad! \nAccording to the political news outlet, Spicer held an \"emergency\" meeting with the entire White House communications staff last week — only the meeting wasn't about anything. \nInstead, it was a ruse to get every single staffer in a room, take their government-issued and personal cell phones, and look through all the devices to try to figure out who is leaking so much administration info to the press.\nHe admonished the group of staffers about leaks, after which that meeting immediately leaked out to POLITICO , and now we're reporting on it!\nLOLz!!\nSpicey has lost control of his team!!!\nRelated: Bernie Sanders 1, Donald Trump 0 \nHere's how it all went down, according to the news outlet's leaked source info: \n\"Upon entering Spicer's office for what one person briefed on the gathering described as 'an emergency meeting,' staffers were told to dump their phones on a table for a 'phone check,' to prove they had nothing to hide. Spicer, who consulted with White House counsel Don McGahn before calling the meeting, was accompanied by White House lawyers in the room, according to multiple sources. There, he explicitly warned staffers that using texting apps like Confide — an encrypted and screenshot-protected messaging app that automatically deletes texts after they are sent — and Signal, another encrypted messaging system, was a violation of the Presidential Records Act, according to multiple sources in the room. The phone checks included whatever electronics staffers were carrying when they were summoned to the unexpected follow-up meeting, including government-issued and personal cellphones.\" \nThis administration is horrified and running scared because their own staffers don't believe the bullshit and misdirection they constantly spew .\nAt some point here, heads have to roll.\nIt's becoming abundantly clear that Spicer has not only lost control of his communications staff, but the administration as a whole can't plug leaks coming out of staffers from all corners who recognize Donald Trump 's gross incompetence and repeated problems. \nRead the whole report about leaks and emergency 'meetings' HERE .\nSurely, The Donald can't be happy about Spicer's inability to lead his staff! \nTags: busted! , controversy , donald trump , highlarious , leaks , media minute , melissa mccarthy , oops! , politik , sad sad , sean spicer , social issues , tacky and true , tech talk , viral: news , wacky , white house", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:11:35.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
