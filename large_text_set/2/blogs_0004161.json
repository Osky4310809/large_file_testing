When you run into him, give him a kiss on the cheek (that edges close to his lips) instead of a friendly hug or a handshake.\n2. When you’re at a house party, ask him to do a body shot off of you, so that you have an excuse to lift your shirt and show off your abs.\n3. Or talk about how the party is way too crowded and sit on his lap instead of asking other people to make room for you on the couch.\n4. Rest a hand on his thigh while you’re talking to him, but don’t draw any attention to it.\n5. Give him a compliment that’s clearly sexual, like how you can see his abs through his shirt or how defined the muscles on his arms are.\n6. Whisper something to him when you’re in a crowded room as an excuse to get even closer to him.\n7. Ask him for help zipping up your dress.\n8. Hand him your phone and tell him to type in his number, so that you two can hang out one-on-one someday.\n9. If he hands you his phone, then type in your number and add a cute emoji next to your name so he knows you’re being flirty.\n10. If he complains about being tired or sore, offer him a shoulder massage.\n11. If you’re sitting side-by-side, rest your head on his shoulder. Or, if you have room to spread your legs out, rest your head on his lap.\n12. Reach over to brush lint off of his shirt, wipe an eyelash away, or smooth down his tie.\n13. Ask him what he thinks of the new dress you just bought and then pull up a picture on your phone of you wearing it.\n14. Tell him that he looks like a good kisser.\n15. If you’re already friendly with him, then hug him from behind.\n16. When he gets a new haircut, ask if you can run your fingers through it.\n17. If there’s music playing, grab his hand and lead him to the dance floor.\n18. Wink at him (but practice in the mirror beforehand so you look cute rather than creepy).\n19. When you’re at a bar, order him a drink instead of waiting for him to order you a drink.\n20. Compliment him on his cologne.\n21. When you hug him, wait a little longer than usual before you pull away.\n22. Ask him if he likes the scent of your perfume and then let him get close to sniff it.\n23. If you’re already friends, ask him to take a selfie with you, and then kiss him on the cheek during it.\n24. Get a drink with two straws or a dessert with two spoons, so you can share with him.\n25. Ask him to take you on a date this weekend. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:01:11.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
