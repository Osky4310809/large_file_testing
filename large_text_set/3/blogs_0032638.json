attributes, including \" abnormal beards \" and the wearing of veils in public places.\nWhile China claims that the measures are in place to fight \"extremists,\" many of them appear to cover traditional Muslim custom, and will be enforced in Xinjiang, home to the country's largest Muslim population.\nSEE ALSO: ISIS releases first Chinese-language propaganda with Mandarin chant\nUnder the 15 new rules , workers in public places will be asked to \"dissuade\" those who fully cover their bodies, including the wearing of veils and the growing of \"abnormal beards.\"\nImage: Getty Images\nThe legislation also says people cannot reject \"radio, television and other public facilities.\"\nIt goes on to mention that people will also be prosecuted for \"intervening in others' secular lives.\"\nXinjiang has a population of eight million Uighurs , a Turkic ethnic group that faces growing tension with the majority Han Chinese population.\nDespite measures over the years that appear to discriminate against the Uighurs, China insists that the legal, cultural and religious rights of the minority group are fully protected.\nIn 2014, a city in Xinjiang banned people with beards and those wearing veils from boarding buses.\nImage: getty images\nPresident Xi had earlier this month called for a \"great wall of iron\" to safeguard the western region of Xinjiang, following an Islamic State video that was posted, showing what appeared to be Uighur fighters undergoing training.\nThe fighters announced in the video that they would \"shed blood like rivers and avenge the oppressed\" when they returned to Xinjiang.\nWATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-16860974",
