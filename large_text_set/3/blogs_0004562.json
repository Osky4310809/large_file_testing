I tried with everything I had, pulling away, but I couldn’t free her either.’\nThe force was so strong that she could only be freed when a lifeguard came to switch off the power.\n‘When I pulled her out, her intestine was in my hands,’ Nicola said.\n \nIsabella, on a day out at the theme park Paulton’s Park, in Hampshire in December 2016 (Picture: PA) ‘As a mum, I feel guilty but I had no idea the filter was there. I’d never have put her at risk like that,’ she said.\n‘My priority now is her recovery. I don’t want to let her down again.’\nMan suffers psychiatric episode on tram before falling asleep then dying Thankfully, doctors were able to save her life and she is now recovering from severe injuries to her bowel and intestines after being put into an induced coma.\n \nOn March 3, Isabella woke for the first time, asking her mum to read her a story.\nShe has moved out of intensive care onto a children’s ward where she is doing better.\n‘Nobody can say much right now. We’ve no idea what the lasting impact will be,’ Nicola said.\n‘Her stomach is still open at the moment, so she’ll need surgery to close it up and then we’ll go from there. We’re taking things day by day, but at least it’s not hour by hour anymore.\nNicola’s daughter Isabella, aged three and a half years old, in April 2016 (Picture: PA Real Life) Originally from Waterlooville, Hampshire, Nicola moved to Bulgaria in 2007 7 after seeing an advert and being drawn in by the beauty of the country.\nGovernment suffers second Brexit defeat in House of Lords She met her partner, plumber Hristo Hristov, eight years ago and they tried for a baby for three years before their ‘miracle’ daughter Isabella was born in June 2012.\n‘Isabella is a happy, full-of-life little child.
