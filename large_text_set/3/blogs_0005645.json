Last Updated: 07/03/17 4:09pm They're the top two teams in the Championship and on course for automatic promotion - but how would Newcastle and Brighton do in the Premier League next season? \nRafa Benitez's men are currently top of the second tier on 76 points, five clear of Chris Hughton's second-placed side from the south coast. \nBut how do Newcastle and Brighton compare to teams towards the bottom end of the Premier League? And what changes would both clubs need to make to best prepare themselves for top flight football in 2016/17, should they go up? \nWe asked Sky Sports' Football League expert David Prutton for his viewâ€¦ Newcastle \nHow would they have done in the Premier League this season? \nDP: \"I think this Newcastle side would've stayed up this season in the Premier League and finished in the bottom half. From a character point of view, Newcastle, with Rafa Benitez in their corner, would be in a good place in the Premier League. They'd win plenty of games against teams around them. I think this Newcastle side would've stayed up this season in the Premier League and finished in the bottom half. David Prutton \n\"The question marks come from their ability to defend as a unit at that level, especially at full-back as Paul Dummett and DeAndre Yedlin like to get forward.\" \nWhat do they need to add next season if they go up? \nDP: \"Jamaal Lascelles is going to be a fantastic player but he could do with a bit of experience around him to guide him along next season. Jonjo Shelvey is a Premier League player but it's all about whether he can affect players around him to get the best out of them. To have another midfielder alongside Shelvey who can score goals would be ideal, but they don't exactly grow on trees. They'd need to improve the spine of that team to compete above the relegation places. Watch highlights of the Sky Bet Championship match between Huddersfield and Newcastle \n\"Newcastle will be able to attract the same level of players that the likes of Stoke City and West Bromwich Albion will be in the market for. From a player's perspective he'd be looking to play for Newcastle because of the perceived size of the club, but longevity could play a part as Stoke and West Brom are proven mid-table teams at the top level while Newcastle would have it to prove. \n\"You get the feeling that Benitez wants another crack at the Premier League and to do it on his own terms.\" Brighton \nHow would they have done in the Premier League this season? \nDP: \"I think this Brighton team would be in among the relegation fight if they were competing in the Premier League because there wasn't much between them and Middlesbrough last season. Brighton have more match-winners than Middlesbrough and maybe Sunderland and Hull. David Prutton \n\"Brighton have more match-winners than Middlesbrough and maybe Sunderland and Hull. Although, Middlesbrough did beat Brighton to get to the Premier League and in that regard it's not all about match-winners. It's about having big personalities to win high-stake matches, which is what every single Premier League game is. \n\"There are two ways you can go when you're in the bottom 10 of the Premier League - you can attack it with brute force and physicality or try to create chances by playing your way through midfield. Brighton would probably be in the middle somewhere by being solid without being spectacular.\" \nWhat do they need to add next season if they go up? \nDP: \"They'd have to be able to give Anthony Knockaert the freedom to express himself. Brighton have plenty of energy in wide areas in Jamie Murphy and Knockaert. Knockaert has got a good work ethic which would be crucial if they went up a level. There's a sense of belonging there for Knockaert - and that is shown in the great team spirit there, which would be an asset at the top level. Watch highlights of the Sky Bet Championship match between Nottingham Forest and Brighton \n\"Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy complement each other well. I can see those two progressing well in the Premier League because Dunk will get more time on the ball while Dale Stephens is a very good ball player and has been watched by Premier League clubs. \n\"But Brighton is a brilliant place to be. It's a great part of the world to live and the facilities there are already Premier League standard in terms of the training ground and the stadium.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:27:46.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
