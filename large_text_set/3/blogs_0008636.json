Animals were not euthanized when nothing else could be done for them” after experimentation. \nThe organization’s complaint stems from what they claim is an undercover investigation by a PETA employee who, they say, worked in the lab for six months, beginning in September and ending in February. \nChristine D’Antonio’s Report: \nVideo that the organization says was shot by the undercover employee shows what appear to be monkeys caged in tight quarters, which the organization says subjects the animals to stress. \nAnother shot shows a monkey that the organization says didn’t get veterinary care after suffering an injury, and a rabbit whose knee appears to be cut open and the organization says was trussed with wires for eight weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:49:34.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
