(MANICA Architecture) \nRELATED By RICHARD N. VELOTTALAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL \nThe Oakland Raiders’ deal with New York-based Goldman Sachs to finance a $1.9 billion stadium in Las Vegas is in jeopardy because the agreement was contingent on a $650 million investment from Sheldon Adelson, who withdrew from the partnership Monday. \nAdelson said in a statement that he and his family exited the partnership because the Raiders on Thursday presented a draft lease agreement to the Las Vegas Stadium Authority without the family’s involvement or knowledge. \nBecause Adelson has withdrawn, the terms of the Raiders’ deal with Goldman Sachs have been breached, according to a source close to the agreement. \nAdelson has a long-time relationship with Goldman Sachs. A spokesman for the family said Adelson did not speak with anyone from Goldman Sachs or urge the firm to back out of the deal. \nIt’s unclear how the Raiders will finance the $1.15 billion the private partners pledged toward the construction of the 65,000-seat domed stadium. The balance of the project would be funded by $750 million in bonds repaid by Clark County hotel room tax revenue. Gov. Brian Sandoval has said no additional public money would be allocated to the project. \nThe Review-Journal is owned by the family of Las Vegas Sands Corp. Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson. \nThis is a breaking story. Check back here for updates. \nContact Richard N. Velotta at or 702-477-3893.
