Jacqueline Fernandez did just that, last night. Spotted in an all-black ensemble featuring sheer and lace skirt from Tarun Tahiliani , she looked super fierce. Celebrity stylist Chandini Whabi picked out some fierce jewellery; choker from Swarovski and earrings & ring from Aurelle. A box clutch from Christian Louboutin and a pair of Gucci heels completes her look for the night. \nWe’re in love with this look Jacq! Are you guys? 1 TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:49:11.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
