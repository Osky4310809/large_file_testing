The Acela, which was moving at slow speed, derailed and then sideswiped an incoming New Jersey Transit train, crippling service.\nMore than half of the nine LIRR tracks will be out of commission Friday evening, said MTA officials.\nThey advised riders to leave New York City early or stay late.\n“To avoid delays, customers are advised to leave New York City before 4 p.m. today, or delay departure from the city until after 8 p.m.,” MTA officials said in a release.\nMTA officials also suggested riders head to the Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and leave from there instead.\nMeanwhile, NJ Transit warned its riders that it will have “limited outbound service” from Penn Station. There will be hourly service into the city from Trenton and Hoboken. The agency is cross-honoring tickets on PATH and NJ Transit bus lines to help move commuters.\nOfficials are still investigating the cause of the derailment and crash.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:11:25.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
