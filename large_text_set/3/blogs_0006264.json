Not so with this warm and relaxing space! It manages to feel special and serene while still having personality and function. With a strong focus on the natural light available and smart lighting choices, the whole space feels ready for a visitor! \nA family in River Oaks, Texas enlisted Marie Flanigan Interiors to build a garage apartment for visiting guests and extra work space. Modestly-sized spaces were fitted with unique architectural details, a soft color story, and tailored décor featuring bold textures and industrial accents. The entry features handsome grid paneling, integrated stairway downlighting and a sleek custom handrail, creating an inviting space that sets a well-edited tone for the rest of the spaces to come. \nOnce up the stairs, grid paneling gives way to shiplap paneling which is integrated throughout the majority of the living spaces. Superior functionality and lighting were essential to the success of the home's design and these were achieved through the use of creatively hidden storage, multi-purpose furnishings and the addition of varying light forms. Paneled walls hide closets, cased openings and doorways were accented with shelves for storage and the kitchen table serves as both an island and the perfect spot for guests to dine. \nThe home's main windows were installed facing north and transom windows separate the living areas, allowing the home to embrace all the natural light Texas has to offer. A generous mixture of lighting sources combine beautifully with the home's architectural elements and furnishings, creating the perfect getaway for guests. \nThanks so much, Marie Flanigan !
