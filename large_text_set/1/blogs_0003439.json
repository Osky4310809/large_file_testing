No. The most pressure was in Barcelona,” he said. \n“You cannot compare the pressure in Barcelona and Madrid to Munich or Manchester. Here it is less, much, much less.” \nHis interviews after the Burnley game suggested Guardiola is feeling the heat. \nBut he opened up on City’s hopes, dreams and future to American TV station NBC. \nThere, he hinted that City don’t have the expectation of the likes of Barca, or even rivals Manchester United, because they don’t have the history, and it will take time for him to make them a top club.
