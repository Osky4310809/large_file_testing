Mike Chiari Featured Columnist March 30, 2017 WWE announced Thursday that Tian Bing—the company's first China-born Superstar—will compete in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal on Sunday at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando, Florida. The news was made official with the following post on WWE's Instagram account: A photo posted by WWE (@wwe) The 22-year-old Bing signed with WWE in June and has plied his trade at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando since then.
