Dish has just launched AirTV Player, an Android TV -based streaming media set-stop box that can also be used to view OTA TV stations as well.\nSee also: Best Android TV devices â€“ what are your options? October 20, 2016 The AirTV Player will come with the Netflix, Sling TV and YouTube apps pre-installed, and users can also install any Android TV supported apps from the Google Play Store. It supports media streaming at up to 4K resolution. It also comes with a Bluetooth voice remote. However, you can also get this set-top box with an optional OTA adapter that, when hooked up to a digital antenna (sold separately), will not only show over-the-air TV stations, but will even integrate them into the Sling TV app interface. The nice part is that a Sling TV subscription is not required.\nThe AirTV Player is now on sale, and you can get the box with the OTA adapter for $129.99. You can also get just the box itself for $99.99, and both come with $50 of Sling TV credit, for both new and current subscribers. If you get the box and then later decide to add the over-the-air channels, the adapter is available separately for $39.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T18:20:50.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
