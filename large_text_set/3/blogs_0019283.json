But I certainly feel the benefits of being locked away a bit more this camp.\" Listen to BBC Radio 5 live's weekly boxing podcast \nCrolla believes September's fight turned in the sixth round after one of the hardest punches he has received. \nDefending the WBA title he claimed in 2015, he was beaten for the fifth time in his 39-fight career. \nIf Crolla avenges the defeat, he will also claim the Ring Magazine title, becoming the first English lightweight to do so. \n\"He's a sharp counter-puncher with power in either hand, so I've got to fight using my head and not just my heart,\" added Crolla. \n\"It's very hard to top winning a world title but I believe winning back this world title, when I'm fighting a future hall of famer and for the prizes I'm fighting him for, would go down as one of the most special nights in Manchester boxing.\" \nLinares, who left Venezuela to train in Japan at the age of 17, has held world titles in three weight divisions on his way to a record of 41 wins from 44 fights.
