Lissa Stapleton decided to use the occasion to spread some love and joy into the crowd by proposing to her girlfriend of three years â€“ and co-organizer of the Riverside, California's Women's March,Marcela Ramirez. Shortly after Ramirez gave a speech to the crowds at Saturday's march, Stapleton came on stage to sing Ramirez's praises, and to propose marriage. \"I was totally surprised,\" Ramirez, a Ph.D. graduate student in higher education administration and policy at UC Riverside and UC Regent, told Cosmopolitan.com. Stapleton, a professor at Cal State Northridge, explained how she worked out the surprise proposal with the help of the other organizers from the Riverside Women's March. \"There was a lot of coordinating. I went to the planning team meeting on [Marcela's] behalf and it was the perfect opportunity.\" Ramirez added that Stapleton was \"totally in cahoots\" with her fellow organizers, and she had no idea. Photo credit: Facebook More Stapleton and Ramirez first met in 2006 while studying higher education abroad in Germany and reconnected at a conference in Las Vegas in 2013. \"We happened to be an awards ceremony, and [Lissa] was sitting at my same table, so we happened to reconnect in Vegas,\" Stapleton told Cosmopolitan.com. But they still didn't get into a relationship until later in the year, when they serendipitously met again at another conference in St. Louis. \"The universe brought us back together three times,\" Stapleton continued. Photo credit: Facebook More As for what it meant to them to get engaged during the Women's March, Ramirez said it was a powerful way to demonstrate the values they hold dear. \"I think it's very fitting for who we are and what we fight for and what we stand for that we got engaged at the Women's March,\" she said. \"The love that we have for our queer community, and for our people-of-color community, and our women community. I think it's ideal, actually.\" Ramirez continued: \"People all over the world are coming together to say justice has to prevail. Love will win, and has been winning. One of the things I said during the proposal is who we are, as out women of color, is an act of resistance. Every time we choose to hold hands in public, it's an act of resistance. It felt like a proposal in this space with a lot of great energy and love and with a lot of folks fighting for the same thing, it felt like the right place.\" You can watch the entire proposal here: Follow Laura on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T05:45:15.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
