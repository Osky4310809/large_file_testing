Type B personality . Call us whatever you like, just know that we're going to write a passive-aggressive Facebook status about it later. \nType Bs' tendency to over-think can sometimes prevent us from taking action and get us in trouble. But it's also the main reason why we make better partners: \nWe always think before we act. \nHere are the benefits of earning the love of someone who's stuck inside their own head : \n\nImgur \nAnd that's particularly beneficial if you're on the \"all\" side of the equation. Most introverted people tend to have a small group of people they focus all their love and attention on, rather than spreading it across countless acquaintances. \nThat means you're going to get a much higher proportion of our energy and attention (and therefore love) than with someone who's more of a social butterfly. \nWe'd rather give a few people 100 percent of ourselves, than many people a tiny fraction. \n\nImgur \nAs introverts, we're just more comfortable inside our own head. And as such, we'd rather be receiving information than distributing it. \nThe benefit for you is that you're getting someone who really listens, and isn't just waiting for their turn to talk. And that's how people connect and grow closer as a couple through learning about each other, remembering what matters most to the other person, and feeling as though your emotions are tied to theirs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T05:17:44.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
