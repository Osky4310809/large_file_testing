We’re looking at a future president of the Philippines and if he fights outside the United States and people in the United States and around the world are able to watch his fight without paying any additional money — I think it’s a plus. It puts him on a really different level,” Arum told Mitch Abramson of ringtv.com. \nAmong the destinations on Arum’s mind are the Middle East and Australia, home to some parties reportedly interested in hosting a Pacquiao fight. \nAnd if Pacquiao finds himself fighting Down Under, it will be against Horn, an undefeated prospect who’s the No. 2 contender to Pacquiao’s WBO welterweight championship. \n“If we go to Australia, certainly he’ll be a leading candidate,” Arum said of Horn (16-0-1, 11 KOs), who holds a Bachelor of Education degree from Griffith University.   \n“He’s a great looking kid, speaks very well. He’s undefeated. He’s a tough guy. He has a great back-story, being a school teacher, so it makes a lot of sense,” added Arum. \nFor his part, Dean Lonergan, Horn’s promoter, said Arum has already contacted their camp about a possible bout. \n“Bob has given us a figure for Pacquiao’s fee to fight Jeff Horn,” Lonergan told couriermail.com.au on Tuesday. \nHorn cracked the shortlist for Pacquiao’s next opponent as Arum said a showdown between the Filipino icon and Terence Crawford isn’t likely not happen soon . \nPacquiao reportedly wants a guarantee of $20 million to fight the dangerous Crawford, which could be too much unless it’s going to be a pay-per-view fight. \nIt may not be the same amount Pacquiao will get against Horn, but Lonergan said that coming up with a desirable purse for the Filipino icon isn’t out of reach. \n“While it’s a substantial amount of money, we believe that with the right sponsorships we can make Pacquiao-Horn happen in Brisbane and I believe Jeff can beat Pacquiao,” Lonergan added.
