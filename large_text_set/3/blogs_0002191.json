She appropriately appears in all the family funeral pictures mourning alongside other family families. \nTwo months later, Hunter’s now estranged wife, Kathleen , was out. And now, Hallie is in. \nAs reported by NYP ‘s Page Six, the divorce filings between Hunter and his estranged wife, Kathleen reveal so much more. \nNamely, the family’s got debt because of bad boy Hunter Biden’s questionable spending habits that allegedly involve drugs, hookers, strip clubs, incredible debt and an $80,000 bauble that has disappeared. \nIn 2015, Hunter denied having a profile on Ashley Madison, the dating site for married people, despite the fact that the account was linked to his name and email. \nWhile Kathleen’s filings reveal a den of filth involving other women, a double mortgage on the family home and unpaid taxes, Hunter Biden’s lawyer released a statement that says: “Hunter loves and admires Kathleen as a person, a mother and a friend. He hopes their privacy can be respected at this time.” \nWith five kids involved — three from Hunter’s marriage to Kathleen and two from Hallie and Beau — the family’s hot mess more than pulls at heartstrings. \nTo be fair, divorces are ugly as hell. So likely there are no entirely innocent parties here. \nBut in the meantime, how about those bounced checks to the housekeeper? \nEarlier in the week, news broke that Biden is openly in a serious relationship with Hallie. The couple even enjoys the blessings of Joe Biden and his wife, Jill . \nEvery family has a black sheep. At 43, Hunter joined the military only to leave a year later after testing positive for cocaine use, as reported by WSJ . \nBut not every family has a black sheep who takes up with his brother’s wife after he dies. \nPaging Lifetime….come on, what are you waiting for?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T18:47:37.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
