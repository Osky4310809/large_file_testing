Back on song \nBarcelona have not been at their best this season, with the possible exception of their 7-0 win over Celtic in the Champions League group stage. \nThere are various reasons behind that, but one of the most important is that key players have not been pulling their weight. \nUntil recently, both Luis Suarez and Sergio Busquets have been playing within themselves, but both are starting to demonstrate they have returned to their previous levels. \nBusquets was imperious protecting the back four and constructing Barcelona’s moves, dancing away from yellow shirts and feeding the ball forward. \nAnd Suarez, who looked good against Athletic, continued his personal recovery with two goals here and a display that made him a handful for the defence all afternoon.

Fears Leo Messi could leave \nAlthough, thinking about the matter rationally, it is hard to envisage Messi leaving Barcelona, that doesn’t stop the club and particularly its fans being worried about it. \nOne fan in particular created a banner which read “Messi, stay at your home”. This concern has arisen because contract negotiations between him and the club are being discussed in the media. \nAfter CEO Oscar Grau caused trouble by saying “common sense” was needed when it came to Messi’s new contract, director Pere Gratacos stirred the pot by saying the Argentine wouldn’t be as good were it not for the quality of his team-mates, naming Neymar, Iniesta and Pique. \nHe was stripped of his role on Friday night and, perhaps more by chance than anything else, those players were not included in the line up, although it didn’t stop local media joking that Messi was being given a chance to show he could do it by himself. \nAlthough he didn’t score in the first half he came close, denied by two fine saves from Varas, and another wonderful move which saw him turn away from three stunned defenders led to an effort that flashed across the face of goal. \nThe forward netted early in the second, his 13th goal in 12 games, and by doing so completed his challenge of scoring against every other side currently in La Liga. \nMessi got injured against Las Palmas last season at Camp Nou so this was a nice way to erase that bad memory.

Games adding up \nLuis Enrique made several changes to the team that started against Athletic Bilbao in midweek in the Copa del Rey last 16, ahead of the next round of that tournament this midweek, when they travel to Real Sociedad. \nNeymar and Andres Iniesta were benched, while Gerard Pique and Sergi Roberto were cut from the squad entirely. Jeremy Mathieu returned to the squad for the first time in months, while Vidal made only his second league appearance of the season. \nSpain’s winter break means every midweek between now and the international break in late March is has games in, either in the Spanish cup or in Europe. \nIt means that the fixture list can play a bigger part than it should in a team’s success—if Barcelona had to face a trickier opponent than Las Palmas, this could have been a different story. \nEither Barcelona might have lost the game or been forced into playing a full strength side. Fixtures are piling up for Messi and Co. (Photo: David Ramos) 4. Rafinha benefits from consecutive games \nRafinha was one of the best players on show here and it’s no coincidence that his performance game after starting against Athletic in midweek too. \nHe played reasonably well there and although most thought Denis Suarez might be rotated in, Luis Enrique saw enough to keep the Brazilian in the team. \nThe Asturian was rewarded by a mature, inventive performance from his charge, playing the Iniesta role as best he could. \nAlthough he spurned a good chance in the first half he made up for it by setting up goals for Messi and Suarez in the second. \nToo often the coach has chopped and changed in the centre, with this being the 16th different combination he has tried—Busquets, Gomes, Rafinha. \nHowever, if in the key stages of the season it means the coach has plenty of fit midfield options, it may all pay off. Rafinha impressed at the Nou Camp (Photo: David Ramos) 5. Could Aleix Vidal get back in the good books? \nThe right-back was selected today to rest Sergi Roberto and Aleix Vidal gave a perfect demonstration of why he still has something to offer Barcelona. \nAs well as good defending at times, he put on a nice weighted pass that Gomes reached to help set up the goal that broke the deadlock. \nIn the second half he even got on the scoresheet, a give-and-go with Paco Alcacer saw him rampage into the box and blast a strike into the far corner for his team’s fifth. \nThe Barcelona bench burst out laughing—hopefully because they were happy for him rather than in a mocking way—while Vidal himself was close to tears after netting, celebrating wildly and emotionally with delighted Barcelona fans. \nThere was one moment he let himself down with a bizarre throw-in, giving the ball straight back to Las Palmas, who broke away and were halted illegally by Javier Mascherano, who picked up a yellow card. \nThese slips in concentration are what Luis Enrique holds against him and why it is impossible to imagine him becoming a regular in the team, although in games like these he showed he can still be useful. poll loading Will Lionel Messi sign a new contract with Barcelona? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T19:29:08.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
