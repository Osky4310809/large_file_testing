Tim Minchin's child Trump \nPerforming version of a song from his hit musical Matilda Tim Minchin plays a child Donald Trump. \nOn The Late Late Show With James Corden , Minchin's rewritten When I Grow Up , from Matilda , imagined Donald Trump and his associates Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon, as children in the show Donald: The Musical . \nThe new lyrics did not miss. Minchin, as Trump, sang about how \"when I grow up I'll... ban Muslims, play with Putin's balls/Grab pussies of a lady grown up\" and suggested that, once he repeals Obamacare \"if you choose to be sick, you should just suck it up\". SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Australian composer Tim Minchin should not expect a White House invitation any time soon after his mock musical on a child Trump. Photo: Justin McManus \nOther lines, sung by Corden and actors Abigail Spencer and Ben Platt, mocked press secretary Spicer, who hopes to grow up to \"tell lies, about crowd size\", special adviser Bannon, for being both a Nazi enabler and the brains behind the president, and counsellor Conway, for her willingness to play with \"alternative facts\". \nMinchin, who is no stranger to provocative material being nominated for an APRA Award next month for a song about Cardinal George Pell and the child abuse royal commission, joked afterwards that he \"felt pretty powerfulâ€¦ and quite stupid\" playing the child Trump, while also revealing that his first musical love had been Andrew Lloyd Webber. Advertisement \nWith Matilda already a success, Minchin is looking to join the English musical knight as a consistent hit maker with his new musical Groundhog Day , based on the Harold Ramis film. \nGroundhog Day opened in London in 2016 and premieres on Broadway in April.
