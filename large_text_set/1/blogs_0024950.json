This isn't the first time Wenger has been in hot water over a touchline altercation (Photo: Daily Mirror) \n“I’ve been in England for 20 years, I have seen a lot on the bench, as you certainly know. I think if I am, after 34 years, still in the job it is because I am big enough to stand up for what I do. \n“And I’m big enough to know when I do well and when I do not do well. When I don’t behave like I think I should behave, I’m big enough say ‘Yes, that’s not right’, and that’s it.” \nArsenal's Granit Xhaka is also in trouble — his red card in the Burnley game brings him a four-game ban and he has also been accused of racially abusing an airport worker at Heathrow. Losing banned Xhaka for four games led to an amazing claim from Wenger (Photo: Reuters) \nWenger, who has jumped to the player’s defence over the latter incident, incredibly revealed he told the £35m midfield hardman to stop tackling because he cannot do it properly. \n“I would rather encourage him not to tackle, to stay on his feet and that’s the best way to deal with it,\" said the manager. \"Tackling is a technique that you learn at a young age. You can improve it but when you are face-to-face with somebody, it’s better you stay up.
