Riddled with the sounds of machine-gun fire and an air-raid siren, the opening title track is a torrent of incensed riffage and David Draiman’s bellicose howls. The singer turns downright nasty on “Deceiver,” a tale of love gone to crap, brutally punctuated by double kicks. “Criminal” delivers even more heartache, though this time around the groove is shot through with industrial’s cold mechanization. Customer Reviews The best of the best by Hardcore music fan This is the best disturbed album. Idk why are there albums where taken off and then put back on. But this album is a beast. There is not one song I do not like. Indestructible gives me chills and is my favorite song. This album is a great workout album and this there most heaviest album. Such a good album and totally worth they buy Why only is there only 6 reviews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:44:33.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
