Is that the same thing?” he asked.

Where was my friend Chris when his colleague Van Jones called Trump’s victory a ‘whitelash,’ insinuating all his supporters are racist?” \nHannity noted that the liberal media’s concern is only for itself. \n“Let’s not forget about the lack of concern from Cuomo and others in the media when President Trump was likened to the world’s most evil dictator,” Hannity noted.

And they’re waging this battle by focusing in on superfluous issues, citing unnamed sources. They are basically throwing around allegations in the hope something may stick one day, and they go out there and report breathlessly about whatever the tweet is of the day,” he added.
