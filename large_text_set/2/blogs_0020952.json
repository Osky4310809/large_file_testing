By Matt Bonesteel By Matt Bonesteel February 22 at 8:28 AM Follow @MattBonesteel (AP/Fox) \nNow in its 28th season, “The Simpsons” has had its share of episodes devoted to baseball, but the one everyone remembers most fondly is “Homer at the Bat,” the 1992 episode that features a bevy of MLB stars. And now that episode is headed to Cooperstown. \nThe Baseball Hall of Fame announced Tuesday that it will honor the 25th anniversary of “Homer at the Bat” on May 27 with a roundtable discussion featuring the shows creators plus Hall of Famers Wade Boggs and Ozzie Smith, who both appeared in the episode. \nTo recap: Mr. Burns hires a bunch of MLB players to nominal jobs at the nuclear plant, installing them as ringers on the long-suffering company softball team. Boggs, Smith, Roger Clemens, Ken Griffey Jr., Steve Sax, Jose Canseco, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry and Mike Scioscia all lent their voices to the episode, and all fall victim to some sort of hilarious malady, forcing the team to field Homer and the other plant workers as players. \nArtifacts from the show will be preserved in the Hall, as well: Pictured above, a signed script from @TheSimpsons 'Homer at the Bat' and a tape of the episode, preserved in Cooperstown. #HOFHomer pic.twitter.com/IkSJvaxvQq \n— Baseball Hall ⚾ (@baseballhall) February 22, 2017 \nThe third-season episode, which aired Feb. 20, 1992, is notable not only for its guest-star roster but also because of the fact that it beat NBC’s “The Cosby Show” in the ratings for the first time ever. It also scored higher TV viewership than that night’s airing of the Albertville Winter Olympics on CBS. As detailed in a pretty terrific 2012 history by Deadspin’s Erik Malinowski , the show was one of the more difficult ones for producers to put together given that the ballplayers were recorded separately over a long period of time when their teams swung through Los Angeles. Plus, some of the players (Smith, Sax) were easier to work with than others. Canseco’s wife demanded that his story line — about a “Bull Durham”-esque affair with Mrs. Krabappel — be rewritten, while Griffey had trouble capturing the nuances of lines such as “there’s a party in my mouth and everyone’s invited.” \nBut still, it stands out to many as one of the more resonant “Simpsons” episodes of all time. \n“It ranks right up there, and people are still talking about it today,” Smith told Malinowski. ” ‘ The Simpsons’ are a part of Americana, so to be part of an episode that featured all of those ballplayers from a special time? I guess it’ll go down in history.” sports Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:41:14.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
