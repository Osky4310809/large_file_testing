Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mum-of-three had underage sex with a teenager after he 'tried it on' by sending her a brazen text message. \nThe 14-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - sent her a message asking: \"Would you like to have sex?\" \nA court heard yesterday that he was keen to experiment sexually - and sent the message \"just to see what she would say\". \nChristine Mitchell, 42, agreed to have sex and replied with a text telling him \"okay then\". \nShe later claimed to police that she felt \"under pressure\" - and \"was fed up of saying 'No'.\" \nBut Grimsby Crown Court was also told that after that first time they had sex, Mitchell later gave him \"the eye\" on other occasions - and their sexual behaviour continued for 18 months. \nYesterday Mitchell, originally from the Scunthorpe area but now of Rectory Road, Manchester, admitted three offences of sexual activity with a child between October 2009 and May 2011. \nThe Scunthorpe Telegraph reports that she was jailed for three years - despite \"no element of grooming\". Grimsby Crown Court heard there had been \"no element of grooming\" (Photo: PA) \nCraig Lowe, prosecuting, told Grimsby Crown Court that the teenager was keen to get sexual experience - and sent a text message to Mitchell \"just to see what she would say\". \nIt read: \"Would you like to have sex?\" \nShe sent a reply to him asking whether anyone would find out and, when he reassured her, she sent a text saying: \"Okay then.\" \nBy sending the messages, the boy had \"tried it on with the older woman\", the court was told. \nThey went into her bathroom at her home, where they had sexual activity. \nThere were other occasions when the boy claimed Mitchell \"used to give me the eye\" and they had sex at addresses used by her. \nThe court heard the teenager later claimed: \"I didn't want to do it any more because I was disgusted in myself.\" \nMr Lowe told the court: \"He didn't want to have sex any more. She said: 'Okay'.\" Read More \nMitchell later told police that the boy had supposedly \"pestered her\" and that she felt under pressure, intimidated and too ashamed to tell anybody. \n\"I got fed up with saying 'No',\" she claimed. \nJessica Strange, mitigating, said that Mitchell had struggled to come to terms with what she had done but did eventually faced up to it by pleading guilty. \n\"When he said he wanted it to come to an end, it did,\" said Miss Strange. \nMitchell had been in custody since July and was thoroughly ashamed of her actions. Read More \nJudge Paul Watson QC told Mitchell: \"I accept that this was not a case when sexual activity, to begin with, was initiated by you. \n\"There is no element here of grooming or corruption of the boy concerned. \n\"It's always a serious offence to engage in sexual activity with children under 16. \n\"The law exists to protect children from themselves and you willingly engaged in sexual activity with him on a number occasions. \n\"These offences were extremely serious and only a custodial sentence can be justified.\" \nMother-of-three Mitchell was jailed for three years and was ordered to notify her details as a sex offender for life.
