It's an unfortunate situation we've seen happen after Olympics in other cities , too.\nSEE ALSO: Tokyo will make its 2020 Olympic medals from recycled smartphones\nMaracanã Stadium, the the Rio Games' largest and most recognizable arena, is now deteriorating at an alarming rate.\nWindows inside the stadium have been smashed, copper wire stolen from walls and ceilings, and 10 percent of the 78,000 seats have reportedly been torn up. Even more obviously, the vibrant green playing surface that once held the world's finest athletes is now almost completely bare.\nThe stadium then:\nImage: Buda Mendes/Getty Images\nAnd now:\nImage: AFP/Getty Images\nIt was even reported Rio's electric company cut off power to the stadium in late January in response to unpaid bills in the ballpark of $940,000.\nThe venue, which aside from the 2016 Games has been used by four major Rio club teams and hosted the final match of the 1950 World Cup, has now been completely empty since the conclusion of the Olympics.\nImage: AP/REX/Shutterstock\nThe city's $20-million golf course also doesn't look so great. The Guardian reported that course superintendent Neil Cleverly said his company Progolf hasn't been paid by the Brazilian Golf Confederation for two months.\nFour other venues at Olympic Park also haven't attracted new operators since the end of the games. Two arenas — the velodrome and tennis centre — have been effectively closed down, as they're off-limits to the community and visitors.\nThe golf course then:\nImage: Getty Images\nRight next to the golf course now:\nImage: AFP/Getty Images\nWhile the Olympic athletes’ 800,000-square-meter village remains open, few locals actually want to buy into it. Planned to be public housing after the Olympics, Rio residents find the village to be too expensive, and it now sits relatively empty.\nAn Amnesty study said Rio’s Olympics left “a shady legacy of a city entrenched with marginalisation and discrimination ... and a record of human rights violations where violence remains part of the game.\"\nImage: AP/REX/Shutterstock\nWhile the affluent citizens have benefitted from the games with improved public transportation, Rio's poor suffered, with almost 80,000 residents being forced out of their homes to make room for the games.\n(H/T The Guardian )\nBONUS: Video games in the Olympics?
