Two days of snow, two flashes in the sky, I know the world ends, but I do not yearn,” Tafuri’s prophecy read. \nUnusually cold weather in southern Italy has seen the first stage of his apocalyptic prediction seemingly come true, with the beaches of Salento covered in snow.

A photo posted by Chiara Totaro (@chiaratotaro) on Jan 10, 2017 at 2:16am PST \nAlong with most of Europe, Italy is experiencing an extremely cold period of weather. Unlike the north of the country, Salento in the south rarely sees snow and ice. Schools were closed in the area. At least eight people are reported to have died in the cold weather across Italy, reported the Daily Mail . \nTafuri, who hailed from Soleto, 400 kilometers from Salerno, earned the nickname the “Italian Nostradamus” thanks to his apocalyptic predictions. \nREAD MORE: Cancel your plans: Rare black moon could mean end of world \nBorn in 1492, Tafuri studied philosophy and medicine in Naples before traveling to England, where he was imprisoned on accusations of heresy. After being released he travelled to Ireland, France, Spain and Africa before returning to Soleto where he was imprisoned for witchcraft. \nAfter 15 months, he was released and lived out the rest of his life in his hometown, impoverished and despised by the locals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:15:30.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
