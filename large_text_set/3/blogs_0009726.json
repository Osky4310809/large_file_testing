By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 11, 2017 1:58 PM Punjab Assembly results 2017 are out and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday accepted the people’s verdict in the state. \nPunjab Assembly results 2017 are out and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday accepted the people’s verdict in the state. In Punjab, AAP had given major thrust to win the elections thus expanding its pan-India reach. I am accepting people’s verdict. Party activists have worked hard. Fight will go on, Arvind Kejriwal tweeted this morning. Congress was heading towards forming the government in Punjab, winning 16 seats so far and leading in 60 others in the 117-members state Assembly. \nWith his party receiving a drubbing, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said he would be submitting his resignation to the Governor tomorrow. \nWatch this video \nArvind Kejriwal’s AAP has won six seats so far and was leading in 16 seats while SAD had won in one seat and was leading in 13. BJP was leading in three seats, as per trends available. \nThe AAP today said it is disappointed with its performance in Punjab and Goa and will introspect on the reasons behind it. \nAs per the counting trends, the party was not doing well in Punjab, where it was seen as an alternative to the Akalis and the Congress, and Goa, where it hoped to put up a spirited fight. \n“We are disappointed with the results. We will introspect on the reasons behind the (poor) performance,” senior AAP leader Ashutosh said. \nAAP leader and Delhi minister Kapil Mishra said the party had not expected such results in Punjab and Goa. \n“This was not expected and it its the time to review,” Mishra said. \nHe, however, added that the party has made its impact felt at the national stage. \nAs the counting of votes started in the morning, Atishi Marlena, Ashutosh and other senior party leaders went to Kejriwal’s residence. \nThe party had put tri-colour balloons on the Flag Staff Road, the lane that houses the Chief Minister’s official bungalow, and installed LED screens to show live results. \nParty workers had gathered outside Kejriwal’s residence, but as the trends indicated that party is not winning any of the two states, the crowd started ebbing. \nThe party had put all its might and resources in Punjab and Goa. Kejriwal had himself addressed over 95 rallies in Punjab over the past few months. \n(With agency inputs)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T10:31:39.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
