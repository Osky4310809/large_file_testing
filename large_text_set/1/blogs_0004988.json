It has also been rolling out the final Galaxy Note 7 update in several markets including the United States, this particular update basically bricks the device remotely. The return percentage had been low in South Korea compared to other markets which is why Samsung has had to hold off on tougher measures but with the company having received 94 percent of all units sold in South Korea, it’s now pushing ahead with this update. \nSamsung has said that it’s going to release a new update for the Galaxy Note 7 in South Korea next week. The update is going to cap the battery at 15 percent. It would be an absolute nuisance to get any proper use out of a device that can’t charge itself beyond 15 percent and Samsung would certainly be hoping that this finally compels the holdouts to return their units. \nAs for what caused the Galaxy Note 7 to catch fire, Samsung confirmed during its Consumer Electronics Show 2017 press conference yesterday that the root cause report will be shared with the public “very soon.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T10:49:50.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
