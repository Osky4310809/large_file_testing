Denver will maintain an average ticket price of about $101, putting the team outside the league’s 10 most expensive tickets. \n“We look at it each year and then we kind of staggered increases over time,” president/CEO Joe Ellis told The Denver Post. “I think there came a point where our guys thought our fans had been so loyal and been through so much. It was just the right time to take a break from raising ticket prices.” \nThe Broncos, who own the NFL’s longest home sellout streak at 47 years (nearly 400 games) and whose attendance is composed mostly of season-ticket holders (97 percent), have had variable increases to specific areas each of the last five years. Before last season, tickets were raised on average $3 per game. \nIncluding the playoffs, the Broncos boast a 73-33 record since John Elway took over as general manager, with five divisional crowns, five playoff berths, two AFC championships, a pair of Super Bowl appearances and one Super Bowl title. \nAnd their success has been reflected on the secondary market. \nAccording to TicketIQ, Broncos tickets averaged nearly two to three times face value on the secondary market and, prior to last season, ranked third with an $454 average.
