And what should you really care about? \nEach week, we'll be counting down the five most important things in our world right now. The new gadgets that we're excited about - and that you should be excited about too. The games and apps we're desperate to play - and that we want you to enjoy too. The best phones and tablets and cameras and laptops and smartwatches and all the rest that we've reviewed that week - and that you should go out and buy. \nThink of it as a condensed version of the whole site. But don't forget to read the rest of it too, eh? 5) Triby puts Alexa in a radio shell \nGot yourself an Amazon Echo ? Well, by now you’ve probably unearthed its one major flaw: it doesn’t look like a DAB radio. \nThankfully, we’ve now got the Triby IO to fulfil that need. Alexa-equipped, it’s pitched as a hub for your smart home that’s capable of doing all sorts of clever stuff - from smart tech interactions to hosting messages and memos for your family. \nTalk to it and you’ll get the same smarts as an Echo, as well as IFTTT support - meaning it’ll handle your Philips Hue lights, Belkin WeMo cooker and more. \nIt’s meant to be much more portable than the likes of the Echo, too, hence the handle and compact form factor. There’s audio to match its radio shell as well, with Spotify Connect and Audible compatibility, making it quite the nifty carry-around. Not a hat Alexa-equipped Triby IO could be the easiest way to control your smart home 4) The “we don’t need these but they’re probably fun” headphones \nIf you’ve ever listened to a song and thought, “I wish I knew where that sound was coming from” then these in-ears from Sennheiser are for you. \nThey’re equipped with clever tech that means they’re capable of processing and playing binaural audio - basically 3D sound that puts you, the listener, right in the middle. \nUnlike stereo, binaural audio replicates real-world differences in resonance, volume and the like to virtually recreate the physical location of the sources. \nThe coolest bit? These buds are equipped with microphones, too, so you’ll be able to make VR recordings of your own. \nBecause there’s no straightforward way of converting standard stereo tracks into binaural, the actual usefulness might be limited - but we’re still excited to stick VR in our ears.
