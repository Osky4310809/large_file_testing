(AP/Doug McSchooler) After New York Knicks point guard Derrick Rose went MIA (missing in action) on his team against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday, many suggested that an off-court turmoil between him and head coach Jeff Hornacek might have been the cause. The one-time league MVP has since apologized and reported back to his team and will not face any disciplinary actions, except for a fine of an unspecified amount. ADVERTISEMENT READ: NBA: Rose fined, back with Knicks after mystery absence On Wednesday, Rose quickly shot down rumours that he and his mentor are not getting along, assuring everyone that these supposed ‘frustrations’ are being blown out of proportion. “I’ve never had a problem with a coach in my life,” the 28-year-old speedster told ESPN’s Coley Harvey . A few days before his absence, Rose reportedly grew irate with Hornacek after being benched in the dying minutes of the team’s road victory against the Milwaukee Bucks over the weekend. Instead of Rose, Hornacek elected to go with seldom used third-string point guard Ron Baker. However, the three-time All-star still insisted that his nonappearance was over a family matter and had nothing to do with basketball. For his part, coach Hornacek said he had no qualms about Rose leaving for a family matter, but wished he would have at least contacted the team before doing so. “I haven’t experienced it, but with family issues and concerns sometimes, are you thinking about everything else at that point?” the first year Knick coach said. “The concern is for your family. He went back (to Chicago) – we would have loved for him to at least call and tell us that – but it is what it is.” Rose is expected to suit up against the Philadelphia 76ers at Well Fargo Arena on Thursday.
