January 3, 2017, 11:07 AM Dimitri Filipovic January 3, 2017, 11:07 AM \nAt this point of the season, the NHL standings still look like one big jumbled mess. Sure, there’s a handful of teams on either end of the extreme that have started to distance themselves from the pack. We can say with a reasonably high level of confidence that the Pittsburgh Penguins are once again strong and the Arizona Coyotes most definitely are not. \nBut aside from those select few, the picture is murky. That’s largely by design, with the league remaining steadfast in its misguided beliefs that the current (loser) point structure and the resulting competitive balance are good things. \nIt’s easy to see how they’d stand to benefit from feeding that message to their fans. Take the Vancouver Canucks for example, who are unquestionably one of the worst five teams in the NHL by essentially any possible measure. Yet they’re only technically one point out of a wild card spot in the Western Conference and that’s the type of false hope they can go and sell to diehard fans. \nSo, it’s up to us to avoid being fooled by being proactive in sniffing out which teams are legitimately good and which are just hanging around because of good fortune and circumstance. One way to accomplish that is to sort through shot metrics and PDO (a combination of shooting percentage and save percentage). By now most people understand this measure and are familiar with past mirages we’ve been able to sniff out over the years. \nSomething else we can do is peel back a layer and look at whether there’s any substance to a specific team’s results, or is it’s mostly just fluff. To do so, here’s a breakdown of how frequently individual teams have been leading versus trailing in the games they’ve played: TEAM 16.10 48.78 \nThere are a couple notable takeaways here. Conveniently they both reside in the hotly contested Atlantic Division, which at this point is as difficult to figure out as any. \nThe company the Tampa Bay Lightning are keeping is at the very least worthy of an eyebrow raise. They’re approaching the distressing 40 per cent mark in terms of time spent playing from behind, which is only rivalled by the true bottom-feeders of the league (the Avalanche, Canucks, and Coyotes are the only other teams that have spent a larger share of their games trailing). \nThis is an unfamiliar spot for Tampa Bay, considering the universally lofty expectations we had for them coming into the season. \nPart of their struggles can surely be chalked up to the glut of injuries they’ve had to deal with up front. Not only have they badly missed Stamkos’ presence as a gravitational pull on opposing defences, but they were without their entire top line (Ondrej Palat and Nikita Kucherov included) for a chunk of time in December. \nStill, even then it’s tough to reconcile just how abjectly underwhelming their performance as a team has been all year. They’re currently barely hovering around the 50 per cent threshold in any five-on-five metric, whether it be shots, scoring chances, or goals. \nThe one silver lining for them: beyond the Canadiens, it’s not as if any other team in that division has taken their spot and run away with it yet -- only four points separate spots two through six right now. Maybe it’s wishful thinking that’s too reliant on past performance, but based on the talent alone you’d think the Lightning should still be considered as good a bet as any Atlantic team to secure one of those remaining playoff spots by season’s end. \nThis is a perfect pivot point to the Toronto Maple Leafs , who find themselves on the opposite end of the spectrum on the chart above. They’re in great company here, with only the Blue Jackets and Capitals having spent more time with the lead. \nThe issue for the Leafs, though, is they haven’t been able to translate that into the same type of success in the win-loss column as the other two. That discrepancy can be accounted for by their struggles in games decided by just one goal, which only the Coyotes have been worse at converting into points: TEAM", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T18:27:25.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
