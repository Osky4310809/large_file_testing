A quick look around the room shows off some other great gear, including a lovely record collection, a media server for the house, and more.

Very solid desk! \nAudio consists of an X-Fi sound card connected to two sources. On the desk is an SMSL SA-60 amp with a pair of Dayton Audio B652 speakers. The Grado SR80e headphones are connected to the amp in the next photo. \nThe monitor is an Asus 23\" IPS (MX239H). Keyboard is a CM Storm TKL with Cherry Reds and WASD custom keys.

Here’s a shot of the whole office, complete with the record player, mounted records on the wall, and the shelf with the rest of his collection: \nI love someone who loves music while they work—or while they play, and this workspace is ideal for all of the above. There are a few more photos in the gallery below, including one of a great-looking media shelf that’s full of movies and other interesting tidbits, and another featuring the resident of one of the turntables...at least the one who has to get out of the way when scruffycowendale wants to use it. Trust me, they’re adorable. Advertisement \nHit the link below to check out more photos, and to visit the full thread at the battlestations subreddit.
