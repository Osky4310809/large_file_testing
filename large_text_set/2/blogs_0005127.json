The 70-year-old veteran pulled out his own gun and shot at both of the men as they attempted to rob him. The 19-year-old suspect was killed and the 23-year-old was injured during the encounter. \nIt’s never good when someone loses their life. \nHowever, this 70-year-old Vietnam veteran looks like he certainly was about to lose his. \nAre you going to sit him down and tell him that he shouldn’t have had the right to survive in that instance? \nI don’t think so. \nYet another example of how important it is to understand the Constitution.
