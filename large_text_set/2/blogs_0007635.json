Since the challenge wasn’t incredibly popular the first time, and people are making new videos again, it seemed like a perfect time to cover some of the best examples. \nTo do the #BookBagChallenge, all you have to do is run through a gauntlet of classmates who are all throwing their backpacks at you. If it sounds like one of the stupidest challenges yet , that’s because it IS. \nDon’t try this at home and don’t ask people to hit you in the head with a bag of books. You'll get a concussion, you dummies. 1. \n— yung bull$❤️ (@jayygotpesos) December 9, 2016 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:41:48.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
