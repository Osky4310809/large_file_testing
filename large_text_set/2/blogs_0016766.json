In an interview with the San Diego Union Tribune ,WNBA star Candice Wiggins says that being in the WNBA was horrible for her, because all of the intolerance shown by gay people. She said: “Me being heterosexual and straight, and being vocal in my identity as a straight woman was huge… I would say 98 percent of the women in the WNBA are gay women. It was a conformist type of place. There was a whole different set of rules [the other players] could apply.” Not that being straight was the ONLY reason her teammates harassed her. “There was a lot of jealousy and competition, and we’re all fighting for crumbs…” she said. “The way I looked, the way I played – those things contributed to the tension.” But on top of all this, she was physically thrown to the ground: “People were deliberately trying to hurt me all of the time. I had never been called the B-word so many times in my life than I was in my rookie season. I’d never been thrown to the ground so much. The message was: ‘We want you to know we don’t like you.'” This is ridiculous! MJ Randolph on Truth Revol t put it best: Wait one minute… Has anyone checked with Lady Gaga to find out if it’s even possible to be a heterosexual victim of harassment? After all, black activists claim white people can’t actually be mistreated for their color, under the misguided pretense that racism cuts only one way. Of course, the truth of the matter is this: homosexuals can be just as intolerant as anyone else. But her treatment does beg the question: Why are organizations so dominated by liberalism such cesspools of intolerance? Really, America?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:24:03.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
