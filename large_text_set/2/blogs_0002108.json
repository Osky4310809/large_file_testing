The townhouse is about 2,200 square feet and the exterior is what I'd like to call pre-recession tuscan (it was built in 2007 and was probably inspired by the original Real Housewives of the OC, but on a much smaller scale). I'm only a few blocks from Hermann Park and the Centennial Gardens, which is a beautifully landscaped park in the middle of Houston. I describe my style as tailored maximalism - I'm a huge art collector and love pieces with strong stories, but I try to keep the house comfortable and livable. I'm inspired by Georgian/Federal design as well as the '70s, and I have tried to combine elements of both styles. \nI'm originally from New Orleans, which also inspires me through my art and the notion that grand spaces can be really easy-going. I am an avid DIYer so you'll see a lot of my work around the house from paintings that I've painted or framed, to the headboard I built, or the dining room table I refinished, to the curtains I've sewn, or the stools and chairs in the living room that I've salvaged and reupholstered. I'm also fairly big into wood-working, but sadly I don't have the space for my projects, so they end up at friends' houses. \nMy favorite room is a toss up between my bedroom and my living room; I love the light in the living room as well as the freshness that the green of the curtains bring in. The windows of the living room are in the tree line, so it's like my own little treehouse. My bedroom is soothing and filled with moody art pieces that really set the tone. \nThanks, Christian ! \n• Interested in sharing your home with Apartment Therapy?
