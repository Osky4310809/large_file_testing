UConn Women’s basketball. Despite their top three players from last year going 1-2-3 in the WNBA draft, this team is as good as ever. The Huskies got their record in dominating fashion, starting the game on a 21-0 run and winning 88-48 against SMU.\nTo honor the achievement, Nike put together a pack for the team including an exclusive colorway of the Kyrie 3 which represents the team colors, as well as a t-shirt and sticker set. \n91 straight deserves a cultural moment. #Kyrie3 @uconnwbb \nA photo posted by Kyrie Irving (@kyrieirving) on Jan 14, 2017 at 4:30pm PST \nThe team received the packs after the game as part of their celebration. Gabby Williams was sure to get a “Go Cavs!” in as a thank you to Kyrie Irving.\nCongrats ladies on a great feat!! Keep inspiring. @uconnwbb \nA video posted by Kyrie Irving (@kyrieirving) on Jan 14, 2017 at 4:33pm PST \nThe Huskies have a chance of being on a 107-game winning streak going into the NCAA Tournament. If they go on to win the tournament, they will finish with 113-straight wins and 5 consecutive National Championships.\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T04:58:52.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
