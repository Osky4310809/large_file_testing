(ABC News) \nDuring the war he flew Defiants, Beaufighters and Mosquitoes over Britain, Malta and France, and survived several very close shaves during 68 aerial missions. \nPerhaps the closest of all was plummeting through the night sky while unconscious, after shooting down an enemy plane. \nThe enemy aircraft exploded with such force it sent his own aircraft into a spiral, forcing him to bail out. \nMr Cowper lost consciousness, but regained it just in time to open his parachute. \n\"I remember putting my hand down to see if my parachute was still there,\" he told the ABC in 2007, the year his autobiography was published. \n\"I pulled the rip cord and the parachute opened. \n\"I must have travelled a fair way down, because it was only a matter of a few seconds, almost, and I was in the sea.\" \nOn another occasion Mr Cowper's plane, which was carrying top secret radar, crash-landed in the Sahara Desert but the crew was rescued by a local tribe. \nIn 1944, he became flight commander of 456 Squadron and also earned the title of 'ace', bestowed on pilots who shot down at least five enemy aircraft. \nHe destroyed six, damaged another and also claimed co-credit for destroying a V-1 flying bomb. \nMr Cowper and Kay were married for almost 70 years, with Kay giving birth to the first of several children before the conflict was over. \nOn his return home, he lived on the land, trained racehorses and represented veterans. \n\"Most of the ones that we killed, shooting down in their aircraft, were young fellows doing what they were told by monsters,\" he said in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T15:28:12.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
