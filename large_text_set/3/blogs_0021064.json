Visualizing The World's Extreme Population Density Mar 20, 2017 9:50 PM 0 SHARES \nYou may have heard that the majority of the world’s population actually lives within a relatively small circle that covers China, India, Japan, and other parts of Southeast Asia. That’s a pretty extreme example of population density – but, as Visual Capitalist's Jeff Desjardins points out , here’s one that is even more impressive. \nIt’s quite simple actually: it compares parts of the most expansive regions (Canada, Russia, non-coastal USA, Greenland, Australia, and others) with a tiny chunk of land that holds close to 400 million people. AN EXTREME COMPARISON OF POPULATION DENSITY \nThe following image comes to us from Metrocosm , the website of data visualization expert Max Galka . \nBangladesh and three provinces in India, which are highlighted in red, take up just 160,000 sq. mi (415,000 sq. km) – that’s smaller than California. Together they hold more population than all of the blue territories on the map. \nThat’s right, the blue area contains the entirety of many significant countries, such as Canada, Australia, Norway, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia. The blue even includes parts of China, the United States, and most of Russia. GETTING MORE EXTREME \nHere’s the kicker – the disparity is only getting more intense.
