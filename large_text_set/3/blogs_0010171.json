McKeesport’s Planning Commission also recently approved a company’s proposal to build a growing facility at a former industrial site, and the state Department of Health is expected to soon award licenses to companies to operate dispensaries or growing operations. \nNow, Braddock, like McKeesport, is hoping to turn one of their sprawling industrial lots into a growing and processing center. Update: Braddock Council votes to approve medical marijuana facility. Residents came with resumes in hand pic.twitter.com/P4D8CkmJpD \n— KDKA Kym Gable (@Kymgable) March 14, 2017 \nEarlier in the day, the borough’s mayor and a Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Steeler joined forces to make a plea for approval. \n“This medical marijuana facility and processing plant is ideal for Braddock right here in this spot,” said Steelers legend, Franco Harris. \nHe is part of a new team that is applying to the state to build such a facility in Braddock, which has joined nearby McKeesport in seeking a license to grow. \nHarris was joined on site Tuesday by the plan’s biggest supporter. Mayor John Fetterman says he believes medical pot and the jobs it brings could pull the struggling town out of distressed status known as Act 47. \nKDKA’s Andy Sheehan Reports: \n“The decline of one industry, steel, dragged us into Act 47 and the emergence of a brand new industry, medical marijuana, could be the thing that brings us out of it,” said Fetterman. \nBut both Braddock and McKeesport will face some stiff competition. The Board of Health has divided the state into six regions and will allow only a limited number of licenses in each. \nIn the 11-county southwestern corner, for instance, applicants will vie for only two grower/processor permits or one of only five dispensary permits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:41:25.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
