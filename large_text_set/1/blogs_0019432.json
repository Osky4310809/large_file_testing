The sites are designed to help the locations share best practices and information, forming a core community that Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx hopes will help spur the collective progress of autonomous vehicle development. \nThe list or proving grounds were narrowed from an applicant pool of over 60, which included a range of different types of organizations including privately held facilities, enter state transportation departments, municipalities and cities and academic institutions. The choices, in the end, were made by the DoT based on a number of factors, including a healthy mix of conditions and facility types, with the aim of building a final designee list that can provide a range of testing scenarios and share that data collaboratively with one another. \nFederal designation gives these initial pilot program members a chance to help set the national tone on autonomous vehicle and systems standard in the U.S.: They’ll likely be instrumental in helping the DoT establish its further recommendations and guidelines for companies developing autonomous vehicle tech, and help establish the process through which self-driving arrives on U.S. roadways for consumer and commercial uses. \nHere’s the full list of all 10 pilot designated proving grounds: City of Pittsburgh and the Thomas D.
