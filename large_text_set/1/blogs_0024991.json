Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire/PA Images ID: 10419169 Speaking to Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron also said that the state visit invitation should be rescinded.\n“It should be withdrawn, it should never have been made in the first place. That’s not to say we are wrong to go to talk to Donald Trump. I’ve often said in international relations if you only spend time with the people you share values with you will be very lonely and achieve very little,” Farron said.\n“What I am opposed to is Theresa May, when she should have gone over to the States to defend our corner and stand up to Donald Trump, she’s gone over there and held his hand and to be seen now to offer him a royal audience in the United Kingdom.”\nTory MP Sarah Wollaston is among those calling for the scope of Trump’s planned state visit to be limited, in a series of tweets in which she called the US president a “sickening piece of work”.\n1. On his forthcoming State visit I don't think Trump should be invited to address both Houses of Parliament from Westminster Hall\n— Sarah Wollaston MP (@sarahwollaston) ID: 10418903 2. Westminster Hall has great significance & should be reserved for leaders who have made an outstanding positive difference in the world\n— Sarah Wollaston MP (@sarahwollaston) ID: 10418904 3. That doesn't include Mr Trump.\n— Sarah Wollaston MP (@sarahwollaston) ID: 10418906 Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas meanwhile said she was pleased the petition calling for the state visit to be cancelled had passed the 100,000 mark, and that she was looking forward to a debate “where MPs can call out PM for complicity with tyranny”.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sarahwollaston/status/825409633024143361", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/825406536142954496", "https://twitter.com/CarolineLucas/status/825685877305262080", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/825407614771138560", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/825407203003736064"], "published": "2017-01-29T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T18:21:54.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
