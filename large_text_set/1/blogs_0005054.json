F--- white people!\" \nThe victim can be seen squatting in a corner with his mouth duct-taped, and his hands and legs apparently tied up. His clothes are partially cut at one point, he is threatened repeatedly, and a part of his hair is cut down to his scalp causing a bleeding wound. \n\"It's sickening,\" Eddie Johnson, Chicago police chief, said at a news conference announcing that the four suspects were being held pending formal charges. \nPolice had not yet determined whether the incident constituted a hate crime or if there were political motivations behind the attack. \nThey were also still trying to determine whether the victim was kidnapped, saying he was traumatised and was having difficulty communicating with investigators. \nAuthorities said the victim had been released from a hospital.
