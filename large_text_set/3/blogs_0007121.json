AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, File \nYahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has said she wants to stay at Yahoo after its $4.48 billion acquisition by Verizon is completed later this year, but no one knows for sure what she'll do. \nHer best bet might be to dive into an area she's never officially been a part of: venture capital — according to Pitchbook data, Mayer has been a prolific investor since 2009 . \nThe tech industry expects her to move on. One likely scenario is that she'll become a VC, or just increase her angel investing and startup advising. \nThe bigger question is: Will another company want her as CEO? She hasn't proved herself to be a turn-around-to-growth CEO. And some could even argue that she wasn't even a turn-around-to-sale CEO. This sale came from pressure from an activist investor rather than Mayer's own grand strategy. \nIn order to help her pursue her next thing, résumé-writing startup Enhancv.com has done up a sample résumé for her. \nThere's no question that Mayer looks good on paper. But if you look closely at this résumé, then you'll find a few zingers in there. For instance, it says \"acquired Tumblr for $1.1 billion and moved the company's blog there\" an acknowledgement that her big bet on Tumblr wasn't a runaway success. \nThere's also a nod to Mayer's rather famous, over-the-top, perfectionism/micromanagement style under \"A day of my life.\" See where it talks about creating spreadsheets for cupcake recipes? \nAccording to a profile on her in 2008 in San Francisco Magazine , when Mayer decided to bake some cupcakes she went about it like this: She \"bought an array of cookbooks to study the cupcake recipes in each, created a spreadsheet for the ingredients, and then tested the recipes before writing her own . . . (She made another spreadsheet for frosting.)\" \nAfter looking over her credentials on this résumé, would you hire Marissa Mayer? \nA résumé for Marissa Mayer. enhancv.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T18:40:36.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
