I have a 2 month writing/ guitar trip to Cadiz (Spain) planned in the summer which is very exciting, followed by some Autumn shows in Europe. Then it's back to the studio in London to prep more music this year. \nWhat was the first gig you ever played and whatâ€™s been the best so far? \nThe first gig I played was to a group of school friends when I was about 16. I played one of the first songs I ever wrote and a couple of covers. It's all a bit of a blur - I just remember bricking it with nerves! I guess the best show to date may have been my first headline show back in December 2015. \nIt was at Proud Camden with dear friends from the phenomenal Wovoka Gentle playing as my band. I was blown away by the turn out, and it felt like a baptism of kinds for Blanco White as a project. \nColder Heavens, the new EP from Blanco White, is out on 31 March via Yutacan Records. He plays Electric Brixton in London on 9 March (supporting Tinariwen) , Omeara supporting Nathan Bell on 15 March, and a headline gig at Troubador in London on 29 March.
