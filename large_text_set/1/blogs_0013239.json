After telling the video team that he gasped when seeing Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot on set, Momoa was asked about his favorite Justice League member. \nImmediately, without missing a beat, Momoa said it was The Flash . He then clarified that The Flash was his favorite because he loved Ezra Miller so much. \n\"He's like my little brother.\" \nThe relationship between the two actors probably stems from the fun and crazy times they both tend to have on set. Miller is known for being a goof ball, and Momoa admits to being the very same way. \nLater on in the video, the actor is asked about his worst habit on set. He qucikly responds that he likes to mess around with his co-stars. Momoa says he often plays pranks on set. \nEven though Aquaman and The Flash seem to be getting along better than most, the Justice League is currently gearing to show the world the good they can all do together. Their first live-action film is hitting US theaters later this year. \nJustice League hits theaters on November 11,   ) ComicBook Anticipated #2 Best-Rated Before Release Anticipated Rating", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T05:27:39.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
