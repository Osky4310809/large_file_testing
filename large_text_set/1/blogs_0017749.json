Whatever your politics, poetry can help. As President John F. Kennedy put it, “If more politicians knew poetry, and more poets knew politics, I am convinced the world would be a little better place in which to live.” That’s likely why JFK invited the poet Robert Frost to read his poem “ The Gift Outright ” at the inauguration in 1961. Since then, several presidents have invited poets, including Maya Angelou and Elizabeth Alexander, to take the dais in Washington DC. To commemorate this year’s Inauguration, we asked five poets to write, read and record a piece for the occasion.\nOath \nby Rives https://tedideas.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/oath.mp3 \nThe Presidential Oath of Office seems quirky — it’s in the US Constitution but fewer than 50 citizens have ever actually taken it. I customized it a little. — Rives \nI do solemnly swear\n(I’ve been swearing a lot)\nI will faithfully execute\n(ready or not)\nthe office of resident\n(right where I count)\nof the united states\n(a tremendous amount), \nand will to the best\n(or at least like I floss)\nof my inborn ability\n(not like a boss), \npreserve, protect\n(the big, the small of us)\nand defend the constitution\nof freaking all of us. \n2053\nby Jamila Lyiscott “The purpose of this piece is to inspire and sustain those of us committed to authoring hope, equity and justice into our immediate future. My impetus for framing the poem in the future is to remind us that we can claim victory, take ownership of the narrative of democracy and forge a different reality into existence if we can envision it now.” — Jamila Lyiscott \nMinutes before the January 20th 2053 inauguration\nMy grandbabies and I will be tuned into the worldwide news hologram station\nEager contemplation\nHeadlines scrollin’ by about the history of our nation\nMy granny grays showin’ them that I survived back in the days\nSo they pumpin’ me for historical information\nLike, “Granny…\nWere you there during the divided state of America?\nMy history teacher says that the social climate was lethal\nThat the country bled\nIn a curious shade of red\nUnder the principle of profit before people\nThat you were trapped in a bad storyline\nLike a cinematic sequel\nMy history chip says that deepening social silos sustained\nHate, division, and misogyny\nThat social safety was severed by a stratified economy\nThat the world around you felt more and more one-sided?\nAnd no one knew what to do when the indivisible was so profoundly divided\nMy ‘Real D History Hologram’ app says that hyper-racial hatred hacked away at the hope of the people\nThat there was a time when you had to choose between being different and being equal\nIt said that they would snatch the breath from the lungs of an innocent Black body on a Tuesday and shrug it off as historical retribution\nThat healthcare became a game of Russian roulette–style execution\nBut granny, what happened? This is all so confusin’\nThis history I’m perusin’\n‘Cause today we livin’ in the United States of Inclusion\nAnd I don’t understand at all\nI even read some trumped up nonsense about an attempt to build a wall\nMy ‘Real D History Hologram’ app took me back to the days after the 2016 election\nDays filled with protests and misconceptions\nDays that led to the deepest unity of the people to take the country in a new direction\nHow you pushed through such uncertain times is just a mystery\nIs this real or, granny, is this trumped up history?”\nAnd I will say\nbaby\nIn the year 20-and-17\nWhen the putrid stench of polarized politics tried to render us broken\nTried to block our seat at the table until we broke in\nTried to asphyxiate our choices\nTried to Ursula our voices\nWe the People\nBelieving in the possibility of a more perfect union\nStood at the precipice of pandemonium and fought for a palpable peace\nWe stitched together a quilt of hope out of every fiber of our being\nWe juxtaposed our journey with a history of healing\nWe organized for all types of equality\nRestructured the economy\nUprooted false ontologies and toxic ideologies\nWe the people\nLoved each other like the broken skin of a god\nAnd by disarming any disease to our true democracy we beat the odds\nWe the people\nFaced our flaws\nAnd became critically conscious about our collective care\nWe did not back down in the face of bigotry or waver under the fallacies of fear”\nJust minutes before the January 20th 2053 inauguration\nWhen the world is tuned into the international news hologram station\nMy grandbabies will want to know how we overcame\nI will tell them\nThat healing is not the absence of pain\nIt is the decision to act in the service of your development\nRather than your defeat\nDrawing the Line Between \nWhat We Lost & What We Want \nby Ben Burke https://tedideas.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/drawingthelinebetweenwhat.mp3 This poem is a response to tragedies I experienced at home and abroad this year—from the attempted coup in Istanbul and the bombing of Ataturk airport, to demonetization in India, the aftermath of the earthquake in Katmandu and then finally the Ghost Ship warehouse fire in Oakland. And more. Like many, I’m left with the questions “How did we get here?” and “Where do we go from here?” So this is a poem for anyone who has found themselves running ragged, trying to put the pieces back together or trying to keep them from falling apart in the first place. I often worry that so many of us put our work ahead of our health, and every year it becomes clearer that the government is a poor place to turn to for help, especially if you’re not in good health. I’m hoping that our big take-away from this year, and particularly the recent election, is that all we’ve got is each other. A revolution needs healthy soldiers. We can’t take care of business if we’re not taking care of ourselves. And there’s a lot of business for us, the people, to take care of in the coming years. — Ben Burke \nThe world doesn’t need my poem.\nAt least,\nno more than it needs your shoes.\nIt doesn’t need your movie,\nyour painting,\nit doesn’t need you banging and scraping.\nIt don’t need the things that we use.\n.\n“There is nothing they can give me,”\nthe World told me,\nas we sat in the back seat and watched.\n“I mean they’re great.\nAnd I don’t need nothing- \nI need something-\nBut not much ,”\nsaid the World.\n“No, not much.”\n“But\nI can’t believe it,”\nit said,\n“Are they nuts?!\nWhat the fuck?\nI mean, just\nlook how fucking much they’re doing!\nSpeaking of which,\nit used to be,\nthere was a time,\nwhen all they cared about\nwas eating and screwing.”\n“So don’t let them\nget\ntoo high-minded.\n‘Cause I am here to tell you-\nthat\nby god,\nthey will.\nThey’re all filled up with themselves now,\nbut one day,\nyes one day,\nthey will spill.”\n“Something will tear them all right open\nand some will already know the feeling.\nIt’ll be familiar,\nlike an old, old friend,\nbut now it won’t be borrowing–\nIt will be stealing.\nIt will take all that ever is\nor was\nand what will be\njust won’t be the same.\nIt’ll all be quiet.\nIt will all be quiet.\nAnd in that space there lives a name.”\n.\nI was confused,\nbut it made me think\nof those\nI’d known\nin yesteryears.\nI thought of the times when we called\nwhere we lived\nUnderground .\nI thought of music.\nRemembered tears.\nThe gone and buried.\nThe done and had it.\nThe ones who forged their own brass ring,\nbut then\nthey never got to grab it.\nThe ones who just fell off their horse.\nBut then-\nthey didn’t die.\nI’ve always wondered at what dreams tomorrow- \nbut today, \nI sit \nand cry. \n.\nThe World interrupted,\n“Oh, wait!\nI see it now.\nI see it now,\nit’s plain as day.\nY’all prefer to see through filters.\nYou think that’s how best to make your way.\nNow to be fair,\nthe Sun is bright.\nBut then,\nthat’s why I gave you Night.\nBut you won’t let yourselves collapse.\nYou hold it in so you can fight.\nLook.\nYou won’t get closer\nunless you lean.\nYes plant your feet,\nbut watch where you stand.\nWho do you think\nthat you are\nthere,\nnow breathing?\nLet’s have a laugh\nand make a plan.\nI’m only here,\nyou’re only there–\nJust make a move and use your hands.”\n.\nNow\nI listened to the World,\nremembering\nthose here before us.\nAnd,\nyes,\nI nodded-\nYes, now I get it:\nBecause they sang,\nwe know the chorus.\nThe World nodded yes,\nAnd said,\n“Yes!\nEven though\nThey didn’t make it,\nthey made it.\nYes,\nthey’re gone now.\nAnd yes,\nthat’s it for them\nfrom here on out.\nIt pains me to say it,\nbut that’s how we play it.\nThat’s just the way that I go round.”\n.\nThen for some reason\nI grew quiet\nin the smallest of places.\nAnd watched Time trace its fingers\nacross all the faces.\nI watched as it felt every wrinkle\nand marked every crease.\nAnd took them all to a place\nthat’s known only as\nPeace.\n.\nAnd then the World\njust mumbled softly to itself\nand even chuckled,\n“If you only knew\nthe things that I know-\nYou’d come undone.\nYou’d be unbuckled.\n’Cause the way\nthey put what they do \nabove how they are –\nIt blows my mind.\nAt least,\nit would if I had one.\nAnd frankly, I don’t know what to do.\nI don’t need your\nor your-\nor your-\nor your-\nI need you!”\n“I mean,\nI’m grateful.\nBelieve me.\nYou made me.\nIt’s crazy.\nYou’re a doer.\nI get it.\nI’m not saying\nbe lazy.\nJust sometimes\njust let\nwhat\nyou\ndo\nbe undone.\nRemember,\nthere’s a Moon.\nOver there,\nis a Sun.”\n.\nAnd then the World wept for a bit\nand stared deeply into space.\n“You keep running around\nand running around\nand think that I’m the crazy place!”\n“I’m the World,\nBut so what?\nThey don’t see me\nuntil they have tangled their strings.\nNot until they have broke down in tears.\nApparently, I’m not real enough.\nI’m not a thing\nto them.\nThey won’t even touch me.\nI’m just an idea.”\n“Look-\nYou’re all you’ve got.\nRight?\nBut at least,\npraise creation-\nI’ve got you.\nBut you’re no good to me\nlike that. \nJust take a moment.\nRelax .\nIt’s not the What or the Why,\nit’s the Who.”\n“Take all the moments,\nbelieve me,\nI don’t mind-\nI’ve got plenty.\nI got ’em all, really,\nif we’re being honest.\nBut look-\nI’m getting tired of having to break this to you gently-”\nThen the World held its breath.\nAnd then it let it go.\nIt looked me straight into the eye-\n“Look.\nThis\nis\nall\nthat\nI\nneed\ny’all\nto\nknow:”\n“Take care of yourself,”\nsaid the World.\n“Take care of yourself.“\n“Take my love,\nAnd remember:\nBe true.\nBut take care of yourself.\nThen\ntake care of yourselves .\n’Cause that’s the one thing I can’t do for you.”\nThe Not Yet Burning Country \nby Lee Mokobe “What inspired my poem was having watched my own country, South Africa, and how it chose to deal with xenophobia, homophobia and transphobia. I wanted to speak from my perspective as a trans immigrant and how I see America, the good and the bad. I wanted a poem that was as intense yet challenged people to fight for what they believe in and to take part in protecting people like me and other loved ones. I wanted to protect the America I believed in and still believe in.” — Lee Mokobe \nI have seen a burning country before\nThe kind that just crumbles\nAnd asks of its citizens to call the ruin victory\nWhere immigrants watched their families become cinder\nThe ash making dark clouds of the sky\nAnd the people called it night and not death\nAnd the immigrants wondered why they had enlisted into such a quiet war\nThe kind that did not announce itself but\nErased everything in its wake\nTo make room for “greatness”\n(See: patriotism, see: xenophobia, see: go back to where you came from)\nI have seen a country\nBreak itself apart to make\nFaggots of queer bones\nAnd swore they saw God in the mirage of flames\nThey called it divine faith\nElected themselves deputy jesus’s\nAnd scorched all that which did not look like them\n(See: trannies, See: fags, See: I respect gays just not in front of the children)\nI know of a country\nThat cremates the laws in order to uphold\nThe stale tradition of exclusion and bigotry\nAnd calls that progress America,\nYou are not yet burning\nBut there is plenty of smoke\nAnd people arguing whether it is fair to say this smoke kills\nOr debating whether those who are already choking are being dramatic or truthful\nAnd the media laughs about the matchstick of a leader\nWho sparked the flames\nAnd tells the people to give the fire a chance\nSay that it will not be an act of arson\nBut an act of washing this land anew\nCall it a baptismal worthy of erasing\nEverything this country has learned to hold most dear\nI cannot witness this\nAnd believe that this earth\nDoes not remember hospitality\nAnd how Native Americans\nHad looked at the faces of visitors\nBefore and chosen to call them kin\nTo bathe them, fed them\nAnd let them call this home\nAnd in light of that genesis I have found a family here\nThat lets me call my body mine\nAnd my name glorious\nThat taught me philadelphia summers\nPunctuated by the aroma of halal trucks\nAnd african aunties braiding black girl hair at the speed of light\nAnd a rainbow of melanated children\nDrenched in the joy of fire hydrant showers\nAll this to say\nWe the people, by boat, plane, barbed wire, social security, visa\nBelong here.\nIt is our home.\nWe the people, will continue to fight injustice\nNo matter what it decides to call itself this time\nWe the people will be meeting this blaze of hatred\nWith force and not love\nWe will use our voices as fire extinguishers\nUse physical intervention as water that calms the inferno of violence\nAnd our commitment to inclusion as the sand dunes that engulfed\nThe embers of trumpery\nWe the people, will remind\nAmerica of her true nature.\nA home that greets all of its visitors\nWith a love that sticks\nLong after we are gone\nPeony \nby Robin Morgan https://tedideas.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/morgan-_peony.mp3 \n“This poem, written quite a while ago, arrived like a gift to me when I learned the horticultural truth about how peonies come to bloom. What a metaphor! The poem seems to come back at me again and again: humble, disarmingly simple, and useful in reminding us that bringing anything to life demands patience, collaboration and an individual, steely resolve willed by those who were never, ever expected — sometimes, even by themselves — to succeed. For me, in these dark, political days shadowing our republic, it is a reminder and prediction of the work we have to do, and also of our capacity to do it.” — Robin Morgan \nWhat appears to be\nthis frozen explosion of petals\nabristle with extremist beauty\nlike an entire bouquet on a single stem\nor a full chorus creamy-robed rippling\nto its feet for the sanctus — \nis after all a flower,\nperishable, with a peculiar\nhistory. Each peony\nblossoms only after\nthe waxy casing thick around\nits tight green bud is eaten literally\naway by certain small herbivorous ants\nwho swarm round the stubborn rind\nand nibble gently for weeks to release\nthe implosion called a flower. If\nthe tiny coral-colored ants have been\ndestroyed, the bloom cannot unfist itself\nno matter how carefully forced to umbrage\nby the finest hothouse gardeners. \nUnrecognized, how recognizable. \nEach of us nibbling discreetly\nto release the flower,\nusually not even knowing\nthe purpose, only the hunger; \neach mostly unaware of any others,\nsometimes surprised by a neighbor,\nsometimes (so rarely) astonished\nby a glimpse into one corner\nat how many of us there are; \nenough to cling at least, swarm back,\nremain, whenever we’re shaken\noff or drenched away\nby the well-meaning gardener, ignorant\nas we are of our mission, of our being\nequal in and to the task. \nUnequal to the task: a word\nlike “revolution,” to describe\nwhat our drudge-cheerful midwifery\nwill bring to bear—with us not here\nto see it, satiated, long since\nrinsed away, the job complete. \nWhy then do I feel this tremble,\nmore like a contraction’s aftermath\nrelease, relax, relief\nthan like an earthquake; more\nlike a rustling in the belly,\nor the resonance a song might make\nen route from brain to larynx\nas if now, here, unleaving itself of all\nold and unnecessary outer layers \nbutterfly from chrysalis\nsnake from cast skin\ncrustacean from shell\nbaby from placenta \nsomething alive before\nonly in Anywoman’s dreamings\nbegins to stretch, arch, unfold\neach vein on each transparency opening proud,\nunique, unduplicate,\neach petal stiff with tenderness,\neach gauzy wing a different shading flecked\nivory silver tangerine moon cinnamon amber flame\nhosannas of lucidity and love in a wild riot,\na confusion of boisterous order\nall fragrance, laughter, tousled celebration —\nonly a fading streak like blood\nat the center, to remind us we were there once \nbut are still here, who dare,\ntenacious, to nibble toward such blossoming\nof this green stubborn bud\nsome call a world.\n\nReprinted with permission from the author.
