Gerrard has spoken ahead of Tuesday night's clash (Photo: BT Sport) Gerrard watches on as Demba Ba scores at Anfield (Photo: Kent Gavin/Daily Mirror) \n\"For me, being a Liverpool player and a Liverpool fan, to get any kind of success at some stage we had to knock Chelsea out. \n\"They were the most powerful team, but became the most powerful team and club financial wise but also the player influx. For us to get any kind of success we knew we had to get the better of them. \n\"It’s almost like hatred for 90 minutes. The feeling you get in your body is weird but as soon as the final whistle you need to go back straight away to being respectful. \n\"Obviously it’s a lot more difficult when on the losing end.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:47:09.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
