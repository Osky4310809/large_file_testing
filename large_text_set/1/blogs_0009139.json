The brand’s free voice calls and data offers till March 31st forced rival telcos to reduce their call and data rates. The cut-throat competition has reportedly called a halt to Vodafone India’s planned stock market floatation. The brand is reportedly now seeking a merger with one of the other telecom operators in the country. \nVodafone India, the country’s second largest telecom operator in terms of subscribers, is planning to merge with either Reliance Jio or Idea Cellular, reports The Telegraph . The report says that Vodafone has been caught in the crossfire of the price wars. While Vodafone saw improvement in its European markets, the situation in India isn’t as rosy. \nVodafone is now looking at the possibility of a tie-up with either Reliance Jio, Idea or the other top four providers. Earlier reports have suggested that Reliance Jio and Idea Cellular could themselves combine as well. Vodafone hasn’t made any announcements confirming or denying the report yet, so we’ll have to wait and watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T14:51:59.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
