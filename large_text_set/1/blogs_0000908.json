Before midnight on Saturday, vandals daubed anti-Muslim graffiti on a Superkebab shop in the city of Lublin, which is owned by Indian citizens.

Threatened us and pissed on the wall of the premises. Now it has gone much worse. Two men aged 18-19 and 24-25 years came on the New Year‚Äôs Eve and demolished our premises. Both had hoods on their heads. Fortunately, all of the events was recorded on surveillance , the matter is reported to the police,‚Äù the owner of the diner, Shullye Parvez, told Polska Times. \nPolice have opened an investigation into the incident.
