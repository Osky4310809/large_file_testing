One of the last remaining Shakers dies at 89, leaving just 2 https://t.co/Ps8zb8lss6 pic.twitter.com/xSGAwyJhK6 \n— Boston.com (@BostonDotCom) January 3, 2017 \nCarr, 89, died due to cancer Monday at the Shaker community of Sabbathday Lake in New Gloucester, Maine, surrounded by friends and her nieces. Before she died, Carr said she was hopeful more people would join the Shakers; remaining member Brother Arnold Hadd, 60, said some people have come to Sabbathday Lake in recent years, but they decided not to stay. \"Every day the prayers go up that we will get people to come, that we get competent vocations,\" he told The Associated Press . \"It's a calling from God.\" \nMembers of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming fled persecution in England, settling in upstate New York in 1747 (critics dubbed them the \"Shaking Quakers\" because of the way they worshiped at the time). They believe in pacifism, communal ownership, celibacy, and gender equality, and are credited with creating the flat-bottom broom and circular saw. Before the Civil War, there were more than 5,000 followers in 18 communities across 10 states, but the numbers gradually dwindled due to the celibacy of members and the decision to stop accepting orphans into the fold. Now, the only Shaker community is Sabbathday Lake, home to Hadd and 78-year-old Sister June Carpenter.

Manigault has worked in Washington before — she served in the office of Vice President Al Gore — but in recent years, she's become famous for her stints on the first season of The Apprentice (during which she was labeled a villain), its sequels The Celebrity Apprentice (where she feuded with Piers Morgan) and The Celebrity Apprentice: All Stars (this time she threatened to sue a \"demented\" La Toya Jackson), and The Surreal Life, Fear Factor , and Girls Behaving Badly . \nA transition official told ABC News Manigault actually wanted to be the ambassador to Haiti, as she has done missionary work in the country. Trump fired her in week nine of The Apprentice , week 10 of The Celebrity Apprentice , and week five of The Celebrity Apprentice: All Stars , so best wishes to Manigault this time around.
