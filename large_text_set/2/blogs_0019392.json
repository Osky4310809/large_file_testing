We are aware that the soldiers are working for them, the PDP members in this ward are not happy. \nHowever, an APC supporter, Elizander Amadi told The Nation that it was PDP thugs that stormed the three units in the area and carted away the ballot boxes. \nHe said: “When PDP members discovered that we were winning, they instructed bad boys in the area who are loyal to their party to disrupt the peaceful process. But we thank God that the military later discovered the ballot boxes and other electoral materials at the bush.” \nThe elections could not be concluded during the December 10 third rerun election as a result of similar violence. \nReports from different parts of the area said despite earlier pledges by stakeholders to allow peace reign yesterday, snatching of electoral material including ballot papers, ballot boxes and smart card readers became the order of the day. \nElection materials for Polling units 9 and 10 in ward 14 were snatched from electoral officers on their way to the unit, while the Supervisor for the Ward 14, simply identified as Jones was beaten to stupor. \nHe was later rescued by sympathizers. \nThe police, in most cases, chose to ignore cries for help apparently to avoid accusations from politicians. \nAn INEC Information Communication Technology officer from Abuja was reportedly attacked at Ward 5 Igbo-Etche by political thugs believed to be working for one of the political parties in. His offence was trying to fix the Smart Card Reader deployed to the unit for the accreditation of voters. \nSome people were not comfortable with the use of the Smart Card Readers and came all out to make them un-useable. \nThe Acting State Commissioner of Police (CP), Ahmed Magaji who was at the scene of arrest said, “investigations are ongoing on the 52 suspected political thugs arrested at Etche. Full report would be released after investigation.” \nThe INEC National commissioner for Rivers, Edo and Bayelsa states, Mrs. May Agbamuche-Mbu said the commission would not take the arrests lightly. \nHe said: “early this (yesterday) morning, INEC staff had started mobilizing themselves to the polling units, but unfortunately this happened again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:54:02.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
