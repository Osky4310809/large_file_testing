Wijnaldum says Liverpool are back on track Wijnaldum's equaliser earned Liverpool a point against Chelsea (Photo: REUTERS) \nGeorginio Wijnaldum believes Liverpool have sent “an important message” to their Champions’ League rivals... but must now back it up with top-four level consistency, writes Mirror Football's David Maddock. \nMidfielder Wijnaldum believes it shows his team are back to their intense best, and now he wants his team-mates to back it up by addressing their biggest weakness this season – against the less fancied teams. \n“Of course it was an important message,\" the Dutchman said. “But it is more important that we continue it. View gallery \n\"We showed it against Manchester City (who they beat on New Year's Eve at Anfield) and in the next game (the 2-2 draw at relegation candidates Sunderland), we didn’t. It is important to carry on the way we did (against Chelsea) and get a few points, otherwise it was for nothing. \n“We played with aggression and passion and that is a good thing to go forward but we must ensure we do it in every game. That’s the most important thing. If you do it one game and then not the next, it will cost you points. We saw in January that if you are not sharp, if you don’t play how we used to play, it will cost us points.” Carragher doubts Liverpool's title credentials Carragher (right) is still unsure Liverpool can go all the way (Photo: Action Images via Reuters / Ed Sykes) \nLiverpool legend Jamie Carragher does not believe Chelsea will be caught in the race for the Premier League title, writes Sam Batson for Mirror Football. \nThe Champions League winner was impressed with his former side's performance in the 1-1 draw against Antonio Conte's side on Tuesday night. \nBut after a recent poor run of form from Jurgen Klopp 's men, Carragher believes Liverpool are merely chasing a top-four spot.
