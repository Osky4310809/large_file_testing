Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters   Rowena Mason Deputy political editor   17.00   17.02 GMT \nTheresa May has warned MPs not to obstruct the Brexit bill during its second phase of parliamentary debate, after the House of Commons voted overwhelmingly for the legislation last week. \nThe prime minister said MPs must not use parliamentary procedures to delay the passage of the bill, which will be debated over the next three days. \nDozens of amendments have been tabled by opposition MPs in the hope of getting enough cross-party support to secure better parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit, the rights of EU nationals living in the UK, access to the single market and a more meaningful vote at the end of the two-year negotiations. \nMay appears to be standing firm on these issues, although No 10 could have to make concessions if enough Tory backbenchers look set to rebel. \n“Our European partners now want to get on with the negotiations, so do I, and so does this House, which last week voted by a majority of 384 in support of the government triggering article 50,” she said. \n“There are of course further stages for the bill in committee and in the Lords and it is right that this process should be completed properly.
