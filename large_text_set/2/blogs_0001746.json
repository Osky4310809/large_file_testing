More than 46,000 budding photographers entered the global competition which saw 12-year-old Kate Anderson from Shelley, Idaho, capturing the grand prize. Her photo of an ostrich chick, chirping away in front of a miniature microphone, titled 'Owning the Stage,' saw Kate win a ten-day trip to the Galápagos Islands. Kate's photo and the U.S. category winners, along with the worldwide grand-prize winner, will be featured in the May 2017 U.S. edition of National Geographic Kids magazine, reaching approximately four million U.S. readers. Owning the stage: Kate Anderson, 12, took a photo with her new ostrich chick. The picture led her to win the U.S. competition Dewi Baggerman, 11, from The Netherlands, won the global side of the competition with his picture of the underside of tulips Underwater basketball: Josephine Goldman, 13, wrote: 'I went to a summer camp in North Carolina where I got scuba certified. In one lake I went diving in, Fantasy Lake, there were many everyday things under the water, such as a basketball court complete with 14-pound bowling balls that felt like basketballs while underwater. I captured this shot right as my friend dunked the ball into the basket as the sun blazed down into the water' Dromedaries on Diani: Piers Nicklin, 12, said: 'Napping on the beach, I opened my eyes to this colorful parade of camels on Galu Beach in Kenya' In the global field, 11-year-old Dewi Baggerman from the Netherlands won a five-day trip to Washington, D.C. for his picture of a field of vibrant tulips shot from a unique angle. Open to children ages six to 14, the worldwide competition was conducted in partnership with the U.S. edition of National Geographic Kids magazine and nine other local-language editions: Bulgaria, China, Egypt, Germany, India, Indonesia, Netherlands, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Each country then held a national contest and, in the final round, sent one photo from each of the four categories to National Geographic headquarters for judging.
