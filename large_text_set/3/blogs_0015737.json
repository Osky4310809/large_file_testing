running About 650 million people, or 10% of the world's population, do not have access to safe water, putting them at risk of infectious diseases and premature death. By David Sim March 20, 2017 12:43 GMT \nWorld Water Day is marked 22 March every year to raise awareness of the water crisis facing much of the world's population. The UN estimates that more than 663 million people do not have a safe water supply close to home. Instead of turning on a tap, they must spend countless hours queueing or trekking to sources of water. This water is often contaminated, putting people at risk of infectious diseases and premature death. People gather to fetch water from a huge well in the village of Natwarghad in the western Indian state of Gujarat Reuters \nDirty water and poor sanitation can cause severe diseases in children, killing 900 under-fives every day across the world, according to United Nations estimates – or one child every two minutes. Among newborn babies, the World Health Organisation says infections caused by a lack of safe water and an unclean environment cause one death every minute somewhere in the world. \nThe theme of World Water 2017 is \"Why waste water?\" The vast majority of wastewater from homes, cities, industry and agriculture around the world flows back to nature without being treated or reused – polluting the environment, and losing valuable nutrients and other recoverable materials. WWD2017 aims to promote the need for reducing and reusing wastewater for things like irrigation and cooling. \nTo mark World Water Day 2017, IBTimes UK presents 60 powerful photos to remind us that one in ten people don't have access to clean, safe water.

One of the ideas behind having a special day is to make people think twice about how much water they waste. People who have plentiful access to water are encouraged to try not turning on their taps all day. Water is a finite resource that is fundamental to human well-being. Don't waste it.
