Such demeaning “security” practices represent just one of many unacceptable privacy invasions we’ve allowed to happen to us as a people since being overwhelmed by irrational fears of terrorism following the attacks of 9/11. Such fears are never allowed to dissipate since they’re constantly reinforced and encouraged by corporate media, hack politicians and the military-industrial-intelligence complex looking to make money from imprisoning Americans in an all-encompassing surveillance grid panopticon where we cheer on our own enslavement. \nToday’s story brings a very important yet unresolved issue back to the forefront of public discussion, where it must remain until this practice is done away with forever. A furious mom has blasted the TSA officers who she says gave her disabled son an ‘unnecessary’ and ‘horrifying’ pat-down in a Dallas airport on Sunday. Jennifer Williamson says that her son Aaron, who has sensory processing disorder, was detained for more than an hour at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport despite not setting off the metal detector. And although she asked the TSA agent not to perform a pat-down, saying it would upset the boy, the agent went through with it anyway. Williamson then recorded the ‘traumatizing’ incident in a video that has now been seen more than 1.5 million times. It’s now up to 5.4 million views. Sometimes the agent appears to pat the boy on areas that he has already checked. In a Facebook post, Williamson said that she and Aaron were punished and made to wait ‘well over an hour’ because she asked the TSA agents to respect Aaron’s condition. ‘We were treated like dogs because I requested they attempt to screen him in other ways per TSA rules,’ she said. Now watch the video. Yeah, it’s disgusting, inappropriate and anathema to a free people, but that’s the point. We aren’t a free people. We’ve become a bunch of authority-worshiping subjects toiling on a plantation dominated by multi-national companies who write our laws and manipulate our thoughts through corporate media. The worst part is we don’t do anything about it. We elect Trump and then puff our chests out yelling stupid slogans like MAGA, as molestations from the TSA get worse. Well done everyone. More invasive TSA searches? What exactly am I talking about? Perhaps you missed the recent Bloomberg article, U.S. Airport Pat-Downs Are About to Get More Invasive : \nWhile few have noticed, U.S. airport security workers long had the option of using five different types of physical pat-downs at the screening line. Now those options have been eliminated and replaced with a single universal approach. This time, you will notice. \n\nThe new physical touching—for those selected to have a pat-down—will be be what the federal agency officially describes as a more “comprehensive” physical screening, according to a Transportation Security Administration spokesman. \n\nDenver International Airport, for example, notified employees and flight crews on Thursday that the “more rigorous” searches “will be more thorough and may involve an officer making more intimate contact than before.” \n\n“I would say people who in the past would have gotten a pat-down that wasn’t involved will notice that the [new] pat-down is more involved,” TSA spokesman Bruce Anderson said Friday. The shift from the previous, risk-based assessment on which pat-down procedure an officer should apply was phased in over the past two weeks after tests at smaller airports, he said. This from an agency that couldn’t find a bomb if it was placed in its hands. Don’t believe me? Perhaps you missed the following: Big Brother Idiocy – TSA Spent $160 Million on Naked Body Scanners that Fail 96% of the Time Just great. Unfortunately, the move to more invasive pat downs is merely one aspect of a move to even more idiotic security theater when it comes to air travel. Like the banning of electronics larger than a phone on flights from certain airpots, which a former Israeli airport security boss basically called total idiocy . Finally, while we know the TSA isn’t good at catching terrorists, we do know its agents are very good at theft and sexual perversion. How do we know this?
