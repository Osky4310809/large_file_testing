Penney said it expects to close two distribution facilities and 130 to 140 of its 1,000-plus stores throughout the year. \nAmerican Apparel has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection twice since October 2015. In 2016, Macy's announced it would close close 100 of its 728 stores , explaining that the properties would be worth more as real estate. Sports Authority went bankrupt and decided to shut down all 450 of its locations. \nMany others have failed to meet even their bleakest expectations. Photos of abandoned, dilapidated malls filled with plant overgrowth make the rounds online frequently as more closures loom. \nMeanwhile, online-first companies are opening brick-and-mortar storefronts, and 71 percent of people say they would prefer to purchase an item in a store if one was located nearby. Ecommerce is no replacement for touching and feeling a product before making a purchase -- 85 percent of people value this option, according to TimeTrade . Many people prefer to shop in stores, but stores aren’t doing enough to meet their demands and rival the online experience. \n“There is no shiny object or silver bullet to this retailer set of challenges out there,” says Pano Anthos, managing director of retail innovation accelerator XRC Labs . In order to stay relevant to smartphone-consumed consumers, stores have to get creative and bring the digital world to the physical world. \nHere are five ideas retailers are testing that would make us actually enthusiastic about going shopping again: 1 / 5 Susan Chiang | Getty Images 1. In-store experiences \nWhen was the last time a big sale made you get in your car and head to the local mall? (Black Friday 2012?) What about the last time an email alert from a store (“free shipping!”) inspired you to make an impulse buy? (Last week?) \nThanks to the convenience of ecommerce, you don’t have to get off your couch to outfit your entire wardrobe or home. That means stores have to offer an experience that will outdo even the flashiest online deal. \nAt its flagship store in Manhattan, Macy’s has recently hosted dance parties as well as opened a special floor, called One Below, geared toward millennials. One Below contains selfie walls, wearable tech and 3-D printers for custom-made accessories. Members of the young demographic value being able to curate and personalize their possessions, sure, but they also don’t like being stereotyped. They’re turned off by transparent attempts to market to them, and they don’t all dwell on their obsession with selfies like older generations do. Still, these efforts are a sign that Macy’s recognizes the need to offer something more than merchandise alone. \nMany stores have offered alternatives such as special events and classes over the years, but today the stakes are higher. “People don’t hang out, because the stores are boring,” Anthos says. “Store engagement gives the consumer a reason to be there beyond simply buying an object.” \nIn December, Nordstrom contributed to a $15.5 million series B financing round for Shoes of Prey, a company that lets people customize a pair of heels or flats. Shoes of Prey started as online-only, but it quickly realized the demand for people to try on shoes before shelling out. Now, Shoes of Prey operates out of many Nordstrom stores -- a win for both companies. \nThe problem is, most major retailers are still in the experimental phase. They haven’t done much research to find out if events actually make people want to spend more, for instance. Besides, adding a 3-D printer to a store in New York is one thing, but it’s a huge expense to install them chain-wide, leaving shoppers in the Midwest without more reasons to stop in. \nWhat the companies do know is that many customers expect VIP service. Eighty-nine percent of consumers want shopping to feel personalized, but only 18 percent of them say that retailers are achieving this level of service, according to mobile marketing platform Vibes . A positive interaction with a sales associate can go a long way. But anyone who’s been accosted immediately upon walking into a store knows how annoying that can be. \n“It’s very similar to the digital journey in ecommerce,” Anthos says. “You’re looking, thinking, learning, reading way before you’re ready to buy something. Attentiveness and clerks are a very late stage in the purchase process.” \nAnother example is the movement among stores of asking your name, writing it on a dry erase board on a dressing room door and playing the roles of BFF and personal shopper. But how is that employee supposed to know that just because you’re trying on clothes in a store that sells pink ponchos, that doesn’t mean you would ever wear one? \nTimeTrade found that 59 percent of millennials say they would spend more if a personal shopper proposed suggestions. The distinction is that not every sales associate is trained to be a personal shopper, and not every customer believes they have signed an invisible contract to receive style tips. The stores that really want to connect with you are doing more than exchanging shallow small talk. Rather than bombard customers to find out their preferences and persuade them to buy something, more and more retailers are trying to figure out how to get you to open up about how you shop online. 2 / 5 Akiko Aoki | Getty Images 2. Omnichannel retail \nWhile “omnichannel” might sound like an industry buzzword, it’s the future of shopping. Even today, if you’re shopping in a store, chances are you’ve done a bit of research online beforehand. \nAt the most basic level, omnichannel retail refers to a consistent shopping experience online and off. But that doesn’t just mean the store and website sell the same merch. It also refers to bait stores cast out to reel you in. \nAccording to Google’s marketing insights arm, Think With Google , retailers want to know how you shop when you’re not in their stores. On your laptop? On your phone? If you made the trek to a store, what prompted you to go? Was it an ad? Was that ad on another website? A promoted Facebook post? An email promotion? \nIf you’re a shopper getting wind of these tactics, you might feel like stores are spying on you. But they’re doing it all with your interests -- quite literally -- in mind. \nGoogle cites a 2015 IDC study that found omnichannel shoppers have a 30 percent higher lifetime value for retailers than their single-channel counterparts. Stores are desperate to master the art of not only getting your attention, but also making sure that when they do, that you can transfer your online browsing into in-store buying with no hiccups. Think: the end of online-only deals. \nSay you’re browsing a store’s website and add a few items in your virtual shopping cart, but you don’t check out. Instead, you travel to the store to see them for yourself. If you sign in when you arrive, maybe by sharing your email address with a tablet-toting employee (à la Apple Store Genius Bar), it’ll make finding and buying those products much easier. Plus, that sales associate will get a sense of your tastes and preferences and be better equipped to provide you personalized service. \nThis practice falls more in line with hiring a personal shopper. However, there’s a catch-22. Anthos explains: “You want my user information to give me better service, but I want better service before I give you that user information.” \nTimeTrade surveyed nearly 5,500 consumers and found that 59 percent would be willing to share their online shopping carts with in-store employees. The idea is even more favorable among millennial and gen Z consumers, at about two-thirds. Retailers have been slow to catch on: 24 percent of them have this capability today, while 26 percent say they aren’t interested in implementing it. They’re still afraid it won’t be a hit. \n“Stores are proud of their heritage,” Anthos says. “Their whole model is, ‘we’ve been around for 150, 200 years.’ But that heritage means they don’t change very much, very fast, and when they put something in, if it doesn’t succeed right away, it’s considered a failure. … Startup companies think of failure as a learning experience. That never crosses the mind or the culture of a retailer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:18:02.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
