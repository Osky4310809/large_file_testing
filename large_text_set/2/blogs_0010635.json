Now we’re diving deeper by highlighting a closer look at the space, courtesy of A$AP Bari himself, as well as what went down during the much-hyped NYFW event.\nAs expected, the pop-up event was a who’s who in attendance, with appearances from the likes of PlayBoi Carti, Jerry Lorenzo, Shaun Ross, Paloma Elsesser, Winnie Harlow, Big Sean, Adrienne Ho, Aluna George, Anna Trevelyan, Brenmar, Aleali May, and more. A$AP Ferg was also on-hand for A$AP Bari’s soiree, as he let loose of a performance, while Virgil Abloh in turn provided some additional fire tunes while DJing.\nFor a look at what all went down, see the on-hand imagery below, and for a tour of the space courtesy of Bari himself, press play on the video above.\nSubscribe to Highsnobiety’s sneaker chatbot on Facebook to receive lightning quick updates on release dates, sneaker street style, shopping tips and more. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:59:59.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
