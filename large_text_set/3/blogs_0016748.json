Pressed flower nails are our new obsession. Fresh flowers and nail art, what's not to love?\nImage Source: 20th Century Fox\nIn the words of Miranda Priestly of The Devil Wears Prada , these Spring floral might just be \"groundbreaking.\" The trend uses tiny wild flowers, dried and pressed to create the most dainty accessories. A gel base and top coat will ensure the flowers are fully sealed in and won't lift off the nail. Whether all nails end up covered with the tiny petals, or only few petite flowers and gold flakes give minimalist finish, this look is blooming beautiful!\nThe best part is that you can do it at home. Get out on a Spring walk, and scout out your own tiny flowers to re-create this adorable art. Press them between the pages of a heavy book until they dry out. If you don't have an at-home gel system be sure to use a good quality top coat twice to seal in the flowers onto your nails.\nRelated:\n21 Seasonal Tattoo Ideas For Anyone Who Really, Truly Loves Spring\nPrevious Next", "external_links": ["https://api.shopstyle.com/action/apiVisitRetailer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fseche-vite-fast-dry-top-coat-14ml%2Fp465676%3Fsku%3D232120098%26s_afcid%3Daf_79682%26tmad%3Dc%26awc%3D1203_1490096593_33efaa524f0eb862c15db84f3faa8fdf%26tmcampid%3D48&pid=popsugar&pdata=18348394", "https://www.popsugar.co.uk/beauty/Intricate-Dotticure-Nail-Art-Designs-43280367", "http://www.fox.co.uk/"], "published": "2017-03-21T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:34:34.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
