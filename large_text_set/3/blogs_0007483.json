But this defeat, which secured a 10-2 aggregate victory for Bayern in the Champions League round of 16, carried the air of a pivotal moment in Arsenal's history. \nAfter so many annual disappointments -- this is the seventh consecutive season in which Arsenal have been knocked out at the last-16 stage -- the fans have had enough. \nWenger is the target of many of them, who regard the manager as having past his sell-by date after almost 21 years in charge. But Kroenke is also beginning to feel the heat from those supporters who pay to sit in the most expensive seats in English football. \nThey pay fortunes to watch Arsenal, but all they hear from Kroenke's executives is how much money the club has in its cash reserves. They want to hear of Arsenal out-bidding Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United for star signings, or giving the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil the kind of contracts that would prevent them from thinking of moves elsewhere. And they also want Kroenke and chief executive Ivan Gazidis to show some leadership by not allowing Wenger and his players to settle simply for Champions League qualification while their rivals are winning trophies. \nMany fans have turned on Wenger because they have become exasperated by what they perceive to be his stubbornness and refusal to move with the times in the transfer market. But there remains a loyalty towards Wenger, even an affection, because of the glory and joy he brought to the club during his first decade in charge: the great double-winning teams of Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, Tony Adams and Dennis Bergkamp and the Invincibles of Thierry Henry, Sol Campbell and Robert Pires. On and off the pitch, these are turbulent times at the Emirates. It is difficult to see how Arsene Wenger can deliver this season. \nWenger has etched his name in Arsenal's history and it will never be erased, but Kroenke has done nothing to earn the respect and adoration of the fans and that is why he is now finding himself in the eye of the storm. \nKroenke, nicknamed \"Silent Stan,\" is a difficult man to read because he says so little and rarely gives any indication as to what he is thinking in terms of the club's future. But he is the one who holds Arsenal's destiny in his hands. \nWenger may want to decide when he goes and the manner of his departure, but only Kroenke can grant him that wish. If he takes time to consider the footballing decline at the Emirates rather than the upwards trajectory of the club's finances, he may well choose to display the ruthlessness of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich or his fellow American owners at Liverpool and Manchester United by changing the manager after failure on the pitch. \nBut there is little sign of him doing so and the supporters are turning against him because they see a man who cares only for the bottom line rather than the silverware in the trophy cabinet. The fans want glory, but Kroenke seemingly only thinks in terms of growth in a financial sense. The end result is drift and the comfort zone that Wenger and his players have fallen into. Not that it is proving too comfortable right now, with humiliation suffered twice in the space of three weeks against Bayern. \nOn and off the pitch, these are turbulent times at the Emirates and it is difficult to see how Wenger can salvage something from this season. Out of the Champions League and facing a battle to qualify again via the Premier League, even a 13th FA Cup triumph would feel like a hollow one at the end of a campaign that promised so much. \nWenger spoke of the \"unexplainable and scandalous\" decisions that cost his team against Bayern, but that was an attempt at smoke and mirrors, to shift eyes from the real problems at the club. \nBut he summed up why the supporters have had enough, and why many of them have placed him alongside Kroenke as the root of the problems, when asked what must change at Arsenal during his post-match news conference. \n\"What must change?\" Wenger replied. \"This club is in a great shape, it is just going through a difficult situation.\" \nSorry, Arsene, but Arsenal were in great shape when they were winning major trophies and reaching Champions League finals. \nAnd those days seem a long, long time ago. \nMark Ogden is a senior football writer for ESPN FC.
