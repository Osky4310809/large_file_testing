Striker. #S04BMG — OptaFranz (@OptaFranz) March 9, 2017 \nYet Schalke – without a win in their last five outings and perilously close to the relegation places in the Bundesliga standings – responded in kind, as Leon Goretzka's well-weighted pass in behind an exposed Gladbach defence set up the opportunity for Burgstaller to equalise. \nThe forward's early shot from the right was perfectly placed to find the far corner of the net, although the visitors felt the goal shouldn't have stood due to an apparent foul on Raffael that had allowed Schalke to steal possession and trigger a successful counter attack. 1 – All 4 goals from Burgstaller for @s04_en were the 1st goal for his team in their matches. Opening. #S04BMG — OptaFranz (@OptaFranz) March 9, 2017 \nHofmann was denied a second before the break by Fahrmann's close-range block, while Yann Sommer had to be alert at the other end to turn aside a dipping free-kick from Johannes Geis. \nChances were scarce after the half-time interval as Gladbach were happy to cede possession and play on the counter, although Benedikt Hoewedes failed to find the target with a free header from a corner on the hour mark. \nA mix-up between Schalke duo Thilo Kehrer and Fahrmann should have gifted a goal to Fabian Johnson, yet the United States international failed to capitalise as a heavy touch denied him the opportunity to tap into an unguarded net. \nSchalke substitute Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting was denied a goal inside two minutes of coming on by a smart save from Sommer, who reacted quickly to stop a low shot sneaking in at the near post. \nThe Gladbach goalkeeper had to rely on the crossbar to keep out a deflected drive from Burgstaller soon after though, meaning Schalke will have to score in the second leg to progress through to the quarter-finals.
