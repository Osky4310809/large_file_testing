This is all done under Executive Order 12333 [the order which allows unlimited spying no matter what intelligence officials claim] .... \n\nFBI would only ask for a warrant if they wanted to be able to take it into court at some point given they have something meaningful as evidence. This is clearly true given the fact the President Trump's phone conversations with other country leaders were leaked to the mainstream media. \nIn other words, Binney is saying that Trumps phones were bugged by the NSA without a warrant - remember, top NSA whistleblowers have previously explained that the NSA is spying on virtually all of the digital communications of Americans . - and the NSA shared the raw data with the CIA, FBI and other agencies. \nIf the FBI obtained a warrant to tap Trump's phone, it was a \"parallel construction\" to \"launder\" improperly-gained evidence through acceptable channels. \nAs we've previously explained : \nThe government is “laundering” information gained through mass surveillance through other agencies, with an agreement that the agencies will “recreate” the evidence in a “parallel construction” … so they don’t have to admit that the evidence came from unconstitutional spying. This data laundering is getting worse and worse . \nSo does it mean that the NSA spying on Trump Tower actually turned up some dirt? \nMaybe ... \nBut history shows that mass surveillance has long been used to blackmail opponents ... including high-level officials . And see this . \nAnd the former NSA director admitted that the mass surveillance is a power grab. \nSo we won't know until the intelligence agencies actually show their cards ... and reveal what evidence they've gathered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T08:12:51.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
