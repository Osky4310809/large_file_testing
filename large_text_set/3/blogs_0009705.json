Not one. \nGetting that first road win is huge for the Timbers and it just so happens to come in LA, where they last won a regular season away game way back in September 2015. Troy Wayrynen Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports 2 The lone goal was a perfect counterattack \nThe Galaxy had a corner kick, but 17 seconds later the ball was in the back of their own net. That's because the Timbers hit them with the perfect counterattack. It was as quick and clinical as could be, with Sebastian Blanco hitting a long ball that Diego Chara brilliantly headed into the path of Diego Valeri. Then Valeri hit a square ball for a tap in and that was that. Isaiah J. Downing Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports 3 The red card to Jelle van Damme was horrible \nThe Galaxy played more than half the match down a man because of some terrible refereeing by Baldomero Toledo. First, he bought a dive and whistled van Damme for a foul. Whether he carded the Galaxy captain for the foul or dissent is unclear, but the defender was carded. Minutes later, Toledo again bought a dive and showed van Damme a second yellow card. \nvan Damme didn't make contact with the Timbers players on either tackle, but he was sent off all the same. Gary A. Vasquez Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports 4 Bad news for Giovani dos Santos (and maybe Mexico) \nIt wasn't long after kickoff that dos Santos was grabbing and trying to stretch his hamstring. By halftime, he had been substituted off. It's still unclear how severe the injury is, but the Galaxy lean very heavily on dos Santos and the timing couldn't be worse for Mexico, who were almost certainly going to use him for World Cup qualifying in two weeks. \nHopefully it was all precautionary and dos Santos is fine, but hamstrings can be tricky. Gary A. Vasquez Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports 5 The Galaxy's new guys are still adjusting \nThe Galaxy signing Romain Alessandrini as a Designated Player and Joao Pedro to help rebuild their midfield, but through two matches, neither has made a huge impact. Alessandrini got better later in the match, but he still hasn't found his stride and Pedro has been very poor. It's still early and it can take time to adjust to MLS, but the Galaxy are counting on those two being impact players and they haven't gotten that yet. Mark J. Rebilas Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports 6 LA Galaxy or LA Galaxy II? \nThe Galaxy want to lean on their academy, and that means bringing players up from LA Galaxy II, but there was a point in the match when they had more players who played for the reserve team last season than they did first teamers. That probably isn't exactly what the Galaxy hoped for. \nInjuries have really taken a toll on LA and they don't have the proven depth to handle them right now. Gary A. Vasquez Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports 7 Jake Gleeson saved the match for Portland \nThe Galaxy actually played pretty well with 10 men and it looked like Jose Villarreal had equalized in stoppage time, but Gleeson made an absolutely unreal reaction save to preserve the Timbers win.
