Luna gets 'Baby of the year!' Chrissy & family joke the Oscars To   \nChrissy snuck fans a peek of the bloody burn hole lurking under a Band-Aid on her leg. She told Snapchat followers, \nI have a pretty bad burn on my leg, right where my slit is on my dress. \nLuckily, Chrissy’s pals know all the best burn-related survival tricks. \nShe said, \nChristine is using milk of magnesia to… I don’t know, honestly. Do something… No one will ever know. \nNaturally, Chrissy ended up looking like a shimmering angel from glamour heaven. Power couple Chrissy Teigen & John Legend walk carpet for Oscars To   \nOn the red carpet, John Legend stepped back and watched his wife with the kind of look in his eyes most of us reserve for a bagel buffet or any backyard pool with a slide. \nChrissy and John have long been considered everyone’s ultimate #RelationshipGoals, but the Sports Illustrated model recently told People anyone thirsting for a marriage like theirs needs to take a seat from time to time. \nShe said, \nI do think it’s kind of silly.

But also, the things they say it for are so stupid, like, we’ll be eating a burrito and someone will be like, ‘Relationship goals!’ and I’m like, ‘Go get a burrito? Just eat a burrito!’ \nSo true. If single life taught me anything, it’s the power burritos possess to find us in our loneliest moments and remind us life can be lived successfully alone. \nOne day we’ll each find our John (or Chrissy) to eat hot meat tortillas with, but until that day comes, we hoover those precious Mexican bundles solo. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:15:59.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
