Based on your voice commands, they can open apps, play music you like, tell you what the weather is like, and a bunch of other things. It’s no wonder that Samsung , the biggest smartphone manufacturer in the world, wants in on the action.\nWe have already reported that the South Korean giant is developing its own digital assistant called Bixby , that will make its debut on the upcoming Galaxy S8 . We assume that Google isn’t a big fan of Samsung’s plans as it would prefer to see its own AI features on all Android phones. The relationship between the two companies reportedly hasn’t been great lately, as Google allegedly pushes to limit the software customizations and apps that can be installed on smartphones running Android.\nSee also: Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant might have a new home soon in Sonos speakers 4 days ago It looks like Samsung is taking the high road. According to a report from The Investor , the company is prepared to work closely with Google when it comes to AI. One of the company’s representatives said that Samsung and Google will have to maintain their strategic partnership in order to bring the artificial intelligence ecosystem to the next level.\nAdditionally, Samsung mentioned that it would eventually bring its AI features to other devices as well, including tablets and TVs. This means that the upcoming Bixby digital assistant will expand beyond smartphones, which really is great to hear.\nJust yesterday Samsung pointed towards artificial intelligence as a main sales driver in 2017. It’s obvious that the company is serious about integrating AI features in its devices, whether they are powered by Google or developed in house. Prepare to hear a lot more about AI going forward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T15:40:21.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
