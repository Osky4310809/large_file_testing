Temples: Golden Temple \nAmritsar, home to the Golden Temple, was founded in 1577 by Guru Ram Das, the fourth guru of Sikhs. It’s the spiritual capital of the Sikhs and gained its name, meaning \"Holy Pool of Nectar\", from the body of water around the Golden Temple. The exquisite Golden Temple attracts pilgrims from all over the world and the number of visitors it gets rivals that of the Taj Mahal! It looks particularly arresting at night when it’s beautifully lit up, with its imposing gold dome illuminated. City Palace, Udaipur. Sam Segar 4. Regal Splendor: Udaipur \nAh, Udaipur!

South Indian Culture: Madurai \nAncient Madurai in Tamil Nadu is home to the most impressive and important temple in south India -- the Meenakshi Temple . If you only see one south Indian temple, the Meenakshi Temple should be it. The city of Madurai is more than 4,000 years old, and has remained a major center for Tamil culture and learning. The 12 day Chithirai Festival , featuring a re-enacted celestial wedding of God and Goddess, is held in Madurai during April each year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:18.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
