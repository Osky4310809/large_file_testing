(MIKE BLAKE/REUTERS)   7:46 PM \nRory Feek paid a touching tribute to his late wife Joey Feek Sunday after the couple won a Grammy for their final project together. \nHe recalled how their award-winning “Hymns That Are Important To Us” came out just a month before Joey lost her public battle with stage 4 cervical cancer at age 40 last March. \n“We sat together in the final days and watched this awards ceremony last year, and she said, ‘If we get nominated, promise me you will come,’” Feek, 51, shared as he accepted the couple’s trophy during the Grammy’s pre-show. \n“She said, ‘Remember, if we win, I’ll know before you will,’” Feek said, his voice breaking with emotion.

It just became her last.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:14:40.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
