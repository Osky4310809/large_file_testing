Protection. Power. Progress. WOMEN RISE UP. Join us on the 21st at the #WomensMarch on Washington. #WMWArt: @weezyvc / @refinery29 \nA photo posted by Women's March (@womensmarch) on Jan 12, 2017 at 7:58pm PST \nIt started as a Facebook page launched in the hours following Donald Trump’s election in November, and since then, the Women’s March on Washington has grown into a national — even global — movement. It not only challenges the new administration, but rejects the administration’s dangerous and hateful rhetoric that began during the election and has continued into the new year.\nThe event is meant to be a remarkable display of solidarity, both in protest of a divisive president and — as the march’s mission statement describes — for the protection of “our rights, our safety, our health, and our families — recognizing that our vibrant and diverse communities are the strength of our country.” While a major cornerstone of this movement is the protection of women’s rights, the Women’s March, despite its name, is not all about female equality. The wholly inclusive march , which continues to get bigger every day , is a joint effort between dozens of partner advocacy groups and resistance movements , including those fighting for civil rights, LGBTQIA rights, worker’s rights, immigrant rights, and environmental protection.\nIn just a few short days, hundreds of thousands of activists, politicians, celebrities, and everyday people will descend on Washington, D.C. to make their voices unequivocally heard, and I am proud to say I will be one of them.\nA photo posted by Women's March (@womensmarch) on Jan 16, 2017 at 10:09am PST \nHere’s why:\n1. To show solidarity for all women. \n\"Each time a woman stands up for herself, without knowing it possibly, without claiming it, she stands up for all women.\" -Maya Angelou #WomensMarch #WhyIMarch #January21 #WMWArt: @bonbonoiseau \nA photo posted by Women's March (@womensmarch) on Jan 11, 2017 at 10:38pm PST \nThe Women’s March on Washington has opened up a contentious but vital conversation about race and feminism — one that, as a white, middle class woman, makes me feel guilty, uncomfortable, and ashamed. November’s election results sent shockwaves through our country, and white women like me cried out, sobbed, and started truly fearing for our future in a new way.\nBut so many other marginalized groups — minorities and people of color, people with diverse religious faiths, the LGBTQIA community, people with disabilities, Native people — have spent most of their lives in fear of hate, violence, and discrimination. \nBecause women of every color, religion, economic status, health, and background deserve equal rights, and because I’ve spent too much time focusing on my own equality, I’m marching on Washington to show solidarity for all women.\n2. To protect my body and my health. \nWhy we march. Who inspires YOU to stand with us on January 21st? Comment below! #WMWArt: @kimothyjoy \nA photo posted by Women's March (@womensmarch) on Jan 7, 2017 at 4:52pm PST \nDonald Trump hasn’t even taken office yet, but Republicans are already hard at work dismantling our country’s healthcare system . The incoming president and his party has made it clear that they want to defund Planned Parenthood, a vital and at times life-saving women’s healthcare organization (that DOES NOT use its federal funding for abortion services, I might add). They also want to rollback reproductive rights by repealing Roe v. Wade .\nBecause I, and every American, deserves access to affordable healthcare, I’m marching on Washington to make it known that I refuse to let my health became a political pawn. And because I, as a woman, refuse to watch 5,000 women a year die from illegal abortions , I’m marching in D.C. to protect the rights and the lives of women who should be the only ones in control of their own bodies and choices.\n3. To stand up for sexual assault victims and against those who commit violence against women. \nA lot of you have been asking what you can do to support the #WomensMarch on Washington. You can start by heading to our @crowdrise page today. [Link in bio.] The Women's March on Washington must raise 100% of the funds needed to cover the cost of logistics and production of the event. This means renting port-a-potties, bus parking fees, safety and security personnel, staging and sound equipment, and much, much more. Your contribution goes directly to these expenses. \nA photo posted by Women's March (@womensmarch) on Dec 15, 2016 at 2:51pm PST \nAs a victim of sexual assault, this past election cycle was traumatic for me . Watching a man who brags about sexually assaulting women be elected into the highest office in the nation not only appalled and disgusted me, but terrified me to my core.\nBecause I refuse to let rape culture be the norm, because I reject the normalization of sexual assault and violence against women, I’m marching on Washington on behalf of myself and the millions of other survivors who deserve to be protected.\n4. To help build a better future for myself and my family. \nLike if you agree! #WMWArt: @kimothyjoy \nA photo posted by Women's March (@womensmarch) on Jan 11, 2017 at 3:41pm PST \nI’m almost 27, and while that sometimes makes me feel ancient, the truth is that my life is just beginning. Is this what I want it to look like? Is this what I want my 7-year-old niece’s life or my 11-year-old nephew’s future to look like?\nBecause I want to live in a world where I don’t have to fear threats of sexual violence, where I have access to healthcare, where I am guaranteed equal pay, and because I want my niece to have all of these opportunities and I want my nephew to support them, I’m marching on D.C. with thousands of other sisters, mothers, and aunts who refuse to let the future look like the past.\n5. To show, without a doubt, that women’s rights are human rights and human rights are women’s rights. \nWho's your #WomensMarchWednesday? Alexandra Kilburn (@kilburnstudio) made this #WMWArt inspired by Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American lawmaker in U.S. history. \nA photo posted by Women's March (@womensmarch) on Jan 11, 2017 at 11:22am PST \nThis is perhaps the simplest and most obvious reason: I’m joining the Women’s March on Washington because, once and for all, it’s time we make it clear that women are humans. No matter what we look like, how old we are, where we’re from, who we love, or who we pray to, we deserve equality.\nI’m marching because I care about the future of my country, and because I demand to have a say in what that future looks like. \nComment if you agree! THE RISE OF THE WOMAN = THE RISE OF THE NATION.
