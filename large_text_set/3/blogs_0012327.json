You learn every day what it means to be a champion. \n\"It's important to stay with this type of player and to learn. But also, for me, they are not young players. For me, they are Chelsea players. \n\"I try to improve all my players in the same way: I work in the same way with the young and old players, and I put great attention in it for them every day. That is normal for me.” \nIn saying that, Conte has yet to decide whether they will all definitely be part of his plans for next season. Academy product: Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Getty Images) \nHe explained: “It's important now to be focused on the present but, for sure, when the right moment comes to face the right situation, we will decide if they need to go on loan to play. For sure, we'll try and take the best decision for the player and for the club. \n\"But I always like to take the decisions together, with the player and the club, and try and make the best decision for the club. \n“They must have this ambition to play in the first-team. It's normal, this. I want to see this ambition, that they want to show me they deserve to play with the first-team. You must be sure, though, if someone deserves to play that they do play.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:45:51.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
