The ZTE Blade V8 Pro looks to be a promising mid-range device, with one really stand out feature: its dual 13MP rear cameras.\nSee also: ZTE ZMAX Pro Review – is a $100 smartphone worth buying? August 8, 2016 We got a chance to get a bit of hands-on time with the Blade V8 Pro during CES. By far, the most impressive thing about this phone is the two rear cameras. One of the lenses is used to get depth information for your images. Basically, this should allow you to take a photo of your subject and put it in sharp focus, based on a particular aperture. Everything else in the image can have a slightly blurred look in the background, which should give your images a more professional look.\nThe camera software in the ZTE Blade V8 Pro will also allow you to quickly change where the focus is in the foreground or background in your images. Again, this is a nice feature that is usually reserved for higher end smartphones, so it’s interesting that it’s available on a more affordable device. The front-facing camera on the phone is more conventional with just one 8MP sensor for making selfies.\n\nAs far as the other hardware aspects of the Blade V8 Pro, it has a 5.5-inch display with Full HD resolution. Inside, there’s a octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, along with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of onboard storage, with a microSD card slot to add up to 128GB of extra storage. It’s also a dual SIM device for people who need two phone numbers on one smartphone.\nZTE decided to ship the phone with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box instead of Nougat, in case you are bothered by that. It has a 3,140mAh battery, which should allow for some decent battery life. For people who are more security conscious, there’s also a fingerprint sensor in the home button for signing into your device.\nPeople who like both USB Type-C ports and your regular 3.5mm headphone jack will be happy to know that both are available on the ZTE Blade V8 Pro. We also noticed that the backing of the phone is made of textured rubber, which should allow people to have a better grip while using it.\nOf course, we got only a few minutes to check out the ZTE Blade V8 Pro at CES 2017, so you might want to wait for our full review before you decide to jump in and purchase this phone. If you are convinced already this is your next Android phone, you are in luck as pre-orders are supposed to begin today at various online retailers for the price of $229.98.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:05:14.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
