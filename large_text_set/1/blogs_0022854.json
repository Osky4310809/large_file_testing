This is one of the best-tasting gluten-free flatbreads you'll ever make, but don't worry — it's super easy! It's soft, moist, and chewy, which for gluten-free foods is hard to come by. It's made from chickpea flour, which adds a subtly sweet flavor, plus it's high in protein and fiber.

You can use for a flatbread pizza , top it with hummus and veggies, or top it with sautéed fruit for a sweet treat . Heck, it even tastes great smeared with good ol' PB&J. \nThe only hard part about this recipe is getting your hands on some chickpea flour, but you can just go to your local health food store and hit up the baking aisle or bulk section, or you can buy some Bob's Read Mill Garbanzo Flour from Amazon. Also note that this recipe takes a little planning ahead as the batter needs at least 30 to 60 minutes to thicken before cooking.
