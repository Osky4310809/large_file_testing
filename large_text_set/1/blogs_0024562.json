It’s a big worry. Is it about the intensity they train at? Liverpool were not good enough or quick enough. \n\"You look at Liverpool’s bench, it is nowhere near good enough. Can and Henderson as a two do not work - I look at the manager. I’m a big fan, but the changes have been far too slow.” \nBut Klopp has hit back, insisting that while results in recent weeks don’t lie, there is not much wrong with his team that a bit of confidence in front of goal would not fix. \nAnd he explained he is not about to throw the baby out with the bathwater by reacting too savagely to the small fixes he has recognised he must make.

If we would doubt the way we are after these little problems, it would be a really strange thing,” he said after the Southampton game . “We don’t have the points we want, we don’t have the results we want, that’s how it is. We can all see that. \n“But it was a really good performance, we just didn’t score. They did good. I’m fine with this, but obviously disappointed about being out. \n“We did the job of creating big chances, but then you have to score. That didn’t happen against Southampton but that’s not a problem in general, it’s only for tonight.” \nKlopp has been criticised as too rigid in the pursuit of his game plan, and even been grouped with Pep Guardiola, having problems of hs own in his debut season at Manchester City, as a manager who refuses to compromise a “purist” pursuit of his methods.
