He shouldn’t do all that stuff just for the wall.”\nCotton attempted to reassure Smith by telling him that “we are a melting pot” and offering rationale for the wall construction.\n“We want Mexico to be a healthy, strong partner,” Cotton said. “But we also have to protect our own citizens, and that’s where the wall comes in.”\nWatch Toby at the town hall above.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:24:41.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
