Just gonna put it out there. No offence but I don't think I would ever see @GNev2 training in a Man City Training shirt pic.twitter.com/fgjOOLqKdl - Danny Simpson (@dannysimpson) March 1, 2017 \nHaving been tagged into the quip, Neville quickly piped up to warn ex-teammate Simpson that he should expect backlash from Carragher, who isn't exactly shy when it comes to sparring on Twitter. You put it out there Daniel!! Good win Monday ... he was very hurt in the studio... https://t.co/5kMVAkZvgo - Gary Neville (@GNev2) March 1, 2017 Oh and be ready for a whack back.... get your helmet on... he's a reckless individual on here... https://t.co/5kMVAkZvgo - Gary Neville (@GNev2) March 1, 2017 \nSure enough, Carragher promptly hit back with a pointed jibe about Leicester's recent performances. More offensive than you lot running around on Monday?!!! https://t.co/Paefz3fqOd - Jamie Carragher (@Carra23) March 1, 2017 \nSimpson did his best to temporarily quell the storm, pronouncing his respect for Carra before signing off with another cutting comment about the pair's respective trophy hauls. @Carra23 I respect your opinion, and as a defender I look up to you and what you've achieved. However i won the league you haven't - Danny Simpson (@dannysimpson) March 1, 2017 \nOf course, Carragher had a suitably withering comeback prepared. Thought you had more? You part of those joke players at Man U who claimed titles after 5 games a season?!! Quiet on Seville Daniel. �� https://t.co/UWu1hZwIiA - Jamie Carragher (@Carra23) March 1, 2017 \nAt which point the Foxes defender surrendered and bowed out with a series of laughter emojis. - Danny Simpson (@dannysimpson) March 1, 2017 \nPhew. We nearly had a full scale riot on our hands there. \nFor the record, many football fans were quick to point out that Carragher grew up supporting Everton and hence still has a soft spot for the Toffees despite dedicating his entire career to Liverpool. \nHowever, as the man himself pointed out, the ex-Red had an even better reason for spending his day at Finch Farm dressed head to toe in enemy colours: Duncan Ferguson told him to. \nChris covers the funny side of the game for ESPN FC in the Toe Poke blog.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:19:08.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
