(Kevin Winter/Getty Images for EBMRF) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Sunday, January 15, 2017, 4:42 PM \nBrad Pitt reemerged in the spotlight Saturday after keeping a low profile for months following his split from Angelina Jolie. \nThe A-list actor seemed to be in strong spirits as he made the rounds at a charity concert in Malibu, where a bevy of stars turned out to raise awareness for a serious skin disease called epidermolysis bullosa. \nPitt, 53, attended the Rock4EB! Charity gig with his pals and musicians Sting and Chris Cornell, who headlined the event. The \"Allied\" actor was seen socializing throughout the evening, shaking hands and sharing laughs with others on hand, according to People. A video posted by Filipa Constante (@filipaconstante) on Jan 14, 2017 at 8:23pm PST \nHe later took the stage during the concert, where he jokingly imitated Sting in front of the laughing crowd. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie through the years \nPitt also introduced Cornell before he took the stage, calling him a \"someone I've known for quite a while and that I'm a huge fan of.\" \nPitt was far from the only big name at Saturday's charity event, which was hosted by Zach Galifianakis. Courteney Cox, Kaley Cuoco and David Spade were among the other stars in attendance. Pitt(left) joined Sting (right) and Chris Cornell at the star-studded event.
