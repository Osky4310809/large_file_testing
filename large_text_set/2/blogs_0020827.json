Beyoncé has a secret Snapchat , and people are so desperate to find it that they’re absolutely and hilariously freaking out.\nYesterday (February 23rd) was a big news day for Queen B. The singer, who recently revealed she’s expecting twins , pulled out of her headline slot at this year’s Coachella , much to the chagrin of festival goers and fans . Saying that, however, the singer and her management did announce that she planned to headline the festival in 2018 once those Beybies are born.\nWhat’s more, Bey also broke her self-imposed social media silence yesterday to support transgender youth , and we love that she’s speaking up on this important matter. \n& #LGBTQ students need to know we support them.

Yesterday Beyoncé shared a rare candid picture on to Instagram with her daughter Blue Ivy and it had Snapchat filters on it.\n\nA post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 23, 2017 at 2:07pm PST \nNow, as far as we know, Beyoncé doesn’t have a public Snapchat account, but it seems that this photo proves otherwise. In fact, Bey is pretty private when it comes to how she presents herself, just take a look at her baby bump photoshoots (yes there were multiple). Basically, if Beyoncé doesn’t want us to know something then, well, we won’t\nYet that hasn’t stopped members of the Beyhive hilariously losing it on social media.\nWHATS YOUR SNAPCHAT? @Beyonce pic.twitter.com/HKAP6pc5Gk \n— Fatima (@ANTlFatima) February 23, 2017 We can do this the easy way, or the hard way.
