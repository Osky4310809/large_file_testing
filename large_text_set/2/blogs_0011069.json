Senior point guard Bronson Koenig was out with a calf injury. Michigan is now 7-6 in conference play while Wisconsin, at 10-3 in the Big Ten, is in a three way tie for first with Maryland and Purdue. \nMichigan never really ran away with it—it was 31-30 at the half and close until the last few minutes—but this play, punctuated by a Wagner dunk, is a good encapsulation of how Michigan ran away with it.
