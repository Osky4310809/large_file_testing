The ban began under Trump’s executive order to shut down our refugee program for 120 days and pause travel from terrorist-compromised countries for 90 days in an effort to keep possible terrorists from entering the U.S. \nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll found that nearly a majority of 49 percent “strongly” or “somewhat” agreed with the ban, while 41 percent “strongly” or “somewhat” disagreed. Another ten percent were undecided. Thirty-one percent of all respondents said they feel “more safe” with the ban in effect, but 26 percent feel “less safe” as a result of the executive order. \nNot surprisingly, it was more popular among Republicans than it was among Democrats, with a majority 51 percent of Republicans “strongly” agreed while 53 percent of Democrats “strongly” disagreed. \nThe travel ban has been controversial because of the disorganized way in which it was implemented, leaving many people detained at airports overnight, and even sent back to the Middle East in some cases. Some Republicans spoke out against the order , while the administration argued that even calling it a “ban” was misleading even after using that word themselves. \nThe public furor following the order led to protests and boycotts , forcing Trump’s trip to be cancelled to a Harley-Davidson factory out of fear of the protests. Even former President Obama broke the traditional silence expected from criticizing the sitting president to say that he disagreed with the order and defended against comparisons to his refugee program freeze in 2011. The poll was conducted with 1,201 respondents and had an error margin of 3 percentage points for the total, and 5 percentage points for the partisan findings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:32:57.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
