Officials said no American carriers were affected by the ban Credit: Getty Images \nA ccording to US media reports, American intelligence officials have been given a \"credible\" tip-off that Isil has been developing explosives that can been hidden in electronics. \nYesterday Downing Street announced that more than 2 million passengers a year flying on airlines including British Airways, Thomson, Thomas Cook and Easyjet will be prevented from taking devices larger than a mobile phone into the cabin. \nInstead, anyone flying from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia will have to put electronic devices in their hold luggage, despite concerns they could be stolen or damaged.

The ban will hit tablets, laptops, handheld games consoles, e-readers such as Kindles and portable DVD players. \nInsurers warned that laptops and tablets are not typically covered by policies for loss, damage or theft if they are placed in the hold.

International airports affected by electronics ban \nT om Fletcher, the Former Number 10 foreign policy adviser, said Donald Trump's use of Twitter risked undermining the anti-IS coalition. \nHe said today's meeting in Washington should be used by the US administration to demonstrate it is committed to the long-term stability of the region affected by the terror group. \nMr Fletcher told BBC Radio 4's Today.\"The main focus of this meeting in Washington is that we need to hear from America in particular that they are still committed to that effort, because what we are seeing is big cuts to the humanitarian and the state-building budgets which are so important to rebuilding Iraq, and that's accompanied by all these late-night tweets from the White House which often undermine confidence. \n\"In the middle of the night from the White House you get a range of different messages. This needs the sort of calm, trust-building, rational approach and those aren't great hallmarks of the White House Twitter strategy so far.\" Share this article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T11:06:03.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
