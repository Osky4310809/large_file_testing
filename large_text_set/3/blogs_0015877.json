The latest study found that those kinds of foods started picking up bacteria after five seconds, so your best bet in that case is toss anything you drop on the floor. \nMostly, it comes down to preference. If the idea of eating food that’s been on the floor grosses you out, feel free to toss. But if it doesn’t faze you?
