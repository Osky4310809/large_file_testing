By Miguel Otárola Star Tribune February 1, 2017 — 6:01pm Purchase: Order Reprint The Eden Prairie Outdoor Center, a refurbished cabin that serves as an environmental education space, is making a hoot about its newest member: a male barred owl who's in need of a name. The city of Eden Prairie published a Facebook post about the bird on Wednesday, asking people to leave their name suggestions in the comments. \"It'll be fun to see what people come up with,\" Center supervisor Stan Tekiela said. The owl was found injured outside Chicago and could not be released back into the wild. The Outdoor Center, home to about 25 animals, acquired him in early December, Tekiela said. \"We are an environmental education center, and we use this bird for education,\" he said. \"We do educational programs to teach people about wildlife through animal ambassadors.\" Barred owls, also known as hoot owls, are found across North America. This particular one is fairly large, with a yellow beak, a streaked feather pattern and dark brown eyes. \"Every bird is unique and has its own personality,\" Tekiela said. \"This one tends to be real calm and congenial.\" The city will accept names through Wednesday, Feb. 8. Tekiela and his team will choose from the suggestions the following week. The Eden Prairie Outdoor Center is located on the north shore of Staring Lake, at 13765 Staring Lake Pkwy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:07:52.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
