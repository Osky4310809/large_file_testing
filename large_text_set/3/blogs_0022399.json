Now, the Korean tech giant has officially confirmed that the Galaxy S8 will be equipped with Bixby, and has revealed the assistant’s features. The assistant even gets its own dedicated button on the Galaxy S8 . \nAccording to Samsung, Bixby isn’t like other virtual assistants on the smartphones. Instead, it will learn and adapt to users to offer a better experience than the competitors because of its proficiency. Samsung also mentioned three key properties of the assistant – completeness, context awareness and cognitive tolerance. \nSamsung said that Bixby will support almost any task that you can perform via touch inside an app, and not just a limited subset. However, it’s worth mentioning that these apps need to support Bixby. Users will be able to summon the assistant at any time, even while using an app. \nThe cognitive tolerance property of Bixby will allow it to understand commands with incomplete information and trigger the required task. The brand said that this makes this makes the interface more natural and easier to use. \nThe company revealed that by the time the Galaxy S8 launches, by March 29th i.e., a subset of pre-installed apps will be Bixby-enabled. The brand will be launching more apps that support Bixby in the future. Also, it will release a tool to enable third-party app developers to make their apps and services compatible with Bixby easily.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T11:59:45.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
