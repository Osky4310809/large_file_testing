Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports \nIt’s been nearly nine years since the Boston Celtics won their 17th NBA championship in franchise history, and one former Celtics player thought it was time for a reunion. \nFormer C’s point guard Rajon Rondo recently told The Undefeated that he was planning a get-together for all the members of the historic 2007-08 Celtics squad. \nDespite being an integral part of the title run, Rondo revealed that Ray Allen would not be invited to the celebration, as Allen’s tenure with the Miami Heat apparently frayed the relationship between he and some of his former Celtics teammates. \nWhile Allen will not be in attendance, Rondo told The Undefeated every other member of the team was at least invited to the reunion, even P.J. Brown, who was required as a bought-out player following the trade deadline in 2008. \nWell, apparently Rondo’s remarks weren’t entirely true, as the current Chicago Bulls point guard evidently failed to extend the invitation to one of his former teammates — Scot Pollard. \nRing a bell? No? Well, that makes sense. \nPollard only managed to get into 22 games over the course of the 2007-08 season, and averaged under eight minutes of playing time per game. Still, he was a member of the NBA title-winning squad, and didn’t even know about the gathering until he read The Undefeated’s piece, which he reacted to on Twitter. \nI haven't heard about this. I wasn't on that team? Rondo must have forgotten the time(s) I talked him down after Doc rode him hard. Ubuntu? pic.twitter.com/ajs8ztjRPf \n— Scot Pollard (@ScotPollard31) March 20, 2017 \nIt sounds like Pollard is somewhat offended by the lack of invitation, but can you blame him? That can’t feel good. \nThis article first appeared on NESN.com and was syndicated with permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T08:12:48.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
