(Rodger Mallison/Star-Telegram via AP) AP Fort Worth Police Chief Joel Fitzgerald speaks at a press conference to announce the discipline for Officer William Martin, whose arrest of a woman became a viral video on social media, Monday, Jan. 9, 2017. Martin was suspended without pay for 10 days, but will not be fired, after an incident in which he was caught on video wrestling a black woman and her daughter to the ground, Fitzgerald announced Monday. (Rodger Mallison/Star-Telegram via AP) AP \nTalk about a textbook case in police politics. \nThe situation involving a white Fort Worth police officer suspended after a viral video showed him wrestling a black mother to the ground and then detaining her two teen daughters is getting worse every day. \nNow, we've got a state lawmaker, State Rep. Nicole Collier, D-Fort Worth, suggesting the Department of Justice should investigate the matter. \nWe've also learned that Police Chief Joel Fitzgerald, who is black, evidently offered to promote the officer, William Martin, if he agreed to take a seven-day suspension with no appeal. That didn't fly, so the chief suspended Martin for 10 days without pay instead. \nAnd come to find out, all that stuff Fitzgerald told us about Martin being \"contrite\" and \"ready to get back to work\" was a smokescreen used to cove up racial divisions within the community and his own department. Police chief says Fort Worth officer's treatment of mother, 2 daughters was rude but not racist \nNot only has Martin appealed his discipline, the predominantly white Fort Worth Police Officers Association has criticized Fitzgerald for over-stepping his bounds by offering Martin a deal that still subjects the officer to a potential excessive force charge. \nMeanwhile, the Fort Worth Black Law Enforcement Officers Association - which called for the last police chief to step down over claims of racial discrimination and harassment within the department - rallied to Fitzgerald's defense. \nWith several prominent black community leaders calling on the chief to fire Martin, the black police association said \"the disciplinary actions issued not only perpetuates negative stereotypes of the police, it also jeopardizes existing relationships and efforts with minority communities.\" \nThe black officer association \"also believes the discipline imposed by Chief Fitzgerald was not remotely close to being heavy handed.\" Fort Worth officer in viral video passed over promotion to appeal punishment \nSo, if you're keeping score at home, it looks like Chief Gerald is 0 for 4: Martin isn't happy. The family of Jacqueline Craig, the mother who was taken to the ground, isn't pleased. The minority community isn't satisfied. And Fitzgerald's troops - not to mention his command staff -- are bitterly divided. Fort Worth officer's suspension criticized: 'You would get more justice if someone kicked a dog' \nFitzgerald, by the way, is turning down requests for interviews - including mine. \nHis input would have been helpful. But whatever he might have said the fact is this: policing in America has become a constant struggle driven by racial division and too often pitting uniformed officers against the communities they serve. \nForth Worth is just today's example.Cowtown has stepped in a stinking cow patty. \nWhen I first saw the viral video, I was ticked off at how Martin treated the woman and wondered if he should be able to keep his gun and badge. \nCraig had called on Dec. 21 to complain that a next-door neighbor had choked her 7-year-old son for refusing to pick up trash. But the officer, rather than assuring the mother that he was taking the complaint seriously, got into a war of words, asking her, \"Why don't you teach your son not to litter.\" \nCraig, understandably, goes on the offensive. \n\"\"You don't know what I teach him,\" she shot back.\"Whatever you teach your kids don't mean they go by your rules when they're not in your sight.\" \nThe feud between Martin and Craig intensified, the woman's 15-year-old daughter stepped between them and all hell broke loose. Martin pressed a stun gun into Craig's back and wrestled her to the ground. \nHe then moved toward the 15-year-old, forced her to the ground and slapped handcuffs on her, too. After that, he arrested the girl's 19-year-old sister, who was yelling at and cursing the officer while live-streaming the whole encounter on social media. Fort Worth officer turns feud between neighbors into racially charged powder keg \nRather than calming the woman down or showing any empathy, Martin escalated the conflict, which cast him and the Craig family in a dangerous standoff that could easily have turned out worse. \nBut when Fitzgerald stepped forth last week and said that, after reviewing all the evidence -- including other videos and eyewitness accounts - he didn't think the officer deserved to be fired, I wasn't surprised. \nIn fact, it struck me as a measured response in the face of external pressure to dump Martin and the internal pressure the chief faced to stand by his officer. \n\"But the buck stops here,\" the chief said. \nWhat initially drew me into the chief's corner was Fitzgerald's characterization of the officer. He said Martin was \"contrite\" and \"ready to get back to work. He's very sorry for what has transpired.\" \nNot quite. \nMartin didn't do the chief any favors by fighting his punishment, a move that will drag this thing out for weeks to come, if not longer, and keep the chief on the hot seat. \nTo make matters worse, it came to light this week that Martin was offered a promotion - yes, a promotion -- to corporal if he'd accept a seven-day suspension and waive his right to appeal. \nThe chief owes the people in Fort Worth an explanation about that one. From here, 30 miles to the west, it looks like he was throwing a bone to the community while appeasing his command staff and the influential police association. \nAnd it all backfired on him. \nMartin's attorney, Terry Daffron, said the officer was worried about a potential criminal charge since the Tarrant County District Attorney plans to refer the case to a grand jury, which would decide if anyone involved in the incident should be charged with a crime. \n\"One of the things that troubled Martin and myself was that the police department's use-of-force expert did not find any use-of-force violations,\" Daffron told the Star-Telegram . \"By him taking the offer, especially with him facing a grand jury, the excessive-force allegation is something that could have been used against him.\" \nIt should be used against him, said the Rev. K.P. Tatum Sr., an architect of the Faith and Community Leaders United group of pastors that has been working with the city to improve relations between the police department and the minority community. Rev. K.P. Tatum, Sr. addresses the media during a press conference at Beth Eden Baptist Church on Saturday, Dec. 24, 2016, in Fort Worth, Texas. A group of North Texas pastors expressed support for Police Chief Joel Fitzgerald and elected officials but denounced the Fort Worth police officer who was captured in a viral video arresting Jacqueline Craig and her two teenage daughters. (Smiley N. Pool/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nTatum said the 10-day suspension is \"not enough, and if he [Martin] was a real man, he'd step down.\" \n\"When we've given you a license to kill, then you abuse that power by pointing a Taser gun at a 15-year-old girl and her mother, that's unacceptable. That mentality is what we've been fighting for years.\" \nAnd this fight between police and the black community, unfortunately, is one we've seen far too many times, with no relief in sight.
