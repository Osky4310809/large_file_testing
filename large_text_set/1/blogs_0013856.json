Concerned groups can also bring the matter before the Supreme Court to question the constitutionality of martial rule. \nDuterte invoked that he may declare martial law in order to “preserve the nation” once the drug problem becomes “virulent.” \n“You know, I have to protect the Filipino people. It’s my duty. And I’d tell you now, if I have to declare martial law, I will declare it – not about invasion, insurrection; not about danger,” he said. \n“I will declare martial law to preserve my nation – period. I don’t care about the Supreme Court or… because the thing, the right to preserve one’s life and my nation, my country transcends everything else, even the limitation,” Duterte pointed out. \nDuterte parried criticisms, saying the declaration can be made if it is needed to “preserve the nation.” \n“And l will just say, why are you declaring martial law? Because I have to preserve the Filipino people and the youth of this land. That’s what I said,” he added.
