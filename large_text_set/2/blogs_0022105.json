Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!\" he wrote on Twitter. I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nHis refusal to attend comes amid reports that media outlets like CNN and MSNBC have been considering skipping the event at the Washington Hilton. Trump's move comes in the heat of his ongoing battle with the media, which he has labeled the opposition party and \"fake news.\" \nVarious prominent political correspondents promptly responded to Trump's announcement: The dinner, a major fundraiser for an organization that represents the free press covering the WH, will go on--and be a success, I'm sure. https://t.co/i9dhTZ6ja7 \n— Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) February 25, 2017 Trump's decision to decline @WHCA invite to dinner, which is April 29 at Washington Hilton, comes day after controversy over pooled gaggle. https://t.co/Ny5XiiH9Gk \n— Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) February 25, 2017 My suggestion, let @AlecBaldwin play @POTUS at the dinner. Now that could work. \n— AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) February 25, 2017 \nA high-profile comedian usually hosts the event in which the president is roasted by the comedian and the president roasts the media. The annual dinner began in 1920, and was scheduled to take place on April 29 at the Washington Hilton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:37:50.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
