The number of people reporting they are on zero-hour contracts has soared (Photo: ONS) \nThe figures are gathered by asking workers themselves what type of contract they are on. \nThat means there was a sharp rise in 2012 and 2013 as awareness rose of the contracts, which Labour leaders Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn have campaigned to ban, the ONS said. \nThis time, the ONS said, \"all of the increase is from people in their job for more than a year, while there was a small decrease for those less than 12 months. \n\"This could reflect either increased recognition or people moving on to a zero-hours contract with the same employer.\" Ed Miliband made banning zero-hour contracts a key 2015 election pledge (Photo: Getty) \nAlmost 32 million people are now in work, a jump of 92,000 over the quarter and 315,000 compared with a year earlier. \nThe number of people on the claimant count, including Jobseeker's Allowance and those on Universal Credit required to seek work, fell by 11,300 last month to 734,700, the lowest since May 1975. \nAverage earnings increased by 2.2% in the year to January, down by 0.4% on the previous month. The number of people claiming jobseekers' allowance is now the lowest since 1975 (Photo: Getty) \nDavid Freeman, senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"With the unemployment rate last lower in summer 1975 and the employment rate still at a record high, the labour market remains robust. \n\"But smaller wage increases and higher inflation mean the growth in real earnings has slowed sharply in recent months.\" \nDan Tomlinson of the Resolution Foundation think-tank said: \"The number of people on zero-hours contracts has reached an all-time high at the end of last year, further confirming that they are now a permanent feature of our jobs market. \n\"But the zero-hours juggernaut is showing signs of slowing down, with barely any increase during the second half of 2016.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:37:44.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
