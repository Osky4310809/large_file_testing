He should have been out for a golden duck too in that innings. \nThat’s the second-worst series average by an Australian opener in India ever (minimum four innings), behind Rick Darling’s 1979 campaign. David Warner fell for six in Australia’s second innings. Source: AP \nDarling averaged 9.25 that series – though it should be said he only batted four times – and was never selected again. \nThis is not the first time Warner has struggled in India. In 2013 he averaged 24.57 across seven innings at the top of the order as Australia sunk to a 4-0 series loss. That stands as the third worst series average by an Australian opener in India, just behind this year’s tour. \nBut it’s not just India where Warner has struggled. \nLION AT HOME, LAMB ABROAD \nThe punchy left-hander averages a remarkable 59.21 in home Tests. That number climbs up to 60.11 across his 58 innings at the top of the order in Australia. That’s the third best average of any opener who has ever played at least 10 home Tests and the best of any Australian. \nThe numbers away from home aren’t so flash, however. Outside Australia he only averages 36.61, and the only other countries he averages above 40 are the United Arab Emirates (37.06) and South Africa (90.50). In four countries he averages less than 30 – India (24.25), New Zealand (13.00), Sri Lanka (27.16) and the West Indies (26.90). \nHe’s now had seven series in which he has averaged less than 30, and all of them have been away from home. Lyon's takes another five 1:02 \nAnd while Warner has scored the ninth most Test centuries (14) in Australia in history, he has only reached triple figures four times overseas and not once since 2014. \nAt 30 years old, Warner has time to turn this record around but we’ve gone well beyond the stage where the disparity between his numbers at home and away cannot be considered a coincidence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:51:31.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
