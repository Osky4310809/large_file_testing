He has faulted liberals for an “overweening addiction to the courtroom” and last year hailed Scalia as a “lion of the law.”\nA study led by Mercer University law professor Jeremy Kidd concluded that Gorsuch is the second-most similar to Scalia of the 21 prospective justices on a list Trump released during the campaign.\nHe serves on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, where he has made a name for himself as a graceful writer. Gorsuch is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, and served as a law clerk to Justices Anthony Kennedy and fellow Coloradan Byron White. If confirmed, he would be the first justice to serve with a colleague for whom he once worked.\nRelated Whether Trump picks Neil Gorsuch or Thomas Hardiman for Supreme Court, expect a showdown Whether Trump’s immigration ban targets Muslims key to potential First Amendment challenges With a clear, colloquial writing style, Gorsuch has written in favour of courts’ second-guessing government regulations, in defence of religious freedom and skeptically about law enforcement. He has contended that courts give too much deference to government agencies’ interpretations of statutes. He sided with two groups that mounted religious objections to the Obama administration’s requirements that employers provide health insurance that includes contraception for women.\nDavid Lane, a prominent Denver plaintiff’s attorney who frequently clashes with law enforcement, praised Gorsuch as fair and open-minded. Lane won a $1.8 million jury verdict against the Denver Police Department in a brutality and wrongful arrest case. The city appealed and the case ended up before Gorsuch. Lane said the judge tore into the city’s lawyers and urged them to go to mediation rather than drag out appeals for years to deny the plaintiffs their reward. The mediation led the case to be settled for $1.6 million.\n“He is a very, very smart man. His leanings are very conservative, but he’s qualified to be on the Supreme Court,” Lane said. “I don’t know that Judge Gorsuch has a political agenda and he is sincere and honest and believes what he writes.”\nHe is the son of President Ronald Reagan’s Environmental Protection Agency chief, Anne Gorsuch. He worked for two years in George W. Bush’s Justice Department before Bush appointed him to his appeals court seat. He was confirmed by a voice vote in 2006.\nGorsuch has written 175 majority opinions and 65 concurrences or dissents in his decade on the 10th Circuit, according to Rebecca Love Kourlis, a former Colorado Supreme Court justice.\nGorsuch also is a notable advocate for simplifying the justice system to make it more accessible, Kourlis said.\nThe nomination comes amid the controversy over Trump’s order restricting travel into the U.S. by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Monday night after she refused to uphold his executive order. That move angered Democrats, who vowed an all-out fight against his nomination of Jeff Sessions as attorney general and set the stage for an even bigger clash over the high court vacancy.\nDemocrats will be hard-pressed to stop the nomination given the 52-48 advantage Republicans hold in the Senate. Under current rules, Republicans will need 60 votes to bring the nomination to the House floor. Some Democrats say they will insist Republicans reach that threshold.\n“It’s really important we have a mainstream nominee, and the way to do that is to require a super-majority vote, as we have now,” Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said Monday before the nomination was announced.\nEven so, Republicans could eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court appointments with a simple majority vote. Senator Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed lawmakers will confirm Trump’s nominee.\nOpponents will seek to “paint whoever is nominated in apocalyptic terms,” McConnell said on the Senate floor Monday. “It doesn’t matter who this president nominates, the left has been rolling out the same tired playbook for decades.”\nDemocrats are still smarting from Senate Republicans’ refusal to consider former President Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Scalia seat. That nomination would have given the court a majority of Democratic appointees for the first time since 1969.\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said that while Democrats may not like the “political or philosophical background” of the president’s pick, “the criteria in terms of academia background, time on the bench, the expertise and criteria meets the intent of both Republicans and Democrats.”\nIf Democrats decide to filibuster, the fate of Trump’s nominee could rest in the hands of McConnell. Trump has encouraged McConnell to change the rules of the Senate and make it impossible to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee — a change known in the Senate as the “nuclear option.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:29:39.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
