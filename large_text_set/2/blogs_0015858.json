Very lucky. \nHuddersfield deserved at least a replay at the Etihad on Tuesday week. In fact, with a little good fortune they would now be in the quarter-finals. Huddersfield were good value for their draw against City (Photo: REUTERS) David Wagner's side performed far more determinedly than Pep Guardiola's (Photo: AFP) \nTerriers boss David Wagner said: “We had two or three chances – and one very good chance. \n“That we have created those chances against one of the best teams in Europe, so I am very happy. \n“We stuck to our own identity. We were aggressive and we were brave – and that makes me very proud. \n“I am happy to have the rematch in a great environment like the Etihad. \n“Like all football matches, I don't know if we will win, but I believe that we can go to Manchester and perform.” View gallery \nHuddersfield, of course, are no lower division whipping boys. \nAnd Wagner himself made seven team changes as he looks towards this week's crucial Championship clash with Reading. \nThe difference was that the home side attacked the occasion. \nIn contrast City's players just didn't seem to fancy it in windy conditions and on a lively pitch with even livelier opponents.

Jack Payne's free-kick was tipped over by Bravo and when the outstanding Philip Billing did fire into the roof of the net, it took an offside flag to wreck his celebration.
