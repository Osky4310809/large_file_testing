Four hundred years before the War of the Five Kings , the entire Valyrian empire and almost all of its dragons were destroyed in a single day, during a cataclysmic volcanic eruption known as the Doom of Valyria . One Valyrian noble family, the Targaryens , survived the Doom on the distant island outpost of Dragonstone in the Narrow Sea - along with the last surviving Valyrian dragons. \nOne hundred years later, Aegon I Targaryen and his sisters used the last three surviving dragons in the world to conquer and unify the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. For generations, the dragon-kings ruled over much of Westeros - but the dragons eventually died out after nearly a century and a half, and the species was subsequently considered to be extinct, the oldest dragon Vhagar living up to 181 years. Edit A dragon egg, used as an heirloom or item of value. \nIn the ï»¿series the dragon species is established as having been extinct for many years. The only thing left of the race are petrified dragon eggs, which are used as decoration, and the bones which are used for weapon crafting. According to one legend, dragons originated from a second moon that hatched when it drifted too close to the sun. This is mostly dismissed as a simple myth. \nThey remain the sigil of House Targaryen , who were known to have a special affinity with the creatures. Even Daenerys Targaryen who knows nothing of her true heritage feels a connection with the relics of the ancient animals. She appears to feel a connection with the eggs; causing her to develop a curiosity about the race and the possibility that there may still be living dragons. Daenerys' dragon eggs, gifted to her by Illyrio Mopatis. \nDaenerys is given three petrified dragon eggs as a gift for her wedding to Khal Drogo. The three eggs are black, green, and gold. [1] \nDaenerys begins caring for the eggs as they become richer in color. She keeps them in a chest surrounded by candles, day and night as is drawn to them. [2] \nArya stumbles upon the massive skull of one of the Targaryen dragons while chasing a cat in the vaults. She hides in the mouth of the skull and overhears the plotting of Illyrio and Varys . [3] The skull of a dragon, kept in the vaults below the Red Keep of King's Landing. \nDaenerys continues to experiment with her eggs. She briefly places one of the eggs into a fire pit in an attempt to hatch it, but the egg remains unhatched. She removes the egg from the fire with her bare hands, but remains unhurt. [4] \nDaenerys Targaryen places the eggs on the funeral pyre of her husband after smothering him with a pillow. She also straps the witch Mirri Maz Duur to the pyre. She then lights the pyre, and walks into it, with all her followers believing her to be dead. In the morning however, she is found with three dragons, a green dragon in her arms, a black dragon clinging on her shoulder and a white-peach colored dragon clinging on her leg. A little moment later, the black dragon screeches and flaps his wings. [5] Edit Daenerys tries to feed Drogon raw meat. \nDaenerys tries unsuccessfully to feed her dragons raw meat, unsure of what she is doing wrong. [6] Later, in Qarth , she realizes that they will only eat cooked meat. She coaxes them into recognizing the Valyrian command, \" Dracarys ,\" to breathe fire, so they can cook their own food. [7] \nDuring her stay in Qarth, word of the dragons' return begins to travel to other parts of Essos; the rumors are eventually picked up by Varys , who mentions them to Tyrion Lannister . Tyrion is more concerned with the impending Battle of the Blackwater than with newly hatched dragons on the other side of the world. [8] \nThe dragons are later stolen by the warlocks of Qarth and hidden in the House of the Undying . [9] The warlocks and Xaro Xhoan Daxos carry out a coup to seize control of the city in the wake of the theft. Pyat Pree invites Daenerys to come to the House of the Undying and be reunited with her 'babies'. [10] Dany's dragons breathe fire in \" Valar Morghulis .\" \nOnce Daenerys is inside the citadel she is enthralled by two specific illusions; the Iron Throne room with a destroyed roof and snow falling in and the illusion of her dead husband and child. The sound of the crying dragons pulls Daenerys out of the temptation to stay in either illusion. Continuing her search for her dragons she finds them all chained beside each other, and they scream with excitement when she nears them. Daenerys goes to them, only to find herself chained as well. With her arms stretched to either side of her she becomes a captive. However with a bit of a twisted smile, Daenerys speaks the High Valyrian word for fire, and Drogon first answers her call, but isn't very effective by himself. However, both Rhaegal and Viserion then join in, setting Pyat Pree ablaze. [11] Edit Drogon kills Kraznys. \nDaenerys arrives with her dragons in Slaver's Bay , hoping to acquire an army of Unsullied . With nothing else to pay the slave-masters, she offers them her largest dragon, Drogon, in exchange for all eight thousand of their Unsullied soldiers. [12] However, the deal is a ruse; after slave master Kraznys mo Nakloz gives her the whip signifying ownership of the Unsullied army, the dragon remains loyal to her. Revealing to everyone that she speaks Valyrian fluently, she orders her new army to slay all of the slave-masters within the city. Daenerys then commands Drogon to attack Kraznys: the slave master is consumed in a powerful jet of Drogon's fire-breath. Drogon and the other dragons then provide air support for the Unsullied as they sack Astapor , burning more of the slave-masters and their personal guards. Afterwards, Daenerys's new army triumphantly leaves Astapor marching in formation, with her three dragons flying above. [13] \nWhen Daenerys besieges Yunkai next, she keeps her three dragons in her tent when she receives the Yunkish ambassador Razdal mo Eraz , in order to intimidate him. At one point she casually throws a piece of meat to them and they playfully fight over it, much to Razdal's consternation. Daenerys ultimately rejects Razdal's offer to leave Yunkai alone in exchange for a gift of gold, but chooses to keep the gold anyway. When Razdal's slaves attempt to retrieve it the dragons scare them away. After Razdal threatens Daenerys the dragons grew more agitated: Daenerys points out that he had threatened their \"mother\", and while she had promised him safe passage as an ambassador, her dragons did not . Razdal leaves in frustration. [14] \nDaenerys ultimately decides not to risk endangering her young dragons again by deploying them against Yunkai, but sends in an infiltration mission consisting of Daario Naharis , Jorah Mormont, and the Unsullied commander Grey Worm . After fighting their way through the city they free the slaves and start a general uprising. [15] When the Yunkish leaders surrender and allow their two hundred thousand slaves to leave the city, they are received by Daenerys and her army as her dragons circle overhead. [16] Edit Viserion and Rhaegal imprisoned underneath the pyramid by Daenerys. \nDuring her journey to Meereen , Daenerys' dragons have grown larger than they were before, feasting on a dead sheep. While scuffling over the carcass, Daenerys attempted to calm Drogon down, but the black dragon snapped at his mother due to his state in a feeding frenzy. Jorah then reminded Daenerys that dragons can never be tamed, not even by their own mother. [17] \nAfter Daenerys claimed Meereen as its queen, Drogon continues to hunt for their food independently, burning and killing livestocks of farmers that live around the Meereenese region. [18] Seeing that her children have grown wild and reckless, Daenerys decided to lock two of her three dragons, Viserion and Rhaegal, within the Great Pyramid, while the third and largest one, Drogon, was nowhere to be found. [19] Edit Rhaegal and Viserion defying their mother's presence. \nDaenerys visit Rhaegal and Viserion after not seeing them for weeks. She soon sees they have grown larger and more aggressive than they were before. Realizing that her own children have turned against her, Daenerys has no choice but to keep her distance from them. [20] When Ser Barristan Selmy was murdered by the Sons of the Harpy , Daenerys feed one of the Great Masters to her dragons to make example of what happens when someone defies her rule. [21] Drogon defending Daenerys from the Sons of the Harpy. \nWhen the Sons of the Harpy attempted to assassinate Daenerys during the Great Games at the Daznak's Pit , Drogon flew in to protect his mother. Despite being injured, the black dragon managed to kill many Sons of the Harpy by tearing some with his teeth and burning the rest with his flames. Afterwards, he flew off north from the pit with Daenerys on his back. [22] Edit Tyrion faces the two dragons. \nAt the Great Pyramid in Meereen , Tyrion , Varys , Grey Worm and Missandei discuss the two remaining dragons locked beneath their feet. Grey Worm reports the dragons aren't eating, Tyrion proclaims it's because Dragons don't do well in captivity. He talks of their intelligence and how the Targaryens raised and locked up their dragons, leading to their extinction. He and Varys visit the dragons, claiming he's a friend of their mother, and releases them from their collars. [23] Drogon and Dany are reunited. \nWhen the Red Priestess Kinvara comes to Meereen from Volantis , she notes to Tyrion and Varys that Daenerys's dragons are gifts from the Lord of Light , and they can burn the sins for those who has lack of faith in the Targaryen queen. [24] \nWhile Daenerys's khalasar are riding to Meereen, she reunites with Drogon, who has grown about double in size. [25] She rode on his back to further her leadership strength to the Dothraki. Afterwards, Drogon flies Daenerys back to Meereen, which is being attacked by the Masters . [26] \nWhen Daenerys refuses to surrender Meereen to the Masters, Drogon lands right by her side before allowing her to ride on his back. After the pair take flight, Rhaegal and Viserion break out of the Great Pyramid to join their mother and brother in burning the Masters' ships with dragon fire. [27] \nAfter the Second Siege of Meereen was won and the war over the Liberation of Slaver's Bay ended, the three Dragons fly west alongside Daenerys's newly acquired armada towards Westeros .
