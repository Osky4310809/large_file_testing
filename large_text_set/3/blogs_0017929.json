Saxena March 20, 2017 at 7:01am Share on Facebook Share Tweet Email Email Print Advertisement - story continues below \nCNN host Fareed Zakaria used profanity Friday evening while explaining to fellow network host Don Lemon his belief that President Donald Trump’s life and presidency were based on what he has dubbed “bulls**t.” \n“He [Trump] has spent his whole life bulls**tting,” Zakaria maintained. “He has succeeded by bulls**tting. He has gotten the presidency by bulls**tting. It’s very hard to tell somebody at that point that bulls*** doesn’t work because look at results. Right?” \n“But that’s what he does,” he continued. “He sees something [and] he doesn’t particularly care if it’s true or not. Just puts it out there and then he puts something else out.” Advertisement - story continues below Trump Promises Tax Reform Will Be Reaganesque In Scope \nThe host’s focus reportedly lay primarily on the assertion made by Trump on Twitter earlier this month that former President Barack Obama had purposefully and maliciously wiretapped his Trump Tower office late in the 2016 presidential campaign. Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 \nIn defending his position, Zakaria pointed to what Trump said during a recent press conference, when, after being told by reporters that there was no evidence to back up his claim, the president allegedly attempted to pawn his accusation off on the media.
