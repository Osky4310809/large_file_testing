Sophie Cruz (sometimes spelled Sofie) has very much been pushed into the spotlight and doesn’t seem to mind the public relations gig one bit. She’s kind of a pro at it. @womensmarch Sophie Cruz is our Activist of the Year for her advocacy for undocumented families. https://t.co/x4tHFDmUB1 pic.twitter.com/Y5ZrhTk1Vp \n— Define American (@DefineAmerican) January 21, 2017 Sophie Cruz is too young to vote, but she's out to #GetLoud for the health of her community! #Vota ! pic.twitter.com/APwbt23Ngt \n— California Endowment (@CalEndow) November 8, 2016 \nWe’ve gone over this before, but a quick refresher. At 5, Sophie made headlines as the girl who got past the barricades and/or broke through/breached/eluded security during the pope’s visit in 2015 to hand-deliver a plea for amnesty for her family. Even PBS eventually reported that the spontaneous encounter had been planned for a year by an activist group that “pulled off a similar public relations coup” in Rome a year earlier with a 10-year-old girl. Trending 'She seems really nuts': Ashley Judd goes unhinged against Trump at #WomensMarch [video] \nSince that encounter, Sophie has appeared in a video by FWD.us , an advocacy group backed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, visited the Supreme Court , and dropped in on President Obama for Cinco de Mayo (though her parents, both illegals, weren’t invited in). Joe Biden was even there to pinch those cheeks, because of course he was. Today, @POTUS and @VP met young activist Sophie Cruz at the White House #CincoDeMayo reception.

Sophie Cruz's immigration question about her parents wasn't asked at the debate, but she's not giving up https://t.co/VYE2f5Zr5P \nThis amazing Mexican-American girl is getting more political than ever ? \nShe’s 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T07:37:28.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
