(PTI) \nAbhishek Manu Singhvi’s remark that Manohar Parrikar is the chief minister for two days beginning this evening seems off the cuff. BJP already has already mustered the numbers and has presented affidavits on those to the Governor. Abhishekh Manu Singhvi was obviously reacting to the Supreme Court order of conducting a floor test on Thursday giving two days to prove the majority. Supreme Court had also paved the way for oath taking ceremony of Manohar Parrikkar this evening. This development came after the Congress moved the apex court challenging the scheduled swearing-in of Parrikar. \nDuring the hearing, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Congress, alleged that the BJP was indulging in horse-trading and violating the established constitutional practices. \nAlso watch: \nHe asserted that the Congress was not even consulted once on the formation of next government in the state. The Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) J.S. Khehar, observed that numbers should determine the single largest party in the state. The apex court further told the Congress that it should have gone to Goa Governor.It may be recalled that Governor Mridula Sinha had invited Parrikar to form the next government in the coastal state after he submitted a letter of support of 21 legislators. Senior advocate Harish Salve represented the Central Government during the hearing in the apex court, which ordered a floor test. \nThree MLAs of the Goa Forward Party, three of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and two Independents have pledged their support to Parrikar. The BJP, which won 13 seats in the 40-member Goa Assembly, managed to garner support from other parties and Independents to attain majority under Parrikar.
