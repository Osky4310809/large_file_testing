Some speculated that it was Samsung who was cleverly hoarding the chips exclusively for the Galaxy S8, but a report last week placed the blame on unsatisfactory yield rates for all 10nm chips from Samsung .\nThese types of reports are often left unsubstantiated because all parties involved tend to avoid making any official announcements about the issue. Neither Samsung nor Qualcomm publically announced exactly when their chips would be available for mass production and sale to other OEMs, and Samsung hadn’t previously announced exactly when the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ would be launched. However, a new rumor is starting to lend some credibility to the earlier report. The report states that the launch of the Galaxy S8/S8+ will be delayed by a week , and is now set for April 28th .\nThe rumor comes to us from Evan Blass (@evleaks) reporting at VentureBeat , and he had originally been told the latest Samsung flagships would be launched on April 21st (which was backed up by other reports as well). The Samsung Unpacked event in New York City, where Samsung will officially announce the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, is still on schedule for later this month, so there’s no need to worry about the official announcement. It’s just that the date in which Samsung had originally planned to make the device available for purchase is now rumored to be delayed a week.\nGranted, this delay might not have anything to do with that report we saw about the 10nm yield rates, and it could be caused by something else entirely. Still, these rumors do seem to be a bit more credible now.\nSource: VentureBeat ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:28:25.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
