You know, fans, if you're just seen with somebody, they think you're immediately, you gotta be in a relationship with them, which is not true. \n\"I hang out all the time with different people that I'm not dating, that I'm just friends with. I hang out with a lot of guys because I'm a total tomboy, so a lot of my friends end up being guys because a lot of girls are like kind of too girly for me sometimes.\" Actress Bella Thorne (Photo: Getty Images North America) Actress Bella Thorne of the television show 'Famous In Love' (Photo: Getty Images North America) \nAnd the 19-year-old actress also fumed about social media, which she believes is full of people who \"think they know what they're talking about\". \nShe added to People magazine: \"People take social media as such a big thing. And they all think they know what they're talking about. And they think they know your life and they get their friends to trash you.

So when you’re in a relationship with someone who doesn’t understand social media, it’s a really big f***ing challenge ... If you’re not willing to be down with that, I can’t change that about me. \n\"You think I want paparazzi following my every move? You think I want people trashing me on the Internet all the time, talking s**t about me? No! But that is my life, and if you’re dating me, you need to know that you have to take that on in a sense, too.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:53:11.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
