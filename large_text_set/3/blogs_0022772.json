The couple drew up a fortnightly schedule to split custody equally the morning they split up and have stuck to it ever since. \n“We are both theatre PRs and sometimes have to swap and change sessions to cover press night, for example,” she told The Independent. “An app like Google calendar gives us flexibility to reference and update on the hoof (we have a deal that the only person who updates it once a change is agreed is me so as not to confuse things). We colour code to make it super clear at a glance, it's pretty straightforward to do.” Who gets the pets when couples divorce? \nFraser-Cannon, who also communicates with her ex through WhatsApp when discussing pick-ups and drop-offs and sharing images, says she imagines co-parenting to be “nightmarish” without the help of their calendar app. \n“I would expect lots of crossed communication, potential for paper diaries or personal diaries not getting updated as hands were full at the point of agreed change for instance. Our child could easily end up not collected from nursery or other stressful situations,” she says. “Our current system gives us both the opportunity to live our own lives also, see friends, see shows, date etc. I really feel we have the best of both worlds and the calendar gives opportunity for that to run smoothly. There again we never did co-parenting without it.” \nKate Daly is another businessperson who branched into the world of apps following her own “traumatic” divorce, it launched just before Christmas and is now used by people in 23 countries.

It starts by users building a family profile and then creating a parenting plan. FindTheHome | Graphiq \n\n“We help them focus on what’s really important and start with the big questions like, ‘What do our kids need to thrive and be happy?” rather than, ‘When will I get to see my kids?’” \nThe app allows users to communicate with each other, share photos and upload important documents like schedules. \n“There are safeguarding statements and ground rules to protect vulnerable parents too and we are developing the next phase of functionality and constantly looking to enhance the content,” she says. “We have pre-populated the app with all the important decisions you need to make about parenting so all you have to do is click and swipe suggestions across.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:24:15.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
