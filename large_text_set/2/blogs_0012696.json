They are strong. Very strong. When I look at Ibra I think of Eric Cantona. Big personality. He can get mad in one second, say big things, and then, 'OK, I said it.'

And he scores. Goals, goals, goals. Lots of people said he would find it difficult in England but, already, 20 goals. \n\"He is a great professional. He sets an example. I think that's why they brought him to Manchester. Like Cantona. I have some friends in Paris and they told me all the time: 'If you give the ball here rather than there he will kill you.'\" \nIbrahimovic has been a key man for United as they bid to break into the top four of the Premier League.

I have to score 100 goals! The option is already fulfilled from my side. But there’s nothing done yet. We’ll wait and see. Let’s see what happens.” \nIbrahimovic has scored 20 times for United this season, with 15 of those goals coming in the Premier League.
