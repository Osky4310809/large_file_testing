Rooney has started only four league games since November for new United boss Jose Mourinho (Photo: Getty) \n“He would come over here and, I’m hoping, would be energised to play and wouldn’t be here just for the party or the money. \n“It’s a tough league now. It used to be where some of these guys could come over here and think, ‘I’m just going to skate through’. I think there’s been plenty of examples where it’s been proven that you can’t do that. \n\"You need to be fit, you need to be focused and you need to take it seriously or you’re going to embarrass yourself. \n“He would need to be motivated to come over here and be successful like some of the other guys have been. David Beckham was the prime example — he wanted to win here.” \nCanetti admits Rooney will never have the impact Beckham did: “I’m not sure if he’s as big a brand, just because Beckham was so pop culture. Beckham wasn't just a PR move — he was an MLS champion twice in six years at LA Galaxy (Photo: Getty) \n“From a football perspective, there will be the hard-core fans that say ‘Wow, Wayne Rooney!’ but with David Beckham, you don’t need to be a football fan to know who he is and what he represents.” \nAnd Canetti says if Rooney is after wages similar to what he's on at Old Trafford he should look elsewhere, because MLS wants serious players not money-grabbers. \n“We need to improve the talent and invest across the board instead of one player,” he said. \nAnd he also warned anyone hoping to end their playing days in the States that it can be a tough experience. \nCanetti believes former England skipper Steve Gerrard was surprised by what he found during his 18 months in MLS with LA Galaxy. Gerrard found the long-distance travel and wildly varying climates of MLS gruelling (Photo: Getty) \nHe said of the legendary Liverpool midfield, who made the move at age 35: “I don’t think it was a question of his focus or commitment. I think he found the league to be more challenging that he expected. \n“He plays a very demanding position. When he came here to play us, it was 100 degrees and 90 per cent humidity. He found the elements to be challenging. \n“In some cases, you have to come to Houston where it’s 100 degrees. \n“You go to Salt Lake or Colorado where you’re at altitude and you have to deal with that, or you go to Toronto or Montreal where it’s cold, or you go to Seattle or Portland or New England where you’re playing on artificial turf.\" poll loading Where will Rooney go after Man United? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:52:33.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
