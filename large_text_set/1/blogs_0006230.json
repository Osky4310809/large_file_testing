Wrong. The most common name in the Bollywood and television worlds is undisputedly Karan. That name has some serious star power too (some, we said, because some Karan's are ... we won't go there). Here we go! \n1. Karan Johar: Director, producer and Godfather of star kids. \n2. Karan Singh Grover: Actor and third time lucky husband of Bipasha Basu. \n3. Karanvir Bohra: Actor, who is currently seen in Naagin 2 . \n4. Karan Wahi: Actor and part-time comedian on Comedy Night Bachao . \n5. Karan Kundra: Actor and boyfriend of Anusha Dandekar. \n6. Karan Tacker: Actor, well known for his serial Ek Hazaaron Mein Meri Behna Hai . \n7. Karan Sharma: Actor, who has the most common name and surname ever. \n8. Karan Patel: Actor, known for always being grumpy. \n9. Karan Mehra: Actor, Bigg Boss 10 contestant. \n10. Karan Mehra: Not so famous actor. \n11.
