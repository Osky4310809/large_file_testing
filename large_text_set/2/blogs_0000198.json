Like, whoa. How amazing is that?! What makes Sheryl Sandberg’s Planned Parenthood donation such a big deal is that Paul Ryan and the Republican party have promised to entirely defund Planned Parenthood , which would be hugely devastating for many people who rely on it for so many crucial health services.\nSince going to Planned Parenthood is how many people get necessary healthcare, it’s so important that they continue to get donations that allow them to carry out their important work.\nWe’re so relieved when people like Sheryl Sandberg do the incredibly important work of making sure these resources stay alive! \nHonestly, all we can say is TG for this awesome woman.\nIn a Facebook post, Sheryl Sandberg explained why she donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood, writing, “I started my career working at the World Bank on health care in India. I saw firsthand how clinics funded by foreign aid are often the only source of health care for women. When women are given even the most basic health care information and services, they live longer, healthier lives — and they give birth to children who live longer, healthier lives… The best way to prevent abortion is through more family planning services, not fewer… Women’s rights are human rights — and there is no more basic right than health care. Women around the world deserve our support.” Just, like, yes. We’re so thrilled about this, and we hope people continue to donate to Planned Parenthood . We don’t want to live in a world without it, and we know we’re not the only ones.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:21:47.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
