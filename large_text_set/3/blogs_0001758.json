Getting elected mayor of Baltimore was lovely, but now comes the hard sweat of governing and leading. And her first big test is at hand: a $130 million budget gap in the city schools , and the threatened layoff of teachers. \nThe last thing Baltimore needs is any... (Dan Rodricks) \nSchreiner, a 59-year-old retired longshoreman, has owned the row of garages along Marshall Street for 25 years, and Smith, 63, a semi-retired contractor, has rented one of them for 15. Smith often parks his pickup truck in a vacant lot next to the garage and works inside. He's been feeding pigeons for years. \n\"Sometimes,\" says Smith, \"the pigeons come to me and they'll have wire on their feet, or fishing line, and I'll remove it for them.\" One of the pigeons had a mangled toe, requiring amputation; Smith conducted the minor surgery and treated the toe with Neosporin. As far as he knows, the bird survived. \n\"Carl is the pigeon whisperer,\" says Jim Pumphrey, who lives nearby, on Light Street. \nPigeons, wild and domesticated, are part of city life, and in South Baltimore there is a long history of residents keeping pigeons, training them and racing them over long distances. The South Baltimore Pigeon Fanciers Social Club has been around for at least 50 years. \n\"These pigeons here now are descendants of the pigeons that people used to keep in coops up and down Marshall Street,\" says Pumphrey, a 59-year-old longshoreman who has lived in South Baltimore all his life. \nA cease-and-desist letter from Kimberly Manuelides, an attorney representing the owner of 2 East Wells, arrived at Smith's apartment in South Baltimore last June. It blamed him for a nuisance by feeding and attracting pigeons to Marshall Street. The letter warned him of legal action if he did not stop. \nNow legal action has come against both Schreiner and Smith, and they have retained Baltimore attorneys Barry Glazer and Jonathan Saltzman. They've challenged the claims against their clients, saying the owner of 2 East Wells had other remedies, such as registering a complaint with health authorities, before filing suit. They seek $75,000 from Wells LLC in a counter-suit that claims Schreiner and Smith have been subjected to an \"improper, frivolous and baseless\" legal action. They called the lawsuit \"malicious,\" too. \nToo bad, all of it: litigation from the push-and-shove of the new Baltimore meeting the old one. \nSmith still feeds the pigeons, but he does so now behind Schreiner's garage, when no one's looking. \"I can't help myself,\" he says. \"I do it secretly.\" And he's not the only pigeon feeder in the neighborhood, he says. Four or five neighbors also put out food for the birds. \nWhich raises, I should think, a significant challenge for plaintiff: Tracing excrement from the pigeons Carl Smith feeds to the balconies on 2 East Wells. As Smith says, \"I have no control over where the pigeons poop.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:09:06.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
