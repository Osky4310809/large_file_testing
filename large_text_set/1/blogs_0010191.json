A lot of questions remain, but the company released the first game trailers. And boy do they look good. Watch the first set here. 1/11 Super Mario Odyssey \nIt’s Mario meets Crazy Taxi and Spider-Man in Super Mario Odyssey. In the Switch’s premiere launch title, Mario looks to explore a huge variety of worlds — from a New York City-type area to castles to, yes, even a water world. 2/11 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild \nThis epic Nintendo franchise has never looked better. The latest title looks to tell a historical tale while still following the adventures of Link and Zelda. 3/11 1-2 Switch \nThe Switch has two controllers. And in 1-2 Switch, players use those controllers to battle in minigames. This looks like Wii Sports, but for the latest system. 4/11 ARMS \nARMS appears to be Punch-Out with Street Fighter’s Dhalsim signature long arms. Battle other players with cartoon-ish characters using the Switch’s motion controllers. Advertisement 5/11 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe \nIt’s Mario Kart! The latest edition looks to be an updated version of the Wii U’s title. There’s new maps, characters and carts. But overall, the gameplay and mechanics appears to be carried over from the last game. And that’s fine. Mario Kart 8 is a fantastic title. 6/11 Splatoon 2 \nSplatoon was a breakout hit for the Wii U. The Switch’s title doesn’t appear to be much different from the original though it’s probably been updated to support the Switch’s motion controllers. 7/11 Fire Emblem Warriors \nThis is the game Nintendo diehards have been waiting to get. Yet the trailer leaves a lot of questions. There’s old symbols and unidentified objects. The game isn’t scheduled for release until 2017’s Holiday season, though. Expect to see more of this at E3 2017 this spring 8/11 Xenoblade Chronicles 2 \nXenoblade is Nintendo’s Final Fantasy. And for many players, it’s better. This latest version builds on the story and looks good doing it. It will be interesting to see if the game incorporate’s the Switch’s motion controller. Advertisement 9/11 Sonic Mania \nSonic! Sonic is back. And not that different from the originals. Sonic Mania isn’t a reboot. It’s a remake of previous titles, updated with new levels and mechanics. Generation Xers. This one is for you. 10/11 Super Bomberman R \nSuper Bomberman was one of the first party games and the latest version looks to have all the furious action as the original — just with modern graphics. Hopefully it’s as hard as the original, too. 11/11 Puyo Puyo Tetris \nPuyo Puyo Tetris lets multiple people compete at the classic puzzle game on the same screen. And there looks to be a Dr. Mario-type game mode too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T16:43:26.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
