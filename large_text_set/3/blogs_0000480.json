Philstar.com/Artemio Dumlao, File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - Despite his objections to some of its provisions, President Rodrigo Duterte has signed the historic Paris climate deal calling for the reduction of carbon emissions that have been linked to natural disasters. \nMalacañang submitted the agreement to the Senate for ratification last February 28, documents furnished to the media showed on Wednesday. \n\"After examining the text thereof, I find it advisable to accede to the Paris Agreement and seek the Senate's concurrence thereto,\" the president said in a letter to the Senate. \nThe climate agreement has to be ratified by the Senate before it becomes binding. \nClimate change, which has been linked to natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, has been blamed on carbon emissions caused by human activities. \nIn 2015, members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change including the Philippines crafted the Paris agreement, which aims to limit the increase in the global average temperature to “well below” two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Leaders of the member countries have also vowed step up measures to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.   \nDeveloped countries are required to provide financial support to developing countries’ mitigation and adaptation efforts. \nThe deal also requires signatories to set carbon emission targets but is silent on what would happen to parties who would fail to meet them. While not a major emitter, the Philippines promised to reduce carbon emissions by 70 percent by 2030. \nScience Secretary Fortunato dela Peña believes the Philippines’ commitment to reduce its carbon emissions by 70 percent is doable. \n“Whatever difficulties we may encounter, we are bound to extend our support to that so I think it is doable if all sectors we’ll cooperate” dela Peña said. \n“With the approval, then we have to really focus our programs on how to meet the commitment of the Philippines,” he added. \nThe science chief said his agency would intensify research on renewable energy, energy conservation, and other areas that would enable the Philippines to address the impact of climate change. \n“We have to improve our programs, for example in our assistance to small scale enterprises. We enable them to acquire equipment for production. Now we are opening the system to companies who want to improve, to change, let’s say from traditional energy source to renewable,” dela Peña said. \nDuterte previously rejected the climate deal, calling it a “stupid” and “unfair” agreement that can limit the industrialization of developing countries like the Philippines. \nThe president noted that the agreement did not enumerate sanctions for parties that failed comply with their obligations. \n“If there is no sanction and you are asking somebody to do something or not to do something, and there is no sanction or punishment or whatever, then it’s nothing,” Duterte said in a speech last November. \nIn the same speech, Duterte questioned the funding source for countries vulnerable to the impact of climate change \n“There would be a commonality of funds running P2 billion or say $200 billion. Who is going to give it? It was not stated there (in the agreement),” the president said. \n“What kind of fool would give $200 billion? It’s easy to say there are a lot who can give,” the Philippine leader said. \nDuterte eventually agreed to ratify the agreement after some discussions with Cabinet members.
