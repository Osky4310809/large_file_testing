The club are regressing under Wenger as six losses in their last nine matches in all competitions show. Yet he looks to be in control of his own destiny, with the club's hierarchy displaying little evidence of leadership even despite growing vitriol from fans . The Gunners head into Sunday's home match against Manchester City with confidence in tatters following a damaging 3-1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion before the international break. They also lost goalkeeper Petr Cech to injury during the result . \nCity boss Pep Guardiola should be licking his lips at the prospect of a trip to Emirates -- imagine the damaging domino effect caused by an early goal from the visitors. Guardiola will know how Wenger will set up his side because that barely changes. Therein lies one of the many problems Arsenal endure under Wenger, an innovator who stopped innovating. The reverse of this fixture in December saw the Gunners take the lead but then retreat into their shells. In the second half, City completed their turnaround and Wenger remained passive. He is losing matches and seems to have lost his players. \nA long and painful goodbye looks set to continue against City. \nCould Everton make a late top-four push with Merseyside derby victory? \nWin this Merseyside derby and Everton go within three points of rivals Liverpool, who sit fourth. That's some significant motivation right there, before we even mention local pride. Ronald Koeman is enjoying an impressive debut season in charge since he took over from Roberto Martinez. His side are level on points with fifth-placed Arsenal, and although the Gunners boast two games in hand, do not rule out Everton finishing above them come the end of the campaign. They could yet make a late push for Champions League qualification. \nKoeman's quest for three points was boosted with the news that the hard-running Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana is set to miss out through injury , while key duo Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino are unlikely to be at their freshest for the Saturday lunchtime kickoff following Brazil duty. And while Everton right-back Seamus Coleman's broken leg is a crushing blow , Koeman can console himself in the marvellous Romelu Lukaku staying injury-free. \nHe'll need his prolific Belgian to be in decisive form at the weekend -- Everton have one just once at Anfield since 1999. Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling were on the scoresheet in Man City's last fixture against Arsenal. \nAre goal-shy Middlesbrough doomed even after Aitor Karanka's exit? \nMiddlesbrough scored their first Premier League goal since Jan. 31 in their 3-1 loss to Manchester United , but that was at the expense of defending with some nous. The frankly tedious tactics of manager Aitor Karanka might be gone, but head coach Steve Agnew faces a daunting task in saving the club from relegation. Five points separate the second-from-bottom side from safety, although they do have a game in hand. \nGoals have been the issue, with just 20 managed in 28 top flight matches this season. Only one Boro player, Alvaro Negredo (six), has scored more than four league goals this term. Agnew wants his players to replicate the \"commitment and that sort of intensity,\" from the United loss into the remainder of the campaign. Boro need more than effort, though. They must also show penetration, starting at Swansea on Sunday. \nWill clinical Jermain Defoe be enough for Sunderland to survive? \nDavid Moyes' Sunderland look doomed. Such a bleak outlook has been predicted in many a recent season, only for them to defy their critics with a late and unlikely surge. This time around, though, the writing looks to be on the wall for the club, whose place in the Premier League looks set to be taken by North East rivals Newcastle United . \nSunderland are rooted to the bottom of the table, seven points below 17th-placed Swansea and have 10 matches to preserve their top-flight status. The crumb of comfort for Moyes amid a desperate situation is striker Defoe. The 34-year-old rolled back the years with a goal for England last Sunday and has 14 Premier League strikes to his name this season. Without Defoe, Sunderland would be down already. Next up is a trip to Watford, who in 14th are not out of the woods just yet. \nWill Slaven Bilic be in charge of West Ham United next season? \nWest Ham United have won two of their last eight Premier League fixtures. Both of those victories came away from home. With the 16th-worst home record in the division this season, their London Stadium has been anything but home sweet home. At least their next two matches come on the road, with Hull City on Saturday and then Arsenal next Wednesday. The Hammers have a nine-point cushion between themselves and the drop zone, so seemingly have just enough to stave off dropping to the Championship. But question marks remain over manager Bilic's future, particularly after the high of finishing seventh last season. When you have joint chairman David Sullivan apologising following a loss , alarm bells are ringing. \nJames Dall is an associate editor at ESPN FC.
