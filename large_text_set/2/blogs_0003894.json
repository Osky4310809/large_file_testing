Advertisement \nThis video from AsapSCIENCE explores the immediate and longterm affects of quitting smoking. Just twenty minutes after you stop smoking, your blood pressure and heart rate should return to normal levels as nicotine causes blood vessels to narrow.

Around that time your nicotine cravings will also peak. Of course, in the longterm, the benefits of quitting smoking are numerous and substantial. It’s hard for everyone to quit—especially when anything that assuages your daily stress feels essential—but it’s an important reminder to stop when you can.
