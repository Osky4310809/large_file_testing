The other remaining market share—all 0.4 percentage points of it—is divided between Windows, BlackBerry, and operating systems designated as “other.” \nReally, the stranglehold Android and iOS has on the mobile market isn’t surprising. What is surprising is people still continue to opt for BlackBerry and Windows devices; even the latest BlackBerry smartphones run Android, which should tell you all you need to know. \nIn total, 431 million smartphones were sold last quarter, a whopping 352 million of which ran Android, giving Google’s OS an 81.7 percent hold of the market. Apple has a decidedly smaller slice of the pie, but still managed to snag 17.9 percent, with the company selling a record number of iPhones over the busy holiday period. \nAlthough over 200,000 BlackBerry devices were sold during Q4 of 2016, the firm still had a 0.0 percent market share. Microsoft’s mobile stake stands at 0.3 percent, selling just over 1 million new units during the previous quarter. gallery 21 Mobile is still growing \nAs Gartner’s data shows, the mobile market is still growing. During the same quarter in 2015, approximately 403 million smartphones were sold around the world, compared to the 431 million in Q4 of 2016. Both Android and iOS are growing, too, while the rest of the market continues to shrink. \nGartner notes Samsung’s star has begun to dim, likely due to last year’s unfortunate Galaxy Note 7 debacle. Not to mention, the Korean company is facing even fiercer competition in the Android market, along with the rise of Apple, which is currently the globe’s top vendor (though not by much). \nWith exciting new mobile technology on the horizon, it’ll be a competitive year among OEMs, especially between Samsung and Apple. Which, if you think about it, ultimately benefits consumers.
