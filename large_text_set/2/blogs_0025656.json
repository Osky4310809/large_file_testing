This simple exercise, when used with diligent note taking, can help you retain more of everything you read. \nOn his blog, James Clear talks about the importance of taking notes while you read, as well as making those notes organized and searchable. But Clear also recommends you practice a summarizing exercise every time you finish a book. It’s simple: as soon as you finish a book, try to sum up everything you’ve read in three sentences. The practice forces you to go back over your notes and pull what was really important about the book. Now, in the future, you don’t have to read the book again to regain any lost knowledge. You can simply review your notes and read your summary to unlock all of that blocked off knowledge. This can be used for anything you read too, not just books. So do a little writing to improve your reading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:12:04.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
