We talk a lot about the Asian Cup and you look at the starting eleven and the squad and where they were in their careers then and where they are now there hasn’t been a hell of a lot of progress. \n“That’s a little bit alarming for me. Back then the idea was to introduce a whole lot of players and hopefully by this time at a critical time of a World Cup cycle they’re all playing at a higher level, well we haven’t got many of those.” \nThe hype around Aaron Mooy’s Championship performances and Trent Sainsbury’s move to Inter Milan in Italy are a solid indicator over the public’s desire to see Australians back at the top level. \nIndeed, there is a school of thought that the Socceroos have overachieved in recent years given the quality of clubs being represented in XI. But, even though they have remained a bright beacon at a time younger national sides have given many indigestion over the future health of the side, there is a little anxiety about the fixture list ahead. \nHere’s a look at then, and now, the Socceroos from the Asian Cup, where they are now, and then, the others in Europe now who are providing an alternative. The Socceroos win the Asian Cup.

Untimely njury, a coaching merry-go-round and deep goalkeeping stocks meant Ryan had to be patient, but he maintained his standards with magnificent displays for his country. Back in Belgium, as a No.1, he is sure to be the first man picked for the Roos over the coming months despite Mitch Langerak’s form. \nIVAN FRANJIC - Torpedo Moscow to Melbourne City \nFranjic is the prototype of what Postecoglou wants from his right backs, so it wouldn’t surprise to see the City right back thrust back into the mix next week now that he is back to something near full fitness for Melbourne City. Franjic was a key cog for Postecoglou when he took over, but injury and an unstable club situation in Russia was the last thing he needed when his career looked like taking off.

The 25-year-old was offered an irresistible deal to move to China, but, new rules on imports in the CSL saw his move take a surprise turn in January that will hopefully benefit his football in the long run. \nMATTHEW SPIRANOVIC - Western Sydney to Hangzhou \nWhen Postecoglou issues an ultimatum like this, you feel he could be talking directly to the 28-year-old, whose club was relegated last season. It’s hard to be critical of someone offered lucrative money that can set him up for life, but there’s no doubt it is a disappointment for football reasons because, in theory, one of the most talented defenders Australia has produced was at the heart of Postecoglou’s plans long term plans - injury permitting. Whether that remains will be interesting, and depend a lot on what other contenders do. Is second division China the forum to prepare for Neymar, Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil etc? Coach Ange Postecoglou. Source: News Corp Australia \nJASON DAVIDSON - West Bromwich to Huddersfield Town to Groningen \nThe left-back looked to have the inside running on the position around the World Cup, before going head-to-head with Aziz Behich. But his career stalled at WBA in the Premier League and Postecoglou has seen fit to experiment with youngsters Alex Gersbach and Brad Smith since then, despite Davidson playing regularly in the Championship last season. \nMARK MILLIGAN - Melbourne Victory to Baniyas \nPostecoglou loves Milligan, despite the versatile veteran plying his trade in the Middle East. He has done brilliantly thus far to maintain his levels since leaving the A-League, but wonder if he was playing at a higher level, may he have usurped his skipper in the midfield pecking order? \nMILE JEDINAK - Crystal Palace to Aston Villa \nJedinak returned from the highs of the Asian Cup to Alan Pardew’s frosty reception at Crystal Palace, and from that moment on, his position at Selhurst Park was not as safe as someone with his revered status would have expected. He started slowly after dropping down a division, but now that he has acclimatised, Villa fans are starting to appreciate the industry and steel he brings. Mile Jedinak of Aston Villa.

Winning the Best Player of the tournament prize, the then Swindon Town (English League One) midfielder went on to earn a Ballon d’Or nomination which made headlines around the world. \nOff the back of his successful tournament, Luongo went on to move to Championship side QPR in the off-season of 2015, turning down offers from EPL teams. Since then, his upwards trajectory has stalled, with QPR currently struggling towards the bottom of the ladder. \nROBBIE KRUSE - Bayer Leverkusen to Liaoning Whowin \nWhere would Robbie Kruse’s career have taken him if not for his injury in the Asian Cup final? Having recovered from the knee injury that saw him miss the 2014 World Cup, Kruse then shone in front of home fans before suffering a serious ankle injury in tragic circumstances. \nSince then, he’s found it tough, unable to break into the Bayer Leverkusen first team before agreeing to join the Chinese Super League in a big-money move to Liaoning Whowin. Postecoglou has kept the faith with the talented winger for now. Will that continue? \nMATHEW LECKIE — Ingolstadt \nMathew Leckie struggles in front of goal for both club and country, despite being a regular for both the Socceroos and FC Ingolstadt. A favourite of Postecoglou, who values his high intensity style and ability to press, Leckie has remained with Ingolstadt after helping them to promotion to the Bundesliga in 2014. \nHaving suffered a spell out of the side after being on the receiving end of two red cards in Germany this season, time is running out for the 26-year-old to fulfil his potential. \nTIM CAHILL — New York Red Bulls to Shenhua to Hangzhou to Melbourne City \nIt was Tim Cahill’s impressive performances at the Asian Cup, and against China in particular, that prompted his move to the Chinese Super League with Shanghai Shenhua from the MLS. \nGiven the tempo of the league and what is required to compete on the international stage, that was a backwards move but Cahill did well to maintain his physical level and prolong his incredible career. One season at Shanghai and a stint with Chinese strugglers Hangzhou Greentown later, Cahill is back in Australia with Melbourne City where he continues to pop up with crucial goals. \nHe remains vital to the Socceroos.

That’s a timely return from injury for the Socceroos, and Juric’s form prior saw him reject a deadline day move to Championship side Reading. \nHe shapes as a crucial squad member given depth isn’t great up top. \nJAMES TROISI — Zulte Waregem to Ittihad to Liaoning to Melbourne Victory \nWhat a busy two years it has been for James Troisi, who ventured into the football wilderness before reminding everyone of his immense abilities with Melbourne Victory this season. Having scored that winning goal in the final, Troisi had been in good form in Belgium with Zulte Waregem, on loan from Atalanta. \nThen, with his contract up, Troisi opted for failed stints in Saudi Arabia (Ittihad) and China (Liaoning) before coming back to dominate the A-League once he recovered from an early shoulder injury. \nHis form this season could be crucial for Australia, given Rogic’s absence.

(on loan from Valencia). \nGames played in 2016/17: 8. \nBack playing regularly after returning to Belgium having lost his spot in the Valencia team in August. It was a move that had to happen for the former Central Coast stopper with Mitch Langerak breathing down his neck for the Socceroos No.1 jersey. Has tasted defeat just once in six matches with Genk. \nMitch Langerak - VFB Stuttgart. \nGames played: 24. \nHis move from Borussia Dortmund in June has paid off with the former Melbourne Victory custodian an ever-present for the Bundesliga 2 leaders who look well set for an instant return to the top flight. Langerak has conceded just 23 goals and been a key player this season for one of the sleeping giants of German football. \nAdam Federici - Bournemouth. \nGames played: 5 \nVery much the second-choice goalkeeper behind Artur Boric at the Goldsands Stadium and has featured mostly in cup competitions. Acquitted himself well in his two EPL appearances, helping the Cherries to a 1-0 win over Stoke before losing 3-1 at Arsenal in November. \nDefenders \nBrad Smith - Bournemouth. \nGames played: 8. Goals: 0 \nIt hasn’t really worked out for Smith since departing Liverpool in search of regular football last July. The full back has struggled to break into the Bournemouth side, making only three EPL starts - and tasting defeat in all of them. His last appearance was as a substitute in a 6-3 defeat at Everton on February 4. \nTrent Sainsbury - Inter Milan (on loan from Jiangsu Suning) \nGames played: 28 Goals 0 \nSecured a dream move to Italian giants Inter Milan on January 31 in a surprise loan switch from the Chinese Super League outfit. Has been an unused substitute four times since joining The Nerazzurri, but could be pushing for his debut this weekend following Inter’s dismal 3-1 home defeat by Roma last Sunday. A post shared by Trent Sainsbury (@trentsainsbury) on Mar 1, 2017 at 10:36am PST \nBailey Wright - Bristol City. \nGames played: 33. Goals: 0 \nEnded his long association with Preston North End for their Championship rivals during the January transfer window and is now embroiled in a relegation scrap. Despite the much-heralded signing of the rugged centre-half, City have lost 11 of their last 14 matches and only out of the bottom three on goal difference. \nAlex Gerbasch - Rosenborg. \nGames played 0. Goals 0 \nAfter helping the Norwegian giants win the Tippeligaen in his first season after signing from Sydney FC, the talented 19-year-old left-back will kick off his new campaign on April 2. \nMidfielders \nJames Jeggo - Sturm Graz. \nGames played: 22. Goals: 0 \nJeggo has settled in well in the heart of the Sturm midfield since joining from Adelaide United and missed just one game all season for a side that sits in fourth spot in the Austrian Bundesliga. Yet to find the net but leads the league in bookings with eight yellow cards to his name. \nAaron Mooy - Huddersfield Town (on loan from Man City). \nGames played: 35. Goals: 2 \nHas been a revelation for Huddersfield, who are third in Championship table and firmly in the hunt to return to the top flight for the first time since 1972. Although officially a Manchester City player, Mooy’s loan spell with the Terriers has caught the attention of other EPL clubs with Middlesbrough and West Brom enquiring about his availability. Seems inevitable he will playing at a higher level next season, less than a year after leaving the A-League. Mooy's pinpoint assist \nMassimo Luongo - QPR. \nGames played: 27 Goals: 0 \nWas rewarded with a new two-year contract extension last month in what has been a rebuilding season for the west London club. Has been converted from an all-out attacking midfielder into a more defensive-minded role and has risen to the challenge well. Still waiting to score his first goal in the English Championship. \nJackson Irvine - Burton Albion. \nGames played: 32. Goals: 8 \nHas enjoyed a magnificent season for the Championship’s smallest team, with his goals and performances giving the Brewers a fighting chance of avoiding an immediate return to League One. Handed the captain’s armband and recently offered a new contract. However, he’s unlikely to be at the Pirelli Stadium next year with Derby, Birmingham City and Newcastle all reported to be keen to sign the 23-year-old. \nMile Jedinak - Aston Villa. \nGames played: 27. Goals: 0 Jedinak’s exit from Crystal Palace for Aston Villa was greeted with despair by Eagles fans, but it hasn’t been sweet sailing for the Socceroos skipper at his new club. His absence with a groin injury in January coincided with a run of five straight losses for the Villains to suck them into a relegation scrap. His recent return helped secure crucial wins over Derby and Bristol City. \nCraig Goodwin - Sparta Rotterdam. \nGames played: 19. Goals: 3 After an excellent start to life in the Dutch Eredivisie with three goals in his first 11 games, the former Adelaide United and Newcastle Jets wideman has found himself out of the picture and not started a game since December. Amini boosts Socceroos hopes \nTom Rogic - Celtic. \nGames played: 27. Goals 10 \nA serious ankle injury looks likely to keep Rogic out of the Iraq and the UAE matches. The talented striker, who has been sidelined since mid-December, had been enjoying an outstanding season with the runaway Scottish league leaders and is constantly linked with a move to Arsenal \nStrikers \nTomi Juric - FC Luzern. \nGames played: 18. Goals 4 \nRecently returned to action following the knee injury that saw him miss November’s World Cup qualifier against Thailand. Juric was brought back slowly by the Swiss club’s coach Markus Babbel who used him off the bench for two games before restoring the former Western Sydney front man to the starting line-up in last weekend’s 3-1 defeat by FC Basel. \nMathew Leckie - Ingolstad t \nGames played 23. Goals: 0 \nIt’s been a disappointing season for Leckie, who has more red cards than goals to his name and is playing in a relegation-threatened side who sit four points from safety at the foot of the Bundesliga table. The powerful winger is currently midway through a two-match ban after being sent off for a second time against Eintracht Frankfurt. \n- additional reporting: Ian McCullough, AAP View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
