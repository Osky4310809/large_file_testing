I remember we had all the songs and Lars said, 'They want us to record one more, they need one more for the album.' \n\"I was like, 'You didn't tell me that...' So we had to write and it was really last-minute. So 'Escape' was one of those songs that was written in the studio.\" \nFeaturing a distinctively simpler structure and a catchier chorus than typical 'Tallica tunes from that era, \"Escape\" wasn't exactly a favorite for the band and it took them quite a long time to perform it live for the first time - over 10,000 days. \nThe album was originally released on July 27, 1984, while the tune's live premiere took place on June 23, 2012 at the group's Orion Music + More festival. \n\"The song that we never wanted to play live, ever, is now on the setlist,\" James said before kicking it off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:41:57.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
