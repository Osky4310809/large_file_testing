The Ducks aren't exactly a household name outside Pac-12 country (and maybe inside), with their garish uniforms, bizarre home-court design and mascot that's BFF with Mickey Mouse. So, with Oregon in the Elite Eight, here are eight things to know about the most colorful basketball team in the country. Jay Biggerstaff Jay Biggerstaff-USA TODAY Sports 1 \nRemember how your mother used to tell you not to stare at the sun because it might make you go blind? Oregon's neon yellow uniforms, which look like they were made by putting Big Bird on Mercury, might do the same. For years, the home teams in the NCAA tournament (aka the better-seeded team) would wear white jerseys while the \"road\" teams wore colored kits. But in recent years, as uniform design have become marketing opportunities for Nike and adidas and color palettes have trended toward Times Square, teams have started to wear soft color (e.g. Oregon's yelow) on hard color (e.g. Michigan's deep blues). It's a nice contrast, provided you're wearing sunglasses and don't have retinal problems. Denny Medley Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports 2 \nDillon Brooks, Oregon's top player, was brilliant in the first three rounds of last year's tournament, dropping 25 in a second-round win over St. Joe's and 22 in the team's \"upset\" of Duke in the Sweet 16. (Oregon was a No. 1 seed and Duke was a No. 4 but Duke's always the favorite, unless it is playing South Carolina in South Carolina, which is evidently that's too much for the team that collects McDonald's All-Americans like your grandma does state quarters.) But Brooks gained the most notoriety after the game, when Mike Krzyzewski, always classy in victory, chastised Brooks for taking a late 3-pointer with the game in hand. Coach K denied it at first but later apologized for it. Brooks should have tripped somebody and then I'm assuming Krzyzewski would have let it slide. Anyway, Brooks said the attention affected him and he had as many turnovers as field goals in a brutal game that ended up as 12-point Elite Eight loss to Oklahoma. The Sooners went on to lose in the Final Four by 44 points. Denny Medley Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports 3 \nTyler Dorsey, known to teammates as \"Mr. March,\" scored 20 points, including the go-ahead layup, Thursday. It's his sixth-straight game with 20+ points. The performances and Dorsey and Brooks are more impressive when you remember that Chris Boucher, the team's shot-blocking extraordinaire and one of the most efficient players in the country (even off the bench), was lost for the year with a torn ACL suffered in the Pac-12 semifinals.

But the court, hindered by restrictions on how busy a court can be, looks more like a bar shuffleboard table where all the sand has been pushed away from the center. 5 \nSpeaking of that national championship, the 1939 title came in the first NCAA tournament. Back then, Oregon was called the Webfoots, every player on the roster was from Oregon or Washington and only one player was taller than 6-foot-4. There were only eight teams in the tournament field and Oregon won their games by 15, 18 and 13 points despite the low-scoring pre-shot-clock era. Teams scored an average of 45 points per game, yet all seven were decided by double-digit points. How big was the win? When Oregon won, it earned a four-paragraph write-up in the New York Times , buried under a lede story about Columbia crew and given less play than Long Island University, which had won the NIT days earlier, accepting their title trophy. Suffice it to say, there was no One Shining Moment. Oregon hasn't been to a Final Four since and, before Thursday, hadn't defeated a Big Ten team in the tourney since that '39 championship over Ohio State. Denny Medley Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports 6 \nCoach Dana Altman was an Eagle Scout. He's one of five coaches with 20 consecutive winning seasons. Altman's last losing season came in his second year at Creighton, where he spent 16 seasons and made seven NCAA tournaments. The coach famously accepted a head coaching job at Arkansas in 2007, uncomfortably stood at an introductory press conference, and then quit a day later, a 24-hour Belichickian coaching stint. He went back to Creighton, with its $200 million arena (The House That Dana Built) and left three years later when that Nike money and backing came beckoning. Though the regional final in Kansas City will be a virtual home game for the Jayhawks, it'll be a home game for Altman of sorts. He spent his childhood and almost all of his 26-year coaching career in the area (before he left for Oregon). Denny Medley Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports 7 \nThe Ducks may have lost to Georgetown and Colorado this year, but the team has a school-record 32 wins, had a 17-game winning streak and has won 29 of 32 entering Saturday's showdown. But there's other history with which to deal: Oregon has never won an Elite Eight game. (Remember, in 1939 the \"Elite Eight\" was just the \"first round.\") The Ducks are 0-4 lifetime in the round, losing to Kansas in 2002, Florida in 2007, Louisville in 2013 and Oklahoma last year. Kansas, of course, will be Oregon's opponent in the Midwest regional final on Saturday. Kelley L Cox Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports 8 \nIf Oregon's mascot looks familiar it's because he is. It's Donald Duck. Basically. When the team first came up with the idea for a mascot, the school's athletic director made a deal with his buddy Walt Disney, who said the team could use Donald Duck as long as it was in good taste. Tweaks have been made over the years, an actual deal with Disney had to be signed after Walt died in 1966 (Oregon proved the verbal agreement by producing a picture of Walt in a Ducks letterman's jacket), but the mascot is called Donald and doesn't wear pants, so you do the math.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:03:27.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
