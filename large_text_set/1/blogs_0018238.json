Boro may soon have a vacancy for an attacking midfielder with Ramirez unsettled (Photo: Getty) \nMiddlesbrough’s quest for a new attacking midfielder could grow in the coming weeks, with the news Gaston Ramirez has told the club he wants to leave. \nThe Uruguayan arrived in the summer on a free transfer from Southampton after starring for the Teessiders on loan in last season's Championship promotion campaign, but he is unhappy at being played out of position. \nSunday Mirror Sport understands Leicester and Bournemouth have already shown an interest in taking the 26-year-old — should boss Aitor Karanka make him available.
