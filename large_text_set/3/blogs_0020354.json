And now, Ryan Gosling shared his thoughts on the Best Picture flub .\nIn case you somehow missed it (because maybe you live under a rock, and the rock’s wifi has been down), this was the year that it was mistakenly announced that La La Land landed the Oscar for Best Picture, when in reality, Moonlight had actually won.\nA lot happened on stage during the ensuing confusing moments (thankfully, the much-deserving Moonlight crew was able to take the stage and have their rightful moment in the spotlight). But one of the most viral-worthy details was Ryan Gosling’s completely bemused reaction . While everyone else looked stunned, he looked like he was simply trying not to laugh.\nRYAN GOSLING IS LAUGHING AT THE FACT LA LA LAND ACTUALLY LOST BEST PICTURE THIS IS WHY I LOVE RYAN GOSLING pic.twitter.com/LniXdflpnR \n— gosling (@allthelovhazza) March 3, 2017 And now, the actor has spoken up about his thoughts on the whole debacle (we’d already heard from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins, Emma Stone, and several others involved).\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, March 21st, Gosling simply said, “What can you say? I was very happy for Moonlight at the same time. It’s such a wonderful film. It’s great to see such great work acknowledged.” Well said, sir. Well said.\nvia GIPHY \nWe’re also glad that Moonlight received the recognition it deserves. It was an achingly beautiful coming-of-age story with an absolutely stellar cast.\nAnd Ryan, please never, ever stop being you. Because you’re a not-so-small part of the reason we get up in the morning.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:29:16.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
