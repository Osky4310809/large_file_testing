He cited terror-related arrests of Somalian nationals connected to al Shabaab, but conceded that those cases had not been admitted to the record in the lawsuit. \nWithout that evidence in hand, Flentje was exposed to counterarguments that the order was written not simply to restrict travel from dangerous countries, but with the goal of preventing Muslims from reaching the U.S. \n\"Haven't there been allegations here of bad faith?\" Judge Michelle Friedland asked at during the argument. \n\"The states are claiming that the executive order violates the Establishment Clause,\" she observed at another point. \"If that's true, and it can't meet the standards that the Establishment Clause imposes, then wouldn't it be invalid on its face?\" \nTrump's campaign rhetoric about banning Muslims proved a stumbling block, but Flentje argued the text of the executive order was itself the \"best evidence\" of Trump's intent. And the order, he emphasized repeatedly, was based on a congressional determination that the seven affected countries — Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen — pose a heightened terrorist threat.
