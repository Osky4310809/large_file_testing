He left the comfort zone, if you want.” \nLallana was 12 years old when he joined Saints' academy and Klopp added: “With his quality I can imagine everybody at Southampton thought he could be the player for the next 10-15 years to build a team around. \nWatch — Klopp on a potential Coutinho comeback in Wednesday's EFL Cup tie: Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:45:13.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
