If we lose, we lose and we lose the unbeaten run. But we’re not going to Stoke to defend our very nice unbeaten run.” Mourinho is delighted by Fellaini's form this year (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) Read More Transfer news LIVE: All the latest from the January window \nMourinho’s focus is another win to stay in the Champions League hunt and he is pleased to see Marouane Fellaini has silenced his critics. \nFellaini has had a tempestuous relationship with United fans because he was a David Moyes signing and is viewed as a long-ball player. The Belgium midfielder was targeted again after conceding a costly penalty at Everton last month, but scored against Hull 11 days ago. \n“I think they turned back in his favour after he went back to good performances,” said Mourinho. \n“He’s showing great character and the fans are showing great respect and great knowledge about his contribution.
