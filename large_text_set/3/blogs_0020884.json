Michael Moore reveals 10-point plan to ‘make Trump toast again’ \n“The Democratic Party needs to declare a National Emergency. For the first time in our history, the President of the United States and his staff are under investigation for espionage,” Mr Moore claims in the post. \n“This announcement, by the head of the Trump-friendly FBI, is a shock to our democracy. The Democratic leadership in the House and Senate needs to bring a halt to all business being done in the name of this potential felony suspect, Donald J. Trump. \n“No bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation. His presidency has no legitimacy until the FBI - and an independent investigative committee - discovers the truth. Fellow citizens, demand the Democrats cease all business.” \nMr Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch , is this week attending confirmation hearings on his position. A post shared by Michael Moore (@michaelfmoore) on Mar 21, 2017 at 11:46pm PDT \nMr Moore, who is known for documentaries Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11’, ended his post on a quote from President Richard Nixon: \"The American people have a right to know if their President is a crook.” The famous quote comes from a 1973 televised question and answer session with the press, when Mr Nixon was being probed about his tax payments. He denied any involvement in the Watergate scandal in the same session.
