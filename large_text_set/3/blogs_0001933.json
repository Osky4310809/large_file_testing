We have to continue this momentum and keep playing in the same way,\" said Safiq, who scored the third goal to seal victory. \nAhmad Hazwan Bakri bagged a double for the hosts, while Pahang's Brazilian striker Matheus Alves kept his side in the game for with a brace as well. A post shared by Official Johor Southern Tigers (@officialjohor) on Mar 3, 2017 at 5:53pm PST \nSafiq was admant that his side have enough depth to shine in all three competitions. \n\"We have got a full squad, with all quality players. So I am confident that anyone who is fielded on their day will give their best,\" he said. \nThe 2015 AFC Cup champions will next travel to Myanmar to play local club Magwe in the Group F of the competition on Tuesday before facing Uitm in the FA Cup third round on Saturday. \nJDT have returned to form after struggling for goals earlier in the season. They have now netted 11 in their last four matches. JDT and Tampines Rovers were both victorious in the AFC Cup versus Felda United and Angkor. \nCoach Benjamin Mora was also content with the overall performance of his men. \n\"We are a team who know how to attack and defend. This three points is gold, we are improving and can only get better after this,\" Mora said. \nPahang coach Dollah Salleh, meanwhile, insisted his team will be among the title challengers this season, despite their second league loss of the season. \n\"We only started playing football in the second half, and didn't fully utilise our plan. I am also very disappointed with the standard of refereeing, which left a lot to be desired,\" he said. \nIn their third round tie next Saturday, 2014 FA Cup champions Pahang will host Melaka United.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T10:01:13.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
