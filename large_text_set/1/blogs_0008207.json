Audience: hundreds of disco rave dancers. Will she do something embarrassing? Yup. Sure will. And yes, someone will be there to record it and ensure it is archived on the internet for all of time. \nWe know. Dreamy. \nIn the video, Jackson took the mic and romantically says, \n[I] love you with all my heart… and I’mma take this moment… Endy! Will you marry me!!! \nBOOM. GIRL FALLS OFF STAGE. Hilarity ensues. Giphy \nMy only complaint is how abruptly the video ends before giving a glance at Soedarsono on the floor (or, hopefully, those foam blocks). \nThe video supposedly cuts out so quickly due to Carlyle rushing to Soedarsono’s aid after she hits the ground. \nHowever, once she is safely returned to stage, he begins recording again, catching the happy ending and confirming she is not truly hurt. \nTHANK GOD. \nSome random person (maybe the DJ or, like, the MC? That’s a thing at festivals, right?) or maybe Jackson himself encourages the crowd to “make some noise” as the now-bride-to-be safely returns to the stage to accept the ring. \nSort of. It kind of looks like Jackson also almost blows it and drops the ring on stage before it actually makes it onto her hand. \nBUT ALL IS FAIR IN LOVE AND SHIRTLESS PROPOSALS! \nI can only hope Carlyle is also there to record the (techno theme and black-light lit, presumably) ceremony and reception. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
