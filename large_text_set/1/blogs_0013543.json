Means it’s Tom Cable or Kyle Shanahan for #49ers \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 16, 2017 \nThis is obviously huge news for the Patriots and Tom Brady, who respect greatly what McDaniels offers their team. This potentially could be rough news for the San Francisco 49ers, whose only other known interviews have come with Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan and Seattle Seahawks offensive line coach/assistant head coach Tom Cable. \nCable’s team lost to Shanahan’s team, so he’s available to be hired immediately. The 49ers would have to wait for Shanahan to lose to bring him on full time, thus missing out on the chance to put a staff together prior to the Senior Bowl, which is considered a big step in getting the scouting process going. The 49ers also have not hired a general manager. Can they afford to wait — potentially another few weeks — for Shanahan? Or is Cable their guy? View photo . Kyle Shanahan might be the San Francisco 49ers’ next head coach if the reports are true. (AP) \nESPN’s Adam Schefter believes Shanahan is their top target. 49ers are – and have been – honing in on hiring Falcons OC Kyle Shanahan as their HC, per sources. \n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 16, 2017 \nThe 49ers lucked their way into what appeared to be a good spot: the last team currently seeking a head coach (although we’re still keeping an eye on the Indianapolis Colts). That meant they essentially could have their pick of the litter, but that group has shrunk by one candidate. McDaniels was viewed as the favorite at one point but apparently likes very much what he has going in New England. After all, who wouldn’t? You get to work with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick and compete for Super Bowl championships every season. \nOf course, this might be as much about the 49ers’ job as anything else. It’s a full rebuild for sure, and with no quarterback in place. The next head coach will be the franchise’s fourth in four years, and Jed York might not be atop many candidates’ lists of owners they’d want to work with. Even with $70 million or more in salary-cap space, plus the No. 2 pick in the draft, there are a ton of unknowns for the once-proud franchise. \nWe also don’t know if McDaniels was told by 49ers people that Shanahan was their favorite, thus allowing the Patriots coach to publicly back out before an announcement on the job is made. This frequently happens as a measure of respect for the candidates. Shanahan missed out on the Denver Broncos’ job, but he could be a good fit for the 49ers, as he has done exemplary work with the Falcons’ offense as they get set to play for a spot in Super Bowl LI. With the opening in the 49ers’ front office, there also could be a role for his father, Mike Shanahan, even though those rumors have been quashed in the past. – – – – – – – \nEric Edholm is a writer for Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.
