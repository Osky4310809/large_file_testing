Credit Kathy Kmonicek for the New York Daily News Nothing has come to light to suggest that Mr. Morales was involved in any wrongdoing, nor has he surfaced as a target or subject of the federal inquiry. But several people with knowledge of the matter indicated that he could well be a witness for the government if charges are eventually brought in connection with the role of the mayor or any of his aides in the lease negotiation. Mr. Morales’s lawyer, Guy Oksenhendler, said city officials had given his client no reason for his firing. He said Mr. Morales “has a terrific record of public service on behalf of the City of New York” and was “highly regarded by the superiors he worked for and the civil servants who were his subordinates.” \n  Mr. Oksenhendler said in a telephone interview, “I don’t necessarily believe in things happening coincidentally.” He added, “I find it remarkably suspicious that the day that Mayor de Blasio met with the Southern District U.S. attorney’s office, within hours of that meeting being concluded, my client’s employment was terminated.” \n  City officials acknowledged that the timing of the firing, which was reported on Saturday in The Wall Street Journal, was unfortunate. But a spokesman for the mayor said the action against Mr. Morales, who won the city’s Ethics in Government Award in 2009 for setting up an integrity program at the Housing Authority when was its general counsel, had been in the works for some time and had nothing to do with the mayor’s meeting with the federal authorities. The spokesman, Eric F. Phillips, suggested that it was poor communication that led to the timing of the firing, saying that senior administrative services officials were unaware that the mayor was meeting prosecutors on Friday — a fact that was widely reported that day by the news media, and given front-page treatment in The Daily News on Friday.

Credit Dave Sanders for The New York Times \n  Mr. Phillips said the firing was part of a broader reorganization. As examples of other changes, he listed several new hires under the new commissioner, including the appointment of new deputy commissioners in May and October, and a chief of staff in January. “City Hall, while aware for some time that changes were in the works at DCAS — including the action on Mr. Morales — was not aware that these changes were set to take place on Thursday-Friday,” he said. \n  If indeed it was miscommunication and missteps that led to the curious and painful optics around Mr. Morales’s firing, then it in some measure mirrored the failures on the part of other city officials surrounding the lifting of the deed restrictions at Rivington House. That matter was initially investigated by federal prosecutors and reviewed by the city comptroller and the Department of Investigation.
