Could   \nA mum found dead at her home had posted on Facebook weeks earlier that she was \"ready to start my 2017 as strong as I've ever been\". \nKerri McAuley, 32, was discovered in a block of flats in Norwich, Norfolk, on Sunday night. \nA man in his 20s was later arrested on suspicion of her murder. \nIn a tragic Facebook post, the mum-of-two said she was looking forward to the new year and \"as strong as I've ever been.\" \nSharing a picture of presents ready for her sons to open, Kerri wrote: \"We might not of had the greatest couple of months and although I've not much felt in the Christmas spirit and it's all had to be last min I'm on the mend and I've managed to pull it all together for my babies because as mums that's what you do and I'm ready to start my 2017 as strong as I've ever been... happy Christmas everyone.\" Neighbours say they heard Kerri screaming for help (Photo: Facebook) (Photo: Facebook) Tributes have been paid to the young mum (Photo: Facebook) \nNeighbours say they heard Kerri screaming hours before her body was discovered. \nA 35-year-old woman, who asked not to be named, said: \"We saw it all going on (police activity) because our neighbours texted us. \n\"Our neighbour heard someone screaming for help. We knew it was quite serious because it was cordoned off. \n\"It's really unusual because the road is usually quite quiet. We don't really have any trouble. It's awful really.\" \nTributes poured in for Miss McAuley as friends and well-wishers left bouquets of flowers outside the flat in her memory. \nA note on one bunch read: \"Taken too soon. Sleep well Kerri.\" Another card stated: \"RIP Beautiful girl\". \nTwo of Kerri's friends Kendall Jarrett, 26, and Laura A'dore set up a JustGiving page to try and raise £5,000 to cover the costs of her funeral and a headstone. \nA message posted on the appeal site said: \"Kerri was well known in Norwich as a kind hearted, soft spoken crazy chick! \n\"She had a huge friend circle and loved by so many including her 2 young boys. \n\"She was cruelly murdered in her family home, and we want to take some of the stress away from the family with raising some money for her funeral costs and help with her two sons who luckily have a father who will be taking them on full time. \n\"We love you Kerri, rest in paradise xXx.\" \nA post-mortem examination to establish the cause of her death is expected to be carried out later today. \nPete Hornby, Norfolk Police Detective Chief Inspector, said: \"We are in the early stages of our investigation and working to establish the sequence of events which led to this woman's death. \n\"I would be very keen to hear from anyone who may have any further information that could assist with these enquiries, whether it concerns events leading up to the woman’s death or the incident itself.” \nAnyone with information should contact Norfolk Constabulary on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T06:14:30.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
