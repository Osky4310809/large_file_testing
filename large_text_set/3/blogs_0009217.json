PECO crews are trying to re-route and restore power to affected customers, but those living near the Westmoreland station could be without service for several hours. \nThe fire is affecting two local hospitals: Temple University Hospital and St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children. TU Alert: Due to PECO substation fire, power outages reported at portions of TU Hospital, TASB and Temple Towers. Details to follow. \n— Temple University (@TempleUniv) March 7, 2017 \nDue to the heavy smoke, residents living down-wind of the fire have been told to shelter in place. \nTraffic has been snarled due to the fire. There are road closures in the area of Fox Street and Hunting Park Avenue. \nFighting the blaze at the high-voltage station has proven difficult for crews. Firefighters had to wait until all the power was cut off before they could lay anything down to fight the fire. \n“We’re going to end up putting this fire out the old-fashioned way — with water — but we have to make sure power is shut down first,” said Philadelphia Fire Department Commissioner Adam Thiel. “We have companies in place right now with unmanned water streams. We’re also going to be soon putting up a ladder pipe with one of our aerial ladders, so as soon as we have confirmation the power is down from PECO, we can start extinguishing the fire.” \nSEPTA says Allegheny and Midvale depots lost power at 2:35 p.m. Power remains out at Allegheny, but power was restored at Midvale at 2:55 p.m. \nThere have been no injuries and no evacuations in the surrounding area. \nThe fire is currently not under control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:19:30.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
