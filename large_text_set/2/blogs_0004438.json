President Trump reportedly likes his female employees to 'dress like women' â€” but what does that mean? Tweet \nI wore a suit kind of like this one (sometimes with a gas mask) at my first job as a hydrologist. (Photo: Cameron Whitman/Shutterstock) \nMy first job out of college was as a staff geologist for a geological services company. In my capacity as a scientist working her way up, I started at the bottom â€” in my case that entailed taking samples around buried oil and gas tanks to ensure local water supplies weren't being contaminated.
