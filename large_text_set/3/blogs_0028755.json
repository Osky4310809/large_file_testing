We feel that the internet has given way to a revolution of consciousness by providing for the massive and instantaneous exchange of information across the globe. \nThe Free Thought Project feels that the internet is a place that can either ruin or expand the minds of individuals and that choice is up to you. Hateful and obstinate ideologies cloud the web and often the minds of those who can’t see through them. We want to change this paradigm by providing a beacon of truth amongst all the lies. \nThe Free Thought Project is a place for people to come together, who don’t necessarily agree on all topics, but who want to see a brighter, freer, and more sustainable future for humanity. \nThe Free Thought Project is dedicated to holding those who claim authority over our lives accountable. \nAs John Dalberg-Acton famously stated: \n“Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.” \nThis tendency of power corrupting can be seen from the local postal worker all the way to the President, and in other countries across the planet. Those of us at the Free Thought Project have dedicated our lives to shining light into the darkness of these corrupt entities as we believe sunlight to be the best disinfectant. We do this to help foster a more peaceful world for our children and the children of generations to come. \nWe value our readers and will frequently and peacefully interact with visitors to this page. If you are new to our site, a good starting point can be found at this link: http://thefreethoughtproject.com/category/solutions/ \nAll too often, the naysayers in the peanut gallery will tend only to point out the negative aspects of a problem and never provide a working solution. Well, the Free Thought Project feels different, which is why we’ve compiled a database of articles with potential solutions to humanity’s vast array of problems. \nThis list is by no means comprehensive, and we always value input from our readers. Please feel free to contact us via email at [email protected] or our Facebook page. \nAll topics are open for discussion, we simply ask that you keep the conversations as cordial as possible. We believe hate and vitriol only add to the already overwhelming amount of negativity in this world. If you want to see a more peaceful world, this peace starts with you. \nThe Free Thought Project was founded in 2013 by Jason Bassler and Matt Agorist. Bassler and Agorist have been activists for more than a decade and have been working in the alternative media for several years. The rest of our team consists of highly experienced journalists and content creators from all different backgrounds and our family spreads from California to New York. \nWe have been featured on many mainstream networks around the world. However, this does not mean we are funded, or otherwise supported by any of these behemoths. Up until recently, the Free Thought Project was supported by ad revenue alone. However, we’ve recently launched an ad-free version of the site that is member supported. Share Google + Dan Boersma \nThe amounts found were in the parts per TRILLION to parts per BILLION levels. In other words, extremely small. To be worried about minute amounts of an herbicide that 1 of 4 WHO organizations has declared a probable carcinogen, while ignoring the alcohol classified as a known carcinogen and is at levels thousands of times higher, seems illogical at best. \nIn addition, this at article is biased and highly inaccurate. I associate “free thought” with healthy skepticism and rigorous fact checking. Shame the author does not feel the same Stacy Mize \nI am disappointed that “Free Thought” is so filled with bias. Consider writing with facts instead of just finger pointing, and name calling. We are capable of creating our own bias, we don’t need it spoon fed to us with large helpings of propaganda. CJ Knecht \nThis site sounds like another reactionary attempt at doing absolutely nothing other than patting each other on the back, posting videos, quotes from other people, and supporting instant background checks which serve absolutely no purpose other than to continue a cycle of oppression for any number of individuals. In short, you are no different than the police. Chihuahuatude \nCycle of oppression? SMH.“[The Second Amendment] has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word ‘fraud,’ on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.”— Former Chief Justice Warren Burger, The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, December 16, 1991 Martee Hays \nOnce again a site that tells you NOTHING about who’s behind it. “About us” doesn’t mention who founded the website, who is controlling the website, who is financing the website. Legitimate no agenda websites such as Politifact.com, FactCheck.org, Snopes.com and many others are not afraid to let you know who’s behind them. The poll itself doesn’t mention how many people were polled, how they were chosen or what questions were asked. This is not a poll or website with any credibility whatsoever.

Spudslee \nThere is no validation of the articles or videos posted. If we believe everything we see on the internet without ensuring the info is factual, true or correct then we truly need to look deep into our hearts and souls. NathanMBickel \nMartee – \nYou are rightly suspicious about this website. Personally, I think it to be another government or leftist George Soros funded-type, site. It’s propaganda laden. Mixes reality with deception, etc. An example is the video of the mother supposedly being beaten by cops. If I wanted to see fakery I can go to YouTube and watch some 60’s big-time wrestling. JT \nI am the owner of the website asheepnomore.net and Facebook A Sheep No More with almost 250,000 subscribers. I am a 52 year old mom ….and Ive personally vetted the fine young men behind the scenes of this project of sharing the truth. I know who the actual owner is and the other fine ‘younger than me’ Americans who write for this website. They are not the “indoctrinated” norm of drones that have become the majority now. They believe in the nonaggression principle, and are so very talented, intelligent and will not be morally corrupted. \nSince I am in the alternative media myself, it would only be natural that we know of one another. I also vet theantimedi,org website and social media for I was actually working with that said owner so I do know what kind of character he possesses and if it was not one based upon true morality, I wouldn’t waste my time with commenting her.. I’m not going to give out their names because I do not know if they want to to known. I personally get called a dude all the time because unlike some alternative media who use their actual names etc, I don’t want that type of exposure. And in truth, I do command a tiny bit more respect by being a so-called dude …and because I incarnated into a female body, I am aware of the feminist movement that has the CIA all over it …a means to get the desired division of the divine sexes. Facebook stats show the 24-34 male audience is the largest for my page. If someone finds out I’m the owner of that website …they can always friend me on my personal page, but because this can be very burdensome with knowing people are counting on you for the truth about what’s going on, I really don’t want 250,000 subscribers to my social media to know who I am. It really is a burden to feel this duty to get non mainstream media out there to the pubic. Websites like this will never be on TV …as you know the media is controlled by 6 monolithic corporations. \nI am glad that you’re questioning every website that claims to promote liberty and not the slave state we’re currently existing in. I KNOW this owner and the other one I mentioned do not support a police state thats almost completed itself in America. Just one more false flag of large and multiple proportion could set off the wanted dialectic. \nMy name is Julie Telgenhoff as I again, personally VET these fine young men and women for their great creative talents and good work they are doing to share information that the controlled corporate media cannot. But again, glad you’re questioning. And with every type of media …there will always be a little, what you might call, bias. These talented individuals are not statists. They don’t feel that they need a nanny state to take care of them so yes, there will be a bias there as others willingly give their power over to being a slave …because those affiliated with both publications I mentioned do not need an oppressive governmental regime to “build the roads” for them. They will unite as one and do that for one another just to not have to endure this failed system of control and oppression operating under fake democracy and freedom. \nWishing you peace and kindness. Sean Uhl \nyou speak well for these people and you use certain phrases that might make someone confide in your word but I agree with the skeptics…the thing that brought me to this sight was someone else whose posts I seen, making claims to things that I do not doubt happen occasionally but are not to the extreme magnitude that he is portraying Linda \nExactly my thoughts when I saw this site being put on someone’s Facebook page. Really, Americans have lost their skepticism about things on the internet and certainly have given up critical thinking in order to sing in their chosen choir. If they are honest disseminators of information they should not be afraid to say who they are. A bit like a sensational book without an author. jymetcalf \nThis is a satirical site, right? Angry Canuck \nWhile not perhaps as angry as some others posting here, I have to admit your “about us” page really doesn’t reveal anything. You could be funded by the Koch brothers for all we know. \nWho are you? Who funds you? Whom do you represent? What’s your bias, because yes, EVERY organization has a bias, but only honest ones openly admit it. \nAdmittedly, I’d probably accept a statement about “we won’t tell you who funds us, we’d rather you judge us through our content”. Pre-judging is a problem, especially in the American press. But dissecting content for propaganda is hard bloody work, I’d rather you just came out and said it out loud. \nBe different, be honest. And stop calling me the peanut gallery. Anon \nI’ve been banned from commenting on the facebook page because I offered a rational different opinion. “free thought project” what a joke! Mason Gilbert \nBullshit. You’re just Jewish propagandists. Any mention of “freedom” and “free thought” by you is totally phony, manipulative, and annoying. I have seen The Tyrant and it is YOU. Ann Johnson \nGilbert is a surname of Germanic origin. Maybe why you seem to be anti-Semitic?? Assumptions…….much eh? Mason Gilbert \nYou mean your appeal to assumption that you’re “not Jewish” because of that dime store surname? ha ha ha ha… Please. If I had a dollar for every Jew on earth who wears an impeccable “aye magoy” disguise, cultivated by their families for GENERATIONS, I’d be the richest person I know. tracey marie", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T04:00:38.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
