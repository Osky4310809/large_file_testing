The Times article was right, however, that soft drinks are the number one commodity item purchased by food stamps households.

Turns out the main claim in @anahadoconnor ‘s NYT story about SNAP was completely false (HT @jbsoss ) pic.twitter.com/SaQlp26yf4 \n— Nathan Rosenberg (@natanrosenberg) January 15, 2017 \nThe updated article says that the USDA’s findings “show that the No. 1 purchases by SNAP households are soft drinks, which accounted for 5 percent of the dollars they spent on food. The category of ‘sweetened beverages,’ which includes fruit juices, energy drinks and sweetened teas, accounted for almost 10 percent of the dollars they spent on food.” \nLater in the updated version, however, the article incorrectly states that soft drinks are not included in the “sweetened beverages” category. “SNAP households spent 9.3 percent of their grocery budgets on sweetened beverages alone, not including soft drinks,” the article said. This is incorrect, as soft drinks are indeed included in the “sweetened beverage” category in the USDA’s full report. \nThe author’s original mistake may have come from misreading the two-page summary of the USDA study, which says “Across all households, more money was spent on soft drinks than any other item.” \nThat summary also includes a table showing a breakdown of grocery purchases into 30 categories — things like “Meat, Poultry and Seafood,”“Sweetened Beverages,” and “Vegetables.” The problem is, soft drinks are included in the sweetened beverage category, which accounts for 9.3 percent of food stamps purchases. \nThe full 49-page study, the 30 “summary categories” are further broken down into 238 commodity items. Of those 238 items, soft drinks are the number one item purchased by families on food stamps. \nSend tips to [email protected] .
