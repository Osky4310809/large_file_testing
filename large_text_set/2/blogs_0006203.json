Clemson came from 10 down to beat Alabama with 1 second remaining in the national championship game. And now the Patriots put together the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history that essentially crowned Tom Brady as the greatest player ever and Bill Belichick as the greatest coach ever. \nIn other words, it better be a darn good Daytona 500 or nobody is going to be talking about it! \nWith all these superlatives, it’s impossible to pick just one. In the aftermath of the Pats comeback, some are calling Super Bowl LI the best that’s ever been played. That’s a little rash. Through three quarters, this Super Bowl was entirely forgettable. The Falcons were playing great. The Patriots were playing terribly. The game was over for all intents and purposes. According to ESPN.com, the Falcons probability of winning was 98% or higher for most of the fourth quarter. Atlanta made some curious play calls and employed some curious clock management. New England took full advantage of the sliver of opportunity that it had, and it’s now history. \nTom Brady #12 of the New England Patriots holds the Vince Lombardi trophy after the Patriots defeat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in overtime of Super Bowl 51 at NRG Stadium on February 5, 2017 in Houston.

The story that gets talked about the most will be the Pats comeback and the individual accomplishments of Brady and Belichick. That’s just how it goes. Whatever the higher profile team does always becomes the front page news. Ask the teams that went up against the Yankees, Red Sox, Lakers or Celtics. \nThe Patriots established, or re-established almost every Super Bowl record that’s out there. Brady now has five rings to Joe Montana’s four. Belichick has won five titles, the most in Super Bowl history. The franchise passed the likes of Dallas, Pittsburgh and San Francisco in advancing to its ninth Super Bowl. If there was any question who is or was the best, it was answered, underlined and surrounded by unbreakable cement. According to most however, the Patriots already were the best. As was Brady. As was Belichick. \nWhich is why, as exciting as that finish was Sunday night in Houston, the World Series is far and away the most important, most exciting and most momentous thing that we saw in the past year. \nIt’s not just that the Cubs ended a century of futility, although that was a huge part of it. It’s that they did it by coming from behind in the series and winning one of the most remarkable Game 7s ever played in any sport. Let’s not let time obscure the Rajai Davis home run, or the Joe Maddon decision to rely too heavily on closer Aroldis Chapman, or the half hour rain delay that came after midnight on the East coast. Let’s also not forget about the Indians and their fruitless attempt to end a long drought of their own. The tension in Game 7 was the kind you rarely see in sport as both teams battled to the bitter end. The Super Bowl certainly had tension, but it was all based on whether or not the Falcons would fall and whether or not the Patriots would run out of time trying to come back. \nFootball is king. I’ll never try to put baseball above it in the nationwide pecking order. Part of the reason for that is simple. All the drama I just described to you from the World Series happened after 11 p.m. Eastern, when most Americans have gone to bed. The drama in the Super Bowl unfolded in prime time, between the hours of 9 o’clock and 10:30. Take a note NBA and MLB. Starting games at 6:30 p.m., particularly on a weekend, is not a bad thing. More people will watch. And when more people watch, more ad dollars will flow. \nHistory will ultimately tell us which game was bigger. I’m admittedly a baseball fan first. But I know greatness when I see it. While the Cubs ended the longest drought in sports, the Patriots put themselves firmly atop the NFL mountaintop. Other droughts will be broken -- yes, maybe even the Lions. But I’m not sure that any team in the NFL will ever be able to accomplish what the Patriots have over the last 20 years. \nIn terms of the overall historical accomplishment, the edge goes to the Pats. In terms of what we’ve witnessed over the past year, the edge goes to the Cubs. All things considered, the edge goes to us as sports fans based on all we’ve witnessed in these amazing championship rounds. 285 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:58:57.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
