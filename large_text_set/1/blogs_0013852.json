Vikrant is going to enter the house today, and propose to his girlfriend post which the wedding preparations will start. \n\"When I went in the house, I realised just how much I miss her and how difficult it is to stay away from her. I love Mona with all my heart, and I cannot think of a better way to seal our relationship in front of the world,\" he said. \nWell this is certainly an interesting development, considering that Monalisa was fast becoming one of the weakest contestants on the show. Guess this will ensure she sticks around till the finals!
