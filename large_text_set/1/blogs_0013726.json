The music composers are looking at our golden past to bring out new versions of our fave songs for the younger generation. We all know how the new Humma Humma song from OK Jaanu has found so much popularity with the youth, even though it also received flak for the rap portions, that people feel were quite an unnecessary addition. Now prep yourself up for the new version of Dil Kya Kare from yesteryear Julie that is going to appear in Hrithik Roshan’s vendetta drama Kaabil with the recreated Kisi Se Pyaar Ho Jaye . Now we already know that Kaabil ‘s soundtrack already has an another recreated song in Haseeno Ka Deewana , a special dance number picturised on a sultry Urvashi Rautela. If that was for the frontbenchers, Kisi Se Pyaar Ho Jaye is for the romantics. \nNow I am not saying that the new song is a brilliant as the original, even though the Julie song was composed by Rajesh Roshan, who is also the composer for Kaabil – that’s quite blasphemous. However, the recreation is not bad at all, as the new song retains the essence of romance from the original, with no rap per se. It also helps that the brilliant Jubin Nautiyal is singing this one, and though again we are not comparing with the legend Kishore Kumar, he is simply great in his own space with his mellifluous voice. Then of course there is the fantastic chemistry between the lead pair, Hrithik Roshan and Yami Gautam. Thrown in some waltz moves, and voila, the romantic song of the season is here… \nWatch the song here… \nThe new song is recreated by Gourov – Roshin with new lyrics written by Kumaar. \nKaabil, directed by Sanjay Gupta, is scheduled to release on January 25.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T11:10:46.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
