Period,\" Yiannopoulos wrote on Facebook on Sunday night. \"It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst. There are selectively edited videos doing the rounds, as part of a coordinated effort to discredit me from establishment Republicans, that suggest I am soft on the subject.\"\nIn a text message Monday afternoon, Yiannopoulos said it is still unclear whether the American Conservative Union, which organizes CPAC, would bow to pressure. On Sunday night, ACU President Matt Schlapp repeatedly defended the invitation, but he did not immediately respond to a question from the Washington Post on Monday.\nThe videos, tweeted and retweeted Sunday night by accounts such as the Reagan Battalion, had been available online for years. One clipped part of a long January 2016 interview show, Drunken Peasants, on which Yiannopoulos denounced the \"arbitrary and oppressive idea of consent\" as fellow guests asked if he was defending molestation.\n\"I'm grateful for Father Michael,\" Yiannopoulos said. \"I wouldn't give nearly such good [oral sex] if it wasn't for him.\" When pressed, he argued that his interviewers were blurring the meaning of \"pedophilia,\" misapplying it to consensual sex between post-pubescent men if one partner was below the age of consent.\n\"Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old, who is sexually mature,\" he said. \"Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty. Pedophilia is attraction to people who don't have functioning sex organs yet who have not gone through puberty.\"\nYiannopoulos did tell his interviewers that he supports the current age of consent, but an April 2016 clip of his interview with podcaster Joe Rogan found him making the same \"Father Michael\" joke, going on to suggest that sexuality is a choice, and that homosexuality, not entirely innate, often attracts people with fetishes.\n\"People are only gay to be transgressive,\" he said. \"They choose to be gay to be naughty.\"\nYiannopoulos had expressed similar sentiments for years, as his star rose on the right, telling college students in 2016 that sexual identity was \"a mixture of nature and nurture.\" In his Facebook post, he argued that he is being demonized for telling jokes about uncomfortable subjects, and being smeared as a result, despite repeatedly exposing pedophiles through his journalism.\n\"I did joke about giving better [oral sex] as a result of clerical sexual abuse committed against me when I was a teen,\" he wrote. \"If I choose to deal in an edgy way on an internet live stream with a crime I was the victim of that's my prerogative. It's no different to gallows humor from AIDS sufferers. I did say that there are relationships between younger men and older men that can help a young gay man escape from a lack of support or understanding at home. That's perfectly true and every gay man knows it. But I was not talking about anything illegal and I was not referring to pre-pubescent boys.\"\nThe ACU's Schlapp has not addressed the content of the quotes as they've attracted greater media attention. In his Sunday night tweets and retweets, he suggested that the criticism of Yiannopoulos was angering people who did not have the best interests of CPAC or free speech at heart.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T21:18:04.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
