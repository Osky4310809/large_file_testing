We need names, but we cannot go in there — it is restricted,” immigation lawyer Cristina Brown said, pointing inside the doors where CBP officials screen travelers arriving from abroad. “We need the help of family members. We believe there’s a secondary questioning room and a detention room, but we cannot verify that because the government won’t speak with us.” \nQuakers and other religious residents of metro Denver stood by welcoming travelers. Environmental engineer Laure Abercrombie, 36, carried a sign saying, “I love Syrians.” She met her U.S.-born husband in Damascas, Syria, where they studied Arabic. Now she felt compelled to make a moral stand. \n“I know I’m not going to change Trump’s directive. But I want to show Muslims walking around this airport that there are some people who care. Trump is not America,” Abercrombie said. \nAcross the DIA terminal, a separate group of about 50 demonstrators chanted and held signs, drawing fist pumps and verbal support from travelers. The demonstrators ranged from evangelical Christians to veiled Somali newcomers. “Together! United! We’ll never be divided!” \nSomali-born residents Asha Abdulkadir, 25, a quality-assurance specialist for a medical firm, and Yurup Salah, 26, an interpreter who also works for the International Red Cross, said they worry hatred of foreigners will become the new norm. \n“This hits hard,” Abdulkadir said of Trump’s order. “Our countries are included on that list. We want America to unite and denounce this hatred.” Andy Cross, The Denver Post Amal Kassir, a Syrian American, leads the crowd during an immigration protest at Denver International Airport in direct response to President Trump's executive order to ban certain immigrant from the United States January 28, 2017.
