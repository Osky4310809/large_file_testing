The robots haven't played live at all since their performance with Pharrell, Nile Rodgers, and Stevie Wonder at the 2014 edition of the ceremony—although there has been no short supply of touring rumors since then. \nThe pair, consisting of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, produced two singles from The Weeknd's 2016 LP Starboy . The song \"Starboy\" turned out to be their first number-one single ever —and in our opinion, some of their best work to date —while \"I Feel It Coming\" is enchantingly average, but equally addictive . \nThe last time Homem-Christo and Bangalter took the Grammys stage, Donald Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer took to Twitter to confusingly say he was a fan of \"Daft Funk,\" but not their costumes. \nSkrillex, Flume, and The Chainsmokers are among the electronic artists nominated for awards at this year's ceremony . \nThe 58th annual Grammy Awards will broadcast live from the Staples Center in Los Angeles on February 12. \nFollow Alexander on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:42:50.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
