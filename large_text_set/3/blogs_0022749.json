The work, entitled Beautiful Beautiful George Michael Love Painting, has been created in memory of the singer, who passed away on Christmas Day last year. Hirst, who won the Turner for cutting a cow in half and putting it in formaldehyde, created the work on canvas, using bright colours reminiscent of his spin paintings. The singer was a fan of Hirst's work, and was reported in 2007 to be considering bidding £50 million for his famous diamond-encrusted skull artwork. George Michael 'knew his death was near' The work will be auctioned in Dallas, Texas, this Friday, alongside a gala and an exhibition. It is part of MTV RE:DEFINE, an event organised by MTV’s Staying Alive Foundation, which works to fundraise and raise awareness of HIV. The Goss-Michael Foundation, which was created by Michael and his former partner Kenny Goss, are a founding partner of the event. Arts picks of the week: 20th-26th March Arts picks of the week: 20th-26th March 1/6 The Japanese House: Architecture and Life after 1945 \nThis exhibition is going to give you house goals that you will probably never be able to achieve in your damp Camberwell houseshare. But go and enjoy it anyway. It’s the first major UK exhibition to offer a look at Japanese domestic architecture from the Second World War to now, profiling over 40 architects. It includes a full-size recreation of the prize-winning Moriyama House (no, you can’t move in). March 23 - June 25, Barbican Centre; barbican.org.uk 2/6 Howard Hodgkin: Absent Friends \nHoward Hodgkin, one of Britain’s most celebrated artists, recently passed away - but it’s testament to his impact that there were already three shows planned around his work. The first is at the National Portrait Gallery, and is the first ever exhibition of his portraits. March 23 - June 18, National Portrait Gallery; npg.org.uk 3/6 The Goat, or Who is Sylvia? \nAfter the five-star success of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Comes another Edward Albee production. This time, Damian Lewis and Sophie Okonedo star in a comic masterpiece about a man who embarks on a rather interesting love affair. March 24 - June 24, Theatre Royal Haymarket 4/6 BMW Tate Live Exhibition: Ten Days Six Nights \nGet ready for something new - this is an art exhibition that unfolds over a period of time. A number of artists (including Isabel Lewis who was recently interviewed by the Standard friezeartfair.com ) will come together, to create daytime installations that are a springboard for nighttime ticketed events. Expect music, scent, food, dance and, from Fujiko Nakaya, lots of fog. March 24 - April 2, Tate Modern; tate.org.uk 5/6 People Power: Fighting for Peace \nThe Imperial War Museum is going all peace and love for a new exhibition exploring a history of peace movements. From the First World War to the present day, it will explore the things people have done to fight against war. March 23 - August 28, Imperial War Museum; iwm.org.uk 6/6 Big Guns \nExciting up and coming playwright Nina Segal’s latest play gets its premiere at The Yard this week, directed by Dan Hutton. Described as an unsettling exploration of violence and a society living in fear, it’s a great excuse for a fun trip to Hackney Wick. March 21 - April 8, The Yard; theyardtheatre.co.uk \nThe event will also include work contributed by Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas.
