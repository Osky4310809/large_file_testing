(Photo: Scott Rovak, USA TODAY Sports) 178 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe International Ice Hockey Federation has agreed to cover travel and insurance costs for NHL players as it continues to negotiate with the league about players’ participation in the Pyeongchang Olympics in 2018. \nInternational Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams confirmed the federation’s decision to cover the costs, saying in a statement, “The offer for the two Olympic Winter Games, 2018 and 2022, remains on the table and we are still hopeful there will be an agreement in the interests of all.” \nMORE HOCKEY COVERAGE: \nWhile NHL players have supported returning to the Olympics, owners have been reluctant because of disruption to the league’s schedule, concerns over injuries and questions of the benefit they gain by letting players participate. \nThe IOC had previously covered the travel and insurance costs, which Reuters reported total around $20 million. \n“Obviously, this time the owners of the NHL clubs are putting more commercial conditions to the IOC and the Olympic movement,” Adams said. “The IOC has been informed the talks between the International Federation and the NHL are continuing. The IOC knows that the NHL understands that the Olympic movement cannot treat the owners of a commercial franchise of a national league better than an international sports federation or other professional leagues with regard to the Olympic Games.” \nLast week speaking to Reuters at the Sports Business Summitt, Bettman said “as things stand now people should assume we are not going” to Pyeongchang. \nNHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly told USA TODAY Sports that it \"has never been solely about whether our legitimate expenses would be covered\" and more about the long-term interest of the league. \n\"As to the substance of the the IOC's comments themselves, there was nothing 'new' in today's story,\" Daly said. \"Its been the status quo for a number of months now. What is \"new\" is the IOC's refusal to reimburse for expenses it has traditionally paid for over the past five Winter Olympic Games (Nagano through Sochi). \n\"And, while the IIHF has assured us that it will find ways to pay those expenses, I think it is important for everyone to understand what the current thinking is with respect to the sources for those additional and newfound funding requirements.\" \nNHL players have taken part of every Olympic since 1998. 178 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:14:49.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
