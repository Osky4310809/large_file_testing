To save yourself some hassle, these are the absolute cheapest cell phone plans in the US. Advertisement \nAndroid enthusiast site Android Police dug through the various plans for every US carrier they could find—including some of the plans you can only get if you call a company rep—and found the bare minimum you can pay for each type of cell phone service. All the plans they considered had to at least include talk, text, and data. \nMetroPCS turned out to be the cheapest major carrier, with a $30/month plan that comes with 1GB of data. T-Mobile and Boost tied for the cheapest prepaid/MVNO carrier with $30/month plans, though T-Mo doesn’t advertise it and some reps don’t even know it exists. The site also recommends against buying any kind of family plan, since you can save money by just getting individual lines with more data.
