Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nEverton boss Ronald Koeman has warned Ross Barkley could be sold at the end of the season. \nThe Toffees midfielder has been handed an England recall by Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate, having impressed in recent weeks. \nBut the 23-year-old midfielder has just 15 months left on his current contract at Goodison Park, and is yet to agree an extension. \nTalks are ongoing and Koeman hopes to keep Barkley at the club, despite interest from Chelsea, Tottenham and both Manchester clubs. \nHowever, the Dutch chief admits he may be forced to sell Barkley this summer if a new deal isn’t agreed. Koeman wants to keep his midfielder - but knows he can't let him leave for nothing (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Read More Koeman fires warning to contract rebel Lukaku over his Everton future \n\"I think every situation is different. Ross is a boy from Everton and what we need to show him is the best reasons to stay,” said Koeman on Thursday. \n\"Of course his situation is different because Ross is running out next year in the last year of his contract. Normally you make decisions at the end of the season, and you need to sign a new contract or you sell the player. \n\"There is no ultimatum, no, but it's normal, it's business, you don't give every player in his last season a contract, and I think the player by himself needs to understand this, it is not an ultimatum - I spoke to Ross about a new contract and now it is up to the board to get that contract over the line, and if not, as a player you see a new future for yourself. \n\"But that is normal, it is business. At Southampton we had [Nathaniel] Clyne and he didn't sign a new contract and we sold him in the summer. \n\"It is football, but it is totally different between two and one years. One year, you need to make a decision for the club, so the club knows what will happen next year. And that is business - it's not an ultimatum, it is normal. I don't like ultimatum, it is too strong. It’s not like that. Barkley has worked hard on his game, guided by Koeman (Photo: REUTERS) Barkley has grown more integral to Koeman's midfield (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \nBarkley has made 25 appearances in the Premier League this season, scoring four times. \nHe has started every game since the turn of the year, becoming increasingly integral to a new look midfield featuring young stars like Ademola Lookman and Tom Davies, as well as January signing Morgan Schneiderlin. \n\"I don't know if the contract is close, but he is making progress and that is good for him,” added Koeman. \n“He is improving and he is the type of player we need to be strong.” What next for Ross Barkley? A new deal at Everton A new contract for Barkley would be a big statement from the Toffees (Photo: REUTERS) \nThe homegrown midfielder has made over 150 appearances for Everton since his breakthrough and after the disappointment of not playing a single minute for England at Euro 2016, he’ll hope to see action under Southgate next week on the back of recent good form. \nKoeman, along with majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri are looking to build Everton into a side that pushes for a Champions League place next season and wants them taking a seat at European football’s top table. \nThat will no doubt appeal to Barkley, Everton born and raised, but he may be looking at Romelu Lukaku’s own situation before deciding whether to commit. Heading south The duo are both interesting Chelsea (Photo: Everton FC via Getty Images) \nChelsea chiefs are monitoring Barkley’s contract situation with Antonio Conte said to be intrigued at the possibility of landing both Barkley and Lukaku this summer. \nBarkley has been on the radar of the west London side for a number of years, and the Blues are under pressure regarding their quota of homegrown players. \nJohn Terry, Asmir Begovic and Cesc Fabregas all count towards that figure, and that trio are all potentially set for the Stamford Bridge exit door this summer. \nBut Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is also understood to be keen on a possible £30million move. \nThe Argentine wants to further strengthen this summer and sees further midfield options as key, particularly with Moussa Sissoko having flopped this season and given continued injury worries over Erik Lamela. Manchester interest Barkley's running power tempts both Mourinho and Guardiola (Photo: Alex Livesey) \nManchester United have a long-standing interest in Barkley treading the same path as Wayne Rooney 13 years ago and Jose Mourinho will be given fresh funds to continue strengthening this summer. \nMourinho continues to look to shift his midfield away from being reliant on Michael Carrick, and may see a triumvirate of Paul Pogba, Ander Herrera and Barkley as one with the talent and power to take the side forward next season, where United will be expected to challenge for the title. \nPep Guardiola will also continue his overhaul of his Manchester City squad, with particular interest paid in defensive positions and at the heart of midfield. \nYaya Toure is expected to depart this summer, and Barkley's running power from deep has seen him emerge as a potential replacement. poll loading Should Ross Barkley leave Everton next summer? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T21:27:31.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
