You’ll have to wait three more months before seeing Peter Quill, Rocket, Gamora, and Drax team up again. In the meantime, enjoy their awesome new Lego sets!\nThanks to the Lego enthusiast community over at Eurobricks , we’ve gotten an early look at three of the larger Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sets they’ll be releasing.\nThe smallest of the three — and the only one so far that includes a new Rocket Raccoon minifig — is Ravager Attack. In addition to Rocket, the set also comes with Taserface (played by Chris Sullivan in the new movie) and Mantis (who was at one time listed as the 99th sexiest lady in comics by Comics Buyer’s Guide).\nAlso included: a functional stud-blasting minigun.\nNext up is Ayesha’s Revenge. It’s a mid-sized set that scores you yet another Chris Pratt minifig for your collection as well as the scarlet-mohawked Yondu and Ayesha Her self. Get it? Her? It’s an alias thing.\nLast but certainly not least is The Milano vs. The Abilisk. This is the marquee attraction of the new Lego Guardians sets, featuring an overhauled version of the team’s ship — which of course is receiving mixed reviews from fans.\nIt’s a good-sized build. The Milano has room for four minifigs… say, maybe Star-Lord, Gamorra, Drax, and Rocket (who you’ll have to acquire elsewhere). You can probably shove Baby Groot in somewhere, too. It’s not like he takes up much space.\nThere will no doubt be additional sets. It’s unlikely that Lego wouldn’t offer some smaller, impulse buy-type sets to capitalize on the launch of a new Marvel film. And now, here they are in all their glory!\nView as: One Page Slides 1. The Milano vs. The Abilisk Image: Lego \nAll good super hero movies need a good villain. For Guardians Vol. 2, that's the Abillisk: a pink, fleshy, multi-tentacled interdimensional nightmare. It's probably nothing the Guardians and The Milano can't handle... Star-Lord, Drax, Gamora, Baby Groot, and Nebula minifigs are included.\n2. The Milano vs. The Abilisk Image: Lego \nThe movie version of The Abilisk will be a whole lot bigger and more disturbing, but hey, kids play with these things.\n3. Ayesha's Revenge Image: Lego \nAyesha has made appearances in the Marvel Universe under a number of different names -- Her, Kismet, Paragon. In this set, she joins Star-Lord, Groot, and Yondu for a bit of... well... revenge, obviously.\n4. Ayesha's Revenge Image: Lego \n5. Ravager Attack Image: Lego \nThe smallest of the leaked Guardians Vol. 2 sets, this one finally includes Rocket... as well as that handsome devil Taserface and the \"99th sexiest woman in comics,\" Mantis. \n6.
