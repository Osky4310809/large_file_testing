The 42 km rehabilitation work between the Rawang-Salak Selatan and Sentul-Simpang Batu line is expected to reach completion by the end of 2019, said SPAD chief executive officer Mohd Azharuddin Mat Sah. \n“Some of the works done includes the upgrading of KTM’s 16 stations, the signalling and electrification system, and the installation of the tetra radio system for the overall KTM network except for Gemas-JB,” he said following a visit to the site of the project. \nThe remedial work is much needed in order to alleviate delays and cancellations due to failure and derailment as most of the track is more than 20 years old, he said. \nThe RM1.41 billion KVDT project, which started in the third quarter of last year, includes the laying of new tracks that will be easier to maintain, the replacement of 20-year old signalling equipment to reduce metal theft and service disruption, installation of radio systems, upgrading of 16 stations and a new feeder station in Sentul for generation of more electricity to increase train frequencies. The upgrading project is the reason for the longer waits KTM Komuter passengers are facing now. \nResponding to a question on the work schedule, unexpected delays will not be a key matter, as quality of work is of the utmost importance, said Azharuddin. “Having said that, the contractors appointed however, have assured the commission that they would be able to get the job done on time,” he said.
