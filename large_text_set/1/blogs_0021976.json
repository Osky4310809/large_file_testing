(Photo: Russ Burlingame) \nA week later, the voice says, Jason's death was ruled an accident and the family buried an empty casket. Cheryl told everyone that Jason had fallen out of the boat trying to recover something she dropped, capsizing it and drowning. The town was still dealing with the tragedy when the next mystery came to town: Veronica and Hermione Lodge, returning to Hermione's hometown because apparently the pair have no access to Hiram Lodge's money. \nHermione tells Smithers, who greets them, that she wants one of Pop Tate's cheeseburgers. \nAt Betty Cooper's apartment, she's changing while Kevin Keller sits on her bed, trying to encourage her to confess her feelings to Archie Andrews, who Kevin sees through the window and says Archie got hot over the summer. \nAt Pop's, Betty shares a story with Archie about praise she got from Toni Morrison during her recent internship. Morrison told her that one summer can change everything, and Archie agrees, saying that his life has changed, too: he realized this summer that he wants to make music. \nWhen Betty starts talking to Archie about their friendship, building to talking about their potential relationship , Archie is distracted by Veronica, who arrives to get her mother's order and introduces herself to Archie and Veronica. She introduces herself as new to town from New York, and admits she's nervous about starting at Riverdale tomorrow. Turns out Betty is the one who's guiding Veronica through the school the next day, and Archie invites her to sit with them, but Veronica declines. \nAt home, Archie tells his dad that he can't work at the construction company this afternoon because he has to go to football tryouts. \nIn her room, Alice Cooper lectures Betty about keeping focused on school and making sure her life doesn't fall apart like her sister's did. She says she needs Betty to be smart and stay focused...and to remember to take her Adderal. \nAt school, Reggie Mantle approaches Archie to ask how he got so jacked over the summer, and when Archie tells him it's from working construction, asks whether Archie hooked up with any bored housewives over the summer. Archie walks away. \nBetty starts walking Veronica through the school, and Veronica is snarky and dismissive about the school before Kevin Keller comes and gives her the skinny on the town. Veronica asks him to be her gay best friend, but quickly he upsets her by asking about her dad. She asks if everyone in town knows and when there's no answer, she realizes the answer is yes and gets frustrated. \nElsewhere, Josie McCoy and her Pussycats are rehearsing when Archie comes to ask her for some help with his music. While Melody and Valerie both look interested in Archie, Josie tells him in no uncertain terms to get lost. \nIn another hallway, Veronica asks Betty if she's dating Archie, as she's interested in him. Kevin says they aren't, but that they are \"endgame.\" He tells Veronica that the upcoming dance might be cancelled on account of the tragedy that happened with Jason. \nAt an assembly, Cheryl Blossom speaks to the school and says that her brother wouldn't want them to mourn him, but to celebrate his too-short life by moving on with theirs. While she's talking, Archie's eyes catch on the music teacher, Geraldine Grundy, and it's revealed that the two had an affair over the summer. \ndeveloping...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T04:32:27.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
