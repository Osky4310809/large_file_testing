Bravo snapped searching for bargains (Photo: Eamonn and James Clarke) Bravo was recently ironically cheered by his own fans (Photo: AFP) Bravo has conceded from the first shot he faces in 13 of his 26 games in England (Photo: PA) \nBravo appears to have lost the No.1 jersey to rival Willy Caballero, who is set to start against Liverpool this weekend, although he kept a clean sheet against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup last weekend. \nBravo’s latest error – against Huddersfield in the cup earlier in the month – meant he has been beaten by the opponents' first shot on his goal in 13 of his first 25 games for City. \nFans had even started sarcastically cheering the blundering Bravo - although favourite Pablo Zabeleta has told them off. \nHe said: “We all need to ­support Claudio – the players and the fans. He is one of us and I just wish the Manchester City fans would give massive support to him. Bravo lets in against Everton (Photo: Getty Images) Bravo looks dejected after yet another howler (Photo: REUTERS) \n“We need to help the new players and we need to ­understand that, when players go to another league, it is hard. It can be very tough and you need time to adapt. \n“We also know that goalkeeper is not an easy position. You need confidence and Claudio is not a regular starter at the moment ­because Willy has been playing most of the games. \n“We know he is a great ­goalkeeper, and his ­distribution with his feet has been fantastic.” poll loading Who should start in goal? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T19:04:02.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
