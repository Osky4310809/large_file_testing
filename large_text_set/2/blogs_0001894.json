Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA toyboy builder blackmailed a mum after they started a steamy affair while he was renovating her home. \nLiam Braithwaite, 25, had been carrying out building work on a posh flat in Canary Wharf, London, when he began a two-week fling with the woman. \nThe victim, 57, lavished him with expensive gifts including a new phone, a court heard. \nBut \"greedy\" Braithwate then decided to milk the woman for even more, asking for £2,000 because he owed money to others. \nWhen the victim refused, he then began threatening to reveal their affair to her husband, who was suffering from cancer, and their son. \nBraithwaite sent texts and voicemails threatening to \"destroy\" the woman's \"perfect little life\". \nOne message read: \"I promise, if you don't help me out I'm going to destroy your family like mine has been destroyed.\" \nAnother read: \"I don't care if you go to the police, I'm still coming.\" \nThe father-of-one initially denied the claims but then pleaded guilty to a single charge of blackmail on what would have been the first day of his trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court. Braithwaite initially denied the claims but then pleaded guilty to blackmail at Snaresbrook Crown Court (Photo: PA) \nBraithwaite was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and given a five-year restraining order preventing him from contacting his victim. \nHe is also required to complete a 60-day rehabilitation activity and 100 hours unpaid work, as well as pay £1,500 costs and a £100 victim surcharge. \nBraithwaite, wearing a denim jacket and white tracksuit bottoms, laughed as he walked free from of the dock and shook hands with his barrister. \nIrfan Arif, defending, said: \"The amount asked for was a relatively small amount in relation to what the earnings of the complainant were. \n\"It was over a short period of time and there was no actual violence, it was only threats of violence. \n\"Mr Braithwaite is extremely ashamed of himself. He understands he has acted extremely stupidly and foolishly in making these demands. \n\"He understands the pain that he's caused the complainant.\" \nPassing sentence the judge, Mr Recorder Mark West said: \"Blackmail is a despicable crime. \n\"You, out of sheer greed, threatened to disclose your affair to the family members of your victim. \n\"The extent of the distress that must have caused can only be imagined, given the family circumstances of the person concerned, which you knew only too well. \n\"It is quite plain to me that only a custodial sentence can be justified.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:00:10.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
