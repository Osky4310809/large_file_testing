His management have not ruled out fielding offers from rival clubs, but the ball, at least initially, is in Fremantle’s court. \nBut it is understood Fyfe’s decision on his future will not rest on money, given that he would command a massive contract of several million dollars, regardless of where he played in 2018. \nThe decision will be more about the prospects of on-field success in the future, with Fyfe having already sought information about Fremantle’s list management plans for the future. Nat Fyfe was one of Fremantle’s best players against West Coast in the JLT Community Series. Source: Getty Images \nFyfe, 25, is looking at signing a long-term deal, in what is expected to be the most significant contract of his career — and among the heftiest in the AFL. \nFyfe last year said he could test the free agency market — a stance that his coach Ross Lyon has endorsed. \nWhen announced as captain, Fyfe said he saw his future at Fremantle. \n“The contract stuff will take care of itself, but I have said publicly and nothing has changed that I want to play my football at Fremantle,” he said. \nIn a subsequent interview, he suggested he could sign a deal if “I feel at any point it (contract speculation) is affecting me or, more importantly, the team and the club”. \n“I’ll look to do something pretty quickly,’’ he told SEN. \nFyfe has recovered well from the broken fibula that ended his 2016 season — his second break to the left leg — and performed well in Fremantle’s JLT Community Series loss to West Coast in Wonthella. \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.
