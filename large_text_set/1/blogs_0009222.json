The latest model to reap the incentive provided under the National Automotive Policy is the Toyota Fortuner , which gets price reductions of up to RM16,100. \nThe diesel-powered Fortuner 2.4 VRZ 4×4 was launched by UMW Toyota Motor (UMWT) in May 2016 with a price tag of RM186,900. With a new EEV price of RM175,400 OTR with insurance, it’s savings of RM11,500. The petrol-powered Fortuner 2.7 SRZ 4×4 goes from RM199,900 to RM183,800 , a reduction of RM16,100. The new prices come into effect today. \n“We are grateful to the Malaysian government for recognising the Toyota Fortuner as an EEV. Since the announcement of the current NAP in January 2014, UMWT has strived to support the policy and assembling EEVs demonstrates our commitment. We are working closely with Toyota Motor Corporation to identify future models which can be assembled locally and meet the EEV criteria,” said Akio Takeyama, deputy chairman of UMWT. \n“Besides meeting criteria relating to the fuel efficiency of the model, qualifying for EEV incentives also encompasses the level of investment made, transfer of technology, localisation of components, and economic contribution to the nation,” added UMWT president Ravindran Kurusamy. \nUMWT says that the Fortuner is now the most affordable 4×4 SUV in its class. It is the fourth Toyota model assembled in Malaysia to gain EEV status after the Camry , Vios and the recently-launched Innova . \nFor Malaysia, UMWT has specced the 150 PS/400 Nm diesel to be the entry-level model, next to the 166 PS/245 Nm petrol with all the bells and whistles. Kit that separates both include bi-LED headlamps, LED DRLs, 18-inch rims, leather, Optitron meters, powered driver’s seat and auto air con.
