TNT can I stop by and get a drink\n— Charles Oakley (@CharlesOakley34) January 31, 2017 Many reporters on the scene last night claimed that Oakley was arguing with Knicks owner James Dolan before security got involved. \nIf that’s true, Oakley’s comments may have resonated with the King, who is a close friend of Carmelo Anthony. Dolan is the one who hired Phil Jackson , after all — the man who is rumored to be trying to force the star out of New York. \nJames expressed his concern with Anthony’s situation in New York last week, saying “I just want the best for my friend no matter what it is ... I just want him to be happy.” \nBut beyond that, the two Cleveland natives appear to be pals. Here’s a photo Oakley posted on Twitter during the Cavaliers’ championship parade last year: \nYou want to be down with the King Run DMC LeBron James pic.twitter.com/DX6bjuqrLv \n— Charles Oakley (@CharlesOakley34) June 22, 2016 And in a November New York Times article , Oakley said he has cooked food at James’ house before: “We cool. Cooked at his house before. Everybody enjoyed the food.”\nAll things considered, it makes sense why LeBron came to Oakley’s defense. It will be interesting to see if LeBron chimes in if any more drama involving the Knicks surfaces.
