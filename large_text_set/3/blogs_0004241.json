Also at that time, a local North Carolina Republican office was firebombed, causing conservative-leaning media to pounce on CNN for suggesting Trump’s rhetoric spurred the incident. \nWhile CNN’s perception levels steadily declined for three months beginning in August, the scores fell even more sharply at that mid-October point, hitting bottom around Election Day. \nEven a few weeks after Election Day, another hit prevented CNN from recovering, coinciding with its reports on spotting fake news and its impact on the election. CNN itself was the victim of a fake news scare in late November, when somebody tweeted that the network broadcast pornography instead of an episode of “Anthony Bordain’s Parts Unknown.” \nThe network, which Trump has repeatedly said is “fake news,” even labeling it the “Clinton News Network,” has had a hard time recovering ever since.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:16:30.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
