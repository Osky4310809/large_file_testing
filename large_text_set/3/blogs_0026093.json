He says the suspect also made threats in New Zealand and Australia.\nHe says the investigation was carried out with the help of the FBI and police from other countries.\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, there have been more than 150 threats this year against Jewish institutions in 37 states and two Canadian provinces.\nStay with CBSNewYork.com as this story develops. \n(© Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
