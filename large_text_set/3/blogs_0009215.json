Bellew celebrates after halting Haye in the 11th round at The O2 \n\"I think he's shown a more humble side to him, which he needed to show, because in the build-up to this fight, he said some horrendous things,\" Bellew told Sky Sports News HQ . \n\"It was at one stage I did send my children and my missus away from the country, because I didn't want them to hear what he was saying. My missus was in tears about this man saying how he was going to put me in hospital and he's going to end my career on that night. \n\"I sent them to Dubai, because I didn't want them to hear any more of what he had to say in all honesty.\" The Merseysider showed compassion to his bitter rival \nHaye had been hindered by an Achilles inury during his 11th-round stoppage defeat and was helped back to his corner by Bellew, who questioned whether he would have been shown the same concern. \n\"This whole build-up, I've just been me. I was there at the end,\" said Bellew. \"Would he have shown the same compassion to me? If he had done to me what he said he was going to do in one or two rounds, he would have just belittled me, laughed at me, and made a fool of me. He really, really would of. There was no way back for me. If he had done to me what he said he was going to do in one or two rounds, he would have just belittled me, laughed at me, and made a fool of me. Tony Bellew \n\"I looked at him and while my promoter and my trainer were jumping for joy and screaming on me, I looked at the man and he was hurt, he was badly, badly hurt. \n\"He didn't have one person close to him, I'm being totally honest, who cared and wanted to help him back, and I did. \n\"I felt for David, because I know what it's like to be a loser, I know what it's like to be stopped on my feet. I just wanted to help him back to his stool.\" All the key moments as Bellew defeated Haye at The O2 on Saturday night \nTrainer David Coldwell has advised Bellew to retire and the 34-year-old will carefully weigh up his options, which could include a rematch with Haye. \n\"I'm going to take time. I know what my coach wants, my coach wants me to stop, because it's the perfect time to do it,\" he said. Tony Bellew has plenty of potential heavyweight foes \n\"I'll make the best decision for me and my family. The next decision won't be made with David Haye in mind. The next decision won't be made with boxing in mind, the next decision will be made with me and my family in mind. \n\"I can't tell you yes I'm going to retire, I can't tell you yes I'm going to fight again, because the true fact is - I don't know. I do know it will take something very, very big to draw me out of that bed.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:32:39.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
