Arter and partner Rachel had a stillborn daughter 14 months ago (Photo: Stuart MacFarlane / Arsenal FC) \n\"When the rainbow appears, it doesn’t mean the storm never happened or that the family is now dealing with its aftermath. \n\"What is means is that something beautiful and full of light has appeared in the midst of the darkest clouds.\" \nFollowing Bournemouth's match against Manchester City on Monday night, Arter thanked Pep Guardiola for his best wishes on the birth of his daughter. Arter in action for Bournemouth (Photo: Bryn Lennon) \n\"He offered his best wishes for me and my partner this week, which was an unbelievable touch,\" Arter said. \n\"He is someone I have a massive amount of respect for. I watched his Barcelona teams - and look at his Manchester City side tonight. \n\"For me, he is the best manager in the world. I don’t think there’s anybody close to him and what he has achieved. For him to offer that to me, I respected it and accepted it with a smile on my face.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:48:43.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
