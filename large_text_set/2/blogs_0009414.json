It was hard for her to see herself in that role and she was very frail.” \nMeanwhile, it emerged that Tara could have been dating a “difficult” older man for five months before her death. \nShe was seen with the man on Saturday afternoon by a friend who worked in local gastropub The Bottlery. \nViktor Krrashi said Tara had changed over the last three years, losing a lot of weight, despite claiming she put on a stone over Christmas.

Once they started dating, Tara’s previously weekly visits for wine and champagne faded out. \nTara was with her new mystery man on Saturday, Viktor claims. \n“She stopped at the door and said Hi,” he said. She looked thin and ill but she was always happy.” Tara Palmer-Tomkinson's car (Photo: TIM ANDERSON) \nA builder working on Tara’s apartment block claimed she had been behaving erratically. \nLast Friday, one of his colleagues had described her as “acting crazy” at around 4pm. \nThe man, who did not want to be named, recounted his friend’s interaction with Tara, saying: “He said she had come downstairs to talk to them and she was acting crazy.
