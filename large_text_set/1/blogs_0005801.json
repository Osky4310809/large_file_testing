May 11, 2016 Bedside Manner Wait Time The experience with Dr. Siefferman is completely different from any other doctors in amazingly great way. He is a doctor who genuinely cares for his patients. I have a spinal nerve problem and my pain is in all over my body. Before Dr.Siefferman, no doctor could fix my pain. I was in pain, miserable and depressed. Dr.Siefferman takes time to examine,listens to whatever I want to say patiently..and gives me variety course of treatment plans(medications,injection,PT,etc..) Great things is if I have a question or problem I can always e-mail him and he usually replays back right away.. No doctor does it!!! He ordered physical therapy as a part of treatment, and he often communicates with my therapist so my PT progressed well. Now thanks to Dr.Siefferman I got my life back! I feel better and better everyday. Less than a year ago by a Verified Patient Bedside Manner Wait Time He was very professional and explained everything in simple, kind terms.

December 17, 2015 Bedside Manner Wait Time I was very impressed with Dr. Siefferman. He took his time, listened and then explained his thinking and plan in great detail.

July 9, 2015 Bedside Manner Wait Time Doctor Siefferman was patient and considerate, he answered all of my questions thoroughly. His excellent bedside manner and technique made individualized care a reality. More than a year ago by a Verified Patient Bedside Manner Wait Time I have been a patient of Dr Siefferman for the past year and my experience has been AWESOME! An accident years ago left me with multiple spinal injuries and severe chronic pain / physical neurological weaknesses. Before seeing Dr. S. I had already had Spinal Fusion surgery, Arthroscopic Spinal surgery, many many Interventional procedures and tried \"every\" pain medication regimen out there. I was using Docs. at NYC's best hospitals / Pain Mgmt. groups, yet was still on a slew of pain medications and still in terrible pain. During my 1st visit Dr. Siefferman suggested I try to wean off the mix of pain meds I was taking to see what would happen. I could stop reducing the meds at anytime if I felt things were getting worse, after so many years on meds. (and still in pain) it made sense to try something else. He said he would be available via phone, text & email 24/7 to insure I was comfortable (he was). We would replace the meds with many types of interventional procedures, physical therapy and other non drug modalities - the results have been AMAZING! Dr. S. spends 30 - 40 minutes with me during office visits and he responds to my emails / phone calls promptly. He is patient, engaged and is concerned with all aspects of my health. He has referred me to other health professionals and all of the practitioners have been really solid as well. When I have seen him during pain flair ups he gave me (trigger point, \"anesthetic\" injections) in the office that provided immediate relief. If pain has put a crimp in your life reach out to Dr. Siefferman, he offers \"concierge\" medical service and a huge toolbox of treatments. Dr. S has improved the quality of my life immeasurably!
