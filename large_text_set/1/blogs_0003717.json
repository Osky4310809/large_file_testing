A bold statement, but since 14.8 million people watched her win The Great British Bake Off in 2015, she’s officially been named one of the most influential people in Britain. Along with the likes of Adele and Kate Middleton . \nShe was asked to make the Queen a special birthday cake, (not Mary Berry , the actual Queen), charmed us in her telly special The Chronicles Of Nadiya, has released a cook book, a cake book, a kids’ cake cook book, and now a new kind of book – a women’s novel called The Secret Lives Of The Amir Sisters. \nWhen we meet her she’s clutching a copy of it and staring at it open-mouthed. \n\"People are actually going to read this, aren’t they?\" she frowns. \"Maybe I’ll see someone with it on a train!\" she squeals, the book jumping out of her hands. \nFrom shock to excitement in less than a second flat, that expressive face of hers is even more beautiful in the flesh. No one raises a perfectly lined eyebrow quite like our Nadiya. She doesn’t disappoint. The Queen cuts the cake Nadiya baked for her (Photo: Reuters) \nShe’s wearing snazzy metallic gold loafers, and spends 15 minutes telling us about the next shoes she’s going to buy (mock-croc iridescent turquoise with gemstones), and yes, she does reference how good the shoe shopping is in her beloved Milton Keynes, having moved there last year to be closer to her family. \nWith two more novels to write in the series, planning another wedding to her heart-throb husband Abdal who she wed in 2003 through an arranged marriage, and being mum to Musa, nine, Dawud, eight, and Maryam, six, she has more than just cake on her plate. But she can cram it in. She’s good at that. In fact, we’re not sure she stopped for breath once throughout our conversation… \nDo you remember life before Bake Off? \nYes, and I really have to pinch myself. I was a stay-at-home mum doing the cleaning. I did love that, though, I really miss it. \nReally? \nI literally get so excited now gathering a pile of ironing. Then I wait for the day when I can get stuck into it. \nOne of the most influential people in Britain loves ironing… \nHow mental I was even on that list? I’m so average. My parents make sure I don’t think my job is any better than my siblings’ jobs. And my sister saves up a huge pile of dirty dishes and asks me to wash up when I pop round. She knows I won’t say no. Then she takes pictures of me and puts them on Facebook with the caption, ‘Not that famous’. So no framed magazine covers at mum and dad’s? \nNope. They don’t have anything with my face on. Honestly, if I want to keep my feet on the ground, I go home. With the attention you suddenly get, I can see how fame goes to people’s heads. But I still pop to my mum’s and do her hoovering and muck out her chickens. \nYou’re a natural on the telly – were you secretly quaking with nerves? \nI wasn’t. Does that mean I am a natural? \nYep. \nOoo. Well, going to Bangladesh to film The Chronicles Of Nadiya was quite scary. I wanted it to be meaningful and to make people want to visit. Hot, though, 46 degrees most days. I couldn’t even hide in the shade filming, because all they were getting was eyes and teeth. So I was stood out in it all day, burning. On a boat. With some otters. Making it work.

I suffer from panic disorder, and before, my kids were my crutch. Everywhere I went, they came too. It was a comfort. I had my eldest young, you see, at 21. But it’s good now, because he’s 10 and he’s useful, so he can do dishes. \nHighs and lows… \nExactly. And the panic attacks won’t ever go away, but I’ve learnt to manage them better. But some days it’s hard. \nIs it harder now you’re in the public eye? \nWhen I’m with the kids, I try not to do pictures, just so I can draw a line somewhere. I’ll stop and chat for England, though. \nHave you experienced any racism? \nI’ve experienced racism from such a young age. I’ve grown up with it. To be honest, I almost expect it everywhere I go now. It’s a part of who I am. Do I let it get me down? No. Because I don’t want my kids to grow up thinking England isn’t a nice place to live, when it is. \nCan you go out unrecognised? \nI actually can’t. It’s so weird. My husband can be 10 steps behind me in the supermarket and he’ll hear people saying, ‘That’s Nadiya.’ People recognise him first. It’s that lovely face of his. \nHow did he find becoming a heart-throb overnight? \nHmm, every now and again he gets these tweets from ladies [raises her eyebrows]. He’ll say, ‘This girl said that I’m hot. Look. She must be six years younger than you. At least!’ All proud of himself. Nadiya and husband Abdal \nAnd the pair of you are planning to get married again… \nWell, we’ve had the Islamic marriage, but we want to have the proper ceremony now. Last time I didn’t get to pick my dress, flowers, or even the groom. Plus I actually quite like my husband now, so I will mean the vows. He still has a fat a*se, though. It was the first thing I noticed. \nReally? \nObviously I’d seen pics. But my sister saw him on our wedding morning. My nephew ran into him and when she bent down to pick him up she had this big butt in her face. She ran upstairs to tell me, utterly horrified. The fat a*se remains to this day. \nSo no cake before the big day then? \nHe’s lovely as he is. He can keep it. \nWould you want arranged marriages for your own children? \nNah. When they’re older I’d rather be on a cruise ship chilling out than looking for husbands and wives for them. Traditions evolve, and when they’re old enough I’d rather they picked someone. I want to be in a sports car with Abdal on a road trip having fun instead.

But the boys couldn’t care less. They put me in my place. My nine year old tasted one of my cakes and said, ‘Is this some kind of sick joke, Mum?!’ and slammed the door. Bit harsh, eh? I did win a baking show. \nDo other mums panic at the bake sale? \nI never get asked to bake. Maybe they’re nervous. But if I bake for the kids and their school friends, I shake them up in the Tupperware to stop them looking so pristine. Then stick my finger in and ruin the icing to make them look a bit messy. \nIs there a lot of pressure knowing the nation loves you? \nA bit, but I have a good verbal filter for speaking on telly from having the kids. So I’m not too prone to dropping the F bomb. Unless I’m with my sisters, where I’m forever saying things I shouldn’t be saying. Our group chat’s outrageous. \nIs there pressure to look your best? \nIn January every single woman goes on a diet. Well, I’m not, forget it. I've spent my entire adult life trying to look perfect and lose weight and I really am fed up with the pressure. I’m more concerned about teaching my kids to use the dishwasher. \nThat’s a good priority… \nWe share the work now I’m not a stay-at-home mum. If my kids see the washing machine full of wet clothes, they hang them out to dry. I don’t have to ask. That’s what I’m most proud of. Ever. They need to be useful to me, right? Hell, I’m not doing it all! Unless it’s ironing. That’s all mine. \nFoodie Q&A \nBiggest baking disaster? A chocolate cake that fell to the bottom of the oven. I’d done a roast the night before and hadn’t cleaned up. I scooped it up and my husband insisted it was fine to eat. So we did. Chocolate cake, chicken fat and custard. Disgusting. No wonder he has a fat a*se! \nGuilty pleasure? \nInstant mash with tomato soup over the top. But I add butter, mayo and cheese into the mash. \nFavourite weird flavour combo? \nMango and parsley is delicious together. My lot will eat all sorts. I cook cheaply for my kids, so they eat tongue, offal, even tripe. \nDo you use your own cookbooks? \nMy family do! They get copies of all my books from me. Signed. Not that they care.
