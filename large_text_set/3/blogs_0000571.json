Insulting military widows by saying they love publicity is not one of them. Claims that Goldberg disparaged military widows, especially Carryn Owens (the widow of Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens) are false .\nAccording to Snopes , the fake claim originated on The Underground Report, a disreputable website that claims to publish “real news you won’t get from the mainstream media.” The article purported that the grieving Navy SEAL widow that was invited to President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress was “looking for attention.” It continued:\nWhoopi Goldberg is in hot water after comments she made Wednesday regarding the Navy SEAL widow that was honored last night during President Donald Trump’s historical speech.\n“She was just looking for attention. These military widows love their 15 minutes in the spotlight”, Goldberg said.\n“If it were me I wouldn’t be able to leave the house. How can someone who is truly greiving go out there and be on TV. It just doesn’t make sense to me”\nGoldberg’s fake comments were then turned into a graphic that was widely circulated on social media. The image featured photos of Owens and Goldberg with the aforementioned quote about military widows loving their “15 minutes in the spotlight.” Goldberg, however, never spoke these words about Owens or any military widow.\nDuring Wednesday’s episode of “The View,” Goldberg and fellow co-hosts did discuss Owens, however, they made no disparaging remarks about her. The hosts discussed how they felt as though Trump exploited Owens’ grief and criticized Trump for trying to pass the buck and use Owens as a “political prop.” Goldberg agreed that no one puts their grief out there for publicity.\n\nAt the joint address to Congress on Tuesday, Trump introduced Owens, which led to a standing ovation from those in attendance. He stated :\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that — and I quote — “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.” Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you. And Ryan is looking down, right now — you know that — and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\nSome viewed his words as heartfelt and thought he truly created an emotional moment. Trump’s words did not sit well with everyone, however, as some felt as though Trump put Owens on display for his own political gain. Many felt as though that idea was confirmed when he commented about breaking a record.\n\nIn response to the situation, Goldberg did not insinuate that military widows love their 15 minutes of fame. This claim is false.\nSocial Media Reacts to Fake Whoopi Goldberg Quote wow @WhoopiGoldberg ..I'm sure she would rather have her husband back than her \"fifteen minutes\" pic.twitter.com/JomqxxGGcp \n— Amy Elizabeth⚜️ (@nine0h7) March 2, 2017 \n\nboycott her show, disgrace!
