Across the nation, communities are seizing January 20th as an opportunity to demonstrate the power of unity in overcoming darkness, and from inspiring Post-it-covered walls to the eleven-year-old offering “emotional-advice therapy” in the NYC subway, many are doing so in creative and unprecedented ways. To prove that #LoveTrumpsHate and that we are #StrongerTogether, a group of San Francisco artists called “ satoriteller ” is organizing “ Bridge Together Golden Gate ” - the first human chain across the Golden Gate Bridge. Rain or shine, 25,000 people have pledged to wear purple and link hands across the iconic landmark.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ARsCu2MMKCk\nThe artist collective is rallying locals to hold hands across the bridge to form a “shining beacon of inclusiveness and democracy” and hopes to demonstrate that “the hateful rhetoric of the in-coming president & his administration will not be tolerated.” The group emphasizes that the event is a “community-based demonstration and performance art piece” and not a protest or march. There are no plans to obstruct traffic or cause disturbances of any kind.\n\nSo far, satoriteller has raised over $20,000 in donations, part of which is being used to fund event necessities like porta-potties and EMTs. The remaining funds will be donated to Southern Poverty Law Center , Planned Parenthood , and The Trevor Project .\n\nAccording to satoriteller, the color purple is a symbol of unity and anti-bullying. Set against the dramatic backdrop of the one of the world’s most famous bridges, Bridge Together Golden Gate is an inspiring reminder of the power of peace and the need to remember that only love can drive out darkness.\n+ Bridge Together Golden Gate \n+ satoriteller \nPhotos via Bridge Together Golden Gate \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:02:44.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
