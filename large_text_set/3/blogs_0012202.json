Photograph: Paul Quayle/Alamy View more sharing options Press Association   11.05 GMT \nMore than two million tonnes of throwaway plastic soft drinks bottles are sold each year, with only a small proportion made from recycled materials, research reveals. \nA survey by Greenpeace found five of six global soft drinks firms sold single-use plastic bottles weighing more than two million tonnes – only 6.6% of which was recycled plastic. \nIf figures from Coca-Cola, which did not disclose how many tonnes of plastic it sells, were included, the numbers would be much higher, the campaigners said. \nSingle-use drinks bottles are a visible part of the problem of plastics pollution in the world’s oceans, forming the most common type of plastic packaging found washed up on shorelines globally , Greenpeace said. The west’s throwaway culture has spread waste worldwide | Waste packaging Read more \nMillions of tonnes of plastics are ending up in the ocean every year , harming marine wildlife , taking centuries to break down and spreading toxic chemicals. \nGreenpeace wants soft drinks brands to do more to tackle marine plastic pollution , for example by producing more 100% recycled bottles and committing to phasing out the use of throwaway plastic. \nLouise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “We know that plastic bottles are a huge ocean-polluter and in the UK alone we dump 16m of them in our environment every day. \n“If we’re going to protect our oceans we need to end the age of throwaway plastic. \n“Companies need to move away from single-use plastic, embrace reusable packaging and make sure the rest is made from 100% recycled content.” \nCompanies responding to the survey are taking action including reducing plastic by making bottles thinner or using bioplastics which are not made from oil, and removing “problem plastics” to make them more recyclable. \nBut Greenpeace said lighter and bioplastic bottles still contributed to marine pollution , and did not compensate for the growth in the total volume being produced. \nThere was also a move away from refillable bottles, low levels of recycled plastic used in drinks containers and opposition to deposit return schemes which pay people to return empty bottles, according to the green group. \nThe firms surveyed by Greenpeace were Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Suntory, Danone, Dr Pepper Snapple and Nestle.
