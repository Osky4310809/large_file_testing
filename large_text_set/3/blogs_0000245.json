(Charlie Archambault for USN&WR) × \n\"I'm very disappointed in what the president has been doing, what his administration is doing, and I don't want to convey business as usual, everything is fine. Because everything is not fine,\" Engel tells U.S. News. \"He's been in office 30-some days… starting off with barring immigrants and that ridiculous fence. There's a big cloud with Putin [and] Trump's ties to the Russians. That's very disturbing. Antisemitism is running rampant – they've made some perfunctory statements, but they haven't really grabbed the bull by the horns.\" \nBut most \"damning,\" Engel says, is what he sees as an assault on the free press by the Trump administration. He noted the decision to bar several news organizations from a white House briefing last week. \"I didn't think we did that in America,\" Engel says. \"And I don't think I can be quiet as we have this kind of authoritarian [trend] coming upon us. This is far beyond disagreeing with someone's position. This is a whole style. This is authoritarian style, and we don't have that in America.\" \nThere may be less competition all the way around for the aisle seats at the address (lawmakers are not given assigned spots and are not allowed to save seats with personal items). New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell, a Democrat, told Fox News he's not sure where he's sitting, but it won't be on the aisle. And a spokeswoman for Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee told Politico the congresswoman won't shake Trump's hand. \nIt's an unusual rebuke of a first-term president.
