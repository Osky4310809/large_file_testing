The marks were located directly behind the spot where the iceberg pierced the ship’s lining. \nThe fire was likely caused by a fuel store behind one of the ship’s boiler rooms. Crew attempted to put the fire out, but were unsuccessful. \n“We are looking at the exact area where the iceberg stuck, and we appear to have a weakness or damage to the hull in that specific place, before she even left Belfast,” Molony told the Independent . Molony said that the fire’s high temperature could have weakened the ship’s steel by 75 percent. \nNow historians are calling the sinking of The Titanic a product of criminal negligence. \nIt’s been rumored before that The Titanic was travelling exceptionally quickly because crew onboard knew of the fire raging down below. They considered it a “time bomb” and attempted to reach New York before the ship exploded, under orders from the ship’s owner, John Pierpont Morgan. \nA 1912 investigation into the incident suggested that because of the ship’s high speed, crew did not have enough time to avoid the impending iceberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:04:23.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
