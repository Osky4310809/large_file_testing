Today, we can confirm that Huawei will join that small group and will launch a Tango-based smartphone of its own.\nSee also: Best of Android: Our 2016 Manufacturer of the Year is Huawei 6 hours ago There’s nothing else we know at this point about Huawei’s Tango phone, other than it is due for release in the near future, not even a code-name. Although we imagine that it will be packing in similarly power hardware to existing Tango handsets. We do know that competitor Lenovo plans to launch a Moto Mod for its Moto Z lineup of phones that will allow them to gain access to Tango’s AR tech, along with another stand alone Tango phone sometime later in 2017.\nSo far, most app developers have decided not to make AR apps that work with Tango. Indeed, there’s only about 36 Tango-capable apps in the Google Play Store at the moment. Today in a blog post, Google said that more of these apps are in the works, including one from the clothing retailer Gap called DressingRoom that will allow Tango phone owners to place clothes on virtual mannequins, which should allow owners to see how they look in a real world environment.\nFor more information on what Huawei has planned for the future, be sure to check out our exclusive video interview with the company’s CEO Richard Yu at CES 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T03:32:44.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
