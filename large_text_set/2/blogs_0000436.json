To recap, during one of the first tasks, the celebrities had to guess the secrets of the Indiawale team. Manveer had told Bani that he was married, but later confessed that it was a joke to fool her into giving the wrong answer. Later on he also mentioned that he was \"almost married\" but he escaped, and was living away from his family now. — Bigg Boss live (@biggbosslive) January 31, 2017 \nThis video fueled those rumors and Manveer's statement did nothing to help. A video was doing the rounds where he was asked by a reporter about his marriage and his reply was, \" Zaroori thodi hai ki har tag batana pade . Wo sab chalta hai ( It's not necessary that you need to mention every tag. It's all okay). \nHowever, his mother has a totally different story to tell. \n\" Mere bete ki shaadi nahi hui hai. Jo news mein aur media mein aa raha hai woh galat hai Aisa koi bhi, kuch bhi bolega aap bharosa karoge? Uski shaadi hogi badi dhoom dhaam se . (My son is not yet married. The media reports are fake. Will you believe in anything that anybody says? He will get married with great fanfare.)\" \nWe really don't know which side is true. Guess we'll just wait and watch for now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:47:06.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
