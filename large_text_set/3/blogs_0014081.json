New homes near Grove to go on sale this fall for $300,000 \nThe project calls for 50 new market-rate homes and 40 apartments in two buildings. \nThe project calls for 50 new market-rate homes and 40 apartments in two buildings. \nWork will start within weeks to turn land owned for years by Washington University’s redevelopment arm into nearly 150 new homes in Forest Park Southeast. \nChris Hulse and Kyle Miller of Unify Grove Development plan to build 50 new homes along Vista, Norfolk and Swan, in the southwest corner of the neighborhood near Newstead Avenue. The 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom houses are projected to sell for $300,000 to $350,000. \nThe development, called the View at Newstead, will also include two 20-unit apartment buildings. The first units should be ready by August or September. \n“All the financing is in place, we’re just waiting for neighborhood approval,” said Hulse. \nThe developers are seeking full tax abatement for 10 years and a Community Improvement District. New homeowners would make payments in lieu of property taxes to the CID to pay down bonds used to finance infrastructure including resurfaced streets and alleys, lighting, landscaping and signage. \nInterspersed with the market-rate housing, Rise Community Development is nearly ready to start building 50 affordable townhomes . Called Adams Grove, the project is supported by $1.2 million in state and federal low-income housing tax credits. \nIn all, $27 million in residential investment will be pouring into one of the few areas of the neighborhood surrounding the Grove commercial area that has seen little activity. About 23 vacant houses will be demolished for the project. \n“We are thrilled we are getting so much attention and investment south of Manchester, south of the Grove,” said Brooks Goedeker, who heads neighborhood improvement group Park Central Development. “That is sort of the last vestige in the neighborhood of what hasn’t developed yet.” \nPark Central hosted a neighborhood meeting Monday night and its development committee was slated to make a recommendation to the city on Unify Grove's project this week. \nGoedeker estimates the neighborhood added about 1,000 residents since the 2010 Census, when it recorded an all-time low of 2,900 people. With more than a dozen other new homes and rehabs underway south of Manchester Avenue and about 300 apartments planned to the east near Vandeventer Avenue, he expects to hit 5,000 neighborhood residents by the 2020 census.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:11:43.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
