Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 27, 2017\nYeah, it's not much to go off of.\nSEE ALSO: This deleted 'Fantastic Beasts' scene reveals some magical new details\nBut even a page is enough magic for the muggles and no-majs out there.\nThe first film — Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them — debuted in November.\nThe spinoff was inspired by a Hogwarts textbook of the same name. It was written by Rowling and directed by David Yates, who also directed the final four films in the Potter franchise.\nIt starred Oscar winner Eddie Remayne as \"magizoologist\" Newt Scamander, Katherine Waterston (of Inherent Vice ) as a witch named Tina and Colin Farrell as a wizard named Graves.\nOn Sunday, the film picked up an Oscar for best costume design, which went to Colleen Atwood, marking the Potter universe's first Academy Award.\nAll we know for sure about the second installment is that Gellert Grindelwald, aka \"the second most dangerous Dark Wizard of All Time,\" will definitely make an appearance .\nThe second installment is expected to roll out in theaters in November of 2018.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/836242703612534784", "https://t.co/xRGCC9gt3B"], "published": "2017-02-28T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:29:56.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
