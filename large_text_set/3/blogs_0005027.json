Trump was interviewed by Russian goverment TV the day Sessions met Kislyek: https://t.co/sHQiGwX2oQ \n— Dafna Linzer (@DafnaLinzer) March 2, 2017 \nTrump appeared on a September 8, episode of the RT show, Politicking , hosted by his friend and former CNN anchor Larry King . He was previously interviewed by King on the same program in 2013. RT, a Kremlin-backed Russian media outlet , is well-known as a front for Russian propaganda. \nDuring his January 10 confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions told Democrat Al Franken (MN), “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.” \nIn remarks to NBC earlier today Sessions clarified that he had “not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaign.” The Attorney General added that he would consider recusing himself from any Department of Justice investigation into Russian election meddling. \n… And for anyone keeping score, September 8, 2016 was also a consequential day for Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson who asked his now infamous question, “What is Aleppo?” \nHave a tip we should know?
