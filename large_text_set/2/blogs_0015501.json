She caused a sensation. Many scientists had believed cloning animals was impossible. Dolly’s creation showed that DNA in a differentiated cell could be repurposed through nuclear transfer, opening up two new possibilities. One, “reproductive cloning”, was the copying of individual animals. The other was the creation of embryonic stem cells (ES cells) capable of being turned into other types of cells. Various ailments are caused by a lack of specific types of differentiated cell. Making embryos through nuclear transfer seemed likely to provide ES cells with which to research and treat such conditions—something that came to be known as “therapeutic cloning”.\nReproductive cloning has made steady progress. It has been used successfully in 20 species, including ferrets and camels. Meat and milk from cloned animals are routinely farmed and sold in the United States, Argentina and Brazil. Prized pet dogs and polo horses are now provided to customers—for a price. \nBut therapeutic cloning, which required human embryos to develop nuclear-transfer techniques, raised ethical concerns. Press and public alike fretted about imminent human cloning and designer babies. It also turned out to be tricky. By 2006, nuclear transfer had still not produced human ES-cell lines. That year Shinya Yamanaka, a Japanese scientist, unveiled a method of converting differentiated tissues back into stem cells, without the ethically troubling intermediary of an embryo. These “induced pluripotent stem cells” (IPS) garnered a huge amount of attention, funding and effort. They could be made from cells donated by a potential patient, meaning the patient’s immune system would raise no objections. That was not necessarily the case for ES cells. It took until 2013 to crack the tricky problem of how to create human ES-cell lines. However, because nuclear transfer remains difficult and is banned in many countries, IPS cells still look the most promising option for future therapies. \nRead our full briefing .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:29:09.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
