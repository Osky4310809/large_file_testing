(Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press) Perhaps what is fueling President-elect Donald Trump’s ongoing venom toward critics and his unquenchable desire for affirmation is his awareness, at some level, that more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton — and worse, a significant majority still do not like him.\nGallup reports :\nAs Donald Trump prepares to take the presidential oath on Jan. 20, less than half of Americans are confident in his ability to handle an international crisis (46%), to use military force wisely (47%) or to prevent major scandals in his administration (44%). At least seven in 10 Americans were confident in Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in these areas before they took office. . . . The deficits for Trump versus the average for his predecessors range from a low of 15 percentage points on defending U.S. interests abroad to a high of 32 points for preventing major scandals.\nHe starts out in a much worse position than his predecessors with Republicans, Democrats and independents:\nOn average, 21% of Democrats have confidence in Trump across the five presidential duties for which Americans also rated Bush and Obama (all except handling the economy and defending U.S. interests abroad). By contrast, for the same five areas, an average of 60% of Republicans were confident in Obama and an average of 57% of Democrats were confident in Bush. These data underscore the much more polarized partisan environment in which Trump will be taking office.\nTrump also fares much worse among independents on the same five tasks (50%) than Obama (79%) and Bush (75%) did.\nConfidence in Trump among his own party’s supporters (84%) is closer to that of Obama (94% among Democrats) and Bush (95% among Republicans), but still trails their levels by a significant margin.\nMost noteworthy, his lowest ratings come in confidence he will avoid scandals (44 percent overall, 77 percent for Republicans, 46 percent for independents and 14 percent for Democrats). His refusal to disgorge his business and avoid obvious conflicts of interest and constitutional violations (i.e. the emoluments clause) may be his biggest vulnerability and the most effective starting point for anti-Trump forces. Incessant focus on his concealment of taxes, on his continued deal-making in foreign countries (including Indonesia) and his contempt for ethical norms would not only unite Democrats but peel off support from independents and already queasy Republicans.\nIronically, “Crooked Hillary” was an enormously successful strategy against Clinton, not only because she gave critics plenty of ammunition but because the public already thinks pols are inherently trustworthy. Trump got away with playing the outsider during the campaign, but now as the ultimate pol — the head of the party and of the executive branch — it makes him vulnerable to the very same charges he leveled at Clinton: He thinks he is above the rules, he selfishly puts personal interests ahead of public concerns, he looks at all criticism as illegitimate, and he is jaw-droppingly greedy. (Doesn’t he have enough money yet?)\nOutside groups, state attorneys general, lawmakers and the media would be well-advised to correlate policy moves with benefits to Trump’s businesses and keep a running total of instances in which he receives monies from foreign governments and their related entities. The country may have rejected Clinton as untrustworthy but Americans are about to find out that compared with Trump, Clinton was Mother Teresa.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@JRubinBlogger", "http://www.gallup.com/poll/201158/skeptical-trump-handle-presidential-duties.aspx?utm_source=twitterbutton&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=sharing"], "published": "2017-01-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T02:56:09.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
