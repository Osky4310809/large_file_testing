BusterH \nwhy? because you don’t like their politics? Anthony Velazquez \nIn this case, I don’t agree. And I also don’t agree they are just NOW speaking up. They never said anything as far as I know about Obama deporting a record number of immigrants. But when Trump wanted a temporary ban on some countries they decided to chime in? Seems like they are doing EXACTLY what you are accusing me of…because they don’t like his politics. Paul Lloyd Johnson \nThere are exactly 0 reports of children ever being molested by trans people in bathrooms. We don’t need this law, we already have laws against the molestation of children. NapMan \nAll he did was give the power back to the states. It’s not all about molestation, it’s about government overreach. Paul Lloyd Johnson \nIf a state is telling trans people where they can and can’t go to the bathroom, that is government overreach. MrGayAgenda \nMaybe girls just don’t want to change in front of a dude. People have a right to their privacy. Greg_the_Rugger \nThanks to the bright folks in NC, ladies are obligated to pee next to a hairy chested tattooed guy. Anthony Velazquez \nNot in this day and age, the rights of the .01% have to trample on the rights of the rest of the population for the sake of political correctness. SMH Paul Lloyd Johnson \nA trans woman isn’t a dude. JohnnyF1ve David Hall \nLeaving aside the transparently absurd idea that a gadget manufacturer has “thoughts” of its own, about anything, I’ve no interest whatsoever in what Apple thinks on this subject. I am though quite interested in why they’ve not introduced any meaningful desktop product upgrades since the neolithic era. Apple’s thoughts on that would be interesting to hear if Tim Cook can climb down from his social wars bully pulpit to long enough to address such a mundane issue. Len Williams \nThe problem here is NOT that there is a great concern about transgender/gay people molesting children. Take a look at how this misguided attempt at inclusion and fairness can be abused. Take for example a man or woman who is a sexual predator (of whatever type). This person can use the excuse to enter the bathrooms of the prey he/she is seeking in order to find victims. This attempt at gender equality means that a hairy chested, burley truck driver could say that he identified himself as a woman, and this would allow him to freely walk into women’s bathrooms at will. It opens the door to HUGE privacy issues and voyeurism run rampant. It then becomes uncomfortable or unsafe for women to use public restrooms because any man can walk right in while they’re changing clothes or using the facilities. If he says he’s gay, how do we prove he’s not? This permissive law immediately creates the potential for unsafe conditions — NOT from gays or transgenders necessarily, but from sexual predators who say they identify themselves as the opposite sex, solely for the purpose of their voyeuristic or unlawful sexual activities. Greg_the_Rugger \nThere are already peeping tom laws on the books. Bathroom laws like the one in NC demand that the hairy truck driver, who was born woman, must use the women’s toilet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:55:33.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
