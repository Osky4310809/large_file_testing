The former Chilton student wasn’t played by Chad Michael Murray — in fact, it was someone completely different. While Tristan was only on screen for literally less than a second, fans still made sure to voice their concerns.\nChad Michael Murray appeared on Entertainment Tonight to chat about his brand new show Sun Records , and interviewer Leanne Aguilera made a point to ask the actor why he wasn’t involved.\nYou know what? His answer was solid. Sad and upsetting for fans, but totally understandable. “I wasn’t available at the time. I was pretty positive I was having a baby, my first child. It just did not work into what we were doing at the moment,” Murray said. “I know that somebody went out and was Tristan, but it wasn’t me.” Even sweeter, he gave a brief round of applause to the actor who took on the role , Anton Narinskiy. Since it didn’t even require any lines, surely that should make Narinskiy feel pretty darn good about himself.\nMurray and his wife Sarah Roemer did have a baby, a boy, and are already pregnant with baby #2 . So, it would seem that Murray is definitely enjoying fatherhood.\nIt also seems like Murray still has a soft spot for his character of Tristan. We’re sure he would have tried to make it work if he truly could. Then again, Tristan was pretty much getting kicked out of Chilton regularly, so having a stand-in is actually somewhat perfect, if you think hard about it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:05:01.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
