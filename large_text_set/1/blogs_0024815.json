They will never stop being interested in you, or admiring you, or wanting to have new experiences with you. They’re practical, which also makes for a great partner (granted, if that’s what you’re looking for).\nTaurus (April 20th to May 21st)\nA Taurus would be the husband you choose for status. \nThey are lovers of the material, and would be all about making sure you lived in a nice home, and kept the holiday cards looking Kardashian-levels of chic. A Taurus is highly sexual, and you’d definitely have a great physical relationship. This doesn’t mean every Taurus is heartless. Of course, they are often very kind-natured people. It does, however, mean that you should be aware that getting involved with a Taurus will not come without it’s fair share of focus on the material things in life.\nGemini (May 22nd to June 21st)\nA Gemini would be the husband that is obsessed with you. \nGeminis generally have 0 chill ever, about anything, and when it comes to their life partners, the same would apply. You may run into trouble if your Gemini starts to question things or get spooked, or worse – bored – but trust that if they are the right person for you, they will come around eventually. You will have to get used to the Gemini’s talkativeness, and the way they can almost seem flirtatious with people they don’t even know. This is just in their outgoing nature. Even if the Gemini is technically an introvert, they will be socially gracious, ambitious, and very vocal about their dreams. Life with a Gemini would be a ride, but things would never be boring.\nCancer (June 22nd to July 22nd)\nA Cancer would be the loving, stable husband. \nHe would be focused on not only making sure you are always comfortable and happy, but pouring every bit of love he has into your relationship. Cancers are known for their emotionality, as well as their grounded, homemaking skills. Combine the two and you will have a pretty epic life partner. Arguments will subside quickly, and they will truly be your best friend and your lover.\nLeo (July 23rd to August 22nd)\nA Leo would be a protective husband. \nThey are notorious for their sense of self and ego, and that would extend itself to you, too. They would support you unconditionally, and defend you fiercely. If they love you, they will love you with their whole heart. They would want to see you stepping into your full and most fearless self, and would do whatever they could to make you feel as safe and loved as possible.\nVirgo (August 23rd to September 22nd)\nA Virgo would be a care-taking husband. \nVirgos love nothing more than to know that the people who they care the most about are okay (they’re known for being healers, activists and medical professionals). They would want to make sure you were happy and comfortable every day of your life. They are fierce lovers, and when they become invested in something, they truly give it their all. Though they are often galavanting away on their next big dream (a trip, a community rally, a new project) once you’re let into a Virgo’s heart, you can stay there always.\nLibra (September 23rd to October 22nd)\nA Libra would be the ultimate romantic husband. \nLibras are ruled by Venus, the planet of love, so this is pretty much the ultimate in terms of choosing a life partner. Libras love beauty, balance and peace, and will do anything to ensure that your home is harmonious and orderly. Libras will not only make sure you have an amazing sex life, but will also make you feel truly seen and loved. They are big on expressing their affection, and making you swoon. Libras can err toward being vain and lazy at times, but usually their drivenness and obsession with love overrides those traits, and makes them truly unforgettable partners.\nScorpio (October 23rd to November 22nd)\nA Scorpio would be a loyal husband. \nHe would stick by you truly no matter what (this is often a fault of Scorpios, they can’t let go when they oughta). A Scorpio would love you fiercely, even if they hid most of their emotion from you on the surface. Once you enter into a relationship with one, they begin to show the true depth of their passion. They epitomize “all or nothing” personalities, so if a Scorpio commits to you, expect it to be for the long haul.\nSagittarius (November 23rd to December 21st)\nA Sagittarius would be an adventurous husband. \nWith a Sag, you wouldn’t be “settling down,” you’d be taking off. A Sagittarius would always want to be spicing things up in the bedroom, taking weekend trips, and learning about you – and the world – together. Sags are notorious for being “jacks of all trades” types and once they become interested in something, they give their energy to it completely. Though Sags will be reluctant to settle down, when they meet the right person, they will come around and do so. If there’s anything a Sag wants to avoid, it’s an amazing experience missed.\nCapricorn (December 22nd to January 20th)\nA Capricorn would be a responsible husband. \nCapricorns are known for being grounded, future-oriented, and super practical. They would be very earnest, and pretty serious at times. Capricorns are the ultimate choice if you want a relationship that will be steady. Though they can sometimes get too stuck in their ways, and become frustratingly slow to act, they are ultimately very good partners and, when the relationship is right, are not usually afraid to commit in a serious way.\nAquarius (January 21st to February 18th)\nAn Aquarius would be an independent husband. \nAcquariuses need love like anybody else, but they’re also the most independent of all the zodiac signs. They are committed to a life of philanthropy, humanitarianism, and making the world a better place in whatever way they can. They are very often entrepreneurs and business-owners. Be this as it is, they will always be balancing your relationship with their other goals. It’s not that they don’t love you, it’s that they are inherently incapable of just losing themselves in one person. That’s not how their minds or hearts work. As they are often have strong personalities, being with an Aquarius for life will ensure you’re never short on adventure and ~opinions.~\nPisces (February 19th to March 20th)\nA Pisces would be a passionate husband. \nPisces are known for being the most emotional and intuitive sign of the whole Zodiac (being last, they are bits and pieces of everyone combined). When they commit to someone, they are endless wells of love and devotion. They will give you a truly spiritual romantic experience, and will go out of their ways to perform beautiful gestures of this passion for you. Naturally creative, they will be writing poems, making art, and generally trying to build a beautiful mind-body relationship between the two of you. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T04:02:01.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
