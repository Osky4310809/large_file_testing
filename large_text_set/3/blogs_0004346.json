One of the big reasons why is that being in a relationship actually changes your sense of self. Here’s how that affects you post-breakup, and what you can do to feel better. Advertisement \nWhen you’re dating someone, they introduce you to new experiences that you might adopt as your own, like a new hobby, band, social circle, or local spot. Expanding your own horizons, and identity, is exciting, but when you breakup you may feel like you’ve lost that part of yourself because the person you shared it with isn’t in your life in the same way. \nHelp heal that sense of loss by focusing on yourself to get over their absence , and adjust back to your identity as an individual. Recapture who you are on your own by diving into hobbies and reconnecting with friends. Overcoming a breakup is a complex process, but if you put energy towards rebuilding your sense of self, you’re on the path to moving on.
