Her weathered skin is deeply creased, taut and beautiful, and her hair is pulled back tightly, adorned with a bright white bow that resembles a rose. She is dressed up for this portrait in a festive, Sunday-best, black-and-gold sweater vest, sparkling earrings and three thick strands of pearls. \nArtist Noé Montes took this photograph of Rosales de Bañuelos as part of his Coachella Valley Farm Workers project. A 2015 Alicia Patterson Foundation grant allowed Montes to spend the larger part of a year researching and photographing people of the Coachella Valley –– many of them farm workers or children of farm workers –– who are actively working to improve the lives of individuals in their communities. \nMontes' Coachella Valley portraits are intimate and kind. On their own, without backstory or context, they are immediately impactful works of art. But the photographer's portraits, landscapes and contextualizing images are merely an entry point to what is ultimately a much larger and more complex, politically and socially significant artwork. \nClick on Rosales de Bañuelos' \"written profile\" at Montes' coachellafarmworkers.com , for instance, and you can read her incredible life story, communicated beautifully through Montes' direct and honest prose. \n\"Maria was in an abusive relationship for most of her life,\" the artist writes about his subject. He goes on to tell how, at age 60, she attended a meeting where she heard other women speak about domestic abuse. \"For the first time she saw herself from the outside, she gained self-awareness. She had never thought that she did not have to live with violence. This was a turning point in her life.\" \nMontes tells how, after Rosales de Bañuelos established financial independence and left that abusive relationship, she went on to become a leader in the Lideres Campesinas organization, helping to educate women across the Southwest about their rights. \nA similarly powerful story lies behind each of Montes' Coachella Valley Farm Workers portraits. In addition to the artist's written profiles, many of the project's subjects tell their histories in their own voices in single-shot videos that feature stoic backdrops such as a post office, a nondescript intersection or a used car lot with its flags and banners blowing in the breeze. As a whole, Montes' project relays a deeply researched and complex story, not just about a group of individuals but about a region, an industry, a culture and a society.

The son of immigrant farm workers himself, Montes grew up picking crops in the fields of the San Joaquin Valley every day after school, on weekends and over long, hot summers. His parents worked hard to make a life for Montes and his two siblings in the United States so that they could go to school. They were constantly moving from farm to farm in search of the next crop, the next job. Montes attended multiple elementary schools per year, and remembers more than a few nights spent as a family in the car in between jobs and apartments. \nAfter high school Montes attended a junior college, where he studied electronics. His first job doing component-level repair work earned him enough money to explore his lifelong interest in art by taking a few evening classes, including a photography course, at a local community college. \nFor Montes, looking at the world through a camera lens was transformative. \"I found that it was a way that I was able to understand the world, to remove myself from it a little bit and observe it more objectively. I was also able to express myself, to express the results of those observations through photography,\" he explains. \nThat objectivity and outlet for expression led to a growing sense of agency, and photography gave Montes the ability to envision a bigger life for himself. He dedicated himself to developing his skills as an artist, supporting himself by doing technical work, printing and Photoshop for stock agencies. Eventually he was able to make a life as a freelance photographer in Los Angeles, where he now lives in Mid-City with his wife and two young children. \nAs a young photographer, Montes avoided making art about immigrants or farm workers. \"For a long time I didn't want to do any work about that,\" he says, \"but eventually I came around to thinking that I really had a responsibility to do something about that subject.\" \nToday, the mostly blank walls of Montes' small Koreatown studio are punctuated by two large pieces of paper, tacked to the wall with strips of blue painters tape. On each is a simple statement, handwritten in thick black or blue Sharpie: \"Take Action\" and \"Make Work,\" they read. “It’s not luxurious, but I’m also not working like my parents. Their bodies are broken. They spent their whole life working in the fields, and I’m not doing that.”—Noé Montes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:55:22.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
