On Sunday night, Locals Only posted a Facebook status apologizing for the incident and informing the public that the employee responsible for the sign had been fired. \nBar co-owner Jonathan Condren told the CBC that the sign was not acceptable at all, and that his staff would be receiving new sensitivity training on acceptable workplace behaviour. \n\"We're all immensely upset, shocked, disgusted, appalled and truly apologetic, of course,\" he told CBC. \"There's no place for a sign like that to be anywhere.\" \nWhen asked by the CBC about allegations of similar signs and sentiments in the past that have been hung around the bar (one reportedly read, \" Snapchat me that pussy ,\" referencing the popular \"Down in the DMs\" lyric by rapper Yo Gotti), Corden said that all other incidents have been dealt with swiftly, and that the signs are an unfortunate byproduct of the bar trying to be edgy. \n\"We try to make the place a fun environment for our staff to get involved and do things, and obviously sometimes if they're unsupervised these things happen and we immediately come in and rectify the situation,\" he said. \nLocals Only did not immediately respond to VICE's request for comment. \nRead More: Another Frosh Week, Another Terrible 'No Means Yes' Controversy \nThis incident comes just weeks after another Toronto bar was shut down after a woman was allegedly locked inside and gang raped by two employee s. The men involved in that case have been charged with 16 counts including sexual assault and forcible confinement. \nIn the past, both La Carnita and El Furniture Warehouse—two popular Toronto establishments—have come under fire for their social media posts. Last year, La Carnita posted an image on social media making light of President Donald Trump's infamous \"grab her by the pussy\" remarks by joking about grabbing their trademark tacos. \nFollow Jake Kivanc on Twitter. \nLead image via Facebook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T19:48:41.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
