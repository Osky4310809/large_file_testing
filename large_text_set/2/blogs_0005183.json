But the animated show has never aired an episode with such a storyline . As Snopes first reported , the fake image was picked up in Spanish-language media, where the rumor about Trump‚Äôs death on the show has been disseminated to millions. It is also spreading on the English web.\nThe image itself appears to have originated on 4chan, according to the Mexican YouTube channel Badabun . There‚Äôs also no evidence that the Huffington Post ever ran a story on it, despite the watermark on the image.\nID: 10491072 2. The fake image has fooled many people into thinking The Simpsons actually featured Trump‚Äôs death in an episode. The Simpsons are the illuminati they predict everything right fuck they recently predicted Trump's Death in an episode\n‚Äî Ese Pollo (@Alejand67478749) ID: 10491760 The Simpsons predicting Donald Trump's death ü§î\n‚Äî natty üñ§ (@QueenKaiJay) ID: 10491757 4. The hoax is also getting attention because of (sketchy) claims that the show has predicted many other things that came true. So the Simpsons predicted that Donald Trump gonna Die and they haven't been wrong On predictions\n‚Äî Stats (@BigPapiStats) ID: 10492521 5. This conspiratorial video says that Trump‚Äôs apparent death on the show is the ‚Äúmost creepy‚Äù prediction yet. Video available at: https://youtube.com/watch?v=kJjCn3h91gg . youtube.com The video has been viewed more than 25,000 times and bolsters its argument with previous examples of the show ‚Äúpredicting‚Äù future events like the 9/11 terrorist attacks .\nMany such examples of the show‚Äôs eerie predictive power fall apart under closer scrutiny, though, and it‚Äôs worth taking them with a big grain of salt. The image of Trump‚Äôs death on The Simpsons is another hoax.\nID: 10491198\nIshmael Daro is a social news editor for BuzzFeed and is based in Toronto. Contact Ishmael N.
