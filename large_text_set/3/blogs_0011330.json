Bomer and Ruffalo played lovers in HBO’s 2014 drama “The Normal Heart.” \n“To the Trans community. I hear you,” he wrote on Wednesday. “It’s wrenching to you see you in this pain. I am glad we are having this conversation. It’s time.” \n“In all honestly I suggested Matt for the role after the profound experience I had with him while making ‘The Normal Heart,'” he added. To the Trans community. I hear you. It's wrenching to you see you in this pain. I am glad we are having this conversation. It's time. \n— Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) August 31, 2016 In all honesty I suggested Matt for the role after the profound experience I had with him while making \"The Normal Heart\". \n— Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) August 31, 2016 \nProducers announced on Aug. 29 that Bomer and John Carroll Lynch are starring in “Anything,” with Timothy McNeil making his feature directorial debut. Ruffalo noted two days later that the movie had already wrapped in response to a suggestion that the Bomer’s role be recast. @Vodstok The movie is already shot and Matt poured his heart and soul into this part. Please have a little compassion. We are all learning. \n— Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) August 31, 2016 \n“Anything,” and more movies such as Eddie Redmayne’s “The Danish Girl,” faced backlash from the community due to the fact that a cisgender actor is playing a transgender character. \nThe movie also stars Maura Tierney, Micah Hauptman, Margot Bingham and Melora Hardin. Ruffalo and Great Point Media’s Robert Halmi and Jim Reeve are executive producing. \n“Anything” is based on McNeil’s play of the same name. Lynch plays a man who is suicidal over the death of his wife and moves from Mississippi to Los Angeles, where he can be under the watchful eye of his protective sister, played by Tierney. He then begins an intense friendship with Bomer’s character. The unlikely new couple must reconcile their vastly different backgrounds as they fill the void in each other’s lives. \n“Anything” is being produced by Hauptman, Louise Runge, and Ofrit Peres. Bomer, Tony Lipp, and Scott Wexler also executive produce. \nGreat Point Media is the distributor. UTA Independent Film Group helped put the film together and is the U.S. sales agent. \n“I’m very happy to be part of this daring project,” Ruffalo said in the Aug. 29 announcement. “Love is at the essence of great storytelling and transcends all discrimination and politicization.” Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T00:31:36.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
