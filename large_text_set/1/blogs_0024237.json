My then boyfriend (now husband) and I hadn’t been careful and found out I was pregnant.\n“Everyone was very kind and at no time were they judgemental or unsupportive. I do not regret the choice we made, even now that we have two small children. While I don’t think I feel shame, there is still a stigma. My husband and I have never told anyone and I don’t know that I ever will.”\n- Anonymous 36\n“I wish I’d known was that the termination would trigger lactation, which was terribly painful.” “I had a late term surgical abortion after discovering I was pregnant only two days previously. It was in a very discreet, modern and lovely clinic in a capital city. The staff were wonderful. The whole treatment cost $2500 upfront, which I was unprepared to pay but privileged enough to borrow. It all happened so quickly that I didn’t really have time to dwell on the situation - I just did what I had to do. One thing I wish I’d known was that the termination would trigger lactation, which was terribly painful.\n- Anonymous, age unknown\n“I felt a lot of guilt and grief without anyone to talk to about it. “I had a surgical abortion at the age of 20 at a private clinic. I found the experience daunting and lonely. Due to social stigma, I did not inform many people about the procedure apart from a few friends. The procedure itself was pain-free and the staff at the clinic were very professional.\n“I felt a lot of guilt and grief without anyone to talk to about it.\n“I would not be able to give the child or myself a good future and the father was unsupportive… I’m happy I went through with the procedure and had no regrets but the grief I felt after the procedure was hard to deal with alone.”\n- Anonymous, 23\nView this image ›\nWomen’s March, Sydney, 2017. Lane Sainty/BuzzFeed News\nID: 10392064 “The abortion experience itself was amazingly painful.” “I consented to unprotected sex but believed the guy would pull out. Instead of pulling out, he came inside me… didn’t tell me but when I asked him if he had finished, he just started laughing. I was stupid to let this happen, but he was mean to do what he did.\n“I had a medical abortion. I’m lucky enough to live in a country where I can receive this help and have our Medicare system help pay for the procedure. The clinic I went to was amazing! From the girls on reception to the doctors themselves. All amazing women and I cannot thank them enough. I was never once made to feel bad about my decision. I was constantly offered counselling and given a 24hr number to call for any questions I had.\n“The abortion experience itself was amazingly painful. I’ve never felt pain like that before in my life.\n“I took the first tablet at the clinic, and then 24 hours later at home I took the second dose. The doctors weren’t lying when they said it would work quick! I had hot flushes, shaking, chills, vomiting and of course intense pain. I felt like I had the urge to push.\n“After four hours of pain, I fell asleep and woke up with a pad FULL of blood and tissue.\n“I never thought I’d be in this position. But there I was. I was so annoyed at myself for letting it happen. I still feel guilty, but I know it was the right choice, deep down.”\n- Sam, age unknown\n“I didn’t think I could have possibly even been pregnant because I hadn’t known what had happened to me.” “I was a few weeks off my 25th birthday when one night I was raped by several people while I was unconscious. I woke up with a stranger on top of me, I pushed him off and got out of there as fast as I could.\n“I didn’t think I could have possibly even been pregnant because I hadn’t known what had happened to me, and that was traumatising enough in the first place.\n“I tried to distract myself from reality for a while because I couldn’t deal with everything that was happening. After a few more weeks I knew I couldn’t put it off anymore, and I called my sister for help. I was incredibly lucky to have such a great sister who didn’t ask me any questions and supported me through this very difficult time. She respected my decision and even made the appointment for me, took me there and took me home and looked after me. I don’t know what I would have done without her. I’m also very lucky and grateful to live in a state where abortion is legal. I don’t regret my decision at all.”\n- Anonymous, 29\n“They hadn’t done the termination properly.” “I was 22 and fell pregnant to the boy I was dating at the time. I knew straight away I couldn’t keep it, due to struggling quite badly with depression and self-harm. Once I told him I was pregnant, he pretty much broke up with me straight away. He was a selfish, emotionally abusive loser.\n“My mum came with me. You sit around in a waiting area with other women there for the same reason. I was the only one there with my mum, everyone else had their partners with them. All the doctors and nurses were really nice and supportive, I didn’t feel judged at all.\n“I was told to expect some bleeding and a few small clots and not to panic because it was normal. I was still bleeding about a week later and it was getting heavier and the clots were getting bigger… it turned out I had retained products. Meaning, they hadn’t done the termination properly and left some behind which had then caused an infection. I had to have the procedure done all over again the next day.\n“I don’t regret my decision, there was no way I could’ve cared for a child and provided a stable, loving environment at that time in my life.”\n- Renee, 30\nView this image ›\nBowdenimages / Getty Images\nID: 10392139 “I struggled for about three years to be around mothers with small children.” “I had two abortions at the age of 19. I’m not sure why but when I first found out I was pregnant my instant thought was to get an abortion. I think I was petrified and didn’t know what else to do.”\n“The process only took about two to three hours from check in to check out.”\n“It was honestly the hardest thing I ever had to do. I struggled for about three years to be around mothers with small children. I think the guilt and grief ate away at me… I definitely see myself having children in future but I hope it will be when I’m married to an amazing man.”\n- Tay, 23\n“At no time did I feel an attachment to the foetus, or that I was making a mistake.” “I had an abortion when I was 22 and in living with my then boyfriend.\n“The day before my abortion we had a huge fight about my indecision [and] he left me alone in our flat and drove to his parents to get drunk with his friend. I woke up the next day alone and I knew there was just no way we could be parents. I called my friend and she picked me up and drove me to the last minute abortion appointment I booked at 8:00 a.m. that morning.”\n“I remember him saying that if I kept the baby he would leave me. The procedure took about two hours and I withdrew the money from my savings account at an ATM on the way. When I got to the clinic I had the option of looking at the ultrasound or looking away and I chose to look at what I was giving up. At no time did I feel an attachment to the foetus, or that I was making a mistake.”\n“When I woke up my friend was waiting and I basically got straight in her car and went for burgers!”\n- Melissa, 25\n“It was stressful to organise the procedure because of the legal complexity between states for the procedure.” “I found myself pregnant at an age where you shouldn’t think twice about continuing on with a pregnancy… Because of my age and relationship status, the doctor provided no advice or assistance with any alternative than continuing with the pregnancy.”\n“Being in Australia, it was stressful to organise the procedure because of the legal complexity between states for the procedure. For the record, it was emotionally challenging and not recommended, but so important to have as an option.”\n- Renee, 25\nView this image ›\nPro-choice supporters rally outside the Queensland parliament in Brisbane, 2016. Dan Peled / AAPIMAGE\nID: 10391841 “The amount I paid for a medical abortion was a surprise.”\n“As I’m writing this I’ve just taken the second dose of medication for my abortion. This causes the uterus to contract and empty which explains that when I think of the experience I’m going through I immediately think of the pain. Because that’s all I can think of at the moment. It hurts. A lot. The cramps, the bleeding, nausea and vomiting; it’s intense.”\n“But, despite the pain, I’m thankful this option was available and legal for me. It’s allowed me to choose when to bring a child into the world, on my terms and when I’m ready. I think a child deserves being supported completely. The amount I paid for a medical abortion was a surprise though I understand why - I was taken care of.”\n- Bella, 19\n“My husband and I knew it would break us to have another child going through that.” “I had an abortion in early 2015. It was the most emotional experience I have ever gone through. I already had four children, one of whom has a degenerative genetic condition. At first, I was elated to see the two pink lines on the pregnancy test, then the worry set in about the chances of another child with the condition. My husband and I knew it would break us to have another child going through that. A couple of weeks went by, spent in a numb state and plenty of tears while we figured out what to do. We made an appointment with our GP who discussed all options (adoption was out, as I knew I wouldn’t be able to give it up after pregnancy) and was supportive after he gave us a referral for a medical termination.”\n“I had a few minutes alone before being taken to the procedure room where I sat, talking to my unborn child, apologising for what I was about to do, apologising that I couldn’t be its mummy, but I loved it anyway and we would be together again one day.”\n“Physically, I felt good after the procedure, but numb. The nursing staff understood my reason and were supportive.”\n- Caroline, 31\n“If I was ever unfortunately in the same situation again, I would still choose to put my child’s happiness ahead of my own.” “I have always known I’m one of those people who was just born to be a mum. My decision to surgically terminate my pregnancy was the most heartbreaking and best choice I have ever made. I had miscarried a much-wanted pregnancy the year before, and my marriage was falling apart, with my husband not wanting to try to fix it. So I had the choice of raising my child in a dysfunctional, unhealthy and broken relationship, with a father who would never have loved them as much as they deserve, or to not make that child suffer for years to come.\n“I have never once regretted my choice, not even for a second. It was painful, it was gut-wrenching, and if I was ever unfortunately in the same situation again, I would still choose to put my child’s happiness ahead of my own.”\n- Nicole, 28\n“If it was up to me I would have kept the baby.” “I didn’t want to have the procedure but the father of the baby and my parents basically gave me no other choice but to have it done. I paid for it myself with my full weekly pay. I was pretty emotionless before it happened. They gave you counseling [before the procedure] but I didn’t really want to speak because I felt so bad and guilty about what was about to happen. I had a surgical abortion when I was about six weeks along.\n“If it was up to me I would have kept the baby but because I care about what others think so much I let my family and the father force me into it. I think about it nearly every day. Sometimes I hate myself for it and [some days] I don’t, I just get sad. My friends wanted me to keep it and ever since I don’t think they have really treated me the same.”\n- Molly, 22\nView this image ›\nPro-choice protesters attempt to drown out speakers from Pro Life Australia during a protest on the steps of Parliament House in Melbourne, 2007.

I was on the pill and didn’t even realise until I was almost eight weeks along. It was a pretty straightforward decision - we just weren’t ready. We were too young, too poor, we had been together less than a year. That’s not to say it wasn’t a tough decision, because it was. We felt like we could[n’t] tell anyone, our parents would have been so disappointed. The medical staff were amazing, so compassionate. I didn’t feel judged at all. I know we made the right decision. Eleven years later we are now married and have gone on to have two children. No regrets.\n- Jacqui, age unknown\n“The only regret I have is that I didn’t use the support for aftercare.” “I was 21 and had been dating a guy for about a year before he up and left for another girl without so much as a text to me. A few weeks later I found out I was pregnant. I wasn’t working at the time and not for a moment did I think about keeping it. I had nothing [to] offer this baby and it was clear the father was not interested [in] helping me and I couldn’t deny his happiness for my own.\n“The only regret I have is that I didn’t use the support for aftercare. At the time I was very emotionless and just did it without fully putting my feelings into place. I struggled for a long time after, coming to terms with actually being pregnant and having an abortion. At the time I was a robot going through the motions. Looking back now I am happy with my decision and the support from my friends, family and the wonderful people at the clinic.”\n- Emily, 27\n“We lived in a country town in NSW so we had to drive to Sydney to a clinic.” “I am a mother to a beautiful little girl who is four. A couple of years ago I accidentally fell pregnant to my husband during what we thought was a safe time. When I did the pregnancy test the joy I should have felt at the thought of becoming a mother again was overtaken by anxiety and fear… the thought of having another child brought me to tears.”\n“We decided to terminate the pregnancy. We lived in a country town in NSW so we had to drive to Sydney to a clinic where it would be performed surgically.\n“The morning after, I woke up and felt relieved. I knew I had done the right thing. I feel a little sad when my daughter asks for a baby brother or sister but in my heart, I know that I have only enough love for her.”\n- Eliza, 32", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:54:17.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
