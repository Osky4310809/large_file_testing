With Finn and Jake having fought vampires, wizards, and BMOs, Adventure Time has some of the greatest and most diverse array of villains of any TV show. Here are 7 of our favorites! Ice King \nWho could be more important to the Adventure Time mythos than the Ice King? He most clearly depicts the show’s heart and thesis: everyone is a human being inside, even a repulsive ice man who steals princesses. The character’s backstory is tragic — he was just a regular person driven mad by a crown — and the portrayal of princess stealing as a consequence of toxic nerd masculinity has been revolutionary for a children’s show. Orgalorg \nOrgalorg is the infinite cosmic being who comes along with the arrival of a comet because Princess Bubblegum failed to keep her throne in the candy kingdom. He came to absorb infinite knowledge and was forever hidden inside Gunter the Penguin. Look guys, he is cool and his story is cool. That's all there is to it. Tree Witch \nThe best of Adventure Time ’s one-off villains, the Tree Witch wants some princess hair to look beautiful and is going suck Jake into her bottomless bottom if she doesn’t get it. The story is actually a healthy allegory to show how to talk to someone you want to go out with, but on its surface, there’s a Tree Witch who wants hair to become gorgeous, so it's still dope af. King of Ooo and Toronto \nIt’s ridiculous how much the King of Ooo storyline predicted Donald Trump. A golden-haired con man beats a powerful type-A woman and proceeds to make a mess of things. Maybe that also means Trump is about to be dethroned by Crunchy the Cookie? Voiced by Andy Daly, the King of Ooo and his Paul Scheer-voiced squirrel sidekick Toronto are delightful. Above you'll see one of my favorite clips from Adventure Time , when the King of Ooo interacts with The Lich. Magic Man \nMagic Man is less a villain and more of, well, a jerk. He’ll trick you into a sickening scenario just to get his jollies — rarely does he ever have any grand master plans. Imagine an internet troll with powers. Not great! Ricardo \nRicardo is literally the Ice King’s heart, and he makes us all deeply uncomfortable. His face is real realistic and his goals are real sexual. Ricardo, get outta here! Your very presence ruins any room you’re in! Memow \nMemow is an assassin designed by a child who ended up being one of the more memorable villains on the show. A tiny kitten who hides inside Jake’s nose with a poison needle, Memow is a great character from back when the show was more about joyful silliness than drawing an intricate mythology out of silliness. \nAny great villains we missed?
