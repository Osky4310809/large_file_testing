In the photo, a toddler-aged Lourd is sitting on her mother’s lap in a limousine, parked in the middle of the woods. Fisher appears to be pointing out one of the wonders of nature to her daughter, and Lourd looks absolutely enthralled.\n✨ ✨ \nA post shared by Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on Feb 22, 2017 at 2:46pm PST \nShe captioned the photo with an angel emoji, which makes sense given what we know of Fisher and their incredibly close, powerful mother-daughter bond.\nLourd seems to have multiple special memories of traveling in limos with her mother as a child. Days after Fisher’s death — and of course, the death of Lourd’s grandmother, Debbie Reynolds, one day later — she posted a similar photo, adding in her caption that she was focusing on “finding the funny” again after so much tragedy.\n“If my life weren’t funny then it would just be true and that is unacceptable,” she wrote, quoting her mother’s book Wishful Drinking .\n\"If my life weren't funny then it would just be true and that is unacceptable\" -❤☪️ ️rrℹ️ Fℹ️ ♓️ r ❤Finding the funny might take a while but I learned from the best and her voice will forever be in my head and in my heart \nA post shared by Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on Jan 11, 2017 at 7:58pm PST \nWe hope she’s continuing to find the funny — and finding whatever solace she can in the happy memories she shared with her mother.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:50:54.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
