An October 2016 Molotov cocktail attack on a Swedish mosque by a Syrian national that caused no injuries and was hardly covered by Swedish media; A November 2016 attack in which a native of Chad opened fire with a BB gun at cops near the US embassy that injured no one and got little local attention. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said from the White House that the president only wanted to highlight the prevalence of terror attacks, and again repeated the claim that in some cases they did not get the coverage they deserved, without citing any specifics.\nHe did not elaborate on the purported “reasons” journalists had for minimizing coverage of terror attacks by ISIS and other radical groups.\nIn the San Bernardino attack , 14 people were killed and 22 seriously wounded when a married couple, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, targeted a local Department of Health Christmas party.\nFarook was a US-born citizen of Pakistani descent while Malik was a Pakistani-born legal resident.\nThey were both killed in a shootout with cops, and the atrocity generated wall-to-wall media coverage for weeks.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:46:38.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
