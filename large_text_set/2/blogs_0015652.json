Mayawati said, “He (Modi) does not know that BSP is a movement first and then a political party….I have dedicated my entire life for making members of dalit, deprived and weaker sections and Muslims stand on their feet.” (Source: PTI) \nIn sharp attack on Prime Minister Narednra Modi, BSP supremo Mayawati on Monday said that she remained unmarried her entire life to work for weaker sections of the society, especially Muslims, ANI reported. Mayawati said, “He (Modi) does not know that BSP is a movement first and then a political party….I have dedicated my entire life for making members of dalit, deprived and weaker sections and Muslims stand on their feet.” Mayawati further slammed Modi, and termed PM as “Mr Negative Dalit Man”. The BSP supremo said that Modi is idulged in “cheap things and petty talks”. “Perturbed at the rising popularity of the BSP, the prime minister is indulging in cheap things and indulging in petty talk about its supreme leader and has termed BSP as ‘Behenji Sampatti Party’ (Behenji Assets Party),” she said at an election rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Sultanpur. \nMayawati, who is popularly known as ‘Behenji’, said that Modi is an expert in ‘Jumlebaaji’. “He (Modi) is an expert in jumlebaazi (rhetoric) but when he will get a tit-for-tat reply he will forget all about it and today I have been compelled to do the same for him,” she said. “Narendra Damodardas Modi means Mr Negative Dalit Man, he is anti-dalit… This negative dalit man does not like that common people give small contributions in running the movement which is also run through donations,” Mayawati said. \nWatch: BJP Only Makes Fake Promises During Elections, Says Mayawati \nHer retort came soon after Modi, at an election rally in Orai region of Jalaun in Bundelkhand region, noted that BSP is no longer Bahujan Samaj Party. “…bahujan toh Mayawati me simat gaya hai…it is Behenji Sampatti Party now. Those who deposit wealth for themselves, can they solve your problem?” Modi asked.
