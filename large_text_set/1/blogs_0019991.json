Oyedepo informed the court that in line with its interim orders of Jan. 6, the EFCC had served same on Lawal. \nHe also informed the court that the order was also published in the Independence Newspaper of Jan. 12, in compliance with the orders of the court. \nIn response, counsel to Lawal, (Adeogun) confirmed the position, and added that he had filed a counter affidavit deposed to by Lawal, challenging the said forfeiture orders. \nArguing his application, he urged the court to issue an order, directing a refund of the sum of N9.08billion to his client on the grounds that same was obtained by coercion. \nHe argued that before such forfeiture orders could be made, two essential elements must be satisfied namely: “that the property in question is unclaimed, and that such property or funds forms proceeds of an unlawful act.’’ \nHe said: “We became aware of the forfeiture order when the interim order was served on us; My client was never confronted with these sets of facts during his incarceration at the EFCC. \n“After service of the orders, I requested for the statement of my client to the commission, but same was never given to me,” he said. \nHe argued that his client admitted having received the sum of 25 million dollars in clear dispensation of his duties, but was coerced by the commission to further admit receiving a total of 65 million dollars. \nAccording to him, the sum of 40 million dollars was therefore, taken as an overdraft from his bank to offset the alleged extra sum. \nHe therefore urged the court to order the immediate refund of the sum to his client. \nIn his reply, Oyedepo submitted that the tenure of Section 17 of the Advanced Fee Fraud and Other Related Offence Act made a property, which is reasonably suspected to be proceeds of crime forfeitable to the Federal Government. \n“Going by the facts and circumstances of this particular case, can it be said that the sum of N9.08 billion which is the naira equivalent of 40 million dollars was not reasonably suspected to form proceeds of a crime,” he queried. \nHe argued that Paragraph 4 of the applicant’s reply affidavit shows a meeting of the minds of some staff of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the respondent to launder funds. \n“My lord, Paragraph 4 of our reply affidavit shows a meeting of the minds of one Gbenga Komolafe, former group Managing Director, Crude Oil Marketing Division NNPC, Prince Haruna Momoh, former group Managing Director, Petroleum Product Marketing Company, Umar Farouk Ahmed, Group Managing Director, Nigerian Product Marketing Company and Dauda Lawal, to launder funds on behalf of former petroleum minister, Diezani Allison Madueke. \n“It will amount to contesting the obvious for Lawal to argue that he had no knowledge of the said sums,’’ he said. \nOyedepo argued that it was uncommon for a law enforcement agency like the EFCC to detain a person in its custody in perpetuity without an order of the court, adding that the statement of Lawal was lawfully obtained. \n“The respondent was duly cautioned before he voluntarily made his statement at the commission, and his lawyer even appended, his signature further attesting to the fact that the statements were obtained voluntarily. \n“So having freely volunteered a statement, he cannot urge my lord not to attach full probative value to his statement. \n“I submit that the appropriate order in the circumstance is for the court to order a final forfeiture of the sum of N9.08 billion already surrendered by the respondent, to the Federal Government. \nHe also urged the court to order the forfeiture of other sums to which no claim had been laid. \n“I urge the court to so hold,” he said. \nAfter listening to the submission of counsels, Justice Hassan fixed Feb. 16 for judgment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:31:26.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
