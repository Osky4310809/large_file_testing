They will analyse us and kill us if we don’t win.” \nThe City boss, though, insists he is revelling in the pressure, reminding the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool that they failed to even feature in this season’s competition. \nHe said: “It is amazing to be here again. To be here is not easy. People can think with City, England, the most prestigious football, the most media, most advertising in the world, that you have to be here. Radamel Falcao has been in sensational form this season (Photo: Reuters) \n“But a lot of big clubs are not here. You have to live with that situation.” \nCity face a formidable test against Monaco, who are three points clear of Paris St Germain in Ligue 1, scoring a staggering 76 goals in the process. \nGuardiola is well aware of the dangers posed by a rejuvenated Radamel Falcao and company.

A tough draw. A complete team. I’m looking forward to playing against them, seeing how is our level. \n“They are physically strong and the two strikers, Falcao and (Valere) Germain are fighters, they are killers in the box.” \nGuardiola confirmed Vincent Kompany is not available and says he will make a decision on the goalkeeper on the morning of the game although it is almost certain Willy Caballero will get the nod.
