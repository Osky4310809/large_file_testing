Amazon just netted the highest rating ever in the Harris Poll's Corporate Reputation Ranking, and to tip its cap to its loyal users and further burnish its corporate reputation, the world's biggest store is knocking $8.62 off any order of a $50 or more today. All you have to do to get the discount is enter the promo code BIGTHANKS at checkout. If you've had your eye on anything on Amazon or just need to stock up on household essentials, today is the day to do it. \nShop now at Amazon. \nMental Floss has affiliate relationships with certain retailers, including Amazon, and may receive a small percentage of any sale.
