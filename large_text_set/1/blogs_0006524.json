Granat, a psychotherapist who has worked with Olympic athletes.\n“They’ve been through quite a few head coaches and quite a few quarterbacks. The fans are down and the players are down. There is a hopelessness to the Jets. The feeling of hopelessness is one of the main things we see with depression.”\nGranat said several of his patients are ready to give up their season’s tickets, and one New York City cop who’s been in therapy for three years is mulling becoming a Dallas Cowboys fan to save his sanity.\nGranat said the 48-year-old starts off his sessions saying life “isn’t so good and the Jets are making it worse losing year after year after year.”\nThen there’s the 50-year-old engineer from New Jersey who has been in therapy for 20 years and uses his sessions to methodically break down the Jets’ flaws.\nAnother of Granat’s desperate patients yearns for third-string rookie quarterback Christian Hackenberg to take the team’s helm.\n“People are so frustrated,” the River Edge Ph.D. said. “They want to see something new. They want change and they want hope.”\nGetty Images Losses like the Jets’ 41-3 drubbing last week at the hands of the archrival New England Patriots can spread despair among the fan base.\n“People really identify with their teams. Wearing the colors. The tailgating. But there’s not much to celebrate. That affects their mood,” Granat said. “Sports can provide an outlet from work problems, economic problems, family problems and political problems,” he continued.\nGranat said his Jet-fan patients are “chipper” the Monday morning after a rare win, but “have a little less hop in their step” after another loss.\nStaten Island psychologist Angelo Contino has a patient who “wastes the first 10 minutes” of every session fuming about what the Jets “should have done” to avoid yet another brutal loss.\n“He’s convinced that if only he could call the plays, they’d do much better,” Dr. Contino said.\nAldo Fossella, a psychotherapist in practice for over 35 years, says the Jets are contributing to the crash-and-burn of one Staten Island marriage.\nA Wall Street guy in his 30s in weekly couples’ counseling since October “doesn’t communicate,” Fossella said.\nBut after the team was humiliated by the Colts, 41-10, on “Monday Night Football” recently, he became especially sullen.\nHis wife complained, “He’s moping around, and he’s taking it out on me. The Jets are ruining our marriage.”\nIn reality, it led to a breakthrough.\n“After exploring, he became aware. He realized and apologized,” Fossella said. “She wanted him to talk. That was a breakthrough.”\nFossella noted that the emotional investment — and the humiliating losses take their toll. “There’s a sense of, ‘You screwed me again.’ Like their best friend let them down. Anytime you go overboard in life in anything, you’re throwing things off balance.”\nGranat’s advice to sad-sack Jet followers? Switch teams.\n“It’s America. You are free to root for whatever team you like if it makes you feel better. Like a bad marriage, [you] don’t have to stay forever,” he said.\nThat’s easy for Granat to say. He’s a Giants fan.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T13:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T13:41:09.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
