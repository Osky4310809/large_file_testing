The brand-new boxing-inspired group fitness classes recently arrived in the Big Apple with a promise to help their attendees get strong and toned, one uppercut at a time. But don't worry if you've never picked up a pair of boxing gloves before as these classes are totally beginner-friendly.\nWhile we're definitely excited to sign up for our first Rumble class and throw some punches, we can't help but be a tad, er, distracted by the attractive array of people who work there. One glimpse of the gym's geotag on Instagram reveals that some similarly good-looking boxers regularly attend classes there as well.\nWe've decided to present you with the Sexy Men of Rumble Boxing — a handful of sweat-covered trainers, along with the gym's co-owner — to prove just how lovely an establishment it truly is. If these ripped hunks don't motivate you to get your butt to the gym (or to book a flight to NYC just to visit Rumble), then you may want to consider visiting an eye doctor.\nRelated:\nThis Video of Shirtless Jason Momoa Rock Climbing Deserves a \"Holy Sh*t\"\nPrevious Next", "external_links": ["https://www.rumble-boxing.com/", "https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/957072547746188/rumble/"], "published": "2017-03-15T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:02:13.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
