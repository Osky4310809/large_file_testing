The Northern Iowa guard was on no one’s radar until he buried a memorable three-pointer in 2010 to help the Panthers knock out top-seeded Kansas in one of the greatest upsets of all-time. \nWhether it's a player from a lesser-known mid-major or a player that has flown under the radar in a power conference, there's likely to be a Who's that guy? moment during the NCAA tournament's first weekend. \nHere are under-the-radar players who could boost their teams and drop jaws in the process. . Mike Daum, South Dakota State \nThe 6-9 sophomore forward averages 25.3 points a game — second in the nation — for the 16th-seeded Jackrabbits, who face No. 1 seed Gonzaga in the West Region. It’s too bad he’s going up against such a strong frontcourt, otherwise an upset would have been more likely. He had 51 points — the most by a Division I player this season — and 15 rebounds in a Feb. 18 win against Fort Wayne. Jawun Evans, Oklahoma State \nOklahoma State Cowboys guard Jawun Evans (1) plays defense against the Iowa State Cyclones at James H. Hilton Coliseum. (Photo: Reese Strickland, USA TODAY Sports) \nThe sophomore is one of the best point guards in this tournament and gives the 10th-seeded Cowboys a chance to take down one of the hottest teams in the country in Michigan. Evans, who averages 19 points and 6.2 assists a game, had 29 points in a losing effort vs. eventual Big 12 tournament champ Iowa State. Marcus Foster, Creighton \nCreighton Bluejays guard Marcus Foster (0) celebrates after defeating the Xavier Musketeers during the Big East Conference Tournament at Madison Square Garden. (Photo: Adam Hunger, USA TODAY Sports) \nFoster, a transfer from Kansas State, fits right into Greg McDermott’s system as an athletic guard with a knack for scoring — he’s averaging 18.3 points a game. And since starting point guard Maurice Watson Jr. was lost for the season, Foster’s production has been even more important. If the Bluejays advance to the second round, it’ll be because of Foster. Kyle Guy, Virginia \nVirginia Cavaliers guard Kyle Guy (5) gestures to the crowd after making a basket against the Syracuse Orange during the second half at the Carrier Dome. (Photo: Rich Barnes, USA TODAY Sports) \nThe freshman guard, who gained national attention for his man bun, has been an integral part of coach Tony Bennett’s ever-patient offense and nation-leading defense. He’s also been streaky, so a good performance will help the Cavaliers avoid the deadly 5-12 upset in a matchup with UNC-Wilmington. Canyon Barry, Florida \nFlorida Gators guard Canyon Barry (24) passes the ball against the Arkansas Razorbacks during the second half at Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center. (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports) \nBarry, a transfer from Charleston College and the son of NBA legend Rick Barry, is interesting for his free throw shooting more than anything else. The 6-6 guard, who was named SEC Sixth Man of the Year, shoots them underhanded — in \"granny\" fashion like his father famously did — and is ridiculously accurate, setting a school record for most consecutive free throws made (42). But he is also the second-leading scorer for the Gators and his outside shot is key for their chances to advance. Jimmy Hall, Kent State \nJimmy Hall of the Kent State Golden Flashes reacts after scoring against the Texas Longhorns. (Photo: Chris Covatta, Getty Images) \nThe 6-8 senior will have his hands full in a first-round matchup against UCLA. But Hall’s the type of player who can put a team on his back, crashing the glass and outhustling opponents. He averages a double-double with 18.9 points and 10.5 rebounds a game. \nMEET THE 68 NCAA TOURNAMENT TEAMS Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
