TCS is today the most powerful brand in global IT services... growing fast with a 12 per cent CAGR over the last five years,” he said. \nStating that TCS has a “well—articulated strategy” that has guided it to leadership position, he said the company needs to accelerate to “stay a step ahead of the fast changing world“. \n“In every industry, the technology leverage is increasing and we will use our scale and expertise to drive growth. Our customers are now competing on a time horizon of weeks and days and internally, we have to do the same to stay relevant to them,” he added. \nGopinathan said TCS’ contextual knowledge of clients’ systems and processes, combined with proficiency in new technologies, will position it ahead of pure play technology or consulting companies. \n“At the heart of this journey will be our willingness and ability to embrace new knowledge continuously. We can be proud that more than 2 lakh TCSers have leveraged the Digital Learning platform,” he said. \nThanking Chandrasekaran for his leadership and mentorship, Gopinathan said TCS will have the benefit of his counsel as the key executive now takes over as Chairman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:30:20.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
