Leicester parted company with Ranieri last week \n\"Players are not more powerful. We were much more powerful in the past,\" Klopp said. \n\"It depends always on the board. As long as the players talk together there is no problem. It is not about how powerful [the players are]. Kasper Schmeichel says Leicester players didn't meet with the club's owners to discuss Claudio Ranieri's future \n\"The players need to be powerful but not in sacking managers. It's not like the Leicester players did it. It is if someone asked, they gave an answer. \n\"If there is a direct way to the board the owners sit with the players and ask 'how are you?' and they say 'not too good because of the manager'. I have never had this situation. There was never a direct line to the owner. But I know it has happened.\" Leicester vs Liverpool", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:00:24.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
