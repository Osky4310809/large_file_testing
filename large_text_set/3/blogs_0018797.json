(L-R)Tboss, DebbieRise, Bassey and Bally for eviction \nHowever, Efe, who won the ‘Ultimate Head of House’ (HoH) on Monday night, was given powers by Biggie to nominate four housemates for possible eviction scheduled for Sunday March 26. \nEfe did not understood initially the full weight of his title when he won the task and became the Ultimate HoH during the last eviction show until Biggie asked him to single-handedly pick the housemates for eviction. \nThe task proved to be a difficult one as he had trouble picking housemates for eviction prompting Biggie to ask housemates to make a pitch to Efe. \nAll the housemates had to pitch themselves to him, giving him reasons why he should not pick them. \nThey were given sixty seconds each to state reasons why they should not be nominated by Efe. \nTboss stated that although she was almost nine years older than he is, they have found common ground and she has changed his (Efe’s) perception about light skinned women. \nMarvis had little to say and explained that she is as real as they come and she is also his Big Brother wife while DebbieRise said she carries everyone along and she is in the competition for her family. \nBassey acknowledged that they have had differences but at the same time, they have also been able to sort themselves out most of the time, adding that he is somebody Efe can trust while Bally reminded him of their friendship. \nBisola simply said that she met him for advice sometimes and they share same philosophy. “let us go to the finals together’’, she pleaded. \nEfe was called to the diary room afterwards to make his choices during which he picked Tboss, Bally, Bassey and DebbieRise. \nHe was however unsettled as he felt it was a set – up which he would pay dearly for. \nSo far, the nomination power is the only known advantage of the Ultimate Head of House title as Big Brother is yet to announce others. \nAt the end of the day, the quartet of Bassey, Tboss, DebbieRise and Bally were picked by Efe for possible eviction while his closest friends Marvis and Bisola were excluded. \nEfe explained that he picked them “based on logistics”.
