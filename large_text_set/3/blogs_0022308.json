Some people think that’s just as important as healthcare,” said Trump during a speech in Louisville, Kentucky Monday night.\nClick here to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations. \nTrump went on to call the U.S. medicine prices “outrageous,” especially when compared to identical products in other countries. “Why? You know why? Campaign contributions. Who knows. But somebody’s getting very rich. Medicine prices will be coming down. Way, way, way down,” he said.\nThis has become a common refrain with Trump, who has demanded lower drug prices in the U.S. in exchange for laxer Food and Drug Administration regulations and lower corporate taxes. But while a more-than-3% drop in a big ETF is notable, many of the largest biotech and pharma companies aren’t suffering as big losses this time around. Consider: big pharma companies shed some $25 billion in market value in 20 minutes during Trump’s January press conference when he said the industry is “getting away with murder” on drug prices. Major firms like Celgene , AbbVie , and Bristol-Myers Squibb fell anywhere from 3.5% to 5.5% then; on Tuesday, they saw far more modest declines ranging from 0.6% to 1.5%.\nSo it’s possible that some Wall Street investors are beginning to take Trump’s rhetoric with a grain of salt. However, if he were to endorse specific, tangible legislation like that presented to him by Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings earlier this month --which Trump allegedly has signaled early support for --the market effects could become far more pronounced.\nTrump has previously promoted direct drug price negotiations with Medicare and the importation of cheaper medicines from overseas.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:26:15.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
