PHOTOS: Melania Trump’s ‘Hot Pink’ Red Cross Gala Ball Gown Published Updated 10:52 pm EST, February 4, 2017 2 Comments By Jessica McBride 33.2k Share Tweet Follow US First Lady Melania Trump arrives for the 60th Annual Red Cross Gala at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on February 4, 2017. (Getty) \nFirst Lady Melania Trump again showcased her fashion style at the annual Red Cross Ball in Palm Beach Florida – this time wearing hot pink. \nThe First Lady and President Donald Trump, who wore a tuxedo, reunited at their palatial Mar-a-Lago estate.

(Getty) \nMelania and the president strolled hand-in-hand at the ball; until Florida, they had not been photographed together since the day after the inauguration, sparking speculation about their relationship. However, they were photographed both at the airport – where FLOTUS greeted POTUS – and at the gala. \n“The gala has a history at Mar-a-Lago: The estate’s first owner, Marjorie Meriweather Post, hosted the first Red Cross Ball there in 1957,” reported the Palm Beach Post . “Since then, it has been held at Mar-a-Lago and The Breakers, with Trump playing host several times throughout the years.” \nCBS News reported that the Red Cross “is offering aid to those affected by Trump’s moratorium on the U.S. refugee program.” \nAccording to the newspaper, Trump paused as he entered the ball to address a federal judge’s temporary restraining order halting his immigration ban, which the White House is appealing. \n“We’ll win,” he said, according to the Post. “For the safety of the country, we’ll win.” Outside the estate, anti-Trump protests erupted.

However, in Palm Beach, she brought out the color, while sticking to the Melania fashion code. Simple. Elegant. Monochrome. (Getty) \nMelania started the vacation wearing red.
