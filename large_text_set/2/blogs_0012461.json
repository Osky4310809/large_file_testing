[Vice President Mike Pence ] can’t be president as he, too, was elected under this same fraud.” \n“The court has to rule either that the President is the winner of the popular vote OR the election must be held over,” he concluded. “The Republicans– the beneficiaries of this treason –cannot be allowed to hold on to the power by default. If it turns out there’s a traitor in the White House, the judicial branch must find a fair, peaceful way to un-do and then re-do the election of 2016.” \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:22:38.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
