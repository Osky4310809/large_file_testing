Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nA lot of President Donald Trump’s critics — self-proclaimed comics especially —sure like to emulate him when going after him and other Republicans. Stage all the fainting spells you want over a decade-old clip from “Access Hollywood,” but the effect is lost pretty quickly when you “go high” like this, as Michelle Obama attempted to describe it. Happy international women's day. @realDonaldTrump , a special congrats to all the int'l pussies that have been assaulted by you. \n— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 8, 2017 \nAs everyone knows, Sen. Ted Cruz and family recently had dinner at the White House, which triggered poor Keith Olbermann, who was shocked that Cruz would allow his children to be used as props for Dear Leader . So, the two have seemed to have moved on from the ugliness of the campaign, which is commendable. \nWe’re not going to defend the time candidate Donald Trump retweeted an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz, but TV personality Chelsea Handler doesn’t seem to think it’s wrong to drag spouses into it — can’t let the week end with Samantha Bee getting all the coverage, maybe. I can't believe @tedcruz wife still fucks him. Is anyone fucking @SpeakerRyan ? Oh, right. @MitchMcConell takes care of that. \n— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 11, 2017 \nPut some caution tape around Chelsea Handler’s Twitter feed STAT, because that is some sharp-edged humor. Hey everyone, @chelseahandler is making \"gay jokes\" about @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr . She wants you to clap. \n— Chet Cannon (@Chet_Cannon) March 11, 2017 @chelseahandler @tedcruz @SpeakerRyan not too helpful to use their homophobia as an insult. Kinda makes homosexuality look bad still. \n— Anthony Nardo (@OuchMyNardz) March 11, 2017 @chelseahandler @tedcruz @SpeakerRyan @MitchMcConell Honestly, how is this less crass than the things you protest others saying? \n— Roger C (@floplag) March 11, 2017 @chelseahandler dude chill. How is this helpful to anyone? It's just rude and nasty. \n— Lilith Heresy (@LilithHeresy) March 11, 2017 . @chelseahandler wow you really got them good there do u think they'll resign \n— Brad M. (@bmast39) March 11, 2017 @chelseahandler @tedcruz @SpeakerRyan @MitchMcConell fantastic analysis this totally makes me want to support your cause #howtrumpwon \n— Scurrilous Dog (@Scottymcmahon22) March 11, 2017 @chelseahandler @tedcruz @SpeakerRyan this is vile, even for you.
