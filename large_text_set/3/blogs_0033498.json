Liverpool need a win to continue their push for the top four, while Everton have an outside chance of gate-crashing the Champions League places too. \nThey'll need to turn a blind eye to history, though, with the Blues winless at Anfield since 1999. Indeed, they haven't won against their old foes in 13 attempts. But if they end that record on Saturday, they'll be just three points behind the Reds. \nDave Usher (Liverpool) and Luke O'Farrell (Everton) do battle in the 50-50 challenge. \nWhat's at stake here? \nDave Usher: A lot. Securing a place in the top four is Liverpool's primary objective. But a defeat on Saturday would not only be a damaging blow to their hopes of Champions League qualification, it would cut their lead over their neighbours to just three points and give Everton every confidence of overhauling the Reds. \nThis is Liverpool's most difficult remaining fixture, and if they can come through it unscathed, it would set them up for the run in. There's far more pressure on the Reds this weekend, as Everton have nothing to lose and everything to gain. \nLuke O'Farrell: Beyond the usual stakes attached to matches against your local rivals, the proximity of the two teams in the table at this stage of the season means this is the most important league derby in recent seasons. Both teams are eyeing European football, and just six points and three league places separate the teams ahead of Saturday's 228th Merseyside derby. A return of 23 points from a possible 30 in 2017 has Everton as the form team in the division in 2017. This confidence and positivity has to transmit to team selection and overall approach. There can be no repeat of the cowering Anfield displays served up across the past two decades. Everton travel to Anfield on Saturday harbouring hopes of gate-crashing the top four. \nWhat on earth is Everton's problem with Anfield? \nDU: Liverpool have usually, though not always, had a better side than Everton, so that's part of it. However, lots of inferior sides have picked up wins at Anfield over the years, so it's clearly more than that, and some of it has to be psychological. There have been times when Everton have gone into this fixture riding the crest of a wave and in much better form than the Reds, yet they've frozen like a rabbit in the headlights. \nEven when everything has looked to be in their favour, they've just retreated into their shell and been unable to perform. The prime example of that was in 2006, when Steven Gerrard was sent off early on but Everton didn't seem to have any idea what to do and meekly lost 3-1. Sometimes teams just have a \"bogey ground,\" and for Everton, that has been Anfield. They will break their hoodoo, eventually; though I just hope it isn't this weekend. \nLO: Anfield derbies are the stuff of nightmares for the blue half of Merseyside. Even when in good form, the capacity to self-destruct on this ground suggests an inferiority complex. Since Kevin Campbell scored the only goal to settle a bad-tempered encounter in September 1999, the short journey across Stanley Park has yielded 17 miserable, winless outings. While David Moyes attracted criticism for a depressingly cautious approach leading to embarrassing defeats against a succession of mediocre Liverpool sides, Roberto Martinez seemed to arrive with no plan at all and lost two of his three Anfield trips 4-0. Years of Everton teams looking beaten before the first whistle has to stop. Everton have not won at Anfield since Kevin Campbell's winner in a 1-0 victory back in 1999. \nAdam Lallana vs. Seamus Coleman: Who is the bigger miss? \nDU: I'm obviously going to say Lallana, but that's not to take anything away from Coleman, who is an excellent player. He seems like a really nice lad too, so hopefully he'll make a full and swift recovery from that horrific injury. \nAs good a player as he is, though, he's still a right-back, a position more easily replaced than that of a player such as Lallana, who is vital to what Liverpool do both with and without the ball. \nLO: Earlier in the season, when Coleman struggled for consistency and Lallana delivered seven goals and seven assists in 17 matches, the Liverpool man would be the obvious answer to this question. However, while his performances remain at a high level, Lallana has no goals or assists in 10 Premier League appearances in 2017. This drop in direct contributions and Coleman rediscovering his form since the turn of the year tips the balance toward the Everton right-back ahead of the derby. Everton are short on alternatives, especially those capable of matching a tireless work rate that allows him to do the work of two players on the right flank. His tireless running from the full-back position has allowed Ross Barkley to impress in a nominal right-wing position. Sadio Mane scored as Liverpool beat Everton 1-0 in the corresponding fixture at Goodison Park. \nSadio Mane vs. Romelu Lukaku: Who would you rather have? \nDU: Mane, even though I would not dispute that Lukaku is the better player. The Everton man is terrific and can be virtually unstoppable on his day, but his game is not necessarily suited to Jurgen Klopp's high-pressing, high-intensity style of play. Mane, on the other hand, fits Liverpool like, to coin a Klopp expression, an \" arse in a bucket .\" So it's Mane. But if Liverpool were managed by someone other than Klopp, I'd almost certainly take Lukaku. \nLO: Mane would be a welcome addition to an Everton midfield lacking a reliable goal scorer, but it is impossible to argue against Lukaku. Top scorer in the division and in the form of his career, he has been the driving force behind recent resurgence, scoring 11 and assisting three more in 10 league appearances in 2017. If copious self-belief used to create a mismatch between Lukaku's ability and his own views on what he is capable of, this campaign has aligned the two. Those days of supporters questioning his worth to the team appear over: The Belgian has been directly involved in 53 percent of Everton's 51 league goals this season (21 goals, 6 assists). \nWhat would a result do for your season? \nDU: Three points on Saturday would not only keep Liverpool well in the hunt for the top four, it would virtually kill off any chance of them being caught by Everton. The other top four contenders will all take points off each other between now and May, so if Liverpool can keep winning, they could even finish as high as second. A defeat this weekend would probably put paid to that though. \nLO: An overdue win at Anfield would put Everton firmly in the Champions League picture and move the Blues to within three points of their neighbours. As the first of four remaining matches against teams above them in the table, this would mark a statement of intent and provide a significant confidence boost for upcoming matches against Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea. Defeat would likely end the Champions League conversation for this season, while a draw is not enough at this stage. Romelu Lukaku is the league's leading scorer with 21 goals. \nPrediction \nDU: 1-1. With so much at stake for both teams, it promises to be a close one. And without Lallana, I'm not sure Liverpool will have enough to win, so I'm expecting a draw. \nLO: 1-1. A score draw that neither team really needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:33:02.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
