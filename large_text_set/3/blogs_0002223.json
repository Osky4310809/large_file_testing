Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, released the following statement after President Donald Trump signed a new executive order today instructing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rescind the Clean Water Rule. \n“In Massachusetts we may sing about ‘that dirty water’, but thanks to Donald Trump’s new executive order, millions of Americans may have to drink it. Rolling back the Clean Water Rule will only expose local communities and economies to the dangerous water pollution that threatens the environment and public health. Tourism, recreation, agriculture and other economic engines of growth in Massachusetts need clean water to flourish. \n“This announcement is just the latest in Donald Trump’s giveaways to polluters and corporate interests at the expense American families and the environment. When he’s not threatening EPA’s budget, Donald Trump is instructing the agency to undermine its own mission. I will continue to fight Trump administration efforts to jeopardize our clean lands, air and water.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T06:17:23.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
