There are RARE owls there that need to be left alone. There are also numerous other bird species that use this place to nest. There is a Monarch habitat with hundreds of Monarchs that go there on their way to Mexico each year and numerous other species of plant and animal that will be destroyed if this happens. This is a gem of a place for wildlife and we cannot allow this to happen! This is not just some little useless space to build on, there are many species that are rare here and depend on this land!
