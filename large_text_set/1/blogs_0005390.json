If you allow me to sing ‘strange fruit' a song that has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the United States for being too controversial. A song that speaks to all the disregarded and down trodden black people in the United States. A song that is a reminder of how love is the only thing that will conquer all the hatred in this world, then I will graciously accept your invitation and see you in Washington.\" \nWow!! \nHere's the full tweet (below): \nInauguration ceremony \n— Rebecca Ferguson (@RebeccaFMusic) January 2, 2017 \nFor those who don't know, Strange Fruit is a song that was originally a poem — written by Abel Meeropol — that deals with lynchings of African-Americans in the 20th century in the United States. \nIt was first recorded as a song by Billie Holliday , and later also recorded by others, including Nina Simone . \nHere's Holliday singing it (below): \nPowerful!! \nGood for Ferguson for standing her ground on that statement — something tells us her words here make it doubtful that she'll actually be performing at the inauguration, after all. \nNo word yet from the Trump camp on this, or any other inauguration performers. \nFor what it's worth, Trump himself is tweeting about nuclear war this Monday afternoon (below): \nNorth Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 \nUh-oh. \nWell, at least Ferguson took a stand !! \n[ Image via TNYF/Daniel Deme/ WENN . ] 17 Stars To Watch In 2017! Things To Look Forward To In 2017!
