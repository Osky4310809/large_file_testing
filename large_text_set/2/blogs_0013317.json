The carnival kicks off within 20 seconds of the opening track and allows only the most fleeting of (Barack Obama-narrated) sit-downs as the extent of their ambition is joyously unfurled. It’s the sound of a band liberated: free to recruit Beyoncé for vocal duties on the euphoric “Hymn for the Weekend”, trade sweet nothings with Tove Lo for “Fun”’s hazy holiday romance jam and talk Noel Gallagher into a (What’s The Story) Morning Glory? -sized guitar solo on the hymnal “Up&Up”. Customer Reviews by CsBence93 If you take aside the fact that this is a Coldplay album, and the music they made in the past, this material can even be diverse and entertaining - just don't expect the well-known Coldplay sound on it. appaling by used to be a big fan what a complete load of rubbish! i used to be a big fan. where is an instrument? it’s all mushed up rubbish. the last album i forgave as a wandering. this is too much. cheap con trick. get back to basics boys.
