Julia and I talked about it recently, and she thought it would be an amazing idea.” \n“My Best Friends Wedding,” distributed by Sony Pictures, grossed $300 million worldwide, created the template for the modern-day gay best friend (see Rupert Everett ’s George Downes) and reignited Roberts’ box office reign in the late ’90s (with the help of “Notting Hill” and “Runaway Bride”). In 2001, producer Jerry Zucker said a second film, tentatively titled “My Best Friend’s Divorce,” was unlikely. But that hasn’t stopped speculation about such a project, with Entertainment Weekly and Film School Rejects both endorsing the idea. \nMulroney said a possible premise for a sequel would have his character Michael still married to Kimmy (Cameron Diaz) when Julianne (Roberts) resurfaces to snatch him back. “Wouldn’t that be the fun thing to see?” he asked. “I don’t know. You tell me. Whatever it is, as far as I’m concerned, it’s been in development for 16 years.” Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:41:15.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
