File photo Higher outflows, gold revaluation \nMANILA, Philippines – The country’s foreign exchange buffer in December narrowed to its thinnest level in 11 months amid strong outflows as well as the revaluation adjustments on the gold holdings of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). \nBSP Governor Amando Tetangco Jr. said the country’s gross international reserves (GIR) thinned for the third straight month to $81.04 billion in December from the revised $81.45 billion in November. \nThe level was the lowest since January last year when the GIR amounted to $80.69 billion. The foreign exchange buffer has declined for the third straight month after hitting a record high $86.14 billion in September. \nThe amount was also slightly lower than the $80.666 billion booked in December 2015. The BSP also missed the revised GIR target of $83.7 billion. \nTetangco said the decline was mainly due to outflows arising from payments made by the national government for its maturing foreign exchange obligations. \nHe also cited the foreign exchange operations of the BSP as well as the revaluation adjustments on the central bank’s gold holdings due to lower price of gold in the international market. \nThe value of the central bank’s gold holdings declined 1.9 percent to $7.26 billion in December from $7.4 billion in November, while the value of its foreign investments slipped to $68.6 billion from $68.93 billion. \nEarnings from its foreign exchange operations inched up 2.1 percent to $3.6 billion from the revised $3.52 billion. \nThe GIR is the sum of all foreign exchange flowing into the country. The reserves serve as buffer to ensure the Philippines would not run out of foreign exchange it could use to pay for imported goods and services, or maturing obligations in case of external shocks. \nIf it deems necessary, the BSP buys dollars from the foreign exchange market to prevent sharp depreciation of the peso. It can also sell to avoid sharp appreciation of the local currency. \nThe peso depreciated around six percent last year, making it the second worst- performing currency in the region next to the Chinese yuan. The local currency flirted with the 50 to $1 level several times. \nDespite the decline, Tetangco said the GIR level could cover 9.2 months’ worth of imports of goods and payments of services and income. \nHe added the GIR is also equivalent to 5.8 times the country’s short-term external debt based on original maturity and 4.2 times based on residual maturity. \nFor this year, the BSP sees the GIR hitting $84.7 billion, equivalent to 8.8 months import cover. \nGlobal financial markets remained volatile due to the interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve as well as the uncertainties about the policies of US president-elect Donald Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T05:08:06.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
