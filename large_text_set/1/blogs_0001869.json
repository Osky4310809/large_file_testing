The matter was placed before the cabinet under a Supreme Court ruling that the actual government (decision-making authority) was the cabinet and not the chief minister or the secretary of a department. \nAccording to Mr Khan, those having permits will be able to hunt the houbara bustard with falcons. There was no permission to hunt the birds with firearms or net them. The permission is allowed every year and the method is prescribed to limit the hunting. \nThe wildlife department has already allowed the hunting from Dec 1 to Jan 31. There are seven special permit holders — three Qatari royals, three UAE rulers and a Saudi minister. Each permit carries a daily allowance of 10 houbara bustards. \nThe Qatari royals are allowed hunting in Khushab, Bhakkar and Jhang, those from the UAE in Rahim Yar Khan, Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur. Chakwal was reportedly allotted to the Saudi interior minister, Mr Khan said, adding that the ‘guests’ worked for the betterment of local communities during their stay here. They had so far completed 251 welfare projects and recently inaugurated a 50-bed hospital, he said. \nPublished in Dawn, January 1st, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T06:26:15.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
