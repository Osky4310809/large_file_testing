Garry Monk plays down prospect of signing new Leeds United deal Monk’s one-year deal expires in June and the club have yet to open talks over new terms Share Garry Monk's one-year deal at Elland Road expires in June (Photo: Action Images) Share   \nGarry Monk is determined not to let the uncertainty over his Elland Road future derail Leeds’ promotion bid. \nMonk’s one-year deal expires in June and the club have yet to open talks over new terms, despite co-owner Andrea Radrizzani insisting he wants him to stay. \nThe former Swansea boss has transformed Leeds this season and fans are increasingly uneasy over the lack of progress over a new contract. \nMonk, 38, does not want speculation over his future to affect the team and says it would be “selfish” of him to discuss it at this key time. \n“I’m not going to talk about that situation, I don’t need to,” he said when quizzed about a new contract before today’s clash with QPR at Elland Road.

That’s the only bit. \n“You guys, I will tell you the first if there’s any news on that side of it, but that will obviously be when I have sat down and spoke to the club. \n“For me, it’s selfish of me to think about myself. It’s important that I think about my players and my staff and this club.” \nMonk sees today’s game as a measuring stick for Leeds’ progress under him after they were outclassed by Rangers 3-0 at Loftus Road on the opening weekend of the season.

At the weekend we want to show how far we have come. We will have another big crowd and our passionate fans behind us.” \nRob Green will make his 600th league appearance today and Monk praised the former England goalkeeper for his longevity after being written off. \n“It’s a fantastic achievement,” he said. “It just shows what a great professional he is and what a great career he’s had. \n“He has been vitally important. He’s a good goalkeeper and that’s why I wanted to bring him here.” poll loading Should Garry Monk sign a new deal at Leeds United? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T18:34:48.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
