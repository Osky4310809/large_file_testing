Liverpool \nMust like this competition, made good saves particularly from Tadic. \nAlexander-Arnold 7 \nLooks an outstanding prospect, cool and composed. Very comfortable on the ball. Liverpool's Loris Karius saves from Southampton's Dusan Tadic (Photo: Reuters) \nLovren 6 \nOf all the former Saints, he’s the one the travelling fans boo the loudest. \nMatip 6 \nHis return was welcome, looked assured in the heart of Liverpool’s defence. \nMilner 6 \nHis usual self: solid, reliable and some good set pieces. \nHenderson 6 \nNot at his sharpest, but worked and tried hard as well as driving forward. \nCan 6 \nHis recent performances have been under heavy scrutiny. Went close. \nLallana 6 \nWorked hard, tried to make things happen from midfield. Good. \nCoutinho 7 \nBright and lively, the feel good factor of his new contract showed in his early play. \nFirmino 6 \nLively and energetic but just could not connect on a frustrating night. Liverpool's Roberto Firmino shoots at goal (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nSturridge 7 \nWas lively around the box and tested Forster. Glimpses of his better form. \nSubs: Mignolet, Moreno, Lucas, Origi, Klavan, Woodburn, Wijnaldum Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge shoots over the bar (Photo: Reuters) Southampton \nNearly dropped a clanger as he spilled Can’s shot. What a let off. \nCedric 7 \nAnother good performance as he defended and stuck to his task. \nYoshida 7 \nStood firm under heavy aerial pressure into the box. Good, solid display. \nStephens 7 \nSouthampton fans sing the Harry Kane one of our song for him. They like him.

One of the unsung heroes of the Premier League, such a consistent player. \nWard-Prowse 6 \nQuick and tenacious in Southampton’s midfield. Hooked early. \nDavis 7 \nBlasted over one big chance but a good industrious midfield display. Shane Long fires home the winner for Southampton (Photo: REUTERS) \nTadic 6 \nWent desperately close to scoring, saw his effort blocked by Karius’s legs. \nRedmond 7 \nVery dangerous on the counter attack, carried Southampton’s threat. \nRodriguez 5 \nHooked at half time after he really struggled to get into the game. \nSubstitutes \nLong, for Rodriguez, 46 mins, 6 \nHojbjerg, for Ward-Prowse, 58 mins, 6 \nSubs: Lewis, Clasie, Long, Martina, Hojbjerg, McQueen, Sims Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:57:05.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
