Julianne Hough told Viall after his dance that he had \"pancake feet,\" while Len Goodman referred to the reality TV mainstay's moves as \"disjointed.\" The Weirdest ‘Bachelor’ and ‘Bachelorette’ Job Titles Ever! \nViall tells Us that he appreciates the judges' \"critical feedback\" and hopes that he can \"make some improvements.\" He adds, \"I was just trying to have fun, and it was very surreal.

In fact, he says he \"definitely [felt] more comfortable\" knowing that the special-education teacher, 29, was cheering him on from the front row. As for what Grimaldi told him after his cha-cha, Viall reveals, \"She just said, 'Good job.' I haven't really gotten a chance to talk to her, but she's going to be very supportive.\" You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:58:30.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
