They are testament of selfless leadership, valor and bravery of great men and women who have contributed significantly to the development of mankind. \n“As we all know, this magnificent monument was erected in memory of a valiant woman, Madam Efunroye Tinubu, the first Iyalode of Egbaland and one of the greatest merchants of colonial Lagos. \n“It is a celebration of her exploits in the business world and contribution to the foremost status to which our State has attained in the world of commerce and for us as a government and in line with our administration’s commitment to harness the tourism potentials of our State, historical monuments such as this will continue to be given a face lift and outlook.” \nThe Governor, however, appealed for the cooperation of residents in ensuring the protection of the site against vandalization and distortion of its historical and tourism value, saying that it was the collective responsibility of all to preserve the rich cultural and historical heritage in the State for the present generation and generations yet unborn. \nIn his remarks, Sole Administrator of Lagos Island East Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Hon Abiola Are said the upgrade of Tinubu Square was a demonstrable evidence of the clear vision and passion of Governor Ambode for development and preservation of historical heritage in the State and urged the people to continue to support the Governor. \nHe recalled the dilapidated state of the site before the intervention of the Governor, saying that it was a good thing that the government was thinking in such direction. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T02:05:32.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
