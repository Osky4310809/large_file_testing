Dave Chapelle: Two Cities, One Event features back-to-back sets filmed in Austin, Texas and Los Angeles, California, filmed over the last few years. They appear to be showcasing a rousing return to form. The new trailer for the special teases Chappelle’s command of the stage and the crowd, aptly soundtracked to A Tribe Called Quest’s terrific political anthem “We the People.” \nAs for topics covered, this snippet doesn’t give away too much (aside from a few bits, including an unsurprisingly great O.J. joke). We’ll have to wait until March 21, when Two Cities, One Even t launches on Netflix, to see what subjects the ever-shrewd Chappelle tackles. \nDavid Canfield is a Brow Beat intern. \n‘,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T19:24:45.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
