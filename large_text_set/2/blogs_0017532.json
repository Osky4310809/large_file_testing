I said I don't know, I have eaten nothing all day. So I might give it a go later on. \n“As I say what is that, Sun Bet had us at 8-1 to eat a pie. I thought I would give them a bit of banter and do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down. \n“I went and got it at half time from the kitchen, I had it all prepared and ready to go. It was meat and potato.” \nAsked if anyone he knew backed the offer, Shaw answered: “I think there were a few people. Obviously we are not allowed to bet. I think a few of the mates and a few of the fans. It was just a bit of banter for them. It is something to make the occasion as well and you can look back and say it was part of it and we got our ticket money back.” \nMore to follow...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:43:39.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
