(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) \nROME—The Philippines wants Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founding chairman Jose Maria “Joma” Sison removed from the United States’ terror list, which would allow him to travel anywhere without fear of being arrested, chief negotiator and Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said on Wednesday. \nSison’s removal from the list would be included in the joint statement that the government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, the rebels’ political wing, were expected to issue at the end of the third round of peace talks later Wednesday, Bello said. \n“It is important for Joma to be able to go to the Philippines,” Bello said, adding that the government panel would communicate the request directly to Washington. “We have our basis considering that he is in the peace talks.” ADVERTISEMENT \nRemoving Sison from the list would allow him to travel anywhere without fear of being arrested while performing his duties as a consultant to the peace negotiations. This includes returning to the Philippines after living in exile in the Netherlands since 1987. \nChief communist negotiator Fidel Agcaoili said they welcomed the government move, but said the delisting should also include the CPP and its armed wing, the New People’s Army, which were included in the list in 2002. \nThe delisting would facilitate the meeting between President Duterte and Sison in a foreign, neutral country, Bello said, without giving specifics. — KARLOS MANLUPIG/ac", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:11:13.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
