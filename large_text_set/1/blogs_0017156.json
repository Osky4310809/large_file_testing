The latest excuse was that his gates had stuck but he couldn’t jump over a fence that was four feet six inches high. \n“There has been too much indiscipline at this club for way too long. Not in 20 years of management have I gone down this road of publicly shaming a player but I have to make a stand because I won’t put up with it. Not on my watch.” \nThe Scot has scored just three times in 22 games since his arrival and has struggled for fitness this term, first under Roberto Di Matteo and now under Bruce. The Scot's impact has been minimal since his £12million arrival (Photo: BPI/REX/Shutterstock) Steve Bruce is looking to change the culture at Villa Park (Photo: Aston Villa FC/Getty Images) Read More Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce closing in on £5million Barnsley double swoop \nThe Villa chief is unhappy at what he perceives as a lack of discipline running throughout the club, and is seeking to change the culture at Bodymoor Heath. \nBruce is eager to sign Barnsley duo Conor Hourihane and James Bree, following up the £3million arrival of Henri Lansbury, as he seeks players hungry to learn and fire the club back into the Premier League. \nOffloading McCormack’s £45,000-plus wages and recouping a portion of the club’s initial outlay may prove difficult however, while the club also need to persuade the 30-year-old - who signed a four-year deal in the summer - that his future lies elsewhere. poll loading Will Aston Villa win promotion to the Premier League? 6000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T19:17:59.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
