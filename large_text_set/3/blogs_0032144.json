Jiang Zhipeng \nChinese newspapers called the 1-0 match, a FIFA World Cup Asian qualifier, a “nightmare” showing for the national side. \nAngry fans found a scapegoat, when Jiang’s wife revealed on social media that he had recently filed for divorce. \n“For nearly three-and-a-half years out of our four-year marriage, he was sleeping with other women and now he is trying to drive me to an early grave,” Zhang Zhiyue wrote. \nShe posted photos of Jiang snuggling with his alleged mistress, and begged the Chinese football association and the sports bureau of Guangdong province to “expel” him from professional football. \nMany fans agreed: “His character is horrible. Kick him out of national football,” one commenter wrote. \nChinese soccer authorities have not commented on the allegations. \nThe disgraced 28-year-old made his debut for the national team in 2013 and has been a popular player for the Guangzhou Chinese Super League club since 2014. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T14:24:09.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
