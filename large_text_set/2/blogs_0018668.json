But does team ownership even care? \n“My level of doubt is zero,” Desmond told me. \nBridich also took a calculated risk by acquiring Greg Holland, who saved 125 games for the Kansas City Royals from 2013-15, in the belief he could recover from Tommy John surgery, regaining both his velocity and his dominance as a reliever. \nIf both bold moves of Bridich pay off, there will be playoff baseball at Coors Field in October. \nIf the moves flop, then they will be the same old Rockies, and we can again forget about them when the Broncos open training camp in July. \nIn the quest to get back to the World Series for the first time since 2007, what the Rockies have done is stolen the blueprint of Kansas City, which won a championship two years ago with a combination of undeniable athleticism, sterling defense and an intimidating bullpen. \nHow does a long-suffering franchise know when it’s ready to win big? Royals general manager Dayton Moore explained it to me like this: “It takes two to four years of playing every single day at the major-league level to become a consistent producer. But once your players get there, you’ve got to do everything you can to support their efforts and win a world championship. … You just know instinctively when it’s time. You don’t necessarily put it in the computer and let it say: ‘OK, now you’ve got to do it. You’ve got to win now.’ ” \nAfter two years of learning on the job and carefully nurturing talent in the farm system, Bridich is ready to roll. Although Bridich is still more than six months shy of his 40th birthday, it’s time to take off the training wheels. The Rockies’ time is now. Maybe you can’t rush success. But opportunity seldom knocks twice. \nIf Kansas City can compete for the World Series crown, then certainly it can happen in Denver, right? \nNothing less than Bridich’s legacy is riding on the answer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:08:48.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
