It has acquired Ticketscript , a startup based out of Amsterdam that offers a popular platform for event organisers to set up and sell tickets online for live events like music festivals and EDM (electronic dance music) raves. \nTerms of the deal have not been disclosed, but we’re asking. Ticketscript, Eventbrite said, has sold tickets to more than 100,000 events in Europe, including Amnesia Ibiza and Love Family Park in Germany and the Amsterdam Dance Festival. \nIndeed, this deal will catapult Eventbrite — which already processed 150 million tickets for more than 600,000 event organisers in 180 countries last year — into working a lot more with larger artistic events, specifically in the area of music, in Europe. \n“This acquisition supercharges Eventbrite’s footprint in Europe and brings ten additional years of traction in the music space and experience in European markets to our business,” said Julia Hartz, CEO and co-founder of Eventbrite. “It perfectly aligns with our strategic vision to become the world’s leading marketplace for live experiences, and adds significant assets and technical power to our platform. We are looking forward to this new partnership combining the best solutions from both companies, and bringing them to our customers around the world.” \nTicketscript — which had raised just under $12 million from a single investor, FPE Capital LLP — was started in 2006 (like Eventbrit itself) by Frans Jonker (the CEO) and Ruben Meiland, who started it to have a better way for selling tickets to EDM events in their native Amsterdam. (Meiland had also founded Beatfreax, an EDM website where a lot of fans would go to see where their favorite DJs were playing.) \nEDM may have had its start as a particular genre of music played at improvised raves and some nightclubs, but it has since become a huge business, possibly event overtaking even gambling in Las Vegas in terms of revenues, by some estimates . \nWhile EDM was largely growing outside of the mainstream world of event organization — which is dominated by large multinationals and companies like Ticketmaster — Jonker and Meiland saw a gap in the market, where no one seemed to “own” the platform for creating and selling tickets to these events. \n“There was still one part of the experience where promoters didn’t have any choice: how to sell tickets,” Jonker said. “We believe it’s essential for organisers to be in control of their ticket sales, and we wanted to put them in the driver’s seat.” The growth of the wider EDM market, in turn, led to the growth of Ticketscript. Jonker becomes Eventbrite’s GM with the acquisition. \nIt sounds like the idea here will be bring much more scale to Eventbrite’s platform to ticket and process ticket sales by bolting on Ticketscript’s existing audience — making the combined company one of the biggest in Europe. For Ticketscript, the company will have more firepower to develop its platform and sell other services alongside ticketing. \n“Joining Eventbrite will help us innovate faster than ever before, and empower customers with more control and independence. It’s everything we started ticketscript to do—and now we can accelerate it,” Jonker said. \nEventbrite has made at least four other acquisitions, with one of them in Europe: event data company Lanyrd in London . 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T15:23:15.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
