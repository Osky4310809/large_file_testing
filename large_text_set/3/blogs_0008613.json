Luis Suarez was accused of diving to earn Barcelona their second penalty, while many felt Neymar also went down easily for the first spot kick of the game. Arsenal Lineups and Stats \nAnd Wenger said it's \"indefensible\" for UEFA to put up with bad refereeing in Europe's top competition and warned that the governing body will eventually end up in court if they don't make better use of technology. \n\"Honestly I believe that in the next five years, if UEFA does not bring video in, they could face legal action from television or from fans because they refuse to progress for the right decisions,\" Wenger said. \"The fans and television companies pay a lot of money and they spoil the package because they don't do the maximum to give a fair spectacle. ... Is the first [Barcelona] penalty a penalty? The second one? Honestly...\" \nWenger has long been a supporter of video technology and has often been at odds with referees this season. He was given a four-game ban for pushing the fourth official after being sent off for protesting a correct penalty decision against Burnley, and said the refereeing in Tuesday's match against Bayern was \"scandalous.\" Arsene Wenger questioned the two penalties awarded to Barcelona in their 6-1 defeat of PSG on Wednesday. \nArsenal were denied a penalty in the first half and then had Laurent Koscielny sent off after the break after a challenge on Robert Lewandowski that also earned Bayern a spot kick. \nWenger's comments came ahead of Saturday's game against Lincoln City in the FA Cup, a competition that is set to start testing a video replay system for officials next season . And UEFA must follow suit or face the consequences, Wenger said. \n\"We live in a society that is legalist and people pay more and more,\" the Frenchman said. \"If UEFA and FIFA don't take that step to go for more justice, they can't offer [viewers] what we saw for us against Bayern or the night after [in Barcelona]. It is indefensible.\" \nMattias is ESPN FC's Arsenal correspondent.
