edgy with their motions (Picture : Warwick University) University: a time of hard-work, experimentation and overthrowing the monarchy. \nYes, students have pledged to abolish the centuries old institution in a bid for more attention.\nGirls in UK are 'using socks because they can't afford sanitary towels' The move by Warwick Students’ Union is part of four motions submitted to the National Union of Students, the Boar reports. \nOther motions include calling for Indonesia to relinquish control of West Papua (8,396 miles away from the campus), and opposing the renewal of Trident.\nTo submit these motions to the NUS, they had to first be approved by delegates to the union, although not the entire student body.\nStudents are well known for such moves including on issues such as Isis.\nIt is unknown if Her Maj is quaking in her boots or not (Picture: Stefan Wermuth/Getty Images) The current president of the NUS is Malia Bouattia who has supported ‘resistance’ against Israel, called Birmingham University a ‘Zionist outpost’ and branded condemning terrorist group Islamic State ‘Islamophobic’.\nStudent unions across the country submit issues to discuss at the conference, to be held next month, and then delegates from each university list which topics to debate.\nPainting worth millions at National Gallery slashed twice by man with a screwdriver Previous motions debated, and then approved, include issues on LGBT rights, feminism and international geo-politics.\nTom Harwood, who is a delegate from Durham University and plans to run against Bouattia, is not surprised.\nHe told Metro.co.uk: ‘These motions and too many others like them make it clear that the NUS has been hijacked by extreme fringe activists who would rather posture on irrelevant geopolitical issues than fight for students.\nStudents are well known for ‘edgy’ stunts (Pictures: Getty) ‘It’s time for moderate student voices across the country to stand against these damaging motions that only serve to de-legitimise our student movement.’\nWarwick’s students also do not seem to be welcoming their union’s efforts to liberate the people of West Papua.\nThree arrested over 'child abduction' after schoolgirls, 13, went missing ‘I feel that the Student Council should be focused on more pressing and relevant matters, for example right now, there’s a massive mental health epidemic amongst university students, we need so much for support for that,’ Blessing Mukosha Park, a third-year Warwick student told the Boar .\nShe added: ‘A lot of people think of students as being in this cushty little bubble sometimes, and I think if our Student Council is focusing on issues – for example abolishing the monarchy – it makes us seem like we’re out of touch and we need to get to reality and stick to the things that are really affecting us.’\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Luke Pilot, president of Warwick SU, for comment.\nMore: UK Man campaigns for WiFi on hospital wards after his
