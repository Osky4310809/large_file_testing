Liverpool are still very much a work in progress and finishing in the top four would be a good achievement. \nBut what is harder to understand is why Liverpool’s form has been so unpredictable and inconsistent this season. \nThey did not just beat Tottenham, they destroyed them with a fabulous all-action display and then went on a mid-season break to La Manga. \nIf that was supposed to recharge Liverpool’s batteries and reinvigorate the players, then it did no such thing at the King Power Stadium. \nThey were outfought and outmanoeuvred from the start, Leicester overwhelming them in midfield as Liverpool missed injured captain Jordan Henderson’s drive, energy and leadership. Danny Drinkwater smashes in a wonder strike (Photo: REUTERS) Klopp grew more and more frustrated on the side lines (Photo: Liverpool FC) \nLiverpool’s defence looked shaky with Lucas Leiva alongside Joel Matip and they struggled against Jamie Vardy’s pace and runs. \nLiverpool rarely found any sort of rhythm and momentum going forward. Their squad suddenly looks painfully thin. Philippe Coutinho producing a rare moment of quality with a brilliant consolation. \nNo wonder Klopp often looked furious on the touchline, anger and frustration all over his face as he saw his Liverpool players get caught up in the Leicester soap opera. \nWhen Vardy headed in his second goal and Leicester’s third, Klopp looked as bemused as the rest of us. Where has this Leicester team been hiding? Meanwhile, Klopp must be wondering when the real Liverpool will stand up. poll loading Should Liverpool sack Jurgen Klopp? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:18:59.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
