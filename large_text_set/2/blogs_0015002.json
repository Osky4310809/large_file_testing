Thomas made the Pro Bowl in each of those seasons. \nBut the 28-year-old tight end saw his production take a dramatic hit in his two seasons in Jacksonville. Thomas, who signed a five-year, $46 million deal with the Jags in 2015, caught only nine touchdowns during his time in Jacksonville. \nAccording to the report, Thomas’ current contract has been cut significantly, but he can earn back much of that money through incentives. Pairing Thomas with quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who had a down year in 2016, could revitalize both of their careers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:49:33.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
