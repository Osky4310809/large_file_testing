As The Daily Caller points out: “The secret settlement appears to be one of the largest-ever discrimination settlement payouts to an individual federal employee. The payment came after an Equal Opportunity Employment office ruled that the remark was racist and accepted without challenge the claim that it caused nearly a million dollars worth of emotional harm.” \n(Mary K.) Kinney’s offense was referring to the employee, who is black, as “Buckwheat,” a character from the Little Rascals movie series. HUD had already settled with another black female over racism allegations against Kinney – which suggests that they found the allegations credible–but kept her in the top post anyway. \nNow, here’s my question: what, precisely, do you have to do to have the mere mention of Buckwheat elicit a million dollars of personal harm? Was this old classic somehow involved? \nAt some point — once we all get over the sadness of the “Our Gang” assassinations and Alfalfa’s slow descent into alcoholism — we need to really ask ourselves what would trigger, in our hearts, the impetus for a million-dollar lawsuit, and whether it would involve The Little Rascals .

Let me please escort you over to the company of Nurse Ratched and a series of cinematic characters from a mental institution picture from 1975. I get the feeling you might need to see the institutional insanity of this “Cuckoo’s Nest.” And there are Indians in it! \nIf not, though — what the hell? And more specifically, what the hell is our government thinking paying money on behalf of idiots who think this way? \nThere is a certain point of ridiculousness which we have apparently passed, if this story is accurate (we have not independently verified). Our government — our tax dollars — are now paying for some idiot who had the temerity to call someone else “Buckwheat.” And instead of holding that profoundly idiotic individual accountable , we’ve held America accountable.
