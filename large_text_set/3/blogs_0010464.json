I am not sure what type of response they were expecting with this meme generator, but I took it as an insult. So anyone can become The Major now? Is that some type of justification for the whitewashing they've done? I cannot speak for Asian women and I am not trying to speak for them, but it's clear how they feel about this. So I did what I did to stand in solidarity with them, and to send a message to Hollywood that we aren't going to sit idly by while they co-opt and transform stories seemingly meant for other demographics of viewers.\nOf course, Ghost in the Shell isn't the only recent picture to co-opt Asian culture while downplaying or erasing Asian characters. People also used the meme generator to blast other examples of whitewashing, cultural appropriation and white saviors in Hollywood.\nMarvel's Iron Fist , which has been slammed for (among other things) its queasy racial dynamics, was a target for the internet's scorn. As was Marvel's Doctor Strange , which famously cast Tilda Swinton as a character who is Asian in the comics.\n@ValerieComplex @JennLi123 pic.twitter.com/fGLySmZv8z\n‚Äî David Lo Pun-ch Nazi (@helpmeskeletor) March 11, 2017\nTilda Edition #IAmMajor https://t.co/Cyu5IjlDbJ @helpmeskeletor @KellyKanayama\n‚Äî Wei Ming Kam (@weimingkam) March 12, 2017\nAnd let's not forget the time Emma Stone played a part-Asian character in Cameron Crowe's Aloha .\n@helpmeskeletor @weimingkam @KellyKanayama @JennLi123 pic.twitter.com/d4yCHK6YOr\n‚Äî VzA (@ValerieComplex) March 12, 2017\nThere's a lot more sass where that came from.
