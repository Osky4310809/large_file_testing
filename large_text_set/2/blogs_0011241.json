You could strike a perfect match on a dating app—she’s smart, she’s fit, she’s funny, she’s a Cubs fan—but then you’re in the middle of a nice steak dinner when suddenly she reveals she voted for Trump, and now you can’t wait for the check to come. So how do you make sure true love never gets thwarted again? OK Cupid has your back: The dating service has unveiled two new features for its mobile app that are designed to nip these ideological issues in the bud . \nFirst up is a new-for-2017 Questions & Categories feature, which asks you a set of 50 topical questions that daters are “extremely passionate about,” says OK Cupid—such as “Is climate change real?,”“Have you ever ghosted on someone after you’ve met them in person?,” and simply, “Trump?”—and uses your responses to narrow your pool of matches and find someone who shares your same political, ideological, and apparently ghosting beliefs.
