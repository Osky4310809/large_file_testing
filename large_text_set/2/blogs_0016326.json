Dorfman, 29, ultimately picked Â Murray, though the two broke off their engagement Â in January 2015 after eight months together.\nA little over a year later,Â Dorfman released a tell-all memoir about her experience with theÂ Bachelor Â franchise â€” and in particular, the reasons behind her split from Murray,Â claiming he was controlling, paranoid and verbally abusive .\nDorfmanâ€™s book went on to become a point of contentionÂ during Murrayâ€™sÂ Bachelor in Paradise Â stint last summer. After he struck up a romance with Amanda Stanton, severalÂ BiP costars â€” including Viall â€” brought up Dorfmanâ€™sÂ allegations as a source of concern. Murray, for his part, denied theÂ accusations and said the book was â€œa fictional story.â€ (Murray and Stanton have since broken off theirÂ engagement ,Â though Murray confirmed they are now talking again .)\nThis embed is invalid\nâ€œThatâ€™s Â way of making money and stuff, and thatâ€™s great, and if Iâ€™ve got to be the fall guy for everything in whatever her stories are, then whatever,â€ Murray told ET Â on Monday of the memoir, adding that he hasÂ â€œno intentions of ever seeing or talkingâ€ to Dorfman again.\nâ€œItâ€™s very tempting to tell the truth,â€ he continued, explaining that heâ€™s been asked to write a book, but hasnâ€™t because he doesnâ€™t want to attack people. â€œThere could be a book written that would be very, very bad, but thatâ€™s not something I want to do.â€\nUltimately, Murray advises any futureÂ Bachelor nation contestants to stay true to themselves.\nâ€œAlways be yourself,â€ he warned. â€œBecause theyâ€™re going to portray you how they want to portray you for the storyline.â€\nThe BachelorÂ airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:44:02.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
