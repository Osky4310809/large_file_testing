However in this tutorial from Indy Mogul , DP James Codeglia shows you how to build \"covered wagons\" like the ones he used while working on several J.J. Abrams films. Like Kino Flos, they are low profile, lightweight, powerful lights, but will cost a whole lot less. \nAs far as I can tell, Codeglia's DIY light is pretty standard compared to other covered wagons, except for one slight difference—a difference that gives it that Kino Flo functionality. Instead of designing it with the bulbs facing up, he sets the bulbs on their sides, which gives the light a low enough profile that it can be put just about anywhere. \nHe uses incandescent light bulbs, which are cheap, accessible, and make skin tones look nice. However, if those kinds of bulbs aren't your cup of tea, you can always switch them out (or even the fixtures) for something else. A possible alternative would be replacing the incandescents with LED lights—whichever ones you have on hand—because you solve the problem/risk of your light getting too hot and potentially starting a fire or just burning the shit out of your paw. You might lose a little color accuracy though. \nMy one beef with this tutorial is that it doesn't provide a materials list, nor step-by-step instructions on how to build it. You kind of have to figure it out for yourself, which isn't that bad if you know your way around hammers and screws—and complex and potentially dangerous electrical wiring. I think Codeglia gives you just enough to have an idea of what to do, but you'll have to go the rest of the way on your own. \nBut we'll try to help you part of the way, since I'm no electrician and couldn't tell you how to wire a hanger. Here's an unofficial list of materials used in the tutorial, complete with guesses, conjecture, and only a few quantities for each supply. Enjoy.
