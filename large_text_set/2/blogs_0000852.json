Glaiza Lee (philstar.com) | Updated February 2, 2017 - 11:07am Erwan Heussaff and Raymond Gutierrez Century Tuna/Released \nMANILA, Philippines – Even after Miss France Iris Mittenaere has been crowned as the new Miss Universe, her answer – more like the translation of it – in the question and answer portion in the recently concluded beauty pageant held in the Philippines, kept netizens buzzing. \nSome doubted the interpreter gave the right intepretation; while others believed that her interpreter has missed out on some important points in his translation. Netizens noted that when the buzzer rang signaling that her 30-second time allocation has ended, the interpreter had to rush the translation. \nFilipino-French blogger/restaurateur Erwan Heussaff took it upon himself to clear things out and gave his own translation in his Twitter post. It somehow helps clarify things and make netizens understand why her answer led to the most coveted title. \nHe posted: “Close translation; I have failed several times in my life. I thought I had failed my first year in medical school because my name wasn’t on the passing list. So, the very same day, I went to buy a new set of medical books to keep on studying. I think when you fail, you need to stand up and keep going, we are all able to do so. If I don’t win tonight, I will still keep on smiling tomorrow because I am proud to be part of the three finalists. I’ve learned a lot from my failures and happily, I did end up passing my first year of medical school.” \n  \n\nHe even wrote a disclaimer that the “clip wasn’t clean when I listened to it, so there may be some tense and grammar mistakes.” \nJourney to wellness \nBut translating Miss France’s answer is not the only thing that keeps Erwan busy. The newly-engaged guy, who just proposed to his girlfriend actress-host Anne Curtis during their recent US trip last December, is currently helping TV host/celebrity Raymond Gutierrez make a major lifestyle change. \nRaymond, whose weight has been influx through the years, admitted that he had a hard time finding a sustainable routine and lifestyle because of the nature of his work – from co-owning one of the biggest nightclubs in the country, to working long hours in the showbiz industry and producing creative events. \n“I realized I really needed a lifestyle change. I was going too hard and too fast in whatever I do. I thought I needed to take a break. And if I don’t do it now, when will I do this?” shared Raymond. \nTo keep him motivated and committed, he decided to keep the public involved. And that was where Erwan came in. Erwan and Raymond came up with a new campaign to document the latter's journey to a healthier lifestyle. Century Tuna/Released \nRaymond and Erwan brainstormed together, and they came up with “No Excuses”, a campaign which will follow Raymond’s journey as he changes his lifestyle through the help of three mentors. Erwan will help Raymond to integrate wellness into his life, while nutritionist Nadine Tengco will teach him the right diet to take, and Arnold Aninion will be Raymond’s fitness coach. \n“The reason that it took me so long to do this is because of the many excuses in my head. I don’t know how to cook. My kitchen is practically a dressing room. I go to the gym but I’m always on my phone. These are the excuses I usually say to the people around me,” said Raymond, who would bust all these excuses on his way to fitness and health. \nRaymond’s progress will be posted in the Century Tuna website, along with the workouts, recipes, and other articles to boost wellness, to encourage viewers to take inspiration from his journey to health. \nApart from helping in the digital contents showing how Raymond is shaping up in the next three months, Erwan will help Raymond integrate fitness into his daily life. \n“Regardless of where you’re from, who you are, or what you do, all it takes is a little nudge in the right direction. The idea is not just to lose weight, but to get fitter and healthier. Generally, it takes about 90 days or three months to create a lifestyle change, and this is the time frame we will be working on,” said Erwan, who thinks that this is quite an ironic time to live in because health information are everywhere, and yet there is still an alarming rise in lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, heart conditions, and obesity, among others. \nErwan believes that a healthy lifestyle is a choice. “All it takes to get fit and healthy are a pair of shoes, proper knowledge and willingness to make things work.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T09:10:32.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
