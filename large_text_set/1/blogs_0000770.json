\nThe winter sales are upon us and Premier League sides up and down the country are scouring the market as they bid to avoid relegation/push into the European places/chase the title. \nThere are players across the top flight, and further afield, who could leave their current clubs in January, with some big names facing an uncertain four weeks. \nSo - who could be on the move in January? And where are they likely to end up? \nOur man Darren Lewis has picked out 10 big names who are set to be targeted between now and the end of the month... Daniel Sturridge - Liverpool Sturridge has struggled for a regular starting berth (Photo: Reuters) \nThe Reds’ faithful will not hear of him leaving but a number of clubs - including West Ham - know that he wants to play more regularly and are set to target him. The interested parties may opt for loans but Liverpool are unlikely to sanction his departure unless they get a big-money offer they can’t refuse. Virgil van Dijk - Southampton Man City and Everton have been linked with moves for Van Dijk (Photo: Julian Finney) \nHe was sent off in Saturday’s home defeat to West Brom. Could that be the last time his club’s fans see him in a Saints shirt? He has interest from Manchester City and Everton who are keen to strengthen in defence. The Saints may ultimately end up surrendering their best players but they tend not to do so in January. Could this window be the exception? Jermain Defoe - Sunderland West Ham are interested in Defoe (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nDavid Moyes remains adamant that he won’t be sold but West Ham are in no mood to give up and the battle for his services is set to continue over the next few weeks. Defoe continues to do his job, netting his ninth goal of the season on Saturday despite the Black Cats’ inability to defend at Burnley. Morgan Schneiderlin - Manchester United Schneiderlin has barely featured under Mourinho (Photo: Reuters) \nUnwanted by Jose Mourinho but sought after by both Everton and West Brom. The former Southampton midfielder has been out in the cold at Old Trafford but will surely recapture his form either working under countryman Ronald Koeman at Goodison or bringing his class to West Brom. Both clubs want him. He’ll go if the money is right. Memphis Depay - Manchester United Depay has flopped at Old Trafford (Photo: Gareth Copley) \nEverton lead the chase but French league leaders Nice are also interested in the Dutchman whose career has disintegrated since he moved to Old Trafford. United could favour selling to Nice to ensure that Depay doesn’t come back to haunt them. Modou Barrow - Swansea Palace are interested in Barrow (Photo: Athena Pictures/Getty) \nSam Allardyce has taken a shine to the 24-year-old Gambian winger who has a £5million relegation clause in his contract. The Swans may have been awful so far this season but Barrow has managed to attract a few admirers with his performances so far. He has a relegation clause of £5m but the Welsh club - who look bang in trouble - might cash in if they get a offer too good to turn down. Francesco Acerbi - Sassuolo Acerbi is on Leicester's radar (Photo: Matthias Hangst / Getty) \nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri is keen on the 28-year-old Italian who plays in central defence. The Foxes are understood already to have had a £9million bid rejected but Ranieri is actively seeking a new centre-half this month. He has already wrapped up a £15million deal for highly-rated Genk midfielder Wilfred Ndidi and clearly means business this month. Callum Wilson - Bournemouth Newcastle could make a play for Wilson (Photo: Dan Mullan) \nInteresting one this. Newcastle are interested despite the fact that Bournemouth would want a monster offer to even consider selling their star striker. Wilson has scored five times this season and remains a key part of Eddie Howe’s plans. \nLast season the Cherries rejected a combined bid of £25million for both Wilson and wideman Matt Ritchie. Ritchie is now at Newcastle but it would take a huge offer to tempt Wilson into joining him. Rudy Gestede - Aston Villa Gestede has managed only four goals in the Championship (Photo: Neville Williams) \nImpressive stats for Blackburn but his move to Villa Park hasn’t worked out. Just four goals so far this season, all in the Championship but Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka has seen enough to want to offer Gestede a return to the Premier League. \nTalks are ongoing with a deal expected to be reached this month. Gerard Deulofeu - Everton It's not worked out for Deulofeu under Ronald Koeman (Photo: Alex Livesey) \nDid well for Roberto Martinez at Goodison but it hasn’t worked out this season under Ronald Koeman. The 22-year-old has options in Spain and Italy with AC Milan the club leading the chase for his signature. poll loading Will Virgil van Dijk be at Southampton after the January transfer window? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T13:52:44.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
