Gucci’s new “sock sandals” have the internet in a tizzy, and when you see them — you’ll understand why.\nNordstrom introduced the shoes — from Gucci’s spring 2017 collection — for pre-order on its website this week, and when hawk-eyed tweeters caught wind of the kicks, all hell broke loose.\nFrom “is this an early April Fool’s joke” to “quite possibly the creepiest shoes I have ever laid eyes on,” Twitter was uniformly displeased with the high-fashion brand’s latest offering.\nAnd oh yeah, Twitter was also quick to point out that with a price tag of nearly $1,200, this head-scratching look doesn’t come cheap.\nNordstrom You can pre-order them here for $1,190, if you’re in the mood to throw money around. \nTwitter had an absolute field day with these shoes that pair latex and leather for a seductive “severed foot” look. We're filming a performance on Sunday. The Mom Jeans + the Gucci sock/sandals are my wardrobe plan.
