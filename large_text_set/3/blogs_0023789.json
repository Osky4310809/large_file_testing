So, let’s all give a hearty golf clap to those 201 MPs for being woke, or however they refer to it there. So the liberals decide that the day after a \"radicalized\" muslim goes on a killing spree is a good time to push through the idiotic #M103 ? \n— Ken H. Schmidt (@real_ExtraSauce) March 23, 2017 \nThe motion also calls for the creation of a committee to develop “a government-wide approach for reducing or eliminating systemic racism and religious discrimination, including Islamophobia.” \nThe CBC reports that Saskatchewan Conservative MP David Anderson had attempted to remove the word “Islamophobia” from the motion in favor of “all forms of systemic racism, religious intolerance and discrimination of Muslims, Jews Christians, Sikhs, Hindus and other religious communities,” but that wording was rejected. \nSince it’s just a motion and not a law, M-103 does not curtail freedom of speech or impose penalties, but a lot of Canadians are wary of just what that special committee might come up with. @newberryontour @KellieLeitch Bills start as motions. I worry about #M103 progressing. Coward #JustinTrudeau didn't even vote \n— Diane Dallas (@DianeDallas10) March 23, 2017 Trudeau accuses Canadians of being racist and then is to cowardly to attend HoC for the vote on M103. A poor excuse for a leader. \n— Rob Pushor (@robpushor) March 23, 2017 #M103 “Islamophobia” Motion is approved by a vote of 201-91. I voted against. #cdnpoli \n— Tony Clement (@TonyclementCPC) March 23, 2017 This afternoon, I voted against Motion #M103 . However, it passed 201-91. #PrinceAlbert \n— Randy Hoback (@MPRandyHoback) March 23, 2017 Canada's Parliament has just declared criticism of Islam off-limits. The anti-Islamophobia motion, M-103, passed by a margin of 201 to 91. \n— Andrew Lawton (@AndrewLawton) March 23, 2017 @javeedsukhera I thought a love of free speech was something that united Canadians. That doesn't seem to be the case anymore. M-103 is bad. \n— Jeff Harris (@TheVotersSay) March 23, 2017 Trending There are NO stupid questions, unless you're Ashley Judd asking THIS about the Constitution \nAlso criticized was the use of the word Islamophobia itself, which opponents of the motion said had no specific definition despite its common use. @StefMacWilliams The M103 proponents, ugh. Islamophobia is a meaningless word or a word that can mean anything but they don't get that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:53:21.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
