Today, guests can sit in Booth 1, where John F. Kennedy ate breakfast on Sundays after attending mass at nearby Holy Trinity Church (he was partial to the \"early riser\" breakfast, with eggs, toast, hash browns, ham, bacon or sausage, juice, and coffee). Other presidential menu favorites include the cheeseburger (ordered by Bill Clinton), meatloaf (Richard Nixon), and prime rib (Harry S. Truman). Wondering what to drink? Whiskey lovers should enjoy Lyndon B. Johnson's favorite pairing: bourbon with steak, which he purportedly ordered many times at the tavern with Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn in tow.\nInsider Tip: John F. Kennedy proposed to Jacqueline Onassis in Booth 3, or what the staff call \"the proposal booth.\"\nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor's Washington, D.C. Guide\nGasby's Tavern Restaurant Jackie M. / Yelp Where: Alexandria, VA\nIt's only fitting to fête Washington's birthday where he himself celebrated the occasion with dining and dancing: at Gadsby's Tavern in 1798 and 1799 (at the latter gathering, he reportedly enjoyed canvas-back duck, hominy and Madeira, the much-enjoyed fortified wine of the time). The tavern also played host to a lavish inaugural banquet for Thomas Jefferson. Today, it hosts George Washington’s Birthnight Banquet and Ball, an annual Rum Challenge (rum punch was the tavern’s signature drink in the 18th century) and offers special Madeira tastings to visitors.\nInsider Tip: Stop by the Gadsby's Tavern Museum next door, where guests can peruse dining areas, rooms and the banquet hall, which hosted the first six American presidents.\nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor's Alexandria Guide\nVermilion Hilary G. / Yelp Where: Alexandria, VA\nThe Obamas celebrated Valentine's Day at this Old Town Alexandria restaurant in 2012 — known for highlighting locally sourced ingredients and supporting the area’s artisans and farmers — where President Barack Obama was spotted dining without a tie.

On one occasion in 2012, Clinton was seen enjoying vegetarian dishes and drinking tea, followed by a glass of red wine. Chef/Partner Zakarian says, \"Every time President Clinton visits The Lambs Club he is extremely upbeat and polite. He always takes the time to greet the staff members and shake hands with people.\"\nInsider Tip: The landmarked building was originally home to America’s first professional theater club, The Lambs, which counted Fred Astaire, Charlie Chaplin, and Milton Berle among its members.\nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor's New York City Guide\nFresco by Scotto Facebook.com/FrescobyScotto Where: New York City\nFormer President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton celebrated their wedding anniversary at Fresco by Scotto , a Midtown Manhattan eatery — and began their meal with the restaurant’s signature potato and zucchini chips dish, served with gorgonzola cheese.

In honor of the many presidential visits, the bar's chief bartender and recreational historian Jim Hewes created a presidential-themed drink menu, which features beverages that can be linked by anecdotes back to each commander in chief, like Bacardi rum and Coke for Richard M. Nixon, who would relish mixing the drink for guests aboard the presidential yacht, the USS Sequoia.\nInsider Tip: To hobnob with Washington’s elite, don’t miss the bar’s annual Kentucky Derby party — complete with bow ties, big hats and the signature drink: the Henry Clay mint julep.\nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor's Washington, D.C.
