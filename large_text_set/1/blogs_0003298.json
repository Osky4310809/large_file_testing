She picked up a knife in the kitchen and then stabbed him causing a superficial injury.” \nAfter the violent bust-up they left the house, but he returned soon after, fearing for his safety. Clayton was sentenced at Blackburn Magistrates Court (Photo: Googlemaps) \nBut the next morning Clayton returned to the property and attacked him for a second time. \nBlackburn magistrates’ court heard Mr Hill emerged from a room with cuts to his hands and shouted: “She has stabbed me again”. \nMiss Akhtar told the court : “She returned the following morning and Mr Hill suffered injuries to his hands.” \nClayton, 34, of Blackburn, Lancs., pleaded guilty to assaulting Mr Hill,causing him actual bodily harm. \nShe was sentenced to 26 weeks in custody and ordered to pay £115 victim surcharge on release. \nThe prosecutor said the victim had refused to co-operate or give a statement to police. \nShe said: “He later told police he didn’t want to co-operate because she has mental health problems.” \nRichard Prew, defending, said there had been no previous domestic incidents. and the couple had enjoyed a very supportive relationship until this incident. \n“He didn’t want to make a complaint against his partner,” said Mr Prew.
