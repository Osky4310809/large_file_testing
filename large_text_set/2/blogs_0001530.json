Unfortunately, many of these images have been shared on social media. This is extremely disappointing as this is not an accurate representation of our student body.” \nThe principal added that an investigation is underway and that “those implicated will be punished according to the Student Code of Conduct,” the station reported. \n“We ask that you talk to your students regarding the posting and sharing of negative social media as this perpetuates a false image of Cy Ranch HS,” the principal also wrote, according to the station.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:01:50.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
