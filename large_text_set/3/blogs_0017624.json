Kamalakannan, is working round the clock to meet the deadline. \n“It cannot get any bigger than this — my fifth film with director S S Rajamouli — and will easily rank as the most cherished one with a historical connotation,” says Kamalakannan, who is on a mission to complete the project. \nThe most-anticipated sequel of the century had an impressive trailer launch in Hyderabad, followed by one in Mumbai, where director SS Rajamouli, lead cast Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, along with presenter of the film’s Hindi version, Karan Johar, and Anil Thadani of AA Films. \nThe SS Rajamouli-directed magnum opus will release in Telugu, Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam, apart from being dubbed in other foreign languages at a later stage. The trailer has got record views and trending worldwide. Kamalakannan says he feels amazing that in the two years since he was entrusted with the job (Srinivas Mohan did the first part), major VFX studios in the country are following the course of progress. About the trailer launch he says, “Rajamouli, with a wireless microphone, controlled everything – including when to close the door, switch off the lights, wait for the theatre to get darker, and screen the 2-minute 20-second trailer, twice.” \nKamalakannan says he was in awe, watching it on the big screen for the first time. “Yes, I got goose bumps, with so many brand names around the whole world viewing the happening.” Here are excerpts from the interview \nYou must have been a relieved man, post the trailer launch? \nYou can say that again. As the whole world knows, the sequel is on a much broader canvas. It looks as if the whole world is curious to know why Kattappa killed Baahubali. No talk show on TV has been complete without this poser to the artistes concerned. But the secret has been well-maintained, increasing the suspense level each day. \nBut some seem to have already deciphered the answer. You only have to relate to the scene where Kattappa admits that he is only a slave, out there to take orders. \nI will not have any say on that. Why should I play spoiler at this juncture? I can assure you of some amazing effects, reserved strictly for a movie of this magnitude. \nRajamouli has said that his next will be without your visual effects \nHe has been saying this each time, but our partnership has touched the fifth time. It is a feeling akin to that of man touching the moon or climbing the Everest. When he has seen the best, everything else will look secondary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T16:56:56.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
