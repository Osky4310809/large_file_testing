However, the Primera Division appears to be slipping away from Luis Enrique's side COMMENT \nLionel Messi to the rescue. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner stepped up to level with a stunning strike in the last minute and save Barcelona from a damaging defeat away to an excellent Villarreal on Sunday. But La Liga is now very much in Real Madrid's hands. \nM essi salvages a point for Barcelona \nBarca began the day six points behind their fierce rivals and had the chance to cut that deficit to three, albeit with one more match played due to Real's recent participation in the Club World Cup. \nBut this was another subdued showing. With Ivan Rakitic left out of the squad amid reports in Croatia that the midfielder will join Manchester City in the January transfer window, Andre Gomes was disappointing again in midfield. \nGomes, along with Barca's other summer signings, was supposed to help Barca's strength in depth. However, he has added little and bar Samuel Umtiti and some select moments from Lucas Digne and Denis Suarez, the Blaugrana do not seem stronger at all. \nNeymar put in a shift further forward, but the Brazilian is nowhere near his best at the moment and Luis Suarez was off colour once more, leaving it to Messi to salvage something from a game that had looked like going against Luis Enrique's side after Nicola Sansone shot Villarreal in front. \nR eal Madrid equal Barca's record run \nMessi has papered over the cracks on numerous occasions in recent seasons, but Barca's current form is as bad as anything the Catalans have produced under Luis Enrique and they will not win the title with the Argentine's talents alone. \nVillarreal, to their credit, were excelllent. Bruno Soriano is one of La Liga's best midfielders and although he was fortunate not to concede a penalty for a blatant handball, he frustrated Barca all night. And alongside him, Manu Trigueros and Jonathan dos Santos also worked incredibly hard to contain the visitors. \nVillarreal are now one of the finest teams in La Liga. Despite a late coaching change in the summer, the Yellow Submarine are in fifth, just one point behind Atletico and five adrift of Barcelona, under Fran Escriba. \n39 unbeaten: Real & Barca runs compared \nFor their part, Barca are five behind Madrid and that with one more match played. La Liga, theirs in each of the last two seasons and in six of the previous eight overall, now appears to be slipping away. \n\"La Liga doesn't depend on us,\" Luis Enrique admitted afterwards. \"It depends on Real Madrid, who are the strongest team.\" \nThere is a long way to go, of course, and the championship is not even at its halfway stage yet. However, Madrid have not been beaten in any competition for 39 games and if they win their game in hand, they will be eight points clear of Barca. \nAnd that is lot of ground to make up - even with Lionel Messi in your team.
