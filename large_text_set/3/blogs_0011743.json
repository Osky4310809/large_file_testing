(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Cromwell by Hans Holbein the Younger English: This miniature portrait shows Thomas Cromwell (c. 14851–540), the leader of Henry VIII's government in the 1530s, after he had been made a member of the Order of the Garter in 1537. It is derived from Holbein's 1532 portrait of Cromwell but shows him looking older.
