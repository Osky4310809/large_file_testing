Regardless, the President called for an investigation in to the matter shortly after he was inaugurated.\nStephanopoulos continually pressed Miller for more evidence throughout the interview, but Miller’s failed to provide further detail.\n“For the record, you have provided zero evidence that the president was the victim of massive voter fraud in New Hampshire,” Stephanopoulos said at the end of the interview. “You have provided zero evidence of the president’s claim that he would have won the popular vote if 3-to-5 million illegal immigrants hadn’t voted. Zero evidence for either one of those claims. Thanks a lot of joining us this morning.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T21:44:25.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
