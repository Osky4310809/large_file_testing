From there, Kimmel only got fiercer, sniping that: “[Matt] handed what turned out to be an Oscar-caliber role [in Manchester by the Sea] to [Casey Affleck] and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead. And that movie, The Great Wall , went on to lose $80 million.”\nJimmy Kimmel roasts Matt Damon at the #Oscars : \"When I first met Matt, I was the fat one.\" pic.twitter.com/ZOKmuPjOma \n— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017 \n\nKimmel then went on to mock Damon’s 2011 movie, We Bought a Zoo, in a segment you can watch above. Once that was over, the actor — announced by the narrator as mere “guest” — took to the stage with long-time friend Ben Affleck before being inevitably interrupted as he attempted to present.\nThe pranks should come as no surprise to Damon given Kimmel had been hinting at his plans on social media earlier this week.\nBest Picture Vominee Matt Damon #Oscars \nA post shared by Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) on Feb 23, 2017 at 6:58pm PST \n\nDead man walking the red carpet. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/j2KaUkdHTX \n— Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) February 27, 2017 \n\nFor those who don’t know, the pair have been at it for over 10 years, with the initial “beef” traceable to old episodes of Jimmy Kimmel Live! where Jimmy used to joke about time running out for his last guest, Matt Damon. When Damon did appear on the show a year later, Kimmel made sure they actually did run out of time.\n\nWe wait for the next chapter with bated breath.\nIn other Oscars news, be sure to check out this A-list episode of Mean Tweets .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:47:47.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
