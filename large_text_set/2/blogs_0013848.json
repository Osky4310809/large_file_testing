The 31-year-old striker hasn’t started a match for the Red Devils since mid-December and there’s still a chance that he won’t finish the season at Old Trafford. \nThe Telegraph are reporting that several Chinese clubs are in talks with United. The Chinese transfer window doesn’t close until the end of February. That gives all parties ten days to work out a deal which could suit all parties. \nUnited would be able to get the £300,000-a-week forward off their wage bill and could even command a sizeable transfer fee. Rooney is being offered at least £32 million a year to come to China with 18 months left on his United deal. The Chinese Super League would be getting a player whose profile and commercial value is still incredible. United legacy \nThere’s no doubting Rooney’s legacy at United. Last month, the England captain became the club’s all-time leading scorer when he broke Sir Bobby Charlton’s long-standing record with his 250th goal coming against Stoke. \nIt was his first league goal since August. Rooney is currently out with a muscular problem.
