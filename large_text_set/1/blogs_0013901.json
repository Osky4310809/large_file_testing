Hugs to baby! https://t.co/0mQEY5fiLz \n— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) January 11, 2017 \nThat was in reaction to an NBC report yesterday that said this : \nOfficials prepared a two-page summary of the memo for Trump’s briefing Friday at Trump Tower in New York. The summary was an “annex,” or addendum, included in the “supporting documents” that accompanied the classified briefing report. \nWhile multiple officials say the summary was included in the material prepared for the briefers, the senior official told NBC News that the briefing was oral and no actual documents were left with the Trump team in New York. During the briefing, the president-elect was not briefed on the contents of the summary. \nThe CNN report out tonight specifically says Trump was briefed on the two-page summary: It was FBI Director Comey in a one on one who briefed PEOTUS Trump on that synopsis, we can now report.
