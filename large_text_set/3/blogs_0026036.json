Aráoz’s family called the authorities who searched for him all night and into the next day, when temperatures reached a sweltering 113 degrees. \nThen, firefighters saw a dog barking frantically at passersby. Living in the same neighborhood, the firefighters immediately recognized the dog as Simon. They followed the Labrador, who led them to a pasture where they found Aráoz laying on the ground, dangerously dehydrated and near the point of passing out. \nAráoz was taken to the hospital where he and Simon were treated. \nIf it weren’t for the loyalty of his beloved hound, Aráoz would have likely died in the heat. 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:46:16.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
