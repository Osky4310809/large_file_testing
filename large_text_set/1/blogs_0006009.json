So how do you go from bread bags to defending the top 1 percent not having to pay taxes?” \n2. Heat Street found that daytime anchor Craig Melvin owed over $2,500 in back taxes and in January of 2016 had a lien filed against him in New York. He didn’t pay off that amount until the final weeks of the year. \nMelvin is another talking head who has spoken on air and in social media about the wealthy needing to pay more taxes. \n“Should peeps earning a million $ or more a year pay more income taxes than those making less? Would a ‘millionaire’s tax’ help the economy?” he once asked his Twitter followers. \n3. Next up, Chris Matthews , against whom Maryland took out a lien for nearly $4,000 last summer. (He has since paid his debt.) \nMatthews has repeatedly held forth about tax policy, saying of one disagreement between former House Speak John Boehner and Barack Obama that the key issues was “that there be tax fairness — the people at the top, who now get a tax break of about 5 percent, should not get that anymore because they don’t need it.”   \nIronically, he spoke those words to the next entry on the list, who agreed with him. \n4. MSNBC’s Joy-Ann Reid said, “Right, absolutely,” in response to Matthew’s comments above. \nReid also joined the list of MSNBC’s hosts with tax issues, recently settling a New York tax lien for about $5,000. \n“It was very important to Obama’s base that he gets those rates up on the top earners. That was what he promised,” she also told Matthews in the segment. \n5. Last year, Kristen Welker paid off $6,700 in California tax liens, and while she has not been as vocal about her opinion on the tax policy, she has reported on the issue. \n“Potus: ‘majority of voters agree with me’ when it comes to wealthy paying more in taxes. A subtle suggestion that he’s got a mandate,” she once wrote on her Twitter account. \n6. Touré Neblett, who was fired by MSNBC back in 2015, has had major issues with his taxes. The IRS reportedly filed two separate tax liens against him for over $257,000 from a four-year time span between 2008-2012. \nHe once wrote on Twitter, “Regressive taxation & tax-avoidance & union crushing & the financial corruption of legislation has fueled inequality more than hard work.” \nAt least he knew a little about what he was writing, at least when it comes to tax avoidance. \n7. The list wouldn’t be complete without Melissa Harris-Perry , who left the network in 2016. Harris-Perry had a federal tax lien taken out against her for about $70,000 in 2015. She reportedly paid it off the following year. \nAccording to The Daily Caller , news of her lien came after years of lectures from Harris-Perry where she was adamant that high taxes are good thing, because as she argues, they pay for much needed entitlement programs the poor depend upon. \nHe just doesn’t want to help the poor herself, apparently.
