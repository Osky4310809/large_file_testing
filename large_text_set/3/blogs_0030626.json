Protesters shot hand-held footage while chained to the aircraft \nSusan James from Plane Stupid said: “Mass deportations like the one we stopped are immoral, unfair and illegal. \n“In the wake of the Brexit vote, this government is more keen than ever to be seen to be “tough” on immigration. But its mass deportations have devastating human consequences. \n\"Everything about these deportations points to the fact that they are inhuman, and must be stopped.” \nSpeaking by phone from the runway, protester Emma Hughes told activist website Huck she was trying to prevent families from being separated. \nShe said: “We’ve taken this action because many people on this flight are being placed in serious danger by being callously deported back to Nigeria and Ghana. \n“There’s been a lot of attention recently on Trump’s racist Muslim ban, but what’s happening in the UK is equally repellant.’ \nA Home Office spokesman said it could not comment on operational activity but added: ‘We respect everyone’s right to peaceful protest but we are clear that removal is an essential element of an effective immigration system. \n‘We expect those with no legal basis to remain in the UK to leave voluntarily but if they do not, we will seek to enforce their departure.’ \nEssex Police said they were called by airport officials at 9.30pm on Tuesday after protesters \"gained access to Stansted Airport air-side\". \nA spokesman said: \"Protesters entered and locked themselves on to an aircraft destined for Nigeria. Officers are currently at the scene and we are in the process of removing them.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:15:31.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
