Alyssa Catalano now works with her husband Michael, designing handcrafted metal jewelry, while playing a role in the craft manufacturing movement. Alyssa Catalano, co-owner, Studebaker Metals, with her daugher, Betty Lou Studebaker Joe Wojcik “We met and realized we had skills to exploit,” co-owner Catalano said. “Michael and I do all of the design.” When they met, Studebaker worked as a metalsmith while Catalano worked photo art director and head of styling at ModCloth. They ultimately realized they were both interested in using traditional tooling and techniques to create jewelry. The couple worked in a basement before moving to Braddock, where they have a production facility and storefront, allowing Studebaker to be a craft manufacturer supporting the local economy. “We have a strong interest in hiring Braddock residents,” she said. One of their apprentices was a neighbor who asked if he could learn metalsmithing. While Catalano enjoys serving as designer, human resources manager, photographer, copy writer and account manager, she especially likes being a mentor. “When it comes to women starting businesses I pretty much have an open door,” she said. “Really it is not just women; my passion is helping artists monetize their craft.” BIOGRAPHY CAREER: Photo art director, head of styling, ModCloth; buyer, Urban Outfitters CONTACT : Studebaker Metals, 534 Braddock Ave., Braddock, PA 15104; alyssa@studebakermetals.com; 412-852-4733 WEBSITE: studebakermetals.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T14:26:15.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
