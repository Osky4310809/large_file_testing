Musicians Talk About Their First Guitar The compilation of replies to the question, \"what was your first guitar?\" from Billy Howerdel, Kyle Gass, Bill Kelliher, Robby Krieger, Kiko Loureiro and others. Lives in Minnesota. Been doing interviews for UG since 2011. GG Allin fan. Posted a day ago 12 \nOver the years, I’ve done somewhere around 600 interviews with musicians of every distinction and genre. I find myself often asking the same questions as they generally yielded interesting information. As guitarists, we never forget our first guitar, so it seemed natural to ask guitarists about their first guitar and what first got them to pick up the instrument and dedicate the time and energy to learning how to play it. So I put together a compilation of replies to the question, “what was your first guitar?” Enjoy. If you have an interesting story about how you came about owning your first guitar, please let us know about it in the comments section. Brian Baker (Bad Religion, Minor Threat, Dag Nasty) \nMy first electric guitar was about a ‘64 or ‘65 Epiphone Coronet. I got this guitar when I was 9. I was lucky to have parents who encouraged me to play early on which was pivotal for me. The guitar I got after that was the one that started it all. The Coronet was kind of a student guitar but I had a Princeton Reverb and was trying to figure out how to sound like people I liked but the Coronet pickups just weren’t doing it. So my dad took me to a local music store in Washington DC called Chuck Levin’s Music Store which is actually still there today and at the price range that my dad could afford I was looking at a Gibson S-1 and a Marauder – this was in about 1975 I think. So, I’m looking at these two horrible guitars – low points of the Norlin Era. But there is a used early seventies Les Paul Deluxe there on the wall as well and my dad notices that the used Deluxe was less money that the new S-1 and the new Marauder and points me to the cheaper guitar. My dad knew nothing about guitars, but that’s how I got my first Les Paul. I think it was a ‘73 Tobacco Deluxe and within three months it had three DiMarzio Super Distortions in it (thank you, Ace Frehley) and that’s what started it all - totally true story. [I don’t still have it] but I do have pictures of me playing it and it’s so funny – I think the guitar was taller than me. I didn’t get to start not selling guitars for food until I was like 30, so I lost all of the cool old stuff. Over the last 15 or 20 years or so, I’ve been just trying not to sell any of my old ones and just buying more new ones. I no longer sell guitars I already have so I can afford new ones – I just save up until I can afford it because the old guitars are important to me. I do have an unreasonable emotional attachment to some of my guitars. Brett Gurewitz (Bad Religion) \nMy first guitar was a Hohner. It was back in the 70s and Hohner is better known for making harmonicas. It was a beginner’s guitar. At the time I took some lessons from the local guitar shop. My first couple lessons I learned open chords and then somewhere around my third or fourth lesson I learned some bar chords. Then I bought a book called Chord Chemistry and every chord in the universe was in there. So I quit the lessons and just worked off of that book. Billy Howerdel (A Perfect Circle) \nI bought a Fender Squire Telecaster. It’s funny, I don’t do too much on social media but I just found the receipt from buying that guitar and put that on there. It was 310 dollars, I’ll never forget that. I got it on one of the music stores on 48th street in New York. I wound up selling it when I got more into metal stuff. It was a poor decision. Squires are more affordable but some of them are really great and that one was really great. I sold it to one of the teachers in my high school. Then I went and bought a BC Rich ST3 – the Strat because I wanted a wammy bar and more pickups and I just wanted the versatility. I could only afford to have one guitar so I wanted something that would do more things. I wound up putting different pickups in it and splitting the coils, just thirsty to get into things. But I regretted it – it felt like a downgrade of quality but it was an upgrade in accessibility. Then I wound up stripping all the paint off of it with a belt sander and drilling holes through it and then I started dipping it into liquid rubber, you know that stuff you put on screwdrivers to make the handles. So that guitar is sitting in my storage unit right now just sort of Frankensteined and half an art project. It actually plays OK. Keith Nelson (Buckcherry) \nMy first guitar was a 1972 Telecaster Custom that I got when I was 17. A kid in my neighborhood had it and he painted it with Van Halen stripes. So I bought that guitar from him, quickly stripped the finish off of it and painted it black. I was going for that Keith Richards Tele Custom look. That was the guitar that started me on the path to collecting old guitars. Peter Klett (Candlebox) \nI was a big Angus Young fan but my parents couldn’t afford the SG. But Yamaha made a double cutaway – Santana played them for years. And the first electric guitar I ever got was a cheap version of that. I loved it. I don’t have that guitar anymore. I got a version of it but it’s not the same one. I was walking down University and some kid came walking by with the exact same guitar that I had first had so I bought it for forty bucks or something like that. Richard Patrick (Filter, NIN) \nMy mom bought me a Global Les Paul copy at K-Mart. I Pete Townsend-ed that motherfucker as soon as I hit puberty. I wanted a Strat when I was young so I got a G&L Strat – Trent Reznor destroyed that. Then he bought me a Gibson Les Paul Standard in London which was ridiculous because it cost a fortune. I brought it back and used it and wrote “Hey Man Nice Shot” with it. So now I don’t use it that much but Dean (Deleo) loves it. Jonny Radtke (Filter, Ashes Divide, Kill Hannah) \nI bought myself my first Les Paul when I was 18 or 19 and I absolutely fell in love with it. It’s that Custom Alpine White Guitar. It was destroyed once actually on a flight. They wouldn’t let us carry it on board so they stowed it underneath the plane. We got to the venue; my tech opened it up and immediately was like “oh shit”. He brought it over to me and there was a boot print on the bridge and on the neck and on the headstock. So someone at the airlines opened up the case and purposely stomped my Les Paul. I was absolutely heartbroken. Then a friend of mine recommended a guy who specializes in fixing Les Pauls and he did an amazing job and when he heard the story he practically did it for free. And that’s the white Les Paul I still play today. Joe Hottinger (Halestorm) \nI do not have my first guitar [anymore]. My first electric was an Ibanez RG-270. I got it because it was green and I like the color green. I was in 7th grade. I traded that in for a Les Paul Studio which was a nice upgrade and I had that for a few years and then I traded that in for a PRS Custom 22. Then I traded that for an amplifier and a Tele. I traded that Tele to buy a ‘76 Strat. It went on and on like that. I still have my first guitar that I bought when I joined Halestorm which was just a Cherry SG. I still trade guitars and sell them occasionally in order to get something else. I recently traded two of my Strats and got that ‘56 Custom Hardtail Strat I was telling you about. Kyle Gass (Tenacious D, Kyle Gass Band) \nOh my God I had the sweetest fucking guitar that I wish I still had. It was this Guild Blonde Jumbo with the square inlays which I thought was the bomb. It wasn’t that expensive, I mean it was a lot for me at the time because I didn’t have any money but this was in the 70’s and I think I paid like $350 for it then. I loved it. I don’t know how I could have sold that. I guess I was poor and needed some money. Damn. Then I think my first electric was a hollow body Gibson 150 Stereo guitar. It had this weird stereo input where each string had its own signal. It was just one of those really bad ideas with no practical application. I don’t know how it worked. John Konesky (Tenacious D, KGB) \nI think my first guitar was from a grocery store and it was a Harmony acoustic. I think it was like $30 and it was very much a toy but it played. My parents said they wouldn’t just buy me a nice guitar. I had to show them that guitar was something I wanted to pursue. So I had to learn on that Harmony for like a year before they would entertain the idea of getting me a Squier Strat for my birthday, which was my first electric. I can still remember receiving the Squier and I knew I was getting it for Christmas or my birthday or whatever. But it was just insane; I get excited just thinking about it because that Harmony was hell to play. The action was so high, it was like a Dobro. Lukas Nelson (Neil Young, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan) \nI started out playing drums when I was 3 or 4. I really liked playing the drums and then I tried violin and trumpet and I could never really get into that. Eventually I migrated to the guitar when I was about 11. I played once in a while but I wasn’t very serious about it. Then my dad [Willie Nelson]’s birthday came along one year and I asked him what he wanted and he said that he wanted me to learn how to play guitar. So I buckled down and got serious and really fell in love with it and I played all the time. I started playing with my dad [Willie Nelson] about three years after he told me that he wanted me to learn how to play. By that point I had started to get pretty good. I was 13 or 14 and it just progressed from there. [My first guitar] was a Fender Stratocaster and I still have it somewhere. It was black and white. And from then on I’ve always had Strats. It’s just what Stevie Ray Vaughn and Hendrix used and I just loved that tone and after my first Strat, I got used to how the neck felt. I just put all of my heart into my Stratocaster and it became a vessel for me. Bill Kelliher (Mastodon) \nI was 15 when I got my first guitar and I started a band immediately. We played cover songs but soon started writing songs. You learn fast when all your friends are playing and you’ve got to try to keep up. It’s funny, I watch old video of me when I was 16 or 17 playing guitar and I was actually pretty good. I picked it up pretty fast. Metallica taught me. Slayer taught me. The Ramones taught me. I just listened to records a lot when I was a kid and stayed in my room and played along to everything. When you really want something bad enough, you do anything to get it. I’d play with friends who would give me pointers but my parents were going through a really bad divorce so they never paid attention to me. So I’d just go play in my room. I’d always tell them I wanted guitar lessons or that I wanted a guitar and they would just be like “yeah, yeah, yeah… you can take piano lessons.” That was when I was like five and it sucked. I hated it. I wanted a guitar. The guitar lessons never came. [My first guitar] was a StarForce; it was like a copy of Eddie Van Halen’s red and white Kramer, you know, the one with the red with the white tape on it. It was a copy of that. It [had] a whammy bar and it totally threw me off to ever using a whammy bar because every time I’d use it, the whole fucking guitar would go out of tune. I remember taking it in to different shops. It was actually a pretty good guitar. I think it was like $100, my dad said. But at the time it was great for me, I played the fuck out of it, man I wish I still had it. Back to the whammy bar thing, I remember changing the springs in the back and it was a floating tremolo but I put something so it would rest against it and wouldn’t go out to tune. So I decided that I didn’t like the guitar because it was always out of tune and I’d blame it on the tremolo. It was probably a cheap tremolo. Joey Santiago (Pixies) \nActually my first real guitar was an Ovation Viper, remember those things? They had a really odd shape, they had their own look. It was great because I was really young and it had a thin neck and the fret spacing wasn’t as wide, almost a short scale but not quite, it had 24 frets. It was a great guitar for a young kid. Unfortunately I lost it and Charles replaced it for me on my birthday. Robby Krieger (The Doors) \nI got my Ramirez Flamenco Guitar in 1963. I was in school and my dad was going to over to Spain. I had gotten into really enjoying listening to guitar at that time and I asked my dad if he’d check out this Ramirez shop in Madrid and he brought me back a Flamenco guitar. So I started taking flamenco lessons and I realized that I had a talent for it and that’s when I thought that maybe I could do it for a living. I was about 16 at that time. Josh Rand (Stone Sour) \nThe first guitar I ever got was a knockoff Fender Stratocaster, I got it when I was nine for Christmas. It was cool for that day and then it got put in a closet and eventually it got given away, I believe. Then when I started playing again, I played bass. I got a Squier Bass. Then when I started playing guitar again, the first guitar I got was an RG 560 that was black. I was quite a bit older that that time. Barry Stock (Three Days Grace) \nYeah I got a drum kit that someone gave me when I was like 12. We had a one stall garage at my parents’ house where I would bang away on that thing. My dad didn’t put up with that for very long. He didn’t like the drum racket so he bought me a guitar. When I started I had a bunch of older brothers so I’d sneak into their rooms and listen to their music. So I grew up on a lot of classic rock – Pink Floyd, early Aerosmith, Zepplin. But the first album that truly changed my life was the very first Black Sabbath album. I just remember that creepy cover, pulling the record out, putting it on and the storm came in, then those first power chords, the tri-tone, that changed my life. [That first guitar] was a Raven Telecaster copy. I remember it well. I really wish I still had it. Mike Poulson (Volbeat) \nOh yes, my first guitar I honestly don’t remember the name of it because it was a guitar I stole. It’s a funny story – I was in school and had a girlfriend who worked in a club after school which had a basement with a lot of music instruments. You know, boys will be boys and I was at that age where everything needs to be tried out so I was drinking and stealing and doing a lot of stupid stuff. So anyway, I saw that room and all those instruments and I so much wanted a guitar. So I left the window open, which she did not know anything about and during the night, me and one of my friends went down and stole an amp and a black guitar and brought it home. Well, my father was asking me where I got this stuff and I told him that I just borrowed it and was thinking about whether or not to buy it. Well, he saw right through me and asked where I would get the money to buy it and where did I get it. I just kept telling him that I borrowed it. But I felt so bad about it that the day after, I went back, went in the same window, replaced the guitar and amp and went back out again. I told my girlfriend that it was me who took the guitar and she was mad but was happy that I had returned it because I sensed somehow that my father knew something was wrong and at the end of the day I knew that it was not the right thing to do. So then I was trying to save up to buy my first guitar, I was probably 14 or so and I bought my first guitar from one of my friends who had stolen it from somewhere. So I bought it cheap. It was called a Maddox and I’ve never seen that guitar anywhere else ever but it says “Maddox” on the headstock. So that was the first guitar I ever bought and I still have it. Actually even though I have a lot of guitars, all the songs on all four Dominus albums were written on that guitar and the first 3 Volbeat records were written mostly by that guitar. It wasn’t until Beyond Hell/ Above Heaven and the new album that I decided to bury it in the attic. I’ll always keep it, it’s not a good guitar but it means something to me. So the last two records, I’ve been writing on a Gibson Goldtop at home. Brian Bell (Weezer) \nMy favorite guitar that I own is at this time my 1967 Telecaster Thinline which is all mahogany and it was the first expensive guitar I bought and the reason I bought it was that I had a trunk full of guitars in my car that was stolen at my house one night after a gig. I had a Fender Precision Bass, I had a Travis Bean Guitar which I played on a lot of the early Weezer albums – especially Pinkerton and that had SG Melody Maker pickups which I traded out for some Seymour Duncan Hot Rail pickups. That guitar meant a lot to me because it was “The Pinkerton Guitar” so I was devastated and Rivers told me, “why don’t you take this opportunity to buy the guitar you’ve always wanted?” and I’ve always wanted a good telecaster and I didn’t know anything about the Thinlines but I went into Voltage Guitars and I played this guitar. It was one of the first years that the Thinlines were made and it just had this great tone to it and I loved the way the neck felt. Usually that’s the first thing I look for in a guitar is how the neck feels. I bought that guitar for 3500 dollars. At the time it seemed so extravagant at the time but it’s worth more now. I never buy guitars purely for investment purposes but it’s nice to know that they do appreciate over time. Yngwie J. Malmsteen \nJustin: Let’s talk guitars. Why Strats? \nYngwie: Is there another guitar? \nJustin: It’s funny you mention that because I heard that Gibson made you a Stratocaster. Is that true? \nYngwie: They did. I am proud to say that before me there was nobody who got a free guitar from Fender. Hendrix and Blackmore, they had to buy their own guitar. I was the first guy who got a free guitar and I was the first guy to have his name on one, before Clapton. One of the reasons I think it happened that way was because when I came on the scene, Van Halen was all the rage. That almost resulted in the Stratocaster’s demise because in the late 70’s they weren’t being made very well. Also, they wanted to chop them up and put the humbuckers in them and stuff. Then my first album came out and the first thing you see on the cover is a Stratocaster. I was playing in California and the guys from Fender came to my show and said they wanted to make me a guitar. I thought they were joking because they never did that for anybody but they were actually serious. I sort of joked back with them and said, if they made me a guitar it has to be scalloped, knowing full well that making a scalloped neck in the factory would be super expensive. But I told them what I would want, sort of humoring them. They said they’d put my name on the guitar on top of the guitar – on the side of the body so that I could see it when I was playing. I told them no, that I wanted my name right on the fucking headstock next to the Stratocaster name. I was completely joking when I said that but they did it and that’s how all the signature models have been ever since. \nMy thing with the Stratocaster started when I was 6 or 7. That’s what I wanted because that’s what all the cool people used. My older brother had an electric guitar that looked like a Strat but it was like a toy almost. That was the only guitar I ever really wanted. The design is timeless – I actually have one of the first 10 ever made. I have other guitars – Les Pauls, Flying V’s, 335s, I’ve got shitloads of basses. I’ve got guitars that friends have given me like Brian May and Steve Vai. James Williamson (Iggy Pop, The Stooges) \nWhat really got me interested in playing guitar in the beginning was my sister bringing home Elvis Presley records. Then he went on the Ed Sullivan Show and everyone was huddled around the TV – he just looked so cool with that guitar and any young guy would have though, I want to be like that. So I had an uncle who worked for Sears in Roebuck, Texas. We had moved from Texas to Oklahoma and I finally decided that I would get the Sears discount and get a guitar the next time I went to visit and sure enough I got an old F-Hole Acoustic guitar from him. Of course the action was about an inch off the fretboard so it was really tough to play it but I had a guitar, you know. I decided that I better take some lessons because I had no idea what to do with it so I went down to a little music store if Lawton Oklahoma and took some lessons from a guy named Rusty McDonald. He got me to where I could play a couple of songs – one was “Good Old Mountain Dew” which was three or four chords and he had a local TV show so he brought me on the TV show and had me play and sing that. Next thing you know, girls are calling me up so I was thinking “hey I like this”. It turns out much later, in the last five or ten years someone pointed out to me that Rusty McDonald was actually pretty well known in his own right. He had toured with the Bob Wills Band as a singer and he’s the guy who recorded “Faded Love” for Bob Wills Band, his famous hit. So he had been touring extensively and had quite the musical background. He just didn’t like touring and he ended up settling in Lawton. So anyway I learned how to play a few chords from him. But what really got me going was when I moved to Michigan and the first summer I was there we moved next door to this family called the Blacks and all three of the kids could play instruments and sing. The oldest brother was college aged and had kind of a Kingston Trio style folk group. He wasn’t around but his brother was maybe a year or two older than me. So I hung out in his room all summer long and learned to play barre chords and he had an electric guitar. I ended up getting ok on that and ended up buying an electric myself. The rest of my career took off from there. Mark Morton (Lamb of God) \nMy first guitar was a nylon string classical guitar that was like $15 out of a newspaper or something. Shortly after that I got a Hondo, remember that brand? It was actually really pretty. It was an Explorer knockoff. I played that for a little while and realized it was a little uncomfortable so I got a Kramer Focus and I played that guitar for years. I do still have it. It’s in pieces but I still have it. I took it apart at one point with the intention of refinishing it and never put it back together. El Hefe (NOFX) \n[My first guitar was actually] my brother’s guitar, I found it in a closet, that was my first guitar but I didn’t own it. The first one I ever owned, I actually got a job working at a metal factory, saved up some money, and bought a candy apple red Flying V. It was a generic no name guitar. My first amp was a Yamaha G5. Kiko Loureiro (Megadeth) \nMy first guitar was a Brazilian cheap brand. It was like a black SG copy. My first professional guitar was an Ibanez RG 550. I bought that in 1989. I [still] have the SG, I never sold it because it was not a great guitar so it was just always kind of around, you know. I never really used it again but it’s just always been around. But the Ibanez was a good guitar. So I remember I sold the guitar years later, I used it a lot when I was really learning and practicing guitar a lot in my teenager times. I don’t remember why I sold it, but I sold it. Then maybe 15 years later I met a guy in a restaurant and the guy said “Remember me? I was your student. I bought your guitar, the Ibanez.” Then he said he still had it and I told him I wanted to buy it back. So I bought it back from him like maybe 15 years later. How super lucky because the guy was just in the restaurant and I never would have recognized the guy from back when I was teaching guitar. I didn’t even remember that I had sold it to a student. So now I have my first two guitars. I don’t play it anymore but I still do have the guitar for the memories. I really dedicated a lot of hours of playing on that guitar so it’s great to have it back. Now I keep my guitars, normally. Some people like to trade or sell them but I learned a lesson and now all the guitars I’ve recorded with, I keep them. I’m not a collector but I like to keep the guitar if it has some relation to my history somehow. Scott Hendrick (Skeletonwitch) \nIt was a Vantage. I’m a lefty, by the way, so it’s harder for me to find guitars. I went into a guitar shop wanting to learn how to play but having never held one before. I picked up a guitar left handed and they tried to get me to turn it around but I was like, “No this is how I’m going to play it” So they said, “Oh then you need this guitar over here” and it was the only left handed guitar they had. I think it was like $150 or something like that. It came with an amp and a gig bag, a book, and a bunch of pick. It was a starter package driftwood guitar. But I learned how to play on that guitar and I loved it. I still have it. It’s a pretty shitty guitar but it has sentimental value. John 5 (Rob Zombie, Marylin Manson) \n[I’ve always used Telecasters] It’s just like an old pair of shoes and it just works so well for me. It really does, for some reason. I guess watching Hee Haw, I thought that was the only electric guitar there was. I knew I wanted to play electric guitar and I just thought that was the only guitar – I thought that electric guitars only came in one shape and you could get different colors but this is what an electric guitar looked like and that stayed in my brain and I think that’s why I love them today.
