where we do most of our shopping, and a solid 90% of it is done at Amazon. Jeff Bezos has turned his humble bookstore into a sort of Automat of the digital age, selling everything from soup to nuts at low prices with speedy shipping. Nobody knows Amazon deals quite like we do. Except for you, that is. Welcome to Prime Directive, where we find the coolest things on Amazon.com and feed them to you, one at a time.\n1/3/2017 Iron Monkey\nWe’ve got plenty of bones to pick with Nickelodeon, who have pumped out a geyser of absolute crap programming in the last few decades. But they still manage to land in our good graces for airing Avatar: The Last Airbender , probably the best action-adventure cartoon of this generation. This show was a strong throwback to classic 80s adventures like Thundarr the Barbarian but with a strong anime influence, and if you’ve never seen it there’s no time like the present.\nWhat made Avatar so great? For one, it was dedicated to its characters and gave them room to breathe and grow over the course of three seasons. The martial arts sequences are also well-researched and true to life. It won a damn Emmy Award, for God’s sake. Don’t go in thinking that Avatar is just for kids or weeaboos. It’s solidly one of the best shows of the 2000s. Please just forget the M. Night Shyamalan film version, though. That thing was a Goddamned mess.\n$28.20 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n1/2/2017 Iron Monkey\nWe’re starting a new year here at Prime Directive and our resolution is to keep things insanely positive, sharing something we absolutely love from Amazon every single day and even giving you a little bit of background story to go with it. Let’s do it!\nAfter watching Rogue One for the third time, the one question we had was “why isn’t Donnie Yen a bigger star over here?” He’s one of the most legit martial artists to ever work in the HK film industry, and his dynamic personality and solid English skills seem tailor-made for crossover success. He’s set to play the villain in the upcoming XXX sequel, but if you really want to see what he can do, check out 1993’s brilliant Iron Monkey\nBest described as a Chinese take on Batman , the flick tells the tale of a masked figure fighting against a corrupt governor. Yen plays the traveling martial artist blackmailed into taking him down, and then we’re off to the fireworks factory with some of the hottest fight scenes ever lensed. This one’s an underrated classic that you need to see.\n$24.95 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/30/2016 Desktop Tesla Coil Kit\nIt was pretty hard to settle on the last Amazon deal we’d bring you in 2016. This has been a year unlike any we can remember, filled with triumphs and tragedies, and summing it all up in a single product was a daunting task. Do we pay tribute to those we lost, or look towards the future? Do we go for entertainment or education? At the end of the day, only one choice was clear: do it all.\nThe Tesla coil is one of the most iconic symbols of geekdom, celebrating a scientist who was unpopular in his own time but history has proven to be a genius. And this do-it-yourself Tesla coil kit also celebrates one of the most important facets of the geek identity: we’re hands-on. We build what we love. End the year by firing up this 220v arc of electricity at your desk and send some charge off into the ether for an electrifying New Year.\n$149.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/29/2016 Star Trek: Ascendancy\nWe’re doing board games in December, and we’re also doing Star Trek for some reason, so let’s close this out by combining two great things into one. One of our favorite tabletop experiences in 2016 was Star Trek: Ascendancy , a massive game of exploration, expansion and conflict that lets you play the Federation, the Klingons or the Romulans. Each game is different because the layout of planets and space routes is modular, giving it tons of replayability.\nIf you’re a fan of classic computer 4x strategy like Master Of Orion , this is going to scratch that itch perfectly. It’s quite possibly the most complex and deep Star Trek board game ever produced. Amazon has Ascendancy for an insane 30% off, so what are you waiting for?\n$69.62 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/28/2016 Amazing Fantastic Incredible: A Marvelous Memoir\n94 years ago today, the earth rumbled, the heavens quaked, a geyser of cosmic energy erupted from the sun and a baby named Stanley Martin Lieber entered the world. You wouldn’t know it from looking at him, but that baby would go on to become one of the most influential figures in geek culture of all time. Stan Lee, as the child would be known, is obviously the co-creator of the majority of the Marvel universe, and his slick patter and down-to-earth concerns transformed superheroes in the 60s like never before.\nLast year Lee released his memoir, Amazing Fantastic Incredible , and it’s exactly what you would expect from the legendary self-promoter: a breathless recounting of his words and deeds that is illustrated by the great Colleen Doran. There are dozens of weird, funny tales from the early days of Marvel here, and it’s a must-buy for any comics buff. Excelsior!\n$20.40 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/27/2016 Star Trek: The Complete Original Series\nThe TV debut we’re looking forward to most in 2017 is probably Star Trek: Discovery , the first new Trek series in a decade, over 50 years after the original first set off on its mission. As you’d guess from the title, Discovery is all about exploring strange new worlds, seeking out new life and new civilizations, and boldly going where no man has gone before.\nBrush up on your Trek lore with this insanely cheap Blu-Ray box set of the original series, which lays the foundation for the Federation, the Klingons, the Romulans, and thousands of other pieces of Star Trek world-building that will be important come January when Discovery hits the airwaves.\n$64.22 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/26/2016 ODiN Aurora Projection Mouse\nAnd with the sun rising this Monday, Christmas season is over. We hope you got absolutely everything you wanted, because we’re about to show you things you never knew you could live without. Commerce never sleeps, people, and neither do we. Are you getting pissed of by the relative low-techness of your mouse or touchpad? Step into the future with us and the ODiN Aurora Projection Mouse.\nPlug this puppy (which looks a lot like a Transformer head) in and it’ll use lasers to “draw” a trackpad on any surface, and then use any pointing device, finger included, to interact with it. It’s remarkably user-friendly once you get the hang of it and, by encouraging flat hand positioning, can help prevent the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. Plus it’s a dang robot head that shoots lasers at your desk, what more do you want?\n$69.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/23/2016 Scythe\nWe’ve been spending the month of December spotlighting some of the best board games you can find on Amazon, and right before Christmas we want to share with you one of the best we played all year. Scythe is a brilliant, wildly replayable strategy game from Stonemaier Games. Set in an alternate history 1920s where players take control of factions seeking to rebuild and conquer a devastated Europe. The game design is fantastic, with an emphasis on building “engines” to give you granular control over your strategy.\nIt’s a wildly fun game with great production values, but it’s not for the strategically inept – you need to be able to think several steps ahead to play at a high level, and there are so many different paths to victory that mastering a couple of them is a necessity. This one’s very deserving of a place in your collection.\n104.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/22/2016 Black Christmas\nEvery family has its own Christmas movie tradition. Some watch A Christmas Story , some watch Die Hard , but around our way we swear by the sleazy 1974 slasher flick Black Christmas , about a sorority house being terrorized by a homicidal maniac in their attic. It’s a tense and grimy experience in the way that the 70s did so well, and features Margot Kidder in one of her early breakthrough roles.\nOrder it today and you can have this beautiful Blu-Ray transfer at your door before Christmas Eve. Join us in this bloodiest of traditions, won’t you?\n$29.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/21/2016 Captain America Omnibus\nIt’s been a tough few months for the American Dream. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are all under threat by enemies both foreign and domestic, and even the core systems of our government are being torn down around us. So for today’s deal, we look back to December 21, 1940, when the first issue of Captain America Comics hit the stands by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Marvel’s flag-emblazoned hero has always stood for the best in us (well, except for right now when he’s a covert HYDRA agent, but that’ll get cleared up soonish), and delving back into his history can remind us what we should hold dear.\nThis massive hardcover collection boasts a whopping 856 full-color pages of peak Cap adventure by Stan Lee, Roy Thomas, Jack Kirby, Jim Steranko and more. It’s peak Marvel muscle, full of dynamic storytelling and way-out villains.\n$125.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/20/2016 Airzooka\nIf your office is anything like Geek headquarters, you’re in a constant non-lethal annoyance battle against your cubicle mates using whatever you can get your hands on. But the real problem with Nerf guns and the like is that a wise foe will confiscate your ammunition after you fire it, depleting your ability to strike from a distance. How to solve this issue? How about with a desk weapon that strikes with the air itself?\nThe Airzooka is a brilliant creation that blasts a “ball” of pressurized air as far as 50 feet, causing deep, potent annoyance but no permanent damage. Aim it at a stack of important TPS reports if you really want to be a dick, but it’s best used to tap the back of a co-worker’s head from across the room. It even has pop-up sights so you can line up that perfect shot. Make 2017 a year of advanced office warfare by using the elements themselves like some sort of prankster warlock.\n$22.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/19/2016 Rick & Morty Season 1\nWhat was the most mindf*cking show on TV in 2016? Was it Westworld ‘s tricky dance between robots and humans, the future and the past? Was it Black Mirror jumping back into the dark heart of technology? Trick question, dumbass. It was Rick & Morty , and it will always be Rick & Morty . Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland’s animated take on the Back to the Future partnership blew out of the gate with a second season that steadily built on itself to deliver both insane laughs and serious brain-melting.\nWhile we wait for the third season to drop, why not reacquaint yourself with how it all started, or spread the love to somebody who hasn’t hopped on board? Twenty five bucks for the whole first season on crystal-clear Blu-Ray is an insanely good deal. Snap it up, sucker.\n$24.96 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/16/2016 One Punch Man Volume 1\nIf there’s one fictional character that came to define 2016 for us, it’s Saitama, the titular protagonist of cult hit manga One Punch Man . In a world clogged to the gills with superheroes, each one boasting a magnificent (or sometimes idiotic) power, he’s just an ordinary guy who did 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats and ran 10 kilometers a day until he was the strongest being on Earth. Saitama’s capable of knocking out any foe with just one blow, but the series is about his existential boredom with the hero business.\nMany, many volumes are available in English but you gotta jump on this one right at the beginning. The art is top-notch, with the contrast between Saitama’s goofy, plain appearance and the intense monsters drawn by Yusuke Murata a high point. This manga is just a pile of fun from start to finish and will make you dedicate yourself even harder to your New Year’s resolution to get in shape. 100 push-ups doesn’t sound that bad right now.\n$8.45 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/15/2016 10x10x10 Speed Cube Puzzle\nYou consider yourself a smart person, right? You must, because you’re reading this site and we don’t dumb it down for the normies. So, like most smart people, you probably enjoyed a period of Rubik’s Cube solving in your past. The Cube is a fascinating test of someone’s mental ability, as there are multiple tiers of mastery. First you get a handle on the essential mechanics of it, solving through brute force and experimentation. Then you master the underlying mathematics like Neo in The Matrix to optimize your movements. And finally, you graduate to “speed cubing,” restoring the sides in as short a time as possible.\nYou’ve got that down with a standard Rubik’s Cube. Now it’s time to go big. This patently insane 10x10x10 Speed Cube Puzzle is the Godzilla of color cubes, 100 squares on each side of solving pain. Measuring nearly a foot on each side, this is an engineering marvel that would be just as good as a display object in your house if you eventually give up on finishing it.\n$79.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/14/2016 E-Element 104 PBT Double Shot Injection Backlit Golden Metal Color Keycaps\nWe’re not going to insult your intelligence and pretend you haven’t upgraded to a mechanical keyboard for your battlestation. There’s nothing more satisfying than that old-school clacking sound, and the response time is far superior for gaming. So what’s the next step to really trick that baby out? Gold keycaps, of course.\nNo, these aren’t actual gold – we don’t think you’re playing with Donald Trump money, after all – but they’re blinged out as all hell and they’ll look insanely good on your keyboard. There are a number of different ways you could deploy these puppies. To go seriously luxe, do every key with them. Or for an accent, just replace the arrow keys or WASD. Maybe just the number pad if you’re a hard-core data processor? The possibilities are endless, and at just $25 you’d be nuts not to snap up this deal.\n$24.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/13/2016 Funko Pop Wolfman\nDifferent monsters like different times of the year. The Creature from the Black Lagoon and Jason Voorhees are summer hunters, for instance. But when there’s snow on the ground, that’s the Wolf Man’s time to shine. On December 13, 1941, one of the most influential monster movies in history hit theaters – Curt Siodmak’s The Wolf Man , starring Lon Chaney Jr. as the titular lycanthrope. Chaney’s take on the hairy killer, ably aided by makeup artist Jack Pierce, defined the beast going forward.\nPay tribute to Chaney with this sweet-ass Universal Monsters Funko Pop, taking the actor’s befurred visage and cutesifying it into a desk decoration with a bobbling head that thirsts for blood. While we’re not the biggest Funko Pops fan, there’s no denying that this one is pretty awesome.\n$16.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/12/2016 Camp Grizzly\nIt’s cold outside, so you know what that means: bust out the board games. We committed to bringing you hot deals on some of our favorites this month, so let’s throw a little light on a recent release that hits all of our sweet spots. Camp Grizzly , from Ameritrash Games, melds survival horror and semi-cooperative strategy into a game that’s a blast to play. Each player controls a counselor at the titular camp while avoiding Otis, the seemingly unstoppable serial killer.\nThe game’s basic rules are simple, but things get heated with the introduction of Cameos – extra characters that can totally upset your carefully-crafted plans for survival. Otis also gets stronger the more people he kills, so play becomes more and more tense as the game grinds on. It’s a hell of a lot of fun, especially when you’re snowed in and the power goes out. Wait, did you hear a noise from the basement? Don’t worry, I’ll go check alone without a flashlight. I’m sure it’s just a possum.\n$50.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/9/2016 Minimalist Silver Surfer Shirt\nI’m re-reading the classic Stan Lee and Jack Kirby run on Fantastic Four , as you do when you want to see the origin of pretty much every superhero comics trope, and I just got to the epic Galactus saga. The team had faced ultra-powerful aliens before, but nothing like the Eater of Worlds. Less a character than a force of nature, Galactus marked the beginning of the Cosmic Age of comics, and he was preceded by his herald, one of the most noble of Lee and Kirby’s creations: the Silver Surfer.\nOn December 9th, 1965, Fantastic Four #48 gave us our first glimpse of Norrin Radd of Zenn-La, better known as the Silver Surfer. We’re going to assume you already have that material, so why not go in a different direction with this sweet T-shirt? While most superhero shirts are a little… over the top, shall we say, this minimalist design is hipster friendly and still expresses your inner geek bonafides. Just don’t yell “To me, my board!” when you request an Uber.\n$11.50-$32.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/8/2016 ALF: The Complete Series\nThe prospect of first contact with aliens gets more and more minute as we learn just how big the universe is and how unflinching the laws of physics seem to be. For a sentient life form to bridge the massive gap between their habitable planet and ours would take either an insanely long amount of time or an engine unlike any our science can comprehend. That’s sad news for 80s kids who grew up with ALF , the cult sitcom about a cat-eating alien who comes to live with a suburban California family.\nOriginally aired on NBC, you can get all four seasons of the show in a snappy box set from Amazon. While the jokes still hold up, ALF is also a cool geek time capsule to the state of space exploration in the Bush years. Some episodes dealt with then-current NASA discoveries, so if you’re nostalgic for the days when Pluto was a planet, it’ll give you the warm fuzzies.\n$39.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/7/2016 20 Grams Of Gallium\nAmazon started off selling just one thing: books. And they sold a lot of books, so they decided to start selling CDs and DVDs. And they sold a lot of those, so they decided to start selling all kinds of other crap, too, and now we’re in the modern era where you can send away for 20 grams of 99.99% pure gallium as easy as ordering a pizza.\nWhat is gallium? It’s a fascinating metal that barely qualifies as one, having the second-largest “liquid range” of any metal. That means it flows like sticky pudding at room temperature, but quickly hardens and becomes brittle when it cools a tiny bit. As it freezes, it also expands like water, which is unusual in a metal. What are you going to do with it? Whatever the hell you want, buddy! It corrodes other metals, leaves indelible gray markings on nearly any surface, and refuses to crystallize, making it fun to make fragile duplicates of other items.\n$11.80 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/6/2016 Doctor Who: Whographica\nOn December 6, 1989, one of the most important sagas in science fiction history came to a close. That was the air date for the very last episode of the original Doctor Who series, which reached 26 seasons on the BBC after premiering in 1963. That’s 26 years, if you can’t do that Time Lord math. It’d be another decade and change before the occupant of the Tardis made his return to the airwaves, but a lot of plot happened in those 26 years.\nThe Who timeline is insanely difficult to follow, and you could certainly print out a million Wikipedia pages and read them on the toilet, but we have a better way. Meet Whographica , a seriously badass 224 page collection of charts, tables and graphics that put the show’s entire run into perspective. It’s an incredible way to look at all of this lore visually. We recommend it highly.\n$12.81 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/5/2016 Fast & Furious 7-Movie Collection\nWho would have thought that the Fast & Furious series would somehow become the most beloved action movie franchise in the world? What started out as a simple tale of street racers and hijacking in 2001 has ballooned into a massive cinematic universe that crosses the globe multiple times to give us some of the most batcrap crazy stunts ever put on film. And it’s fair to argue that the series was an important stepping stone towards making Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson one of the most popular movie stars in the world.\nWant to watch this remarkable evolution take place through seven films of twisted steel and sex appeal? You’re in luck. We found an insane deal on Blu-Ray versions of the entire series to date for just 28 bucks – four dollars a film. That’s cheaper than a matinee. Pop some nitro in your system and get ready to live your life a quarter-mile at a time for the next 14 hours or so.\n$27.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/2/2016 Five Nights At Freddy’s Backstage Construction Set\nThe Five Nights At Freddy’s phenomenon is one of the most unlikely success stories of the last decade. A hinky indie game made by a fundamentalist Christian about working nights at a pizza parlor somehow transformed itself into a huge cultural phenomenon with multiple sequels, a book, and even an upcoming movie. Oh, and of course there’s toys. From MacFarlane, the industry leader in disturbingly realistic plastic, you can now have your own miniature backstage area to look at in terror while you work.\nThis 153-piece construction set lets you build the workspace where the malfunctioning animatronics hang out, and comes with a Withered Chica figure as well as a spare endoskeleton and a bunch of character heads. It’s one of several construction sets for the game from MacFarlane, but this one is our favorite.\n$26.98 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/1/2016 Turbo Kid Soundtrack\nOne of the few good developments in this hell century has been a new appreciation for the balls-out low-budget sci-fi action flicks of the late 1980s and early 1990s. That was a glorious time for practical effects and buckets of blood. One of our absolute favorite throwback films of 2015 was Turbo Kid , which took equal parts Mad Max and Mega Man and threw them in a blender to create a gory, wild and emotionally affecting story of love and heroism in the wasteland.\nYou can stream that movie for free on Netflix so we’re not going to make you buy it here, but what you really should get is the absolutely luxurious collector’s edition soundtrack by Le Matos. Limited to just 1000 copies, this 2x 180 black vinyl record set contains the film’s complete music in a glorious package. Any fans of John Carpenter or 80s synthpop needs to have this in their library.\n$42.29 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/30/2016 Magnus Robot Fighter: Flesh And Steel\nIf you want to talk about one of the most serious paranoias of the modern age, being replaced by a robot is right up there. With Westworld dominating the geek conversation, it might be nice to look back at one of the more influential man vs. robot comics of the last century – Gold Key’s Magnus, Robot Fighter , created by Russ Manning and first hitting newsstands on November 30, 1963. The tunic-wearing martial artist practiced a discipline that let him smash steel with his bare hands, and the character has survived in various forms from various publishers.\nDynamite bought the rights to Magnus and a few other Gold Key characters in 2013 and rebooted the title, and it’s been a fun read so far. Magnus now lives in a world with deceptively humanlike robots integrated into regular society, and both sides are equally complicit in bad deeds. It’s a solid 12-issue run that you can get into at a good price.\n$12.85 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/29/2016 Xtronaut\nWinter is most definitely board game season, and all throughout the next month or so we’ll be highlighting some new favorites and old classics to play with family and friends. Let’s start off with a recently Kickstarted game that scratches just about every one of our geek itches. It’s a seriously techy take on space exploration called Xtronaut from the leader of the NASA OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission.\nHere’s how it works: each player is the director of a launch complex, struggling to complete their mission before other players do. You can take part in all the political and financial intrigue of the real-life space program, as well as collaborate and betray other players. The basic rules are simple to learn but the game has a ton of depth and replayability. Add it to your collection before the snow hits.\n$29.74 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/28/2016 Livid Minim Wireless Controller\nIt’s never been easier to make music for fun and profit. Gone are the days of painstakingly learning how to play an instrument, replaced by electronic gadgets and gew-gaws that let us conjure any sound in the world at the press of a button. If you want to get in on this racket – and really, why shouldn’t you – you’re going to need some hardware. Meet the Livid Minim Wireless Controller. This unique device links up wirelessly with an iOS app to let you craft all kinds of music with just your fingers.\nWe like the Livid Minim for a few reasons. First and foremost is the seriously 90s retro industrial design – it looks like something Alpha would use on Power Rangers , all pastel neons and beveled edges. Second is the user-friendly nature of the hardware. Eight big pads and fifteen buttons give you enough space to experiment without overloading you with options. It also has 3D motion control, so you can modify your sound simply by picking the thing up and changing its position. Audio pros are giving it unanimously good reviews, and at this price how can you go wrong?\n$129.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/24/2016 World’s Largest Gummi Worm\nIf you’re anything like most Americans, today is the day when you gorge yourself on turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing and other traditional Thanksgiving dishes. And looming on the horizon is one of the most dreaded events on the calendar: the post-Thanksgiving potluck. Everybody brings their leftovers over and they’re glumly picked over by people who have been eating the same stuff for days.\nBe the hero of your next potluck by showing up with something completely unexpected: a three pound gummi worm. This massive hunk of slithering sweetness is deeply disturbing looking but apparently tastes great. The product description on Amazon reads as follows:\n– blue\n– gummy & Chewy candy\n– Great taste\n– fresh\nHow can you argue with that?\n$23.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/23/2016 Lot Of 100 Comic Books\nEven though in the modern era you can get just about any comic book ever published digitally streamed to your PC, tablet or phone, there’s nothing that will replace the feeling of sitting down with a stack of single issues. There’s no way to replace feeling the slick cover stock on your fingers, and breathing in the smell of ink. One of the most treasured geek traditions is the proverbial “dollar box” at comic conventions, a massive trove of back issues you can pick through for bargain-priced hidden treasures.\nIf there’s no con near you, replicate the experience on Amazon by buying a random box of miscellaneous comics for 60 cents apiece. Sure, some are likely to be junk, but odds are good you’ll discover a title you missed, a new favorite character, or something weird enough to scan and post to Twitter. This was the way our nerd ancestors consumed comics, and you owe it to yourself to do the same at least once.\n$60.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/22/2016 Jamie Lee Curtis Action Figure\nWhen we think about actresses who have earned and kept geek cred for their entire careers, Jamie Lee Curtis is near the top of the list. From making her debut in the first Halloween movie to her going undercover in Vega cosplay to Street Fighter tournaments, she’s been keeping it 100 for decades. And if you’re not enjoying Jamie gloriously chewing scenery on Scream Queens , you have no soul at all.\nOddly enough, for an actress who has been in so many sci-fi and horror movies, Curtis doesn’t have that many action figures of herself. We have to turn to 1999’s Virus , based on an indie comic, for the best one. Luckily for us, Amazon has literally everything, so you can still pick one up. It comes with a bunch of accessories, like any good action figure does.\n$11.05 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/21/2016 Nintendo New 3DS XL Special Edition: Lime Green\nIt’s a big month for video game anniversaries, and today is no exception. On November 21, 2004, Nintendo unleashed the original DS in America – before it hit Japan. The first entry in company president Satoru Iwata’s “Gaming Population Expansion” plan, it was a shot across the bow to the hardcore. A stylus-based touchscreen created a whole new input paradigm and made more casual games like Brain Age a possibility. The console was a massive hit, with over 3 million preorders, and went through a number of stylistic and hardware evolutions.\nThe latest iteration is the New Nintendo 3DS, and if you don’t have one, it’s a great time to snap one up. Amazon has a special edition lime green model of the portable console that comes with Super Mario World pre-installed. We dig the funky coloration, and the hardware has an insanely deep library of games, both first-party stuff like Mario Maker and third-party titles like Monster Hunter: Generations .\n$199.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/18/2016 Cryptex USB Flash Drive\nThere are lots of lessons to be learned from the just-completed 2016 elections, but one of the most important is already well-known by geeks: you’ve got to protect your data. Hillary Clinton’s private email server and the Wikileaks of John Podesta’s emails made the candidate look like she didn’t know swift about security, and with the Russians gleefully hacking everything they could get their digital fingers into that wasn’t a smart move. So how do you keep your bits and bytes on lockdown?\nOne old-fashioned but cool-looking way is with the Cryptex USB Flash Drive. This 16GB portable storage unit comes encased in a steampunk-style combination lock that keeps it protected from anyone that doesn’t know the five digit code. Created from designs by Leonardo da Vinci, this thing probably won’t solve all your data security needs, but it’s stylish as hell and an awesome conversation piece.\n$47.95 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/17/2016 LEGO Star Wars Advent Calendar\nGeorge Lucas had no idea that Star Wars would become the cultural juggernaut that it did. That’s the only explanation we can give for the Star Wars Holiday Special , a bizarre low-budget oddity that premiered on CBS on November 17, 1978. The hour-long show is notable for the first appearance of Boba Fett (in animated form), but what most people remember is the bizarre musical numbers, celebrity guests like Bea Arthur and Chewbacca’s weird family. It was only aired once and then buried in the Lucasfilm vaults.\nTo celebrate the season in a little bit cooler way, snag this sweet LEGO Star Wars advent calendar from Amazon. For each of the 24 days of December leading up to Christmas, open a door to reveal a different LEGO minifig or vehicle, including an exclusive holiday variant you can’t get anywhere else. While we wait for Rogue One , we’ll need to scratch our Star Wars itch somehow, and this is as good a way as any.\n$61.97 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/16/2016 Night Of The Comet\nEverybody has their personal cult classic movies that they force on friends and acquaintances. On November 16, 1984, one of our favorites hit theaters for the first time. Night Of The Comet is a unique and bizarre combination of two cultural touchstones of the era: zombie horror and Valley Girl comedies. And it works!\nWhen a comet that passes Earth every 65 million years catches our planet in its tail, the majority of the population is either reduced to dust or transformed into murderous zombies. Only a handful of people who were protected from its effects remain to figure out what the hell happened, including a pair of teenage sisters.\nIf you haven’t seen it, Night of the Comet will make you look at shows like The Walking Dead in a new way. Sure, it delivers on the horror and shock, but it never loses sight of its own humanity. It’s a great flick and one that you should add to your collection.\n$19.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/15/2016 Halo: The Master Chief Collection\nWhen the original Xbox hit store shelves in the United States on November 15th, 2001, most people thought Microsoft was crazy. Getting into the hardware business, and competing with market-crushing juggernauts Nintendo, Sony and Sega? Even with their deep pockets, there was no way they could make it work.\nAnd for the most part, they were right. The first Xbox was a disaster. Horrible form factor, nightmarish UI, and a third-rate software library consigned the console to the bottom of the heap. But even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while, and that nut was the original Halo: Combat Evolved . Bungie’s attempt to make first-person shooters work on a console was a tremendous success, selling over five million copies. The sequel, also on the original Xbox, moved over eight million. And a new franchise was born.\nCelebrate fifteen years of Xbox gaming with Halo: The Master Chief Collection , taking the first four games in the series and giving them a current-gen graphical and audio upgrade. The insane amount of content in this package will probably keep you busy for the next fifteen years.\n$26.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/14/2016 Red Sonja: Queen Of Plagues\nIf you think about underrated comics from the last fifty years or so, Marvel’s Conan the Barbarian book has to be up there. While Marvel’s superhero universe was growing, Roy Thomas and John Buscema kept sword-swinging fantasy action alive for decades. One of the most culture-defining moments that came out of the series happened on November 14 in the pages of Conan the Barbarian #23. That’s when we first glimpsed the She-Devil with a Sword, Red Sonja. The crimson-haired barbarian quickly grew in popularity and soon snagged her own book as well.\nWhile the character’s rights have bounced around publishers since then, we have to give props to Dynamite Entertainment for rebooting her with a female writer at the helm. Gail Simone’s take on Sonja doesn’t skimp on the chainmail bikini or the violence, but also portrays her as a strategic genius and a serious threat on the battlefield. Simone’s run was one of the best fantasy comics of the last few years, so get in on the ground floor with this TPB collecting the first six issues.\n$12.81 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/11/2016 Playing With Power: Nintendo NES Classics\nToday’s the date when the NES Classic Edition hits store shelves, but you’re a geek, you probably already pre-ordered it. If you’re a true retro gaming fan, though, you should carve out a space on your bookshelf for this handsome hardcover volume that pays tribute to some of the console’s greatest game,\nPlaying With Power: Nintendo NES Classics is crammed with artwork and information on 17 NES titles, as well as complete walkthroughs and strategy guides. If you pick up a Classic Edition, you’re probably going to get stuck because some of those 8-bit titles are obtuse and hard as hell. Sure, you can log on to GameFaqs or whatever, but if you really want the authentic experience, this book (which comes in a sweet-ass slipcase that looks like a NES Game Pak) is a must-buy.\n$26.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/10/2016 Boomer The Foot Mouse\nWe freaking love bizarre computer peripherals. A whole closet at Geek HQ is crammed to the gills with quirky keyboards, unusual USB devices and customized mice. But we’ve gotta say that Boomer the Foot Mouse has us feeling pretty envious. This hilarious-looking input device lets you use your tootsies to move a cursor around. We’re not 100% sure how much latency Boomer has, but the idea of using our feet to aim in Overwatch is so ridiculously funny that we’re going to order one just to try it out.\nThe manufacturer says that Boomer is great for “doctors, surgeons, dentists” or anyone who needs to do something with their hands white they compute. The discs on the top are made of elastomer rubber so you can take them off and clean them easily, and anti-skid pads prevent it from traveling across the floor. It’s even Bluetooth-compatible. This is easily the weirdest damn mouse we’ve ever seen in our lives. You should buy one.\n$895.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/9/2016 SAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere\nIf you’re freaking out after last night’s… events, you might be considering packing a bug-out bag and making a new life off the grid, away from other human beings entirely. But one mark of a true geek is that we always do our homework, so before you doomsday prep, get some reading done. John “Lofty” Wiseman was the youngest person to ever pass the admissions test for Britain’s Special Air Services, and he served with them for 26 years through numerous operations.\nDuring his time there, Wiseman accumulated a library’s worth of information on surviving in the wild, and in this book he lays it all out for you. The SAS Survival Handbook has all the tips you need for making it work in a variety of hostile environments, including how to track and kill animals, make secure campsites, navigate by the sun and moon and recognize poisonous plants. It’s the essential manual for keeping your crap together when the world ends, and with Amazon Prime you can have it in your hands tomorrow.\n$12.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/8/2016 Chuck’s Living Object Tinglers: Volume 3\nNovember 8th is a day of true horror. No, not because the fate of the free world hangs in the balance of the most ridiculous American Presidential election ever. It’s actually the birthday of one of the most influential horror writers of all time. Abraham “Bram” Stoker came out of the womb on November 8, 1847. 50 years later he produced his most famous work, the gothic novel Dracula that kicked off a wave of imitators and basically defined everything we know about vampires.\nBut just as the 90s were the time for Klax, the 2010s are the time for a new breed of author. One with an equally vivid imagination. A humble man from Billings, Montana named Chuck Tingle. And wouldn’t you know it, Chuck has even penned one of his trademark “tinglers” about blood-sucking creatures of the night. Vampire Night Bus Pounds My Butt is one of three stories in this bargain-priced volume that will chill you to the bone and keep you warm on election night.\n$6.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/7/2016 Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series\nAll the normies are getting into Westworld , HBO’s new sci-fi prestige drama that examines what happens when human-looking artificial intelligence gets a little big for its britches. But true geeks walked down this road ten years ago when a couple of guys brought B-level sci-fi TV show Battlestar Galactica back as one of the most thought-provoking and influential shows of the 21st century.\nThere are a lot of parallels between the two properties – Westworld was also a significantly cornier movie in 1973, for example. And people had lots of wild theories and ideas about where things were going. But while you have to wait week after week for HBO to drip out new episodes, you can watch the whole damn thing of Galactica right now. This 20 disc box set is crammed to the gills with bonuses and special features. With a running time of 4179 minutes (or about three straight days), it’ll certainly do the job.\n$114.95 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/4/2016 Kotobukiya “Armored Core” Rayleonard 04 Alicia Unsung D-Style Model Kit\nMost days we try to tie in the Amazon Prime pick to something happening in the real world, just to give you a little context for your shopping. But sometimes you just want to buy a cool-ass robot without any hassle. We got you, buddy.\nAs the weather gets cooler and outdoor activities become significantly less fun, we must return to the geek hobbies of our ancestors. It is our true belief that if you’ve never assembled a Japanese mecha model, you’re missing an important punch on your geek card. Amazon has a bevy of sweet-ass Gundam and the like to choose from, but this is a site for the hardcore, and no game is more hardcore than Armored Core .\nCreated by From Software (the Dark Souls guys), Armored Core has been delivering intense mech combat action since 1997, and the robot designs have evolved to be some of the most badass in the business. This Rayleonard is a great pick for a newbie model builder, as it looks fricking sweet but doesn’t have an insane number of little fiddly bits to keep track of. A warning, though: once you get bit by the mecha model bug, it won’t stop until your desk is a battlefield of mechanical carnage.\n$28.04 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/3/2016 Death Wish Coffee\nNovember 3rd marks the birthday of one of the most stoic movie badasses of all time, Charles Bronson. Born Charles Dennis Buchinsky in Pennsylvania coal country, the craggy-faced Bronson was the first member of his family to graduate high school and moved to New York City after serving in WWII to pursue a career on the stage. Bronson’s breakthrough role was in 1960’s The Magnificent Seven , and after that he was regularly cast as badasses out for revenge, most notably in the 80s vigilante fantasy Death Wish movies.\nIt’s with those movies that we segue into today’s deal: sixteen ounces of Death Wish coffee, certified to be the strongest java you can brew. This organic, fair trade blend boasts a caffeine payload around 660 mg per 12 ounce cup, or twice the amount of normal drip coffee. That’ll give you the buzz you need to blow away punks on the subway, no problem.\n$18.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/2/2016 Dr. Strange Omnibus\nStan Lee gets most of the credit as the architect of the Marvel Universe, but without his artistic collaborators there would be no Marvel as we know it. November 2nd is the birthday of one of the Man’s most important and contentious partners – Stunning Steve Ditko, co-creator of both Spider-Man and Dr. Strange. The reclusive artist let his freak flag fly on the page with the latter, sending the mystical hero into psychedelic dimensions of flowing shapes and impossible perspectives.\nDitko left Marvel in 1966 (the rumor is over an argument with Stan Lee over the identity of the Green Goblin in Spider-Man , which is the most comics thing ever) but his work still stands as some of the most inventive the medium has ever seen. This handsome hardcover omnibus edition collects his complete run on Dr. Strange as well as the Roy Thomas / Bill Everett issues that followed. Read up before you see the movie so you can tell the Wand of Watoomb from the Rod of R’Thakk.\n$67.50 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/1/2016 Grim Fandango Remastered Soundtrack\nHopefully you’re sweating out your candy hangovers on this fine November morning, but if you’re close to the border you might be preparing for another holiday. November 1st is Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead, when the living honor and remember the dead with sugar skulls, elaborate altars and satirical poems. It’s pretty damned cool.\nAnd when you talk Day of the Dead and geek culture, there’s only one game that comes to mind: Tim Schafer’s legendary Grim Fandango . The LucasArts adventure game was mindblowing when it dropped in 1998, with a unique art style that illustrated the tale of travel agent Manny Calavera in the Land of the Dead as he helps people on their journey to the Land of Eternal Rest. It’s one of the best games of its genre.\nUnfortunately, until Amazon tries to battle Steam and sell games digitally (don’t do that), you can’t buy the remastered version there. What you can get, though, is the game’s insanely good soundtrack by Peter McConnell, which blends Latin jazz up into an all-time great set of music performed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.\n$8.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/31/2016 Warlock by Jim Starlin: The Complete Collection\nIt’s Halloween, but we need to be practical here: if you order something spooky from Amazon, it’ll be November before it gets to you (even with Prime). So let’s take the day to commemorate the creation of one of the greatest villains in comic book history.\nJim Starlin was in the middle of a short run on Iron Man in 1972, taking the armored Avenger into space to contend with less mundane threats than he was used to. In issue #55, we met Thanos the mad Titan for the first time. The purple-skinned near-immortal would become one of Marvel’s most dependable villains, anchoring numerous crossovers like the original Infinity Gauntlet . His murder of James “War Machine” Rhodes in Civil War II shows he’s still a mover. Oh, and of course the Marvel Cinematic Universe is setting him up as the Big Bad (played by Josh Brolin).\nTo really get an idea of why Thanos is the pimp he is, you need to go back to the source. This hefty volume collects Starlin’s wild 70s work on Warlock , where he single-handedly explored the trippier sections of Marvel’s cosmology.\n$25.48 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/28/2016 Stargate SG-1 Complete Series Seasons 1-10 Collection\nIn terms of sheer amount of content produced, the Stargate franchise ranks up with the most successful science fiction of all time. Since the first movie hit theaters on October 28, 1994, it’s spawned two more movies, three TV shows, an animated series, a couple video games and even a pinball machine. Not too shabby, by our standards.\nThe franchise’s longevity can in many ways be chalked up to the popularity of Stargate SG-1 , the first spin-off series. Over the course of ten seasons, SG-1 built a huge mythology around the alien Go’auld, who have been trifling with human history since the dawn of time. The show was brisk, had a hefty effects budget for the time (a reported $400,000 per episode) and holds up well. Thanks to Amazon, you can take home all ten seasons in one weighty box and binge until next year.\n$117.44 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/27/2016 Petcube\nIf you’re anything like us, the hardest part of your day is leaving your pets at home to go to the office. Unless you work for a company that lets ferrets run free in the server room and dogs camp out by the water cooler, you spend eight hours a day away from your cat or your fish or your lizard, and it’s awful. Well guess what? Technology is saving the day yet again. Meet the Petcube.\nThis camera lets you interact with your pets through a special app from anywhere in the world. The self-contained unit contains a speaker and microphone so you can talk to your furry friend, observe their motions, and even boasts an aimable laser pointer that you can control with your finger through the app. The camera delivers crisp 720p video and you can take snapshots of your pet and share them.\n$143.20 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/26/2016 The ICO and Shadow of the Colossus Collection\nWhen you get gamers talking about the best console of all time, a few float to the top. The Super Nintendo is obviously up there, and some holdouts will claim the Dreamcast. But in the modern era, only one box had the range and quality, and that was the Sony PlayStation 2. Easily the dominant console of the early 21st century, the PS2 boasted a staggering software library and impressive (at the time) technical specs. On October 26, 2000, North America met the hardware for the first time, and we loved it.\nYou can (and maybe should) buy a used PS2 on Amazon for under fifty bucks, but if you want to play two of the hardware’s best games on a slightly more modern machine, pick up this collection of Fumito Ueda’s PS2 masterpieces Ico and Shadow of the Colossus , remastered for the PS3. Ueda’s third game, The Last Guardian , finally releases this December, so if you’re not familiar with his work you might want to get on that.\n$22.05 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/25/2016 Halloween Complete Collection\nIt’s that time of the year again, where ghouls and ghosts and killers and thrillers crawl from their crypts to scare us just like we want them to. But October 25th has special resonance for any true horror fan, as it’s the day that John Carpenter’s Halloween hit theaters in 1978. The film was shot on a $300,000 budget, but Carpenter wanted to make something with the same visceral impact as The Exorcist . He did it with amazing performances, razor-sharp cinematography and the creation of an iconic villain – the blank-masked Shape, Michael Myers.\nIt was a huge success and the rest is history, spawning six sequels and a reboot trilogy. And you can get them in one convenient box set for a pretty reasonable price right here. The package includes all ten movies with quality transfers, so you can sing the “Silver Shamrock” jingle in deliciously clear stereo all year.\n$49.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/24/2016 The Comic Book History Of Comics\nWe’re typically looking to the future here at Geek as much as we can, but every so often we need to turn an eye to the past. October 24th is one of the most important days in geek history, as it marks the birth of one of our most treasured art forms: the comic. On this day in 1896, the New York World printed what is considered the first ever comic strip, called “The Great Dog Show in M’Googan Avenue” by R.F. Outcault.\nThat strip introduced a bald ragamuffin in a yellow nightdress who came to be called the Yellow Kid, the first comics star. While those early Outcault strips are kind of hard to read a century later, you can learn about them and the rest of the history of comics in The Comic Book History Of Comics by long-time Marvel and Valiant writer Fred Van Lente and artist Ryan Dunlavey. This brisk collection of stories tackles the high points and low ones of the medium we love with humor and heart.\n$19.10 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/21/2016 AUT-350C Pro Gold 3G Connected Car Adapter\nAs we write this, huge chunks of the Internet are down due to a hacker attack against one of the Web’s biggest DNS servers.

Today’s product is a pretty interesting step into the world of the Internet of Things, where every object you own is in some way wired into the global information network.\nIt’s called the AUT-350C Pro Gold 3G Connected Car Adapter, and it’s designed to make the bond between you and your whip stronger than ever. Hook this puppy up to your car and it’ll give you real-time location tracking, diagnostics and more. If your Check Engine light is on, instead of shelling out big bucks for a mechanic the AUT-350C can tell you what it means. The device even links up with Amazon Echo and other smart devices.\n$129.95 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/20/2016 The Flash Season 2\nOne of the things that separates DC Comics from their marvelous competition is the idea of “legacy” heroes – new characters who take up the mantle of an older one when they retire from the superhero game. The best example of that concept is the Flash. In the Golden Age, they had silver-helmeted Jay Garrick. The Silver Age introduced Barry Allen to the role, and then shortly after he was joined by a third – Wally West.\nOn this date in 1959, Flash #110 was released, and we met young Wally, who fell victim to the same freak accident that gave Barry his powers. The character has seen numerous changes over the years, but last season of the CW’s Flash series gave us a Wally West for a new generation. He took up the mantle of Kid Flash in season 3 (currently airing), but if you missed it, pick up the last season on Blu-Ray and get up to speed. Sorry for the pun. Sorry. We’re trying to delete it.\n$34.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/19/2016 The Walking Dead Compendium 3\nWe’re just a few days out from the season 7 premiere of The Walking Dead , and the cliffhanger of exactly who met the business end of Lucille, the baseball bat wielded by new big bad Negan will presumably be resolved. One of the many cool things about the AMC show is seeing where it sticks to the comics and where it goes its own way – if you’ve been reading along, you already know who gets their head caved in, but the big question is whether it’ll be the same on-screen.\nFor our money, the absolute best way to read The Walking Dead is in the massive Compendium volumes, which collect over a thousand pages of comics in one back-breaking tome. The third collection covers the introduction of Negan and the threat that comes after. You can read ahead and spoil yourself, or dole issues out as the season goes along. It’s all the same to us.\n$34.88 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/18/2016 Nintendo Selects Remix Pack\nOn October 18th, 1985, possibly the greatest thing to ever happen to Generation X hit American stores: the Nintendo Entertainment System. Single-handedly revitalizing the world of console gaming, the NES introduced us to the genius of Shigeru Miyamoto, Gunpei Yokoi and the other masterminds of Japanese design. Although the first wave of NES games was… uneven (anybody remember Chubby Cherub ?), the console got better and better, eventually boasting some of the most important games of all time.\nAlthough Nintendo is releasing the NES Classic Edition pre-loaded with a bunch of games later this year, today’s a great time to re-visit one of the most interesting things they’ve done with their library. NES Remix took titles like Excitebike , Dr. Mario and Punch-Out and transformed them into bite-sized challenges, Wario Ware style. They’re addictive and fun. Dust off the Wii U and give this one a try while you’re waiting on NX news.\n$19.88 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/17/2016 Bullitt Do you like the Fast & Furious movies? Of course you do, because you are a true cinema fan. Those flicks represent the apotheosis of the car chase as action movie, but if you want to know how the genre got there, it’s time to look back to a movie that was released on this date in 1968: Steve McQueen’s baller San Francisco thriller Bullitt .\nMcQueen, one of the most iconic action stars of all time, stars as a police detective trying to get to the bottom of an assassination attempt on a Mafia witness. But what people really remember the flick for is the chase through the San Francisco hills, with McQueen behind the wheel of a forest green Mustang GT going after a pair of hitmen. This propulsive piece of cinematography did more than just about any other movie to make car chases popular.\nFrank P. Keller won the Oscar for best editing for that scene, and it’s definitely worth multiple viewings. If you haven’t seen it, check it out.\n$14.30 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/14/2016 Underworld: The Legacy Collection If you had told us back in 2003 that Underworld would spawn a five-film franchise – more than, say, Hellboy , we would have looked at you like you were crazy. But never underestimate the appeal of Kate Beckinsale in a skin-tight catsuit. The fifth movie in the series, Blood Wars , was scheduled to be released next week but Screen Gems just let us know they’re pushing it to early 2017.\nWhat to do until then? Why not re-acquaint yourself with the series courtesy of the very affordable “Legacy Collection” on Bu-Ray, which boasts all four films as well as five and a half hours of additional material. All four films have entertaining and enlightening commentary tracks.\n$30.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/13/2016 Jack Kirby’s Fourth World Omnibus “I am the Revelation! The Tiger-Force at the core of all things! When you cry out in your dreams — it is Darkseid that you see!” With those words – and many more like them – Jack “The King” Kirby created one of the greatest villains in comic book history. And in Superman’s Pal Jimmy Olsen #134, released on this date in 1970, we got our first tantalizing glimpse of the ruler of Apokolips.\nWhen Kirby came to DC Comics in 1970 after a long stint at Marvel, the company put him on one of their worst-selling, least consequential titles. Nobody really cared about the annoying redhead that Supes got out of scrapes. But Kirby, being Kirby, took the ball and ran with it like a maniac, laying the groundwork for what would become the Fourth World saga. This gorgeous omnibus edition collects the beginning of that run, along with lots of great meaty Darkseid dialogue.\n$55.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/12/2016 QWERKYWriter\nLet’s face it: touch screens are probably the future. But for old-school geeks like us, we’ll never get used to the feeling of tapping our fingers on our monitor to get things done. We need the tactile feedback of an old-school mechanical keyboard to make us really feel like we’re hacking away. There are a number of models on the market, but we have to give props to the QWERKYWriter, which goes really retro with a typewriter-styled chassis and keys.\nFunded on Kickstarter, the QWERKYWriter is a completely wireless mechanical keyboard, powered by a rechargeable battery. The body is cast from solid aluminum and keys are triggered with mechanical click switches. One of the coolest things is the return bar, which you can macro program to do just about any task you want. This thing is a solid piece of tech that will make writing on your iPad or other tablet significantly more pleasurable.\n$349.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/11/2016 Saturday Night Live, Season 1 41 years ago today, a little television show called Saturday Night Live made its debut. Developed by NBC to fill a hole left by the end of Johnny Carson repeats on weekends, the sketch comedy program would change the course of humor forever, launching the careers of dozens of stars from John Belushi to Kate McKinnon. The first season of SNL is a fascinating historical document, as the Not Ready for Prime Time Players find their unique voices in front of a live audience week by week.\nThis DVD collection of the whole first season is amazing to watch – George Carlin completely blows the first ever opening monologue. Richard Pryor kills it in his episode. Musical acts include Abba and Gil Scott-Heron. And the Muppets are on it making decidedly more adult jokes than they’ll ever make again.\n$14.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/10/2016 Arduino Uno Ultimate Starter Kit\nTinkering with electronics has been a hallmark of the geek experience for generations. While our ancestors would head to Radio Shack to stock up on resistors and diodes, modern geeks are engaged in some significantly cooler stuff. One of the neatest platforms that makers are using for projects is Arduino, an open-source system that links microcontrollers that can control physical objects. Those funky robots and bespoke gadgets you see on YouTube? It’s more than likely that Arduino makes them go.\nSo how do you get going with this stuff? One click, buddy. The Uno Ultimate Starter Kit has everything you need to set up an Arduino project, with a 72 page manual that contains a dozen starter ideas. Clear step-by-step diagrams make them all digestible. It comes with a breadboard, tons of wires and LEDs, a DC motor and lots of other stuff.\nThere you go. Build something cool and tell us all about it.\n$48.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/7/2016 Mafia III We’re not going to put release-day video games in this section all that often (and let’s get this out of the way right up front: ordering with Amazon Prime saves you eleven cents ), but we can’t think of a title we’re more eager to spend a weekend with than Mafia III . It’s been six years since the last game in the franchise, and developers Hangar 13 have taken it to some new and daring places.\nUnlike the last two titles, which put you in the shoes of a classic Italian mobster, the protagonist for Mafia III is Lincoln Clay, a young Black Vietnam vet in a fictionalized New Orleans-esque city. Games that tackle racial prejudice head-on are rare, and the devs have been working hard to ensure that the game pulls no punches.\nThe game also has a seriously groovy period-appropriate soundtrack with tons of great music. Although official reviews aren’t out yet, the early buzz on Twitter is very promising. We’ll be plugged into this one until Monday at least. Won’t you join us?\n$59.88 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/6/2016 Ajax Scientific 5 Piece Equal Mass Metal Density Cube\nThe best thing about Amazon – aside from the ability to get anything in the world delivered to your door like a pasha of old – is the site’s incredible array of objects with little to no practical use. Case in point: these five cubes of equal density but different size from Ajax Scientific. Unless you’re a high school science teacher (and if you are, that’s awesome), you probably don’t need cubes of aluminum, brass, copper, iron and zinc.\nBut what does “need” mean, really? All you actually need is food, water and a place to sleep. Everything else is transitory and meaningless. So why not embrace that meaninglessness with five beautiful, perfect cubes of various metals? You can make them the start of a cube collection of every substance known to man. When you get one of every element, urban legend has it you can combine them all to make a reality-warping Cosmic Cube.\n$13.65 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/5/2016 Pokemon Go Survival Knife If you’re anything like us, you’re still out on the streets for at least a little bit every day playing Pokemon Go . And your hunt for new creatures to catch and gyms to conquer might have taken you off the beaten path. It might be time to equip yourself with a little protection.\nThe Pokemon Go Survival Multi Tools Knife from Vivien Discount Store has everything you need to keep safe and secure on your travels. They offer it in three different colors – red, blue and yellow, of course – and each color is engraved with the corresponding team Valor, Instinct or Mystic logo.\nAt just four and a half inches closed, this low-profile knife fits comfortably in a pocket. The 1/3 serrated blade is durable enough to cut through rope and other obstructions, and a built-in LED light lets you illuminate your workspace.\nThe blade is notched to cut away seat belts in the event of a car crash, and it also has a glass breaker fob, bottle opener and firestarter (in case you run into any Grass-type Pokemon who take extra damage from fire). It’s quite the well-designed little multitool for the price.\nThe Valor and Mystic knives come in two different designs – the standard single-bladed model as well as a Batarang-esque “Zubat” style. The Instinct one only comes in Zubat for some reason, but nobody’s on Team Instinct anyways.\nNow we’re not saying that you should go out and have West Side Story -esque knife fights with other teams. Let’s keep our battling to the virtual plane. But a survival knife is good for lots of other things besides spilling blood. Oh, and they also throw in a free color-coded bracelet so your teammates can identify you from a distance.\n$19.95 with free shipping from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/4/2016 Westworld One of the most unexpected surprises of the fall TV season has been HBO’s Westworld , the adaptation of a Michael Crichton book about a theme park full of realistic robots. When some of them begin malfunctioning and doing things they shouldn’t be able to (like murder, for instance), drama ensues. The show has a fine pedigree – created by J.J. Abrams and Christopher Nolan’s brother Jonathan, and with an awesome cast including Anthony Hopkins and Evan Rachel Wood, it looks to be another hit.\nThe thing is, Westworld was already a movie back in 1973. A pretty damn good one, too. Crichton directed the tale, which featured Peter Martin and James Brolin as guests in the park when the robot attractions start to go ape. Yul Brynner is awesome as the Gunslinger, armed with weapons that theoretically don’t allow him to hurt humans. Of course, that theory fails and the end result is a fun, futuristic box office hit.\n$5.49 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here.\n10/3/2016 Cage Are you done binging on Luke Cage ‘s first season yet? If Netflix’s latest adventure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has whet your appetite for a little more action, why not delve into the back issues? You could certainly start from the beginning with the ’70s Power Man book, but for something a little closer to the modern take, Brian Azzarello, and Richard Corben’s five-issue Cage miniseries will hit the spot.\nAzzarello is famous for 100 Bullets and other titles, and Corben is a legendary underground artist who cut his teeth in the pages of Heavy Metal . His mainstream work is few and far between, so this is a rare treat. Published under Marvel’s Max imprint (sort of a “mature readers” line akin to Vertigo, but less fantasy-oriented and more gritty action), this book brings Luke Cage back to the streets, putting him in the middle of a gang war as he looks to solve the murder of a little girl.\nCorben’s art is gorgeous, the script hews close to the character’s Blaxploitation roots, and it’s an interesting midway point between the tiara-wearing Hero for Hire and the devoted family man and Avenger that he became. Very much worth reading, especially at this price.\n$9.95 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here.", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00VSBYH40", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1606904817", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01E1WUZOS", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1632154560", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00C7U17US", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B016O1L2AA", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01IPUGYK6", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JGWN8O8", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01EWJ1WS8", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GFJ68RI", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01DT0GO4I", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1501107720", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785188479", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01D6H0RKG", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1511927011", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007FFUMKQ", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GPQOZ1I", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GGPFHHS", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1421585642", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B016VA9F30", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00WJ32IJC", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006CQ1ZHI", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00407PNY2", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B018841F8K", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000JLQPYK", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KSQHX1K", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01LYUA6OS", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01IRRSCTI", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1606905287", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1940825911", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00MCCX0QA", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KDU8G6W", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01AWARUKU", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009YQLP7I", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01LRCDYXE", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0036EH3U2", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0064A5C6C", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01D2LTNWO", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01KM6EJOY", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006IJIC", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00L5HIJCI", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01AC3ZD5G", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000J0TF02", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007F8ZDEI", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062470221", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074401767X", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00EPQM9WM", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01JRBQ9PC", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01C42GYQA", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002I0J5FG", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B013H0IRO0", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B015WVHWKC", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00LOWJ6JY", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00RNBGJJK", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0045HCJKS", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401213448", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B011MUA592", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00EF0NY7W", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1613771975", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062378074", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00SDTU3C0", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B019E1IUDO", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785199241", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004E10QCI", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1302901613", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00BT0NDB8"], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T07:02:55.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
