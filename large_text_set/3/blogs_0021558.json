Today, the tipster is back with yet another Samsung Galaxy S8 leak. The leakster has posted more renders of the Galaxy S8, and this time the focus is on the rear. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) March 20, 2017 \nAs seen in the renders, the Samsung Galaxy S8 will feature an almost bezel-less display. The device will feature a dual-edged curved display, and its top and bottom bezels will be quite slim too. The phone’s fingerprint sensor will be located on the back panel, next to the rear camera. Unfortunately, the tipster didn’t reveal any other details of the Galaxy S8. \nMarch 29th is the confirmed launch date for the Galaxy S8. The event will kick off at 8.30 am on Wednesday, and will be live streamed on the company’s website for the world to watch.
