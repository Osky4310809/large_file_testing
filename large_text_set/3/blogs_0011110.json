A separate investigation by the Electoral Commission into whether the national party broke election spending limits is also under way and expected to come to a head within weeks. \nThe allegations, first uncovered by Channel 4 News, are that spending in marginal seats on a battlebus tour and teams of party officials was wrongly recorded as national, rather than local spending. \nThe penalties for wrongly declaring local elections are steep, with possible criminal charges for MPs, their election agents and results being declared void. \nIt is understood police could meet the Crown Prosecution Service as early as 21 March to discuss bringing a possible charge in relation to South Thanet, where Farage was narrowly beaten by Mackinley. Nigel Farage says he would stand for election again in South Thanet Read more \nFarage, the former Ukip leader, has already said he may be interested in rerunning in the Kent coastal seat if it there were to be a prosecution and byelection. \nKent police said: “The investigation into this complex matter is ongoing and officers continue to follow lines of enquiry. Therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further. \n“Officers from Kent police continue to work with the Electoral Commission as the investigation continues.” \nSeparately, a group of Conservative MPs under investigation over their election expenses are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of support from the party’s headquarters. \nOne has sent an email to Tory HQ accusing the party of keeping secret a draft of the Electoral Commission report from MPs whose local spending returns are under investigation. \nIn an email seen by Sky News, Karl McCartney, a Tory MP under investigation who is helping other MPs, accused party officials of trying to save themselves rather than help those who were elected. \nHe wrote that his colleagues “feel completely cast adrift by CCHQ/whips/the parliamentary party and left to fend for themselves”. \nHe added: “At what stage do you think you (the party) might inform us that another media s***storm is coming? We didn’t create this mess, the clever dicks at CCHQ did, and I don’t see their professional reputations being trashed in the media much.” \n“The initial cock-ups, ‘strategy’ and ineptitude with regard to this issue that has so negatively impacted our: lives, standing in our communities, standing amongst colleagues, families and our regard for particular parts of the party centrally, and were all of CCHQ’s making … need to stop. \n“We are the ones who are now (and since the beginning as individuals have been) in the media spotlight and it might have been a little more reassuring and collegiate if the powers that be in our party perhaps tried to be a little bit more supportive and less interested in covering their own backsides.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T21:09:21.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
