Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson's time on the sidelines could continue this weekend. \nMeanwhile, the club have taken their plans for a Â£50 million redevelopment of their academy to incorporate a new first-team training facility to local residents. \nA one-day consultation was held in Kirkby where members of the public were able to view the proposals and speak to representatives from the club and Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council, as well as planning and construction experts. \nPlans include the construction of a new combined training centre, the redevelopment of the existing facilities including an upgraded pitch, a new stand for spectators and designs to convert the main pitch into a first-class covered full-sized pitch. \nLiverpool need to purchase land next to the current academy site for the expansion and, as a result, new and improved pitches and changing facilities for local amateur teams as well as dog-walking and cycle paths will be created.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T19:07:54.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
