You’ve either come out on top or put yourself down a few bucks, but regardless, there’s no more time to panic about the score.\nThe Super Bowl has gone to overtime for the first time with the score tied at 28-28, but the squares game is over. If you have the square corresponding to the number 8 for the Atlanta Falcons and 8 for the New England Patriots , congratulations again, because you’re a winner! Go and collect your Super Bowl squares earnings from your friends and family, and make sure they don’t leave the party without some trash-talk from the winner.\nInevitably, there was someone at your Super Bowl party who took the game too seriously, looking up common scores and ways to gain an edge on the competition — but look who’s on top now? Have fun celebrating, but don’t rub it in too much, or then you’ll just be that jerk who took everyone’s money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:30:20.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
