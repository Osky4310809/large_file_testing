It is her second playlist in two days, following yesterday's release of her \"Pretty Girls Like Trap Music\" playlist with 2 Chainz . \nListen to \"Queens Got Da Crown\" below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:33:07.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
