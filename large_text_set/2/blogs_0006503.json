Later in the game, though, Hyundai aired a spot that highlighted those who have truly been bold in pursuit of our liberty. The ad aired late because they put it together during the game , visiting US troops that have recently been deployed in Zagan, Poland. A few of the troops were asked to go into specially prepared booths, only to find that Hyundai had arranged for them to spend some time with their families — at the Super Bowl itself.\nThis one got us choked up, getting an 8-0 sweep for best spot from the people in our party:\n\nWell done, Hyundai. Well done.\nBy the way, the Honda CR-V ad was still a lot of fun, too. It’ll have you asking, “How did they do that?” Audentes Fortuna iuvat, Darryl.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:34:58.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
