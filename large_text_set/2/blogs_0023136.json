And it’s time to celebrate, because Davis officially just won her first Academy Award for her role as Rose Maxson in the Denzel Washington-led (and directed!) drama Fences. \nBut tbh, even if she hadn’t taken home the award , she’d be a winner to us because her outfit was every fashion goal we could ever hope to achieve in either our real lives or dreams.\nJust look at this red Armani gown ‘s halter neckline and the draped detail around her shoulders. The only thing more impressive is her dazzling smile (although we wouldn’t kick that silver clutch out of bed either).\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images Somehow the dress is even more gorgeous from the side. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images And honestly, slightly unrelated, we hope someone loves us as much as Davis and her husband, fellow actor Julius Tennon, obviously love each other. Seriously, look at those smiles.\nJeff Kravitz/Getty Images Davis spoke highly of Tennon when she took home the Golden Globe for her Fences role last month, and yes, we’re still sighing wistfully.\n“Lord knows, I don’t know what I did to deserve him walking into my life 18 years ago,” she said after her win. “I just know that it worked. I just know that it’s a great friendship. I know that when I’m down he’s up and when he’s down I’m up, so we can throw each other a rope.” We love how supportive Davis’s husband is of her career, and hope they have the best time tonight. Because they SERIOUSLY have something to celebrate!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:32:50.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
