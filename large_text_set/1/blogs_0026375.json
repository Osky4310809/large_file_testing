And as a reward for all the fans who had their concert abruptly postponed, Drizzy gifted everyone with a brand new track. Watch him sing it in the concert footage below.\n\nCurrently untitled, the song will appear on Drake’s enigmatic upcoming full-length More Life . He has recently discussed in an episode of the podcast Cal Cast that the project is less of an album proper and more of a mixtape, or in his words, “a body of work that I’m creating to bridge the gap between my major releases.” Listen to him discuss it below.\n\nStay tuned for further details on More Life to emerge. In the meantime, here’s a great video of his performance of “Hotline Bling” from his new tour:\nHotline Bling in Amsterdam. #BoyMeetsWorldTour pic.twitter.com/cJRgxBprqy \n— Word On Road (@WordOnRd) January 28, 2017 \n\nIn other music news, A$AP Rocky has dropped a new track inspired by Calvin Klein’s own Raf Simons.
