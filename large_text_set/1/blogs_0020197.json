But the timing of the Dubai-based carrier’s gambit--it’s second non-stop route between Europe and North America--has ruffled American feathers, Business Insider reports .\nPartnership for Open and Fair Skies, an organization that speaks on behalf of American, Delta , and United Airlines--collectively termed the US3--was quick to lambast what it perceived as an incursion.\n“By flagrantly violating its Open Skies agreement with the United States at the start of the Trump administration, Emirates is throwing down the gauntlet,”chief spokesperson for the group Jill Zuckman said in a statement.\nZuckman added: “we look forward to working with President Trump and his team to enforce these agreements and protect American jobs - something that the Obama administration failed to do.”\nFor more on American Airlines , watch Fortune’s video: \n\nThe uproar over Emirates’ new U.S. to Europe route--which follows flights between Milan and New York City’s JFK International Airport, launched in 2013--is part of a long-running beef between the US3 and ME3, its Middle Eastern counterpart.\nThe former alleges that the booming of Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways has come off the back of over $50 billion worth of unfair government subsidies. Their continuing creep into the U.S. market, US3 suggests, will cause domestic aviation job losses and therefore violates the Open Skies bilateral agreement, which sets the rules for air travel between the U.S and other countries.\nEmirates did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T09:09:36.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
