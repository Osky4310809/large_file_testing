The culprit has been identified as Key Jonta Foster, who also goes by the rap alias Majesty Da Rebel. This is the man who attacked me last night during a live broadcast. If anyone has seen him around please give the 7th precinct a call. pic.twitter.com/enkqQe0mxC \n— CeFaan Kim (@CeFaanKim) March 4, 2017 \nSpeaking with The New York Post , Foster says he only pulled the stunt for publicity and hoped to do so without things turning violent. \n“The reason I did it was because I knew I’d get negative feedback from it,” said Foster. “I can always flip that. I saw an opportunity and took the opportunity to promote my video and mixtape. From the beginning, it was friendly — I put my arm around him, and then he pushed me, grabbed me.” \nThe stunt was in promotion for his video “Jason,” which so far has only earned a little over 3,000 YouTube views with eight likes and 167 dislikes. That hasn’t stopped Foster from bragging about the moment on his Instagram account. A post shared by Majestydarebel (@majestydarebel) on Mar 4, 2017 at 5:13pm PST \nAccording to the article, authorities are looking to speak with Foster as Kim filed a police report. In Foster’s opinion, the story became viral because of race. \n“They’ll probably interrogate me, ask me what happened,” he said. “White guys bomb video reporters all the time. A black man tries to get air time and then gets beat up by the reporter. I’m gonna do what I gotta do and seize an opportunity.” \nWatch the video for Majesty Da Rebel’s “Jason” below.
