By Tom Phillips Published 13/01/2017 \nNintendo has officially confirmed Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which will launch on 28th April priced £49.99 in the UK. \nThere's no word of an upgrade programme for fans who own the game already on Wii U. \nThis new Deluxe edition will include MK8's existing DLC plus a sprinkling of new courses and characters. The series' classic-style Battle Mode also returns, and eight-player wireless local play is now available. \nNew characters include: Inkling Boy and Inkling Girl from Splatoon, King Boo, Dry Bones, and Bowser Jr. \nSorry, Birdo fans. \nExtra courses for Battle Mode include the Splatoon-themed Urchin Underpass and Battle Stadium, plus the GameCube's Luigi's Mansion track and Mario Kart SNES' Battle Course 1. \nAs evidenced in previous footage, players can now carry two items at a time. There's a couple of returning items - the item-stealing Boo, and the Feather to help you jump higher in Battle mode. \nIt'll run in \"up to 1080p\" on TV, which likely means lower resolution for multiplayer with more than two players, as was the case on Wii U. \nFinally, there's a new Smart Steering feature for beginners to make driving easier.
