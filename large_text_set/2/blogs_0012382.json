On Instagram today, Sarah Michelle Gellar shared a Buffy -themed valentine and it’s winning our (undead) hearts.\nThe Buffy the Vampire Slayer star — who has been in the most #goals-worthy relationship with fellow ’90s heartthrob Freddie Prinze Jr. for well over a decade — posted the valentine to her IG with the simple caption: “I <3 a good valentines card.” In the image? A pic of SMG as Buffy with the words “You’re my chosen one” emblazoned across it.\nGet it? Because Buffy was “the chosen one,” sent to Earth to slay vampires? Talk about PERFECTION! I ❤ a good #valentines card #happyvalentinesday \nA post shared by Sarah Michelle (@sarahmgellar) on Feb 14, 2017 at 7:27am PST \nBRB, sending this to all of our galentines.\nGellar followed up her “chosen one” valentine with a slightly ~saucier~ snap, this one of herself — in the nude! — holding up a big red heart reading “ValentineSlay.” (That could also read “Valentine’s Lay” buuut…you didn’t hear that from us.)\nAn oldie but a goodie #ValentineSlayDay \nA post shared by Sarah Michelle (@sarahmgellar) on Feb 14, 2017 at 11:16am PST \nFreddie, you’re a lucky gent.\n\nWe don’t know know exactly what’s on the Gellar-Prinze Valentine’s Day agenda, but judging by their boundless and endless love for each other, it’ll be romantic AF. Seriously, these two are crazy about each other, and why shouldn’t they be?\nTheir 2002 wedding was full of sweetness. A post shared by Sarah Michelle (@sarahmgellar) on Sep 24, 2016 at 3:41pm PDT \nThey seem just as happy now as they did more than a decade ago. #throwbackthursday and #thanksgiving all in one. This was our first Thanksgiving, and while we had a lot to be grateful for on that day, it doesn't compare to all that we have now. I try very hard to be grateful and appreciative all year, but it doesn't hurt to have one dedicated day. #grateful #happythanksgiving \nA post shared by Sarah Michelle (@sarahmgellar) on Nov 24, 2016 at 8:11am PST \nAnd they clearly know how to have fun (just read the caption!). Finally out like the adults we are...to see #fantasticalbeastsandwheretofindthem \nA post shared by Sarah Michelle (@sarahmgellar) on Nov 30, 2016 at 8:49pm PST \nSo cheers to great love — and slayage — on Valentine’s Day. And may we all find the Freddie or Sarah of our dreams!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:16:49.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
