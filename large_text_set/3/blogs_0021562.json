The wound was in terrible condition and infested with maggots. The poor animal was too sick and weak to get out of the sewage water where she had fallen. It was a death sentence – or rather would have been, had the rescuers not arrived in time. As they estimate, even just another hour or two without help would have ended fatally for the animal. \nFortunately, that was not what happened. The dog, who was given the name Shanti, was transported to the shelter where she received intensive treatment. She was immediately started on IV fluids the next day and her wound was cleaned and treated. The treatment continued over the next six weeks – and once in that timeframe, an amazing transformation took place. \nThanks to the dedicated team of vets and caretakers, Shanti now looks like an entirely different dog! Seeing this starved, severely wounded dog on the brink of death turn into a happy , beautiful animal is sure to bring tears to our eyes. \nClick here to visit the Animal Aid Unlimited’s website and see how you can support their life-saving work.
