Amazon has never disclosed the number of its Prime members. \nNowak came up with the number based on the assumption that 90% of Amazon's retail subscription revenue came from Prime members, and by putting an average price tag of $88 per user for each subscription (Prime costs $99 a year in the US, but is cheaper in other countries like Japan and the UK). \nMorgan Stanley \n\nPrime is one of the most important parts of Amazon's business because Prime members tend to spend more on Amazon's online shopping platform. A recent survey by Morgan Stanley estimated that about 40% of Amazon Prime members spend over $1,000 a year on Amazon, while only 8% of non-Prime shoppers do so. It also found that Amazon Prime members spend about 4.6-times more money on Amazon than non-Prime members. \nMorgan Stanley \n\nSEE ALSO: Amazon's $10 bras are a shot at Walmart and Target â€” not Victoria's Secret NOW WATCH: Science says parents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common   Amazon Jeff Bezos Prime", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:26:32.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
