Photo by Arif Jawad. On one night — November 5, 2016 — iPhone photographers canvassed the globe, from Arctic ice caves and Indonesian volcanoes, to the clubs of Johannesburg and rooftops of Shanghai. For the latest \"Shot on iPhone\" campaign, Apple enlisted a group of photographers to capture life from dusk to dawn using the low-light camera on iPhone 7. The people, sights and scenes they encountered over the course of the night resulted in a spectacular display of nighttime photography, which will be displayed in 25 countries beginning today. Apple enlisted a group of photographers to capture life from dusk to dawn using the low-light camera on iPhone 7. Some of the photographers tackled extreme climates in search of the perfect shot. Chicago-based photographer Reuben Wu ventured to Java, Indonesia to photograph the 130 active volcanoes, using an iPhone 7 attached to a drone to capture breathtaking views of Gunung Karang’s lava flow after dark. Ruairidh McGlynn traveled to Iceland to photograph the foreboding terrain of the Arctic, traveling overnight by dog sled. iPhone 7 features optical image stabilization, an f/1.8 aperture and a six-element lens. Photo by Mathieu Beth Tan. \"Iceland is well known for its iconic landscapes,\" said McGlynn. \"I wanted to produce a series of unexpected images that both pushed the boundaries of mobile photography and allowed people to reimagine Iceland — especially its possibilities at night. iPhone provides the ability to capture, process, curate and publish all on one device, all qualities that lend themselves well to the candid landscape shots and conditions I enjoy capturing.\" Ruairidh McGlynn traveled by dogsled through Iceland, stopping for a break in this ice cave. Others focused closer to home. Elsa Bleda captured artists in and around Johannesburg, South Africa. Jennifer Bin shot her hometown of Shanghai from rooftops throughout the city and Illinois’ Kristin Kelley captured the night through the eyes of her children. previous \nPhotographer Elsa Bleda captured the energy, color and life of Johannesburg, South Africa. \nReuben Wu traveled from Chicago to the volcanos of Indonesia. \nEason Hsiung focused on the late night culture of Taipei.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T05:01:28.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
