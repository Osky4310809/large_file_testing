Saxena, has reportedly agreed to halt work on the hydroelectric project's design. \nHowever, Indian sources have been quoted as saying that the Pak media claims were factually incorrect and wrong as Indian never agreed to halt the project. \nPak media also claimed that India had also agreed to review the design for the Lower Kalnai hydroelectric project. \nThe Indo-Pak Indus Water Commission conference, which began in Islamabad on Monday, saw discussions on Miyar, Lower Kalnai and Pakal Dul projects among other problems related to Indus Basin. \nThe meeting was the 113th session of the Permanent Indus Waters Commission established in 1960. The last meeting of the commission was held in 2015. \nThe meeting planned in September 2016 was cancelled due to the tension following the Uri terror attack.   23:53 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:46:37.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
