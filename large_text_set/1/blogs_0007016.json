A white, mustached man is standing and speaking to the other passengers: “These smug pilots have lost touch with regular passengers like us. Who thinks I should fly the plane?” \nMany hands are raised. \nSee, that’s The New Yorker ’s sly way of slamming conservatives for calling in check an all-too-powerful federal government back in November. But in its efforts to paint those of us who ascribe to small government principles as elitists, the magazine uncovered itself as such. \nAnd like Instapundit also noted, “Our credentialed-but-not-educated elites have crashed the plane plenty of times. They always walk away unscathed afterward. The folks back in Economy Class, not so much.” \nIt’s these smug liberals who are the ones clinging to bitterness because the folks in Economy Class have spoken. At the same time, it’s this liberal elitist attitude that gave rise to their own nemesis in Donald Trump, as the Federalist co-founder Sean Davis said: Do you want more Trump? Because this is how you get more Trump. https://t.co/zrV9ou1XHN \n— Sean Davis (@seanmdav) January 2, 2017 \nClick CONTINUE for some other great reactions to this ridiculous cartoon:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T08:21:29.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
