BMW, long the darling of driving enthusiasts, is preparing for a future in which driving duties will be handed off to the vehicle. The company plans to offer its first such car in 2021, when it releases the all-electric iNext , giving drivers the option to give up control of all steering, accelerating, and braking functions in certain driving situations. \nThe German brand showcased its in-house-developed automated-driving technology, dubbed Personal CoPilot, in a handful of 2017 BMW 530i prototype vehicles at the 2017 CES technology show. “Prototype,” though, is a loose term; short of some tacky exterior graphics, a handful of exposed electronics confined within the cargo hold, and a blue sticker covering the steering-wheel-mounted lane-keeping-assist button (BMW’s way of denoting that the button now activates Personal CoPilot), the 5-series cars brought to CES were all factory-fresh vehicles sporting the build quality and interior materials expected of a vehicle with a base price of $52,195. \nHaving previously driven the 335-hp six-cylinder 540i , CES marked our first time getting behind the wheel of the base 248-hp four-cylinder 530i. With Personal CoPilot disengaged, we drove through the city streets of Las Vegas toward Interstate 15. While our drive was too short to draw any real opinions the turbocharged four-pot, we did find it to be generally lag-free and punchy enough to get us through the slog of traffic around Las Vegas. \nDon’t Call It Autopilot \nWith a BMW 7-series , piloted by a company representative, leading us, we merged onto the freeway and engaged the Personal CoPilot system, entering what BMW calls Passenger mode. Best compared to Tesla’s Autopilot automated-driving system, Passenger mode turns over basic acceleration, braking, and steering control to the vehicle. At this point in the Personal CoPilot’s development, the system was only able to keep the car centered in the lane it occupied and follow slight curves in the road. However, by the time the iNext reaches production, BMW said the technology will be able to complete additional dynamic driving tasks such as lane changes without any driver intervention. \nWhile we weren’t able to experience Personal CoPilot in a non-tandem scenario (without a car ahead of us), the system did react with appropriate vigor when a Nissan Sentra decided to cut in between our automated 530i and the 7-series ahead of us, emitting an annoying warning chime and then applying the brakes to avoid a potential accident and create additional space between itself and the intruding Sentra. \nTips and Tricks \nIn addition to its automated-driving function, Personal CoPilot also has the ability to sense if a video is being cued up on a mobile device. After entering Passenger mode, we were instructed to play a video on a tablet. When we pushed “play” on the tablet’s screen, the car automatically closed the rear sunshades and the sunroof cover and dimmed the car’s ambient interior lighting—properly setting the mood for a video-viewing experience. Additionally, the car’s GPS was able to pull up local points of interest onto the iDrive display screen and read out pertinent information related to these places.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:50:58.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
