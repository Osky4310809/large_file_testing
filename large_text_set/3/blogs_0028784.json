(POOL/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, March 27, 2017, 6:07 PM \nThe wife of a former Chicago police officer charged with fatally shooting a black teen in 2014 said she was told not to attend training for a new job at Cook County jail over safety concerns. \nTiffany Van Dyke, 36, told the Chicago Tribune she was supposed to start the four-month training for a correction-officer job last week. Her husband, Jason Van Dyke, who is white, was charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. \n“All I want to do is support my family financially,” Tiffany Van Dyke said in a statement obtained by WLS-TV . “Right now, we are really struggling and this job would have been a big help.” \nThe mother of two told the Tribune she quit her last two jobs as a full-time fitness instructor and part-time bartender in anticipation of the new position. She had even bought costly uniforms and equipment in preparation and underwent several tests and interviews for the job. Laquan McDonald, 17, was shot 16 times by Chicago police officer Jason van Dyke in October 2014. (Family Handout) \n“To have it taken away without explanation is very disappointing,” she said in the statement. \nA top aide to Cook County Sherriff Tom Dart told the newspaper that Tiffany Van Dyke wasn’t fired and that her start date was delayed because of safety concerns she would face on the job due to her husband’s high-profile case. \nAttorney Daniel Herbert, who is representing Jason Van Dyke, called the sheriff’s office’s decision political. The department denies that allegation. Dash-cam video showed Laquan McDonald, right, walking down the street moments before being fatally shot in 2014. (AP) \n“If someone is being terminated because of who they are married to, that's a violation of their constitutional rights,\" Herbert told the Tribune. \nJason Van Dyke last week received a new indictment , adding 16 counts of aggravated battery – one charge for each of the 16 shots he fired at McDonald – on top of his murder charge.
