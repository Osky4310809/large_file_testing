Fox Rejected the Full Ad Because of It Could Be Considered ‘Politically Sensitive,’ the Ad Agency Said (84 Lumber)\nMichael Brunner, the CEO of the ad agency that created the commercial, told CBS Pittsburgh that they were forced to change the ad because of Fox.\n“Simply put, that was a spot that they didn’t think they would be willing to run during the Super Bowl.” Brunner later added on, “There’s some elements in it that are… can be considered politically sensitive… They are the host. We’re paying the dollars, but they are the host.” \nBrunner says he created the commercial with three goals in mind: to generate awareness for 84 Lumber, to create pride in the workforce, and to fill jobs within the company. \n“Ignoring the border wall and the conversation around immigration that’s taking place in the media and at every kitchen table in America just didn’t seem right,” said Rob Shapiro, the chief client officer at Brunner, the agency that worked with 84 Lumber to come up with the ad, told the Washington Post. “If everyone else is trying to avoid controversy, isn’t that the time when brands should take a stand for what they believe in?”\nThe Super Bowl ad was the first for 84 Lumber.\n“I still can’t even understand why it was censored,” Maggie Hardy Magerko, 84 Lumber’s president and owner, told the New York Times . “In fact, I’m flabbergasted by that in today’s day and age. It’s not pornographic, it’s not immoral, it’s not racist.”\nWATCH: 84 Lumber Super Bowl Commercial 2017 [EXTENDED VIDEO] 84 Lumber Super Bowl Commercial 2017: Watch 83 Lumber's full-length commercial ad here. \nClick here to read more 2. 84 Lumber Was Founded by Joe Hardy in Pennsylvania in 1956 & His Daughter, Maggie, Is Now Its CEO Joe Hardy with his daughter, Maggie Hardy.
