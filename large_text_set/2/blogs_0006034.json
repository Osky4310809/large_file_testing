I'm just gonna leave it at that.\" \nTom Brady, Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft have a personal friendship with Donald Trump, but that has not been a deterring factor in other Patriots players taking a political stand . Martellus Bennett, Devin McCourty, and Chris Long have all said publicly that they won't celebrate the Patriots' Super Bowl title at the White House.
