Zamonski (sophomore-environmental resource management) said she loved seeing the all the hard work pay off for the teams performing. \n“They put so much effort into it,” Zamonski said. \nRichlande Louineus and her friends were taking a break while eating food in the concourse, but the Pep Rally helped their motivation. \nLouineus’ favorite part was when the men’s basketball team did a throwback to the Mannequin Challenge, a trend that swept the nation last semester. The use of “Breakin’ Free” from High School Musical and music from The Lizzy McGuire Movie were surprising additions. \nThe football team’s performance was the undisputed favorite of Anusha Chauhry and Meghan Swonton, both of Alpha Omnicron Pi sorority. \n“I really liked the Disney theme,” Chaudhry (senior-security risk analysis) said. Although she felt a little sad that this is her last THON, the Pep Rally raised her spirits. +1 Buy Now Max Petrosky \nMeanwhile, Nicole Homanick got excited for the last day of THON by the men’s gymnastics team’s performance. \n“I really liked that they didn’t just make a dance routine,” Homanick (freshman-business) said, referring to the technical side of the performance. “The moves they did because of their gymnastic skill blew me away.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:42:15.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
