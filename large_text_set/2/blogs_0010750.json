Gen. Keith Kellogg as the acting national security adviser and a senior administration official said he was one of three candidates the president was considering to replace Flynn on a permanent basis.\nWhoever emerges as Trump’s choice will take the helm of the National Security Council at a time when the young administration is grappling with a series of national security challenges, including North Korea’s reported ballistic missile launch. The president, who was joined at his Mar-a-Lago estate by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend, voiced solidarity with Japan.\nThe White House is also dealing with fallout from the rocky rollout of Trump’s immigration executive order, which has been blocked by the courts. The order was intended to suspend the nation’s refugee program and bar citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\nHere’s a look at the top named contenders for the post, which does not require Senate confirmation:\nRETIERD LT. GEN. KEITH KELLOGG Kellogg had previously been appointed the National Security Council chief of staff and, along with Flynn, advised Trump on national security and foreign policy issues during the campaign. He had been considered for national security adviser before the post went to Flynn.\nKellogg was chief operating officer of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, the interim governing body following the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. He previously worked as executive vice president of research and technology for Virginia-based information technology firm CACI International, which works as a contractor for defense, intelligence and homeland security agencies.\nDAVID PETREAUS The most audacious choice would likely be former CIA director David Petreaus. Petraeus, a retired four star general, was bounced from his position atop the intelligence agency in 2012 after he it was revealed that he passed on classified information to his biographer, who had also become his mistress.\nBut Trump during the campaign spoke sympathetically about Petreaus’ plight despite his frequent criticisms of his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified materials. Petreaus was briefly under consideration to become secretary of State before Trump picked Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson.\nRETIRED VICE ADMIRAL ROBERT HARWARD Robert Harward, a Navy Seal, served as Deputy Commander of the United States Central Command when it was under the command of General James Mattis, who is now secretary of Defense. He served on the National Security Council for President George W. Bush and commissioned the National Counter Terrorism Center.\nUpon retirement in 2013 after a nearly 40-year career in the Navy, Harward took a post as a chief executive officer for defense and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin in the United Arab Emirates. Trump has recently been in very public negotiations with Lockheed over the cost of its F-35 fighter jet program.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:12:45.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
