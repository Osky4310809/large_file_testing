The 27-year-old, India's stand-in skipper for the day, slammed a run-a-ball unbeaten 41 to help her side pip South Africa by one wicket in a record chase and clinch the ICC Women's World Cup Qualifier title in a tense last-ball finish on Tuesday (February 21). \nSet to chase a daunting target of 245 in the sapping heat of Colombo, another sluggish start meant India were left to play catch up for a better part of their innings. But cameos from the top order kept them going until a mini collapse caused panic. And when it seemed all over, Harmanpreet hung around with the tail, held her nerve, took a gamble and then slammed a massive six off the penultimate delivery to turn the game on its head and record India's highest-ever heist in the 50-over format. \nThe ploy to go in with a spin-heavy attack that could exploit South Africa's weakness didn't provide requisite results as Dane van Niekerk & Co. posted 244 before folding with two deliveries left in the final over. India were already without their regular skipper Mithali Raj, who sustained a hamstring niggle in their final Super Sixes clash against Pakistan on Sunday. That they lost opener MD Thirushkamini in the eighth over of the chase further added to India's woes. But the 124-run partnership for the second wicket between the in-form duo of Mona Meshram (59) and Deepti Sharma (71) put India back on the track. \nThe duo welcomed Ayabonga Khaka into the attack with a 10-run over that took India to 32 for 1 at the end of mandatory powerplay to restore the chase. They tread with utmost caution, only punishing the loose ones on offer. The team hundred came up only in the 25th over, after which Meshram stepped out to Sune Luus and lofted her over extra cover for her first six of the game and third half-century of the tournament. \nDeepti was dropped on 46 in the following over and the left-hander made South Africa pay for the mistake by adding another 29 to India's chase. She slammed four quick boundaries, raising her third half-century of the tournament with the first one, before being dropped once again on 70. Her luck eventually ran out as Laura Wolvaardt held on to a smart catch that spelled the end of the 124-run stand. Meshram too fell in the following over, leaving India at 148 for 3. \nHarmanpreet and Veda Krishnamurthy added 38 for the brief but entertaining fourth-wicket stand but that tells you only half the story. The Indian captain played a mere spectator and Veda did the bulk of scoring, hitting 31 off 27 to cut down the required rate. With 59 required off the final ten overs, Veda edged one behind to the keeper to hand Marizanne Kapp her second success. \nShikha Pandey hit a couple of boundaries during her brief stay to keep up with the asking rate before being run out at a crucial juncture. Devika Vaidya and wicketkepeer-bat Sushma Verma bagged golden ducks as India slipped to 211 for 7. But Harmanpreet, at the other end, kept finding the odd boundary to take India closer. \nWith 12 required off 12, a single off the first ball of the penultimate over meant tailender Poonam Yadav was left to negotiate Kapp's pace as well as find the runs. Poonam ran with all her might, off the final ball, for a couple to pass on the strike to Harmanpreet. With the equation down to nine required off the final over, and two wickets in hand, the skipper took a massive gamble - calling Poonam for a non-existent second - in her attempt to regain strike. \nThe three dots that followed Poonam's run-out might have taken South Africa to the brink of a thrilling win but in a stunning anti-climax, Harmanpreet stepped out to Letsoalo and deposited the slower delivery over the deep midwicket ropes to set up a thrilling finish. With two required off the final delivery, Harmanpreet again charged down the track and lofted the full toss towards long-on to script India's best ever ODI chase, with only a wicket to spare. \nEarlier in the day, van Niekerk opted to bat and openers Lizelle Lee (37) and Wolvaardt (21) vindicated the decision by putting up 51 in the mandatory powerplay before being separated by Pandey. Lee spared no bowler as she gave her side a flying start with three boundaries and as many sixes in her 30-ball cameo. Wolvaardt fell soon after as Poonam held on to a low return catch in her follow through. \nTrisha Chetty looked in good touch and contributed 22 off 25 to the team's total before being run out. Former skipper Mignon du Preez combined Chloe Tryon (23) for a 34-run fourth-wicket partnership that took the team past the 100-run mark. But it was van Niekerk who upped the ante with her 42-ball knock worth 37 runs that put South Africa on course for a total in the vicinity of 250 that they always seemed to be heading towards after the breezy start. She hit four boundaries and a six before Pandey had the captain caught at midwicket by her Indian counterpart. \nDu Preez fell in the next over, when South Africa had added only one more to their total, leaving the tail to take them to a challenging total. Luus, who had hit an unbeaten fifty after being promoted to one-down in their Super Sixes encounter against Sri Lanka, bore the responsibility yet again and chipped in with a quick 35 to propel her side to 244 that eventually proved a touch less. \nBrief scores: South Africa 244 in 49.4 overs (Mignon du Preez 40, Lizelle Lee 37, Dane van Niekerk 37; Rajeshwari Gayakwad 3-51, Shikha Pandey 2-41) lost to India 245/9 in 50 overs (Deepti Sharma 71, Mona Meshram 59, Hamranpreet Kaur 41*; Marizanne Kapp 2-36, Ayabonga Khaka 2-55) by 1 wicket. © Cricbuzz TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:26:05.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
