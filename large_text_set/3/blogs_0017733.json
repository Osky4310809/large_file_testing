The newest iteration of Go Nagai’s violent demonic classic has finally been given a video preview that you can check out at the end of this article, and it looks like it’s going to be awesome, even if the subtitle Crybaby doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense.\nThe upcoming Devilman: Crybaby was just announced via Netflix, and it will include iconic Japanese anime director and writer Masaaki Yuasa, who’s taking charge of the project at large. With the release of the first trailer, it’s clear the show isn’t going to take too many liberties with what made the original series so iconic in the first place. Even though Yuasa is typically known for a lot lighter fare, it’ll be interesting to see what he can come up with in terms of the newest Devilman.\nFor the unfamiliar, Devilman was an anime and manga series that aired on Japanese TV back in 1972, and it followed teenager Akira Fudo on a long and sordid journey through the world of demons. It was for quite some time considered one of the most violent manga and anime series at the time back then and has since inspired ridiculously popular shows like Berserk, an enormous favorite of mine. Its fanbase has only grown through the years as new readers and viewers pick it up and further get into the story. The new series will undoubtedly pick up steam and cement a new fanbase now as well.\nDevilman: Crybaby is going to release in Japan in 2018, so we may be waiting a while for it to hit American shores, or it could release simultaneously since it’s going to be from Netflix. One thing’s for sure: It’s going to be an awesome revitalization of a classic show.\n  Devilman for President Button \nBuy Me Now \n2. Devilman Japanese Tee \nBuy Me Now \n3.
