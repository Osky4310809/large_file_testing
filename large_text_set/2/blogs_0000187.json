You were wrong , says Pat Robertson . Sure, he doesn’t understand the topic, but he knows it can’t be true. \n… Robertson blasted climate scientists as a group of closed-minded religious fundamentalists: “This thing has become like a religion, if you don’t believe in climate change, then you have violated the tenets of the religion and you need to be excommunicated , it’s just unbelievable.” \nRobertson called the science “unsettled,” claiming that any number of factors could be causing climate change and wondering if “the earth is actually getting a little cooler now than hotter.” \nSpoiler: It’s not getting cooler . \nJust to state the obvious, science isn’t a religion. It requires evidence. It’s self-correcting. It moves in the direction of greater understanding. It’s not whatever the hell you want it to be. \nNo wondering Robertson doesn’t get it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:06:05.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
