Any speech in January given by a leader who is behind in the polls tends to be described as a “relaunch”, but in this case there is a deliberate attempt to recalibrate the way he presents himself, best explained in this Politico Europe article. Essentially Corbyn plans to stir things up a bit more, stressing his credentials as an anti-establishment insurgent. \nNewspapers love relaunch stories because they always pave the way for the follow-up, “Relaunch flops”, and Corbyn’s week hasn’t been universally acclaimed as a success. In some accounts he has been strongly criticised for muddling his message on free movement and maximum pay caps. But other assessments, like this one and this one, have been more positive. At least the media have been talking about Labour and its policies to curb excessive way. \nAnd relaunch week isn’t even over. Corbyn is giving a keynote speech to the Fabian Society conference this morning and it will include an eye-catching policy announcement - a commitment to take care homes into public ownership if they are risk of going bust. Labour released some details overnight, and here is the Guardian’s preview story. Jeremy Corbyn vows to take failed care homes into public ownership Read more \nBut the speech doesn’t just cover social care. Other extracts released overnight make it clear that Corbyn is going to launch a sweeping attack on the economic system works, promising a “complete break with this rigged system”. \nLast year’s global political earthquake didn’t just come out of the blue. \nThere are many of us who had felt the tremors growing for years. \nThe people who run Britain have been taking our country for a ride. \nThey’ve stitched up our political system to protect the powerful. \nThey’ve put the country at risk by taking us into disastrous foreign wars. \nThey’ve rigged the economy and business rules to line the pockets of their friends. \nThey’ve slashed taxes on the richest - £70bn from now till 2022 - and cut pay and vital services for the rest. \nThey’ve sold off our country’s assets and handed over public services to be milked by tax dodgers. \nThey’ve piled up debt while failing to invest in the jobs and industries of the future. \nThe truth is the system simply doesn’t work for the vast majority of people. \nLabour under my leadership stands for a complete break with this rigged system. \nThe point about this is that it is as much an attack on New Labour as it is on the Conservatives. \nHere is the timetable for the morning. \n10am: Kate Green, the Labour MP and Fabian Society chair, and Andrew Harrop, the Fabian Society general secretary, open the conference. \n10.10am: Jeremy Corbyn delivers his speech. \n11am: Plenary session entitled “Future Left: Is Progressive politics dead?”, with Labour MP Stella Creasy, Jonathan Bartley, the Green party co-leader, Owen Jones, the Guardian columnist, Claire Fox, director of the Institute of Ideas and Andrew Harrop. \n12.15pm: Five breakout sessions, on various topics, with contributors including Jonathan Ashworth, Kate Green, Maria Eagle, Rushanara Ali, Dawn Butler, Margaret Hodge and Bridget Phillipson. \nThe conference does run into the afternoon, but I will probably be wrapping up around 2pm. \nI’m just on my way to the conference now. I will post again after 9.30am. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time.
