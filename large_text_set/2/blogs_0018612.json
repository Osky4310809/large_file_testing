But it was like wearing a fancy dress over a severed artery and figuring no would notice the bleeding. \nThe threats against Jews began just before Donald Trump's inauguration. And since that time, there have been nearly 70 bomb threats against 54 Jewish community centers in 27 states. This week, up to 200 headstones at Missouri's historic Chesed Shel Emeth Society Jewish cemetery were knocked over and desecrated. \nDid you think that the election of Trump, a President endorsed by the chair of the American Nazi party — not to mention various neo-Nazi groups, white supremacist groups, the official KKK newspaper and militia groups — was going to usher in a wave of inclusiveness that would include Jews? President Trump was visiting the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture with Ivanka and Ben “Uncle Tom” Carson when he finally addressed the issue.

The threats against Jews began just before Donald Trump's inauguration. And since that time, there have been nearly 70 bomb threats against 54 Jewish community centers in 27 states. (Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) \nDid you vote for him wrongly believing that anti-Semites would leave the Jews alone because, hey, don't all Jews hate all Muslims? Isn't the enemy of my enemy my friend? \nThe Jewish newspaper, The Forward has called Donald Trump's \"silence about the recent spate of anti-Semitism\"\"deeply disturbing.\" And rightfully so. \nSo finally, on Tuesday, after nearly ignoring the issue, President Trump was visiting the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture with Ivanka and Ben “Uncle Tom” Carson when he finally addressed the issue. \n\"The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community at community centers are horrible, and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” the President said.

And besides, why let the black people have the entire spotlight? \nIn the meantime, last week President Trump called a question by a reporter (who happened to be an orthodox Jew) \"insulting\" when he was asked if he'd condemn the wave of anti-Semitic violence sweeping the country. \n\"I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life.\" Steven Goldstein of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, called Trump’s statement “a Band-Aid on the cancer of anti-Semitism.\" (Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images) \nNo, actually, I've seen a lot of people who are even less anti-Semitic than the neo-Nazi-endorsed President of the United States. Those people would include everyone in my family, all my friends, most of the people I work with and yes, me. \nTrump's failure to condemn anti-Semitism can no longer be ignored \nTrump saying \"it must stop,\" is the equivalent of a parent saying \"Stop hitting your sister\" to the bully older brother without doing anything about the violence in their home. Remember, this is the President who forgot to mention \"Jews,\"\"Jewish\" or even \"anti-Semitism\" in his presidential proclamation on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. \nShockingly, leaders of some Jewish groups were happy that the President even brought up the subject of anti-Semitism at all, praising him for his one sentence on the subject at the museum. Trump saying \"it must stop,\" is the equivalent of a parent saying \"Stop hitting your sister\" to the bully older brother without doing anything about the violence in their home. (SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) \nNot Steven Goldstein of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, who called it “a Band-Aid on the cancer of anti-Semitism.\" \nIt can't happen here? Right. First it was the Mexicans and the Muslims, and now it's the Jews. \nAndy Cohen slams anti-Semitism after Jewish cemetery is damaged \nNever forget the famous words spoken by Pastor Martin Neimoller in 1948: “Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.\" \nWell, no one will be left except the lying press, that is.
