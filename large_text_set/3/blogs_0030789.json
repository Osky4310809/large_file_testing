In addition to the rising adoption of electronic banking channels in many of the African markets, where UBA operates, the Bank leveraged its strong franchise and geographical footprint. \nAs reflected in the results released on March 24, 2017 at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), covering the period January to December 2016, the Group saw a significant 32 percent growth in profit before tax to N91 billion, compared to N68 billion profit recorded over the same period in 2015. UBA’s profit after tax grew by 22 percent to N72 billion, from N60 billion recorded the previous year. \nCommenting on the results, Kennedy Uzoka, the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer expressed satisfaction at the resilience of the bank, despite the macroeconomic challenges in a number of countries where UBA operates. \nThe performance was buoyed by considerable growth in both interest and non-interest income, as well as increasing efficiency gains from cost management initiatives. UBA’s subsidiaries outside of Nigeria are increasingly gaining market share, reinforcing the strong and impressive subsidiary contribution to the Group, estimated at one-third of profit in 2016, from a quarter in 2015 financial year.
