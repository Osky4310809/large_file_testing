They'll take two very important away goals back to Turin, but here are six takeaways from the match. This content is subject to copyright. AFP/Getty Images 1 Alex Telles' red card changed the game \nJuventus were dominant before Telles was idiotically sent off with a second yellow card in the 27th minute, but they couldn't turn their possession and chances into end product. After his sending off though, Porto were dragged side to side by Juventus' combinations and constant switches in play, and eventually they just couldn't maintain their staunch defense. They might've had a chance with Telles on the pitch, but without him they were doomed. Add that to the fact that they had to remove their best attacker, Andre Silva, to shore up the formation and it gets even worse for Telles. This content is subject to copyright. AFP/Getty Images 2 Max Allegri's gambles paid off \nAllegri's not only made the bold move to change Juventus' system to an ultra-attacking 4-2-3-1, he made a strong statement by benching the team's best defender Leonardo Bonucci following an on-pitch disagreement. Against Porto he saw his team slice Os Dragoes apart time and time again, and his defensive unit snuff out any meagre threat Porto showed. It was a big win in a lot of ways for Allegri. 3 Alex Sandro is the complete fullback \nThe modern fullback is an interesting case. With more and more teams employing inverted wingers, fullbacks have become more and more attacking, expected to contribute in the attacking third just as much, or more as in the defensive third. The best modern fullbacks have incredible engines, great technical skill, and the intelligence to balance attack with defense effectively. Alex Sandro's one of the most well-rounded fullbacks in the game today, and he showed it with another strong performance against his old team. Chris Brunskill Ltd Getty Images 4 Marko Pjaca is becoming Juventus' not-so-secret weapon \nBack in November, Max Allegri said Marko Pjaca would be \"decisive\" for the Bianconeri in 2017, and it's looking more and more like that may be the case. After signing with Juventus in the summer, he sat out almost all of 2016 after suffering a cracked fibula. Now, he's back from injury, the electric youngster is getting more and more minutes, and he's impressing. He came off the bench to change the game for Juventus, and his first ever goal for the club was the perfect reward for his work in such a short time. This content is subject to copyright. AFP/Getty Images 5 Miralem Pjanic has become a complete midfielder \nPjanic was known more for his attacking prowess than anything at Roma, but he was always a solid all-rounder. Now, at Juventus in their new 4-2-3-1, he's taken on more responsibility on both sides of the ball, and he's thrived in that role. His passing is incredible as always, but he's covering massive amounts of ground, tackling and intercepting passes on top of continuing to be one of Juve's most dangerous attacking threats. Against Porto he dominated in midfield, and should've had a couple of assists on the day. Gualter Fatia Getty Images 6 Porto's crowd was incredible \nTheir team didn't get a result on the day, but Porto's crowd were still amazing. The Estadio Dragao was rocking the entire time, and they never stopped making noise despite the foibles of their squad.
