Some books give you strict rules to learn, but this is not one of them. It takes the view that learning to draw anatomy is like starting to talk or to play an instrument. \nSo rather than spend too much time on theory, Daniela Brambilla instead sets a series of exercises and encourages you to learn by doing â€“ while learning from your mistakes.\nThis large-format, 260-page hardback covers almost every area of human figure drawing. It begins with the basics: gestures, contours and understanding position, proportions and lines of force. Then it&apos;s on to more advanced topics such as expanding your imagination and capturing \"the movements of the soul\", as Brambilla rather evocatively puts it. \n\nThere is a section to help you understand proportion and gestures With plenty of examples, and exercises that encourage you to get scribbling, it feels like a relaxed evening class held by the best teacher in town.\nThis article originally appeared in ImagineFX issue 143; buy it here. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T12:38:44.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
