For the third time in four years, the Grizzles stood in the way in a district final or later. \nThis one went Berea-Midpark’s way. Led by the junior duo of Jada Marone and Lexie Scarton , the Titans took down Wadsworth, 50-48, on Thursday night in the Division I Medina District championship game. \nThis same venue served as a launching pad to the Grizzlies’ state title run a year ago with an 80-50 rout in the district final. \n“I think there was a vengeance,” Marone said. “Last year they beat us 80-50. Thirty points? That was something driving us. That was not happening.” \nMarone worked quickly for Berea-Midpark (23-2), the tournament’s top seed and fifth-ranked squad in cleveland.com's final regular-season rankings . Marone scored 15 points and dished out five assists in a matchup that began smoothly but turned into a back-and-forth affair against the second-seeded Grizzlies (13-12). \nIt ended with two missed Wadsworth free throws. And Scarton, who clutched the basketball as the clock ticked down to zero. \n“We’ve played them three times and finally beat them, so it feels good,” said Scarton, who was a freshman for the Titans’ other postseason loss to Wadsworth in the 2015 regionals. \nBerea-Midpark advances the regional semifinals 7 p.m. Tuesday at Brecksville against Lakewood. The Rangers beat Medina, 49-41, in another district championship at Valley Forge. \nScarton helped the Titans advance with 15 points and the go-ahead 3 in the final four minutes. She also took control when Marone fouled out with 43 seconds left. \n“I’ll be honest, I’m a little surprised,” Berea-Midpark coach Kevin Braaten said, “because Jada does everything for us. But Lexie was a leader out there.” \nScarton said she simply reminded teammates to find their best foul shooters. \n“Hold the ball, don’t be stupid with it,” she said. \nWadsworth still managed one last chance, which concluded with coach Andy Booth drawing up a final play in the final 15 seconds. He used two timeouts in the sequence, and it led to a foul near the top of the arc with two seconds left. Wadsworth went to the free-throw line, but the first shot misfired off the rim. The second attempt, an effort to force an offensive rebound and putback, hit only glass and gave Berea-Midpark possession at the baseline. \nScarton wrestled away the inbounds pass from a Wadsworth defender, fell to the floor and picked herself up as the buzzer sounded. She ran to her teammates, who joined at midcourt to celebrate. \nJust a few feet away, Booth prepared to gather his team and console them. Wadsworth’s run of six straight district titles came to an end. \n“You want to use this as motivation to work in the spring and summer,” Booth said. “When you get into big games, district finals and regional level, your skill level needs to be taken care of in the off-season. Knowing these kids like I do, I think they’re going to rise to that challenge. I wish we could start practice again tomorrow for next year.” \nJunior forward Lexi Lance led Wadsworth with 14 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks. Fellow junior Peyton Banks added 11 points and nine boards. \nBerea-Midpark had its equalizer inside with senior Miranda Otero , the only senior starter on the Titans. She finished with just two points but had 14 rebounds. \n“It was rough,” Otero said. “Girls pull you down and everything like that, but you have to stay strong. You can’t give up.” \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
