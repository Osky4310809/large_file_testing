Minifying your WordPress CSS and Javascript files can make them load faster and speed up your WordPress site. In this guide, we will show you how to minify CSS/Javascript files in WordPress to improve performance and speed. \n\nWhat is Minify and When Do You Need it? The term ‘Minify’ is used to describe a method which makes your website file size smaller. It achieves this goal by removing white spaces, lines, and unnecessary characters from the source code. \nUsually it is recommended to be used only for files that are sent to user’s browsers. This includes HTML, CSS , and JavaScript files. You can minify PHP files too, but PHP is a server-side programming language and minifying it will not improve page load speed for your users. \nThe obvious advantage of minifying files is improved WordPress speed and performance . Compact files are faster to load and improve your site’s speed. \nHowever, some experts believe that the performance improvement is very small for most websites and not worth the trouble. The minification only decreases few kilobytes of data on most WordPress sites. You can reduce more pageload time by simply optimizing images for web .\nHere is an example of normal CSS code: \nbody {\nmargin:20px;\npadding:20px;\ncolor:# ;\nbackground:#f7f7f7;\n}\nh1 {\nfont-size:32px;\ncolor# ;\nmargin-bottom:10px;\n}\nAfter minifying the code it will look like this: \nbody{margin:20px;padding:20px;color:#333;background:#f7f7f7}h1{font-size:32px;margin-bottom:10px} \nIf you are trying to achieve 100/100 score on Google Pagespeed or GTMetrix tool , then minifying CSS and JavaScript will significantly improve your score. \nHaving said that let’s take a look at how to easily minify CSS/JavaScript on your WordPress site. \nMinify CSS/Javascript in WordPress First thing you need to do is install and activate the Better WordPress Minify plugin.

Right click anywhere and then select ‘View Page Source’ from browser menu. \n\nYou will now see the HTML source code generated by your WordPress site. If you look closely, you will notice that this plugin will load CSS/JavaScript files from plugin’s own folder instead of your WordPress themes and plugins. \nThese are the minified versions of your original CSS and JavaScript files.
