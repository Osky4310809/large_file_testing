The attacking student was angry because she had decided that one of the players — a white woman with braided hair — had committed “cultural appropriation,” police say. \nThe student who allegedly instigated the beatdown is Carmen Figueroa. She attends Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. \nPolice say Figueroa assaulted the two basketball players after a women’s basketball at Hampshire’s Robert Crown Center game on January 27, according to the Daily Hampshire Gazette , a newspaper out of nearby Northampton. \nThe victims of the alleged assault are members of the Central Maine Community College women’s basketball team. \nFigueroa, 20, approached the players after the game and demanded that at least one player remove braids from her hair, according to court records. \nFigueroa apparently decided the braids amounted to “cultural appropriation” because a Central Maine player who had the braids was white. \nThe white Central Maine player with braided hair opted not remove the braids and tried to leave the building. \nIn response, police say, Figueroa attacked her by pulling her braided hair so hard she fell to the ground. Once the unidentified player was on the ground, Figueroa allegedly kicked her and stepped on her. \nA second Central Maine tried to intervene, but Figueroa was having none of it. Figueroa “grabbed her by the head and threw her to the ground,” according to court documents obtained by the Daily Hampshire Gazette . \nCoaches tried to restrain Figueroa as she tried to wallop the players. \nFigueroa “was screaming swears and racial slurs” at the players by this time because of her rage about “cultural appropriation,” according to court documents. \nIt’s not clear if Figueroa was a spectator at the Jan. 27 game. She does not appear on the roster of 2016-2017 Hampshire College women’s basketball team. Images allegedly featuring Figueroa published by Turtleboy Sports suggest that she probably does not play much basketball. \nIn any case, the Central Maine Community College Mustangs resoundingly slaughtered Hampshire by a score of 91 to 39 . \nHampshire College charges $64,940 for a single year of tuition, fees and room and board. That’s $259,760 over the course of four years. \nA Hampshire College spokesman confirmed that Figueroa is enrolled at the expensive, private school but otherwise offered no comment. \n“ Cultural appropriation ” is seen as a very serious offense among social justice warriors on America’s college campuses. In a nutshell, it means borrowing elements from another culture without sufficient reverence and citation. In the worst cases, college radicals say, “cultural appropriation” is an extension of racism and even a form of genocide. \nFigueroa, who hails from Brooklyn, New York, has pleaded not guilty to charges of disorderly conduct, assault and battery and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. \nThe venue for her case is a district courtroom in Belchertown, Massachusetts. \nHampshire College is famous as a radical left-wing bastion with no majors, no grades and a campus designed in a horrendous prison-esque architectural style .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:08:09.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
