(Check out the trailer and see for yourself.)Momoa’s Aquaman character has the chance to be a scene-stealer in Justice League after his awesome appearance in the trailer, and that bodes well for the upcoming solo film too. \nJustice League, directed by Zack Snyder and co-starring Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, and Ciarán Hinds, hits theaters November 17, 2017. \nAquaman, directed by James Wan, and co-starring Willem Dafoe, Amber Heard, and Patrick Wilson, is slated for release on October 5, 2018.
