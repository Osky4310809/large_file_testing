Everything is there, even the signature. \nThe works will be presented as a physical, Instagram-esque representation, an homage to the social network that gave birth to the form. Each wall will feature a unique artist’s featured work, displayed like a profile page. The work displayed will be a series of memes already premiered online alongside brand-new content. Everything displayed will fall into the overall theme of “using memes to cope with reality,” ka5sh explains. Ultimately, if the goal of the meme is to find some catharsis, connection, or escape from the everyday world, the only thing keeping it from lining gallery walls is where they're most often viewed—the phone screen.
