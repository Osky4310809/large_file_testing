It may SOUND like a good idea. View this image › \nDisney One of the reasons it’s so bad is that it actually SOUNDS so great. Like, are you telling me I can use that $30,000 in my superannuation account as a deposit on an apartment in Melbourne? SIGN ME UP NOW!!\nBut economists, and former treasurers Peter Costello and Paul Keating, have said it’s really, really, really not a great idea. Why? Because it won’t achieve what it sets out to do. \nPrime minister Malcolm Turnbull called it a “thoroughly bad idea” back in 2015 .\n“This is not what the super system was designed for,” he said.\nID: 10694790 2.

This tax break is one that even the Property Council suggests could be curbed .\n“[Treasurer] Scott Morrison will stop at no stupid idea to avoid taking action on negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount,” Labor’s Chris Bowen said in a statement.\nThe government will release a housing affordability plan in the May budget.\nID: 10694794 4.
