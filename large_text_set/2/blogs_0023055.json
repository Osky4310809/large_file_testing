It is now being reported that Sara will make her debut in Student Of The Year 2 and that her father Saif Ali Khan has “confirmed” the same. \nBursts out a source very close to Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions: \nSaif has done no such thing. Saif only said his daughter Sara will make her debut in a Dharma film. That’s a fact. Saif didn’t say anything about Student Of The Year 2. Karan Johar has taken on himself the task of introducing Sara to the silver screen. During the last one year Karan has offered Sara EVERY Dharma production including Karan Malhotra ’s comedy with Hrithik Roshan (which has now been shelved) and Student Of The Year 2. \nHowever Sara has turned down Student Of The Year 2, and here’s why: \nIt’s very clearly a two-heroine one-hero film with Tiger Shroff playing the male lead. Sara will make her debut only in a solo-heroine film. Because of all the media pressure Karan is getting very anxious about Sara’s debut. He has taken on the responsibility of introducing her.And he wants Sara to be as successful as his other Student Of The Year debutante Alia Bhatt. The correct vehicle for Sara’s debut is awaited. 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:46:44.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
