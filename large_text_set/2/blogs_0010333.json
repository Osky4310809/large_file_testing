This year Burger King is getting in bed with it’s 18+ consumers by offering an “Adults Meal” that comes with a collection of “adult toys”, including a blindfold, kinky feather dusters, and one of those little massage brush things that feels really awesome when you run it through hair. Here’s the kicker: It’s only available in Israel.\nPersonally, I’m a big fan of the sexy neon glow logo for the stunt — a long patty that looks like a dick sandwiches between two smaller burger buns. Get it? Very coital imagery from Burger King. You also get the following grub:\n2 Whoppers\n2 packs of french fries\n2 beers\nSomeone really needs to open up a fast food/sex toy shop. The name Burger Kink just sells itself.\n\n \n \n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:12:57.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
