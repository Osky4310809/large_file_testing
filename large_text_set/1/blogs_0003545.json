On Christmas Day, Tigres beat America in a penalty shootout thanks to heroics from goalkeeper Nahuel Guzman and good finishing by their vaunted attackers. That performance gave the team its fifth-ever Liga MX title. \nOn Dia De Reyes, the tournament will begin once again, just 12 days after the champion was decided last time around. \"It would've been more natural to have had a longer break, but we like to play and are ready to start Saturday,\" Tigres midfielder Damian Alvarez said Tuesday. \nWe can't resist, even if there was hardly any time to miss Liga MX action. Here are the five most interesting, most scintillating, most intriguing questions in the league ahead of the kickoff of the Apertura on Friday. WHO CAN STOP TIGRES? \nFollow-up question: Can anyone? \nJust twice has a team been bicampeon in the short-tournament era, and only once — Leon in 2013 and 2014 — has a team captured titles in the Apertura and the following Clausura. It will be a challenge for Ricardo \"Tuca\" Ferretti's squad to win again so soon after its Christmas triumph. Yet the other teams around the league don't seem to be as strong as they once were. America is going through transition after its near-miss, crosstown rival Monterrey needs to figure out what went wrong in the fall, Pachuca watched Victor Guzman go to Chivas during the offseason, and while the Goats could be in the mix for the title, Matias Almeyda hasn't found consistency over a whole tournament yet. \nTigres could still lose a key piece or two in the winter window, but the majority of the squad is sticking around. The defense isn't going anywhere, and while Juninho and Hugo Ayala aren't getting any younger, they didn't show many signs of breaking down during the title run. With that defensive base and midfielders Guido Pizarro and Jesus Duenas in front of them, it will still be an achievement to score on Tigres. Stopping Andre-Pierre Gignac also will go down as an accomplishment for any club. History dictates it's another team's turn to lift the trophy. Tuca Ferretti sneers at history. CAN JEMEZ RETURN CRUZ AZUL TO GREATNESS? \nFollow-up question: Can he at least return them to respectability? \nA grande. A big club. Cruz Azul is supposed to be one of Mexico's four finest clubs, but it's been one in name only for the past several tournaments. After the team finally sent Tomas Boy packing in the fall, it turned to Spanish coach Paco Jemez to lead it back to the Liguilla for the first time since the 2014 Clausura. \nJemez is something different. This is his first job outside of Spain, and it's something of a novelty for a team to have a manager without experience in Mexico leading the way. Whether his brand of soccer works in Mexico remains to be seen. His signings have been interesting, with Jemez going to South America for three of his four big replacements and getting hulking Argentine central midfielder Gabriel Peñalba from Veracruz with his other move. How attackers Martin Rodriguez, who arrives from Colo-Colo, and Martin Cauteruccio, late of San Lorenzo, adapt to Mexico will speak to how Jemez's reclamation project goes in the capital. WHICH TEAM IS THIS TOURNAMENT'S XOLOS? \nFollow-up question: Is it Xolos again? \nNobody saw it coming, but in the recently concluded Apertura, Club Tijuana ran out to an early lead in the table and never relinquished it. With a strong defense and Dayro Moreno winning and converting a ridiculous amount of penalties and adding some very good goals from the run of play as well, Tijuana was nearly impossible to beat. Well, it was until the playoffs when Javier Torrente's Leon smashed the Xolos 3-0 in the first leg. Despite a frantic Xolos comeback in the first half of the second leg, Leon came back and Tijuana came up short. \nSo who is the team that will surprise this tournament? It could be Xolos again. Estadio Caliente has been restored as a venue opposing teams hate to visit, with the distance, the Friday night match times and the artificial surface all playing mental games with visitors. Moreno will be back after reported interest from China, and most of the team's core is still around. Young Mexican goalkeeper Gibran Lajud will take over the No. 1 spot after Federico Vilar's retirement and someone must fill the spot vacated by Gabriel Hauche's transfer to Toluca. \nLeon is also a candidate to top the table, with more time to work under Torrente. And Toluca, bolstered by Hauche's arrival and Rubens Sambueza joining from Club America, also could be stronger, though defense is still a concern. WHERE DOES AMERICA GO FROM HERE? \nFollow-up question: Will the team regret its winter moves? \nIf it was championship or bust for Mexico's most successful team historically, 2016 was a big bust. America responded to its defeat in the title match by offloading four players who had been part of the club's run to the final under coach Ricardo La Volpe. El Bigoton brought in a new goalkeeper in Agustin Marchesin, promising Costa Rican teenager Gerson Torres in the midfield and even younger midfielder Cristian Paredes from Paraguay. Whether those players and the existing depth America had are enough to maintain the good form Las Aguilas showed toward the end of 2016 remains to be seen. \nLa Volpe's mindset also will be something to watch. The coach mentioned quitting after expressing frustration with the officials in the final, but he's back to lead once again. The 64-year-old generally shows no hesitation in using young players. We'll see if this winter is a true youth movement or if La Volpe is ready for the team's Ecuadorian midfielders Renato Ibarra and Michael Arroyo to take the keys to America's attack. WHO'S GOING DOWN? \nFollow-up question: How are some of these teams still in the first division? \nMexico sends one team down every spring, and while there are plenty of teams mathematically in the danger zone, smart money is on Morelia, Chiapas or Veracruz being the team that gets sent down. Liga MX's system of including the results of six tournaments generally handicaps the most recently promoted team, but Necaxa accumulated so many points en route to a top-eight finish in the Apertura that Los Rayos look set for at least another season in the top division. \nMorelia, Chiapas and Veracruz, however, have years of only disappointment to fall back on. Morelia has 94 points from 85 matches while Veracruz has 96 and Chiapas just two more than that. Veracruz has desperately scooped up reinforcements in a quest to ward off the drop, though that seems a questionable strategy as the team could struggle to find chemistry as the year progresses. Morelia had an excellent first half to the tournament that just concluded and has taken a more measured approach. Chiapas has had enough trouble paying its players, much less assembling a quality lineup. In a European league, all three would go down, but only one will get a deserved fall from grace after so many disappointments. \nFollow JON ARNOLD on", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T17:31:14.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
