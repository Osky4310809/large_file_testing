The Obama administration had a similar policy in place. \nPresident Donald Trump had said during the campaign that he would “defund” sanctuary cities by taking away their federal funding. \nBut legal precedent suggests that would have been difficult to do. \nSanctuary cities include Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as many smaller municipalities. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
