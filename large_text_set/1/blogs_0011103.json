It forced overtime in the Wildcats’ latest boys basketball thriller with rival St. Edward . Davet’s shot led to a dominating overtime and 90-80 win for the Wildcats, ranked third in the cleveland.com boys basketball Top 25 . \n“Honestly I thought Mike had a good look at it even though it was long,” Davet said. “I thought it looked good, but I didn’t think it would go in.” The 3 from Matt Davet that forced overtime. Mayhem ensued. pic.twitter.com/87Wnx5YfH2 — Matt Goul (@mgoul) January 14, 2017 \nBecker passed Davet in the hallway, and told Davet he preferred a “swish” instead of a bank shot. Davet laughed after his 36-point performance. He also grabbed 10 rebounds as St. Ignatius (8-3) won its fifth straight. \nNo. 5 St. Edward (9-3) suffered its second loss in a week that came with a last-second shot in the fourth quarter. In the Eagles’ two-point loss Jan. 6 at No. 4 St. Vincent-St. Mary, they missed two winning 3-point tries in the final seconds. \nSt. Edward coach Eric Flannery said his players told him Friday in their huddle they did not want to foul. \n“I’m always going to go with the feeling of my guys,” Flannery said, “and he just made an unbelievable turnaround shot off the glass.” \nInstead, he thought free-throw shooting cost his bunch. The Eagles were 5-of-11 in the fourth quarter. \nSophomore guard Demetrius Terry and senior forward Kelvin Calhoun each scored 16 points. Forward Emmett Chambers added 13, while point guard Tommy Schmock scored 12 and guard Jack Sullivan added 10. \nDavet’s monster game came with a 16-point, 10-rebound effort from 6-8 senior Austen Yarian . Spear added 15 points, including seven in overtime. \n“It was insane,” Spear said. “Everyone was going crazy and the atmosphere was sick.” \nThe sold-out crown at St. Ignatius saw the Eagles jump out to a 7-0 lead — the largest difference until the Wildcats’ overtime burst with a 12-point run. They also rallied from six points in the final minute to force it. Davet hit three 3s in the fourth quarter, culminating with his buzzer beater. \n“I’ve watched him knock it down day in and day out in practice,” Becker said. “It was a little long, but it did the job.” \nAfterward, Davet said it reminded him of the shot Garfield Heights hit to beat the Wildcats in last year’s Division I regional final at Cleveland State. A 3 at the buzzer forced overtime in that one, too. \n“It’s our motivation to get back there,” Davet said. “It’s definitely what keeps us going in practice.” \nSt. Ignatius visits North Canton Hoover on Saturday as part of its Mercy Medical Classic. St. Edward travels Tuesday to No. 1 Lorain, which suffered its only loss in December to Hoover. \nFriday’s overtime game provided a similar feel to last season, when St. Edward won a double overtime game at home in its first meeting with the Wildcats. \nThey met twice more, including a district final. \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
