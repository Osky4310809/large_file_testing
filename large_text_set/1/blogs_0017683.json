Few of them are as beautiful looking as the recently launched Sky Dancer, from Vietnam-based developer Pine Entertainment.\nSee also: Best offline Android games 2 weeks ago \nIndeed, the minimalist art style for this game reminds one of the great Monument Valley. However, instead of trying to solve puzzles, the main objective of the “Sky Dancer” is to run, jump and fall from floating platforms, and hope that another one pops up to land on so you can keep running to the next floating platform. As you might expect, the controls are simple. You keep running automatically, with tapping on the left of the screen making your character move left, and tapping on the right to move to the right. Tapping on both sides at the same time causes the character to jump.\nThere are actually 10 different Sky Dancers you can pick from and more will be coming in future updates. While the game is free to download and play, be aware there are in-game purchases that are as high as $94.99, so you might want to be watching when your kids play it.
