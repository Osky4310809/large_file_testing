And in an article for Charisma , he shares three reasons why you should avoid it. \nThree awful reasons. \n1. The movie is pornographic in the extreme. It exhibits behavior so explicit and immoral that I will not repeat even what reviewers have said about it. Jesus warned us to refuse lust in all its forms (Matt. 5:28). His Spirit will be grieved by any Christians who open their minds to such blatant immorality. \nIt’s so pornographic… it’s rated R. Which is to say it’s not porn at all. If that’s “extreme,” wait till Denison learns about the internet. \n2. The plague of pornography is an epidemic in our culture, and these movies are making things far worse. They are intended to legitimize and normalize behavior that, according to researchers, damages the brain and escalates deviant behavior. \nI can think of 238942332 things worse for our culture than pornography. Reading Charisma is one of them. Also, as many critics will tell you , Fifty Shades Darker isn’t pornography. \n3. The movie normalizes sexual abuse. The timing could not be worse: according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 64 percent of American women have been victims of rape or other sexual violence. \nSexual abuse, by definition, removes consent from the equation. The sex depicted in Fifty Shades is all about consent. To equate the two suggests that Denison has no idea what the series is about. \nThere are plenty of good reasons not to see Fifty Shades Darker , including the fact that you have better things to do with your time. Like watching the seasons change. \nDenison doesn’t give you any of those good reasons. Like so much of what you see on Charisma , he relies on lies and fear-mongering. All the more reason to ignore him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:56:08.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
