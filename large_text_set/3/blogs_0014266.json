Maddow went on to point out that Melania Trump needed to bring that year’s tax return to get her citizenship interview she had in 2006. \n“And that tax return would be used as a very important piece of evidence as to whether or not she should get citizenship,” Maddow noted. “So you better believe the 2005 tax return is going to be sterling, right? That it’s going to display excellent citizenship and no red flags whatsoever.” \nMaddow would spend the rest of the segment detailing other reasons why the tax return would show that level of income and taxes paid. \nWatch the clip above, via MSNBC. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T04:39:28.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
