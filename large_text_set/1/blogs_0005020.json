King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 11 hours ago 17 Dave Lee, the former guitar tech of John Frusciante during his RHCP days, recently talked about what made the guitarist so \"difficult\" as a person.Lee tells JF Effects : \"John is a very kind person with a very big heart. Having said that, at times he could be difficult. He gets frustrated easily and becomes overwhelmed sometimes.\"He's very emotional. And his mood can be switched by the slightest thing. So I would say, as much as I love him as a person, I found it best to try to keep our relationship more a 'working' relationship rather than a friendship.\"He added: \"The Chili Peppers are a good organization to work for. The crew is well cared for and made as comfortable as is reasonable - nice hotels and travel arrangements. Aside from that, it's pretty much the same as touring with any band. Load in. Do a show. Load out. Go to the bus. The Chili Peppers crew are the nicest people I've ever worked with. Very fun, pleasant atmosphere.\"Asked about Frusciante's solo material, the tech replied: \"To be honest, John's solo music was recorded so close together and quickly that it's all kind of a blur to me. I seem to remember liking the Ataxia [a short-lived band John was a part of in early 2004 with current RHCP guitarist Josh Klinghoffer] stuff the best. Joe Lally [Ataxia bassist] is the nicest person in the world.\"As for John's electronic stuff: \"I've got to be honest. I'm not a big fan of electronic music. I'm glad it makes him happy. But I just don't get it. [Laughs]\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:58:46.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
