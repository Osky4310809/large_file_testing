Last season, the Orioles agreed to deals with eight of their 10 arbitration-eligible players before figures were exchanged. \nTeams and players can still negotiate after figures are exchanged and often come to agreements before arbitration cases come to trial. Last season, all 10 players reached terms before going to an arbitration case. \nAs heâ€™s been over the course of his five years with the Orioles, the 30-year-old Flaherty was a valuable player off the bench for the Orioles, playing six different positions, not included a mop-up pitching appearance. He hit .217/.291/.318 with three homers and 15 RBIs in176 plate appearances. \nThe Orioles other arbitration-eligible players are right-hander Chris Tillman, closer Zach Britton, third baseman Manny Machado, right-hander Brad Brach, second baseman Jonathan Schoop, right-hander Kevin Gausman, left-hander T.J. McFarland and catcher Caleb Joseph. \nLast month, the team tendered contracts to all but one of the arbitration-eligible players, the   Vance Worley , who was not made a contract offer by the team. \nFlaherty agreeing to terms was first reported by BaltimoreBaseball.com. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:34:36.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
