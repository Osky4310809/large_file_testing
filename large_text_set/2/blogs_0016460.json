But I never realised how bad it was. \n\"I would skip breakfast, and grab something convenient for lunch, often something from a cake shop or the supermarket and by dinner time I would be starving so I would eat all the wrong things. \n\"I would always have a side order and I would eat and eat at dinner, making up for the rest of the day.

I would try my best to be loud and bubbly on the outside but I would never stand up in front of people. I was embarrassed with the way I looked and would avoid photographs at all costs.\" \nWhen Louise was snapped at a Christmas party, her devastation at seeing the picture prompted her to change her lifestyle. \nShe said: \"I was so upset when I saw the picture and I knew then that I had to do something about it. I had done fad diets before with milkshakes and set meals but I always found they were things that I couldn't sustain. \n\"I would never have thought of joining Slimming World but my sister-in-law convinced me to give it a go.\" \nThe mother-of-one joined the Newhall branch of Slimming World in January 2014 and now weighs an incredible 11 stone and 3lbs. \nShe said: \"I was quite nervous about going as I was incredibly worried about what other people might think but it was lovely and there was no naming and shaming. \n\"The consultant was amazing and made me feel so comfortable and I started to set myself little goals throughout the journey.\" \nMrs Southam dropped a whopping 10 dress sizes and said she feels \"absolutely amazing.\" \nShe said: \"My daughter is 19 and we can share clothes now! It is so nice to be able to shop in normal shops and I have benefitted with my job, finishing a secondment and now having the confidence to train others. \n\"My weight loss has given me such a boost of confidence and it has 100 per cent changed my life. I feel so much healthier and I would never have imagined that I would halve my body weight.

The amount of people who have seen me before and after and have been inspired to join Slimming World is great. I am so proud of what I have achieved. \" \nMrs Southam said if she had her time again then she would want someone to tell her how bad her weight gain was getting, but she is more determined than ever to stay slim and healthy. \nShe said: \"If I had my time again I would want someone to tell me because I just didn't realise how bad it was and how much of an impact it was having on my life. I still go to Slimming World with my mum and my sister even though I am completely happy with the way I look now. \n\"Luckily, I have had heaps of support and it has really made the difference to my journey. I have been at my target weight for more than 12 months now and I like going to group so that I can share my experience and help others.\" \nDespite her drastic weight loss, Louise still treats herself with the dieting programme's so-called syns allowance. \nShe said: \"I tend to use my syns for sauces such as mayonnaise but I do like to treat myself to a chocolate Freddo frog. Everyone who does Slimming World knows how lovely a Freddo can be and it is important not to feel like you are depriving yourself. \n\"Right now I am happier than ever and my aim is to maintain the weight I am and to look to the future.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:16:04.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
