If there is any club Jonas is interested in, then we would talk to them. \n\"But Jonas didn’t say that he wants to leave the club and go to Chelsea so it doesn’t matter. \n“If someone wants to leave the club then we have to talk about it, but not before.\" \n'Payet refusing to play for West Ham' \nAlonso has thrived in Conte's 3-4-3 formation, operating in the left wing-back role, and his introduction has coincided with Chelsea's stunning run of form. \nHector, who has strongly linked with a move to Liverpool last summer, has played every minute of Koln's Bundesliga campaign so far this term.
