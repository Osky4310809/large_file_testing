Share Diego Costa has had his head turned (Photo: CameraSport via Getty) Share Get Chelsea     \nDiego Costa really doesn’t like England does he?! \nThe food, the weather, the language, the football. They’ve all been used as reasons why he’s unhappy at Chelsea , for about the last three years as far as I can see. \nI can’t tell you if any of the reasons are genuine, but I can tell you I’d have more respect for him if he said the biggest reason he’s unhappy is because he wants to take the Chinese money. \nIf it’s true he’s being offered £800,000 a week, I wouldn’t condemn him at all. He’s 28, he’s won the league with Chelsea and has been a big part in why they will probably do it again this season. \nHe has no loyalty to England, no ties. He came here to earn good money at Stamford Bridge and win medals, and he’s done that. He’s already travelled half way round the world to make a living, so going to China is a natural step towards the end of his career. \nWho can say with their hand on heart they wouldn’t be interested in such mind-blowing sums? But for other reasons too.

I’d actually applaud him for having the courage to be one of the first...though £800,000 a week would be enough to make me braver. I'd get in the ring with Conor McGregor for that. \nIt’s been tough to read the smoke signals this week, but Costa seems to have called an uneasy truce with Chelsea, suggesting he will stay until the end of the season at least. \nI’m not entirely convinced it’s a good idea by Chelsea though, because I think it’s pretty obvious he wants to go, and you worry with Costa when his mind isn’t on the game. \nI’ve said before how much I rate him – but he needs to be super focussed. You’ve seen it when he gets too wound up and starts worrying more about his opponents than the game itself. He’s no where near as effective. \nIt’s clear he needs to be happy to give his best, so there are no guarantees he’ll be on it this weekend. And there is the problem for Antonio Conte. \nI’ve been there myself in being unsettled, though for very different reasons. There were a couple of times in my career when I was so unhappy I wasn’t playing, that I had fall outs with the manager, and probably took my eye off the focus on the pitch. \nIt can have an effect, because it seeps through into the squad, and sometimes there can be a bit of a bad smell around the training ground, around the team. No player who is unhappy is ever any good for a squad, when it’s someone as important as Costa, it can be particularly dangerous. Costa has been Chelsea's top marksman (Photo: Reuters) \nNot that Chelsea looked too bothered at Leicester last week. And let’s face it, they could probably play Hull with me up front this weekend and still get the win they need. \nIn the longer term though, Conte will need all his man-management skills to ensure that if Costa stays, he keeps him motivated and focussed. \nThe club’s title hopes could depend on it. I know they have a big gap at the top, and I know many people have argued that the lead they have will allow them to manage the rest of season, and pick up points strategically while Conte keeps things tight at the back. \nYet the striker has so often been the difference between them winning and not this season, and look at their fixtures over the next few weeks when they play Liverpool and Arsenal. \nIf Liverpool win, then it puts pressure on the next two fixtures, and when a team is under pressure, any weak links get exposed. If there is any friction in the squad – and we saw a bit of unpleasantness between Costa and Pedro that suggested something’s going on – then it will come out during those games. \nAt least the drama with Costa has livened up the title race a little. \nI’m a huge admirer of Conte and I think he’s got things organised enough to be able to navigate this situation. \nIf he wins the title, then he’ll have done a proper job. And then, Mr Costa can go off to China. Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T12:30:20.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
