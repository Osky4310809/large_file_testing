Millwall's Morison targets FA Cup knockout with Leicester on the ropes \nIt shows a passion for the game and reminds me of going to places such as Old Trafford and Goodison Park as a Liverpool player. \nEven if the hostility doesn’t affect you, it usually gives a boost to the home team. So often, fans can dictate the way their players perform, for better and for worse. \nThis is a tricky game for Leicester. Against a club in a lower division, you normally trust your superior ability, but their confidence is low. \nPlayers such as Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy are struggling and the Foxes are failing to weather a storm. \nIf Millwall can win this one and the quarter-final draw is kind, they can start dreaming about repeating their 2004 campaign, when they reached the final.
