If you’re planting outdoors, it’s also a good time to clear out weeds to keep them from seeding in your soil when the weather turns warm. It’s also a great time to sow next year’s seedlings. Advertisement \nCold weather might not seem like the best condition to start your seedlings, but as Garden Fundamentals explains in the video above, exposing seedlings to this harsher weather makes them hardier and means they’re ready to go as soon as you can start planting.
