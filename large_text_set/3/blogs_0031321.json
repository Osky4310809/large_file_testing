Battered cockatoo and other tales of the storm \n\"Conditions have deteriorated rapidly,\" Mr Turnbull told parliament. \"Take care and stay safe. Be prepared to shelter in place until Wednesday.\" \nHe said the government would be urging insurance companies to be \"compassionate\" and supportive of people who had claims to make following the cyclone. 'Battering ram effect' \nThe extent of Cyclone Debbie's devastation, which has a 50km-diameter eye wall, may not be known for some time, the authorities said. \nQueensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said the storm's slow speed had created a \"battering ram effect\", adding: \"We are going to get lots of reports of damage, and sadly I think we will also receive reports of injuries, if not death.\" \nMr Stewart said the weather had contributed to the death of a woman in a car crash on Monday. \nOne man was seriously injured when a wall collapsed in the town of Proserpine. \nQueensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said assessing damage was difficult because communities had been cut off from power and phone reception. \n\"Everyone is going to be in shock tomorrow, just to see the full impact of this cyclone,\" she said. \"I'm bracing myself for it.\" \nMore than 2,000 emergency workers are on standby, but people have been warned crews will only respond when it is safe to do so. \nOfficials warned people to stay indoors until it was safe to go outside, while electricity providers said it was not known when power would be restored to houses. \n\"We're going to see the impact of Cyclone Debbie for the next three to five days,\" Ms Palaszczuk said. \nShe also condemned people spotted surfing during the cyclone as \"irresponsible\" and \"ridiculous\".

Crucially, it is also very slow-moving. That \"can be more damaging because the duration of strong winds is longer. As structures experience a longer battering, things like metal fatigue set in, leading to more damage. Also, more of the rain falls in the same area rather than being spread out, leading to a greater flood risk\". What is the predicted damage? \nFortunately Debbie looks likely to head between two cities so \"the destruction is likely to be somewhat less than feared\". And while tourists are less able to evacuate from the resorts that have been hit more directly, their hotels are \"likely to have higher foundations\" and be built more solidly than many ordinary homes near the coast. Panic over? \nNo. The storm will still be around even as it downgrades but, as a silver lining, it could bring some relief to farmers affected by drought. \"Hopefully that will bring a bit of rain to the interior,\" Professor King says. \nMore: Flinders University's cyclone visualisation \nAre you in the area?
