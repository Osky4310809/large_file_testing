Apps and online services promise that help is just a few taps away, and in some cases they may be the right choice for you. Some Apps Use Real Therapists—But They’re Not the Same as Face to Face Therapy Image via Unsplash \nIf you can’t see a professional face-to-face, the next best thing may be chatting with one on your phone. Some services offer video and voice calls, while others center around texting. It’s not just nervousness that might lead you to put the distance of technology between yourself and your therapist: you may find that you can’t get an appointment with a real person without months of waiting. And even though your insurance plan must cover mental health services the same way they cover the rest of your care, that may still involve a significant out-of-pocket cost. \nOne solution is to have a video visit with a psychiatrist through a telemedicine service like Teladoc or Amwell . Amwell prices its first visit at $200 and later visits at $90, but points out that seeing somebody face-to-face could cost double that. The cheaper price tag and the convenience of online access may make it easier for you to take that first step toward therapy—so that’s still a plus. Can You Visit a Doctor Without Leaving the House?

For a flat fee that works out to about $150 per month, you can chat with your therapist anytime. Betterhelp offers both approaches. Some real-world therapist practices also offer their services online, so if you have worked with one in the past, consider asking if they have an app that can help you get in touch more easily next time. Advertisement Advertisement \nHowever, these services may not provide the same close connection to a human being that you would get from traditional therapy, says clinical psychologist Shaun Wehle. “Fear can be treated in some ways by having an accepting ‘other’ sitting across from you,” he says. But if somebody avoids therapy because they aren’t ready to face a human, or if they have an appointment in a few months but need help right now , online therapy can bridge that gap. \nThe American Psychiatric Association says that therapy by video is “a validated and effective practice of medicine that increases access to care” as long as it’s in the patient’s best interest and as long as it complies with the APA’s policies on medical ethics and confidentiality. \nUnfortunately, that might not be the case for all of these services. The Verge reports that Talkspace preserves your anonymity so strongly that therapists can’t follow state laws about reporting child abuse, or get emergency help for somebody who is suicidal. On some services, your provider may not be licensed in the same state where you are, making a legal gray area when it comes to state laws. You Can Do Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on Yourself (Within Limits) Image by Ady Satria Herzegovina \nIf talking to a real therapist is too expensive or intimidating, the other end of the spectrum is an entirely human-free self help service. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can work this way, and studies consistently show online CBT works as well as face-to-face therapies for a variety of common problems, including anxiety and depression.

CBT is one of the… Read more Read more \nI used an online CBT program myself last year, when I was working on a book in addition to my usual freelance deadlines, and ended up feeling so stressed out that sometimes I was unable to focus or calm down. I found the free e-couch program from Australian National University , which begins with lessons that teach you about anxiety (if you’re doing the anxiety program). Based on a quiz there, I found that my symptoms were less severe than what people with generalized anxiety disorder experience, but that I would still probably benefit from the program.

The program suggested that I try meditation, which definitely helped me learn to calm down when I felt the stress building up. Ultimately, the heart of the program was a set of problem-solving steps, similar to what’s in this flowchart . I wrote about a worry I was having, evaluated whether it was realistic, brainstormed solutions, chose between them, and then returned to the website the next day to write down whether the solution had helped or not. \nThis wasn’t therapy in the same sense as talking to a person, although face-to-face therapy can also be a way of learning CBT techniques. It was more like re-training my brain to think about problems in a different way, solving them instead of worrying about them.

Better yet, if a coach can support you, they can help you stick to the program. That’s the approach that Joyable takes with social anxiety, providing a CBT program and a coach for $99/month. \nSince these programs aren’t medical practices, they aren’t necessarily subject to the same privacy laws. Dr. Stair says her company has taken steps to keep customer data secure from hackers, but they don’t have to abide by laws like HIPAA that govern how companies may handle medical records. Volunteer Coaches Can Provide a Human Connection Image via Unsplash \nThere is a middle ground between these two approaches: talking to a person who is not a professional, licensed therapist. 7 Cups of Tea works this way, connecting paying customers with non-professional “listeners.” Blah Therapy offers chat sessions with professionals for a fee, or with volunteers for free.

The session ended with the patient logging off, and deciding he would talk through his problems with his sister. \nThe biggest risk of seeking help from any of the apps or services we’ve mentioned is if you need real, quality therapy, and don’t end up getting it. If your situation is severe or life threatening (for example, if you are having suicidal thoughts), an app might not be in your best interest. Advertisement \nEven for smaller problems, you could be disappointed if you try one of these services and find it doesn’t work for you. “If [online therapy] doesn’t help, it doesn’t mean you can’t be helped,” Dr. Wehle stresses. You may just need to try a different approach. \nUltimately, where you seek help depends on what your problem is. If you’re not sure, it may be best to seek a professional’s help to assess your situation, and then choose the avenue that best meets your needs. If you’re in a difficult situation and need to make that decision now, a variety of crisis hotlines are only a phone call away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:44:31.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
