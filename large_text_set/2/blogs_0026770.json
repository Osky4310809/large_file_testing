You're getting the blood flowing, breathing some fresh air, and decompressing just a bit. Casual. And then — holy crap is that Serena Williams?!?\nYes, that is Serena Williams . What's more, she says this story is one with a moral: You never know when the GOAT might crash your game of tennis.\nSEE ALSO: Finally, there's a Mike Tyson iPhone emoji for every situation\nWilliams was out for a stroll in San Francisco's Mission District on Sunday night when she came across two chill bros playing some tennis at Dolores Park. She was wearing a pair of fuzzy slipper-like boots instead of her usual tennis shoes — but that didn't stop her from jumping in the game.\nThe very awesome encounter — from Williams first spying the game, to the two players' stunned reactions — was documented on her Snapchat channel. Here's a look, via ForTheWin 's Alysha Tsuji .\nSerena played tennis in boots with these 2 guys she saw on a court while she was out on a walk last night. IMAGINE. pic.twitter.com/kWXrTE73M9\n— Alysha Tsuji (@AlyshaTsuji) February 27, 2017\n\"So the moral of the story is,\" Williams says, while a bit breathless after the game, \"you never know when I could be coming to a tennis court near you.\"\nBut it probably helps that this particular tennis court happens to be located in San Francisco, where Reddit is headquartered. Reddit's co-founder is Alexis Ohanian, to whom Williams became engaged last December.\nBut still. We won't blame tennis players the world over for holding out just a little bit of hope now that Williams might crash their own game one day.\nPerhaps just as remarkable in these mega-branded times, the encounter appears to be just a bit of spontaneous fun, not some native ad for a sneaky company . That might be the best part of all of this.\nBONUS: Even police are making jokes about that monster f*ck up at the Oscars", "external_links": ["https://t.co/kWXrTE73M9", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/m8N6rv73.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/04/07/after-david-ortiz-selfie-white-house-draws-red-line/?utm_term=.1e2dd3b6ebb1", "https://twitter.com/AlyshaTsuji/status/836268697115205632", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/m8N6rv73.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-28T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:55:00.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
