Billy Moore in action for North Sydney Bears.   \n“To say Blocker (Roach) was upset would be an understatement. He jumped up, 120 kilos, went to town on me, split my ear, I got eight stitches. \n“Among all the chaos I looked up, the punches had stopped and there’s Pat Jarvis who had grabbed hold of Blocker, sorting him out. \n“I’ve jumped up and said ‘lucky you got in there Pat I was just about to get up’. \n“The next day Jarvis picked me up and took me to Newtown Police Boys Club to meet a guy called Johnny Lewis, the great (boxing trainer) Johnny Lewis. \n“He was fantastic, he said: ‘Come on in mate I’ll show you how to box, how to look after yourself’. He said come in and meet the boys. \n“I walked into the boxing ring and he goes here’s Jeff Fenech, triple world champion, I said, ‘How good’s that?’ He said here’s Jeff Harding, just beat Dennis Andries, world champion. \n“Then (Lewis) said wait on there’s someone else, a bigger bloke, he’s more famous ... and I thought, ‘Who could be more famous than a triple world champion and a world champion?’ \n“He goes, ‘Here he is, it’s Steve Roach, he beat you up yesterday.’” \nBen Ikin, Nathan Ryan and Ben Glover examine Jason Taylor’s sacking at the Wests Tigers and how it impacts the club and its roster going forward. \nYou can also subscribe via iTunes or for Android users, listen on the iPP Podcast Player app. \nMAL MENINGA \nWhy I put a hit on Michael O’Connor \nIt was 1991 and the State of Origin series was squared at one win apiece. \nNSW centre Michael O’Connor has slotted a sidelined conversion to steal victory from Queensland in Origin II, and Meninga wasn’t going to let it happen again. \nHe rushed out of the defensive line to smash O'Connor early in game three, then followed it up with a wild arm to the head of his opposition centre. \n“I was a very fair player in my time, played fair but hard. \n“One moment I regret now — well I don’t regret it — was in an Origin series in 1991. \n“The series was 1-all, Wally (Lewis) has come out before the game and told all us players it was his last game. Mal Meninga’s statue meets Mal Meninga.   \n“Last game, playing at Lang Park in a decider, so we got all emotional about it, and because of that we wanted to send him out a winner. \n“(O’Connor) was one of their great players, he kicked a goal right from the sideline in the dying seconds of game two that won them the game. \n“We could do those (hits) in those days, that was Origin, that was the emotional charge of Origin. \n“I would’ve been suspended today.” \nJUSTIN HODGES \nHow I shook off a bad game, and why NSW hated it \n“For me it was about being aggressive, that’s what Origin football is about. \n“Sometimes you get into a game and you’re not feeling as great, you’re not getting the ball, so my thing was always my aggression in the tackle trying to lift my teammates. \n“There’s times there where you have to, especially in the Origin arena. \n“If you can win the battle over your opposite player physically and mentally you’re going a long way toward your team winning, and that’s what it takes sometimes. Justin Hodges gets physical with Aaron Woods.   \n“Sometimes I’d be standing out there not getting the ball, so you have to make an impact in one way or another to inspire your teammates, and my way was always getting down there and being aggressive. If the fullback or winger got the ball put him on the ground and put his head into the ground. \n“That’s what you want, you’re putting fear in the opposition.” \nHodges’ former Queensland coach Mal Meninga revealed his star centre’s aggression was often a tactic employed by the team. \n“ When I was coaching Origin we knew if Justin was aggressive, and if Greg (Inglis) was aggressive, the two centres ... the team was in good stead.” \nLive stream all 26 rounds of the NRL premiership on FOX SPORTS.
