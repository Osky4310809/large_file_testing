From the Urban Legends Mailbag Kathrin Ziegler/Taxi/Getty Images Updated June 18, 2016 . \nDear Urban Legends: \nAn urban legend that I've heard (most recently by a teacher during a discussion in a high school English class) is that you shouldn't throw rice at weddings, because after the party is over, birds will come and eat it. White rice, being as dehydrated as it is, will immediately begin absorbing water upon entering the moist environment of the bird's body. It will then swell up, and if there is enough of it in there, the bird's body (specifically the crop, where the food first goes to be stored) will burst, killing the poor little critter. Is there any truth to it? \nDear Reader: \nNo truth to it at all, according to ornithologists , who say rice is perfectly safe for birds to eat. Wild rice is a dietary staple for many birds, after all, as are other grains that expand when they absorb moisture (wheat and barley, for example). \nOne thing purveyors of this myth fail to take into account is that the rate at which dried grains absorb liquids is pretty darned slow except when it takes place at cooking temperatures. \ncontinue reading below our video Great Singers Gone too Soon In addition, there's a biological process you may be familiar with called digestion. Long before any uncooked rice consumed by a bird could expand and cause harm, it would have already been ground up in the bird's crop and well into the process of being broken down into nutrients and waste by the acids and enzymes in its digestive tract. \nIt's unclear exactly how and when this misconception originated, though it was most famously promulgated by advice columnist Ann Landers in 1988 when she published a letter warning prospective brides and grooms against the practice of throwing rice at weddings: \nDear Ann: I have never seen this issue raised in your column, but it is something every prospective bride should think about, especially those who love birds. \nI am getting married in September and I'd like to have birdseed thrown instead of rice. Hard, dry rice is harmful to birds. According to ecologists, it absorbs the moisture in their stomachs and kills them. \nHow can I get this message across to my guests, without sounding like some kind of a nut? My fiance is a bird lover, too, and says it's OK with him if I say this in the invitation. -- K.M.M., Long Island \nCredulous as always, Landers noted in her reply that a Connecticut legislator had recently proposed a ban on rice throwing at weddings for precisely that reason. This was greeted with skepticism by bird experts everywhere, including Cornell ornithologist Steven C. Sibley, who wrote in a letter subsequently quoted by Landers, \"There is absolutely no truth to the belief that rice (even instant) can kill birds. . . . I hope you will print this information in your column and put an end to this myth. In the meantime, keep throwing rice, folks. Tradition will be served and the birds will eat well and be healthy.\" \nSources and further reading:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:42:25.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
