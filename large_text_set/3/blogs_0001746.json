His alter ego Eclipse can absorb and manipulate photons. Also cast in the show so far are Jamie Chung ( Big Hero 6 , Gotham ), who plays the mutant Blink, and Blair Redford ( The Day the Earth Stood Still ). \n“Developing a Marvel property has been a top priority for the network–and we are so pleased with how Matt Nix has led us into this thrilling universe,” Fox Entertainment president David Madden said back in July when the show was announced. “There’s comic book adventure, emotional and complicated relationships, and a rich, existing mythology from which to draw. With the brilliant production crew behind this project, it has all the makings of a big, fun and exciting new series.” \nTeale is also known for his role on Skins and on The CW series Reign .
