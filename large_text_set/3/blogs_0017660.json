(ANI) \nUnion Minister Venkaiah Naidu praised the new CM designate of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath on Friday. Ahead of the swearing-in ceremony of Yogi Adityanath, the minister said he is an “honest man” and nobody can raise a finger on his commitment. The state went through its assembly polls recently, in which Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) made a huge victory with winning on 325 seats out of 403 seats. Soon after this, the question raised of who would be the new CM of the state. Giving full stop to all the discussions, the party decided its MP from Gorakhpur Yogi Adityanath to be appointed on the designation who will set to take oath today. Elated on the decision of the party, Naidu stressed upon his capability to hold the position and said it is evident from his five-time win from the same seat. “Winning from the same seat five times is not a small thing,” he said. He further stressed upon Yogi’s commitment for the betterment of the state, as he said that Yogi himself openly requested him for two Deputy CMs who would help him, as Uttar Pradesh is a big state. “The trio will be a good combination,” added he. \nYou may also like to watch: \nMeanwhile, BJP leaders have started arriving for the swearing-in ceremony. So far, Swantantra Dev Singh, Arun Kumar Singh and Bhupendra Yadav have come. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are expected to arrive shortly. After the swearing in ceremony, Yogi Adityanath will take charge as CM in Lok Bhawan which will be followed by a meeting with ministers. He was earlier slated to visit Gorakhpur ahead of oath taking ceremony. However, he has cancelled the plan for now and is presently at a VVIP Guest House in Lucknow. He will address his first press conference after that at 5 PM. There are high-security arrangements at the venue. About 30,000 policemen have been appointed at Lucknow’s Kanshiram memorial ground. \nYogi Adityanath who is a five-time Lok Sabha MP from Gorakhpur, was elected BJP Legislature Party leader at a meeting of MLAs in Lucknow on Saturday.
