He will now join the annals of history alongside George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. \nNo matter your political beliefs, this speech will be worth watching as it’s the closing of one chapter and the beginning of another in our collective national history. \nThe speech will be aired on major media networks, including NBC, CBS, and ABC, as well as airing on the White House website . You can also tune in right here and watch his entire speech below. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:47:19.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
