But this wasn't a regular day, however. For a fashion novice like myself, when you have to spend an entire day at the recently concluded Lakm é Fashion Week, it seldom is. W hen your editor asks you to do something--you just do it. After all, like a baniya ’s mom once said, “ K oi dhanda chota nahi hota.” Here is what unfolded. Last week we decided to do a few interviews at LFW . Inevitably, I was incredibly nervous about what I'd wear. I eventually ended up in my roommate’s canvas shoes and made a dash for the venue at Jio Garden (despite the tiny hole in the sole that did a mini asthma-wheeze every time I took a step). First up, we got a chance to meet Daniel Bauer , who is the go-to hair stylist for divas like Deepika Padukone and Alia Bhatt. He dealt with hair with the skill and deftness of an origami artist. A fine chap with a fascinating moustache. He didn’t make much eye contact with me though. I presume it was either my wheezing shoes or my unkempt and overgrown hair. Amidst constantly firing blow-dryers and fussy assistants, he showed us a demo with ace model Isabella. A surreal beauty whose perfectly flawless face had not a single imperfect skin cell. No matter how much I zoomed in. Look at the video yourself. \nThe sun was up by then. And my brain had finally woken up and aligned itself with the universe. The Jio Gardens was a giant surreal quadrangle venue with the show areas and refreshment lounges set up on either sides. Giant tele-screens relayed the shows and the designers headlining them and the speakers pulsed with the kind of bizarre music you’d expect at some EDM gig with the crowd trippin' balls. \nFirst, I contemplated if it was too early in the day for beer (roughly at about 11 am). After a quick glance at the drinks menu, I settled for coffee. The lawn had an open bar at the centre with roofs like giant mushrooms. Ahead of it was a weirwood tree (refer Game of Thrones) with blazing red leaves and curious glass balls hanging from it. There was a miniature wall in one corner with some cringy graphics and a big heart shaped hole with ‘LOVE’ written on the side. At the far end of the lawn was parked a yellow Lamborghini, surrounded by people taking selfies. Despite the crowd (of mostly well dressed women), the place, to me, at least looked akin to a college fest. Read: Kaleidoscope or Moodi, possibly. Apparently Mumbaikars are more relaxed and chilled out in their fashion sensibilities than Delhi folks, I was enlightened by my fashion evolved co-workers. Who knew, right? I met a lot of interesting people wearing, well, interesting stuff. Wonderfully nice men and women, whose names I almost immediately forgot. It was an education in the who’s who of the Indian fashion blog-o-sphere. Everyone did seem to know everyone else. Or so I thought till someone came and took a selfie with us and disappeared back into the crowd. Shooting interviews in the sun is hard work. Especially if you're lugging around your Canon 6d with a backpack bag, tripod stand, and a microphone, all the while trying to make sure your phone, power bank and wallet don’t get misplaced. \nOne of the tattooed bartenders spun us a Capriosca Thai Orange . A man of epic integrity nonetheless who refused when a model offered a 500 buck tip. “ Mera reputation kharab hoga, ” he told me later with nonchalance. The media lunch hall was a much less glamorous tent outside the ‘quadrangle’. Everyone who came there looked tired and under-slept. The buffet served some incredible chicken gravy and chocolate mousse, though. There's something about free food, always. I admit. Wired up on sugar and dining table gossip, I headed back into the sun to shoot some street styles. I'd point at possible ‘well dressed’ candidates with the enthusiasm of a Nat-Geo photographer hunting exotic Amazonian pigeons. My fashion forward colleague would then patiently explain to me which ones were ‘kitsch’ and which ones were dressed like peacocks on crack. “Plus they aren’t even influencers,” she explained further. At which point I’d shut up. Our relentless social media team back in office could function 24x7 without food or water if we fed them enough pics and videos. So we checked out the Media Centre for the free wifi. The MC was basically a giant computer lab set up inside a tent. There were fellow media men huddled up around their computers, their equipment strewn everywhere, transferring precious data in the short time they had between shows. There was a fridge in the corner with an infinite supply of palm-sized water bottles. And a vending machine that spat out caffeinated-sugar-water, run by a creepy guy who couldn’t stop staring. “Where is the smoking zone?”, I curiously asked a random event manager. “Uhh sir...?”, he looked at me blankly for a moment, like I had asked him the square root to a pineapple. Then, as if answering an ethereal call from the horizon, he just walked off in a trance. Apparently the Jio Garden venue had a strict no smoking policy, much to the chagrin of all those who didn’t carry drinks money. By now (at about 6 pm), the DJ had switched to more peppy numbers. I was guided into a tiny apartment-looking room showcasing a designer whose name, for the life of me, I can’t remember. Later I was told it was The Apartment. But there was wine and fried prawns. I felt like a bull in a China shop, lugging around all the equipment in the crammed room, so I excused myself before the refill arrived. As I stood on the lawn, I saw an ad on the giant tele-screen that looked vaguely familiar. It was about two people trying to communicate across a wall that had barbed wires. A guy breaks a hole in the wall with a hammer, goes to the other side and kisses the first dude. Someone then spray paints the word “LOVE” next to the heart shaped hole in the wall. It all had something to do with Diesel. Just then a line of models marched out of one of the rooms and positioned themselves a few feet away from me in a line. Before I could decide if I should take my camera or run, a crowd gathered around me and started clicking pictures. One model held a placard that read “GKASQAHFSHKAJH”. I went down a crazy labyrinth of people and walls and went backstage next. In the giant green room, I saw an army of models getting decked up, by an army of makeup and hair stylists, for a show later that evening. And there were male models as well with weird hairdos and blue eye shadows. This would be the closest I’d get to a fashion show I realised, so I tried not to drop my tripod and kill anyone. I found myself sitting beneath the weirwood tree. Apparently some of the the red leaves had fallen to the ground. I picked one up. It was plastic. But good quality. The glass balls on the red tree lit up then. The music that blared incessantly through the speakers no longer seemed to be in sync with the tele-screen’s stream of perfectly moving models. Maybe it was the exquisite wine. There a lady in a multi-coloured poncho with a feather in her hair, who was swaying from side to side, arms raised with a drink in each hand, reminiscing her last hippie communion. I left my camera gear in her care and went up to the yellow Lamborghini parked in the corner of the lawn. And clicked a selfie. \nThe models were all done for the day and were slowly leaving the venue. Tall perfect creatures, pulling their luggage behind them, disappearing into not-so-glamorous auto rickshaws. That's Maximum City for you. I posted my selfie on Whatsapp. “Maybe I do need that haircut after all”, I thought to myself as I booked an Uber home.
