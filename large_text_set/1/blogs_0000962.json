Philstar.com, file New Year homily laments ‘spiritual orphanhood’ \nVATICAN CITY – Pope Francis in his New Year’s homily lamented societies becoming “cold and calculating” and bereft of compassion. \nHe told the faithful during mass in St. Peter’s Basilica yesterday that those with “narcissist hearts” suffer the loss of the “ties that bind us” and the sense of belonging in society. \nFrancis says more humility and tenderness are needed in the world, calling those qualities signs of strength, not weakness. \nHe expressed concern for what he called “spiritual orphanhood.” \nSpeaking on the day the 1.2-billion-member Roman Catholic Church marked its World Day of Peace, Francis said peace was constructed by saying no to hate and violence and yes to brotherhood and reconciliation. \nIn his homily, Francis said the lack of physical contact among people brought on by modern means of virtual communication “is cauterizing our hearts and making us lose the capacity for tenderness and wonder, for pity and compassion.”   \nOn Saturday, the pontiff in his year-end message urged leaders to do more to tackle youth unemployment, saying a generation was being lost to desperation, migration and joblessness. \nAt his last public event of 2016, an evening vespers service, the 80-year-old Francis said doors had to be opened for young people “so that they can be capable of dreaming and fighting for their dreams.” \n“We have condemned our young people to have no place in society, because we have slowly pushed them to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist or fail to promise them a future,” he said in his homily. \nYouth joblessness in Italy stands at more than 36 percent and tops 18 percent among the 28 European Union states. \nIn Africa, the continent with the world’s youngest population, youth unemployment probably increased in 2016, and was near 30 percent in North Africa, according to the International Labor Organization. \nPoverty and lack of opportunity in Africa are driving migration, particularly to Europe. Almost 5,000 men, women and children died attempting to reach Europe by boat from North Africa in 2016. \nAmong the more than 181,000 boat migrants – mostly African – who reached Italy in 2016, 25,000 were unaccompanied minors, double the number who came in 2015. \nAt the end of the service, Francis walked across St. Peter’s Square, stopping to shake hands and pose for pictures, as he paid a brief visit to the life-size nativity set up outside. \nYesterday, the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics said Mass to mark the Church’s World Day of Peace. \nAfter the solemn ceremony at the flower-bedecked altar, Francis addressed the tens of thousands of pilgrims, tourists and locals who gathered in St. Peter’s Square.
