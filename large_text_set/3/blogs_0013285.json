But even if you’re not one for cookies, you can still relive your summer nostalgia with a flavor like Pink Lemonade or you can try something new like Pomegranate Iced Tea.\nA post shared by Official Lip Smacker (@lipsmackerbrand) on Feb 18, 2017 at 9:05am PST \nEither way, we’re excited this brand still keeps coming out with new flavors, and we’re even more excited to try this oatmeal one.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:44:54.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
