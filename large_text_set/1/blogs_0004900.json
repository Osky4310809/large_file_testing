While the transfer speeds of up to 95MB/s aren’t necessarily new, SanDisk claims that this new card can “manage random read input-output access per second (IOPS) of 1,500 and write IOPS of 500, so it can quickly open apps and process accompanying tasks, such as audio, graphics, saved profiles and in-app permissions.”\nTaking advantage of Google’s <a href=\"http://www.droid-life.com/tag/adoptable-storage/\">Adoptable Storage</a> probably won’t be an issue if you decide to pick up one of these cards.\nThis new A1-rated microSD card from SanDisk will arrive this month for $199.99.\n<h6 style=\"text-align: right;\">Via: <a href=\"https://www.sandisk.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2017/sandisk-unveils-worlds-first-microsd-card-designed-to-deliver-a-new-dimension-of-mobile-application-performance\" target=\"_blank\">SanDisk</a></h6> </div>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T03:13:36.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
