It was halted when a Seattle judge slapped a temporary restraining order on the executive order, which was upheld by a higher court , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n“One of the big differences that you’re going to see in the executive order is that is going to be responsive to the judicial ruling, which didn’t exist previously,” Miller said.\nA panel of appeals court judges attacked the claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism, and ruled that the prohibition did not enhance national security.\nBut Miller continued to sound that argument: “We’ve got a serious problem in our country of terrorism, radicalization and serious problems of people joining ISIS, joining terror groups, joining Al Qaeda and committing or attempting to commit acts of crime and terror against our nation.”\nHe said the new executive order will be coming “very soon.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:52:02.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
