Jones , USA TODAY Published 9:56 a.m. ET March 15, 2017 | Updated 31 minutes ago 8 Shares A post shared by Paris-Michael K. Jackson (@parisjackson) on Mar 14, 2017 at 1:27pm PDT \nParis Jackson got nostalgic for her latest cover story. \nThe multi-hyphenate and daughter of Michael Jackson graces the cover of Harper's Bazaar and, in the 150th-anniversary issue, reflects on life with the King of Pop, whom she knew simply as \" the king of my heart .\" \"When I was a kid, I was with my dad and my two brothers (Prince Michael Jackson II and Michael Joseph Jackson Jr.),\" she explains. \"Growing up, I was treated as the favorite because I was the only girl. I was the princess. I was perfect in my dad’s eyes.\" \nBut that sentiment didn't necessarily translate online, where Jackson was often subject to cyberbullying. \"I've had self-esteem issues for a really, really long time,\" she shared in January. \"Plenty of people think I'm ugly, and plenty of people don't. But there's a moment when I'm modeling where I forget about my self-esteem issues and focus on what the photographer's telling me – and I feel pretty.\" \nThe confidence Jackson has gleaned from being behind the camera comes across in her Harper’s Bazaar cover story, where the star, now comfortable in her skin, shrugs off the critics. \"You’re on their mind — how is that a bad thing?\" she asks. \"Doesn’t matter if they’re saying good or bad things about you. They’re thinking about you enough to write about you. You just can’t care… Not everybody is going to be happy with what you do. If you’re not happy with what you’re doing, that’s a problem. If you’re happy, who gives a (expletive)?\" \nJackson certainly has reason to be happy. In March, she signed a modeling contract joining veteran models like Gisele Bündchen and Karlie Kloss, \"It girls\" like Ashley Graham and Gigi and Bella Hadid and rising stars like Joan Smalls and model/actress Hari Nef at IMG Models \nShe also recently cameoed on Lee Daniels' girl-group drama Star, where she shined as social media guru Rachel Wells. — STAR (@STAR) March 9, 2017 \nAnd with her platform, Jackson has used her voice to speak on out on politics, championing feminism and amplifying the cause of the Dakota Access Pipeline protesters . \n“Plenty of times I’ve thought about not doing anything in the public eye and having my own private life,” she tells Harper's Bazaar . “Then I started seeing how everything in the world is going. And I feel like each year it’s getting worse… I know there are a lot of people who would feel very blessed to be in my position, so I want to use it for important things.” Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2mJfjOv Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T17:14:28.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
