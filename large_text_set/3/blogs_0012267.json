Langel, an attorney who is representingÂ the U.S. women in contract negotiations, balked at that number. \nâThat is so incredibly misleading, and you can quote me on that,â Langel told ESPNW. âThat couples the (U.S. Olympic Committee) money with their (federation) money and assumes the women win gold at the 2018 Olympics. That amount would only apply to the Olympic year. And more than $60,000 of it would come from the USOC.â \nAccording to the players, USA Hockey also spends roughly $3.5 million on a national team development program for men, but thereâs no comparable program for women. \nUSA Hockey says it still plans to field a âcompetitive teamâ if Knight and her teammates follow through on the boycott. \nâGood luck getting a suitable No. 1 competition to represent our country on a world stage,â Knight said. âI kind of dare them.â \nThis article first appeared on NESN.com and was syndicated with permission.
