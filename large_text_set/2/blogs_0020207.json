One of the very first rumored targets was Inter Milan winger Ivan Perisic, though according to the latest update on the situation, Chelsea were hardly alone in the chase for the player, with Liverpool and Manchester United had also supposedly joining the fray. With this much potential interest around, Inter Milan director Piero Ausilio saw it fit to pour cold water on everyoneâ€™s hopes of getting Perisic in the next transfer window . \"I do not think it is either Perisic's or our intentions for him to leave. He is part of a massive project and we do not want to sell our players. We cannot envisage an Inter without Perisic. We are not going to get rid of our best players.\" -Piero Ausilio; source: Gazzetta dello Sport via talkSport With Chinese giants Suning now owning a majority stake in the legendary Italian club and looking to invest in a long-term project, Inter can certainly can afford to hold onto their best players quite effectively. Not that it matters as Perisic would not be an upgrade on our current options, despite his skills and versatility. Missing out on him is not that big of a loss.
