Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nPresident Trump’s budget has been unveiled, and not surprisingly, liberals are not happy at all to see a bump in defense spending and cuts to entrenched programs like the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Trump's budget eliminates arts, public broadcasting spending https://t.co/W2IfRgBzH9 \n— Washington Post (@washingtonpost) March 16, 2017 \nIt’s also no surprise to learn that former CBS News anchor Dan Rather would prefer the good old days, when PBS shared the airwaves with the big three broadcast networks, to his current online gig teaching journalism to anyone willing to put up the $10 tuition fee. Back then, Americans could choose rather easily who would give them their news with the same, distinct liberal slant. \nSpeaking of a liberal slant, the Washington Post’s tweets Thursday certainly do paint a picture of mean-spirited budget cuts. Analysis: Trump’s military spending bump could fund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for the next 121 years https://t.co/vCdRj1CztU \n— Washington Post (@washingtonpost) March 16, 2017 Perspective: Trump’s \"forgotten men and women\"?

Ted Cruz tweets tribute to snowflakes everywhere, breaks Twitter (video) \nWow, we’re all gonna die. Just for the record, we didn’t leave out tweets promoting all or any of the Post’s positive takes on the proposed budget — there are none. \nBut what’s this about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting unifying American culture and making sure all Americans “get access to the same ideas and arguments”? Alyssa Rosenberg writes , after making note of more and more content fleeing behind paywalls ( ahem ): \n… if you want to create a genuine national culture, you actually have to reach all Americans, rather than losing yourself in idiotic and racist delusions about defeating “bad hombres” by force or outbreeding the competition. And you have to create compelling, high-quality content that can persuade Americans across the political spectrum, rather than mediocre trash that preys on audiences who feel under-served by mainstream media. \nThe fact is, people will flock to and watch high quality and compelling content; millions will pay good money to do so. Ken Burns’ Civil War documentary, mentioned in Rosenberg’s piece, is an example of that breakthrough content … but that was 1990. \nAnd “Sesame Street” has moved to HBO after becoming to a large extent an open forum (and image rehab clinic) for liberal celebrities and politicians. Which study showed toddlers were clamoring to have “F*** Donald Trump” rapper Macklemore stop by? \nMaybe we’re being too harsh. Remember all those times America united behind a pledge drive? When we were all one under endless repeats of Yanni and Celtic Woman and Fleetwood Mac concerts? \n— Dark Photon (@DangerBurch) March 16, 2017 @washingtonpost that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:40:57.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
