By Mitchmanley332 Loved this movie. Can't wait to see it again. Jennifer Lawrence is stunning in this movie. Totally worth seeing. Don't listen to the critics. Bunch of idiots.... Passangera By Simon Rosenberg It was amazing. It left me at the edge of the seat. This scientific, kinda romantic film was leaving me breathless. You will not regret seeing it.... Disappointed By moviefan76652 I went in there all fired up to see two of my favorite actors together but found myself struggling to stay awake. The best parts ended up being seeing JL looking sexy as hell. But even that wasn't... Little bit Sci Fi, Little bit love story By yumyumman Much better than expected. Asks the question, If you can't live the life you love can you love the life you live. No plus to the 3D version, however.... Aurora movie goer By burrellp So what can be said about passengers marooned in an intergalactic space ship. I liken it to a two hour episode of star trek Voyager. Great lead actors as well.... By stultz2319374 This is a very entertaining movie. Better than I expected. The critics are wrong. Tomatoes says 31%. Should be more like 75-80. Good. Almost great. Good date movie for sure.... Lots of action great story chemistry perfect By rogerscottgreen Ignore the critics they are way off. If you love a good story so well directed and acted, them go to this one really not a dull moment just super cadence of the story and actors and action. Wow great... Good Movie By Shadowfax0925 PG 13s keep slipping in more sex, nudity and provocative dress where it isn't needed to tell a really great story. I don't go to movies to see bodies. I go for the story. All in all, It was worth... Worked for me By landofar I enjoyed it. It had the action that \"Arrival\" lacked. The costars fit together well and effects were quite good. 350 fans on Fandango give it a 4+ and Rotten Tomatoes rates it at 31%? Something...
