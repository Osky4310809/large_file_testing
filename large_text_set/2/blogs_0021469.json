Nicole is one of the originals, so we felt it was a great fit. What was your initial reaction to ABH wanting to collab with you? Nicole Guerriero: I think I froze when I saw the e-mail from Claudia. I remember just staring at my phone for a good 15 minutes. After that, I'm pretty sure I was running around my house at high speeds screaming. Anastasia has always been my top brand, so to know that they wanted to collaborate with me was a dream come true. Why did you decide to create a new Glow Kit? NG: It was Claudia's idea at first. After we meet, she gave me the option to do whatever product I wanted, but highlighter is my favorite part of my makeup routine. It just made sense to do a Glow Kit. CS: Nicole and I had a sit-down meeting in my office, and we played with a variety of makeup from the development collection. Glow really spoke to her. Nicole was passionate about Glow and knew what colors she loves. What was your favorite Glow Kit prior to this? NG: At first, it was the Gleam Glow Kit because I was super into the shade \"Crushed Pearl\" (Let's be honest I still love it). Then, the Moonchild Glow Kit came out and blew me away. I love Moonchild because the shades in the kit are super unique and just speak to my soul. What was the collaboration process like? CS: To create the shades she wanted, we first narrowed the kit’s vibe, and the majority of work was focused on the process of eliminating tones based on what she did and didn’t like. Tweaks that were made to shades were communicated back and forth by text, as Nicole lives in Florida. I would swatch them on my arm in daylight—much like I test all our makeup—and send her high-resolution images to see what she thought. We spent a lot more time working on the packaging and finding \"Daydream,\" the perfect blush color that isn’t too peachy or too pink. Nicole speaks in color tones, so it was very easy for us to understand each other. She was great with providing feedback, and I loved working with her. NG: It was super chill because Claudia is one of the coolest people on the planet. She was down for whatever I wanted to do. She was there to help lead in me in the right direction, but was totally open to any idea I wanted, which I truly appreciated. Courtesy of brand How did you decide which shades to include? CS: First, we narrowed down the tones that she was looking for, and we looked at the library and cross-referenced shades in order for me to fully understand what Nicole was expressing. NG: We live across the country from each other, so I was in Florida researching every single highlighter shade, texture, and formula I could get my hands on. I have to say my current highlighter collection would put any Sephora store to shame. When we got together, I had what I thought I wanted to be my Glow Kit. After we started messing around with a bunch of different colors that I wouldn't normally go for, we ended up creating six totally different shades than what I originally came with. When we saw all six shades together, we were like, 'Yeah, this is gonna be good.' What are some of your favorite ways to use the new Glow Kit? CS: I use the highlighters as eyeshadow a lot. NG: I use it every single day to, of course, pop my cheekbones and snatch my nose. I also love to use the shades as eyeshadow. When I want to be a little extra glow-y, I'll also use it on my chest and shoulders. Do you have any favorite color combos? NG: My favorite combo at the moment is \"Forever Young\" (a muted pewter) first with \"Forever Lit\" (a pearly white) over top. I love an intense highlighter, and the shade \"Forever Lit\" really gives it to you. Loading View on Instagram Do you have any application tricks? NG: I have a few. You can use these tips together or solo. First, before you apply your highlighter, spray your face with a setting spray to add a little moisture to the skin. This will give the highlighter a little something to stick to. Next, for an intense, Instagram-worthy highlight, spray your brush with setting spray before picking up your highlighter. This will really help the glow pop. Lastly, my favorite trick for after you've applied your highlighter is to spray a damp Beautyblender with—you guessed it—setting spray, and gently dab it over the area. This helps to eliminate any extra powder and gives the skin a beautiful, natural-looking glow that's perfectly blended.\" The Anastasia Beverly Hills Nicole Guerriero Glow Kit will be available exclusively on the Sephora app from Sunday, February 26 to Monday, February 27. It officially launches on anastasiabeverlyhills.com on March 3.
