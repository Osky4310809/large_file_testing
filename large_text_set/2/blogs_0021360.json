I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my crew in Iran, my producer Alexandre Mallet-Guy, Cohen media, Amazon and my fellow nominees in the foreign film category. I’m sorry I’m not with you tonight. My absence is out of respect for the people in my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the US. \nDividing the world into the ‘us’ and ‘our enemies’ categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions. They create empathy between ‘us’ and ‘others,’ an empathy which we need today more than ever. Thank you on behalf of Mr. Farhadi. \nJust before the Oscars telecast, PEOPLE reports Farhadi also addressed 10,000 London protesters via a video link from the city of Tehran who were gathering for a screening of the movie “The Salesman” in solidarity and unity against Trump. http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/test/2017/02/26/2719405896901086068/1024x576_MP4_2719405896901086068.mp4 \nHe said, \nThis solidarity is off to a great start. I hope this movement will continue and spread for it has within itself the power to stand up to fascism, be victorious in the face of extremism and say no to oppressive political powers everywhere. \nThis is Farhadi’s second Oscar win.
