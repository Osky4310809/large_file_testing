Prince Harry: it shows strength to talk about mental health \n\"For surely it cannot be beyond the wit of man to integrate circular economy principles into the heart of business models?\" \nThe Prince's International Sustainability Unit is working to highlight the important role that innovation and design can play in shaping the plastic value chain and reducing the associated environmental impacts. \nHis Business in the Community organisation has formed a Circular Economy Taskforce, which is building a programme of collaborative action and innovation within different sectors.
