I’m just so proud of the girls’ effort today,’’ she said. \n“It means the world to us. This mob, they are so, so dedicated.’’ \nThe clash got the royal seal of approval from two of the biggest names in the game’s history. \nAFL and Melbourne icon Ron Barassi was present at the coin toss while fellow legend and Brisbane board member Leigh Matthews tweeted before the game: “Full credit to AFL, launch of AFLW has been brilliant marketing, the players joy is infectious and the aspirational aspect is a winner’’. \nBrisbane play their second match against Fremantle in WA on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:19:36.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
