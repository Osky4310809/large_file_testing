GETTY Coronal holes appear sporadically on the sun Solar storms: Sun's solar flares light up space Tue, November 29, 2016 A solar flare is an intense burst of radiation coming from the release of magnetic energy associated with sunspots. Flares are our solar system's largest explosive events. They are seen as bright areas on the sun and last from mere minutes to several hours. Play slideshow 1 of 12 \nThis can affect satellites in orbit, potentially leading to a lack of GPS navigation, mobile phone signal and satellite TV such as Sky. \nAdditionally, a surge of particles can lead to high currents in the magnetosphere, which can lead to higher than normal electricity in power lines, resulting in electrical transformers and power stations blow outs and a loss of power. GETTY As the atmosphere expands it can effect satellites A video posted by NASA (@nasa) on Jan 10, 2017 at 6:53am PST \nHowever, the bombardment of solar winds on the Earth will also lead to Northern Lights over the coming days. \nNASA said that the “particle stream will likely generate aurora here on Earth” with auroraforecast.com predicting several natural light shows in the northern hemisphere, typically in the upper reaches of northern Europe, over the coming days.
