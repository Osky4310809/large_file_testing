The NeuroQore team hopes to replace drugs with these pulses and thinks it may be onto something with initial tests. \n“We have an 87.5 percent remission success rate over drug-resistant depression,” co-founder Mehran Talebinjad tells TechCrunch. \nIt’s quite the claim — and the startup is in the very early stages with a very small amount of subjects at the moment — but similar brain wave technology has been around treat mental diseases since the mid-90’s. \nNeurofeedback sprang up a couple a couple decades ago to help with depression, anxiety, ADHD, PTSD, impulse control and a number of different types of addiction. It’s mostly used in social work professions or clinics where drugs are not the primary method of treatment and works by stimulating parts of the brain to send a positive signal whenever a desired mood is achieved. When a desirable brain wave pattern appears, the neurofeedback machine sends a pleasant tone (positive feedback) into the patient’s ears, which hopefully causes the brain to prolong that desirable brainwave pattern. The brain, overtime, is trained to prolong a healthy brain wave pattern permanently. NueroQore works in a slightly different way. Rather than sending pleasant tones through the ears to train the brain, it uses the magnetic pulses to send those tones directly into the brain to create positive feedback on its own. Neuroqore also measures its results with biomarkers as physical evidence. Unlike with talk therapy or drugs, this takes out some of the guesswork on where the brain might be improving. According to NeuroQore and another expert source we asked who uses neurofeedback, there are also no side effects to thes types of therapies. The only issue is this type of therapy may not work for everyone. Talebinjad, who has a degree in biomedical engineering, came up with the idea after performing his first brain surgery. “Neuromodulation is super important and the brain is so complex,” he said. “I realized during this surgery there wasn’t a lot of effective approaches out there.” The next challenge for Talebinjad and his team is getting FDA approval, though he says he does have a line out there. And he hopes to set up brain centers where patients can go and get magnetic stimulation treatment throughout California later this year. \nNeuroQore debuts its technology at biotech accelerator Indiebio’s Demo Day today in downtown San Francisco.
