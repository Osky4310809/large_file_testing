File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) has urged Filipino workers due for deployment abroad to first secure proper medical screening before leaving the country. \nLabor Secretary Silvestre Bello III made the reminder yesterday, after the Jordan Health Ministry deported 400 workers recently due to various health issues. \n“It is imperative for our workers to undergo a thorough medical check-up or screening by Department of Health (DOH)-accredited hospitals and clinics before they leave the country to avoid being deported due to some health restrictions. Some countries abroad are very particular when it comes to health issues,” Bello said in a statement. \nBello cited an advisory released by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) on a Jordan health ministry report from January to November 2016, recording 185 cases of hepatitis B, 149 cases of tuberculosis, and 66 cases of HIV/AIDS among foreign workers. \nThe Jordan health ministry also documented a total of 356,045 guest workers at the directorate for medical check-up, and 457 of them were diagnosed with hepatitis B, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. \nAside from this, some 14,633 Filipino workers have also undergone medical examination, and 35 of them were found to have tuberculosis, while 27 workers are suffering from hepatitis B.
