Now, there are concerns that Chinese tycoon Xiao Jianhua, who has not been seen since last week, has met a similar fate. \nThe first murmur came from overseas. \nMingjing News, a New York-based site that specialises in Chinese politics, reported that an unnamed Chinese billionaire had been arrested in Hong Kong and taken to mainland China last Friday evening by Chinese police and state security officials. \nThe next day, Hong Kong police received a request to investigate the whereabouts of the missing businessman. \nLocal police began their investigation and found that the subject of their enquiry had indeed re-entered mainland China on Friday, the same day he was detained. \nA day later, on 29 January, however, a family member asked the police to close the case, saying the missing person had been in touch and was \"safe\". \nBy Monday, all of Hong Kong was wondering, who was the billionaire? What was his crime? Where was he? And had Chinese agents been operating on Hong Kong soil with impunity? \nUS-based news site Bowen Press soon named the tycoon as Xiao Jianhua, one of China's richest people, with a $6bn (Â£4.8bn) fortune, according to Hurun Report, a ranking of wealthy Chinese people. \nMr Xiao, who is in his mid-40s, was known to have been a student leader at the prestigious Peking University during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. \nHis business ventures were mainly in the financial services sector.

It's business as usual at Tomorrow,\" said the statement. \nThe message seems to contradict the Hong Kong police report that Mr Xiao had returned to China. \nOn Tuesday, the company issued yet another statement, reportedly saying Mr Xiao was a patriot and a Communist Party stalwart. \nIt claimed he had not been kidnapped. \nIn fact, the statement said Mr Xiao, who was born in China, was also a Canadian citizen and a permanent Hong Kong resident, and that he enjoyed the legal protection of both. \nIt promised Mr Xiao would finish his treatment and meet the media soon. \nStrangely though, both statements soon vanished. The company's account on WeChat seemed to be removed. And the company website is currently inaccessible. Image caption Tuesday's statement later came out as a front-page advertisement on Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao on Wednesday \nThe Canadian government has told BBC News that it was aware of the case, and that consular officials were gathering more information. \nWith so many questions and so few answers, rumours are swirling that Mr Xiao's disappearance had something to do China's continuing anti-corruption campaign. \nOr was he possibly involved with a faction in the Chinese government that opposed President Xi Jinping? \nIf he was indeed abducted from Hong Kong, was it a violation of the '\"one country, two systems\" policy that was meant to keep the territory legally separate from China until 2047? \nSo far, there are no answers. \nHong Kong police have said that, despite the request from family members, they are continuing to investigate the case.
