Police confiscated the gun. Mensa spent the night in jail and was released on $35,000 bail. \nBeverly Hills police previously detained Mensa in 2016 and accused the rapper of stealing merchandise from Barneys. Mensa posted about the incident on Snapchat, denying the allegations and accusing the police of racial profiling. \"This should be funny, but really, I got shit to do, man,\" he said. \"It's like, you can't be a young black man out here doing anything â€“ legal, positive, and you still get treated like a criminal.\" \nLast year, Mensa released a seven-track EP, There's Alot Going On , as he continued to prep his long-awaited debut album. The politically charged project featured songs about the Flint water crisis and the police shooting of Chicago teen Laquan McDonald . Mensa also became an activist in his own right, speaking out against police brutality and Donald Trump, and joining the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock .
