Act as one team \nWe work as one integrated team from the start. This includes our clients, who are often involved in regular reviews and standups. We don’t wait to validate feasibility or understand what’s possible. Instead, we integrate business , design, and technology perspectives into projects from day one. \nWe recently created an app for a leading video platform that would not have been possible without this approach. The concept revolved around an innovative color sampling technology that could adjust the color of the UI to match the video in realtime. \nTo test the idea, the team—including the designers and product managers—immediately began prototyping the concept. Doing so let them understand whether color shifts had to be quicker, slower, or timed a certain way. We saved time and validated faster than a process where wireframes and PSDs get handed down the line. It also means that when it comes time to develop it, we know the true design intent. \nBy removing handoffs, there’s none of the usual finger pointing for why something may not have worked. We continually refine it together, as one team, with one shared objective. \nWhich brings me to my second point: Include developers at the onset of every project \nIn many organizations, developers are excluded until it’s time to develop design concepts. \nBut developers can validate designs and uncover technical considerations that might cause trouble down the road (or be an exciting new territory). \nA developer’s insight is essential knowledge for the success of any project. Without this perspective, creative teams risk investing in ideas that can’t be implemented as envisioned. Bringing technology into the design process can uncover new ideas while ensuring concepts get delivered on. \nTo further tighten collaboration, developers and designers don’t sit by discipline. We sit side-by-side by project team. We discuss each other’s work as we go, not just during major reviews. The result is shorter feedback loops and products that are better thought through. Image courtesy of Work & Co. Build an environment of open communication \nDevelopers get involved in early design reviews. Designers keep refining as we build. By breaking down barriers, we create an environment where each team member seeks the feedback and ideas of others. \nAs one of our design partners says, “respect is the ultimate currency.” Our teams have to trust each other , and respect everyone’s opinions. This enables more constructive conversations throughout, and alignment towards the same goal. Image courtesy of Work & Co. Get into the habit of experimenting \nWe want to help our clients take bigger risks and launch more innovative products , but we also have a responsibility to ensure greater likelihood of success. \nWe’ve found that by experimenting at the outset, we can more rapidly identify which strategies will work. We constantly iterate and try new ways to solve problems. As a result, we produce dozens of concepts and prototypes, often within the first few weeks of kicking off. For the video app we conceived, we prototyped over 75 interfaces and interactions before arriving at the final solution. \nThis approach allows us to run highly targeted experiments, whether they be related to UX, technical feasibility, or any other aspect of each product. Put energy into prototyping over presentations \nWe start prototyping as early as week one in a project. Working as one team means we can limit presentations in favor of reviewing in-progress prototypes. We take the time and energy that often gets funneled into presentations, and instead run user tests or get clients to interact with a functioning product. The result? Designers and developers collaborating on the product within the first week, instead of months down the line. On average, we’re delivering at least one prototype within the first month of kicking off a project. \nThe next time you’re ready to kick off a new project, spend some time really evaluating the perspectives and expertise you bring into the process and how talent will work together. Can you minimize handoffs and expand communication outside of formal reviews? \nThe investment in these adjustments will lead to happier, more productive teams—and better digital products.
