This is what shapes the character of people, vibes of a city and indeed the future. \nThey say history shapes the character of cities and people. When you travel this is especially noticeable, if you stay informed, with a keenly observant eye. Then you notice differences even amongst neighbouring peoples, separated by nothing but political lines. \nMy mind presently is a concoction of cultural and historical cocktails — a fortnight on the move and I am left with half a lifetime of mental chewing to do. And, no wonder… Bruges Market Square \nFrom the languorous German University town of Bonn snoozing by the Rhine in vacation time, a three-hour train journey transported us to the capital of vice, drugs and sex – Amsterdam in the Netherlands — where fun never takes vacation! If Bonn wears her 2000 years of history with maturity, Amsterdam doesn’t seem to have outgrown her teen years! This is a city where sex workers don’t mind being ogled at as they gyrate in show windows, and sex shops spill their exotica next to regular tourist shops. Prostitution is legal and drugs accepted, if used discreetly! \nCoffee shops in Amsterdam openly sell cannabis. To add to the merry cocktail, not far from the sex and drugs within the Centrum lies a peaceful, reflective Beguinage –where religious women live in a community without renouncing the world. \nAmsterdam’s checkered history and culture of acceptance has made the city a joyful concoction! Live and let live is the city’s motto. Tulips are but one weak symbol of the vitality the city throbs with. The visions I walked away with are – the crazed genius of Van Gogh, the vulnerable daring of sex workers, Anne Frank’s house, 90 years of eternal seductress Marilyn Monroe, unbelievable Ripley’s museum, and the 100-kms of canals forming concentric rings round the city… Amsterdam is an experience! \nFrom Amsterdam we took a train to Belgium, reaching Brussels, the heart of the European Union and the city of terror, which faced its own terror attack in March 2016 and was the base for the November 2015 Paris terror attacks. \nReaching as it started getting dark, the city seemed scary. Shops were shut and Brussels wore a shroud of darkness and gloom. Where were Brussel’s citizens? After the proudly open windows of Netherlands, the shuttered dark windows cast a feel of gloom. Suddenly the language, smooth technology and helpful attitudes we had taken for granted in Germany and Netherlands gave way, and we couldn’t find anyone to guide us even as internet accessibility became an issue. \nThe city reflects her history as a political mess that has historically undergone many fragmentations – densely populated by immigrants who have not merged into the fabric of the city – unlike Amsterdam. \nThe gothic feel continued till we visited the City Centre where the people’s need to fight back is reflected in a proliferation of French restaurants, the overflow of Delirium and other Belgian beer, the tantalizing smell of waffles and melted Belgian chocolate leading to The Grand Place, the city’s main square — an enchanting landmark surrounded by opulent buildings. \nBrussels had been resurrected in our eyes – somewhat. Till the beggars littering the lanes and the subway, and a near-attack by an urchin brought back the uneasy fear… \nNext morning came magical Bruges. Just one hour from Brussels but you could be in another world! Similar to Amsterdam – and yet so different! Both cities with canals are called ‘Venice of the North’. Both have beguinages and are essentially tourist cities. \nBut if Amsterdam is a carnival, Bruges is a fairytale! A quiet magical town with elements of romance – flowing waters, horse-drawn carriages, beautiful old buildings, good food and a quiet life. You can walk across the town in 45 minutes, or linger at every nook and savor the magic. \nThe City Square boasts uniquely preserved buildings dating back centuries. A gem that ruled as the richest European city, then became the poorest and now shines again! Bruges’ history of art and culture never gave way and keeps it throbbing elegantly even today! \nWe return pleased and reflective. How can anyone separate history and a city from her people? An impossible task… We become what our history shapes us into! And the history we contribute to today is what will shape the future…   Vinita Dawra Nangia Vinita Dawra Nangia is a Senior Editor with The Times of India.
