He also recognized his widow Carryn, who received an extended standing ovation from the audience. \"We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William 'Ryan' Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero –- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation,\" President Trump said. \"Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom –- we will never forget him.\" As the room focused on her, Carryn looked toward the ceiling and said through tears, \"I love you.\" It was no doubt the most powerful moment of the night. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom –- we will never forget him. Heartbreaking moment! pic.twitter.com/8qsgIfQePB — The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) March 1, 2017 Owens was killed in a raid in January when special forces operatives targeted an Al Qaeda strong hold in Yemen. According to the Defense Department, crucial intelligence was gathered during the raid that will help prevent future attacks. \"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies,\" Secretary of Defense General Mattis said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T05:57:49.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
