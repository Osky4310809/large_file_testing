Video by Jose Villegas, produced by Sue Morrow The Sacramento Bee The emergency spillway at Lake Oroville shows signs of damage from the water flows that overtopped the structure this weekend for the first time in the dam’s history.

Jose Luis Villegas jvillegas@sacbee.com 1 of 3 i \nBy Phillip Reese, Ryan Sabalow and Dale Kasler \nAs massive releases of water pummeled its surface all night Sunday and all day Monday, the main spillway at Oroville Dam showed no new signs of erosion, reducing the chances of a catastrophic collapse that would flood vast expanses of Butte, Yuba and Sutter counties, state officials said. \nBut serious threats remain. A new storm is brewing. Officials are frantically releasing water from Lake Oroville to keep levels below the emergency spillway. And no one can guarantee that crippling erosion on the dam’s emergency and main spillways won’t once again threaten tens of thousands of homes and businesses downstream. \nIn addition, state officials are unable to answer key questions: Why did the emergency spillway – the dam’s safety valve – approach the brink of failure when handling flows that should have been a minor strain? Why did state officials state with confidence Sunday afternoon that the situation had stabilized and the emergency spillway would hold, only to predict its failure and order the evacuation of nearly 200,000 people a few hours later? \n“How can they assure us that it’s safe?” asked Maribel Cervantes, 35, of Yuba City as she sat in a Yolo County evacuation shelter on Monday. “How can we be 100 percent sure when one minute they’re saying the spillway was about to collapse?” \nThe engineering crisis facing Oroville Dam – and repeated swings in strategy – started last week, when Department of Water Resources engineers discovered a cavernous hole in the lower section of the dam’s main spillway following a series of strong storms. The main spillway, a 3,000-foot concrete span with gate controls, acts as the dam’s primary flood-control outlet during California’s rainy season. \nFearing the spillway would further erode and become inoperable, dam operators stopped the flows, then gradually and cautiously reactivated releases. With stormwater and runoff from the snow-packed Sierra still rushing in, the lake climbed to the point that water threatened to overtop the emergency spillway adjacent to the damaged main spillway for the first time in the dam’s 48-year history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:02:27.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
