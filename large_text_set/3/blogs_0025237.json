Am I alone in viewing media coverage of Westminster murderer as disproportionate? Not entirely because @simonjenkins4 was right about BBC — Roy Greenslade (@GreensladeR) March 24, 2017 \nHe said it was a \"very sensible thing to do and I applaud them for it,\" and added that British outlets should consider doing the same. \nRoy Greenslade, former editor of the Daily Mirror and a professor of journalism, disagreed that media outlets should stop publishing photos and names of assailants, but seconded that the \"the wall-to-wall\" coverage of the London attack had been \"over the top\" and aids ISIS. \n\"The point of terrorists is to create terror,\" he said. \"That is the definition of terrorism.\" \nWhen the British press give undue publicity to a supposed act of terrorism, it helps play into the hands of those who seek to intimate. \n\"ISIS do nothing and yet they reap the rewards of being able to bring terror to a capital on the other side of the world,\" he said. \nGreenslade said it was important to publish names and photos because it helps the authorities to gather information on assailants, adding that he didn't think the French decision was comparable. \n\"I'm not saying we shouldn't cover it, but we didn't get it in proportion,\" he added.
