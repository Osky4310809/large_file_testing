X-23, played by Dafne Keene. While this is X-23’s cinematic debut, the character has a much longer history in the Marvel Comics universe and in origin in the X-Men: Evolution animated series. \nIt was Craig Kyle who created X-23 for X-Men: Evolution after turning down a request to make Wolverine one of the teenage students at the show’s version of the Xavier Institute. The character was well liked enough to make the jump to the Marvel Comics universe. Kyle wrote her origin story in the X-23: Innocence Lost and continued her story in the sequel, X-23: Target X . \nNow that Laura has won over the hearts of many moviegoers, Kyle has some ideas about what an X-23 spinoff movie could be like. Much like Logan , it involves its a dark road trip tale with a hint of redemption. \n“ We know the kids were created and tested,” Kyle tells the Hollywood Reporter. “I'd love to see some of the stories that we told [in the comics], see as much as we can of how she came to be, but then really get into the stories of what she was forced to do and commit. She said she killed people. She said bad people. The bulk of who X-23 and Laura killed in the comic books were bad people, but she did kill some children. She did kill a whole press corps. I think there's something powerful about watching her go through those horrors without any say and without any ability to not take those actions. \n“ A story I always wanted to tell was, once she's free and once she's gone through what she's gone through, the only way she can have a hope for a future is for her to go back and trace the lives that remained and were harmed by the actions she was forced to commit,” Kyle continues. “You put her on this journey of redemption. She faces the families that lost fathers. The orphans, everyone that was touched by her horrific acts. And she can go through them one by one and face everyone affected by the murders she was forced to commit, if she can get to the end of that road without being killed by those that remain, there's something on the other side of that. I think it would truly be transformative for the character.” \nLogan is the biggest box-office opening of the year so far, and currently has an 88.55 ComicBook Composite score, the second-highest ComicBook Composite score of any comic book movie , and a 4.74 out of 5 user rating, making it the top rated of all comic book movies among ComicBook.com readers .
