The houses are rising from a narrow ribbon of land—which measures 60 feet wide—from Torrance Boulevard to 223rd Street, says the newspaper.\nThe project, called Pacific Bougainvillea, will offer three-, four- and five-bedroom houses priced from $750,000. According to the development’s website , the houses will measure between about 1,900 and 2,800 square feet. They have “virtually” no backyards, but they do sit on spacious lots ranging from 4,500 to 5,000 square feet, says the Breeze .\nApproved more than a decade ago in 2000, the project stalled with the economic downturn, when the original developer went bust. A second developer was also unable to finish the project. \nThe current developer, Newport Beach-based Pacific Communities, is planning a grand opening next month, but four of the new houses were already offered for sale at an open house on Saturday.\nSales rep Deborah Rogers told the Breeze that it’s unusual to see a new detached home in the South Bay sell for under $1 million. She said she expects the whole development to sell out in 18 months.\nThat’s impressive, considering that homebuyers would “essentially would live on a glorified median with virtually no backyards that back onto busy Normandie,” but it speaks to the demand in the area for detached homes at this price point, says the Breeze .\nSouth Bay housing development built on highway median finally selling homes [Daily Breeze] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:48:29.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
