Run through collecting coins in authentic Mario levels reimagined for mobile. Nintendo \nThe wildly popular Super Mario Run smartphone game is now available for play on Android devices, Nintendo said Wednesday. \nNintendo said in a tweet that it made the game available for download at the Google Play store a little earlier than it expected. \nThe release comes about three months after Super Mario Run, Nintendo's first-ever smartphone game, was launched on iOS in December. The game was an instant hit with Apple device users, racking up 40 million downloads in its first four days to become the fastest-selling iOS game in the history of the App Store. \nThe game lets users navigate Mario the plumber through a variety of familiar-looking levels, grabbing as many coins and power-ups as possible along the way. The game is free to download, but players who want to progress beyond the third level will have to pay $10 (that's Â£7.99 in the UK or AU$15 in Australia) to unlock the rest of the game. \nDoes the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care. \nTech Enabled : CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.
