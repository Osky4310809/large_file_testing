In an interview to Tellychakkar, the Shakti – Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki actress said,” One should carry attitude that no one should dare to stare at you. Never take nonsense from stalkers. If they misbehave, slap them hard. Don’t be abla nari. Look at me; how strong headed I am. People never dare to misbehave with me.” Well, we can’t help but agree with her. A lot of celebrities have spoken up about women being strong and giving it back to eve-teasers and stalkers. \nIn fact, Akshay Kumar also started an initiative where girls are being taught martial arts so they can defend themselves. The actress also opened up about being judged in the society just because she is a divorcee. She says,” Society makes life difficult for single mothers. Even if a mother and daughter are happy in life, people still have problems with that. After doing such good roles on TV, at the end people still judge you because you are a divorcee.” (ALSO READ: Kamya Punjabi remembers bestie late Pratyusha Banerjee on the New Year with this heart wrenching post ) \nThe actress also clarifies that she has no plans of getting married in the future,” I like to live life in present and I haven’t thought about getting married again.” Kamya is currently seen on Shakti – Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki as Preeto and had earlier spoken about how much she has changed after being a part of the show.
