The rest of football tend to laugh at the Arsenal soap opera which is played out on Twitter and Arsenal Fan TV. \nTo be fair, it is brilliant entertainment. Everyone is entitled to a view. Except that the Arsenal fans seem so wrapped up in their anger and despair that they miss the fact that other fans are ridiculing them. \nIt used to be played out in a pub with mates. Now it’s on social media and, without doubt, Arsenal’s latte sipping classes and spoilt little rich kids seem to shout loudest.

All they need is to get Bill Murray to play Arsene Wenger. \nAnother season flirting with the title race, all over by February. The chase is on for the top four and heading for the exit door in the Champions League at last 16 stage. \nSound familiar? Yes. Because it happens most seasons. And it is hard to know whether Arsenal can kick on under Wenger and win the title again. \nThe counter argument is that they have finished in the top four under Wenger for 20 years, won trophies and that should not be dismissed as an easy achievement. There is no guarantee his successor will be better. Eddie Howe or Jurgen Klopp did not fare much better on Saturday.

A new deal is on the table and Wenger is even involved in planning for their pre-season and contract negotiations for the likes of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez. \nBut there is only so much anyone can take. Sat up in the stands with the Chelsea fans, Wenger took stick but far more hurtful was that he could see the game slipping away and his team unable to compete. \nTV pundit Gary Neville was highly critical of Wenger substituting Francis Coquelin, perhaps unaware the French midfielder went into the game nursing a hamstring. Another midfield injury to worry about. \nWenger is painfully loyal to players, arguably to his own detriment. Wenger blamed missing out on N’Golo Kante because Chelsea could pay more. It is more likely the reality is that he did not want to block Coquelin’s progress.
