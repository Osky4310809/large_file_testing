(Photo: Getty; REUTERS) Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nThere's a reason Chelsea were so poor last season despite having won the title a year earlier. \nThere’s a reason the same can be said of Leicester this time out and why Arsenal, year after year, are simply happy enough to finish in the top four. \nIt’s because players aren’t worried about creating legacies anymore. \nThey’re just happy to move on from club to club knowing that another hefty pay cheque is just around the corner come what may. \nManagers of old would demand that players didn’t just win the title once, that they went on and won it three, four and five times to stamp their greatness on the game. \nA bit like Usain Bolt and Mo Farah have done over the years, they weren’t just content to reach the top of the sport, they wanted to climb the mountain again and again. Jose Mourinho speaks with Eden Hazard before the then-Chelsea manager was sacked (Photo: Getty) \nThese days footballers aren’t bothered about that, because the money outweighs the glory. \nAnd since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement I haven’t seen one manager who looks like reinstalling those old values or that mentality in his troops. \nTake Eden Hazard for example: he was going to be the next Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo two years ago. \nBut he got a little bit of criticism from Jose Mourinho so he chucked it in. \nNo loyalty to Mourinho for helping make him a champion, or to Chelsea’s fans — he was happy to go missing and to hell with the consequences. \nHe’s not alone, either — it’s the way of the modern game and I don’t think there are many players in the Premier League, save for the few who play for the clubs they grew up supporting, or who have been with their clubs for five or six years already, who would know anything about loyalty. Wayne Rooney was close to joining Manchester City (Photo: Manchester United) \nLook at Wayne Rooney. He’d have been a Manchester City player a few years ago had he not been concerned about a group of hoodie-wearing United supporters turning up outside his house. \nYet now he’s taking the accolade as United’s record goalscorer. \nThere isn’t enough pressure put on players by supporters, managers and coaches these days, and that’s largely because they can’t do it. \nIf you start digging into them they rarely respond by saying, ‘You’re right and I’m going to show everyone that I really am a club legend and deserve to be seen as one’. \nThey just get their agent to say, “If you’re having a go at my player we’ll be off to Real Madrid, AC Milan or Juventus, thank you very much.” Dimitri Payet ditched West Ham for Marseille (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nDimitri Payet had one good season then decided he owed West Ham’s fans, owners and boss Slaven Bilic absolutely nothing. \nAnd look at Riyad Mahrez, he knows he can have a honker of a season this time out and someone will take him after he helped Leicester win the Premier League last year. \nA Paris Saint-Germain, a Marseille, somewhere in France there’s a team with big bucks who will offer him an escape no matter how poor he has been. \nPlayer loyalty is almost zero these days and invariably it’s their managers who suffer because of that.
