Credit Daniel Arnold for The New York Times Publish Date March 10, 2017 Daniel Arnold has a fascination with midtown Manhattan — “It’s kind of a time capsule of New York,” he said — and that’s where most of these photos were taken, between November and January. A photographer with over 135,000 followers on Instagram , Mr. Arnold is known for finding humor in everyday New York moments, like people standing around eating hot dogs or dogs pulling on their walkers. In this case, he was also looking for the lively and eccentric style found on the city’s wintry streets. He walked us through the moments he captured below.

He does this sort of guttural, beautiful throaty vocal thing accompanied by drums and it doesn’t even matter what he’s singing, he makes such a beautiful sound. I can’t really do him justice with words but there’s something very unique and powerful and otherworldly about his particular performance. It’s definitely a crowd stopper. And he’s got a look to match.” Image Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street. Credit Daniel Arnold for The New York Times “This is a classic thing that has been catching my eye for as long as I’ve been taking photos: A quiet, private moment happening in a loud public space.” Image Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street.

I followed them for a while.” Video \"I actually saw him a couple of days before I took this picture,\" said Mr. Arnold. Credit Daniel Arnold for The New York Times Publish Date March 10, 2017 “This guy walks so fast and so hard that you can’t believe it. I followed him from Houston to 14th Street and it took about 8 minutes. He caught my eye because he’s dressed to kill ...everything about him from his look to his walk ... it says ‘business.’” Image Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street. Credit Daniel Arnold for The New York Times “I saw her coming half a block away. She was taken aback. It’s one thing to have your picture taken, but to have somebody dive low and just shoot your legs? She needed an explanation. ‘What are you doing? What are you doing?’ I told her, ‘You’re wearing rubber leopard shoes. I need to remember this.’ I will say that New York looks best in the rain and the cold.” Image In Central Park South. Credit Daniel Arnold for The New York Times “I love these three dolled up, dressed-to-the-nines, elegant midtown ladies who are cramming hot dogs. It’s just the perfect midtown experience, for my money.” Image Broadway and 23rd Street. Credit Daniel Arnold for The New York Times “This is another thing that always catches my eye in New York: the struggle between people and their pets. The contrast between her dress and her dealing with the minutiae of a dog that won’t cooperate was immediately a funny contrast to me. She seemed so in command of her appearance and her interaction with the world and she’s being dragged back by a dog.” Image Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street. Credit Daniel Arnold for The New York Times “I did take this photo strictly because of this woman’s fashion, which is such a midtown power combo. A woman in a shiny pinstripe suit, you can see her ring and then that beautiful head scarf. She’s just such a character. You don’t even need to see her face. I think you get an idea of her face just from looking at her back.” Image Looking east on 42nd Street. Credit Daniel Arnold for The New York Times “This was the middle of the day right around Grand Central. Everybody around was looking real dingy and work-weary and here comes this woman in four-inch stiletto heels and a fur coat with probably 50 gold balloons. I actually did end up talking to her, she was on her way to a birthday party and spent some time posing for her boyfriend after I caught her crossing the street.” Video I had stopped into Color House to drop off my last roles of film for this project and I walk out the door and what do I see, but this woman sprinting down the block with a guitar as a handbag. Credit Daniel Arnold for The New York Times Publish Date March 10, 2017 “This is one of those [photos] where I had to pull it off so quickly and I was so unprepared that I didn’t know that it was going to work and I was very happy to see that it did. It's kind of the main agony and pleasure of the whole experience. There are plenty of times where things appear in the photo that I never saw in real life, that are just too good to be true and that’s the best. That makes the whole thing worth it.” What's Next", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T03:52:27.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
