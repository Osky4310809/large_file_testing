In fact, Cuban suspects that Trump's plan to bring manufacturing back to the US will backfire and lead to overall job loss. Automation is going to cause unemployment and we need to prepare for it. https://t.co/YEp5txG9aP \n-- Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 20, 2017 \nIn an interview with CNBC on Friday, Cuban said , \"[Trump] is completely unaware of how technology works.\" \nTrump has blamed America's manufacturing losses on trade agreements, taxes, and regulatory issues that sent work overseas. However, we can't just bring last century's factories back to the US and expect prosperity. Humans aren't the best candidate for the job anymore, especially if we're talking about making physical things. \nFor an increasing number of jobs, robots are stronger, faster, more precise, and the most reliable. Cuban pointed out that new factories will likely be heavily automated. He explained: I'm willing to bet that any of these companies that are building new manufacturing plants . . . are going to end up leading to fewer people being employed. That those companies that are building these new plants -- they're not going to end up having more employees in two or three or four years. They're going to end up having less. And there's nothing President Trump can do to stop that because trends in technology -- machine learning, neural networks, deep learning, etc. -- [are] changing the nature of work. \nSo, if it takes fewer employees to get work done, then how should we deal with this disruption? Last week tech moguls and legislators around the world weighed in on the dilemma. ces 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:50:44.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
