Jonny Bush ID: 10561357 “I’m very happy living in my van, I think it’s the best decision I ever made,” says Bush. “The best part is not being tied to be somewhere. I have real estate and I have the opportunity to move it, it’s brilliant. I have a cracking wood-burning stove, I can get it to 30 degrees in here when it can be zero degrees outside. The only downside is having to sometimes defrost my hot water bottle before I go to bed.\n\n“I’ve lived in London, I know how expensive it is but I also know how resourceful I can be, and I can live very frugally. I wouldn’t recommend living in a van to everyone, but some people are capable of doing so.”\nView this image › \nJames Clarke for BuzzFeed News \nID: 10561325 View this image › \nJames Clarke for BuzzFeed News \nID: 10496376 Bush says Canterbury council has introduced planning permission measures that some say are designed to restrict student housing. “I am on the wrong side of legislative law and planning. But I am going through a process with the university in getting formal permission to be parked on campus.”\nHe says his situation has seen the university flag him as a “cause for concern”. “Pity is not what you want, because I’m actually doing quite OK. Acceptance is more important than concern.”\nView this image › \nJames Clarke for BuzzFeed News \nID: 10496379 Bush is in his final year at university. “I could stay in my van indefinitely, but that won’t be the answer for me. To solve the housing crisis you could easily use green spaces – all you’ve got to do is bring in a shipping container with a toilet in it. There’s the viable solution.”\nJames, Mira, and Sam, live and work in shipping containers and caravans in a yard in East Sussex View this image › \nJames and Mira.

We’ve got the end of his yard and we’ve built a world out of shipping containers.”\nView this image › \nEmma Gutteridge for BuzzFeed News \nID: 10496593 They live there with the landowner and other colleagues in caravans and containers, and also use the space to build steel sculptures, interactive art, and jewellery for clients such as festivals and cocktail bars. The trio haven’t sought planning permission for their homes.\nView this image › \nEmma Gutteridge for BuzzFeed News \nID: 10496646 James and Mira, who are a couple, live in a shipping container combined with part of a greenhouse to make a lean-to structure, with a plastic corrugated roof that lets light into their kitchen. They call it their “little test house”. When the group rented on the traditional market, they were paying around £3,000 a month together for an apartment/work studio. Now they pay around a third of that to their landlord.\nView this image › \nMira making jewellery (left) and adding a log to the wood-burner (right).

He explains how their unusual living arrangements came about: “Early on [the company] realised that we could either rent a flat or rent a space for us to build art, but we could not afford both.” In 2011 they created their first hybrid space, before later moving to the yard.\n“The best thing about the yard is the freedom and not doing what everyone else does, with the normal bills and pressures,” Sam says. “And being out in the middle of nowhere when you’re working is useful in terms of headspace.”\n\nView this image › \nEmma Gutteridge for BuzzFeed News \nID: 10561458 View this image › \nEmma Gutteridge \nID: 10496636 They believe that if the councils were willing to be more flexible with rules on planning permission then their way of living could be more popular. “There’s vehicles and containers all over the place that would suit temporary accommodation,” says James. “It’s just about councils lightening up a bit. A lot of people are doing it. We work a lot in the events world and 80% of the people [do it].”\nView this image › \nJames in his workshop in The Yard. Emma Gutteridge \nID: 10496668 “People get oddly selfish over other people coming into the neighbourhood, [and] people will report them,” says Sam. “People associate this kind of living with a group of people appearing in a field somewhere and trashing the place. … There’s plenty of space for us. It could be welcomed, rather than people doing this clandestinely.”\nSee more photos from The Yard in the gallery below. \n\n+2 Emma Gutteridge ID: 10496650 Mark Burton, supplies “tiny houses” to the UK View this image › \nTiny Houses \nID: 10483166 Mark Burton supplies the UK with “ tiny houses ”: wooden “micro home” cabins that start at £6,000 and are a fraction of the price of a bricks-and-mortar building. The homes are insulated and can be fitted with amenities like a kitchen, shower room, and toilet. According to his website, they offer “a bit more living space or temporary accommodation … for a teenager, a spare bedroom for family or friends, a bit of extra B&B space”.\nBut, as Burton admits, the housing crisis is pushing some people to look to these miniature homes as permanent solutions to the unaffordable buying and rental market: “People want to either rent a piece of land on a farm or buy a small piece of woodland and have a tiny house and live in it, but the councils would not allow anything like that.\n“I know people who have done this and are living under the radar of the council, who wouldn’t want to be named.”\nView this image › \nBluebell woods Tiny Houses \nID: 10481465 View this image › \nThe interior of a tiny house. Tiny Houses \nID: 10483158 Burton says: “People who are renting have no choice, and the landlords are sticking rents up and taking full advantage of that. This is particularly so for the younger generation, which I think is wrong.\n“Parents building a tiny house for their adult children in the garden is quite a popular thing to do, because people can’t necessarily afford to move [out] because of house prices.\n“I think the government could do more to help, to make it a bit easier for them. Most people who go to university come away with £40,000 of debt before they’ve even started working – that’s an absolute nightmare.”\nMembers of Steward Community Woodland, live on private woodland in Dartmoor View this image › \nSonia Parsons with her daughters Daisy, 17, Asha, 13, and friend Emerald Worsley, 13, at Steward Woodland Community. James Dadzitis / SWNS \nID: 10496724 Steward Community Woodland is a group of around 20 people who live on a 32-acre area of woodland in Dartmoor that they have owned since 2000, with low-impact sustainable living at the heart of their lifestyle. Their homes are timber-framed buildings on a sloping valley, are mostly made out of material from the woodland, and are either canvas-covered or timber-clad. Some of the members have part-time jobs – such as teaching assistant or photographer – but most of their time is spent managing the woodland and building utilities and tools such as homemade stoves, willow baskets, and wooden spoons.\nView this image › \nJames Dadzitis / SWNS \nID: 10496730 View this image › \nSonia “Sonny” Parsons and Daniel Thompson-Mills at Steward Community Woodland. James Dadzitis / SWNS \nID: 10560823 “We’re here because we don’t want to be living in houses,” said one of the founders, Daniel Thompson-Mills, 48. “We want to live a lifestyle that is nature-connected and that is softer on our impact on the environment. If you’re in a house, you’re either paying commercial rent, which is a bonkers amount of money in my view, or you’re paying a mortgage. How can you be expected to pay that?”\nView this image › \nJames Dadzitis / SWNS \nID: 10560880 But the Dartmoor National Park Authority has refused to give the site planning permission, and dismissed the group’s appeal against its ruling in August 2016. It claims the community has a “harmful” impact on the appearance and wildlife of the area, which the woodland dwellers dispute, saying they have in fact increased biodiversity on the plot. They are facing an eviction deadline of 2 December 2017 unless the decision is changed.\nThey pay council tax but strive to be as self-sustainable as possible, growing their own food and producing their own power through hydroelectricity in the winter and solar power in the summer. “The housing crisis has been brought about by the crap economic system that we’re in,” said Thompson-Mills. “It’s not creating housing that people are actually able to afford, that is environmentally friendly.\n“Our low-impact living is quite extreme and won’t be attractive to most people. What we [people in the UK] need the most of is co-housing projects, where you share utilities, like a kitchen and laundry facilities.”\nView this image › \nMel Davis with her son Ash, 13, at their home in Steward Woodland Community.

He bought the vehicle on eBay for £800 and spent a further £1,000 making it habitable with a bed, storage, and a wood-burner.\nView this image › \nThomas Maddick / SWNS for BuzzFeed News \nID: 10498416 “I don’t want to spend all of my life working to pay for a house that is going to be stuck in one place, possibly with neighbours that I don’t like,” Coward said. “I don’t want all that hassle. Most people spend 25 years of their life paying for a mortgage. That’s a long time. I live my life – if I earn £500 in one week, then I spend £500, spending on what I want.”\nCoward values his freedom, which enabled him to make a spontaneous trip to Loch Lomond in Scotland for Christmas last year. “The best part is waking up every morning and having a different view out the door. In the summertime I like to park up and watch the sunset, have a barbecue outside… I don’t get cold. My dog is a good little hot water bottle for when it’s cold in the night.”\nVideo available at: https://video-cdn.buzzfeed.com/23874/mp4_1920X1080/1487083691 . Thomas Maddick / SWNS for BuzzFeed News \nID: 10549697 The biggest downside is not having running water – Coward carries up to three gallons of water at any time, which can last him a week. He finds this a compromise worth making: “This is my life. I do not want to change it.\n“I hope I’ll live in my ambulance forever, or until it breaks. I’ve got no plans to get a house. I haven’t got a girlfriend at the moment. … The way I look at it, if I meet a girl and she doesn’t want to come live in the van, then she isn’t going to be my girlfriend.”\n\nView this image › \nThomas Maddick / SWNS for BuzzFeed News \nID: 10498422", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:53:49.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
