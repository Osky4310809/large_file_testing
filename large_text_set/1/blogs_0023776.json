I know they show you certain things, the juicy stuff, but Carly was the person that was every day, not necessarily having a drink, but we would always find a moment to talk.” PHOTOS: 'Bachelor' and 'Bachelorette' Engagement Rings Through the Years \nSo who will replace Paradise ’s breakout star? Perhaps Bachelor’s villain Corinne Olympios will volunteer her unwavering nanny, Raquel . Adds Iaconetti, “I feel like they need another sidekick character. And that will be Nanny Raquel!” \nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. ABC has not yet announced a premiere date for Paradise season 4. \nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!
