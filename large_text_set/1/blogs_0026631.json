Todd, who began his career working on former Iowa senator Tom Harkin's DOA presidential campaign, has been a Democrat shill for his entire career, and in fact may be the most visible symbol of what the late Andrew Breitbart famously called the Democrat-Media Complex.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/election/2017/01/30/chuck-todd-admits-media-treated-hillary-with-kid-gloves/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chuck-todd/", "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/27/nbcs-chuck-todd-media-knew-how-hated-hillary-was-h/"], "published": "2017-01-30T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T05:53:44.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
