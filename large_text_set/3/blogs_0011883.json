Photo: Duncan Sinfield \nApple is set to move into its new spaceship campus next month, but based on the latest drone video of the construction site, there’s still a lot of work left to do. \nThe grounds of Apple Park are still littered with construction crews working on everything from landscaping to solar panels. Tim’s big beautiful pile of dirt has been spread throughout the site and some new trees are finally being planted. \nCheck it out: \nApple announced last month that the Apple Park campus will open in April . An exact date wasn’t given. Judging by the looks of the campus though it might not be until the end of the month. Once opened, Tim Cook and 12,000 other Apple employees will work out of the new building that is one of the most environmentally friendly corporate offices ever.\nRecent rumors have claimed that Apple will host an iPad event in April. The new Steve Jobs theater has been pegged as a likely spot for the unveiling, but it unclear if the campus will be ready in time for a big event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T17:39:51.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
