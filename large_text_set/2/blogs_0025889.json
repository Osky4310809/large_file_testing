Government cuts? Tuition fees? The progressive dumbing down of today's culture? Well, all that – and the UK Border Agency officials at Heathrow. \nKristin Ostling , cellist with the Carpe Diem Quartet, who reside at the University of Ohio, was questioned for eight hours by officials at Terminal 3 over the weekend, refused entry to the country, forced to sign written statements, and sent back on a plane to Chicago. The reason? Her performance at the University of Leeds's two-day \"non-nationalist\" Russian opera conference – for which she was receiving no fee, and no expenses, either – was deemed to be \"work\", and she was therefore not allowed in on her visa. The extraordinary thing is that the three other members of the quartet were allowed through and are now in Leeds, so it seems that Ostling was unlucky only because of the size of her instrument. Violins or violas can slip under the beady eyes of our immigration officials, but cellists need to watch out. \nThere's a bigger issue for anyone planning to come to Britain as an academic musician. The rules for academics from outside the EU travelling to the UK to participate in university conferences are clear: giving a spoken lecture is allowed by Border Agency rules, as is the payment of living and accommodation expenses, providing you're not receiving a fee. But not, apparently, if you play an instrument – especially a big, obvious instrument like a cello. (Guitarists, like violinists, report fewer problems with immigration officials.) \nDerek Scott, head of the School of Music at the University of Leeds, spoke to the gatekeepers of Terminal 3 to find out more, and was told that the problem wasn't the conference, but Ostling's cello. Apparently, for immigration officials at Heathrow, to have an instrument automatically means you are working – whether or not you are paid. And, in a bureaucratic conclusion straight out of Kafka, Scott was also informed that what he should have done before inviting the quartet from Ohio was find out if any British or EU-based quartet would also have been prepared to play the music by Sergey Taneyev the Carpe Diems were scheduled to perform – for free. \nThings are bad enough for our universities – and their attempts to work with the best academics from all over the world – already, but the precedent this sets is a nightmare for anyone travelling to this country as a musical performer. Theoretically, if you're coming to visit an academic institution in any capacity from outside the EU, and you're carrying a musical instrument, you face the prospect of being sent home. There is nothing in the Border Agency rules that exempts musicians from the general guidelines for academics. The problem is in their interpretation. The agency must make it clear to all of their airport staff that just because you're travelling to a British university with a musical instrument, you're not – almost definitely not – an illegal economic migrant. If things don't change, performing musicians and musicologists aren't going to risk travelling from the US and elsewhere, our universities are going to be scared to ask them, and music students in the UK will suffer. \nThere is another way, of course. Perhaps it's time for cellists (and musicologists) to plot the end of global capitalism through the medium of lecture recitals from Chicago to Liverpool, Los Angeles to London.
