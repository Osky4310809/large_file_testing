Jamaica’s Usain Bolt poses on the podium with his gold medal \n“I can’t allow that to deter me from my focus this season, so I am focused, but I am not pleased about the situation,” Bolt told the newspaper. \nThe loss of the relay gold deprives Bolt of one of his “triple triples”— he won gold in the 100m, 200m and the 4x100m at Beijing and repeated the unprecedented feat in London in 2012 and again in Rio last year. \n“I think I’ve still accomplished a lot. This hasn’t changed what I have done throughout my career. I have worked hard and pushed and done things that no one has done before. I have won three gold medals over the 100m and 200m, which no one has ever done before.” \nWhen it comes to fighting the doping charge, Bolt said he is willing to put his money behind Carter’s appeal if necessary, a pitch to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \n“That’s up to my management. There are a lot of variables,” Bolt said. “So we will discuss that and see where we go from there, but if it’s necessary (I will help).” Tony", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T02:05:52.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
