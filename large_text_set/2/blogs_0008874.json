But before she knew it, the thunderous sound of a tornado came barreling right towards the metal camper her office was housed in. Thankfully, though, Stockfelt used quick thinking and gut instincts and leaped into action. \nIn an interview with TODAY, Stockfelt said, “All I could think of was to put my daughter back in her car seat, to strap her in. I shoved her underneath my work desk and I got underneath with her.” \nStockfelt, her 2-month-old daughter Autumn, and a co-worker, all crammed together underneath a desk hoping to stay safe. What happened next was stunning. \nAs Stockfelt told TODAY: “We heard the trailer ripping apart, it flipped over backward and it exploded … it was like the trailer just broke into a million pieces and then the tornado sucked us up.” \nDuring the chaos of the storm, she had looped her arm under the handle of the car seat and refused to let go. \n“I have no clue how I was able to hang on to that car seat but I did, because she was above my head,” Stockfelt said, as she described how the wind had sucked the car seat up above her head while she held on as tight as she could. The winds were so strong they pulled her sneakers off her feet.
