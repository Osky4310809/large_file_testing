By Jeffrey Matulef Published 13/01/2017 \nNintendo has revealed its first major Mario adventure for Nintendo Switch, Super Mario Odyssey. \nDue this \"holiday season\", Super Mario Odyssey will see Mario emerge from the Mushroom Kingdom and into the real world. The trailer showed sections where he's scaling New York like a certain spider-powered man. \nMario will be equipped with a sentient hat this time around, one with eyes that can be used as a makeshift platform. \nStrange setting aside, Super Mario Odyssey is being developed by Tokyo EAD, the studio responsible for Eurogamer's Game of the Year 2013, Super Mario 3D World.
