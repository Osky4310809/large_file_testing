Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA young woman almost died after she was misdiagnosed with a chest infection when she says she was actually suffering a rare side effect from the contraceptive pill . \nLike millions of women in the UK, Lucy Powell, 21, was taking a tablet each day to prevent herself from falling pregnant. \nBut she says the popular NHS -prescribed Yasmin was causing life threatening blood clots to form on her lungs - restricting her oxygen supply. \nDoctors were baffled by her condition as she began to cough up blood and put it down to being a chest infection. Lucy Powell started taking the contraceptive pill in December (Photo: Mirror Online) \nLucy said she didn't want to \"pester\" the emergency services and her worry about bothering them almost cost her her life as she stayed in bed and missed an appointment. \nThis month Lucy has been discharged from hospital and now wants to speak out about her terrifying ordeal to urge other women to be persistent with health professionals and to highlight the dangers of the pill. \nThe criminology student, from East Sussex, says she was prescribed Yasmin in December 2016 and started taking it once a day. \nBy Christmas, she started to feel tired and drained. Lucy Powell (Photo: Mirror Online) \n\"I began to feel really under the weather and developed a cough but I didn't want to go to GP because I was worried about wasting their time,\" she said. \nAfter an exam in January, the Sheffield Hallam university student discovered she couldn't walk more than a few metres before becoming short of breath. \n\"I'm fairly active and was noticing my health deteriorate rapidly, at one point I couldn't even roll over in bed and change position without gasping for air,\" she said. \nShe says she went to a walk-in medical centre after coughing up blood and losing her appetite and was initially diagnosed with a chest infection. Lucy Powell in hospital during her health scare (Photo: Mirror Online) \n\"I was told to just rest and drink plenty of water,\" she said. \nLucy was sent home but over the course of the next few days as she waited for the results of a chest x-ray, her breathing became critical. \nShe dialled 111 in a panic but she says an adviser suggested she rested and didn't pass her call onto a doctor. \n\"This is really hard when I look back and think how easy it would have been for me just to think I need rest. Lucy said the chest infection wrong diagnosis cost her a lot of time (Photo: Mirror Online) \n\"I should have called 999 but I was so scared of wasting their time. I don't blame 111 at all as they have a set of questions they have to follow. \n\"But because I was sent down this route of thinking I had a chest infection, it cost me a lot of time as anyone I spoke to thought it must be related to that,\" she said. \nAnd time was precious as with each day, unbeknownst to Lucy, the clots were growing larger and more dangerous, she explains. \nLucy was offered an appointment with a nurse but cancelled as she couldn't find the energy to get out of bed. Lucy Powell in hospital during her health scare (Photo: Mirror Online) \n\"It scares me because at this stage, it would have been so easy for me to think, 'Just stay in bed and rest and drink water, it's just a chest infection, don't worry about it'\", she said. \nBut what happened next may have saved her life. \nOn the Monday morning, Lucy had a doctor's appointment and somehow she managed to summon the strength to go. \n\"I was gasping for air on my way there but I found it in me to go and it was lucky I did,\" she said. An oxygen tank used during her treatment (Photo: Mirror Online) \n\"The doctor tested my oxygen levels and they were dangerously low in the 80s, the doctor called 999 and I was rushed to a & e,\" she said. \nLucy was taken to the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield where she says medics were at first confused by her condition. \n\"They didn't know what was up with me and ran lots of tests. \n\"After a while said there was an incredibly small chance it could be a blood clot. Lucy Powell with the breathing help during her treatment (Photo: Mirror Online) \n\"It was quite scary, sitting there on oxygen with no clue what was happening. \n\"I was on four litres of oxygen and even had to be wheelchaired to the toilet with it because I couldn't breathe without it,\" she said. \nShe said a lifesaving CT scan revealed why Lucy had been struggling to breathe - two large blood clots had formed on her lungs. \n\"If they had got bigger or travelled to my heart, it would have killed me,\"she said. \nDoctors told Lucy she had a pulmonary embolism - a version of deep vein thrombosis where a clot forms and travels to the lung, she said. \nBlood clots are a curable condition but become fatal when they break free and block the main arteries to the lungs or heart. Lucy praised the NHS staff who helped her recover (Photo: Mirror Online) \nAs many as 33,000 people a year die as a result of DVT. \nLucy now feels very lucky. \nShe praised the staff at the NHS hospital and doctors surgery and said they had been \"amazing\" throughout. \nBut her road to recovery isn't over yet as she has been left with an infection and will be on blood thinners for the next six months. \nThe ordeal may even affect her decision to have children in the future. \nMoving forward, Lucy said she is hoping to catch up with her course at university after missing almost an entire semester. Lucy Powell (Photo: Mirror Online) \nShe said: \"It's not the fault of anyone I just wish my oxygen levels had been tested earlier. \n\"In hindsight I should have called 999 as I could barely breathe but it's not in my nature to cause a fuss.\" \nHer message to other women taking the pill is simple: \"Do not discount the risks or just assume it's never going to happen to you. \n\"My advice would be making a really informed decision and make sure there is no history of blood clots in your family, it's very easy to get prescribed and not worry about the consequences.

It's certainly altered my perspective on life. \n\"I feel so lucky and grateful that I'm okay but it is hard to think things could have turned out differently'\" she added. \nResearch from the University of Nottingham found that taking Yasmin or other third-generation pills like Marcelo and Femodene raise the risk of blood clot four-fold compared to women not taking the pill.
