I usually can’t stand more than a couple hours in flats so I was very skeptical about these, but I wore them three consecutive days and nights, and was left with no blisters at all! I’m definitely going to buy a second pair to have when these get destroyed from the many wears they’ll be getting. They also are made from great materials as they survived those crazy nights with only slight scratches. They’re a must buy, I highly recommend them.
