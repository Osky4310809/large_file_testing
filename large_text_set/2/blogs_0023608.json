On duty at the train station since Feb. 12, the machine spotted a small fire on its first day. \n“Thankfully, the robot’s air monitoring and humidity monitoring functions helped us,” a human officer told Economic Daily . “If not we’d have a huge mess on our hands.” \nLittle else is known about the E-Patrol, which debuted just a few months after the AnBot (“An” meaning “security” in Chinese)—China’s first smart security service robot in operation at Shenzhen Bao’an International Airport since September . \nCruising around Terminal 3, the intelligent security robot was built for the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau by the National University of Defense Technology and Hunan Wanwei Intelligent Robot Technology Co. Similar in stature to the E-Patrol Sheriff, AnBot travels at a maximum speed of 11 miles per hour. Boasting a battery life of eight hours, the intelligent machine knows when to recharge, and automatically finds the nearest juicing station. \nWhile advanced androids protect and serve in China, roving robots are delivering food to hungry Americans: Starship last month partnered with DoorDash to test food distribution in Washington, D.C., and Redwood City, Calif. Starship is also teaming up with Postmates, the “revolutionary Urban Logistics platform” that, for the last five years, has been distributing virtually anything from stores and restaurants in 26 states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:47:41.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
