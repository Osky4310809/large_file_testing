It can tell the time, of course, but it can also beam important notifications straight to your wrist, and run native apps. \nWhat's more impressive is that many of today's best models can also perform a ton of novel tricks, such as enabling you to search the internet with your voice, tracking your exercise over GPS, and letting you check-out at the grocery store without reaching for your wallet. \nOh yeah – and they look absolutely stunning to boot. Feeling active? Check out our Best Fitness Trackers \nFor some time, jumping into the world of smartwatches was a risky move. But now, with competent efforts put forward from Google with Android Wear , Apple with watchOS, and more, there's never been a better time to strap up with wearable technology. \nChoosing the smartwatch that's right for you isn't easy, but we hope to make the exciting process of getting paired up with your next (or first!) smartwatch as simple as possible. Looking for something running Google's OS? Here's our best Android Wear smartwatch round-up 1. LG Watch Sport \nGoogle's Android phone on your wrist \nOS: Android Wear 2.0 | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Display: 1.38\" OLED | Processor: Snapdragon Wear 2100 | Band sizes: Fixed large band | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery: 16 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IP68 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC Calls and data without a phone Excellent strength training Appealing design despite big size Battery life falls short Standalone apps still coming Phone calls (US only) require a SIM card \nLG Watch Sport is the smartwatch to beat right now simply because it's a full-featured fitness tracker wrapped in a smartwatch running Android Wear 2.0. While other smartwatches can do \"fitness tracking\" that just amounts to logging runs and calories burned, this watch tracks your all-important strength training, too. \nIt's also one of the few smartwatches that supports an LTE connection, meaning, if you pop a SIM card into the back of the watch, it can make and receive calls and data – without your smartwatch nearby. \nIt doesn't have the best battery life, despite its bigger-than-normal size, and apps are still being announced for Google's newly refreshed platform. But it's a proper step up for Android Wear and smartwatches in general. \nRead the full review: LG Watch Sport 2. Apple Watch 2 \nFitness takes over the Apple Watch \nOS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53\" OLED | Processor: S2 dual-core | Band sizes: Varies drastically per watch size | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC Water-resistant Expensive Lack of useful apps \nThe Apple Watch 2 is the best smartwatch you can buy right now. It's water-resistant, which means it's more durable than most of the other devices on this list and you won't have to worry about getting it wet in the rain when you're out for a jog. \nThere's GPS onboard to make running that little bit easier plus it comes running the newest watchOS 3 software. Design wise it's looking very similar to the original Apple Watch. Be warned though, the Apple Watch 2 is expensive. \nIf you already own an Apple Watch, the Apple Watch 2 may not be worth the upgrade, but there are a few solid improvements that mean it's worth spending that bit extra if this is your first wearable from Apple. \nRead the full review: 3. Samsung Gear S3 \nSamsung's latest goes big against Apple - literally \nOS: Tizen OS | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Display: 1.3\" 360 x 360 Super AMOLED | Processor: Dual-core 1.0GHz | Band sizes: S (105 x 65mm) L (130 x 70mm) | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery duration: 3 days | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IP68 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 4G Intuitive interface Very large on wrist Severe lack of apps \nDespite a serious lack of original apps, the Samsung Gear S3 is one of the best smartwatch options on the market. \nThe intuitive controls and Super AMOLED screen from the Samsung Gear S2 are back in full form here. Plus, GPS makes its debut on the Gear S3. \nWhile its look is more executive than the Gear S2, it rocks a IP68-protected build and can last up to 3 days of use before needing a charge. \nSamsung recently made the Gear S3 (and Gear S2, for that matter) compatible on iOS. So, if you're looking for a more traditional-looking alternative to the Apple Watch, you may have found your match. \nRead the full review: Samsung Gear S3 4. LG Watch Style \nThe thinnest Android Wear smartwatch yet \nCompatibility: Android 4.3+, iOS8.2+ | Display: 1.2\" 360 x 360 P-OLED | Processor: Snapdragon Wear 2100 | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery duration: Up to 24h | Charging method: Conductive USB charger | IP rating: IP67 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Devilishly good-looking Disappointing battery life Lacks NFC and broader connectivity \nThe LG Watch Style (built in collaboration with Google) offers everything that's to love from the best Android Wear smartwatches , ditches the dreaded flat tire, then fills in the gap with cool, useful features and a whole lot of… style . \nRoll that all up and you're left with an extremely alluring presentation that makes a mighty strong argument for Google's wearable platform. But there are some familiar wrinkles here. \nBattery life is still a low point, and, as independent as Android Wear 2.0 claims to be, Google is still in the early days of filling the new Play Store with compatible apps that are enticing enough to bother with aside from its own. The Style's appeal lies more in what it will be soon, rather than what it is at launch. \nThat said, it’s easy to express why the Style is the only smartwatch we want to put on our wrists. For $249 (£249 / AU$325, but not confirmed for AU), it offers just as much utility as prior smartwatch attempts, but ups the ante with a slim, dashing design and several welcome features, like the voice-activated Google Assistant and a refreshed user interface that's full of clever tweaks. \nRead the full review: LG Watch Style 5. Sony SmartWatch 3 \nA powerful, well-equipped wearable and super cheap wearable \nOS: Android Wear | Compatibility: Android | Display: 1.6\" LCD | Processor: Quad-core 1.2GHz | Case dimensions: 36mm diameter, 10mm thick | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery: 2 days | Charging method: via microUSB | IP rating: IP68 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS Slick performance Not super-stylish Counterintuitive charging port \nSurprised to see the Sony SmartWatch 3 so close to the top? Well, you shouldn't be. \nThe Sony SmartWatch 3 stands out from many of today's competition, with its impressive performance, a good screen and solid battery life, not to mention the inclusion of GPS, which makes it a better fitness accessory than most smartwatches. \nThis wearable just about nails the tricky blend of being a smartwatch with competent fitness tracking capabilities and the price keeps on falling, making it a real bargain. \nFor something a bit more premium, there's the Sony Smartwatch 3 Steel, which is basically the same, but with a metal body and face, along with a higher price tag. \nRead the full review: Sony Smartwatch 3 6. Moto 360 (2nd Gen) \nMoto's smartwatch is a thing of beauty \nOS: Android Wear | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Display: 1.37\" or 1.56\" LCD | Processor: Quad-core 1.2GHz | Case dimensions: 42mm or 46mm diameter, each 11.4mm thick | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery: 1.5-2 days depending on size | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IP67 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Beautiful design Battery life remains iffy Flat tire bezel is back \nThe second generation oto 360 certainly gets our vote as the best smartwatch when it comes to look. Plus, it's also one of the most comfortable wearables around. \nThe new size options give the Moto 360 the extra reach it needed the first time around. That, and the new-found comfortable fit (along with the added customization to the design), brings it all together as one of the best smartwatches of 2016, and still a strong option in 2017. \nRead the full review: Moto 360 7. Asus ZenWatch 3 \nZenWatch grows up with its third iteration \nOS: Android Wear | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Display: 1.39\" 400 x 400 AMOLED | Processor: Snapdragon Wear 2100 | Case dimensions: 44mm diameter, 9.9mm thick | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery: 2 days | Charging method: via proprietary USB charger | IP rating: IP67 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Gorgeous display Lacks heart rate sensor, NFC, GPS Proprietary straps \nIf you’re in the market for an Android Wear smartwatch, the Asus ZenWatch 3 should be near the top of your list. It has a great display, useful hardware buttons and good battery life. \nIt’s styling might not be for everyone, and it's lacking in a few sensors, but Asus did a commendable job designing a watch that looks more like a premium watch than a piece of lifeless technology. \nRead the full review: Asus ZenWatch 3 8. Huawei Watch \nHuawei's wearable debut makes a striking entrance \nOS: Android Wear | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Display: 1.4\" AMOLED | Processor: Quad-core 1.2GHz | Case dimensions: 42mm diameter, 11.3mm thick | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery: 2 days | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IP67 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Premium build and materials Only comes in one size So-so battery life \nThe Huawei Watch is not perfect, with iffy battery life watering down the gorgeous presentation. \nBut the once high price is rapidly dropping and it's a near seamless blend of fashion and technology, and edges closer to earning the 'smartwatch I'd actually wear' title. \nRead the full review: Huawei Watch 9. LG Watch Urbane \nIt's beautiful and deluxe, but not for everyone \nOS: Android Wear | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Display: 1.3\" P-OLED | Processor: Quad-core 1.2GHz | Case dimensions: 45.5mm diameter, 10.9mm thick | Onboard storage: 4GB | Battery: 2 days | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IP67 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Fashionable", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:20:02.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
