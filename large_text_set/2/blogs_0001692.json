Picture: Brett Costello \n“He’s a very resilient kid and handles training quite well which is great because it’s his first pre-season,” McGregor said. \n“The last three months he hasn’t missed any contact (training). \n“He’s the fittest and our quickest player and that’s important when a young man is coming through. \n“But he’s untried, so in the trials we’ll really see how he stands up. \n“If he gets through that well, and he performs better than the other players, he’ll get the opportunity.” \nAnother young star who has been impressing during the pre-season is Matt Dufty. \nThere had been some speculation McGregor was toying with the idea of moving Josh Dugan to the centres to accommodate the 21-year-old at fullback, but the coach dismissed the switch — for now. media_camera St George Illawarra player Matt Dufty. Picture: Gregg Porteous \n“Josh will be fullback at this stage,” McGregor said. \n“’Duff’ will get a really good opportunity through the trials because Josh won’t play in the Tigers trial. \n“If Duff comes up with something special, things can change pretty quickly in rugby league, because Josh can play right centre. \n“We’ve got to remember, it’s his first year out of NYC. \n“The best thing for him at this stage is to keep working hard at training and certainly take that opportunity through the trials and you never know. \n“Again, if he’s good enough, he’ll be getting an opportunity in first grade.” \nMcGregor said he wouldn’t consider transitioning Dufty into first grade via the wing like some players have done in the past. \n“I don’t believe in age or size, I believe in talent,” he said. \n“He’s a very talent footballer. This is his second pre-season so he’s in much better shape this year than he was last year. \n“He’s a fullback because he’s a very good ballplayer. He’d be wasted on the wing and you probably need more size in bringing the ball back on the wings. \n“His talent lies in his ball playing ability and his speed.” \nDownload the new FOX SPORTS App to get the latest news and scores from your NRL team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:35:58.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
