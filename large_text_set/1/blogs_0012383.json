As a kid, I hoarded tubes of ChapStick's iconic lip balms in my backpack, so now, as a full-fledged adult (well, jury's still out on that one), I had to try its grown-up version. Unlike traditional lip exfoliants on the market, which are typically dense, gritty, and expectedly messy, the ChapStick Total Hydration Conditioning Lip Scrub, which is made with hydrating coconut oil and nourishing shea butter, has a creamy, pasty texture with just a bit of grit (that's thanks to its superfine sugar crystals). I really appreciate its texture because there's nothing more annoying than scrubbing your lips with a formula that literally falls to the floor as you swipe. But I digress. What's also cool about this scrub is its minty scent, which is surprisingly refreshing and not at all aggressive. Wearing it was almost like getting away with not brushing my teeth after lunch (yes, I brush my teeth after every meal—thanks, Invisalign), which, again, was a welcome perk. Related Skin The 15 Best Eye Creams My only complaint with the scrub would be that because I have truly chapped lips (matte lipstick's worst enemy)—which I'm chalking up to genetics—I found that it didn't completely slough off all of my flakes. Even after following the directions to a T—massaging the creamy stuff in a circular motion on my wet lips and then removing with a damp cloth—my lips were still on the slightly chapped side. Sure, they were smoother and healthier looking and, overall, felt better (at least temporarily), but some of the flakes were still intact.
