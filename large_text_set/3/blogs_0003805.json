There are all kinds of stories, rumors, game coverage, and Vines of dudes getting hit in the beans every day. Trying to find all of it while on your way to work or sitting at your desk just isn’t easy. It’s OK, though. We’re going to do the heavy lifting for you each morning and find the things you need to see from within the SB Nation baseball network, as well as from elsewhere. Please hold your applause until the end, or at least until after you subscribe to the newsletter .\n* * *\nThe 2017 World Baseball Classic isn't Israel's first, but it does mark their first entry into the main tournament. In 2013, Israel played in the qualifiers and failed to advance, but this time around, they not only qualified, but might already have punched their ticket to the second round of the main tournament. Israel won the opening contest of the WBC against the host of Pool A, Korea, defeating them 2-1 in extra innings. Israel then followed that up with a 15-7 rout of Chinese Tapei to give them two wins in the first round: if Israel defeats the Netherlands on Wednesday, they'll be the top team out of Pool A and a guaranteed spot in round two of the WBC. Even if they don't defeat the Netherlands, the top two teams from each pool advance, and the top three from each pool automatically qualify for the 2021 WBC. Israel can already consider the 2017 tournament a major success.\nThis is bad news for Korea, who has been in every WBC thus far and, as mentioned, is hosting Pool A this year. Korea not only lost to Israel, but faced the Netherlands in their second game and were shut out 5-0. They've now played 19 innings of baseball, managed all of one run, and are in danger of not even qualifying for the 2021 World Baseball Classic -- the team that finishes last in each pool is entered into the qualifying tournament that will take place in 2020. While Korea would stand a great chance of emerging from the qualifiers into the main tournament, it's not a hoop they're expecting to have to jump through, ever.\nKorea's fate is now tied to the performance of everyone else in Pool A. If they're to advance to the second round, they need the Netherlands to lose to both Israel and Chinese Tapei, but they also need to defeat Chinese Tapei in their own match-up to keep from being at the bottom of the pool. They also need to start scoring, as run differential can come into play in the case of a tie. The Netherlands dropping both of their remaining games is difficult to fathom, but hey, Korea wasn't supposed to start 0-2, either.\nRyan Lavarnway never became the power-hitting threat behind the plate his prospect status hinted at, but he went deep against Chinese Tapei to put Israel up 6-0 early on Monday. The Netherlands' roster features a number of talented, young MLB players, and they are already making their presence felt just one game in. Here are the full results of the World Baseball Classic so far. Did you wake up sometime well after 5 a.m. this morning? Don't worry, you can catch China taking on Cuba in Pool B action at 10 p.m. Tuesday on MLB Network. Netherlands' pitcher Rob Cordemans has been in the WBC before as well as the Olympics, and the 42-year-old has seen it all . Meet Jen Mac Ramos, the first openly non-binary executive in pro sports . Ramos was hired by the Sonoma Stompers as their assistant GM, and you might even recognize their name from your time reading SB Nation sites. Congrats, Jen! Over in MLB, nagging injuries are starting to mount for the Dodgers. Mariners players hired a personal mariachi band to follow Leonys Martin around on his birthday.
