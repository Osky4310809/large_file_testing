STOPPAGE \nHowever, it’s not always as simple as that because there are some unfortunate incidents which result in the referees unintentionally getting involved in the action.

Article continues below Arsene Wenger is 'fuming' with what Mesut Ozil is planning to do [Sun] \nBrink followed that up with a barrage of punches and the referee did a brilliant job of stepping in so Nehm didn’t have to suffer any more unnecessary damage at the hands of his opponent. \nWhile the fight was over for Brink and he added a win to his record before running off in celebration, Nehm decided that wasn’t the end of his night as the cameras caught him coming forward to attack the referee. REAR NAKED CHOKEHOLD \nAs you’ll be able to see in the video below, Brink was sitting on top of the cage before the cameras started to focus on Nehm who had mounted the referees back and tried to execute a rear naked chokehold before having to be pulled off – with great difficulty – by his team. \nAt one stage, he even transitioned to his side to lock in the hold much tighter, but it seems as if his team split them up just in time before more damage could have been caused, as they convinced him that the referee wasn’t his opponent. \nThe common assumption is that Nehm was so dazed by the stoppage that he assumed the referee was his opponent and he tried to submit him when he saw an advantage. \nHowever, as we have seen in multiple cases in the past, fighters sometimes aren’t happy with an early stoppage and decide to let the referee know how they’re feeling about it. \nAlthough, in this case, it’s difficult to determine whether it was intentional or not. \nMaybe Nehm should have executed that submission hold in the fight itself, rather than saving his impressive moves for after the fight. \nWhat did you make of Joseph Nehm trying to choke out the referee?
