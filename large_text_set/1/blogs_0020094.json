If you‚Äôre ‚Äúhappy‚Äù, then hapiness should have a much higher impact on lifespan then the negative impact of ejaculation, i guess. \nI read a few interesting, ‚Äúnon-technical‚Äù but still empirical books about health and aging and one of them in particular, ‚ÄúThe Blue Zones‚Äù by Dan Buettner comes to mind. In it, he is sent by the National Geographic to find the hotspots in the world where there is the highest proportion of centenarians in the populations and then meet them and try to learn about their lifestyle, food, social life, environment, etc and there are a few clear markers that make people live much longer than others and most of them are not food itself. \nTo live longer, from my searches, i would prioritize those 2 first (real list from the book follows): \n1- the WILL to live. Although it might sound strange, i think that most people don‚Äôt ‚Äúwant to live‚Äù but rather they ‚Äúwant not to die‚Äù and that makes a huge difference in life expectancy. 2- a REASON to go on. Most north american (and people i know that are 60+ yrs old) just have no plans, no measurable goals, and just seem like they are waiting to die. They retire then do nothing. People that lived 100+ yrs in the study wanted something, for example a project to finish, a grand children to take care of and make sure they do well in school, etc. \nHere are the official list from the survey of the ppl that live the longest (the book might be worth a look if you‚Äôre interested in that) (#5 & 6 might please you Tim üòâ ): \n1- Move Naturally The world‚Äôs longest-lived people don‚Äôt pump iron or run marathons. Instead, their environments nudge them into moving without thinking about it. 2- Purpose Why do you wake up in the morning? Knowing your sense of purpose is worth up to seven years of extra life expectancy. 3- Down Shift Stress leads to chronic inflammation, associated with every major age-related disease. The world‚Äôs longest-lived people have routines to shed that stress. 4- 80% Rule ‚ÄúHara hachi bu‚Äù ‚Äì the Okinawans say this mantra before meals as a reminder to stop eating when their stomachs are 80 percent full. 5- Plant Slant The cornerstone of most centenarian diets? Beans. They typically eat meat‚Äîmostly pork‚Äîonly five times per month. 6- Wine @ 5 Moderate drinkers outlive non-drinkers, especially if they share those drinks with friends. 7- Belong Attending faith-based services four times per month ‚Äì no matter the denomination ‚Äì adds up to 14 years of life expectancy. 8- Loved Ones First Centenarians put their families first. They keep aging parents and grandparents nearby, commit to a life partner and invest in their children. 9- Right Tribe They world‚Äôs longest lived people chose or were born into social circles that support healthy behaviors. \nOf course some of these can me slightly modified (change ‚Äúfaith‚Äù for hapiness or spirituality and #1 you can probably move more (aka train) if your food nutrient density matches the change. Don‚Äôt forget that the people that are 100+ yrs old now were born 100 yrs ago and had a very different mindset and life, so let‚Äôs ‚Äúadjust‚Äù a bit) \nWould appreciate similar books suggestion if any; hopes this helps! \nJoel", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T10:17:47.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
