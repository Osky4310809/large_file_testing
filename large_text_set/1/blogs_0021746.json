Well, it is, and especially when things are this volatile politically sometimes all it takes is a hug to bring tensions down. You can't have a day dedicated to hugs without the Queen of hugs herself, WWE 's Bayley . \nIn celebration of the big day WWE shared a video recapping as many of Bayley's hugs as could fit in a YouTube video. The popular superstar is known for hugging her fans on the way down the ramp, both at live events and on television, but as the video shows she often hugs the staff and backstage employees as much as she does the fans. \nKind of hard not to like her right? You can take in all the hugging brilliance in the video below. \nOne of those hugs featured in the video is with fellow Monday Night RAW superstar Sasha Banks. The two have shared a friendship since their NXT rivalry days, and the duo was able to put together some all-star matches during their time there. In a recent interview with the Montgomery Advertiser podcast, Bayley was asked what her dream WrestleMania match would consist of, and it would definitely include The BOSS. \n\"There is a few but the number one that always sticks out would be myself vs Sasha Banks one more time for the women's championship, and honestly I would love to be victorious in that match, but you know just the idea of having that match alone whether she won or I won, It would just be such a special moment for both of us so, that's my ultimate, ultimate dream.\" \nBefore that can happen she has to beat Charlotte, and their feud will continue at the Royal Rumble on January 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:18:58.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
