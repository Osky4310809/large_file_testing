At least 32 Republicans, both very conservative and moderate, are currently expected to vote no. Ryan can only afford to lose 21 votes. My latest whip list based on what I'm hearing. Unless something changes between now and the vote, #AHCA is going down. pic.twitter.com/qNVEfTZQRn — Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) March 24, 2017 GOP rep told me this AM he believed bill would be pulled -- leadership wouldn't put it to a vote and see it go down. No reason to. https://t.co/N551U3Osam — Eliana Johnson (@elianayjohnson) March 24, 2017 Needless to say, Ryan's visit could well be to tell the President this vote and this bill aren't happening. Wow. @DanaBashCNN reporting Ryan is going to show Trump the votes and tell him they don't have them. He'll ask what Trump wants to do now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T21:18:44.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
