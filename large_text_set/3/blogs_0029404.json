She styled the classic dinosaur sweater impeccably , finishing her look with a complementing patchwork handle bag. And later, when Selena teamed up with Coach and the label's charity partner Step Up to visit LA high schools, she stuck to her new signature uniform . \nSelena started the day in Coach's camo rose jacket and eventually switched into the sporty reversible satin jacket. Her J Brand skinny jeans, ankle-strap heels, and white tank provided an easy foundation for not one, but technically three different coats. Selena contrasted her casual-cool looks with a hot pink Swagger bag, one final nudge to shop. Scroll to get inspired, then scoop up Selena's essentials of the day.
