Here are some exciting radiation headlines from the Web:\nDeadly radioactive particles are found across Europe, and scientists have no idea where they came from -- Daily Mail\nConcerns Grow About A Nuclear \"Incident\" In Europe After Spike In Radioactive Iodine Levels -- ZeroHedge\nU.S. Air Force deploys WC-135 nuclear sniffer aircraft to UK as spike of radioactive Iodine levels is detected in Europe -- The Aviationist\nFROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE? Dangerous radioactive particles have been detected across Europe and no-one knows where they came from\nScientists baffled after detecting cancer-causing chemical that's produced during nuclear disasters or atomic bomb blasts -- The Sun (UK)\nLike the recent Fukushima follies, again we have a combination of clickbait headlines and pig ignorance about radiation, and like the last one, I'm willing to bet we'll be seeing stories about how everyone is DOOMED. So once again, let's look at the facts first.\n(If you need a refresher, see my \" Understanding Radiation \" piece.)\nThe isotope Iodine-131 (131I) was detected in the air in several locations in Europe. Now, this is intrinsically interesting: 131I is one of the isotopes that is a fission product when fissionable uranium fissions. So detecting 131I is a sign that someone may have set off a fission bomb or had a reactor accident. As a result, a lot of money and research has gone into being able to detect 131I at very low concentrations.\nOf course, we have other ways of detecting bombs or reactor accidents and none of them detected anything unusual. So, let's look for details:\nIn France, particulate 131I reached 0.31 µBq/m3 and thus the total (gaseous + particulate fractions) can be estimated at about 1.5 µBq/m3. These levels raise no health concerns.\nLet's translate this. The important part, as always, is in the numbers. A Bequerel, abbreviated Bq is a measure of how much radioactive material there is. 1 Bq means that one atom is decaying every second. The Greek letter mu, µ, also sometimes called a micron , indicates one one-millionth. Of course the m3 indicates a cubic meter, a cube 1 meter on a side, or about 36 cubic feet, 264 gallons.\nSo the total 131I they were detecting was about 1.5 µBq/m3.\nExcept -- well, you can't have 1.5 millionths of a Bq. A atom can't decay only part-way, either it does or it doesn't. So you have to multiply the whole thing by 2 million, giving us 3 Bq per 2 million cubic meters .\nAnd how big is that ? Well, this gave me an excuse to use some images of my favorite aircraft ever, LuftSchiff LZ#129, the Graf von Zeppelin . It turns out that the Zeppelin had a gas volume of 200,000 m3. So, how much 131I is there?\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/21/were-doomed-more-awful-media-coverage-of-a-radiation-incident/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2907525/dangerous-radioactive-particles-are-drifting-across-europe-and-no-one-knows-why/", "https://theaviationist.com/2017/02/19/u-s-air-force-deploys-wc-135-nuclear-sniffer-aircraft-to-uk-after-spike-of-radioactive-iodine-levels-detected-in-europe/", "http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-19/concerns-grow-about-nuclear-incident-europe-after-spike-radioactive-iodine-levels", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4242058/Radioactive-particles-spotted-Europe.html"], "published": "2017-02-21T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:43:04.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
