It is now being reported that the South Korean smartphone giant’s next phablet, the Galaxy Note 8 , is codenamed ‘Baikal.’ For those who aren’t in the know, Baikal is a lake situated in southern Siberia, considered to be the deepest lake in the world. \nThe Galaxy Note 8 is expected to feature a 4K display (for better VR experience) and the AI-powered virtual assistant Bixby . Samsung will reportedly source batteries for the device from LG . Nothing much is known about the upcoming phablet as of now, but we will keep on reporting about the device as and when we get any new information about it.
