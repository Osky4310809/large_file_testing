However, Weezy’s 18-year-old daughter Reginae Carter has chimed in on the lightly smoldering feud to illustrate her dad might simply not know who the Florida rapper is. \nOn Sunday (January 15), Carter retweeted a photo of her father and the 19-year-old Kodak side by side that was captioned, “RT for Wayne Like for Kodak.” Carter added a caption in her retweet that read, “When Lil Wayne doesn’t even know who the heck Kodak is,” which was shared and liked nearly 3,000 times respectively.
