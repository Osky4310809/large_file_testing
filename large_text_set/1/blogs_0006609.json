Crispin Blunt Credit: Chris Ison/PA Wire \nC rispin Blunt , another Tory Israeli critic, was also mentioned in the discussions between Mr Masot and Ms Strizzolo. \nMr Blunt, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee described the alleged comments about Sir Alan as \"outrageous\" \nLord Polak, a senior director of Conservative Friends of Israel, dismissed allegations that any British political party had been taken over by any organisation. \n\"The Friends of Israel groups do their job of educating their members about the complicated issues in the Middle East. The Israeli embassy represents Israel in a professional manner. To suggest they are involved in anything sinister is poppycock.’' \nMs Strizzolo said that her conversation with Mr Masot was \"tongue in cheek\". He was a friend whom she was meeting purely socially, she said. \nShe dismissed as \"risible\" suggestions she could exert that sort of influence.
