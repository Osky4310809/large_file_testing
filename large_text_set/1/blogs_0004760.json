Add a photo to this gallery Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 \" Yes, there are juggernauts returning from the previous games; there will be several different types of them, too. \" — Rubin discussing Juggernauts in Modern Warfare 3 . Juggernaut (left) and Armored Juggernaut (right) in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 . \nJuggernauts appear in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 , once again taking the form of enemies in Special Ops , Survival Mode and Special Ops Chaos . \nCompared to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 , Juggernauts in this game are noticeably slower, moving at a steady walk instead of running, although they can sprint (albeit slower than a regular soldier) to catch up with the player if the player is on the far side of the map (they will also sprint when their health is low). \nAs with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 , and unlike their Black Ops counterparts, Juggernauts are tough enemies, with the basic variant capable of withstanding at least 70 assault rifle rounds at close range or around 80 to 90 rounds at long range, while the armored counterpart is significantly more durable. Juggernauts also receive a minor health multiplier in later rounds or higher difficulty maps. \nJuggernauts appear in three variants: the regular Juggernaut armed with a PKP Pecheneg , the Riot Shield Juggernaut armed with a Riot Shield and said light machine gun, as well as the Armored Juggernaut which begins to appear in later boss waves and possesses heavier armor (visually similar in appearance to the EOD suit seen in the campaign and multiplayer) which allow them to sustain even more damage than a regular Juggernaut. Juggernauts will never drop their PKP Pecheneg when killed, although Riot Shield Juggernauts will drop their Riot Shield. However, the dropped shield will invariably have its durability almost depleted (note that unlike other modes, player-held Survival mode Riot Shields eventually break from damage). Survival Mode \nOn Easy difficulty, they mostly appear in waves 10 (one Juggernaut), 15 (two Juggernauts), 20 (three Juggernauts), and 26 (two Armored Juggernauts and one Riot Shield Juggernaut). On the opposite end of the spectrum is Insane difficulty, where they first appear in every sixth wave (waves 6, 11 and 16), and from then on, in every third wave (19, 22, 25, 28, etc.); on Insane, they are accompanied by 6 to 12 normal troops, sometimes dogs, and attack helicopters, increasing the complexity and difficulty of handling the Juggernauts. \nThey enter the map via an Mi-8 helicopter (which can be attacked but is invulnerable for balance purposes). Once the helicopter is in position, a smoke grenade will be thrown and the Juggernaut will rappel down into the smoke. They will destroy any Sentry Turrets if they see them and/ or if attacked by the turret. The most effective weapons to kill a Juggernaut are explosives (C4 can be deployed under the rope they rappel from and used for an easy kill), shotguns (specifically the automatic models) and light machine guns. \nSome types of assault rifles are usable against the Juggernaut, but only high damage ones are able to eliminate a Juggernaut with any practical success, examples would be the CM901 and the MK14 , because both possess high damage, and the CM901 is capable of eliminating a Juggernaut at close range with one magazine at earlier waves if the player lands most of the shots in the head, or two magazines if hitting the body. The MK14 can be used if the player is fast enough, and more often than not, will eliminate a Juggernaut probably as fast as any other effective weapon for killing Juggernauts. Another effective method is with the M60E4, the player will need to get close to it and move around it staying out of its sights and shooting it and knife it a few times to take it down. \nIf the player uses a SMG or machine pistol, keeping a distance from the Juggernaut and aiming at the head can be effective. \nFlashbangs are also extremely useful because they can incapacitate a Juggernaut for several seconds and can give the player's team a chance to take it out. Predator missiles and airstrikes are also highly effective against these enemies due to their potential to kill multiple Juggernauts at once. Note that the airstrike will deal much more damage than a Predator, and won't require a direct hit on higher levels, although it is more difficult to use without the Juggernauts killing the player or moving out of the airstrike impact zone due to the wait-time before the AC-130 fires upon them. Flashbangs are useful for pinning them in place while waiting for the airstrike shells to arrive. If you run out of flashbangs, run in circles around them stabbing and shooting an auto shotgun at their general head area. Their extremely low maneuverability will allow the player to escape and never get shot whatsoever. Special Ops Chaos \nJuggernauts also appear in Special Ops Chaos Mode , in all three of their forms (Riot Shield, normal and Armored). Multiplayer \nJuggernaut armor crates can be acquired from the Juggernaut reward for Assault Strike Packages and the Juggernaut Recon reward for Support Strike Packages. All survivors in Infected \"Striker vs Jugg\" begin with a similar outfit by default and lose it once they are neutralized. The bomb carrier in 'Money in the Denk' is also equipped with heavy armor which disappears when the bomb is planted, when the player is killed, when the player leaves the game or when the match is over. For balance purposes, multiplayer Juggernauts have significantly less health than their Special Ops counterparts, unless they have a Riot Shield, and can easily be disposed of with a heavy explosive, or with headshots; alternatively, players facing these behemoths can simply use team tactics by concentrating substantial amounts of gunfire on them until they fall.
