The sound of sirens outside and a strange snap spurred us to move to a secure location. For more than four hours we sat on some stairs in a nondescript corridor waiting hungrily for snippets of information from the outside world. News of the madness that was unfolding beyond the relative security of the stairwell seemed distant and intangible . We all sat united in our hope that the death toll would rise no higher. How   unfolded \n\nM uch like the days following the murder of Jo Cox, the prevailing mood on the estate today is one of sombre defiance . The common areas are getting to be just as busy as always, yet an undeniable quiet hangs over the place. It's the same in the office as we each try to carry on with our work. Whilst it cannot be described as business as usual, parliamentary business is certainly being conducted. However, there is little doubt that the spectre of yesterday's attack looms over every office. \nThe staff of the parliamentary estate is a massive and diverse body made up in no small part by security officers and the police. Not a day goes by without a smile or a chat with a member of these forces who patrol the estate with admirable vigilance and dedication. The very fact that the many functions of the estate are operating today is testament to the determination of this body of staff to get themselves into work. Watch | Police hold minute's silence for PC killed in terror attack 02:06 \nP articular respect should be given to the colleagues and friends of PC Palmer who come to work today with his sacrifice at the fore of their minds. \nP C Palmer leapt to the defence of his colleagues and of the parliamentary estate with an instinctive heroism. His example was followed by the first responders and emergency services who attended the scene with bravery and determination. It is even more difficult to rationalise the deaths of those who were mown down on Westminster Bridge for simply being there, at the wrong place and at the wrong time. For them there is no great symbolism, simply more of the same tragedy. \nYesterday's attack has sent a tremor to the very core of the nation. However, those of us working in Parliament are determined not to stall or tarry, nor stumble in how we continue with our work. The wheels of Parliament will continue to turn. Watch | Westminster empty at night following terrorist incident 00:43 \nW e will never know what truly drove this person to plunge into a crowd of innocent pedestrians and attack a police officer. But what we can be sure of is that it must not dampen the indomitable spirit of the British people. This is not the first time that our values and heart have been attacked by the forces of hate and evil. Neither will it be the last. But once again the British public have been given the opportunity to unite behind the mantle of Great Britain and all of its diversity, freedom and courage. \nThe most important thing that we can do now is follow the lead of Parliament and conduct ourselves as usual. Allowing fear and concern to creep into the way in which we live would be the greatest victory for the terrorists that seek to create a cloud of fear above each of our heads. We must live our lives the same as ever to ensure that PC Palmer and the victims on Westminster bridge did not die so that extremism could win. \nC harlotte Smith is a researcher in the House of Commons Share this article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:02:41.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
