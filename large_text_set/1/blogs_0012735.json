Bridge! Galley! Garage! By Tom Phillips   \nBioWare's latest Andromeda Initiative video gives us a tour of the Tempest, your new Normandy-esque spaceship. \nBrighter, more open, but a little more compact overall, the Tempest still manages to squeeze in more than few familiar sections, such as the bridge, engineering, a medical bay, galley and a garage for your land vehicle - the Nomad. \nThe video is introduced by Kallo Jath, your new salarian pilot, who explains that he has been with the ship since its inception. \nNaturally, you have a personal quarters within the ship too - which seems massive compared to the bunks shared by your crew. It's off limits to everyone but you, Jath says, unless you invite someone. \nInterestingly, the Tempest prioritises speed and stealth over combat - your ship lacks a main gun, unlike the Normandy. \nThe video also shows off the Nomad's customisation options, which include boost and shield technology, as well as various paint jobs.
