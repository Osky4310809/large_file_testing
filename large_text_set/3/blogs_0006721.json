This risk-taking business is still new-fangled. But that doesn’t take away from the fact that it is, in fact, wildly welcome. In their lofty list of high-fiving season-defining trends, right before they become a national phenomenon, there has been an unexpected entrant. It is being hailed as “workwear stripes”.

Sure, bank stripes are straight-up formal but a little play on the silhouette, like this cool-girl dress on Kajal Aggarwal, has us convinced otherwise.
