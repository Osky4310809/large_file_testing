Now we know the time. 7pm Barcelona local time. Set your calendar appointments! If you can't be there, you'll want to tune into CrackBerry!\n\nFollowing their teaser that the BlackBerry 'Mercury' will be officially unveiled on February 25th, 2017, @bbmobile has just followed up with another tweet indicating the exact time of the event.\nThe event will kick off at 7pm GMT (Barcelona local time), which translates into 1pm ET/10am PT . Put in your calendars now as this will be the biggest launch event we've seen for a BlackBerry Smartphone since 2013's unveiling of the BlackBerry Z10 and Q10.\nIf you can't be there in person, the next best thing of course will be to tune into CrackBerry's coverage. With our 10 Year Anniversary celebrations in full swing, we're going to cover the hell out of this event! Even better, a big crew of our colleagues from @androidcentral will be there too, so the 'Mercury' coverage is going to be off the charts!\nJust to make sure you don't forget, we've added a good 'ole fashioned countdown clock to CrackBerry's website. Let the countdown begin!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:42:02.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
