Ben (far right) and friends were travelling to a pub crawl when they spotted the fleeing suspect PC Ben Perkins said it was possibly his most surreal arrest to date (Photo: Chris Woolgar) \nHe told Mirror.co.uk the arrest was the most surreal of his career. \nHe said: \"We saw him running from the store being chased by two security guards and another off-duty officer and that's when your instinct kicks in. \n\"As it was happening I did find myself looking down at what I was wearing and thinking 'this is a little bit surreal'. \n\"Even the arresting officer had to admit she was finding it a little difficult to take me seriously.\" \nThe group were travelling to central London to take part in the New Zealand-themed Waitangi Day pub crawl when the incident unfolded at around 1pm yesterday. \nThe officer said it was one of a small number of occasions he has been forced to apprehend a suspect while on duty. PC Perkins has been based in Wandsworth, South London, for three-and-a-half years \nHe said: \"It's probably the first I've had in about six months and it will definitely be one I always remember. \n\"Beyond the amusement, the members of the public were brilliant and several people stopped to do what they could to help.\" \nScotland Yard confirmed a man was arrested on suspicion of theft and enquiries are ongoing.
