On a recent visit to a high school, Guðni Th. Jóhannesson told students that he firmly opposes pineapple as a pizza topping, according to Iceland Magazine . \nAt the end of his visit to a high school in Akureyri, Jóhannesson opened up a Q&A session with students, which predictably turned into a discussion on topics like professional soccer and pizza. One student asked how he felt about pineapples as a pizza topping, and Jóhannesson admitted that he falls firmly in the “nay” camp in the fruit-on-pizza debate. Not only does he completely oppose putting pineapple on a pizza, but if he could, he said, he would pass a ban on it. \nIf he happened to be a dictator rather than the democratically elected leader of the most peaceful country in the world, you could be sure there would be a nationwide ban on any sort of tropical fruit pizza combinations. Alas, Icelanders are still welcome to ruin their pizzas with pineapple. The president later took to Facebook to amend his comments, saying that \"presidents should not have unlimited power,\" especially with regard to pizza toppings. \"I like pineapples, just not on pizza. I do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:42:09.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
