Tap out. You got to tap.' No doubt Scooter, the brains behind such stellar acts as Ariana Grande and Carly Rae Jepson, had to carry out an humiliating forfeit after losing their match. They've done this before: The twosome looked right at home as they rolled around on the lawn Right where he wants him: Justin managed to force Scooter's arm between his legs Who's the Big Daddy: Justin looked every inch the miniature Shirley Crabtree as he forced a submission Still best friends: The duo looked as close as ever as they chatted after their sweaty session Usually when a musical artiste rolls around in the dirt with their management it is over a monetary disagreement, but the pair looked as friendly as ever as they chatted following their thrilling battle royal. The self-styled hardman, who previously shared a thrilling boxing video where he worked out wearing pink gloves, was in attendance as he was recording a video with roly poly music mogul DJ Khaled, Chance The Rapper and Lil Wayne. The record producer real name Khaled Khaled, begged his fans to keep the shoot under wraps while boasting about it on social media. Sharing a group photo, he said: 'More history is being made FAN LUV I PROMISE YOU IM GOING ALL OUT ON MY 10th studio album #GRATEFUL !! ITS COMING!! Busy boy: The Sorry singer was in Calabasas to record a music video Man in the middle: Justin was surrounded by lackeys as he relaxed between takes Blonde ambition: The Canadian pop warbler seemed to be enjoying his day with the hip hop set 'Please keep this SECRET ANTHEM SECRET VIDEO! TOP SECRET!' The excitement comes just days after Justin explained why there was a 'pee stain' on his $700 Vetements sweatpants during an outing Wednesday. In a thrilling tweet he said: 'Someone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my d*** area. Puppet master: Music producer DJ Khaled had roped Justin in for a video shoot Phwoar: The pop pixie flaunted his dainty physique when he stripped off during the shoot Sly puff: Handsome rapper Lil wayne took a drag as he waited around on the set Making the magic happen: No doubt there are some who cannot wait to see the music project reach fruition 'Didn't bother me if it made ya laugh nice!' The Canadian Grammy winner must have gotten a lot of flack online for the awkward stain, which was 'spotted' as he exited Earthbar in West Hollywood. Justin's explanation came hours after he likened his embarrassing moment to a scene from Adam Sandler's supposed comedy Billy Madison. Quoting the immature hotel heir character from the 1995 film, he captioned a comparison: 'You ain't cool unless you pee your pants.' Loitering with intent: The lads looked like they could hardly wait for shooting to commence Dynamic duo: Justin stared admiringly at the jolly music impresario Boys in the (well-heeled) hood: The gang looked thrilled as they posed together Cavalier use of language: DJ Khalid hailed his sidekicks as musical 'icons' Share or comment on this article 511", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:17:03.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
