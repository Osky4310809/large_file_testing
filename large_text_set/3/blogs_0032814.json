By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 31, 2017 9:05 AM Earlier he had met MPs from Maharastra and Gujarat also. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi will be holding a breakfast meet with members of Parliament (MPs) from as many as 7 states this morning. The meeting between MPs from 7 states, including Karnataka, and PM Modi will take place at the Prime Minister’s official residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg in New Delhi. Earlier he had met MPs from Maharastra and Gujarat also. After BJP ’s historic win in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand assemble elections, PM Modi and BJP president has set their sights on Gujarat and Karnataka where polls will be held at the end of this year and in early 2018 respectively. “This victory march of BJP will now reach Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and will further enter the eastern and southern parts of the country,” BJP chief Amit Shah had said. \nShah also emphasized that “the win in the five state assembly elections is bigger than our victory in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. We will get a bigger mandate in 2019.” \nWatch this video \nCongress veteran and former Union minister S M Krishna had joined the BJP and said he was “humbled” to join the party which has leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has taken the country to great heights. The former Karnataka Chief Minister had quit the Congress after nearly 50 years in January after expressing his unhappiness for being sidelined. Krishna’s induction was also seen as a big boost to the BJP, which is now looking to spread its footprint in southern India ahead of the assembly elections in Karnataka next year. \nPraising both Modi and Shah, 84-year-old Krishna had said that these two leaders “have taken the country to great heights and this is not an exaggeration”. \nHe said he always enjoyed cordial relationships with BJP leaders since the time when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister. \nWelcoming Krishna into the BJP, Shah said his joining is a message to all honest politicians that they should strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Modi. \nTerming the Krishna’s decision to join the BJP as “timely one”, Shah said, “Krishna is joining the party after witnessing change in the country since Modi became Prime Minister. Since then the party’s acceptability across the country has gone up.” \nShah said his presence will increase the party’s strength not only in Karnataka but across the country.
