First, we saw singer Joy Villa wear a pro-Donald Trump inspired gown, and now Katy Perry just wore an armband emblazoned with the word \"persist\" during the performance of her new song \"Chained to the Rhythm.\" Yes, she went there and it was powerful AF. It's not surprising Perry took this moment to voice her feelings about President Trump. She was an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter during the presidential campaign, and still is. She takes to Twitter to voice her concern about the current political climate on the daily, which is why we were surprised her Grammys 2017 red carpet look was decidedly safe and free of any politics. Well, not for long, that's for sure. Right off the bat, you could see Perry's armband on the right side of her jacket with the word \"resist\" in all pink, capital letters. She's most likely talking about persist in the fight against Trump's presidency, specifically because of his comments on women, and his recent orders regarding immigration â€”both of which she's tweeted about (or retweeted the sentiments of others).

She also wore suffragette white , as a possible nod to the suffrage movement in the early 20th century, when it was one of the signature colors of the Women's Social and Political Union in Britain. And that's not all. At the end of Perry's performance, words from the Constitution showed on the screen behind both her and Skip Marley. It's safe to say, she's not keeping quiet about this issue any time soon. #", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:49:22.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
