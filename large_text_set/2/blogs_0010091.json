Longcroft Cat Hotel \nA luxury cat hotel offering temperature-controlled bedrooms and garden views for felines is to be opened in north London despite a row with neighbours over “cat smells”. \nAnimal lover Abi Purser, who founded Longcroft which runs a string of cat hotels, has been given permission to open a new branch in Barnet for up to 14 “guests” at a time. \nThe felines will have double bedrooms decorated with pictures on the walls, a private play area with views across the garden and a lockable cat flap for safety. \nBut pensioners living near to Haslemere Avenue hit out at the “unacceptable” plan, citing fears of increased waste, noise from “cats on heat” and increased traffic as customers arrive to drop off their pets. Pampered: The new cat hotel in Barnet has room for up to 14 cats. (Longcroft Cat Hotel) \nIn an objection to the council, neighbour Jane Bykar said: “The proposed development brings with it unsociable hours of operation. \n\"Cats do not clock off, they do not have set working hours. They will be caged 24/7.” \nFellow resident Josie Kinchin said: “The recent purchaser of this property should have been told that this is a strictly residential area with many bungalows occupied by retirees such as myself and my husband. \n“There would be hygiene issues, smells and cries of cats in unfamiliar surroundings. Inside one of the company's cat hotels. (Longcroft Cat Hotel) \n\"We have a major issue with foxes around here as well as rats and other vermin, they can all smell the pungent aroma of cats and it wouldn't take very long before this problem would be exacerbated. \n“How on earth they got away with one in the centre of London, I've no idea but we certainly don't need one in this neighbourhood.” \nBut founder of Longcroft cat hotel, Ms Purser, told the Standard she believes many residents objected without realising how well-kept the hotel branches are. \nShe also said that while the hotel will be luxury, it’s not “over the top”. Vets issue warning over 'cruel' trend for sausage cats \n“There are some places with televisions, candles and cocktails for the cats,” she said. “That’s over the top.” \n“We do have thermostatically controlled suites and all of their walls are decorated so they are not looking at a blank wall. It’s very homely but also incredibly clean, safe and warm.” \nThe former horse saddler for Britain’s Olympic equestrian team set up the company after struggling to find a cattery for her own rescue cat, Norman. \nShe said she was left shocked at the low standards and poor hygiene of many of the places available, and added animal welfare is “at the forefront of everything we do”. \nThe council’s Chipping Barnet planning committee approved the plans on Thursday evening. The vote was split 50-50 and the chairman gave the deciding vote, a council spokesman said. \nLongcroft hopes the cat hotel will be opened over the summer.
