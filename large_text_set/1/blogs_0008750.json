But they may get draft picks in return. \nIn addition to a first-round pick as well as two second-round picks and a third-round pick last year, the Rams traded their first and third-round picks in the upcoming draft for No. 1 overall pick Jared Goff as well. Related: Picturing a Rams draft without the Jared Goff trade, future and past \nHere’s how one writer explained the situation for Los Angeles ( via Turf Show Times ): \n“If the Rams receive a third-round compensatory pick, the compensatory pick goes to the Titans and the Rams keep their natural third-round selection. Otherwise, the Titans would get the Rams’ natural third-rounder.” \nAccording to Over The Cap , this is the first year that compensatory draft picks are allowed to be traded. \nThe report projects the Rams will receive a third round pick for Jenkins. McLeod is expected to yield a fourth round selection while Fairley will likely bring a sixth rounder. \nHere’s how compensatory draft picks are awarded in the NFL ( via AdamTJ13 ): \n“As the NFL explains, compensatory picks are awarded to teams that lose more or better compensatory free agents than they acquire. The number of picks a team can receive equals the net loss of compensatory free agents, up to a maximum of four.” \nIf the OTC projections are correct, the Rams will have four choices in the first 150 selections of the upcoming NFL Draft. \nWhile that’s not fantastic, there are certainly plenty of talented players the team can draft to fill some of their needs.
