The character is famously killed by Norman Bates ( Freddie Highmore ) in a shower. \nOn the fifth and final season of the A&E series, which shows Norman growing up into the killer seen in Psycho , Marion is having an affair with the husband ( Austin Nichols ) of a woman Norman befriends in town. \nDuring the most recent episode, Norman had a passionate kiss with the woman, but stopped it after he started to black out. It’s likely that Marion is about to show up at the Bates Motel looking to rent a room and we’re pretty sure Austin ‘s character Sam will show up too!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:38:29.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
