By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 15, 2017 3:56 PM (Twitter) \nSarabhai vs Sarabhai is on its way back, this time in its avatar as a web series. So be ready for a laugh punch and to dust out your nostalgic memories for a much-loved show which stopped after the first season itself. However, the large audience it had managed to collect, kept demanding more for the past 11 years and here it is finally! Sarabhai vs Sarabhai web series is likely to hit the screens in May, said the director of the show, Jamnadas Majethia to Mumbai Mirror. The story will not start at the same place it ended in, instead it takes an 11-year-leap. And yes, it retains the theme and characters will be exactly the same that the people loved. The story revolves around an upper class household in Mumbai which has peculiar characters like a middle-class daughter in law whose wisdom is best when it comes to bargaining in the super market and a son who writes incomprehensible, albeit original, poetry. “On public demand the show is coming back,” revealed Majethia. \nHe said that the shooting of the series will begin at the end of the month and release in May. After the first season, the actors got busy with other commitments and things deteriorated thereafter. But Majethia said that in every party or get-together where he went, people always asked him, when is he planning a season 2. But a good script was something he didn’t want to comrpomise with. Now, that seven years actors have taken out time for a tranformed Sarabhai vs Sarabhai, Majethia said, “The show will not miss anything that the audience loved”. \nAlso Watch: \nLast year he posted on Twitter a photograph of the Sarabhai family saying there is some good news in the offing for the fans. And this year, fans were been rewarded. Whether it will be a real one is still to be proven. The original stars included actors like Satish Shah, Ratna Pathak Shah, Sumeet Raghavan, Rupali Ganguly and Rajesh Kumar. \nThe show aired on Star One from 2004 to 2006 and not only got TRPs but was critically acclaimed as well.
