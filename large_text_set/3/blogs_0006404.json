Thankful to be alive, she stated the following: \nWe were sitting in the plane for what felt like almost an hour and about 40 minutes into waiting I received a call from a panicked friend and I had no clue what was going on. He let me know and then a few minutes later I saw the live feed that the person sitting in front of me was watching. \nIt’s a terrible crime, and I feel lucky that I wasn’t around that terminal during that time. I am praying for the families of the victims and those who I’m sure are completely traumatized by what happened today. \n*This article will be updated as information becomes available. \nRead more about the shooting in Spanish at AhoraMismo.com:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T15:29:27.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
