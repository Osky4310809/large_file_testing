He says the decrease would come from less state funding and declining enrollment. \nThe Joplin Globe reports that nine of the 18 districts using a four-day week adopted it for this year, when the state saw a $398 million gap between what the state's school funding formula called for and the money allocated to schools. \nMcCrackin said the plan would eliminate Monday classes and add 30 to 60 minutes of class time to each school day. After gathering public response, the district hopes to decide by February. \nThe East Newton district is situated southeast of Joplin.
