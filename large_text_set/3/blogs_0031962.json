But doing this you are guaranteed to give yourself a dull cup of tea,’ he told the Telegraph .\n‘You need freshly drawn water for a good cup because reboiling it takes out all the oxygen and nitrogen out of it.’\nMORE: Terraced house goes up in flames on London street \nIf you make bad tea it could be because you’re boiling the water too much (Picture: Getty Images) Now this looks like a great cuppa (Picture: Getty Images) He said the solution was to always add new water or re-heat cups of tea in the microwave instead.\nHe added: ‘A better solution is to put it in the microwave for 15 to 20 seconds.\n‘When you microwave tea all you’re doing is from a scientific point of view is just moving the molecules around and getting it back up to a decent temperature. It is not impacting the flavour at all.’\nSo if your tea was really bad, now you know what you were doing wrong.\nMORE: Facebook Messenger will stop working on certain smartphones this week \nMORE: ‘Sexist’ advert showing old man and young woman will be taken down after backlash ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:22:34.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
