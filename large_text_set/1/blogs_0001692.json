The \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 \nA few things jump out immediately: \nFirst, we are sure opposition members will feel the need to comment on Trump's revelation on the timing of the briefing ( was it confidential? ); \n\nSecond, the use of quotes around \"intelligence\" is a not so subtle stab at the current agencies (all 17 of them); \n\nThird, calling the hacking \"so-called\" makes it clear Trump remains unconvinced, and that is reinforced by the comment that they need more time to build the case; and \n\nFourth, describing the delay as \"very strange\" seesm to strongly implies 'CIA plot'. \nWe await the 'shock' from The White House at Trump's tweet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:46:49.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
