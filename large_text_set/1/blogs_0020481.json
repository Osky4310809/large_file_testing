That sounds more than a little terrifying, considering the fates of most teams who don’t have a franchise-level quarterback. The followup question didn’t elicit any more clarity: “I’m going to take some time and evaluate with my family and just do a lot of praying about it and make sure it’s the right thing for me and my family.” That’s an answer, yes, if only because it’s not the outright declaration that yes, Roethlisberger will be under center in 2017. \n  \nAfter a strong late-season run, the Steelers crumbled to powder against the Patriots. Le’Veon Bell lasted only 11 plays before going out with an injury, Antonio Brown was reportedly grumbling about not getting thrown the ball, and some of the younger players let   game get to them. “Guys have to understand that the game can’t be too big for guys, and I think it was for some guys,” Roethlisberger said. “And that’s ok, they’re going to have to learn.” \nRoethlisberger just finished the first year of a four-year, $87.4 million contract. He’s not slated to become a free agent until 2020. Perhaps this is just end-of-season frustration, or perhaps there’s more to it. Either way, Steelers fans are in for a nervous next few months.
