Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nChelsea are laughing their way to the title — and boss Antonio Conte is one of the big jokers in the Blues ' pack. \nThe Londoners are transformed under their new Italian manager and the proof is in their position and out on the pitch: Top of the league and six points clear on the back of a record-equalling 13-game winning run . \nStamford Bridge and the Chelsea camp are happy places again. \nIt is all a far cry from last season. \nJose Mourinho increasingly distanced himself from his squad during their turbulent and ill-fated title defence.

The atmosphere around Chelsea is much lighter than at the end of Mourinho's time (Photo: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty) \n\"That’s good for us, to have a manager who is not just a boss but like a person we can talk with, someone whose support we can count on in difficult moments. \n“He is calm with the players and you can see the people love him more all the time. \n“If you work hard and there’s not a good atmosphere, the work doesn’t mean a thing. You can run 20km, 80, 100, and if there’s no spirit between the players, the coaches, as colleagues, it won’t come out as well. \n“Work goes well if you give your best with the guy beside you.” \nCosta has benefited as much as anyone from Conte’s man-management. Costa was kicking and screaming as Chelsea won yet again on Saturday... (Photo: CameraSport via Getty) ...and boss Conte seemed quite pleased too! (Photo: AMA/Getty) \nHe is back to his best – he scored his 14th goal of the season in Saturday's 4-2 win over Stoke - and Conte has managed to get the feisty forward to channel his aggression and, largely, steer clear of the unnecessary controversy that had dogged him during his first two years in England. \nThe bond between the pair was there for all to see again as they shared a laugh and joke at full-time. \n“Diego is a good guy and for him it is important to joke. But when there is the moment to work, he works,\" said Conte. \n“He is a Brazilian [though he now plays for Spain]. He is always happy and he wants to show this. \n\"For us it is very important, when you have this type of player, keeping the atmosphere always electric, with good positivity.” \nWatch — Joker Diego Costa pranks Chelsea's sleeping physio: Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T00:53:40.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
