The truth is that the Nigerian legal system is corrupt,” he claimed. \nHolding up a plastic bottle containing contaminated water from his community in Nigeria, the tribal king said “my people are drinking this water”. \n“There are strange diseases in my community — skin diseases, people are dying sudden deaths, some people are impotent, low sperm count,” he added. \n“I can afford to buy water. But can I afford to buy for everybody? No.” \nSPDC claims that the main sources of pollution in Ogale and Bille are “crude oil theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining”. \nThe first claim was brought on behalf of 2,335 individuals from the Bille Kingdom, who are mostly fishermen who claim their environment has been blighted by oil spills. \nThe second claim was brought on behalf of the 40,000 members of the Ogale Community, who say they have suffered repeated oil spills since at least 1989. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T18:27:24.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
