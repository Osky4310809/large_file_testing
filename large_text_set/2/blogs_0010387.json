Let’s all take a moment to laugh at the Magic for turning Oladipo and the 11th pick in last year’s draft into Ross and a pick at the end of this year’s first round. The Magic will continue to be bad. Advertisement Advertisement \nAs for Ibaka, you probably haven’t thought about him much this season because he’s been having a down year and Orlando is the place where basketball goes to die. But it wasn’t that long ago that he was considered a key player on a championship contender, and he’s still just 27 years old. Maybe the chance to play for a winning team will help him wash off enough of the Magic’s stink that he’ll be able to help the backsliding Raptors get their shit together. ( They should still probably fire Dwane Casey. ) Recommended Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:54:57.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
