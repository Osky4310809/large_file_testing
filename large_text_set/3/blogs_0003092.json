The GT Concept’s powertrain is operable in three modes: pure EV mode, petrol engine only or hybrid with both drive sources in action. \nThe battery is recharged via brake energy regeneration, in addition to input from the internal combustion engine once the battery’s charge level has dropped below a pre-determined threshold. \nAs intimated earlier, the GT Concept is the second AMG model to receive the brand’s EQ Power+ designation after the W08 F1 racer . The new badging will also represent all of Mercedes-AMG’s future performance hybrids models. The branding is located on the GT Concept’s external rear view cameras, replacing normal mirrors. \nThe chance to showcase new possibilities in aesthetics hasn’t been foregone, and on the illumination front Mercedes-AMG employs ‘nano-active fibre technology’ on the GT Concept’s daytime running lights, as well as on its tail lamps. A flexible light cord lends the GT Concept a three-dimensional illumination effect, while a pair of tubular rod lights serve the DRL function in addition to the LED headlamp. \nContinuing along the rear end, the tail lamps employ the same technology, housed beneath the 3D lens of the rear lamp assemblies. As seen in earlier leaked images, the wide, pronounced carbon-fibre diffuser and centrally-mounted exhaust outlet builds upon the GT range’s visual identity, specifically from the GT R . \nThe motorsport connection is further made with application of carbon-fibre exterior components on its roof, front spoilers, rear diffuser and side sill panels. Stopping power for the GT Concept comes courtesy of an AMG-branded carbon-ceramic brake system, with calipers painted in bronze. \nAs a technology demonstrator concept cars so often take the role of, the GT Concept is the first of Daimler products to employ a modular battery pack that is scalable to suit specific applications, says Mercedes-AMG. With the GT Concept also being just the second EQ Power+ product, it can be taken as read that eletrification will feature in the company’s future products as a performance enhancer.
