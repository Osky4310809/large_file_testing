I have had several employees that had to be fired for using heroin this year. It seems like an epidemic,” said Dave Sims, of Bethel Park. \nPolice say they followed the car to a nearby gas station and initiated a traffic stop. That’s when officers say they saw Singer slide alleged stamp bags of heroin next to her seat. \nPolice searched the car and found packets of heroin, stamped with the words “The King,” which is the very drug that was the focus of their investigation. \n“They say it hits every socioeconomic group, every age bracket, every nationality,” said Dave Stanaec, of South Park.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:12:57.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
