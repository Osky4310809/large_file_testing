Inauguration crowd pictures made their way to the National Park Service Twitter account and a Senate confirmation hearing , among other places. \nConsidering he sent his press secretary out over the weekend to display pictures that showed a large audience at his ceremony, it was only natural that Trump took to his Twitter account to post one of his own. And earlier today, he did, sharing a panoramic image of the inauguration crowd. A photo delivered yesterday that will be displayed in the upper/lower press hall. Thank you Abbas! pic.twitter.com/Uzp0ivvRp0 \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2017 \nHowever, it appears there is one little mistake on the photo that was quickly noticed. Trump says he'll hang photo of inauguration crowd in press hall—but the date on the photo is Jan. 21 ( #WomensMarch ), not #Inauguration date. pic.twitter.com/k4UsslGKe6 \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) January 24, 2017 \nYes, the photographer, Abbas Shirmohammadi , placed an erroneous date on the photograph. Instead of it showing January 20th, it instead reads January 21st, the day after the inauguration. (The image is of the inauguration and not of the Women’s March, which occurred on the 21st.) \nAccording to The Hill , the photograph is now hanging in the press hallway that connects the White House communication staff’s workspace. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:45:47.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
