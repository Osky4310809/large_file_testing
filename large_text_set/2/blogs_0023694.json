Whether it’s making nature documentaries or aiding in Kylie Jenner’s secret career as a pop star, the man truly can’t be pinned down. Which is why it’s only mildly surprising that he’s now making techno, with his first-ever track making its debut last night. Give it a listen below. \nThe track, titled “Enter the Depths”, was written for Marvel’s latest Black Panther comic of all things. Written and produced entirely by The Based God, it is surprisingly a more minimal offering than one might have expected, but nonetheless hints at exciting new directions. This may be a preview of the kind of sounds we can expect from his long-teased Black Ken mixtape for instance, but only time will tell. \nStay tuned for Lil B’s highly-anticipated mixtape Black Ken to arrive shortly. Listen to one of its songs, the Metro Boomin-produced track “My House”, below. \nIn other music news, Thundercat has dropped a new track with Kendrick Lamar.
