(My favorite? A grandfather decked out in an over-the-top Minnie Mouse t-shirt, right in the middle of the #RockTheDots action!) The fashionista herself – yes, that would be the one-and-only Minnie Mouse – even made a few surprise appearances at the dance party at Disney Springs.\nI was lucky enough to snag a photo with her before she was whisked away for a costume change – over the course of the event, Minnie showcased four different polka-dotted looks, each one as cute as the one before … what I wouldn’t give for her wardrobe!\n\nCheck out a few fun photos from the Disney Springs event:\nUnfortunately, the rain put a damper on some of the elements originally planned for our friends on the West Coast, but I hear that those who showed up at the Downtown Disney District didn’t disappoint with their Minnie-inspired styles!\nDid you #RockTheDots? If so, I’d love to know what you enjoyed most, so feel free to share in the comments below.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:45:12.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
