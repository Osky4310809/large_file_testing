SIGN UP NOW > \nPerhaps blinded by the chance of a rare series victory in India, where they’ve won just once since 1969 but are currently locked one-win apiece in a gripping series, Australia have put Cummins’ future in jeopardy according to Lawson. \n“Cricket Australia have just ignored and gone against their own plan. And they’ve already broken Pat once last year by bringing him back too early,” a bemused Lawson told foxsports.com.au. \n“This is his third comeback from these stress fractures and they’ve picked him against the plan which has been intricately devised by a number of people, both at Cricket NSW and Cricket Australia. \n“The plan was not for him to be playing in this Test series — it was for him to be playing Sheffield Shield cricket and reassess him (at the end of the season). \n“From that point of view it’s Cricket Australia going against its own plans — we’re just hoping it turns out well.” Cummins a gamble worth taking 1:33 \nB OWLING RESTRICTIONS? YOU’RE KIDDING! \nSuggestions of Cummins being handed a reduced workload in India — such as being restricted to a certain number of overs per day, or per innings — were quickly shot down by Lawson, who took 180 wickets in 46 Tests for Australia. \nBut Lawson, who is an assistant coach and bowling coach at Cricket NSW and who has previously coached Pakistan, said it would be even more infuriating for Cummins should he not be picked in either the third Test, starting in Ranchi on Thursday, the final Test in Dharamsala. \n“You can’t! He’s playing Test cricket. It’s not a handicap event,” Lawson added. \n“You can’t say to him ‘mate, you’re going to play a Test match but you can only bowl 15 overs per innings’. \n“That’s not what Test cricket is about. You do all this preparation to be able to play tough, hard, grinding Test cricket. \n“But no one has said he’s playing the Test match yet — if he goes over there and sits on his backside it will be even more disappointing because he should be back here playing first class cricket. \n“If he played and (squad member and fellow fast bowler) Jackson Bird didn’t, I think Jackson would be entitled to be disappointed because he’s the next cab off the rank.” Pat Cummins has changed considerably since his Test debut in 2011. Source: AFP \nFROM A BOY TO A MAN \nCummins enjoyed an outstanding return to the Shield against South Australia last week, hitting top speed and moving the Dukes ball both ways. \nHe looked every bit the superstar who shredded the Proteas as a skinny 18-year-old, and left many salivating at the thought of him doing it on the big stage once again — ideally the Ashes this summer. \nCummins finished with four wickets in each innings as NSW recorded a healthy victory. \nLawson is encouraged by the development of Cummins physically and says he’s more capable than ever of surviving the harsh environment of Test cricket — but the fear of another injury looms large. \n“He is a much broader object, he’s stronger and he’s a bigger human being than he was then — it’s a much more mature body,” Lawson said. \n“And then you’re still only 23. That’s what you have to keep reminding people: Pat Cummins is 23. \n“That’s why we need to keep advocating patience on his comeback, because there’s plenty of time. \n“There’s plenty of time for Pat Cummins to peak at next year’s Ashes. \n“If he gets injured again this series, that’s almost wiping off another nine months. He won’t be playing the Ashes next year if he gets injured in this series.” Cummins should replace Starc 0:48 \nFREAK OF NATURE \nCummins’ NSW skipper, Moises Henriques, echoed the views of the team’s assistant coach and openly questioned whether the call-up was a wise one. \n“I think Pat is a very special bowler, so in terms of skill-wise and if you want someone to play cricket for Australia, I think Pat Cummins is your man,” Henriques said on Monday. \n“But whether he’s ready physically on the back of one Shield game, that’s a completely different kettle of fish. \n“There’s a number of different factors when it comes into selecting guys to play for Australia in those sorts of conditions. \n“It was only one Shield game earlier that he got ruled out and apparently he wasn’t ready to play Shield cricket for NSW. \n“Now on the back of one Shield game he’s ready to play a Test series in India, that’s their (the selectors) call. \n“Skill-wise, can he bowl at that level? 100 per cent he can. He’s a freak of nature.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T07:47:04.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
