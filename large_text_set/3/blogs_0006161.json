The question is whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks after the encounter Trump greeted Kislyak at a VIP reception last April 27. Three other ambassadors also were on hand. \nThe reception was hosted by the National Interest, a foreign policy magazine, and Trump stayed for about 5 minutes. Kislyak also attended the speech. \n“We have no recollection of who he may have shaken hands with at the reception and we were not responsible for inviting or vetting guests,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told AFP. \nMichael Flynn was forced to resign as Trump’s national security adviser last month after misrepresenting his contacts with Kislyak to Vice President Mike Pence. Sessions currently is under pressure because he flatly denied contacts with Kislyak during his confirmation hearing but has since admitted meeting with him twice during the campaign. \nOther Trump advisers also have been caught up in the controversy, including former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who was forced to resign, as well as J.D. Gordon and Carter Page. Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner also reportedly had contact with Kislyak. \nAt a February press conference , Trump denied any contact with Russia. \n“I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don’t speak to people from Russia,” he said, except for the two calls he has received from Russian President Vladimir Putin since the election.
