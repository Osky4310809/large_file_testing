The first ever Un'Goro card reveal livestream revealed 11 new cards to us from the upcoming expansion. Peter Whalen of the Hearthstone team and all-around-awesome-person Sean \"Day[9]\" Plott were on stream to present and talk about the cards. More cards will be shown starting next week. They confirmed some cards will be shown at the HCT Bahamas event. Quest cards can be counterspelled . Nether Portal does indeed spawn an imp every turn! Un'Goro Pack via Elise the Trailblazer doesn't mimic in-game packs. It has better chances for Legendaries and gives a guaranteed epic. \nFollow us on Twitter to get notified of new cards immediately!
