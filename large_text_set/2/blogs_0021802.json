It's difficult for me to call myself a feminist in the classic sense — because it seems to be very anti-male and it certainly seems to be very pro-abortion. I'm neither anti-male or pro-abortion. There's an individual feminism, if you will. You make your own choices. I look at myself as a product of my choices, not a victim of my circumstances. And to me, that's what conservative feminism is all about.\"\nSo, all liberal feminists are victims of their circumstances? In what world does fighting for equal rights make one a victim?

My mother never felt sorry for herself. She just figured it out. She didn't complain… I believe those are timeless lessons and timeless opportunities for all women in similar circumstances and situations.\"\nFighting for equal pay and opportunity isn't \"complaining,\" Kellyanne. Complaining is something President Trump does when he gets a tough question at a press conference .\nWe get it's hard justifying working for the biggest sausage fest in politics, but Trump's counselor really can't say being a conservative feminist is all about being a \"product of choices.\"\nBecause we're pretty sure the GOP is all about NOT giving women choices.\n[ Image via NBC . ] \nTags: conservative political action conference , donald trump , kellyanne conway , politik , qanda , sad sad", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:20:48.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
