At the time, Sessions told Horowitz’s audience that secularists are unfit to operate the government. The following is an excerpt from his remarks : \nUltimately, freedom of speech is about ascertaining the truth. And if you don’t believe there’s a truth, you don’t believe in truth, if you’re an utter secularist, then how do we operate this government? How can we form a democracy of the kind I think you and I believe in… I do believe that we are a nation that, without God, there is no truth, and it’s all about power, ideology, advancement, agenda, not doing the public service. \nCommenting on Sessions’ remarks, Michael Keegan, president of the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way, told The Daily Beast : \nIt goes against the values our country was founded on to intertwine religion and government in the way that Sessions described. The equality of every American, regardless of his or her religious beliefs or nonbelief, is one of the core principles of our democracy. If Jeff Sessions can’t understand that, he’s unfit to serve as attorney general. \nWriting for The Daily Beast , Jay Michaelson asks: \nIf Sessions believes that without God, there is no truth, and that secularists cannot “operate” the government, how will he discharge his duties to enforce the rule of (secular) law, investigate the truth or falsity of crucial allegations, and ensure that all people are treated equally? \nThere is no question that Sessions is a moral monster , with a terrible record on race, women, and the LGBT community. \nHowever, perhaps most alarming, Sessions is a radical Christian extremist who rejects the separation of church and state , and is not even sure if secular Americans understand the truth . \nAmericans United , the Freedom From Religion Foundation , and other sources report that Sessions believes the separation of church and state is an “extra-constitutional doctrine” and “a recent thing that is unhistorical and unconstitutional.” \nIn addition, Sessions is “not sure” if a secular person understand the truth as well as a religious person. At Sessions’ confirmation hearing earlier this week, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) asked the Attorney General nominee if he believes a secular person has the same understanding of the truth as a religious individual. \nSessions replied: \nWell, I’m not sure. \nSessions’ answer is unacceptable. \nBottom line: Sessions demonstrates a profound lack of respect and understanding for the U.S. Constitution, and the secular values intrinsic to the document. In addition, Sessions is a dangerous Christian extremist, with little or no respect for secular Americans. \nClearly Sessions is unfit to serve as attorney general. His failure to understand the separation of church and state, and his willingness to openly abuse and insult secular Americans, is reason enough to reject his nomination.
