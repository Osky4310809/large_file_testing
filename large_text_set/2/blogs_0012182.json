Published 10:14 PM, February 14, 2017 Updated 10:14 PM, February 14, 2017 \n  Rappler's civic engagement arm, MovePH, and the University of the Philippines (UP) University Student Council partnered for a fun and equally engaging #NotOnMyWatch booth at this year’s Valentine-week UP Fair. \nThe theme for this year’s anticipated fair “Sabayan Ang Beat” is a play of words. \"Sabayan\" means patronizing mainstream and indie original Pinoy music (OPM) while expressing one’s self. \"Sa Bayan,\" on one hand, means looking back at the advocacies uniting the university as a free community. \nThe official poster using the colors red, yellow, and blue, symbolize the most important beat of all – the beat for the people. \nHere's the line up of performances for Tuesday, February 14. \nHelp us fight corruption! \nThis same beat will be championed at the #NotOnMyWatch photo booth , a part of MovePH’s advocacy campaign to commend good governance, and to fight corrupt practices and activities in government agencies. \nUP Fair participants will be informed of MovePH’s anti-corruption movement and will be encouraged to contribute pledges to fight corruption. \nPledge participants will also have the chance to win smart phones and #NotOnMyWatch shirts. \n\"Hope in a Bottle\" will also be available for purchase at the booth. The funds will donated to help fund the construction and improvement of classrooms in various locations around the country. \nSee you at the UP Fair! – Rappler.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:15:43.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
