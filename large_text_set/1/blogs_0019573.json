Along with fighting to direct episodes of shows he loves like The Flash and Supergirl , he also cameos in the dumbest things. Case in point, the new Sabotage DLC map pack for Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare . \nAlong with four new maps -- Noir, Neon, Renaissance, and Dominion, which is a remake of Modern Warfare 2 's Afghan map -- Sabotage includes a new expansion to the zombie co-op mode, Rave in the Redwoods.  \nSet in the 90s and dripping in neon coolness, the new map includes the previously mentioned Smith cameo, the returning stars of Zombies in Spaceland (voiced by Seth Green, Sasheer Zamata, Jay Pharoah and Ike Barinholtz), and a new enemy named The Slasher. It's looking pretty damn neat. \nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare 's Sabotage DLC will release for Playstation 4 on January 31st, with an Xbox One and PC release to follow at a later date. It's included in the $50 USD season pass, but can also be purchased on its own for $15 USD. \nCall of Duty Zombies DLC Stars Kevin Smith and Lots of Neon [Gamespot]\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:47:36.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
