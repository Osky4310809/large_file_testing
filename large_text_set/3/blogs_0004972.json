The pictures are very clear.\" \nPhillip added: \"I suppose it doesn't help matters when you tweet saying 'If someone offered me a DVD deal I would jump at the chance'.\" Chanelle Hayes talks about her weight gain (Photo: ITV) \nDespite the intense questioning, Chanelle insisted that her weight gain was unintentional. \n\"With the amount of money I've spent on pizzas and doughnuts, even if I did make a DVD I don't think I could break even,\" she claimed. \nThese days Chanelle seems happier than ever with her new fuller figure but it hasn't always been the case. \nJust two years ago she admitted: \"If I carried on the way I was going, I could end up dead.\" \nChanelle credited the new man in her life for helping her body confidence - revealing he's a teacher called Ryan. \nThe pair met on Tinder, and while they haven't been dating for long, she admitted she's smitten.
