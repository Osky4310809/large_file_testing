Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty Images 5) Resurgent Swans riffing on Leicester’s pain \nHaving climbed out of the relegation zone by winning three of their five games since the arrival of Paul Clement, Swansea City must be enthused the prospect of entertaining a Leicester City side whose manager and senior players have acknowledged the tailspin from which they are struggling to extricate themselves. By contrast, Swansea’s players could scarcely appear more galvanised under, and united behind, Clement, who has quickly settled on his preferred starting XI with impressive results. Following the pick ‘n’ mix approaches of Francesco Guidolin and Bob Bradley, he has named the same side for Swansea’s past three games and they have yet to let him down. His forays into the transfer market have also proved astute, with Martin Olsson, Luciano Narsingh and Tom Carroll all impressing since their arrival at the Liberty Stadium. In further good news for Swans fans, the deadline-day acquisition Jordan Ayew has reported for duty upon his return from the Africa Cup of Nations, where he boosted his confidence after a patchy spell at Aston Villa with an absolute belter for Ghana against DR Congo. “For the past three or four years I have been all over the place,” he said, explaining a decision to move to Swansea that was influenced by his brother (and their former player) André. “I need stability and I think this is the perfect place for me to grow and improve in a lot of aspects. I think I made a wonderful choice.” Previously considered by many to be dead and buried, this corpse-turned-undertaker looks a good bet to lower the hapless reigning champions even further into the Premier League abyss. BG Relegation would not taint title win, it would add to the legend 6) Weakened Burnley aim to make home comforts count \nChelsea could have faced Burnley at a worse time. Sean Dyche has a decidedly slimline set of midfielders to pick from: Jeff Hendrick, sent off at Watford last week, is suspended while Dean Marney remains sidelined and Steven Defour is a major doubt. It means Ashley Westwood will probably partner Joey Barton for his first start since joining from Aston Villa, while on the left there could be an appearance for Robbie Brady; on paper that is not a bad bunch of options but they will need to hit the ground running quickly against the runaway leaders. In Burnley’s favour is that their home record is the third-best in the Premier League; they have won nine of their 13 games and that, given their catastrophic away return of one point from 11, is the sole reason for their impressive league position. It is quite a discrepancy and speaks of the fact that, regardless of the personnel involved, Turf Moor can generate the kind of atmosphere and intensity that put opponents on the back foot. This will be the biggest test yet of Burnley’s home comforts and Chelsea ought to be too strong – but it is exactly the kind of situation Dyche and company have revelled in over the past six months. NA Conte says ‘blind faith’ in methods is driving Chelsea title charge 7) Mings can only get better \nHaving endured the recall of loanee Nathan Aké to Chelsea and seen his second-string side get thumped by Millwall in the FA Cup, Eddie Howe tried to placate Bournemouth fans by pointing out the players thumped by the League One side were unlikely to be called upon for future Premier League games. Despite these reassurances, Tyrone Mings has since started and finished three of them, in which he has gone so far as to score one of the 11 goals his team have conceded. Of course he has not been singlehandedly culpable for his side’s defensive concerns, but if Mings has the necessary aptitude for playing English top-flight football he has thus far kept it well hidden. Alongside him in Bournemouth’s porous back four, Brad Smith, another veteran of the Millwall gubbing, has also completed two of the club’s four games since that grim afternoon at the Den. Howe was widely expected to draft in defensive cover in January, but recruited no one and actually loaned Marc Wilson out to West Brom. With his team shipping goals for fun, things are looking bleak for Bournemouth in both the long- and short-term. Their defence is low on confidence and quality, while the Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus is coming to town . Even if Howe did, as reported, enquire after Mamadou Sakho and Joe Gomez without success in January, his failure to identify and recruit additional defenders from somewhere – anywhere – in January already smacks a little of negligence. BG Guardiola’s ruthless past shows Agüero exit is not impossible 8) Saints need Gabbiadini to match Defoe effect \nThese are uncertain times for Southampton, who beat Leicester and Liverpool in January – along with plenty of others – but appear to be going nowhere fast and would be on the brink of trouble with a third consecutive league defeat. They have already lost six in seven and Sunderland, emboldened by a draw with Tottenham and that crushing 4-0 win at Crystal Palace, do not look ideal opponents at this stage. It is tightening up at the bottom and if Sunderland’s revival, which may be coming a couple of months earlier than normal, continues on Saturday they will be only five points behind Claude Puel’s side. While there was encouragement in a thumping debut finish by Manolo Gabbiadini in last weekend’s home loss to West Ham the presence of José Fonte in the opposition defence was another suggestion that the number of high-profile departures the Saints have had to absorb is becoming unsustainable. Gabbiadini may need to step up regularly to haul them up the table – no Southampton player bar the injured Charlie Austin has scored more than four goals in the league so far this season – and might take inspiration from the miracles Jermain Defoe is producing with Sunderland. Defoe, who scored two utterly trademark goals at Selhurst Park , has provided 14 of the Black Cats’ return of 24; with someone in anything like that kind of form, Southampton would be just fine. NA Manolo Gabbiadini faces off against Sunderland this weekend.

There the similarities end, as West Ham have conceded 12 more goals in a season of wild swings of form compared to West Brom’s slow and steady approach to points accumulation. With neither side in any real danger of qualifying for the Europa League or going down, it is difficult to make predictions about a game that could go either way. In West Bromwich they talk of little else but who – if anyone – will be forced to make way from the heart of Tony Pulis’s defence when Jonny Evans makes his imminent return from injury. A match with little or nothing else riding on it for either team involved ought to at least help the man make up his mind. BG Join AC Jimbo and co for the Football Weekly Extra podcast 10) We need to talk about Middlesbrough \nIf the Premier League was a party, Middlesbrough would arrive empty-handed and spend all night sulking in the kitchen. It seems quite an achievement for any team to plod this far through a season without making any sort of particularly good or bad impression on the wider public consciousness whatsoever, but Middlesbrough have somehow pulled it off. Their longest winning streak is one game. Their longest losing streak is three. They have beaten only one of the 14 teams above them in the table: Bournemouth, who are 14th. No team have scored fewer goals, but the nearest thing to a complete humiliation they’ve suffered has been a 3-0 defeat. Not one of their players has captured the public imagination for being particularly good or bad, while their highest scorer needs three more goals to hit double figures and only one of their players has been sent off. Perhaps most disappointingly, the nearest their manager – who learned his trade at the knee of José Mourinho – has come to generating any sort of entertaining controversy came when he levelled some mild criticism at his own team’s fans . Needless to say, he subsequently ruined it all by apologising. While Boro fans will almost certainly bristle at this rumination on the pointlessness of their team’s Premier League existence, they must surely have hoped for more upon securing promotion last season. Football is, after all, an entertainment business and they have been given precious little good or bad to stir the soul in this campaign. Indeed, looking ahead to their weekend match against Everton, perhaps the most remarkable thing about Middlesbrough is that there is absolutely nothing remarkable about them at all.
