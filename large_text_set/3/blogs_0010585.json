He said, “Nigeria places high premium on issues that border on security, as such, NIMASA as the designated authority for the ISPS Code implementation is leaving no stone unturned to achieve 100 per cent implementation of ISPS Code in Nigeria. This will guarantee the safety of vessels calling or leaving our ports.” \nHe went on, “There is no doubt that we are determined to get it right. We are determined to work with the United States Coast Guard to get it right, in order to ensure our ports are safe. As a country, we appreciate the importance of getting security right at our ports, jetties and terminals and that we are committed to it. We appeal to the USCG to continue in rendering necessary assistance to NIMASA, as the Agency is open to support and partnership from them. \nIn his remarks, Foster commended NIMASA for its strides in ensuring safety at the ports and expressed satisfaction with the infrastructure development as regarding ISPS Code implementation in the ports. “It appears the energy that NIMASA has at the ports is very tremendous, as seen in all the ports we visited in Lagos”.
