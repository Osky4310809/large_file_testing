Joe Penney for BuzzFeed News ID: 10454479 “People are stuck in their country, and in airports, and I feel like this is the only thing we can do for them,” said Adnan Alshabbi, standing in front of one three bodegas he closed in the Bronx on Thursday as part of the protest.\nAlshabbi, who came to the US in 1995 and became a citizen in 2001, said he emigrated to this country for freedom, and that the latest move from the president has put his community at unease.\n“Our kids were born and raised here,” Alshabbi said, while holding a sign he would later place on his closed storefront. “This is our country. We have nowhere else to go.”\nHe made this sign so his customers will know why the store is closed.\n— Talal Ansari (@TalalNAnsari) ID: 10453755 Shutting down\n— Talal Ansari (@TalalNAnsari) ID: 10452616 “You know how long it took me to be a citizen?” said Aziz, a Yemeni-American who runs the cash register inside Nadal Deli. Aziz, who didn’t want to provide his last name, said he had to buy locks to close the 24-hour store.\n“We’re not safe back there, and now we don’t feel safe here,” Aziz said. The civil war in Yemen means even citizens with passports and US visas or green cards struggle to make it out of the country, with many international flights suspended and chaotic conditions for people attempting to cross by land into neighboring Saudi Arabia. In addition, the lack of consular services at the US embassy in Yemen’s capitol, Sana’a, has required Yemenis with documentation to travel outside of the country to have their questions about immigration answered.\n“It took me 14 days to get here” Aziz said of his trip back to the US from Yemen in November 2016, when his crossing of the Saudi border was delayed. After being interviewed, Aziz asked what the words “ban” and “chaos” meant, saying that he had been hearing those words so often of late.\nIn Manhattan, at 137th street, Hussein Ghadsha was closing the doors of Golden Deli as the clock struck 12. Ghadsha, who is 33, has worked at the grocery store for seven years.\n“I work in this place, I don’t own it,” he said. “But I hope the strike lasts more than one day, and it should. People have to speak up — you can’t stay numb. This is something that has to happen until something happens.”\nSupporting our neighbors in Crown Heights ✊🏼 #BodegaStrike #NoBanNoWall\n— rory solomon (@rorys) ID: 10452592 After closing, Ghadsha got on the phone with teachers at his children’s school — he has a 16-year-old, 13-year-old, and 9-year-old — to make sure it was alright that they left classes early to attend a rally in downtown Brooklyn.\n“They understand,” he said, of both the teachers and customers. “It’s not about the business. Money is not everything, you know. Money comes and goes. This is about our values, equal rights.\n“For people to go through something like this, in this time, I’m sick to my stomach even thinking about it.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/827231048748658688", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/827201797748039680", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/827199448061181952"], "published": "2017-02-03T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:20:27.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
