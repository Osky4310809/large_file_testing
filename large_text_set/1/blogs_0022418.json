At the time we had a few guesses as to who the Oscar-nominated actor might be playing, and now Woody has confirmed that he will be playing Garris Shrike in the second Star Wars Story. Find out more about Garris Shrike, after the jump.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Variety/videos/10154223936297197/\nWhile doing press for his upcoming film Wilson at the Sundance Film Festival. Woody Harrelson was asked if he would be playing Garris Shrike in the Han Solo movie. The actor reluctantly confirmed the popular fan speculation, saying “yeah, I am.”\nAs I explained in my speculative piece last week , Shrike was essentially Han Solo’s entry point into a world of crime.\nGarris first appeared in A.C. Crispin ’s novel The Paradise Snare , (check out that beautiful Drew Struzan cover art above). The character was a bounty hunter-turned smuggler who raised the orphaned Han Solo as part of a group of children he used in confidence tricks and thefts, based aboard the decommissioned troopship Trader’s Luck in orbit over Corellia. Shrike rescued the young Han Solo from the streets, raised him, trained him, and “beat him profusely when aggravated.”\nWe’ve heard that the Han Solo movie will take place nearly a decade before the events of A New Hope, which seems to fit with the timeline of the novel. In the book, Solo had a confrontation with Shrike and fled the criminal’s ship. Shrike tracked Solo down years later after the massive bounty on the smuggler. If they stick to the Legends storyline, Harrelson will not only be a mentor for Solo but an antagonist.\nHarrelson has previously said that “I’m a mentor to Han but I’m also a bit of a criminal. I don’t think I should say much more than that because the Force is not allowing me.”\nThe yet-to-be-titled Han Solo film will hit theaters in 2018 (initially set for a Summer release date, now rumored for a December release). The second Star Wars anthology film stars Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo, as well as Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian and Emilia Clarke in an unknown role.
