Theresa May visited Donald Trump's White House last week (EPA) \nMr Trump signed an executive order on Friday which has halted all immigration to the US from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. \nA petition launched on Saturday by Graham Guest, from Leeds, which states that Mr Trump should be prevented from visiting the UK because it would “embarrass” the Queen, was well over 980,000 signatures early on Monday morning. \nMr Guest said he feared Mr Trump would use the state visit and accompanying photo opportunities with the Queen to bolster his image. Petition to ban Trump's UK visit passes 800,000 signatures \nHe said: \"A state visit legitimises his presidency and he will use the photo opportunities and being seen with the Queen to get re-elected. \n\"The wording in the petition is quite precise as I actually say that he should come here as the head of government to do government to government business. \n\"At the end of the day he is still the president and we've just got to live with that. But there's no reason why he should get all the pomp and publicity of a state visit.” \nAccording to the Parliament’s petition website, all submissions that attract more than 100,000 signatures will be considered for a Commons debate.
