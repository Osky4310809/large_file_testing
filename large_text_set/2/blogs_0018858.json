This achievement has made India the number one country in the world in terms of mobile data usage. Soon, Jio is likely to come up with various tariff plans which the Jio subscribers will have to pay to enjoy the unlimited data usage services. \nThe Jio Prime membership program incurs a one-time fee of Rs 99. Jio Prime Members can continue enjoying the unlimited benefits of JIO NEW YEAR OFFER until 31st March 2018. And if you are still not a Jio prime user, then in such a case easily switch your operator and become a Jio prime user. \nReliance Jio came into existence on September 1, 2016, giving a shock to various telecom players. Jio came up two smart features: \n1. Lowest 4G data at Rs 50/GB. Currently, 1 GB 4G data is free every day which can be further increased by taking booster packs. The booster packs have been priced at many different rates. A recharge of Rs 51 will get you 1 GB data extra each day which you can access at 4G speeds. Also, there is a Rs 301 pack where you can get 6GB of additional data for 28 days. Apart from that Jio had also made its foray in ISD networks and enables people to make international calls. \nThe network is now offering a new ISD combo pack for Rs 501, that will give its customers a balance of Rs 435 for making ISD calls. This offer is also valid for 28 days. Jio also offers 100 SMSes free per day, but if you want more you can recharge your number with Rs 20 which will give you a balance of Rs 175 for sending texts in India or abroad. Each SMS will cost you 85p in India and Rs 5 if you send it to an international number. \n2. Voice calls on Jio are free for life time. Other big telecom companies suffered a major setback after this offer was announced by Jio. \nYou may also watch: \nCustomers who do not want to change their number can also become a Jio prime user by following four steps: \nStep 1: You need to send a text message, writing ‘PORT’ from your mobile phone through the existing network to the central number for mobile number portability which is 1900. The message will be delivered to TRAI’s for verification and authentication. \nFor example: Write ‘PORT 9999 ’ in the message box and send to 1900. After sending, you will receive an SMS with a reference code of portability. \nStep 2: Android users need to download the Jio App bundle on your smartphone and then generate an offer code. \nStep 3: Buy a Jio SIM from any Reliance Digital Xpress and Reliance Digital Xpress mini stores by providing them with an eKYC verification through your Aadhar number and get a Jio SIM. You also need to provide the person assisting you with the reference code. \nStep 4: You need to make due payment of your old telecom provider and get your number ported to Reliance Jio. \nStep 5: After clearing your dues, you will receive an SMS of successful portability followed by various exciting Jio offers. \nAfter the portability is done, You are set to enjoy the 4G digital revolution from your existing phone. \nYou may also watch: \nIf you are not having a 4G-enabled phone, then also you need not have to worry.
