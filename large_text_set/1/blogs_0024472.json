Naomie Harris celebrated her Moonlight nomination with slicked, side-parted, pin-straight hair and glowing skin that kept the focus on her striped jumpsuit. A heavily dusted onyx gaze lent Kerry Washington’s hair length a modern feel, while Emily Blunt’s take on the behind-the-ear-tuck was rendered romantic by way of coppery lids and statement earrings. \nAlways the red carpet ingenue, Michelle Williams played off the abbreviated nature of her peroxide pixie with a metallic scarf wound once around her neck, the accessory offering a bridge between rose-tinted lips and light-catching Vuitton dress. Meanwhile, the fiercely feminine ruffles of Salma Hayek’s butter yellow Gucci gown found a pretty match in her mane of soft, side-swept waves. That same playful sense of ease was echoed by The Crown ’s Claire Foy, whose intricate Valentino dress paired seamlessly with a soft updo and face framing strands, proving that, while she may be new to the Hollywood scene, she’s off to a royal red carpet start.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T05:42:54.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
