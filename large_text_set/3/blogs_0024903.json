Joe McKeever Christian Blog and Commentary Why Pastors Need a Sense of Humor In Touch with Dr. Charles Stanley Encouragement for Today Daily Hope with Rick Warren SEE ALL DEVOTIONALS Joe McKeever Joe McKeever says he has written dozens of books, but has published none. That refers to the 1,000+ articles on various subjects ( prayer , leadership, church, pastors ) that can be found on his website -- joemckeever.com -- and which are reprinted by online publications everywhere. His articles appear in a number of textbooks and other collections. Retired from \"official\" ministry since the summer of 2009, Joe stays busy drawing a daily cartoon for Baptist Press (www.bpnews.net), as an adjunct professor at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, writing for Baptist MenOnline for the North American Mission Board, and preaching/drawing/etc for conventions and churches across America. Over a 42 year period, McKeever pastored 6 churches (the last three were the First Baptist Churches of Columbus, MS; Charlotte, NC; and Kenner, LA). Followed by 5 years as Director of Missions for the 135 SBC churches of metro New Orleans, during which hurricane katrina devastated the city and destroyed many churches. Joe is married to Margaret, the father of three adults, and the proud grandfather of eight terrific young people. He holds degrees from Birmingham-Southern College (History, 1962), and New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary (Masters in Church History, 1967, and Doctorate of Ministry in Evangelism, 1973). Joe's father was a coal miner who married a farmer's daughter. Carl and Lois McKeever, both of whom lived past 95 years of age, produced 6 children, with Joe and Ronnie being ministers. Joe grew up near Nauvoo, Alabama, and attended high school at Double Springs. Joe's life verse is Job 4:4, \"Your words have stood men on their feet.\" 2017 Mar 22", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T08:14:54.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
