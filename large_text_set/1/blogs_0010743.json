Marco Rubio in his questioning of Tillerson said since Duterte took office on June 30, police and vigilantes have killed about 6,200 people in the anti-drug war. \nRubio said Duterte himself bragged that when he was mayor of Davao he personally killed suspected criminals to encourage police to do the same, a claim Duterte’s aides have sought to play down as an exaggeration. \nWhen Rubio pressed Tillerson to state his view as to whether this was the right way to conduct an anti-drug campaign, the nominee pointed out that the US and the Philippines have a long-standing friendship. \n“I think it is important that we keep that in perspective, that long-standing friendship. We need to be sure they stay an ally,” Tillerson said.
