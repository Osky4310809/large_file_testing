ADVERTISEMENT \n“We could have been sitting in second place alone all this time. But it’s all behind us now,” Garcia said. \nThe Painters blew command against rock-solid San Miguel Beer last Jan. 13, going scoreless in the final 2:43 of regulation to lose a six-point lead and go down, 107-101, in overtime. \nHad they come out with a different result, the path to the second win-once incentive in the quarterfinals would have been smoother for the Painters, who are playing their first full conference under Garcia in six years after Yeng Guiao’s transfer to NLEX at the start of the season. \nInstead, Rain or Shine will have to grind out wins in their last three assignments if possible, with the most intriguing one to come on Jan. 29 when the Painters and the Batang Pier lock horns in a potential tie-breaking clash also at Cuneta. \n“I was already wondering that day (after the San Miguel loss) how they (Painters) would come out from a loss like that,” Garcia said. \n“But they showed me right away, in the first day of practice after that, that they are up to the task.” \nRaymond Almazan, a 6-foot-7 center out of Letran in the NCAA who churns out consistent double-double numbers for Garcia, will likely be out for the rest of the elimination round because of a leg injury.
