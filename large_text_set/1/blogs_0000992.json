Cole's 4 Your Eyez Only at Number Four, the Broadway cast recording of Hamilton at Number Five and Drake's Views at Number Six. \nTwo soundtracks also settled into the Top 10: Moana rose to Number Six while the Suicide Squad soundtrack jumped from Number 21 to Number 10 after a spell out of the Top 10. The Suicide Squad soundtrack's return can be credited to Twenty One Pilots; a la carte downloads and streams of the soundtrack's \"Heathens\" accounted for 14,000 track equivalent albums, or TEAs, of the disc's 42,000 total copies sold last week. \nTwenty One Pilots' Blurryface also returned to the Top 10, at Number Seven, as their breakout album was accompanied by the new MuteMath Sessions EP.
