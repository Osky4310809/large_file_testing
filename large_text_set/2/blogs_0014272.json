Though the two former Oklahoma City Thunder stars have mostly denied there are any hard feelings since Durant left for the Golden State Warriors last summer, the lead-up to the All-Star Game sure gave us plenty of examples to the contrary. \nFor starters, the All-Star lockers for both players are basically as far apart as possible. Dun, dun, dun! Kevin Durant's locker is on the opposite side of Russell Westbrook's! #TeamWest #NBAAllStar pic.twitter.com/ueMrdDhYyh \n— Tas Melas (@TasMelas) February 19, 2017 \nThen you have Westbrook and Durant nowhere near each other for the Western Conference team photo. \n— San Antonio Spurs (@spurs) February 20, 2017 \nAnd if that wasn’t enough, Westbrook opted to take his pregame warm-up shots by himself, away from the rest of the West players. Russ warming up by himself opposite of the rest of the West team. pic.twitter.com/CKm4TrtDtA \n— Alexis Morgan (@alexiskmorgan) February 20, 2017 \nBut one West All-Star decided to join Westbrook – former Thunder star sixth man James Harden, who spent his first three years in the league as a teammate of Westbrook and Durant. Russell Westbrook was practicing away from Kevin Durant and the other West All-Stars so James Harden joined him. pic.twitter.com/R095TCqEnV \n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) February 20, 2017 \nBut maybe all is not lost between Westbrook and Durant. The two did have some interaction during the layup line and some final warm-up jumpers. KD passed the ball to Russ in the layup line. \n— John Schuhmann (@johnschuhmann) February 20, 2017 More news: KD made a jumper. Russ rebounded it & gave it back to him. Shooting-around protocol trumps free agency beef. \n— John Schuhmann (@johnschuhmann) February 20, 2017 \nAll of this only heightens the anticipation regarding whether Warriors and Western Conference head coach Steve Kerr will play Durant and Westbrook on the floor together or if Kerr will opt to put the Warriors four All-Stars — Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green — on the floor at the same time with Westbrook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:16:28.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
