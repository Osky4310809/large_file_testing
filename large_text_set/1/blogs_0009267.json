(NBC / Golden Globes via YouTube) Amazon’s billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, is becoming a regular at Hollywood award ceremonies like tonight’s Golden Globes, and now he’s becoming an inspiration for the jokes as well.\nBezos is attending the free-wheeling festivities by virtue of the five TV nominations that Amazon Studios picked up this year, plus the accolades given to “Manchester by the Sea,” an Amazon-backed theatrical release that picked up five more nominations all by itself.\nOne of Amazon’s video productions, “Goliath,” was honored early in the evening with a best-actor award for Billy Bob Thornton’s portrayal of a washed-up lawyer trying to redeem himself.\nBut for Bezos, the biggest nod of the night may well be the joke that Golden Globes host Jimmy Fallon shot his way. After mentioning Amazon’s nominations, Fallon noted that Bezos was out in the audience.\n“He actually arrived yesterday, but there was no one around to sign for him,” said Fallon – making a sly reference to Amazon’s main line of business, package delivery.\nBezos, who was sitting at one of the head tables in the Beverly Hilton ballroom, laughed as loud as anyone.\nStay tuned for Amazon-centric updates from the Golden Globes.
