An anonymous reader quotes a Christian Science Monitor report on \"a bill that would essentially ban large-scale renewable energy\" in Wyoming. The new Wyoming bill would forbid utilities from using solar or wind sources for their electricity by 2019 , according to Inside Climate News... The bill would require utilities to use \"eligible resources\" to meet 95 percent of Wyoming's electricity needs in 2018, and all of its electricity needs in 2019. Those \" eligible resources \" are defined solely as coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, nuclear, oil, and individual net metering... Utility-scale wind and solar farms are not included in the bill's list of \"eligible resources,\" making it illegal for Wyoming utilities to use them in any way if the legislation passes. The bill calls for a fine of $10 per megawatt-hour of electricity from a renewable source to be slapped on Wyoming utilities that provide power from unapproved sources to in-state customers. The bill also prohibits utilities from raising rates to cover the cost of those penalties, though utilities wouldn't be penalized if they exported that energy to other states. But one local activist described it as 'talking-point' legislation , and even the bill's sponsor gives it only a 50% chance of passing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:49:13.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
