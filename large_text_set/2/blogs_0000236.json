So when this babysitter needed a snack, she got hilariously creative.\nClaudia Sorhaindo's 15-year-old niece J'Ann babysat her 2-month-old while the mother made a quick trip.\nNot wanting to let the baby out of her sight while she made a sandwich, J'Ann came up with an ingenious solution that might just have you saying \"Why didn't I think of that?\"\nSEE ALSO: Genius mom has the best way of sneaking out of her kid's nursery\n\"I couldn't help but laugh out loud and share the photo with her dad,\" Sorhaindo said in a message.\n\"I have a baby holder and I asked J'Ann why she didn't go to my house (which is next door) to get it,\" the mother explained. \"She said she was too hungry and it would take time to go get it the figure how to put it on, and by that time she could have made four sandwiches.\"\nHilarious as it is, the photo is significant to Sorhaindo for other reasons.\n\"The picture J'Ann took was to show me that she is making sure she is keeping an eye on Ava,\" the mother explained. \"Ava got her middle name from my baby girl Jenelle Pemberton. Jenelle passed away 3 months after giving birth on the island of St Croix.\"\n\"I get a little paranoid so don't like to leave Ava by herself,\" she said.\nIn the capable hands of her cousin, though, Sorhaindo is able to move beyond the fear and go about her life. \"[J'Ann] is the best,\" she divulged. \"She comes over every morning before going to school at 6 a.m. to kiss Ava good morning. When Ava was in my womb, J'Ann would listen to her heart beat with a stethoscope. She love Ava like it's her baby.\"\nAside from bringing joy to her life, J'Ann's little cousin might just have also inspired her next big career move.\nWith the help of her aunt, J'Ann started a GoFundMe to create the J'Pant, a garment inspired by the above picture that would \"help caregivers ... everywhere.\" Sorhaindo says the fund is to raise \"at least\" enough money to patent the product.\nJ'Pants for all.\nBONUS: Woman turns babies' medical helmets into adorable works of art", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Hz7SY5Dg.m3u8", "https://www.facebook.com/claudia.sorhaindo/posts/10154396055225735?pnref=story", "https://www.facebook.com/claudia.sorhaindo?fref=nf", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Hz7SY5Dg.jpg", "https://www.gofundme.com/for-baby-ava-pants"], "published": "2017-02-03T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:47:40.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
