New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: AMD Motherboards - VRM info database \nIn light of xd_1771's thread (here) , I (and xd) have decided to start making a list of AMD motherboards and their power phases. Can't find your board on the list? Submit it, and we might be able to add it!: \nNote 1: all un-heatsinked boards will support Enzotech MOS-C1 heatsinks \nHeatsinks referred to in spreadsheet: Enzotech MST-88 Note 2: Often when a board is advertised as 8+2, 16+2, etc, it often still uses 4 channels. There has been some controversy over the advertising of \"8+2\" phase boards since they are not true 8 channel designs. But, since 8+2 (with four channels), in *most* (read: not all), situations is much better than 4+1 (4 channels) we still decided to list them by their Phase count rather than their number of channels. Note 3: Please be aware that just because a board does not have something the \"recommended\" collumn does not necessarily mean it is a bad board. It can either mean no-data, or not-recommended. As there are hundreds of AMD motherboards, we do not have time to research every one. If you have a question about a particular board, make a thread, or post in this one. \nAM3+", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:37:56.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
