One, in particular, referred to Special Olympians using a derogatory term and questioned the need for the Special Olympics at all.\nI guarantee you that these athletes have more courage, compassion, brains and skill — actually more of every positive human quality than you\n“The Olympics are for the best athletes in the entire world to compete against each other to determine who is the best,” the individual wrote. “Having r—–s competing is doing the opposite!”\nSchwarzenegger posted his response just hours later, noting, “As evil and stupid as this comment is, I’m not going to delete it or ban you (yet) because it’s a teachable moment.”\nThe former Republican governor of California continued:\n“You have two possible paths ahead. Right now, I guarantee you that these athletes have more courage, compassion, brains and skill — actually more of every positive human quality than you.\n“So take their path — you could learn from them, and try to challenge yourself, to give back, to add something to the world. Or you can stay on your path, and keep being a sad pitiful jealous Internet troll who adds nothing to the world but mocks anyone who does out of small-minded jealousy.\nRelated Trump doesn’t believe Schwarzenegger left Celebrity Apprentice voluntarily: ‘He was fired’ Arnold Schwarzenegger compares Nickelback to U.S. Congress and herpes, Nickelback fights back “I know that all you really want is attention, so let me be clear. If you choose to keep going this way, no one will ever remember you.”\nThat the 69-year-old actor stood up to a hater is not a surprise. He’s fired back at critics before, including President Donald Trump, who in January blamed Schwarzenegger for the low ratings of The New Celebrity Apprentice, the latest version of reality show franchise originated by Trump.\n“Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got ‘swamped’ (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT,” Trump said in a tweet posted Jan. 6\nThis week, Schwarzenegger offered up a response.\n“Donald, the ratings are in, and you got swamped,” Schwarzenegger, who did not support Trump in the election last year, said in a video.\nSchwarzenegger was referring Trump’s sinking approval ratings, which had hit just 37 percent last weekend according to a Gallup poll.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:56:58.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
