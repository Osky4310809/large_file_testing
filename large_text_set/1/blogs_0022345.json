The messaging system will allow you to not only send text messages from one user to another, but also easily send images, video, and even sound files, arriving directly to the user that you are trying to communicate with. To make a phone call, the other user will also have to have the application installed on their computer. Once this is done, Line will notify you that your friend is now using the program and that you can call him without any cost. Line is a very interesting communications tool whose main problem is the enormous competition that it has with other similar programs. Although it offers great features, it doesnâ€™t have anything new or especially interesting to offer. Opinions about Line No opinions about Line . Be the first!
