This was the last period when demonstrators could march relatively freely in New York without being restricted by metal police barriers, and the last time photographers moved so freely among them. More than 100 images from those diverse demonstrations are gathered in a new exhibit called “Whose Streets? Our Streets!” at the Bronx Documentary Center , a nonprofit educational space and gallery co-founded in 2011 by Michael Kamber, who has photographed extensively for The New York Times. The exhibit, which features work by 38 photographers, will be on display until March 14, with a multimedia companion exhibit online .

On the other hand, she said, now any demonstrator with a cellphone can project images to the world almost as the events are happening. “It used to be, you’d show your contact sheets to a couple of your friends and that was it,” she said. “They’d rarely get seen.” She said she hoped the exhibition would inspire demonstrators (and photographers) in the coming era, but noted that a few photographers had been roughed up covering the recent presidential campaign, a rarity in her experience. “There’s a different vibe now,” said Ms. Handler, a former photo editor for The Village Voice. “I don’t think any of us was concerned about our safety photographing Operation Rescue or a Klan rally. Now, as tough as these photographers are, they’re scared. Of course, they’re going to go out and shoot still.” Photo Garment union members rally in Chinatown in support of Kaity Tong, the first Chinese American television news anchor, when she lost her contract at WABC-TV.
