Since then, the last 45 years of manned space travel have been limited to the Earth’s orbit. So this would be a spectacular feat for SpaceX and for the future of private spaceflight.\nThe launch date hasn’t been scheduled yet, but the flight will take off from an historical location: Cape Canaveral’s Pad 39A. Fittingly, this is the launch pad that was used by NASA for the Apollo program’s lunar missions.\nThe spacecraft that will power the historic journey is expected to be the Falcon Heavy rocket. At 5 million pounds of thrust, it’ll be the most powerful rocket since the Saturn V, with more than double the thrust of the next-largest rocket.\nThere’s space for up to seven astronauts inside the Crew Dragon.

With its development funded by NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, the Crew Dragon was originally intended to ferry astronauts between Earth and the International Space Station (ISS). Unmanned supply missions to the ISS using the Crew Dragon will begin later in 2017, with manned missions scheduled for mid-2018.\nWondering if you can redeem miles/points to travel to space? While there aren’t any options to our knowledge right now, Virgin Australia’s Velocity program gave Australian travelers a chance to win and then redeem 25 million points for a seat onboard the first Virgin Galactic space mission. Sadly — or perhaps wisely given the current delays with the Virgin Galactic spacecraft — the winner chose a shopping spree instead .\nFeatured image courtesy of Kevork Djansezian / Stringer via Getty Images. \nHow much would you pay — in points, miles or cash — for a trip around the moon? \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:16:25.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
