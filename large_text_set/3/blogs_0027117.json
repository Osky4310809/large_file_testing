He had visited the Seattle Seahawks and Jacksonville Jaguars as well before reaching a deal with the Vikings. Ultimately, the issue didn’t concern the Vikings enough to dissuade them from signing him last week. \nMurray scored a career-high 12 touchdowns last year with the Oakland Raiders and rushed for 788 yards in 14 games.
