The first to see it was this Redditor , who pointed out that, under under the \"Wildlife Programming\" section, is the name Corey Bunnell. \nDo we think the wildlife programmer is the one who made it so I can ride a bear? Just need to know where to send this fruit basket. (source) \nWith a bit of googling, said Redditor stumbled upon this forum post from all the way back in 2007, wherein a young man named Corey Bunnell asked for help getting to Japan so he could live his dream of — you guessed it — programming wildlife. \nNah, his actual dream was to make video games at Nintendo. No one dreams of programming wildlife. \nThe type of people who love wildlife hate programming, and vice versa. (source) \nAnd so, ten years later, Bunnell achieved his dream. And it clearly wasn't easy — in his forum post, Bunnell described all the hang-ups involved in getting over to Japan, including student loan bureaucracies and visa troubles. He does, however, mention his willingness to do whatever it takes to get to the Land of the Rising Sun, because his dream is \"to live in Japan and work for Nintendo as a game designer\". Bunnell goes on to say, \"I realize this is a very large goal but it has been my dream since I first played Mario.\" And according top Polygon , who spoke with a Nintendo employee, Bunnell has done it, as the wildlife programmer in Breath of the Wild is indeed the same person who wrote that forum post so long ago. It's a touching story, one of chasing a big dream and not giving up until it happened. We would all do well to be more like Corey Bunnell — if there's something you've been dreaming of doing, well then goddamn it, go do it! And I'm taking my own advice here. My dream has always been to ride a bear, and so I am off to ride a bear. . \nAh, here it is — a picture of me achieving my dreams. Also the last picture taken of me while I was alive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:28:39.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
