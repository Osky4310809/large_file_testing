Dogara, the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, and the Leader of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan, had paid Buhari a visit in London on Wednesday. On Thursday, the Speaker took to his Twitter handle, @YakubDogara, to say that the political leaders discussed national issues. He also stated that Buhari shared jokes with the visitors. But, Dogara failed to mention the particular national issues discussed or the topics of Buhari’s jokes. Some of his tweets were, “President is as fit as a fiddle. After burning national issues, it was all PMB’s vintage humorous jokes. I’m so elated he is as fit as a fiddle.” Dogara’s media aide, Mr. Turaki Hassan, also quoted the speaker in a statement as describing Buhari as “fit as a fiddle.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:02:32.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
