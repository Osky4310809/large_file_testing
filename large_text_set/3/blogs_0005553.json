It's time to cut a rug (or pillow) because Joanna Gaines' latest Magnolia Home collection just arrived this week at Pier 1 Imports. \nThe collection, which features textured throw pillows and area rugs, is available for purchase online right now, and will be popping up in Pier 1 stores starting April 17 (40 styles and assortments will be in store, with 110 options on the website). \nThe \"simple, fresh, and timeless\" collection is a collaboration with Loloi Rugs, Gaines' second collection with the brand. With 13 years of design experience, \"it came as no surprise that Joanna excelled during our design meetings—offering her keen point of view on each and every piece,\" Loloi says. \n\"We are delighted to bring this remarkable collection from Magnolia Home to Pier 1 Imports,\" said Cathy David, Executive Vice President of Merchandising. \"We hope this assortment of plush, durable fabrics and rustic wool blends will continue to inspire our customers to discover endless possibilities for their home.\" \nGaines has had a busy year; in 2016, Magnolia Home launched its first paint line, featuring 25 hand-picked colors (yes, one of the hues is called Shiplap). And just last month, they announced that the line was expanding to include chalk-style paint . Plus, along with husband Chip, they're still making over homes in Waco for HGTV's Fixer Upper (including this amazing houseboat transformation from this season). \nMagnolia Home isn't the only famous name to collaborate with Loloi recently; Ellen DeGeneres' ED brand debuted her own rug and pillow collection with the trade-direct company this year. The collection was first announced in October 2016 , and debuted at the Las Vegas and Atlanta markets in January—we can assume they'll start appearing in Loloi dealers and online stores over the next couple months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:58:30.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
