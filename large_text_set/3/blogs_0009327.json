He had such a joy for life that he’d love to communicate, both in his acting and in his personal life, It was a real privilege to be around him.” \nDespite making only one appearance in the television program, Hurt went on to reprise his character in a series of audio adventures from Big Finish. The fourth and final anthology, “Volume 4: Casualties of War,” launched early this month . \nLongtime friend and sometimes collaborator Jacqueline Pearce, who played high-ranking Time Lord Cardinal Ollistra in “The War Doctor” audio series, said Hurt’s passing “has created a gap in my life that cannot be filled by anyone else.” \n“I will always miss him, and I shall always be grateful for the friendship he showed me and the support he gave me,” she told Doctor Who Magazine . \nBBC\nCompanion, colleague, or acquaintance, it seems everyone has positive memories of the gravel-voiced star of stage and screen. \n“I only met him a handful of times, but I can confirm the other thing that everyone else has been saying about him: he was also incredibly nice,” Moffat said. “Now, nice doesn’t seem like much of [a] compliment, but you have to remember that this man was, quite rightly, worshiped by everyone he met. Worship has been known to go to people’s heads—but not John’s. \n“If a man can remain humble and kind and warm as the world basically genuflects around him, then that is no ordinary man,” the showrunner added. “The Doctor would be proud to be John Hurt—and for one very special day, he was.” \n(I’m not crying, you’re crying!) \nStream all of Doctor Who now for free with your Amazon Prime membership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T01:00:14.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
