It’s the fact that he said he was going to help me and then just went off with my phone. \n“Why didn’t he just take it instead of pretending? Now I wonder if he had followed me. And that makes me think it could have been much worse, I completely passed out.” Evie collapsed on the pavement in the early hours of Saturday morning (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nEvie was inside the bar with friends on Friday night when she began to struggle for breath. \nStepping outside for air, it spiralled into a full-blown asthma attack, which is when she realised her inhaler was inside. \nShe collapsed on the pavement and was out cold for five minutes before waking to see a number of people around her, and a man by her side. \nShe said: “The man picked up my phone and said he was going to call an ambulance, but when I looked back up he had gone with my phone.” \nWondering where she was, Evie’s friends joined her and helped look for her phone for 30 minutes - to no avail. \nSince the theft, Evie has checked her data and seen that phone calls have been made from her phone, and she has cancelled her contract. Incident happened outside Ark nightclub in Deansgate, Manchester (Photo: Google) \nA GMP spokesman confirmed they were called to Ark at 2.30am on Saturday morning to a woman whose phone was stolen while she suffered an asthma attack. \nThe man is described as white and in his twenties. \nAnyone with information should contact police on 101, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
