Just three of the 16 teams currently in a playoff spot have a negative rebound differential. \nThe C’s are fortunate to sit in second place in the Eastern Conference despite their struggles on the glass. \nThe Celtics have plenty of assets to dangle in the trade market to acquire a center. They own multiple first-round picks over the next few seasons, in addition to expiring contracts and many talented young players. \nA trade is possible, the C’s just need to find the right fit and a deal that doesn’t sacrifice the future of the club. \nThumbnail photo via Benny Sieu/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:49:30.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
