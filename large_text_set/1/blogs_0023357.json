Henson gave a fittingly inspiring and motivating speech on their behalf.\nThe awards show was as politically charged as you’d expect after the inauguration of a new president, especially one who many in the entertainment industry disagree with—and on a weekend when so many protesters across the country were, themselves, uniting to fight Donald Trump’s executive order on travel, immigration, and refugees.\n(image via screengrab)\nWant more stories like this?
