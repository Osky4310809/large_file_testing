ADVERTISEMENT \nUP assistant coach Rald Ricafort said the Lady Maroons have to play with a sense of urgency especially one slip could prove fatal for their Final Four hopes. \n“Their focus right now is on their own performance because these last three games are all crucial to our standing,” said Ricafort. “Our morale is slowly improving after we went 1-5 in the middle of our schedule. We’re in the process of regaining our confidence we lost in the losses.” \nUP played just eight players, including the libero, but six of those players managed to get into the score sheet and five finished in double figures. \nKathy Bersola, Isa Molde, and Diana Carlos all had 14 points to lead the Lady Maroons while Aiesha Gannaban and Marian Buitre had 13 and 12, respectively, \nJaja Santiago had 18 points to lead NU while Aiko Urdas had a dozen. \nUP was dominant in every scoring facet of the game outscoring NU in spikes, 42-25, 16-13 in blocks, and 14-8 in blocks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T15:56:30.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
