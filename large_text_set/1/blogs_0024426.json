You can improve all of your photos with just a few tweaks to the way you shoot. Advertisement \nIn this video, YouTuber and professional photographer Peter McKinnon shares the five easiest things you can do to improve the quality of your photos: Use angles: Take 10 extra seconds before you shoot to think about the best perspective for your subject. Move around a little and find an angle that looks more interesting that straight-on. Shoot through: Shoot your subject through a group of people, some foliage, or dangle something in front of the lens. Give the photo a little more depth and complexity. Think opposite: If everybody is taking photos from the same spot at the same angle, try something different. Shoot the subject from the other side, from up close, upside down, at a weird angle, etc. Find the light: Lighting is super important, so take some extra time to find the best light for your shot. Don’t settle. If the light isn’t good enough, consider coming back at a time when it is, or try to add your own. And never forget about golden hour. Framing: Use objects, people, and whatever else you can find to frame your subject and tell a story. Framing creates a more interesting dynamic and gives the photo atmosphere. \nA lot of this can be boiled to down to thinking before you shoot, but not many people realize how little is required to turn a boring shot into something eye-catching. It can be fun to fire off tons of point-and-shoot snapshots, but just a tiny amount of prep time can drastically improve almost every single photo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:03:58.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
