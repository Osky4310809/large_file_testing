His district includes the street.\nThe street attracts about 2 million tourists a year, with up to 17,000 people visiting each weekend by car or on foot during busy summer weekends.\n“There’s people climbing on roofs to take selfies, they’re walking down the middle of the street. They’re standing right at the bottom trying to get a selfie looking up the street,” said Jess Montejano, a spokesman for Farrell.\nThe San Francisco County Transportation Authority report envisions an electronic system to collect tolls and keep track of cars that have made reservations to travel Lombard Street on certain days at specific times. Residents who live on the street would be exempt.\nDriving the street without a reservation would cost motorists more, the report said.\nCalifornia state lawmakers and Gov. Jerry Brown would have to approve legislation authorizing San Francisco’s city government to assess a toll.\nState Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, will work on the proposal, Wiener’s office said.\nTolls are common in San Francisco and other U.S. cities for bridges and highways.\nThe transportation authority could find no other examples of U.S. cities levying street tolls.\n \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:01:45.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
