In Illinois, 43 people were admitted to intensive care units this past week. \n“The flu can really have disastrous consequences,” Dr. Foster noted. \nWhile the vaccine is a good match for this year’s virus, parents no longer have the flu mist option. And Dr. Foster fears that may have kept some parents away. \n“That was not available this year because it was found to not be nearly as effective as the traditional flu shot,” Dr. Foster said. “So that certainly discouraged a certain number of patients from getting the flu vaccine this year.” \nBut she wants parents to know that it’s not too late to vaccinate. \n“We’ve got plenty of flu season left, we have plenty of time to protect more kids.” \nYou can avoid spreading the virus by washing your hands often. Dr. Foster said that kids should wash their hands immediately after getting home from school. \nBut vaccination is the best way to avoid getting the flu.
