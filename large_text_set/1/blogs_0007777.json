In addition, using a drug that has already been tested in clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease provides a real opportunity to get this dental treatment quickly into clinics.” \nThe medication could also work on severely damaged or infected teeth by helping provide a natural way for patients to heal quickly and effectively. \nIn the past, if a tooth became damaged enough, it would need to be extracted and the patient would be fitted with a false tooth. \nHowever, this may provide an opportunity for many to keep their natural teeth and keep them in good working order. \nThe new medication would also reduce the need for repairing fillings should they become cracked or fall out, as this would no longer be an issue when regrown.
