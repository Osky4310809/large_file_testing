The team had a small prototype, but they said they wanted to see IMU installed in community spaces such as school lobbies. \nRelated: 11 Successful Kid Entrepreneurs Keeping Their Eyes on the Prize \nSarah O’Rourke, Autodesk’s youth audience strategist, says that these young inventors understand what so many adults forget about innovation -- to not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. \n“It’s important to try and try to fail,” O’Rourke told Entreprenuer . \"If you don’t, you never know. Things don’t have to be perfect. If something isn’t innate, people often give up. Push down those shackles. The key part is just to keep trying.” Nina Zipkin Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.
