I think when the games on the line and in a situation like that; I think you leave it up to a make or miss. Unfortunately, we came out on the short end of the call. -- Coach Fizdale On factors that led to breakdown in tonight's game… We didn’t necessarily contain the ball well tonight. I thought we battled. We didn’t shoot the ball well at all, but we crashed the glass hard. We fought our tails off. -- Coach Fizdale On getting response from players after huddle in the fourth quarter... Yeah, we got punched and was down almost double digits. It was starting to get a little ridiculous. The way we were forgetting our plays and coming out of time-out not running our sets that we were drawing up. This whole trip was a real disaster mentally for us. Really frustrating for me right now as a coach, because it’s not anything effort wise. Things that I really get ticked off at is the effort. The last three games I thought we really competed our tails off. -- Coach Fizdale On the level of frustration after losing fourth straight game… We’re frustrated, obviously. Each game is different, we’ve had good and bad games even in the losses. Tonight we had one we felt we should’ve won. We hate that it came down to free throws at the end of the game. So just one of those nights and we really need [the win], but now we have to refocus going home. -- Mike Conley On the level of frustration after losing fourth straight game… We’re frustrated, obviously. Each game is different, we’ve had good and bad games even in the losses. Tonight we had one we felt we should’ve won. We hate that it came down to free throws at the end of the game. So just one of those nights and we really need [the win], but now we have to refocus going home. -- Mike Conley On how this losing streak is different from the last… Yeah, in these games [on this losing streak] we’ve given ourselves opportunities to win. We’ve played some very good basketball for the most part and we’re just not getting it done at the end – not getting it done physically and mentally – we kind of have lapses and those are the key parts to games we’ve lost. Like I said before that, the five game losing streak, we were lost as a team at that point. That’s the difference, we’re not there anymore. We’re much better, we’re a team that knows who we are and we just have to find a way to get a win here down the stretch. -- Mike Conley", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:42:11.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
