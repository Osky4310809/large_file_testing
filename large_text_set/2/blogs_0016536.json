The children of one Packers fan – Bill Snyder – decided to honor their father’s passing by taking out a full-page ad in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last week to thank Favre and the Packers for bringing so much joy into their father’s life.

Sending condolences to the Bill Snyder family. I'm honored to have played a role in such a joyful memory of his life. Warmest regards -Brett \n— Brett Favre (@Favre4Official) February 20, 2017 \nFavre spent 16 of his 20-year career with the Packers, guiding them to victory in Super Bowl XXXI over the Patriots in 1997. The 11-time Pro Bowler finished his career as the all-time leader in a number of categories – including passing yards and touchdowns.
