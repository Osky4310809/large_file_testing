It is so moving to know there are so many of you who are wishing our sweet boy well, and who are rooting us on as a family,” she penned in an Instagram post shared Monday.

Nobody gets an award at the end of all of it for doing it the best or most perfect way. All that matters is how we make our children feel, how we feel about them, and how we feel about ourselves as parents,” 31-year-old Amurri Martino, who is married to Kyle Martino , continued. \nBut although the lifestyle blogger and daughter of Susan Sarandon has received words of encouragement and positivity since the post went live on Sunday, she has also been the recipient of criticism and judgement. \n“To those who have expressed judgement, cruelty, and criticism of me, my choices, or my fragility during this time- I’m not going to justify myself to you,” she wrote to critics in the post, and added, “But I sincerely wish that 2017 brings you enough self love and confidence that you no longer feel the need to tear down another person during their darkest moment. Peace, please. Xx EAM.” \nAlthough the traumatic night is one she will never forget, Amurri Martino, who can no longer handle anyone but herself taking care of her children, said that her son was not seriously injured. \n“Here’s the good part: by the grace of all of his many angels, and every God one cares to pray to, MAJOR IS FINE. Completely fine,” she wrote in the original post. “He has been healing well, hitting milestones , cooing, smiling, and generally showing us that he is and will be [okay] as he grows and develops.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:13:08.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
