He also met former first lady Michelle Obama in Illinois, not far from where she was born. \nIf the two House bills are passed and signed into law, state offices and schools would be closed on Aug. 4, Obama's birthday, and businesses would have the option to close. \nThe Senate bill, however, details plans for a commemorative day that would not mandate the closing of schools or offices. \nIf signed into law, the House legislation would mark the first time a living president was ever honored with a legal holiday in Illinois. It would also be the first new state holiday Illinois has seen in 40 years. \nThe two House bills were proposed by Representatives Andre Thapedi and Sonya Harper, both Democrats. \n\"He should be honored â€” he's basically an Illinoisan,\" Thapedi told reporters Monday. \nHarper added that she believes that the 44th president was one of the greatest of her lifetime and should therefore be afforded the honor of a state holiday.
