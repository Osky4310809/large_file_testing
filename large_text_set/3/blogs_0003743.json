The Tongchang-ri is home to the DPRK's Sohae Satellite Launching Station where a long-range rocket was launched in February last year following the nuclear detonation the previous month. \nJapan's top government spokesperson, Chief Cabinet Secretary confirmed the missile launch, saying four missiles were fired and three fell into Japan's exclusive economic zone. \nThe DPRK's missile launches came after Seoul and Washington kicked off the Foal Eagle field training exercise on March 1.
