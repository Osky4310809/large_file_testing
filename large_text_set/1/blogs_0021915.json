That is a shame.”\nConway went on to say that she holds the media to account for the threats she's been receiving, and described their stance against Trump as \"presumptive negativity.\"\nNormally, only the president, the vice president, their immediate families, and a few other top executive branch officials receive their own Secret Service detail, but Conway's situation is not without precedent.\nBarack Obama’s closest adviser, Valerie Jarrett, also received Secret Service protection at some point in 2009 and used them \"as a valet service,\" according to the Chicago Tribune's Michael Sneed. Sneed's Secret Service source told him Jarrett brought them with her everywhere, including on shopping trips, at the gym, at restaurants, and while visiting friends in Chicago.\n“The Secret Service is supposed to work off her official schedule, but she seems to put everything on the official schedule,” the source said.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/24/kellyanne-conway-gets-secret-service-protection-after-receiving-threatening-packages/", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-2W8DJDhuA", "http://nypost.com/2017/01/24/conway-gets-secret-service-protection-due-to-death-threats/", "http://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/whats-the-secret-to-valerie-jarretts-security-detail/"], "published": "2017-01-24T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:09:18.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
