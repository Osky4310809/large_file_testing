Some back baby mommas hate us We only learn half of the drama, other side crazy On behalf of Charlamagne, I'm sure he ain't trading sides Maybe I should meet Tomi Lahren, I'll Lauryn Hill her Train her, she miseducated anyway Prolly hate the color of my face I'm just a young black rapping-ass African Ain't never wanted to have it and now he has it his own way Lahren responded to the track on Twitter today, but she seemed less concerned with the criticism leveled against her than the pronunciation of her name. Listening back to the track, it's clear that Wale pronounces her name as \"Tammy Lauren,\" quite possibly as a means of disrespect towards Lahren, but she took it at face value either way. So if you're gonna put someone in a song...diss 'em.. perhaps get their fricken name right next time @Wale \nâ€” Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 4, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:34:21.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
