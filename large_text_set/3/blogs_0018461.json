How, you ask? Because Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” is getting the feature-length treatment with its own holiday movie. Rejoice!\nAnd okay, it’s not exactly a Hollywood production. Rather it’s an animated, made-for-TV movie for children based on an already-existing children’s book inspired by the song .\nMariah took to Twitter to announce the ~fabulous~ news herself this morning, posting a teaser of the new flick that (of course) includes her lounging on a couch decked out in some festive checkered footie pajamas .\nMy song is becoming a movie!

There is just one thing I need !” the singer quips in the promo, cuddled up with one of her sweet Jack Russel Terriers and the book. According to the press release, the film will be a CGI production that follows a young Mariah in her quest to get what she really wants for Christmas: a puppy named Princess (obviously).\nFor her wish to come true, she has to dog sit Jack, “a scraggly rascal of a dog; in fact, the worst dog in the country,” in order to prove that she’s up for the task. While her time with Jack wreaks havoc for Mariah and her family, we’re certain the holiday flick has a warm and fuzzy ending fitting any holiday classic.\nI am thrilled to be able to bring the story of my favorite Christmas song to new generations of families with my upcoming new animated movie, Mariah Carey’s All I Want For Christmas Is You.

And while it’s still a ways off before the holiday special is released, don’t worry about reserving tickets early or setting your DVRs.\nMariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You is coming straight to Blue Ray, DVD and On-Demand, which will better accommodate your holiday binge watching anyways.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:32:17.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
