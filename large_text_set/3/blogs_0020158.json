Dubbed the “colette edition”, this color variant of the device was made available via an exclusive sale at colette’s physical store in Paris. Naturally, the very limited nature of the sale and the geographical constraint meant that OnePlus fans from the rest of the world would have very little chance to lay their hands on this variant.\nTo remedy this situation, OnePlus is now releasing another black color variant to other parts of the world with the OnePlus 3T Midnight Black .\n\nOnePlus is teaming up with Hypebeast for an online sales event beginning from 4PM GMT on March 24 . Only 250 units of the Midnight Black will be made available for this initial sale.\nHowever, customers in North America and Europe will also be able to purchase the Midnight Black color variant on OnePlus.net . OnePlus mentions that the device will be available for a limited time “ at a later date “, though a specific time and date was not mentioned.\nThe OnePlus 3T Midnight Black 128GB version will retail for $479 / €479 / £439 in its respective region while supplies last.\n\nWill you be purchasing the OnePlus 3T Midnight Black? Would you like to see other color variants?
