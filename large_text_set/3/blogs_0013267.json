What Aaron didn't expect was for Adam to keep his promise in the most epic way possible. \"I had not seen my brother in a long time, since I moved to Dallas,\" Adam told POPSUGAR Moms. \"Over the last couple months I have been calling him on FaceTime to see when he was going to be on Spring break. I found out the date and bought a plane ticket.\"\nAdam kept his trip back home to Ohio under wraps in order to surprise his little brother. \"Aaron came out of the house to get groceries, and that's when he saw me.\" In the 45-second clip, Adam is seen waiting in the garage for Aaron. As soon as Aaron spots his older brother, a huge smile flashes across his face before he leaps in for a hug. \"Oh my God! He's here! He's here!\" Aaron shouts, while touching his older brother's face. \"This is real!\"\nRelated:\nHow Having a (Much) Younger Sibling Changed My Life\nAdam says the secretive plan worked out even better than he could have imagined. \"I thought he was going to be excited, but not like that,\" he said. Two days after posting the touching video to Twitter, the tweet had already gained over 18,000 retweets and 42,000 \"likes\". The sweet encounter ends with the two brothers performing an adorable handshake you just have to see for yourself.
