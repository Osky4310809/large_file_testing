And yes, shopping habits will now include diapers and pacifiers. \nBut in addition, the actor may not be traveling all around the world like he once used to. \n\"We decided to be much more responsible, to avoid the danger,\" George shared in Paris Match number 3536. \"I will not go to South Sudan anymore and in the Congo, Amal will no longer go to Iraq and she will avoid places where she knows she is not welcome.\" Photos \nAmal Clooney's Pregnancy Fashion W8 Media / Splash News \nHe continued, \"Before, I did not care, I would even say that there was a pretty exciting side to going where no reporter had ever been. We have the chance to live between three countries: Italy, America and England.\" \nOnce it's time for the twins to enroll in school, George knows that it will be time to \"choose where to settle.\" And while some fans of the couple may think these two are never together in the same place, it's just not the case. \n\"In the meantime, we will continue to move according to our respective schedules,\" he explained. \"People think we're never together, but we have not been separated for more than a week.\" \nAs anticipation grows for the couple to add parents to their resume, Amal was spotted out and about in London where she displayed her baby bump. \nIn her first public appearance since the pregnancy news was confirmed, the human-right lawyer sported a Stella McCartney coat as she left an office building. \n\"Amal looked healthy and relaxed,\" an eyewitness shared with E! News. \"[She] looked content, happy, radiant.\" TAGS/ George Clooney , Amal Clooney , Couples , Pregnancies , Celebrities , Top Stories Additional Privacy Statement Your information may be shared with other NBCUniversal businesses and used to better tailor our services and advertising to you.
