Don’t forget to plan a ride home! \nThe Department of Public Safety said there will be extra officers on DWI patrols this weekend, looking for drunk drivers. \nOver the last six years, five people died on St. Patrick’s Day due to drunk driving. \nIt’s the second leading holiday for DWI arrests per hour. \nLast year 189 people were arrested. \nEdina police tweeted Friday they had arrested five drunken or drugged drivers since midnight. Rough start to St. Paddy's. We have arrested five drunk or drugged drivers since midnight. Please be safe tonight. #StPatricksDay \n— Edina Police Dept (@EdinaPolice) March 17, 2017 \nIf you can’t find a designated driver, Metro Transit has your back. Rides on all Metro Transit routes — buses, METRO lines and Northstar — will be free from 6 p.m. Friday to 3 a.m. Saturday.
