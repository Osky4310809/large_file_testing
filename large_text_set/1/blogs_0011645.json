Advertisement \nIn this video, youtuber and photographer Peter McKinnon shares eight of his favorite photography tricks he uses in the field. Here’s a breakdown of what he demonstrates: Belt sling: Tie your belt around your camera for simple dolly shots and slick pans. Coffee hood: Use a coffee cup sleeve as an impromptu lens hood. Dream chap: Shoot dream-like photos and videos by drawing a circle of chap stick on your lens. Just be prepared to clean it off when you’re done. Cello-lens: Use some plastic wrap in front of your lens for a cool-looking effect. Shade blend: Use your sunglasses as an impromptu shade filter, or for artistic shade blend shots. Knife blade: Use the blade of a pocket knife to reflect light into your camera’s lens for an interesting reflection effect. Torch flare: Use a mini-flashlight—like you’d have on a key chain—to shine light into your camera’s aperture behind the lens. Smart flare: Use your smartphone’s flashlight for a gleaming flare effect. \nIf you’re a “point and shoot” type of photographer like me that’s looking to grow, these tips will come in handy. I’ll certainly keep them in mind the next time I’m out with my camera.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:15:48.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
