Just a couple of weeks ago we had informed you about the birthday bash his wife Mira Kapoor is throwing for him. Well, in case if you have forgotten, it’s happening tonight! And the who’s who of Bollywood is invited at their Juhu residence. We spotted Karan Johar, Sajid Nadiadwala, Manish Malhotra, Shahid’s rumoured ex Sonakshi Sinha, and his Padmavati co- star Deepika Padukone outside his residence today evening. The paparazzi also clicked Shahid and Mira who were all smiles for the shutterbugs. Sasha kept it casual in a pair of denims, a white tee and a white jacket. And Mira looked pretty in a beige coloured dress. How we wish we got to see a glimpse of their baby girl Misha too!

Right from the Rangoon team to the Bachchan parivaar; everyone is invited for Shahid’s 36th birthday bash. Considering Shahid Kapoor is on a strict regime for his body for Raja Rawal Ratan Singh for Padmavati, this already alcohol-free party will serve shots of celery, carrot, Kale, cucumber, kiwi! That’s not all – even the starters will be made of super foods, there will be salads, smoothies and guilt-free desserts! That’s so thoughtful of you, Mira! \nThe actor is battling flu and yet he is managing to promote his movie Rangoon as much as he can. the film hits the movie screens on February 24 and Shahid, along with his Rangoon co- stars Kangana Ranaut and Saif Ali Khan are on a promotional spree. Rangoon is directed by Vishal Bharadwaj. It’s a love triangle set against the backdrop of WWII. When asked about when he was resuming his shoot for Padmavati “All I know is at this point is that they are resuming shoot soon and I will be joining them next month. This month i will be only promoting Rangoon.” Published: February 19, 2017 8:30 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:06:13.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
