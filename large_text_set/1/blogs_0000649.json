The latest clip, the fourth in the series, offers glimpses of details, with gloss black hood vents/side mirror caps, vertical side vents and quad exhaust tips among the bits highlighted. \nSpyshot sets have of course revealed the general lines of the rear-wheel drive offering, which borrows design cues from the GT Concept from 2011 and sports a cab-backward profile and a liftback tailgate in the vein of the Audi A7 Sportback . \nThe latest video reveals the car will feature an automatic transmission, and though there’s still no firm hint of what’s under the bonnet, the new GT is expected to wear the 3.3 litre twin-turbo V6 already on offer on the Genesis G90 . \nWill it retain the 365 hp and 510 Nm seen in the latter, in Sport guise, or offer more in the way of output? It’s certainly fast – the very first teaser video showed the car doing 244 km/h on the Nurburgring Nordschleife. We’ll find out soon. \nGALLERY: Kia GT spyshots", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T05:43:14.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
