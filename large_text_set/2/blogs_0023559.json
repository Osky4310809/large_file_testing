He was just 64. \n“Just before John died he was actually getting together a special for us,” 74-year-old Challis told the Daily Star. “It was going to be Del Boy’s 65th birthday – for which everyone would meet at The Nag’s Head – and retirement.

We haven’t got a writer, if we had a good writer like the lovely John Sullivan, we would, I tell you. But my partner Nick (Lyndhurst) has gone on to other things, so you are stuck with Open All Hours.” \nLast year the BBC remade a string of old classics including Porridge and Are You Being Served?
