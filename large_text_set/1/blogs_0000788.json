Now, as a special little New Year’s treat, they have shared a song from the upcoming work titled “Say Something Loving.” Listen to it below via Spotify:\n\nThis is the second single from I See You following the critically-acclaimed “On Hold” which dropped in November. In the time since, they performed that song (along with some quaintly clunky choreography) for their debut performance on Saturday Night Live .\nI See You marks the first full-length from the band since their 2011 album Coexist . However, all three band members reunited on In Colour , 2015’s excellent solo album from their chief musical meister Jamie xx.\nLook out for I See You to drop next Friday, January 13, via Young Turks.\nRevisit the gorgeous music video for I See You ‘s lead single “On Hold” below.\n\nIn other music news, Lil Uzi Vert has shared a wile, anime-inspired music video for his single from last year “Ps & Qs.” Watch it right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T12:49:15.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
