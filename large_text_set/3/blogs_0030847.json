I looked after myself and liked dressing up. \n\"I spent money on myself and enjoyed going shopping. I felt the future was bright. I was in good mental health and felt strong. After the abuse my confidence was very low and I hid myself away from family and friends. \n\"He didn't like me socialising and I couldn't accept my friends' requests to go out. When she was at university she described herself as not being able to complete the work at home. Once we split it took months for me to get my self belief back and I am not back to the person I was before. \n\"It will take a long time to get back to how I was before. My education results got better after the split and I got a 2:1 and was able to qualify for my masters. I still find it very difficult to trust people. \n\"I can't see how I could trust another man again after what happened to me. I dreamt of being in a happy relationship and I do not feel now that that will ever happen with someone else.\" \nB ashir admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm but his lawyer said if he was spared prison he would be able to accept a place at Leicestershire, which has won the English county championship three times and produced a string of England stars including David Gower, Ray Illingworth and Peter Willey. \nPassing an 18 jail term suspended for two years Judge Mansell QC ordered Bashir to attend a workshop entitled \"building better relationships\" pay £1000 costs and banned him from contacting Miss Karim indefinitely under the terms of a restraining order. \nH e told Bashir: \"You told her how to spend her money and you tried to turn her against her family who you regularly insulted. She would buy clothes that were of a western style which you disapproved of and called her a slag and said her friends were 'English slag girls.' \n\"But I am not convinced she was a vulnerable person. Sometimes women who moved her from their country become trapped in a relationship where they lose their support network of family and friends and cannot speak the language. \n\"This is not the case her. She is plainly an intelligent woman with a network of friends and did go on to graduate university with a 2:1 and a masters - although this has had an ongoing affect on her. She has difficulty trusting people now, especially men.\" \nHe added: \"With regard to the mitigating factors I am not convinced of your remorse for her, but you are sorry for the position you find yourself in over the last two years. Your current partner is supporting you in court and she complains of no violence. You have employment prospects of being employed in cricket for Leicestershire Cricket Club. \n\"This court will not tolerate violence in a relationship of this nature. It is a very fine line between imprisonment and a suspended sentence.\" \nManchester Crown Court was told the pair met in their native Pakistan and married in 2013. But Bashir was said to be a \"controlling and dominating\" husband who told his wife what she could spend her money on and what she should wear, who she could see. \nT he couple had been on a day out to Rochdale Lake in April 2014 when an argument broke out about Bashir travelling to the Netherlands and he grabbed Ms Karim by her neck and was squeezing, until a member of the public threatened to go to the police. \nProsecutor Roger Brown said: \"The parties went back home where the argument continued. He grabbed her neck again, so much that she said it was hurting a lot and at one point he picked up a knife and said that he would kill himself and she begged him not to. \n\"He took her into the bathroom where he grabbed a bottle of bleach and he made her drink the bleach so she would kill herself. She spat that out as she was unable to swallow it. Then he gave her tablets from the house and told her to take them. She did but again she was unable to swallow them. \n\"He said to her 'I want you to kill yourself'. \n\"She did take photos of her injuries to her neck and to her upper arm. When making her statement she said that he grabbed her neck very hard and she thought she was going to die. She was pulling at him trying to get him to stop but he was stronger and she couldn't stop him. After that incident he left the house and she didn't see him for some two days.\" \nThe marriage continued but on New Years Eve 2014 the couple were at home when a row broke out about Miss Karim speaking on the phone in their living room. \nM r Brown added: \"She describes the defendant as becoming angry after she had been on the phone for just over half an hour, and after the conversation finished he took the phone off her and said she couldn't have it back and he wanted to search it and look at the messages. \n\"He slapped her so hard again that she fell on the floor and lost consciousness. The next thing she remembers is waking up on her bed, she went to get her phone but he was there. She said to him: 'it's over please leave me alone' but he called her a slag, and strangled her until she was struggling to breathe. \n\"He grabbed a cricket bat that was in the bedroom and her over the back with it. She recalls feeling a sharp pain. \n\"He said to her 'If I hit you with this bat with my full power then you would be dead'. He went into the hall and she took the opportunity to call 999.\" \nIn mitigation Bashir's lawyer Hugh McKee said of the couple's relationship: \"It had been going for some 10 years and during that time Mr Bashir was working in that time for long hours and having two jobs and she had no jobs. \n\"He says that he gave her money and got into debt to allow her to go on holiday with her friends. He struggled and continues to struggle and to this day he hasn't been able to give an explanation about what led him to do what he did. \n\"This was a relationship he wanted to keep alive but whatever she did or whatever he thought she was doing let him to lose his temper and to behave in the way described. He has continued to work, and he has a second job and potentially a very good job doing what he has always done - i.e. playing cricket.\" Share this article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T13:43:04.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
