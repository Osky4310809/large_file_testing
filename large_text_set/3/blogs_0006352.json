Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMichael Heseltine, who was sacked last night as a government advisor for joining the rebellion on the Brexit bill, revealed he has never met Theresa May. \nHe told the BBC this morning that he hasn’t met the Prime Minister, nor has he heard directly from Number 10 about his dismissal. \nThe former Deputy Prime Minister joined other Tory rebels to demand Parliament be given a veto over Mrs May’s final Brexit deal. \nThe Government was defeated by 366 votes to 268 in the House of Lords - the second defeat for Mrs May’s Brexit Bill in less than a week. \nLord Heseltine said he went for dinner with his wife after the vote, but was called back to the house by the chief whip. \nLord Heseltine had been advising the Department for Communities and Local Government on issues including infrastructure and industrial strategy before he was ditched last night. \nHe said this morning: \"[The chief whip] told me I was going to be sacked. Technically I haven't heard from Number 10. Though I suppose they'll get round to it. At the moment all I've got is the word of the Cheif Whip, and that's good enough for me.\" Baron Michael Heseltine (Photo: Getty) \nHe added: \"I heard nothing from Number 10, indeed I've had no relationship with Number 10 since the new Prime Minister, but I'm not complaining. I was getting on with the job that I was doing. \nAsked about the Prime Minister, he said: \"I've never met Theresa May, so I can't make a judgement [of her]. She's doing very well in the polls.\" \nLast night, he told the Press Association: \"I have just been told by the Chief Whip in the Lords that No 10 is to sack me from the five jobs with which I have been helping the Government following my vote in the House of Lords earlier today.

Lord Heseltine said he had been sacked from FIVE jobs with the government (Photo: WENN) \n\"However, in the last resort, I believe, as I said in the House of Lords, the future of this country is inextricably interwoven with our European friends. \n\"It's the duty of Parliament to assert its sovereignty in determining the legacy we leave to new generations of young people.\" \nLord Heseltine , a passionate pro-European, insisted he accepts the referendum result but said Parliament should still be given a final say once Mrs May has negotiated the post-Brexit deal. \n“In accepting the mandate to negotiate our withdrawal from the EU, I do not accept that the mandate runs for all time and in all circumstances,” he said. \n“The 48 per cent (who voted Remain) have the same right to be heard.” \nIn a fiery debate Lord Heseltine clashed with pro- Brexit colleagues from the Thatcher and Major eras as Tory peers were shown to be badly split. Theresa May suffered her second defeat on the bill (Photo: Getty) \nMichael Forsyth, the former Tory Scottish Secretary, claimed pro-Europe peers had a “hidden agenda” to try to block Brexit altogther. \nAnd he told Lord Heseltine it was “not the moment” to rewrite a Bill which waspassed unamended by the elected House of Commons last month. \n“I have the utmost respect for him, he helped get me elected in 1983,” Lord Forsyth said of his former Cabinet chum. \n“He has served the party with great distinction - but I have to say to him that it’s not the moment for this House to grab the mace and challenge the authority of the House of Commons.” Read More Theresa May dealt second humiliating House of Lords defeat over her Brexit Bill \nHe was referring to an infamous incident in 1976 when Lord Heseltine seized the mace from its position in the Commons during an angry dispute. \nTonight’s vote means the Brexit Bill will return to the House of Commons next week with two amendments - one guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals already in Britain, and another promising Parliament a veto on the final Brexit deal. \nBrexit Secretary David Davis said the Lords’ decision to rewrite the Bill was “disappointing and made clear the Government intends to overturn the result. \n“It is disappointing that the House of Lords has chosen to make further changes to a bill that the Commons passed without amendment,” he said. \n“It has a straightforward purpose - to enact the referendum result and allow the government to get on with negotiating a new partnership with the EU. \n“It is clear that some in the Lords would seek to frustrate that process, and it is the government’s intention to ensure that does not happen. We will now aim to overturn these amendments in the House of Commons.” \nBut Lib Dem peer Dick Newby, who leads the pro-EU party in the House of Lords, said it was right for Parliament to hold Mrs May to account over Brexit . \n“The Government must be held accountable as Theresa May drives the country towards a reckless, hard Brexit ,” Lord Newby said. \n“Theresa May has been offered a chance to think again.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T15:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T11:24:47.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
