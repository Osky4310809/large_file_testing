Instead, it prefers \"misrepresentative content.\"\nThe company recently edited a section of its advertising guidelines to reflect that wording.\nThe spokesperson said all of the sites in question were flagged specifically because of the rule change, though that wasn't necessarily why they were ultimately punished. The platform's policy also bars sites that engage in other nefarious activities like pornography, piracy and gambling.\nEach of the sites is now permanently forbidden from accessing Google's advertising service — a more serious penalty than the temporary blacklisting measure the platform often uses to enforce its rules.\nIncluding the bans, the company says it has disciplined a total of 340 publishers in some manner since November.\nThe report comes weeks after progressive watchdog group Media Matters accused Google of failing to act against 20 publishers it claims routinely broadcast hoaxes, conspiracy theories and other false stories.\nIn addition to the fake news crackdown, Google also said that it blocked 1.7 billion fraudulent ads last year — nearly twice as many as it did the previous year . Those included everything from weight loss scams and fake products to malware-laced pop-ups and phishing hoaxes.\nGoogle's decision to ban all ads from payday lenders last year was part of the reason for the uptick.\n\"A free and open web is a vital resource for people and businesses around the world. And ads play a key role in ensuring you have access to accurate, quality information online,\" Scott Spencer, Google's director of product management for sustainable ads, wrote in a blog post. \"But bad ads can ruin the online experience for everyone.\"\nBONUS: Google threw some not-so-subtle shade at Apple", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/LxALtc8P.m3u8", "https://blog.google/topics/ads/how-we-fought-bad-ads-sites-and-scammers-2016/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/LxALtc8P.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-26T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:58:37.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
