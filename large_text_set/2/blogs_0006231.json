Read more The MPs who voted against the £350 NHS amendment to the Brexit bill \nDoctors have warned of worsening conditions in overstretched NHS hospitals, said to be at breaking point due to overwhelming demand and bed shortages – with the number of patients on wards reportedly at unsafe levels at nine out of ten NHS trusts in England. \nThe target, introduced in 2004, states that 95 per cent of patients must be seen and either admitted or discharged in under four hours. \nBut the document suggests that of 1.4 million visits in January, only 82 per cent were dealt with within the time frame – while more than 60,000 people waited for up to 12 hours for a bed after being told they must be admitted, according to the BBC. \n“When social care isn’t available, patients experience delays in moving from hospital to appropriate ongoing care settings – preventing patients being admitted at the front end in A&E. These trolley waits are a desperate sign of a system under too much pressure,” said Mark Porter, chair of the BMA. \n“The government have so far failed to grasp the seriousness of the situation. The prime minister cannot continue to bury her head in the sand as care continues to worsen. Theresa May acknowledges incidents of 'unacceptable practice ' in NHS \n“The government must urgently look at the long-term funding, capacity and recruitment issues facing the system as a whole if we are to get to grips with the pressures the NHS faces year in, year out, but which are compounded during the winter months.” \nThe figures, compiled by regulator NHS Improvement, also reportedly suggest a record high for people waiting more than 12 hours for a bed after being seen in A&E. \nNHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told the broadcaster: “These figures have not been verified and should therefore be treated with caution, but they are in line with the feedback we have been getting from trusts. \n“NHS staff have responded magnificently to increased winter pressures, but the situation has become unsustainable.
