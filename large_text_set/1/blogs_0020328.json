The Undertaker hasn’t wrestled a match since Wrestlemania 32 , but he’s about to make his in-ring return during the WWE Royal Rumble. The big question is how much longer will The Deadman be able to continue wrestling even with his limited schedule for WWE? \nHeading into the WWE Royal Rumble , The Undertaker is a favorite to win the ‘Royal Rumble’ match. It has been reported that he will not be involved in a WWE World Championship match at Wrestlemania 33 . The chance of him winning the ‘Royal Rumble’ match seem less likely after that, but then the question becomes who will be the man to eliminate him because he may become Undertaker’s opponent for Wrestlemania. \nAccording to a report , Finn Balor, Samoa Joe, Braun Strowman, and others are rumored as the most likely to eliminate The Deadman from the match. In particular, Samoa Joe is the latest potential opponent for The Undertaker at Wrestlemania. No matter what WWE has planned for The Undertaker on the grandest stage of them all, those plans will be kaput if the latest report about The Undertaker’s health status turns out to be true. [Image by WWE] \nA few months back, it was reported that The Undertaker had undergone hip surgery after some pictures had leaked of him being seen on crutches. Immediately, the WWE Universe questioned what that meant for his WWE future and if Wrestlemania 33 was off the table for him. It wasn’t long before he made his return to SmackDown Live and it was revealed shortly afterward that he’s in good health following the hip surgery. \nHowever, it is now being reported The Undertaker’s hip surgery from a few months back is only a temporary fix that will likely get him through the matches he’ll have at the WWE Royal Rumble and Wrestlemania 33 PPVs. Eventually, The Undertaker will need to have full hip replacement surgery, but he’s trying to hold off the procedure until after he officially retires from wrestling. However, that may be sooner rather than later. \nClearly, The Undertaker is wrestling on borrowed time. The last thing anyone wants to see is to watch him suffer a career-ending injury inside a WWE ring just as Sting did almost two years ago. The WWE Universe would prefer not to remember the end of his career like that, but The Undertaker may have reached a point where the risks of being in the ring are not worth the financial gain or the glory to keep his wrestling career going. [Image by WWE] \nThere will always be another great match for The Undertaker to have at Wrestlemania. The WWE Universe is still hoping to see The Undertaker versus John Cena on the grandest stage of them all before the former hangs up his boots. Vince McMahon has canceled that match for Wrestlemania 33 , so it may never come to fruition if Orlando will be The Deadman’s last match. Regardless, father time will win the fight eventually. \nThe WWE Universe will always welcome The Undertaker back to WWE programming. In recent years, he’s mainly been featured during Wrestlemania season, yet he is still one of the most popular and talked about WWE Superstars all year. The bigger question is how many more matches does The Undertaker have left in his career before WWE if forced to make him retire or something more unfortunate happens in the ring. \nThe Undertaker ending his wrestling career is not an easy story to write, especially considering that WWE officials would want to sell and promote Wrestlemania as the end of his career. If not this year in Orlando, Wrestlemania 34 in New Orleans may be a good place to call it a career. It would be four years after the end of “The Streak,” and saying goodbye to the WWE Universe in the same arena sounds great on paper. \n[Featured Image by WWE]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:38:33.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
