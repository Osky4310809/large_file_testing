But I doubt she's talking retirement. \n\"She will be playing until the very last ball she can physically hit. Hopefully it won't be the last time I play her before she retires.\" 'I watch Konta a lot' Serena Williams can match her tally of seven Wimbledon titles with success in Melbourne \nSerena, in pursuit of her seventh Australian Open title, had only played two matches between the end of the US Open in August and her first-round victory in Melbourne. \nKonta, meanwhile, remained busy on tour and took her world ranking from 49 at the end of 2015 to a career-high of nine. \n\"I watch her game a lot. She's been doing really, really well, She has a very attacking game and I look forward to it,\" said Serena. \n\"I have absolutely nothing to lose in this tournament. Everything here is a bonus for me. Obviously I am here to win, and hopefully I can play better.\" Analysis \nEighteen-time Grand Slam winner Martina Navratilova \n\"The game is there for Konta. It's all about the head now. Inspired to play tennis? \nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide . \n\"It's a big ask when you've never played Serena Williams to beat her at a Grand Slam quarter-final but you never know. She's got the game to beat anyone. \n\"She needs to follow her game plan, believe in it and commit on every shot. If you have doubts then Serena eats you alive.\" \nFormer British number one Sam Smith \n\"I think Serena's looked great. There can't be any of these second-gear starts she had a few years ago. \n\"The match against Konta is another level. It will help Konta that she hasn't played her - there is no scar tissue. \n\"Serena wins her matches often in the first 15 seconds she strolls on to the court, but that's not going to happen with Jo.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T11:53:58.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
