(Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun) Wesley Case game, per my request. I settled in, expecting a relatively quiet night of slow sips, good music and a tight game between the Golden State Warriors and Oklahoma City Thunder .\nThe Warriors’ 16-point blowout denied the trifecta, but the rest made up for it, resulting in a nice evening in the county. \nAbove everything else, I liked Wits End’s commitment to its concept. The bar boasts online about having more than 50 kinds of whiskey, and Unger said that number is now closer to 75. They focus mainly on bourbons, Scotches and ryes, and charge reasonable prices for 2-ounce pours — like Four Roses Single Barrel bourbon for $11 and Filibuster Dual Cask Rye for $9. Read more stories \nWits End also carries rare and high-end whiskeys, including Pappy Van Winkle Special Reserve 12-Year bourbon and WhistlePig The Boss Hog – The Independent, a straight rye aged 14 years. \nFor a tiny Timonium bar attached to a comedy club, that kind of dedication to a spirit is commendable. Even better is the pricing: The elusive Pappy costs $27, while the WhistlePig (which can retail at $300) is Wits End’s most expensive pour at $52. Given the rarity and hype surrounding these products, ownership could have gauged prices, like other whiskey bars. But Unger said they don’t agree with the practice. \nWhile it’s nice for a whiskey bar to be discerning in how it stocks its shelves, it also requires a genuine enthusiasm from the staff to deliver a full experience. \nFrom chatting with a couple of bartenders that night, they made it clear they love whiskey, without ever seeming overzealous or pretentious. They had no problem answering questions on what they liked, what they didn’t and what they hadn’t tried yet. At no point did I feel I was being convinced to order a particular (read: expensive) product. \nInstead, as Paper Lace’s “The Night Chicago Died” played, a bartender casually pointed out a recent arrival he really enjoyed — the James E. Pepper 1776 Straight Rye Whiskey from Indiana. After discussing our experiences with Pappy Van Winkle, I expected him to suggest something pricey, but a pour of the 1776 was only $7, and it was a steal. With more than 90 percent rye in the whiskey’s mash, the result is a bold, spice-forward whiskey that local rye enthusiasts should appreciate. \nWits End also features cocktails (five winter options, and 11 “exclusive” offerings, though much of the latter was common items like a Moscow mule, negroni and a dark and stormy). A New York sour ($8) was made with Bulleit Rye whiskey, egg white, simple syrup, lemon juice and topped with red wine, and while the tartness stood out, other elements didn’t. The Old Fashioned Wit ($9) fared better, though it was essentially a standard, Bulleit Bourbon-based old fashioned with some extra cherries. \nI didn’t regret the choices — the cocktails were finished, don’t you worry — but I would have been better off exploring more whiskeys. Maybe I just ordered the wrong cocktails.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:24:19.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
