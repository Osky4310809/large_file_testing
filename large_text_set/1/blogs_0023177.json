The president's stated plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and to possibly levy a 20 percent import tax on the countries goods caused Mexco's president to cancel a planned White House visit and meeting with Trump. \nIn the speech, May also touted Britain's \"special relationship\" with the U.S. and all the fruit it has born. The United Nations, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and NATO, she said, were all products of the countries' long friendship and desire to build world peace — an ideal that stretches back to before the first World War. \n\"Some of these organizations are in need of reform and renewal to make them relevant to our needs today,\" May said. \"But we should be proud of the role our two nations — working in partnership — played in bringing them into being, and in bringing peace and prosperity to billions of people as a result.\" \nShe added that it was unacceptable and unfair for the U.S. to take the brunt of the security concerns on behalf of the world — a nod to concerns Trump raised on the campaign trail — but plainly stated that Britain has always met its defense commitments. \nMay detailed how much the U.K. spends on defense and overseas development as well as where the country has stationed troops.
