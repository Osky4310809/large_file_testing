We have always been asked to let go of the tiny, small things because apparently they don't matter. Each time you end up being a little picky about the food you want, or caring about the way you look, people start judging you. Fussy, materialistic, selfish... you've been called all of these until it becomes second nature to pretend to not care about things that really do matter. Because the world doesn't find it important enough, we end up functioning that way too, pretending that we don't care when we really do. However, the question is, why is it such a big deal to care about the little things that actually end up making you smile? If I take ten minutes extra to dress up and look good, why am I vain? If I want to eat or not eat a certain thing, how does that make me fussy? I care about these things as they define who I am, and I refuse to let go simply because you find them unimportant. 1. Caring about the way I look \nYes I will spend 10 extra minutes trying to match my shoes and my handbag, because I do want to look good. It's okay to want to present the best version of yourself to the world and if anyone thinks that that makes you shallow, well, that's their problem. 2. Holding on to your routine \nFor me, one of the most important things in the morning is to have a good cup of tea, made just the way I like it. If I don't get to do that one thing right, I feel like my whole day has started on the wrong note. If you have a morning routine, and if you are fussy about doing it just the way you want to, it's okay! 3. Office space \nYou are going to be spending more than half your day in this space, and it's important for you to set it up in a way that you feel the most comfortable. So if you want to spend a few extra minutes putting the books just the right way, or getting your computer to be at just the right height, do it. 4. Food \nYou love food, and you want it to be just right - how does that make you fussy in any way? Rather you are a perfectionist who wants to do things just right. 5. Keeping things your way \nBe it at work, or at home, you keep things a certain way and people coming and moving them around is just not done. I legit lose it if anything I own is moved, either at home or at work, and honestly I don't think it's wrong to be possessive of the way you keep your own things. 6. Quirky habits \nI have a friend who cannot deal with anyone eating even a biscuit in her car, as she believes that food will invite ants, I myself am super possessive about my books and I have to contemplate for days before I lend my books to anyone. We all have some quirky habit or the other, and to be told that they are silly or stupid by other people is just annoying. Let me hold on to my quirks, and you hold on to yours. 7. Me-Time \nFor me, Saturdays are my me-time days. I hate anything (expect for emergences) getting in the way, and I am super possessive about having a day all to myself. While most people cannot understand why I cancel plans just to sit at home, it's my way of de-stressing and if you can't understand it, not my problem again!
