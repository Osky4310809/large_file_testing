He attempted to swim away from it, but then it turned and started charging toward him. \nThe diver captured the scary encounter on video and shared it on his YouTube Channel called Liquid Vision : \nWith not much time to react, Daniel pointed his speargun straight toward the attacking bull shark, which opened its mouth as if it were going to take a bite out of the speargun or Daniel. \nIn an instant, Daniel plunged the spear into the bull shark’s mouth and the shark began to writhe. \n“He ripped the gun out of my hand, ripped the line off too,” Daniel told the Daily Mail Australia. “I didn’t realize the gun was stuck in his mouth so I was waiting for him to spit it out but then thought it wasn’t worth it and swum away.” \nHe did not know what ultimately happened to the shark. \nSeveral shark experts and spearfishermen told Daniel they had never seen that aggressive behavior before. \n“We’ve had reef sharks come up to us before,” he said. “They might take a fish off your line after you shoot it, but nothing like this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:52:47.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
