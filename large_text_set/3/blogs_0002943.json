Reporter is fooled by Sean Spicer parody, trashes Trump THEN deletes her account Posted at 12:03 pm   \nIt’s Sean SPICER … not Sean SPICIER. Just sayin’. \nIt all started with a goofy tweet from the fairly popular Sean Spicer parody account about #DayWithoutAWoman. The President will spend the #daywithoutawoman pretty much the same as the rest of us, in peace and quiet \n— Sean Spicier (@sean_spicier) March 7, 2017 \nOK, so Trump is fairly direct in his opinions and very rarely holds back even if what he’s saying isn’t exactly PC (heck, that’s what won him the election), but this is even far out for his administration. \nUnless you’re Carime Hernandez … \n— Sean Spicier (@sean_spicier)   SERIOUSLY?!   'Trumpcare' tweet \nWell apparently you can make this stuff up because the Sean Spicer parody account did. \nNotice, the original tweet is not included because it appears after finding out that she had engaged a parody she deleted her account. \nHrm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:11:52.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
