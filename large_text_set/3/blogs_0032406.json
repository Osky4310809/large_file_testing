His aide is also accused of using a non-profit entity to secure donations for Stockman’s campaign. \nStockman, 60, was formally indicted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) on counts related to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from charitable foundations on Tuesday. The two-term representative was arrested earlier this month while attempting to board a flight to the United Arab Emirates. \nStockman and his former director of special projects in his congressional office, Jason Posey, were charged in a 28-count indictment in federal court after Thomas Dodd, a former campaign worker and congressional special assistant, implicated the two as part of a plea deal for charges he faced. \nThe indictment claims that “ shortly after Stockman took office in the U.S.   in 2013, he and Dodd allegedly used the name of a nonprofit entity to solicit and receive a $350,000 charitable donation. ” '1930s-style gangsters': 7 police officers indicted and arrested on federal racketeering charges https://t.co/mgV1rDZWgT pic.twitter.com/pCl7UglOXb —   \nThat wasn’t the only time Stockman’s aides allegedly used unscrupulous methods to gain funds.
