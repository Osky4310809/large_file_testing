They gave a lethargic performance and the young France midfielder would not have declared himself fit for the encounter if he was to have his time again. \n“I played with a chest infection,” he said after PSG’s first home match since the debacle – a 2-1 win over Lyon on Sunday. “I wanted to play this game and it was not the best thing. Now I’m good, but I regret it because I was not 100 per cent. \n“Maybe we should have put someone else in my place. It’s clear I was in trouble, even if the outcome was not all because of that.” \nRabiot was on target for Unai Emery’s side against OL as he scored their equaliser after Alexandre Lacazette’s opener in Sunday’s clash. Julian Draxler got the winner before the break, keeping the defending champions within sight of leaders Monaco. ​", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:20:10.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
