Klopp wants Karius to prove himself — and would then be free to sell Mignolet (Photo: Getty) \nBut high-profile errors against Chelsea last Wednesday and then Hull three days later have forced Klopp to reconsider, and he is now ready to give Karius another chance... and hasten Mignolet's departure from Anfield. \nHis sale in the summer could finance a move for England No1 Joe Hart , although Liverpool have not so far considered the Manchester City star spending the season on loan at Torino as a target.
