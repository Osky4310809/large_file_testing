For that reason, many of those youngsters set aside their education in their early teens to try to make it to the major leagues and earn the kind of money that would make a huge difference in their families’ lives. But Rosario did not leave school early. His father, Germán Abad Rosario, was a criminal lawyer in the Dominican Republic and later a judge. His mother, Nerys Valdez Rosario, was a business administrator and, like her husband, has a college degree. “Education in my family is everything,” Rosario said. Rosario’s two older sisters are lawyers, and his youngest sister is in college. His parents told him that he could sign with a major league team, but only when high school was done. So soon after his graduation from Colegio Rosario in Santo Domingo in 2012, at the age of 16, Rosario signed with the Mets for $1.75 million, the most money they had ever given an international amateur. His father negotiated the deal. Speaking in Spanish recently after a workout at the Mets’ spring training facility, Rosario reflected on the dynamics of Dominican baseball and how they force youngsters to make big decisions at an early age. “Some youngsters — not all, but some — don’t have the opportunity to do both baseball and their studies,” he said. “Some come from humble backgrounds and have to support their families.” Some, he added, might not yet rate as big prospects but sign anyway so they can get at least a little bit of bonus money to help their families. \nAdvertisement   According to Rafael Perez, the director of Dominican operations for Major League Baseball, just 18 percent of the Dominican teenagers who signed with a major league team last year had completed high school — a rate, he said, not much different from that for the non-baseball-playing population.

His own parents did not attend college, but through soccer he landed a scholarship to Universidad Nacional Pedro Henriquez Ureña in Santo Domingo to study law. After practicing as a criminal lawyer, he became a judge. Rosario’s mother studied public administration at Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo. “Because of our professions, we know that education is ultimately very important, whether it be as a baseball player or doctor or whatever,” Rosario’s father said. “It’s important as a human being.” Like many youngsters in the Dominican Republic, an island nation of 10 million people that has produced the largest number of major leaguers outside the United States, Rosario became enraptured with baseball at a very young age. When he was just 3, he used half of a broomstick to hit kernels of corn tossed by his father in the backyard. When he improved his hand-eye coordination, he hit plastic balls in the field behind a nearby church and then graduated to real baseballs on a real field. He was still a little kid. At age 8, he joined a league called Liga la Javilla, where his father served as his main instructor. As Rosario grew bigger and began to display significant baseball skills, his parents had to draw a line. “Here, if a kid has talent, the parents take him out of school and have him study on Saturdays because he has a chance to make it,” Rosario’s father said. “But we thought that if what we were doing with Amed worked, then there wasn’t a need to take him out of school.” Photo Growing up in the Dominican Republic, Amed Rosario began his baseball training early, starting at age 3 by hitting corn kernels tossed by his father. So Rosario’s mother checked his homework daily. His father trained him on the field. Every evening after his father came home from court, the two would practice for several hours. After Rosario’s father left his position as a judge eight years ago, he dedicated more time to Rosario’s training. \nAdvertisement   Some notable major leaguers from the Dominican Republic did graduate from high school, including David Ortiz and Moises Alou. Some, like Albert Pujols and Jose Bautista, have continued their education in the United States. Others wanted to continue their studies, like Juan Lagares, a Mets outfielder, but couldn’t — because it got in the way of baseball. “Amed did well in doing both,” said Lagares, who signed with the Mets at 17. “I stopped studying to train. I reached only my third year of high school. I would have loved to finish but my situation wouldn’t allow it. I trained too far away from home. I couldn’t do both. For others, it’s because of money.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:47:27.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
