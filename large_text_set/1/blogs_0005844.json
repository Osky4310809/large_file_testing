The 35-year-old Dhoni under whom India had won two World Cups and a Champions Trophy title, stunned the cricket fraternity by relinquishing the captaincy barely 11 days before the ODI series against England.'Mahi' as he is fondly known started his journey in sports through football, turning out as a goalkeeper in his school team before switching gloves to cricket as a wicket-keeper batsman. Dhoni is a self-confessed Manchester United supporter and has been to Old Trafford twice during the Indian team's tours to England and Wales. The Red Devils came out with a tribute of their own via Twitter hailing Dhoni's achievements as captain of the Men in Blue. He is also the co-owner of Indian Super League (ISL) side Chennaiyin FC and has investments across various sports ranging from field hockey to superbike racing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T11:49:13.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
