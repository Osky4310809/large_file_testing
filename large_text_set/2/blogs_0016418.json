Ultimately, this is a situation that will be resolved in a court of law.” \nNot surprisingly, Nature’s Bakery in a statement Thursday had a different take on the suit. \n“Following months of negotiations, Nature’s Bakery recently notified SHR that it could not continue the partnership due to several commercial and contractual issues during the 2016 race season,” the statement read in part. \n“Nature’s Bakery is aware of SHR’s media campaign and recent false legal complaint. Those actions appear to have damaged SHR’s own business and unnecessarily drawn attention to SHR driver Danica Patrick. Contrary to SHR statements, Nature’s Bakery remains a healthy and vibrant company.” \nThe statement also quoted Nature’s Bakery CEO Kelly Allin. \n“Contrary to its image, SHR is run by big-business types that took advantage of Nature’s Bakery. They now are threatening scorched earth litigation against a multi-generational family company,” said Allin. “We’re obviously not going to let them bully us. We may be a small brand, but we do not think what they are doing is right. We look forward to defending ourselves in court.” \nAnd it looks like they will have that opportunity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:12:55.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
