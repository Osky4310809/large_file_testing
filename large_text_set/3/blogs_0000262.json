We certainly wouldn't! \nReality star Tom Morgan looks amazing in his first ever modelling job for men's clothing company Jacamo. \nThe 27-year-old, who has Asperger's and Tourette's syndromes, stole the nation's hearts when he appeared on The Undateables . \nThe Channel 4 programme aims to help people with physical and mental disabilities to find love. \nAnd when handsome Tom turned up on the show, people could barely believe that the sweet, attractive lad had trouble finding a date.

It's not landed him his first ever modelling job. \nIn a series of gorgeous snaps, rugby-playing Tom models suits, T-shirts, and jackets for menswear retailer Jacamo. \nHe said: \"I was pretty nervous as I’ve never done anything like this before, but it was great fun and modelling is definitely something I’d like to do more of. It was also a nice change from spending the day on a muddy rugby pitch! \n\"The Jacamo shoot has allowed me to continue to promote that, no matter what battles we may face, confidence is about being comfortable in your own skin.\" Do you think he's 'Undateable'? (Photo: Jacamo) He's hoping this will lead to more modelling jobs (Photo: Jacamo) \nThe company promotes self-confidence and inclusivity for all men, and is also a size specialist retailer catering for men of all body shapes and sizes from small to 5XL, coming in handy with Tom’s rugby player physique and 6ft 2 height. \nHe added: \"I enjoy wearing nice clothes and feeling smart but often find it hard to find anything that fits so Jacamo was perfect for this – even the jeans fitted over my thighs.\" \nAside from playing rugby, Tom is dedicated to raising awareness of his conditions, and helping others who also suffer. He has recently set up a charity, Mentoring Plus UK. He is also an ambassador for the National Autistic Society and State of Mind Rugby Union.
