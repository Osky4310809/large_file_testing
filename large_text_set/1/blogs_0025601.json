Not just the old football media but the regular media too. \nIn the old days \nHere is the news………Over here, if you want them, we might have some opinions about said news. \nThese days they are blended up into being the same thing. I just want the news and that’s it. I’m fully capable of thinking about the topic and forming my own opinion all on my own. Now days even “the facts” are highly debatable. nufcedmcgreevey says: Jan 31, 2017 9:13 AM \nGood ell, the emporer with no clothes, is as corrupt and un American as they come.

The league is going to continue its downward spiral of ratings and attendance and cities are not going to allow the NFL to use their names outside of their city limits any longer. \nIt is kind of ironic that the league’s ratings are dropping universally but they are limiting access. Very Trumpesque! Jan 31, 2017 9:19 AM \nThe NFL giving Barstool outlaw status is a blessing to Portnoy. bullcharger says: Jan 31, 2017 9:22 AM \nWhen I became an NFL fan as a kid is was to watch great athletes play a great sport. I didn’t care about who the commissioner was. I still don’t care. Goodell should not be such an important figure in the NFL from a fans perspective. He should be almost invisible.

I hadn’t even heard of them until this, but will definitely give them some clicks. Brilliant PR move once again NFL! harrisonhits2 says: Jan 31, 2017 9:27 AM \n“The Ideal Gas “Law” is FakeScience, so I don’t blame the NFL.” \nDouble facepalm. \nI advise you go buy yourself an official NFL football. Included in the instructions is a statement that the ball can lose pressure in cold weather. \nNot to mention that all over the country in cold weather states, people have been getting low tire pressure alerts due to, you got it, cold weather. Mine has been coming on every 2 weeks like clockwork. \nThe only thing fake is the league manufacturing deflategate. You show only how poorly educated you are with that statement. mjsully123 says: Jan 31, 2017 9:28 AM \nRay Lewis going to be there? Got forbid they ban people for a “sit-in” at NFL headquarters, but allow someone who, more probable than not, hindered a murder investigation.

Because some of the their employees were arrested during a peaceful sit in almost 2 years ago? But that site had credentials last year when NE wasn’t in the SB? But it’s about that May 2015 arrest and not the Fire Goodell shirt one of them was wearing on radio row? Seems legit… SupZo! says: Jan 31, 2017 9:41 AM \nIronic the credentials were pulled in time to prevent them from appearing on radio row…they protested the “Commissioner in Chief” aver a year ago… Jan 31, 2017 9:51 AM \ngreenlargo \nThe two judges were right though.
