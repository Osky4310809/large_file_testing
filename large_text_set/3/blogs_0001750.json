I said that sooner or later, the goals will come and I think we were very, very clinical on Sunday. \nMkhitaryan thanks Man Utd fans \n\"Sometimes, the badge wins games and this was an example of that.\" \nHerrera’s battling display in the middle of the park helped United over the line, and the Spain international is delighted to have got his hands on more major silverware. \nHe added: \"It's a very nice feeling. Our second trophy of the season, my third with the club and all that's happened to me in this stadium [Wembley] has been brilliant. Our fans have another trophy for our brilliant history so everything is good.\" \n\"I think one of the things [Jose] Mourinho has brought to this club is he is a winner. He shared that with the group, with the team and with the squad. \nPogba attacked by angry Man Utd fans \n\"At this moment, it's not very easy to beat us. We have to respect every opponent but the badge sometimes wins the game. We keep going. It's our second title of the season but it's not enough for us. \n\"We are not having too much time to enjoy it with our people. We are playing every week now but have two days off as the manager understands perfectly what we need. \n\"Already, we have to focus on Bournemouth [Saturday's visitors to Old Trafford] as we have to be in the top four. We want to play in the Champions League next season.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:52:37.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
