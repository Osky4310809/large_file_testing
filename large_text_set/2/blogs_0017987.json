A lengthy post, written by Kristen Marrone, who says she was in a relationship with Bass, appeared on Bass’s Facebook page on the night of February 16. It read in part: \nA few days ago Nicole got very sick. She was brought into the hospital and they did everything they could to help her. I have been sitting here with her in the room 24/7 since she got here making sure she was being given the best possible care. Today we learned that there is nothing else that can be done. \nNicole was an amazing woman. Strong not only on the outside but inside as well. Beautiful soul and kind heart. Many people knew Nicole but few ever got close enough to know the REAL woman that she was. I got to be one of the lucky few. Not only was she my soul mate and my girlfriend but she was my best friend, my teacher and my business partner. \nI learned many valuable things from her and created many beautiful memories in the time we had together. I would like to keep her page open for her loving fans and friends to share their photos and memories. I just ask that you treat Nicole with the dignity and respect that she deserves. \nThank you to everyone that has been reaching out to and helping me through this very difficult time. \nNicole, I love you. I will always love you. A few hours before Bass’s death, Kristen Marone posted this photo to Facebook appearing to show the two together. The caption read, “My babez.” (Facebook) \nBass was last in the public eye in August 2016 when she made an appearance on Howard Stern. During the show, Bass made a plea to strip club owners to hire her as a dancer. Bass was also asked about the passing of fellow former WWE female performer Chyna. Bass said, “Chyna was a c***. It’s like when people pit you against each other … I got where she was coming from.” She also said that her previous boyfriend had beaten her up and the pair had broken up. I'm sad to have learned of the passing of Nicole Bass. Rest in peace! Gone too soon! \n— Brian Heffron (@BlueMeanieBWO) February 17, 2017 \nIn May 2013, Bass’s husband of 28 years, Bob Fuchs, died after suffering a heart attack. Bass’s girlfriend, Kristen Merrone, posted this to Facebook: (Facebook) \nOn February 2, Bass wrote in a Facebook post that Marrone was her “girlfriend and business partner, and my best friend.” The two operated a business called “Nicole Bass and Zeddy Krueger.” The two offered video chat for $200 but exclaim that not sex or nudity is allowed. The service provided is domination or “fantasy wrestling.” \nWhile in June 2016, Bass was arrested for stealing groceries worth $1400 in Queens, reported the New York Post. While in 2006, Bass was hospitalized after suffering steroid-related problems in her pancreas. R.I.P. Nicole Bass. \n— Rob Van Dam (@TherealRVD) February 17, 2017 \nAfter abruptly leaving the WWE in 1999, Bass filed suit against the corporation. Bass alleged that she had been sexually harassed by Steve “the Brooklyn Brawler” Lombardi on a flight to London, England. She also said that it was commonplace for male talent to just walk into female wrestler’s locker rooms. The case was thrown out in 2003. The last report on the proceedings came in 2010 when Bass attempted to appeal the ruling. \nDuring the suit, Triple H and Vince McMahon both testified against Bass. Linda McMahon said after the case was dismissed, “I regret the lawsuit, and it never would have happened if we hadn’t hired her.” While Steve Lombardi said, “I don’t feel tarnished at all. Look who made the allegations.” \nBass though, claimed a victory saying, “I stood up for women. I stood up to a huge corporation. I stuck to my guns. It was very much an ordeal for me, to have to go through this process,” via PW Torch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:07:19.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
