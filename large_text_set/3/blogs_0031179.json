Expansion in Geismar \nH ard hats bob across vast expanses of metal at Shell’s plant in Geismar. Water trucks weave between installations, spraying down dust from the construction. A 255-foot distillation tower lays on its side, preparing for erection, looking like a tamed missile. \nShell is in the middle of a $717 million expansion in Geismar, adding a fourth unit to turn ethylene into alpha olefins, which are used to make lubricants, detergents, drilling fluids and a host of other products. The ethylene is piped from two Shell crackers — one in Norco, La., some 40 miles down the Mississippi River, and the other in Convent, La., to the west. It has 2,300 people onsite, though they’re hardly visible next to the hulking machinery on this 800-acre campus. \nIn Beaver County, the cracker and the units that process the ethylene into other materials will be on the same campus. Shell’s Geismar operation makes nine different liquid products, which are loaded on barges, railcars and trucks. The Beaver plant will make plastic pellets and several byproducts that will be put on trains and trucks. Ethane's journey from the ground to plastic From the wellhead to the cracker \nNatural gas extracted at multiple drill sites; transported through interconnecting pipelines to fractionation facilities. Step 2 - Natural gas liquid fractionation \nNatural gas liquids (NGLs) removed; ethane separated from the NGLs through fractionation; ethane transported through pipelines to cracking facility. Step 3 - Ethane cracker \nEthane arrives by pipeline to cracker plant; ethane converted to ethylene, then to polyethyene. Processed at Shell's petrochemical plant Step 1 - Cracking furnace \nEthane enters furnace and is heated to nearly 1,500°F. Ethane is cracked and reformed into a range of other molecules consisting primarily of ethylene, methane and hydrogen. Step 2 - Distillation \nThe cracked byproduct is routed to distillation columns. Ethylene is separated from other hydrocarbons. Step 3 - Polymerization \nEthylene is compressed and cooled before entering a polymerization reactor, to which catalysts are added. Reacted ethylene gas becomes polyethylene. Step 4 - Pellets \nPolyethylene is extruded into strings and cut into pellets. Step 5 - Storage, shipment \nPellets are stored onsite and eventually shipped by truck and train. \nRoyal Dutch Shell has done a lot of soul searching in the past several years, after oil prices took a hit in 2014. \nIt pulled back on natural gas development, for example, after some less than stellar results. It abandoned plans for liquefied natural gas facilities and Arctic exploration, often after hundreds of millions of dollars had already been spent. \nBut it has greenlighted several petrochemical projects, including the Beaver County project and Geismar’s AO4. \nChemicals are Shell’s “go forward strategy,\" said Alan Collins, the Geismar expansion manager, and this site is considered one of the company’s gems. \nThe Geismar expansion project is so huge it has its own monthly newsletter (TigerTimes), its own wellness coordinator (Emily Wong), its own mascot (a beefy-looking tiger in a yellow hard hat), and a “visual experience” on the Aurasma App. \nShale gas — cheap and plentiful — attracted Shell to Beaver County and it is behind the expansion at Geismar and dozens of other plants on the Gulf Coast. \nAscension Parish swings the way the industry swings and, while times have not been good for oil and gas companies since their commodities tanked a few years ago, the chemical companies that use those products have made a calculation that prices will stay low and supply will be there for the long run. \nAnd so, with support from state subsidies, the companies have announced billions of dollars in expansion projects. \nGary Rowan, vice president for corporate development for Methanex, which recently built a $1 billion methanol plant in Geismar, told the New Orleans Times Picayune in 2012 that Louisiana’s eagerness to help the project along was extraordinary. \n“I was surprised by the support they gave,” Mr. Rowan told the newspaper. “Boy, are they ever cooperative. They are out there to do anything to help you.” The psychology of Ascension Cows graze on grass that Shell rents to a cattle farmer on the grounds of its 800-acre Geismar complex. The psychology of Ascension \nI n the tiny waiting room in front of Ascension Parish Sheriff Jeff Wiley’s office hangs a 40-year-old map showing all the chemical plants squeezed together along both sides of the Mississippi River — a reminder of his largest taxpayers and biggest public safety responsibility. A map hanging outside of Sheriff Jeff Wiley's office shows what Geismar looked like 40 years ago. (Click to enlarge) \n“Let me tell you briefly about the psychology of Ascension,” Mr. Wiley said. \nHe described a place where chemical companies listen to and help the residents. And when they don’t, Mr. Wiley sets them straight. \nThen he paused to offer a “preemptive strike.” \n“We don’t just fling open our doors without any scrutiny,” he said. “There is some concern about what they’re doing to air and water,” both of which have improved substantially over the decades, he said. \nThe worst thing that can happen to a plant is for there to be an accident and for the people of the community to feel like they’re not being told the truth about what happened, Mr. Wiley said. \nThen come the fears and accusations, that the company is poisoning the water, that it’s releasing chemicals into the air and keeping it mum. That, too, is part of Geismar’s history. \nAs others in Ascension Parish do, Mr. Wiley framed it as a matter of trust and communication rather than a perfect record. \n“Things being human, there are missteps,” he said. Advertisement Advertisement Following the money Ascension Parish Sheriff Jeff Wiley is the tax collector and parish protector. Both roles bring him close to the region’s 32 chemical plants. Following the money \nA Louisiana sheriff is also a parish tax collector, and the chemical industry keeps his office well supplied, Mr. Wiley said. Questions from beaver County What kind of tax revenue will the plant create? \nShell alone has paid upwards of $8 million a year over the past three years, he said. However much of that goes to his office, schools get four times that, Mr. Wiley added, which allowed a segue into a topic that nearly everyone in Ascension Parish likes to boast about. Its schools are among the top in the state. \nThere have been some tough years in Ascension, Mr. Wiley admitted. Having a budget that relies heavily on the success of a single industry, and a volatile one at that, has given the parish some big setbacks. \nEven new projects and expansions come at a certain cost to the budget. For decades, Louisiana has offered a 10-year exemption on property taxes for new industrial facilities and those undertaking capital projects. Technically, it’s a five-year program with a five-year renewal, but both initial tax forgiveness and the renewal was “relatively automatic,” Mr. Wiley said. \n“If you fit this criteria, there wasn’t much vetting,” he said. And there wasn’t much that local entities could do. \nA taxpayer advocacy group called Louisiana Together calculated last year that the value of that forgiveness over the past 10 years was $16.3 billion, with $1.3 billion of that being “forgiven” by Ascension. “You build a plant here. Welcome aboard. Please be clean and friendly.” \nAll states give tax subsidies to corporations, the group argued. In fact, Shell received an incentive package estimated to be worth $1.65 billion to locate in Beaver County, and that includes 15 years of tax forgiveness for local and state levies because it located in a Keystone Opportunity Expansion Zone. \nBut those local Pennsylvania entities losing out had to give their approval for the tax breaks. They did so while getting Shell to commit to payments in lieu of taxes. \nIn Louisiana, a state body would approve the tax breaks, which impact parishes, municipalities and school boards, without their input. \n“All of us said, that’s what you do,” Mr. Wiley said with a shrug. “You build a plant here. Welcome aboard. Please be clean and friendly.” \nBut even in Louisiana, that attitude is changing. During the last legislative session, the state legislature passed a bill requiring local entities to sign off on the tax breaks. The buffer zone A worker walks under piping at the Shell Chemicals Geismar plant which will soon be the world’s largest producer of alpha olefins. The buffer zone \nI t can’t be overstated what a difference a few thousand feet makes when it comes to chemical plants. \nIn Geismar, the neat brick home of Sam Baker is one of the closest to a chemical plant, at just about half a mile. He can see the metal towers from his backyard, can hear the roar of steam being released at times, but it’s nothing like Norco, where homes are just a few hundred feet from Shell’s chemical complex there. Sam Baker’s home is one of the closest to a chemical plant, at about half a mile. Mr. Baker was among the first to build trust between the chemical industry and Geismar’s residents, a relationship he boasts is now better than it has ever been. \nMr. Wiley said the chemical plants were smart to buy buffer zones to separate from the community, but those are shrinking in recent years as the Louisiana parish expands and as commercial and residential subdivisions are springing up closer to industrial facilities. \nHe regards it as a symptom of the industry’s own success: people feel so comfortable being close to these plants that they’re building homes on the buffer zone. (Even the sheriff’s office has built a training center, shooting and firing range on 105 acres of buffer property most of it donated by BASF. Mr. Wiley sees it as a way to find use for the land so it doesn’t get developed more broadly.) \nFor years, Mr. Baker couldn’t hear the noise coming from the plants. \n“There was probably 600 feet of wooded area,” he said, standing in his backyard, pointing toward a grass field with Air Products stacks in its skyline. \n“At times you can hear it — the stacks up there now. It’s a loud roar of pressure being released,” he said. “At night, you’ll see the flares.” \nA developer from another parish bought the land and cleared the trees that had served as a buffer, Mr. Baker said, preparing to plop a commercial center on the former sound barrier. \n“We’ve become a working project in action,” Mr. Baker said. \nAre you enjoying this special report?

Advice from Louisiana: How to stay safe near a chemical plant The sun rises over the Shell Chemicals Geismar plant. Advice from Louisiana: How to stay safe near a chemical plant Listen for the sirens \nI n Louisiana’s Ascension Parish, where there are 32 chemical plants, the area’s 26 sirens are tested each Monday at noon. If a siren is heard at any other time, it means there has been a chemical release that has wandered outside a plant’s fence line. Questions from beaver County Would you move away from the plant if you had more money? \nIt might mean you should close your windows and turn off the ventilation system until the threat subsides, or you might be told to evacuate. \nSeveral TV networks will broadcast instructions, and an emergency call center may be activated to make individual calls to residents. \nA team of sheriff deputies may embed in residential communities with hand-held air monitors to determine which chemicals are detected and at what concentrations. \nCody Melancon, captain of administrative services at the sheriff’s office, said there’s an average of one unusual event a week at the plants and about nine area emergencies a year, which might require sirens to sound. \nThe last time there was a general emergency — the highest level there is — was in June 2013 when an overpressured vessel burst at a cracker run by a Williams Co. subsidiary, leaving two employees dead and more than 100 on-site contractors injured in the explosion. \nThe chemical plants in Ascension are also part of a Community Area Emergency Response group, a fee-based organization that coordinates safety and emergency response across clients and educates the community about potential industry safety hazards. Workers at Shell’s Geismar plant. \nAll of its members have radios that broadcast all interactions between any plant and the sheriff’s office in the event of an emergency. Membership is about $1,500 a year. \nFor the last 40 years, there has also been a volunteer hazardous materials team of chemical employees who report to the sheriff when activated in the event of a chemical emergency. It’s an arrangement that Sheriff Jeff Wiley highly recommends. \nNot part of that system are dozens of pipelines that snake under the parish from one facility to another. Responding to pipeline accidents isn’t nearly as regimented, Mr. Melancon said. Questions from beaver County Does Shell have it's own first responders? You’re being watched \nW hip out a camera anywhere near the perimeter of Shell’s plants in Norco and Geismar, and you can set a minute timer for the arrival of the first security guard, often followed by a sheriff deputy. \nThe chemical plants in those areas are guarded by private contractors, bomb-sniffing canine squads, and a network of cameras that record suspicious activity. \nIn Norco, the facility’s biggest threat, according to security manager Mike Cisneros, is a vehicle-borne explosive device. So every vehicle and rail car that travels through it is screened and sniffed. \nMr. Cisneros said his team has caught several suspicious people in the area and reported them to the Department of Homeland Security in recent years.
