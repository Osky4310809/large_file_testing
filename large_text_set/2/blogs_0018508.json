The multi-talented icon just wrapped up Chicago the Musical this past Sunday, and definitely ended her run with quite a splash.\nThe performer formerly known as Scary Spice played the role of Roxie Hart, and — as you’d expect — had to do a lot of singing throughout each show. While that’s a skill that comes naturally to her, she decided to pay tribute to her roots a bit by spontaneously singing a Spice Girls song .\nAnd, not just any Spice Girls song — Mel B. broke out into “Wannabe,” the hit that introduced us to the Spice Girls in the first place. Thankfully, there’s video of the performance.\nHere is a snippet of me last night doing my last show In @chicagomusical playing Roxie heart breaking character busting out some spice power haha #nyc #broadwaybaby \nA post shared by Mel B (@officialmelb) on Feb 20, 2017 at 10:10am PST \nThe bad part? Well, she managed to stop right after “from A to Z.” It’s obvious that the audience really, really wanted her to continue — but like the professional she is, Mel B. quickly jumped back into character.\nIt’s such a great moment since it really showed her lighthearted side. This is proof that she was never all that “scary” to begin with!\nBased on this video, which she also shared through Instagram , we’re really hoping that this isn’t her final brush with Broadway.\nGiggle fit,you made me do it @amrafaye \nA post shared by Mel B (@officialmelb) on Feb 20, 2017 at 12:58pm PST \nIt looks like she had an incredible time, so it’s definitely likely that she’ll resurface on the New York City stage. Mel B. seemed incredibly touched by all of the support she received from both her own fans, and fans of Chicago .\nThank you to everyone who took the time out to come see me a#on Broadway and support me,that means soooo soooo much to me thank you!!\n— Melanie Brown (@OfficialMelB) February 21, 2017 So, does all of this mean that she’s finally free to work on that rumored Spice Girls reunion ? We definitely hope so.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:57:09.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
