ADVERTISEMENT \nHeavily injured, Salvador passed away while being taken to Northlake Hospital, while her two other schoolmates, Sammy Walus and Lindsay Hofmeister were confined in separate hospitals. Katcher suffered minor injuries. \nSalvador, who hails from Bacolod City, was taking up nursing at Valparaiso University in Indiana, which organized a prayer vigil for Salvador and her recovering friends. \n“Earlier this week, we lost a beloved member of our campus community, student Samantha Salvador, as a result of a car accident involving three of her fellow nursing classmates,” the school’s Facebook update read. \nA close friend of Salvador set up a GoFundMe page to assist the family in raising funds for her funeral expenses. The page has raised $19,075 (P956,000), exceeding its $4,000 (P200,000) target.
