The eagles are making good progress,\" Commander Christophe, who heads the air safety squadron at Mont-du-Marsan in southwestern France, told Agence France-Presse (AFP).\nPolice in The Netherlands first discovered the idea of using raptors to intercept drones, training bald eagles to do so in late 2015, AFP reported. The French army took up the cause last year, but chose the golden eagle instead — a natural-born killer with a wingspan of up to seven feet, excellent eyesight, and weighing about 11 pounds — roughly the same as most drones.\nThe four \"musketeers\" were hatched atop drones, The Washington Post reported, and served food atop wrecked drones from the age of three weeks. This technique taught the birds to seize remotely piloted aircraft for food.\nThe French have been concerned about drone attacks since early 2015, when drones flew over the presidential palace. Now, Mont-de-Marsan is one of five air bases in France to boast a falconry, and the military has already ordered a second brood of eagles.\nDrones have been used for a wide variety of purposes, and some terrorists have even used them to deliver bombs in Iraq. This kind of natural defense could prove crucial in the coming years.\nFor proof of just how devastating a bird of prey can be to an unmanned aerial drone, watch this video from CNN.\nDogs, Horses, And Bears, Oh My! 5 Great Animal Heroes on the Front Lines\nCould this be the first military idea to take its cue directly from The Lord of the Rings ?\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/22/france-is-training-eagles-to-destroy-terrorist-drones/", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618640150", "http://en.rfi.fr/wire/20170220-born-killers-french-army-grooms-eagles-down-drones", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1435148126", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/21/terrorists-are-building-drones-france-is-destroying-them-with-eagles/?tid=sm_fb&utm_term=.d47eafec131f", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/uuPHF7_eWYk", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jY9QNf0sCFI"], "published": "2017-02-22T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:29:26.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
