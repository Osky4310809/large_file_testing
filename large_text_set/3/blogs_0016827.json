They were able to locate a reporter who they identified as Ortega and detailed as he entered the locker room before the permitted postgame availability. \nGlazer described the scene from the moment Brady handed off his jersey to a team staffer, to when Ortega evidently entered the locker room and left with the jersey between his arm. \nAccording to USA TODAY , Brady's missing jersey was valued around $500,000. \nHouston police chief Art Acevedo told reporters that the jersey was recovered with the help of the FBI and NFL security.
