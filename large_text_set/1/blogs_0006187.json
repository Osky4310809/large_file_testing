REUTERS/Scott Audette 5411822 \nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was arguably President-elect Donald Trump’s first major endorsement. The governor went on the campaign trail for Trump and reportedly gunned for the roles of vice-president, attorney general and secretary of homeland security. \nHe previously led Trump’s transition effort, only to be replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. \nNow Gov. Christie’s February endorsement seems to have all been for nothing. Longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone told The Daily Caller Sunday this is because Christie “got caught lying to Donald.” PALM BEACH, FL – MARCH 01: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie accompanies Republican Presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on the stage at a press conference on March 1, 2016 in Palm Beach, Florida.

The Trump confidante said this all comes as a“surprise to Trump as he was told there’d be no problems.” \nThe closing of the bridge as political payback to a New Jersey mayor ended up with two Christie aides convicted of crimes and facing up to 20 years in prison. An unnamed Trump transition source reportedly told the New York Post , “Trump thought it was shameful that Christie didn’t take the fall for [convicted aide] Bridget Kelly. Trump is really angry that Christie is sending a soccer mom to jail. He believes 100 percent that Christie was behind it all.” \nDuring the primary when Trump and Christie were still opponents, Trump said Christie “totally knew” about the bridge closing. \nStone also said there was another cause related to Bridgegate that was behind Christie being cut out of the Trump transition. This would be Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s disdain for Christie after the then-US Attorney sent his father to prison. \n“Even though he hates this narrative and he insists it’s not true, Jared Kushner has had a hard-on for Chris Christie from the time that Chris Christie sent his father to prison and it was only a matter of time before he cut his gizzard out,” Stone told TheDC. “It was always clear that when that happened Jared would attempt to deny having anything to do with it. It doesn’t matter because events played into this hands. Christie’s own actions eliminated him from being anything important in this administration.” NEW YORK, NY – NOVEMBER 08: President-elect Donald Trump embraces son in law Jared Kushner,(R), after his acceptance speech at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of November 9, 2016 in New York City.

Kushner also hadn’t forgotten his father’s imprisonment,” the New York magazine article said. “Christie’s loyalists were purged, while Kushner recruited Bill Stepien, the ruthless campaign manager that Christie fired for his role in the bridge plot, to be Trump’s political director.” \nStone also mentioned Christie’s lack of a commitment during the final weeks, canceling events and TV appearances; the Trump confidante added that this was something Trump “resented.” Stone said that Kushner elevated Bill Stepien, a former Christie aide that he says the governor “hates,” as White House Political Director because “it aggravates Christie.” \nChristie has returned from the campaign trail to serve his final year in office and face a sub-20 percent approval rating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T05:40:13.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
