Scott Applewhite, AP) 2 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWhen President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act seven years ago, he saddled Americans with a healthcare system that put the ultra-liberal agenda ahead of our best interests. We were promised that Obamacare would bring down healthcare costs with increased competition between insurance providers. We were promised we could keep our healthcare plans. We were promised that Obamacare would not raise middle class taxes. Instead, the law brought the American people rising premiums, unaffordable deductibles, fewer insurance choices and higher taxes. We were let down. \nThen, in 2014, Nancy Pelosi sought to defend the collapsing law by claiming its success should be measured by the number of people who had access to affordable healthcare and its ability to lower skyrocketing costs. \nBy Pelosi’s own standards, Obamacare has been an unmitigated failure. \nThis year alone, Obamacare premiums have gone up by an average of 25% , and in some places have risen by over 100% . Individuals have insurance that they cannot afford — high deductibles distort the meaning of coverage. Under the two most popular Obamacare health plans, thousands of families have been forced to shoulder burdensome deductibles equivalent to 10% and 6% of the median American household income . This is not affordable. \nObama’s promise of “choice” has turned out to be fiction for people living in more than 1,000 counties who are left with one insurance provider on their state exchanges. No one can deny Obamacare is in a ‘death spiral’ when the number of Americans with only one insurer from which to choose jumps from 2% to 17% in one year . This is not choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:21:54.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
