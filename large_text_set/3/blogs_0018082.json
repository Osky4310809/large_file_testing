Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA 12-year-old boy brilliantly managed to evade two members of pitch-side security during a Spain training session and meet his Real Madrid hero, Alvaro Morata. \nJulen Lopetegui's men were preparing for their 2018 World Cup qualifier against Israel on Friday when the little intruder ran on. \nThe session had just finished when the kid took his chance. Sprinting onto the pitch, the boy showed an impressive burst of pace to get away from pitch-side security. \nHe then dodged two further members of security as he made his way over to the other side of the turf. The kid bursts past a member of security (Photo: CEN) The little intruder makes his way past another (Photo: CEN) \nThe boy, who was wearing a Spain shirt with Morata '7' back to front, only had one target in mind. The boy finally meets his hero (Photo: CEN) \nAfter producing a run akin with Adrian Peterson in his prime, the pitch invader finally reaches his hero - and gives him a huge hug. \nLuckily for security (and the fan), Morata returns the hug and meets his little fan.
