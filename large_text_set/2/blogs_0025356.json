We have a lot of singers and actors and actresses so you can’t stop a person’s dreams. They see their aunts and uncles doing what they do – usually we try and be like our parents and siblings and that’s what they do.” \n“I just tell them to keep their head on straight and use good judgement,” he added. “That’s the important thing.” \nThe chat then turned whether fame is ever worth it given the downsides that come with being in the public eye. \n“That’s part of the business,” reasoned Jackie. “You’re going to have ups and downs in this industry.
